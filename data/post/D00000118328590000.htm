to anthony hammond esq

the following verses ought in justice to be yours since not only the best part of them were made at your house but they were made designedly for

you so that this is not a dedication writ to a book but a book writ to a dedication which however is the nicest part a writer has to manage for the most deserving men are the most averse to be told so and what would please all their friends and wou'd displease themselves which makes the poet at a loss whether to dissatisfie one or many his readers or his patron

but since have already found it easier to you to oblige than to receive thanks for an obligation to do no violence to your modesty must do one to my own justice and desist from a theme which could so willingly inlarge upon but you so unwillingly read

shall say little of the following essays either of the originals translated

them from or the translations one thing in general find from my own experience that where there is most life and spirit in the author the translator is carried on with the greater vigour and vivacity as a man swims faster in a stream than a standing water but where the original is flat and low the translator must be at the pains to raise him so that the best things

are the easiest to be done and the dullest the most difficult

it were presumption in one of my years to pretend to give an account of the authors whom have chosen or their works to commend their excellencies or condemn their faults and of the two dare venture to say the least of ovid when he himself and all that he has writ

have been already so well and so fully treated of in mr dryden preface before his epistles

but cannot choose but wonder that a book so extreamly delightful so sort and sweet as tibullus has lain so long unattempted· but there is a friend of ours whom hope he has been all along reserved for and then he will be in the best hands

he could have fall'n into

of the three elegies that have ventured on the first from toward the middle to the end and the whole third pleas'd me infinitely the second did meerly for the sake of the last ten or twelve lines

tibullus must certainly have felt all he writ for

he could never have feign'd so much passion so well and am apt to believe it was not his poetry made him so fond and tender a lover· but rather his love that made him so sweet and excellent a poet were it not that should take him out of better hands would have attempted to have englished him all for flatter my self with a fancy that in some things am somewhat of his temper

and how far short soever come of him in his poetry resemble him but too nearly in some other circumstances

was almost running into a complaint that would have been both unjust and ingrateful for since knew you all occasion of complaint has been taken from me
your acquaintance would have been of it self sufficient to endear you

to any man but your favours to me began with and even your acquaintance dare not proceed tho on a subject which am very loth to leave permit me to add only this that since most who ever writ have sometimes stood in need of favours from other men and since the same fortune has attended me am glad however that it threw me on you to receive them

than whom know none could have been more willingly obliged to for them

am sir your most affectionate obliged humble servant

poems upon several occasions

to the right honourable charles earl of dorset and middlesex
as nature does in infants frame with their first speech their careful fost'rer's name whose needful hands their daily food provide and by whose aid they have their wants supply'd
you are my lord the poets earliest theme and the first word he speaks is dorset name
to you the praise of every muse is due for every muse is kept alive by you
their boasted stream from your rich ocean pours and all the helicon they drink is yours

what other subject can the muses chuse

or who besides is worthy of a muse they shall to future ages make you known their verse shall give you fame but more your own
immortal wit shall its great patron boast when others of an equal rank are lost
while eating time all other tombs devours no mausoleum shall endure but yours
life to your self by your own verse you give and only you and whom you please shall live
thus you must nassau acts proclaim and farther than his trumpets sound his fame
whose hundred mouths of nothing else shall tell but him who fought and him who sung so well
ev'n after death you shall your honours share you for improving wit and he for war

to walter moyle esq

to you dear youth in these unpolish'd strains and rural notes your exil'd friend complains
with pain this tedious banishment bear from the dear town and you the dearest there
hourly my thoughts present before my view those charming joys which once alas knew in wine in love in friendship and in you
now fortune has withdrawn that pleasing scene we must not for a while appear again
here in its stead unusual prospects rise that dull the fancy and disgust the eyes
bleak groves of trees shook by the northern winds and heavy aspects of unthinking hinds

no beauteous nymph to fire the youthful heart

no swain instructed in the muses art
hammond alone is from this censure free hammond who makes the same complaint with me alike on both the want of you does strike which both repine at and lament alike while here stay condemn'd to desart fields deny'd the pleasures which the city yields my fortunes by the chance of war deprest lost at these years when might use them best
to crown your youth conspiring graces joyn honour and bounty wealth and wit are thine
with charms united every heart you move esteem in men in vanquish'd virgins love
tho clog'd with cares drag my restless hours envy not the flowing ease of yours still may they roul with circling pleasures on nor you neglect to seize them as they run

time hastes away with an impetuous flight

and all its joys soon vanish from our sight which we shall mourn we us'd not while we might
in full delights let sprightly southern live with all that women and that wine can give
may generous wicherly all sufferings past enjoy a estate at last
fortune with merit and with wit be friends and sure tho slowly make a large amends
late very late may the great dryden dye but when deceas'd may congreve rise as high
to him my service and my love commend the greatest wit and yet the truest friend
accept dear moyle a letter writ in haste which my impatient friendship dictates fast
friendship like love imperfectly exprest yet by their being so they're both shown best

each no cold leisure for our thoughts affords

but at a heat strikes out our eager words
the soul's emotion most her truth assures such as feel while subscribe me

yours

to anthony hammond esq

as when a prophet feels the god retir'd by whom he had a long time lain inspir'd his eyes no more with sacred fury roul no more divine impulses move his soul the fires that warm'd him with the god are gone the deity the charm is done
so now my muse can no more rapture boast since you went hence her inspiration's lost
robb'd of her flame all languishing she lies and only sings before she dies
but you my friend to different fortune move and crown your days with wine your nights with love
in endless bliss unbounded time you waste your ravishing delights for ever last

long long e're this you've often been possest

of all your wish could frame to make you blest
when you and southern moyle and congreve meet the best good men with the wit good wine good company the better feast and whene're wicherly is present best
then then your joys are perfectly compleat and sacred wit is at the noblest height
oh how long to be allow'd to share and gain a fame by mingling with you there
the country now can be no longer born and since you first are gone must return come come dear hammond to pursue pleasures cannot know depriv'd of you
restless as lovers till we meet live and envy this because twill first arrive
with joy learnt dryden designs to crown all the great things he has already done

no loss no change of vigour can he feel

who dares attempt the sacred mantuan still
and yet methinks owe too much to you to part so coldly with a bare adieu
but what requital can make you more you've put all recompence beyond my power
fain wou'd my working thoughts contrive a way for every generous man's in pain to pay
tis not a suitable return give yet what it is my friend receive take the best wishes of a grateful soul congreve and moyle and you possess it whole
take all the thanks a country muse can send and in accepting this oblige your friend

to esq
in vain my friend so often remove find that absence still increases love the barbarous foe like an ingrateful guest too strongly lodg'd possesses all my breast
gladly suffer'd him to share my soul but now the traitor has usurp'd it whole burn with pains too great to be endur'd and yet neither can nor would be cur'd in other ills all remedies we try but fond of this we grow content to dye
for all were useless here to help my grief and should strive in vain to find relief

in vain rush'd amidst the thund'ring war

endeavour'd all in vain to meet it there in all the heat of fight thought on her
if conquering camps refus'd to give me ease the town at my return affords me less
without concern its wealth and pomp see and all its pleasures are but lost on me if with my friends shou'd to plays resort without a smile see the comick sport
mingle no applauses with the pit nor mind the action nor the author's wit
see the shining beauties sit around but have no room left for another wound
fly for refuge to the country now but that is savage and denies it too
retirement still foments the raging fire and trees and fields and floods and verse conspire to spread the flame and heighten the desire

wildly range the woods and trace the groves

to every oak tell my hopeless loves torn by my passion to the earth fall kneel to all the gods pray to all
nothing but eccho answers to my prayer and she speaks nothing but despair despair
give relentless heaven this last reply do despair and will resolve to die

the story of phoebvs and daphne
from the first book of ovid's metamorphoses

no beauteous nymph cou'd youthful phoebus move till daphne charms inspir'd him first with love
a virgin sprung from peneus silver stream fair as the crystal waters whence she came
no blind effects of chance subdu'd the god but just revenge which injur'd cupid ow'd
for phoebus saw him as his bow he drew and scoffing cry'd those are not arms for you
to me your quiver and your shafts resign they load your shoulders but sit well on mine

your arrows drop from your enervate arm

and are not sent with force enough to harm but when shoot with my unerring hands on the fleet shaft as fleet a death attends
witness the monstrous python lately slain against whose scales your darts had been in vain he still had liv'd and ravag'd all the plain
in yonder vale by me behold him kill'd shedding his pois'nous gore o're all the field
be you content to kindle amorous fires inspiring childish loves and soft desires attempt not things beyond your feeble powers hold your own empire and usurp not ours

the slighted god in short replies by thee let other breasts be pierc'd but thine by me
as humane force is conquer'd by divine so shalt thou find my powers excelling thine

he spoke and spread his wings and mounted up

nor rested till he reach'd parnassus top
from his full quiver all his darts he drew and from them all he made his choice of two
differing the passions which their points create the one producing love the other hate with this the beauteous virgin breast he piers't but he wounds phoebus deeper with the first
high on the mountain's utmost cliff he stood and took his fatal aim and shot the god swiftly it flies thro his invenom'd reins fires all his blood and poisons all his veins
the deadly shafts their purpos'd ends obtain work love in him in her as fierce disdain
her only joy was ranging thro the grove to shun her lovers and their tales of love
there the wild boars were wounded with her spear her only passion was to conquer there

all her attire was like diana train

alike her humour in avoiding men
her numerous courtiers met with numerous slights she fled from hymen and his hated rites oft had her father prompted her to wed by fond desires of future grandson led oft had he told her that she ow'd a debt of smiling nephews which he hop'd for yet
she starts and thinks she understands him wrong nor would have heard it from another tongue
then hanging on her father thus she pray'd oh only lov'd of all your sex she said oh give me leave to live and dye a maid
he too indulgent yields but yields in vain to what she cannot from her self obtain that matchless form was made to be admir'd and she is in her own despight desir'd

the youthful phoebus courts her for his bride

and loves too fiercely to be long deny'd
with hopes he wou'd not for his godhead lose by his own oracles deceiv'd he wooes
as fires in spacious fields of stubble thrown when the first blaze of flame is once begun the winds with fury drive the torrent on so burns the god and so receives the fires and sooths with flattering hopes his fond desires· he sees her hair dishevel'd on her back and part in circles twining round her neck
if such their charms disorder'd thus he cry'd ah what if nature were with art supply'd
he sees her sparkling eyes that shine like stars but with an influence far more strong than theirs
he sees her balmy lips and longs to kiss for oh he is not satisfy'd he sees

her hands and arms fill his unwearied sight

he looks on all with wonder and delight
he sees her snowy thighs her swelling breast if ought lay hid he still concludes it best and yet in vain is all the god can say the dear disdainful virgin will not stay but flies the swifter as she hears him pray

stay daphne stay it is no foe pursues follow not as lustful satyrs use the trembling deer fly from the lyon so the lambs from wolves each from his mortal foe
they by their swift pursuit their prey design but love the tend'rest love occasions mine
beware dear maid left any barbarous thorn tear those soft limbs too beauteous to be torn
rough are the ways you follow with such speed ah yet beware be cautious how you tread

or stay or do not make such dangerous haste

too will stay or not pursue so fast

stay daphne stay ah whither do you run alas fond nymph you know not whom you shun
no rustick labouring hind no savage swain keep no lowing herds upon the plain
delphos and tenedos my rule obey in several isles several scepters sway
all nations offer incense at my shrine and all those beams that light the world are mine
jove does acknowledge me his darling son and gives me power the greatest next his own
know what time bears in her teeming womb and all that was and is and is to come
teach soft numbers to the mighty nine the wondrous harmony they make is mine

sure are the wounds send from every dart

but love made surer when he pierc'd my heart
to the sick earth safe remedies give allotting man a longer time to live to me the use of every herb is known vain art alas since love is cur'd by none
to all besides they do their aid afford unable only to relieve their lord

much more he would have told the flying fair but the regardless virgin would not hear
with doubled swiftness she the wind and leaves his yet unfinish'd speech behind
the winds that toss'd her flowing robes abroad show'd a whole heaven of beauty to the god
her naked limbs to his full view display'd the god the ravish'd god saw all the maid

her every step inflames his fierce desires

her every motion fans the raging fires
still the fair nymph grew lovelier as she fled loose in the air her golden locks were spread and her cheeks glow'd with an unusual red
th impatient god admits no more delay and throws no more unheeded words away stronger his pliant limbs he strives to move love urges on he takes new force from love
so the swift greyhound when his game he views with eager stretch o're all the plain pursues
now comes so near that he is forc'd to stoop with the false hopes he has to snatch her up
the trembling hare runs on with dreadful doubt whether she is already seiz'd or not
she uses all her art to help her flight· and doubles just enough to scape the bite

so daphne flyes wing'd with her mortal fear

wing'd with his love so phoebus follows her
but he still gains advantage in the race for love redoubles his impetuous pace· with arms expanded he pursues the fair and plyes his eager feet so very near she feels his breath warm thro her flying hair
now as her utmost force was spent and her legs began to faint her course to that delightful stream she bends which from her father's silver urn descends with moving looks the water she surveys and thus the sad and lovely suppliant prays
oh save me yet e're am quite betray'd exert your and preserve a maid
to some new form change my too charming shape
o· let me lose my being to escape

immediate grant was giv'n her as she pray'd

and sudden numness thro her limbs was spread thin films o're all her lovely frame are cast and with close folds they compass in her waste
her hair to leaves her arms to branches shoot her feet depriv'd of swiftness form the root her beauteous head chang'd to the leavy top and yet not wholly e're the god came up
for now he ran with more immoderate speed but not with haste enough embrace the maid
still lovely tho of humane shape bereft and he still loves her in the shape sh has left
he lays his hand upon the plant while yet her heart beneath the rind did pant he clasp'd her with the thought of what sh had been and oh he wish'd her still the same as then with the same scorn his kisses she disdain'd her scorn alas was all she still retain'd

have thee now such as thou art he cry'd

and thou shalt be my tree tho not my bride
my quiver shall be hung upon thy boughs and thy dear leaves be wreath'd about my brows
thou shalt the heads of adorn and be by poets and their heroes worn when caesar shall from vanquish'd nations come drawn in his chariot thro the streets of rome when to the capitol their spoils they bring and jo paeans make the temple ring then planted at augustus gilded doors thou like an houshold god shalt guard his floors
and as the tresses on my youthful head keep their first lustre still and never fade the verdant beauty of thy leaves shall last not to be wither'd by the winter's blast
thus the god finish'd and the laurel bow'd her branches down to thank the bounteous god

part of the story of iupiter and europa from the latter end of the second book of ovid's metamorphoses

greatness does always our desires oppose and majesty and love are mortal foes
jove knew too well it hinder'd the design he cou'd not compass in a form divine
he casts his eagle off and royal crown and lets his bolts fall to the pavement down
divested thus he quits the blest abode without one mark left to reveal the god he that was wont to reign and rule on high and shake the world with thunder from the sky of all the gods the most ador'd and fear'd now changes to a bull and joyns the herd

large curls adorn'd his front and hid his chest

of all he seem'd by far the noblest beast by something still distinguish'd from the rest
his whiteness did the snow excel while it remains unfully'd as it fell
his horns were small like glittering jewels bright and seem'd design'd for beauty more than fight his peaceful look no signs of fury shows he wears no marks of terrour on his brows
the royal maid beheld him with delight surpriz'd with pleasure at th unusual sight yet was her pleasure first allay'd with fear till by degrees at last advancing near with flow'rs more welcome than his heavenly food giv'n by those hands she fed the ravish'd god
softly with secret joy those hands he prest and too too eager to be wholly blest hardly ah hardly he forbears the rest

now with large leaps he bounds upon the land

anon he rolls along the golden sand
as her fears vanish'd she approach'd the beast and venturing farther stroak'd his painting breast and crown'd his horns with flowers too vent'rous at the last
more favours thus th'unwary nymph bestow'd than she had given him had he seem'd a god
still daring more down on his back she sate alas she knew not who sustain'd her weight
then then the god rose with his prey and wing'd with his success soon reach'd the sea
vain were her cries all her resistance vain while jove in triumph bore her through the main
she casts her eyes on the forsaken coast which lessen'd till the view was wholly lost

she sigh'd and wept and look'd back

yet still she held his horns still clasp'd his neck while with the winds her looser garment flow'd and spread a grateful covering o're the god

the story of cinyras and myrrha· from the tenth book of ovid's metamorphoses

far far from hence you vertuous maids remove fly from a story of incestuous love
be not a father nor his daughter near sing of things unfit for such to hear
but shou'd you listen and believe them true believe the vengeance that attends them too
if sin cou'd reach to such a dismal height and nature suffer an abuse so great yet when she bore so monstrous an offence tis well the scene was laid remote from hence
from vengeful gods our world exempted stands there are no judgments due to guiltless lands

her gums and perfumes let arabia boast

forgetful of the mighty price they cost
while myrrha spreads her impious branches there her sweets are purchas'd at a rate too dear
the god of love to clear himself from blame denies he gave the wound or rais'd the flame
the brands of furies kindled this desire and thy devoted bosom did inspire with a large share of their infernal fire
to hate your father were a dreadful fate and yet to love him thus is worse than hate
look on the princes of the shining east whose only strife is who shou'd please you best
by the loud fame of conqu'ring beauty led a royal troop of lovers court your bed from the whole world choose one and make him blest excepting one take any of the rest

she was too conscious of her impious love

which when she long had labour'd to remove her last recourse was to the powers above
by what resistless fury am driv'n defend me piety preserve me heav'n
expel this raging passion from my soul oh let me never act a crime so foul
if that's a crime which yet your partial powers allow to every kind they form but ours
all creatures else without distinction joyn regard no limits and respect no line
the feather'd kind fly mingled with their young birds pair with birds from whom of late they sprung
the lawless herds in flow'ry pastures feed and by promiscuous leaps encrease their breed

unbounded o're the spacious plains they range

choose as they please and as they please they change
wisely with nature happy brutes comply and as she prompts them they improve their joy but foolish man against himself conspires inventing laws to curb his free desires
industrious to destroy his own content he makes those bars which nature never meant
yet there are nations no such customs bind where men and women all in common joyn'd with doubled love exalt their gen'rous kind
where daughters with indulgent fathers wed and without scandal mount the genial bed
had my stars plac'd my birth in such a clime might have had my wish without a crime
might have been of all love possest like them had enjoy'd like them been blest

hence impious thoughts from my distracted brain

be gone all hopes since all alas are vain tho he possesses charms enough to move the coldest virgin to the warmth of love
yet to that warmth my passion must not rise for must view him with a daughter's eyes
vvere not so all my desires were free alas it is a sin in none but me
engag'd already in too strict a tye might be nearer were not so nigh
should piety advise me to remove where might possibly forget my love
in vain should endeavour to be gone compell'd to stay by what seek to shun
still to be present in his lovely sight still gaze on him in whom my eyes delight talk touch and kiss do more if more might

wretch that am ah whither do run

is there not too too much already done how would the act all ties of blood confound and think oh think how would your titles sound your father's whore a mother to the son born of your mother sister to your own
oh what remorse will such an action bring how fiercely will a guilty conscience sting how will the furies haunt your anxious breast and rob your soul of her eternal rest advance their torches to your dazled sight by day in visions and in dreams by night since then divine and human laws forbid our bodies e're should joyn in such a deed let not the thought it self reception find but banish it for ever from your mind

could you resolve were you so lost to shame

durst you attempt a deed you dare not name still the foul crime would his concurrence want which he ah too too good will never grant
oh that could my self from love redeem or that an equal fury reign'd in him
in thoughts like these the beauteous virgin mus'd now blam'd her guilty passion now excus'd
in the mean time th ambitious rivals strove to court the father for the daughter's love
he at a loss which prince he should prefer where all deserv'd alike consults with her
he makes their fortunes names and titles known but hides his thoughts and leaves her to her own

fix'd on his eyes the maid her silence kept

and wrack'd with secret tortures blush'd and wept
he thinking this the effect of virgin fears kiss'd her drown'd cheeks and dry'd her flowing tears
the welcome kiss shot thro her ravish'd soul and almost caus'd her to reveal the whole
again his former question he renews what choice she made where she had such to choose
frequent demands this short confession drew him like most who most resembles you
but he good man by piety betray'd mistakes the meaning and commends the maid
believes those words did from her duty flow and bids her to continue ever so

while on the ground her guilty looks she bent

for she knew better what her answer meant
twas midnight now and mankind lay refresht they and their cares in universal rest
but myrrha wakes scorch'd with impetuous fires and struggles to resist her fierce desires
despair and shame hope fear and fury roul and work a tempest in her troubled soul
like fighting winds tumultuous passions mix toss to and fro and know not where to fix as in a spacious wood a stately oak that labours long beneath the axe's stroke
with the last blow nods e're its dreadful fall and threatning every side is fear'd on all
so roll the thoughts in her uncertain mind and now to vertue now to vice inclin'd death was the only choice she could approve death a less ill as well as end of love

when strait her trembling hands a girdle tye

to the tall roof where she designs to dye
then fix'd the noose and sinking from the beam with her last words invok'd her father's name
farewel she cry'd dear cinyras farewell learn by my death what now dare not tell
the broken murmurs reach'd her nurses ears lodg'd in a small apartment joyning hers
who with amazement starting from her bed runs to the doors of the despairing maid
where enter'd by the glimm'ring tapers light her trembling eyes discern the dismal sight and a loud shriek proclaims her mortal fright
feebly she hastes to snatch her from her fate and with stretch'd hands takes down the lovely weight
then first she found the leisure to lament her words an utterance and her tears a vent

closely her aged arms her charge embrace

with floods of woe she bathes her beauteous face and streams from myrrha eyes kept equal pace
tell me your griefs she cry'd my royal care tell what occasions this accurs'd despair
her killing anguish no return affords tears blind her eyes and groans suppress her words
new fury works her rising passions high now doubled by her vain attempt to dye
still the good nurse all soft endearments us'd in hopes to learn what she was still refus'd
turn here she cries look on these silver hairs grown thus alas with sorrow more than years
look on these breasts whence your first food you drew these hands so often tir'd in holding you

think on that fondness those indulgent cares

with which rear'd you in your tender years
all these perswasions unregarded dye or tears and sighs were all the sad reply
repulse upon repulse with grief she bore yet still insists resolv'd to hazard more
let my past services says she entreat and do not do not think me useless yet
in me repose your cares on me rely on one so tender so concern'd as
your ills to what sad height soever grown shall quickly be redress'd or never known
madness by sacred numbers is expell'd and magick will to stronger magick yield
if the dire wrath of heav'n this fury rais'd heav'n is with sacrifice and prayer appeas'd
from what cause else can these disorders grow in a smooth tide your rising fortunes flow

no loss your subjects or your friends sustain

no wars disturb your father's peaceful reign
the mention of that dear that fatal name swell'd her loud sighs and spread her raging flame
yet in the nurse this no suspicion mov'd of such a crime tho she perceiv'd she lov'd
now more than ever her desires encreast having obtain'd so much to learn the rest with trembling arms she clasps the weeping maid and in her lap reclin'd her lovely head
know thou lov'st she cry'd no more conceal a truth which virgins need not blush to tell
long since its nature and its force knew and cannot wonder at it now in you

yet tho you love you have no cause to grieve

cou'd no counsel no assistance give you your own birth and beauty wou'd relieve
your chains no monarch would refuse to wear of no imperial crown need you despair
shou'd not your father whom you choose approve he shall be still a stranger to your love
again that name a cruel image brought of dreadful guilt to her distracted thought
fiercely she rose and springing to the bed be gone without reply be gone she said spare the confusion of a wretched maid
use no entreaties to me more but go you ask me that which twere a sin to know
strange terrors on the aged matron seize who falling prostrate at the virgin's knees

no arguments that might prevail forgets

but plies her now with flattery now with threats
conjures her to discover all her woes or menaces to publish all she knows
faintly at that her mournful head she rears and bathes her nurses bosom with her tears
oft wou'd the fatal secret have reveal'd which guilt and conscious shame as oft withheld
when hiding with her robes her blushing look as loth her self to hear the words she spoke
thus much at last confus'dly she exprest oh mother in your envy'd nuptials blest there breaks abruptly off and spoke in groans the rest
cold tremblings chill'd the matrons frozen blood and her faint legs scarce bear their shaking load

her hoary hairs upright with horrour rise

and ghastly fears star'd wildly in her eyes
all that she ought in such a case she said but all in vain endeavour'd to disswade the maid liv'd only that she might enjoy and if that fail'd she still knew how to dye
the thoughts of so much guilt distract the nurse but myrrha threatned death confounds her worse
live and possess she cry'd there paus'd with shame not harden'd yet enough to add a father's name
now the fix'd time for ceres feasts was near observ'd by cyprian matrons once a year all in their white and spotless garments drest such as denoted innocence the best

deny'd the space of these mysterious rites

the touch of man nine whole revolving nights
the queen in person does the pomp adorn all offering grateful gifts of early corn
thus from his bed his beauteous partner gone the widdow'd king possess'd it all alone
the nurse too diligent in ill would miss no opportunity that serv'd like this
she went and found to favour her design the vigorous prince already warm with wine then tells him of a maid with wondrous charms a mistress worthy of a monarch's arms
her face and form with myrrha she compares in beauty equal and of equal years
the king new passion from her praises caught and all inflam'd commands her to be brought

swift with the dreadful message she return'd

and found the lovely nymph where still she mourn'd
rejoice she cry'd th'approaching night shall crown all your desires the conquest is your own
no real joys on her success attend of which her soul presag'd some dismal end her labouring heart with different motions beat now fear now joy usurp'd the soveraign seat and long contending made the tumult great
all doubts at length resistless love destroys and left a fatal room for impious joys
the day was fled and no bright tracks remain'd but thro whole nature night and silence reign'd

on goes the desperate virgin to pursue

a crime too foul for heav'n's chast eyes to view
the silver moon averse to such a sight fled from her darken'd orb no streak of light no glimmering star shot through the dismal night
thrice in loud screams of woe the mourn and thrice she falls to warn her to return
no bodings cou'd the vent'rous maid recall resolv'd on ruin she contemns them all
the darkness of the night dispell'd her fears while not a blush for her bold crime appears
one hand upon her nurse supported lay holding her other stretch'd to feel the way
soon with bold steps to the dire room she comes but soon as enter'd all her fears resumes

courage her heart and blood her face forsook

her bending knees on one another strook and every loosen'd joint with horrour shook
her working thoughts a livelier prospect drew of guilt more dreadful at a nearer view
increasing fear quite damps her impious fire who now grown cold and dead to all desire repents her crime and wou'd unknown retire
but now the nurse urg'd on th unwilling maid till coming where th impatient king was laid receive she cries a virgin wholly thine and then oh breach of all things sacred and divine in hellish lust father and daughter joyn
he as less guilty felt the less of fear and in the midst of horrour comforts her

he call'd her daughter as if that exprest

his tender love and diff'rent age the best
she us'd th indearing name of father too and each gave titles to their incest due
full of her father now she leaves his bed her impious womb swoln with incestuous seed where crimes unknown and monstrous vices breed
next night their guilty pleasures they repeat another follow'd and another yet
when he desirous to behold at last the soft kind nymph whom he so oft embrac't
with a torch lighted at a fatal time discern'd at once his daughter and his crime

his rage and grief no room for words afford but speechless at the sight he snatch'd his sword

frighted she flies assisted by the night

whose darkness shelter'd and secur'd her flight
far from her country and those conscious fields unknown she wanders on through spacious wilds
till with the burden in her womb opprest her staggering limbs requir'd their needful rest
scarce knowing what to pray for and at strife betwixt the fear of death and hate of life long she revolv'd on what she thought might move and thus at last invokes the powers above

on you great gods in these extreams call just is your vengeance deserve it all
yet lest alive shou'd infection spread or my foul guilt in death pollute the dead

allow my wretched life no longer date

but by some change deny me either state

here the fair penitent concludes her prayers which heav'n still open to confession hears
she feels her legs now cover'd with the ground and her numm'd feet in welcome fetters bound
the spreading root shoots downward from her toes on which the lofty bole supported grows to pith her marrow turns her bones to wood fed by the sap which was of late the blood
her arms great boughs her fingers form the small her once soft skin now hard'ned covers all
now her big womb the rising bark supprest which now creeps higher o're her panting breast

when she impatient in her change to lose

her hated being and her cruel woes sunk down within the tree whose closing top for ever lock'd her charming beauties up
who tho she lost all other sense with life she still retains that wretched one of grief
her lasting sorrows in her tears are shown which from her bark course one another down
those tears are precious too and keep the name of that unhappy fair one whence they came

the story of ceyx and halcyone from the eleventh book of ovid's metamorphoses

argument
ceyx the son of lucifer and king of trachis a city in thessaly having been alarm'd by several prodigies prepares to go and consult apollo oracle at claros to learn the will of heav'n and receive the gods instructions his voyage the description of a storm and shipwrack the description of the god of sleep and his palace the lamentation of halcyone the daughter of eolus and wife of ceyx for the loss of her husband with the change of both into sea fowls call'd after her name halcyons are the subjects of the following verses beginning with her speech to her husband to disswade him from his intended voyage

how are you chang'd of late my love how grown

so tir'd of me so pressing to be gone what have done to make my lord remove so far from her who once had all his love is your halcyone no longer dear or to whatever place your course you steer can you enjoy your self and she not there yet if you went by land twere some relief for all that would torment me then were grief
but now at once with grief and fear opprest a thousand anxious thoughts destroy my rest and not one dawn of comfort chears my breast
the faithless seas are what alas fear must not let my ceyx venture there
oft have heard their troubled waters roar and seen their foaming waves surmount the shore

oft seen the wreck come floating to the coast

and vent'rous wretches by their folly lost
nor have seldom sad inscriptions read on marble tombs which yet inclos'd no dead
let me alone my ceyx be believ'd and be not by your flatt'ring hopes deceiv'd
trust not the seas although my father binds within his rocky caves the struggling winds
if once broke loose nought can their rage restrain they sweep o're all the earth swell all the main drive clouds on clouds by an abortive birth from their dark wombs flashing the thunder forth
more more than what my feeble words express which only represent their fury less
let me perswade for have seen them rage seen all the wars the fighting winds cou'd wage

did you like me their stern encounters know

as daring as you are you wou'd not go
if all this fail to move your stubborn mind and you will go oh leave not me behind
take me along let me your fortunes share there's nought too hard for love like mine to bear
in storms and calms together let us keep together brave the dangers of the deep the grant of this my flattering love assures which knows no joys and feels no griefs but yours
thus spoke the lovely queen all drown'd in tears nor was her husband's passion less than hers
yet wou'd he not his first resolves recall nor suff'ring her to venture hazard all

he said whate're he fancy'd might abate

her griefs although his own were full as great
yet all in vain he labour'd to remove the tender fears of her prophetick love
still the same sighs from her heav'd heart arise and the same streams still bubble at her eyes
all this succeeding not my love he cry'd the last best speech that cou'd be then apply'd
to you shou'd ceyx absence tedious seem believe that yours is not less so to him for by my father's brightest fires swear by your dear self believe my mournful dear e're twice the moon renews her blunted horns if destiny permits your love returns
this just suffic'd to ease her troubled heart and of her many cares dispel a part
and now he bids them launch without delay while she took truce with grief to sail away

that last command awak'd her sleeping fears

and she again seem'd all dissolv'd in tears
around his neck her circling arms she threw and mix'd with sighs forc'd out a faint adieu
then as he left her hold too feeble grown rob'd of her dear support to stand alone the last sad pangs at parting sunk her down
th impatient seamen call upon their lord and almost bear him thence by force aboard
then having fix'd their oars begin to sweep and cleave with stroaks the yielding deep
faintly her op'ning eyes the ship survey which bears her lord and her last hopes away
in their own tears her trembling swim which hinder'd not but she distinguish'd him

too distant now for words aloft he stands

on the tall deck and she upon the sands wafts her last farewell with her lifted hands
then as the ship drove farther from the coast and that dear object in the crowd was lost the flying bark her following eyes pursue that gone the sails employ'd her latest view
all out of sight she seeks the widow'd bed where ceyx and her self so oft were laid
but now half fill'd the sad remembrance mov'd of the dear man who made the whole belov'd
by this the gathering winds began to blow their useless oars the joyful seamen stow
then hoist their yards while loosen'd from the masts the sails receive the coming blasts

description of a storm and shipwrack

now far from either shore they plow'd their way and all behind them and before was sea
when with the growing night the winds rose high and swelling seas presag'd a tempest nigh
aloud the master cries furl all the sails no longer spread to catch the flying gales
but his commands are born unheard away drown'd in the roar of a far louder sea
yet of themselves their tasks the sailors know and are by former storms instructed now
some to the masts the struggling canvass bind and leave free passage to the raging wind

some stop the leaks while some the billows cast

back on the sea which rolls them back as fast
thus in confusion they their parts perform while fighting winds encrease th impetuous storm
amaz'd the pilot sees the waves come on too thick and fast for his weak skill to shun
on every side the threatning billows fall and art is at a loss to scape them all
the cries of men the ratling of the shrouds floods dash'd on floods and clouds encount'ring clouds
fierce winds beneath above a thund'ring skie unite their rage to work the tempest high
vast billows after billows tumbling come and rolling seas grow white with angry foam to mountainous heights the swelling surges rise waves pil'd on waves seem equal with the skies

now rushing headlong with a rapid force

look black as hell to which they bend their course
the ship on rising seas is lifted up and now seems seated on a mountain top surveying thence the stygian lakes that flow and roll their distant waters far below now downwards with the tumbling billows driv'n from hell's profoundest depth looks up to heav'n
waves after waves the shatter'd vessel crush all sides alike they charge on all they rush
while with a noise th assaulting billows roar as loud as batt'ring rams that force a tow'r
as lyons fearless and secure from harms rush with prodigious rage on pointed arms chaf'd if repuls'd they run the fiercer on and lash themselves to fury as they run

so roll the seas with such resistless force

and gather strength in their impetuous course now start the planks and leave the vessel's sides wide open to receive the conquering tides in at the breach the raging waters come all pressing to pursue their conquest home
fierce neptune now who long alone had strove as if too weak himself seeks aid from jove
vvhole heav'n dissolves in one continued rain descending in a deluge to the main vvhose mounting billows toss it back again· seeming by turns each other to supply the sky the seas and now the seas the sky· showers join with vvaves and pour in torrents down and all the floods of heav'n and earth grow one
no glimpse of light is seen no sparkles flye from friendly stars thro the benighted sky

double the horrour of the night is grown

the tempest's darkness added to her own till thund'ring clouds strike out a dismal light more dreadful than the depth of blackest night
upwards the waves to catch the flames aspire and all the rolling surges seem on fire
now o're the hatches mad with rage they towre and strive possess'd of them to conquer more as a brave souldier whom the strong desire and burning thirst of glory set on fire vvith more than common ardour in his breast and higher hopes spurr'd farther than the rest oft scales in vain a well defended town but mounts at length and leaps victorious down
alone of all the dreadful shock abides while thousand others perish by his sides

so the tenth billow rolling from afar

more vigorous than the rest maintains the war now gains the deck and with success grown bold pours thence in triumph down and sacks the hold
part still without the batter'd sides assail and where that led the way attempt to scale
as in a town already half possest by foes within it and without it prest
all tremble of their last defence bereft and see no hope of any safety left
no aid their oft successful arts can boast at once their courage and their skill is lost
helpless they see the raging waters come each threatens death and each presents a tomb

one mourns his fate in loud complaints and tears

another more astonish'd quite forbears from sighs or words too faint to tell his fears
this calls them bless'd who funeral rites receive possess'd in quiet of a peaceful grave
this rears his suppliant hands unto the sky and vainly looks to what he cannot spy
this thinks upon the friends he left behind and his now orphan children rack his mind halcyone alone cou'd ceyx stir his anxious thought ran all alone on her
one farewell view of her was all his care and yet he then rejoic'd she was not there
for a last look fain wou'd he turn his eyes on her abode but knows not where it lies

the seas so whirl with such prodigious might

while pitchy clouds obscuring heav'n from sight encrease the native horrour of the night
now splits the mast by furious whirlwinds torn and now the rudder to the seas is born
a billow with those spoils encourag'd rides aloft in triumph o're the lower tides
thence as some god had pluck'd up rocks and thrown whole mountains on the main she tumbles down
down goes the ship with her unhappy freight unable to sustain the pressing weight
part of her men along with her are born sunk in a gulph whence they must ne're return
part catch at planks in hopes to float to shore or stem the tempest till its rage were o're

ev'n ceyx of the like support possest

swims undistinguish'd now among the rest
to his wife's father and his own prefers his ardent vows for help which neither hears to both repeats his still neglected prayer calls oft on both but oftner calls on her
the more his danger grew the more it brought her dear remembrance to his restless thought
whose dying wish was that the friendly stream wou'd roll him to those coasts whence late he came to her dear hands to be interr'd by them
still as the seas a breathing space afford halcyone rehears'd forms every word
half of her name his lips now sinking sound when the remaining half in him was drown'd
an huge black arch of waters which had hung high in the gloomy air and threat'ned long

bursting asunder hurls the dreadful heap

all on his head and drives him down the deep
his father lucifer that dismal night sought to retire to shun the tragick sight
but since he cou'd not leave his destin'd sphere drew round the blackest clouds to veil him there

mean while his wife counts every tedious hour and knew not yet she was a wife no more but works two robes against his wish'd return to be by her and her dear ceyx worn
she pays her vows to every pow'r divine but pays them frequentest at juno shrine
bribes every goddess at a mighty cost of precious gums but still bribes her at most
vain were the gifts she offer'd in her fane she made her loaded altars smoak in vain

where for his life and safe return she pray'd

who was already lost already dead
let me again she cry'd my ceyx see and while away by your severe decree let him give none the love that's due to me
let none she pray'd before me be preferr'd and this alone of all her prayers was heard
the pitying goddess wou'd no more receive vows for that succour which she cou'd not give
but from her altar shakes her awful hand and gives her faithful iris this command

haste quickly where the drowsie god of sleep remote from day does his dark mansions keep
tell him bid him in a dream reveal to sad halcyone how ceyx fell
all her misfortunes in her sleep unfold and by the vision let her loss be told

thus speaks the queen of heav'n nor iris stays

to make reply but as she speaks obeys
strait in a thousand colour'd robe array'd and all her orient bow o're heav'n display'd downwards she slides to find the dark abode and bear her message to the slothful god

description of the god of sleep and his palace

near the cimmerians hid from human sight lies a vast hollow cave all void of light
where deep in earth the god his court maintains and undisturb'd in ease and silence reigns
not seen by phoebus at his morning rise nor at with his most piercing eyes nor when at evening he descends the skies

thick gloomy mists come steaming from th ground

and the fog spreads a dusky twilight round
no crested fowls foretell the day's return nor with shrill notes call forth the springing morn
no watchful dogs the secret entry keep nor geese more watchful guard the court of sleep
no tame nor savage beast dwells there no breeze shakes the still boughs or whispers through the trees
no voice of man is heard no human call sounds through the cave deep silence reigns o're all
yet from the rock a silver spring flows down which purling o're the stones glides gently on

her easie streams with pleasing murmurs creep

at once inviting and assisting sleep
at the cave's mouth spring pregnant poppies up and hide the entrance with their baleful top
whose drowsie juice affords the nightly birth of all the sleep diffus'd and shed on earth
no guards the passage to this court secure no jarring hinge sustains a creaking door
yet in the midst with sable coverings spread high but unshaken stands a downy bed
where his soft limbs the slothful monarch lays dissolv'd in endless luxury and ease
fantastick dreams lie scatter'd on the ground and compass him in various figures round
more num'rous than the sands that bind the seas or ears of standing corn or leaves on trees
but iris now arriv'd divinely bright fills all the palace with unusual light

her garments flowing with diffusive beams

gild the dark cell and chase the frighted dreams
away they fly to leave her passage clear and shun the glories which they cannot bear
the god his struggle to unloose seal'd by his deep unbroken slumbers close
half way his head he rears with sluggish pain which heavily anon sinks down again
frequent attempts without success he makes but at the last with long endeavour wakes
half rais'd and half reclining in his bed and leaning on his hands his nodding head
with fault'ring words he asks the heav'nly fair what message from her goddess brought her there at once the god and goddess she obeys deliv'ring her commands in words like these

thou peace of mind thou most propitious pow'r

thou meekest deity that men adore
thou who giv'st ease to ev'ry troubled breast and set'st tir'd limbs and fev'rish souls at rest
thou at whose presence cares and sorrows flee under whose guard the fetter'd slave is free lovers the worst of slaves still finding ease in thee
send thou a dream assuming ceyx form like him appearing shipwrack'd in a storm
from whose pale lips his widow'd queen may know his certain loss and her as certain woe

here ends the shining nymph who dares not stay for farther words but flies in haste away

she feels the thick'ning mists begin to rise

and conqu'ring sleep steal o're her yielding eyes
thence by her painted bow her course she bends and the same way she came again ascends
around his drowsie goes the god and chuses morpheus from among the crowd
none can like him a perfect man express his speech and meen his action and his dress
but he alone in human shape appears while the less noble forms a second wears of snakes or birds of lyons or of bears
still there's a third still meaner in degree which shows a field a river or a tree
of things inanimate presents the scene hills valleys ships or houses earth or main
these three to generals kings or courts belong more vulgar dreams wait the more vulgar throng

the first of these their monarch sets at large

dispatch'd to trachis on charge
then slagg'ring he returns and seeks his bed in whose soft down he sinks his drooping head
again his are with sleep opprest and the whole god dissolves again to rest

swift as a thought and secret as the night morphesis on noiseless pinions takes his flight
his fleeting wings their silent course pursue soft as the liquid air they travell'd thro who now arriv'd lays by his useless plumes and ceyx form in his own court assumes
naked he stood as late bereav'd of life close by the bed of his unhappy wife
his hair still dropping seem'd still wet his beard still shivering with the cold all his pale frame appear'd

when with a mournful gesture o're the bed

pensively hanging his dejected head all drown'd in well dissembled tears he said

is not your ceyx wretched woman known is he so alter'd or forgot so soon turn here halcyone behold him lost or in your ceyx stead behold his ghost
to the relentless gods in vain you pray'd you are deceiv'd alas and am dead
surpriz'd by storms in the aegean sea which cast my life and all thy hopes away
where as call'd on thy lov'd name my breath with half thy name pronounc'd was stop'd in death
this from no doubtful messenger you hear tis who tell it who perish'd there

arise and weep now let your eyes run o're

your ceyx is alas no more
let a few tears be to my mem'ry paid and as you lov'd me living mourn me dead
he speaks and adds to these his doleful words a voice she too well knew express'd her lord's
the same the gesture of his hands appears unforc'd his action and unfeign'd his tears
she frighted with the vision sighs and weeps torn with most mortal anguish as she sleeps then stretches out her arms to hold him there which came back empty thro the yielding air
stay stay she cries ah whither wou'd you now we'll go together if again you go
with her own voice and her dead husband's sight starting she leaves her dream but not her fright

awak'd she turns her fearful eyes around

and looks for him who cou'd no more be found
for now her maids rais'd with her shrieks were come and with their lamps enlighten'd all the room
not seeing what she sought enrag'd she tare at once her face her habit and her hair
when ask'd the cause whence such despair shou'd spring and what sad loss cou'd such distraction bring she wrings her hands and beats her panting breast long silent with a load of sorrow prest but thus at last her cruel loss confest

there's no halcyone ah none she cry'd with ceyx dearer than her self she dy'd

now let no sounds of comfort reach my ear

all mention of a future hope forbear leave me oh leave me to my just despair
ah these these eyes my shipwrack'd lord did see and knew too well it cou'd be none but he
these hands stretch'd in hopes to make him stay but from these hands he slid unfelt away
no mortal grasp cou'd hold his fleeting ghost and a second time my ceyx lost
he look'd not with the same majestick grace as when he liv'd nor shone his awful face with the peculiar glories of his heav'nly race
his eyes were fix'd and all their fires gone out no longer roll'd their sparkling beams about

the colour from his faded cheeks was fled

and all his beauty with himself lay dead retaining nought of all except the shade
retaining still tho all the rest was gone too much alas to make his shadow known
pale wan and meagre by the bed he stood his hair still dropping with the briny flood
here here in this ah this unhappy place twas here he stood she cry'd and sought to trace but found no footsteps of his airy pace
oh this this my too true presaging soul divin'd when you forsook me to pursue the wind
but since compell'd by rigorous fate you went and this was destin'd for the sad event
oh that together we had put to sea that so with you it might have swallow'd me

absent i'm lost and ah tho not with you

yet am wreck'd yet am ruin'd too
oh were sprung from a most savage kind my soul as barb'rous as the seas or wind if now you are gone shou'd wish to stay behind
no ceyx no my lord come and tho not laid together in a tomb tho far from mine your floating corps is born nor with my ashes mingled in an urn yet on one marble shall our names be told and the same stone shall both our stories hold
where ages yet unborn with praise shall read how disdain'd to live when you were dead

here choak'd with grief she the sad tale gave o're

her swelling sorrows wou'd permit no more
sobs mingling with her words their accents part and sighs fly faster from her throbbing heart
now dawns the day when she with fearful haste goes to that shore where she had seen him last
there while she stood reflecting on her loss forgetting nought that might augment her woes
here he took leave she cry'd and here she said unwilling to be gone again he staid he gave me here alas the last embrace then launch'd from this ah this unhappy place

while all that past she labour'd to recall

severely for her self rememb'ring all
and while around her watry eyes survey the coast and the still troubled sea something she spies from far come floating on tho at the first too distant to be known which as the tide drove nearer to the coast presents a man in a late shipwrack lost
she pities him whom yet she does not know and mourns his fate since ceyx perish'd so
pities his wife if he a wife had left like her of all she reckon'd dear bereft
now floating nearer to the fatal shore she eyes him more distinctly than before while all her hopes diminish all her fears grow more
apace her beating heart begins to pant and all at once her sinking spirits faint

now on the beach by tossing billows thrown

the coarse was to her sad confusion known her self the wise she mourn'd the man her own
tis he she cry'd my dear my shipwrack'd lord whom but too too justly have deplor'd
then with her hands stretch'd to him where he lay she said what grief wou'd give her leave to say
fed with false hopes have your absence born and is it thus ah thus that you return and do live and you bereav'd of life ah wretched man but more more wretched wife far in the sea a peer erected stood to break the rapid fury of the flood

thither almost beyond belief she springs

born thro the yielding air on wings
along the surface of the sea she flies and wonders at her own unusual cries now hov'ring o're his pale and bloodless coarse in notes laments her sad divorce now stooping perches on his watry face and gives him with her bill a strange embrace
whether he felt it or the circling flood then chanc'd to move him is not yet allow'd yet he took sense from her transporting touch ev'n in the dead the force of love is such
aloft his now reviving head he rears and mounts on pinions which resemble hers
both chang'd to birds their wings together move and nought remain'd unchang'd except their love

in close embraces as before they joyn'd

and now o're seas produce and spread their kind
seven days she sits upon her floating nest while each rude blast imprison'd and supprest close in its cavern leaves the sea at rest
then every sail may safely trust the deep while all the winds lye hush'd the waves asleep

the first elegy of the first book of tibullus
let others add to their encreasing store till their full coffers can receive no more let them plow land on land and field on field and reap whate're the teeming earth can yield whom neighb'ring foes in constant terrour keep disturb their labours and distract their sleep

me may my poverty preserve from strife

in slothful safety and an easie life while my small house shields off the winter sky and daily fires my glowing hearth supply while the due season yields me ripen'd corn and cluster'd grapes my load'ned vines adorn while with delight my country wealth view and my pleas'd hands their willing tasks pursue still as one vine decays to plant a new
here repine not to advance the prong and chide and drive the sluggish herds along nor am asham'd to lift a tender lamb on the cold ground forsaken of her dam duely the annual festivals keep to purge my shepherd and to cleanse my sheep

to pay the usual offerings of a swain

to the propitious goddess of the plain
whom adore however she appears a stock or stone whatever form she wears
to all our country deities shew religious zeal and give to all their due
the first fair product of the fertile earth to the kind pow'r whose favour brings it forth
to ceres garlands of the ripest corn which hung in wreaths her temple gates adorn
pears apples on priapus are bestow'd my garden fruits giv'n to my garden god
you too my lares shall your gifts receive and share the little that i've left to give
once in full tides you knew my fortunes flow but at their lowest ebb you see them now
then had large and numerous lands to boast your care is lessen'd now as they are lost

then a fat calf a victim us'd to fall

now from my little flock a lamb is all
that still shall bleed and for the rest attone and that you still may challenge as your own
round which our youth shall pray you powers divine bless with your smiles our labours and assign fields full of corn a vintage full of wine
hear us ye kind propitious lares hear nor slight our presents nor reject our pray'r
take the small offerings of as small a board nor scorn the drink our earthen cups afford
whose use at first from country shepherds came and nature first instructed them to frame
let from my slender folds the thieves abstain they ought not to attempt so poor a swain

do not beg to have my wealth restor'd

again of large estates the restless lord
all my ambition is alone to save the little all my fortune pleas'd to leave nor shall e're repine while fate allows a little corn and wine a little house and a small bed for pleasure and repose
how am ravish'd in my delia arms to lye and listen to the winter storms securely in my little cottage stow'd hear the bleak winds and tempest sing abroad and while around whole nature seems to weep by the soft falling rain be lull'd asleep
this be my fate this all my bliss and can live ye gods content with this
let others by their toils their fortunes raise they merit wealth who seek it thro the seas

pleas'd with my small but yet sufficient store

wou'd not take their pains to purchase more
wou'd not dwell on the tempestuous main nor make their voyages to meet their gain
but safe at home stretch'd on a grassy bed where the trees cast a cool refreshing shade free from the heat recline my head
close by the banks of a clear river lye and hear the silver stream glide murmuring by
oh rather perish all the mines of gold and all the riches earth and ocean hold than any maid shou'd my long absence mourn or grow impatient for my wish'd return
you my messala in the field delight war is your province all your pride to fight

from sea and land crown'd with success you come

and bring your spoils in triumph home while detain'd by delia conquering charms enjoy no honours and endure no harms
who from all ambitious thoughts am free or all my delia are to live with thee with thee to lengthen out my slothful days wrapt in safe quiet and inglorious ease alike despising infamy and praise
with thee cou'd my self to work apply submit to any toil so thou wert by
with my own hands my own possessions till drive my own herds so thou wert with me still
with thee no drudg'ry wou'd uneasie be all wou'd be soften'd with the sight of thee

and if my longing arms might thee embrace

tho on the cold hard earth or rugged grass the mighty pleasure wou'd endear the place
who can in softest down be reckon'd blest whose unsuccessful love destroys his rest when nor the purple coverings of his bed nor the fair plumes that nod above his head nor all his spacious fields nor pleasant house nor purling streams can lull him to repose what foolish brave allow'd by thee to taste thy balmy breath to press thy panting breast rifle thy sweets and run o're all thy charms and melt thy beauties in his burning arms wou'd quit the vast delights which thou cou'dst yield for all the honours of the dusty field let such as he his wars pursue and conqu'ring there leave me to conquer you

let him adorn'd in all the pomp of war

sit on his prancing horse and shine afar
proud when the crowd assembles to behold his troops in polish'd steel himself in gold
at my last hour all shall wish to see all shall love to look on will be thee
close by my may my delia stand that may grasp her with my fainting hand breathe on her lips my last expiring sighs and full of her dear image shut my eyes
then delia you'll relent and mourn my fate and then be kind but kind alas too late
on my pale lips print an unfelt embrace and mingling tears with kisses bathe my face

from your full eyes the flowing tears will stream

and be like me lost in the fun'ral flame
know you'll weep and make this rueful moan you are not flint you are not perfect stone
wrong not my ghost my delia but forbear from this unprofitable grief and spare your tender cheeks and golden locks of hair
in the mean time let us our joys improve spend all our hours our years our lives in love
grim death pursues us with impatient haste and age its sure forerunner comes too fast
the sweets of life are then no more enjoy'd and love the life of all is first destroy'd

that first departs from our declining years

from weak decrepid limbs and hoary hairs
now let us now enjoy the full delight while vig'rous youth can raise it to the height while we can storm a stubborn damsel's door and with our quarrels make our pleasure more
am the general here and this my war and in this fight to conquer all my care
all other battels hence all other arms go carry wounds to those who covet harms
give them the wealth their wars can yield with all the bloody harvest of the field

while at home my ease secure

contented with my small but certain store above the fear of want or fond desire of more

the fourth elegy of the second book of tibullus

see the chains ordain'd me to receive and the fair maid whose charms have won her slave
no more my native freedom can boast but all my once lov'd liberty is lost

yet why such heavy fetters must wear

and why obey a mistress so severe why must drag such a perplexing chain which tyrant love will never loose again whether merit her esteem or scorn offending or deserving still burn
ah cruel maid these scorching flames remove extinguish mine or teach your self to love
oh rather than endure the pains feel how would chuse so to shake off my ill to grow a senseless stone fix'd on a barren hill or a bleak rock amidst the seas be set by raging winds and rolling billows beat for now in torment support the light and in worse torment waste the lingring night
my crowding griefs on one another roul and give no truce to my distracted soul

no succour now from sacred verse find

nor can their god himself compose my mind
the greedy maid will nought but gold receive and that alas is none of mine to give
hence hence unprofitable muse remove hence if you cannot aid me in my love
no battels now my mournful lines recite sing not how the roman legions fight nor how the sun performs his daily race nor how the moon at night supplies his place
all that wish the charms of verse may prove is for a free access to her love for that alone is all my constant care be gone ye muses if you fail me there

but by rapine must my gifts procure or lie unheard unpity'd at her door

or from the shrines of gods the trophees bear

and what rob from heaven present to her treat her at other goddesses expence and cost but treat her at the charge of venus most
her chiefly shall my daring hands invade to this misery am by her betray'd she gave me first this mercenary maid
to all ages let him stand accurst who e're began this trade in loving first who e're made silly nymphs their value know who will not yield without their purchase now
he was the fatal cause of all this ill and brought up customs we continue still
hence first the doors of mistresses were barr'd and howling dogs appointed for their guard
but if you bring the price the mighty rate at which her beauties by her self are set

the barrs unloos'd lay open every door

and ev'n the conscious mastiffs bark no more
whate're unwary inconsiderate god beauty on mercenary maids bestow'd how ill to such was the vast present giv'n who sell th invaluable gift of heav'n oh how unworthily were such endow'd with so much ill confounding so much good· from hence our quarrels and our strifes commence all our dissentions take their spring from hence
hence tis so few to cupid altars move and without zeal approach the shrines of love
but you who thus his sacred rites prophane and shut his vot'ries out for sordid gain may storms and fire your wealth pursue and what you took from us retake from you

while we with pleasure see the flames aspire

and not a man attempts to quench the fire or may you haste to your eternal home and no fond youth no mournful lover come to pay the last sad service at your tomb while the kind gen'rous she who scorn'd to prize or rate her self at less than joys for joys
tho she her lib'ral pleasures shou'd and reach an age unfit to take or give yet when she dies she shall not die unmourn'd nor on her fun'ral pile unwept be burn'd but some old man who knew her in her bloom with reverence of their past delights shall come and with an annual garland crown her tomb

then shall he wish her in her endless night

her sleep may pleasing be her earth be light

all this my cruel fair is truth tell but what will unregarded truth avail love his own way his empire will maintain and have no laws prescrib'd him how to reign
he rules with too too absolute a sway and we must in our own despight obey
shou'd my fair tyrant nemesis command her humbled slave to sell his native land all at her order shou'd convert to gold nor house nor remain unsold

take the most baneful simples circe us'd or mad medea in her bowls infus'd

gather the deadliest herbs and rankest weeds

the magick country of thessalia breeds mingle the surest poysons in my cup and let my love command i'll drink them up

the thirteenth elegy of the fourth book of tibullus
to his mistress

no other maid my settled faith shall move no other mistress shall supplant your love
my flames were seal'd with this auspicious vow that which commenc'd them then confirms them now

in you alone my constant pleasure lies

for you alone seem pleasing in my eyes
oh that you seem'd to none but me divine let others look with other eyes than mine
then might of no rival youth afraid all to my self enjoy my charming maid
i'm not ambitious of the publick voice to speak your beauties or applaud my choice none of their envious praises are desir'd wou'd not have the nymph love admir'd
he that is wise will not his bliss proclaim nor trust it to the lavish tongue of fame but a safe silent privacy esteem which gives him joys unknown to all but him to woods and wilds cou'd with thee remove secure of life when once secure of love
to wait on thee cou'd desart paths explore where never human footstep trod before

peace of my soul and charmer of my cares

thou courage of my heart thou conqu'rour of my fears
disposer of my days unerring light and safe conductress in my darkest night
thou who alone art all wish to see thou who alone art all the world to me
shou'd the bright dames of heav'n the wives of gods to court my bed forsake their blest abodes with all their charms endeav'ring to divert my fix'd affections and estrange my heart to thee vain rivals all the train shou'd prove vain suit the glorious nymphs to me shou'd move who wou'd not change thee for the queen of love
all this swear by all the powers divine but swear by juno most because she's thine

fool that am to let you know your power

on this confession you'll insult the more in fiercer flames make your poor vassal burn and treat your suppliant slave with greater scorn· but take it all all that can confess and oh believe me that feel no less· to thee my fate entirely resign my love and life and all my soul is thine
you know my cruel fair you know my pains and pleas'd and proud you see me drag your chains
but if to venus for succour flee she'll end your tyrant reign and rescue me

a song


after the pangs of fierce desire the doubts and hopes that wait on love and feed by turns the raging fire how charming must fruition prove


when the triumphant lover feels none of those pains which once he bore or when reflecting on his ills he makes his present pleasure more


to mariners who long have lain on a tempestuous ocean tost the storms that threatned on the main serve only to indear the coast

a farewell to poetry

as famish'd men whom pleasing dreams delude seem to grow full with their imagin'd food appease their hunger and indulge their taste with fancy'd dainties while their visions last
till some rude hand breaks up the flatt'ring scene awaken'd with regret they starve again

so the false muse prepares her vainer feasts

and so she treats her disappointed guests she promises vast things immortal fame vast honour vast applause a deathless name but well awake we find it all a dream
she tells soft tales with an inchanting tongue and lulls our souls with the bewitching song how she alone maltes heroes truly great how dead long since she keeps them living yet
shews her pernassus like a flow'ry grove fair and delightful as the bowers above the fittest place for poetry and love
we hunt the pleasures thro the fairy coast till in our fruitless search our selves are lost
so the great artist drew the lively scene where hungry birds snatch'd at the grapes in vain

tir'd with the chase give the phantom o're

and am resolv'd to be deceiv'd no more

thus the fond youth who long in vain has strove with the fierce pangs of unsuccessful love with joy like mine breaks the perplexing chain freed by some happy chance from all his pain with joy like mine he grows himself again

finis

how albertus king of arigon falling into a languishing disease was advised by his physitians to provide for death the news being spread over the countrey many magitians came to him who told him that if he could recover the golden eagle from the queen of he should questionless recover his health

albertus having of late buried the soul of his life lycimmena his most indulgent quéen fell into extreme melancholly which as it is commonly the parent of all diseases so it brought him into a most tedious and languishing sickness which caused him to make mone both day and night witness the bitter groanes and passionate expressions for the ldss of his departed consort at last being importuned by several of his nobles and hourely intreated by his thrée sonnes cruentius and innocentine he consented to send for the chiefest doctors in those parts to consult about the state and welfare of his body which doctors being arrived were presently conducted to the kings chamber at whose the king broke out into these sad expressions

ye are come to looke upon a declining king ye may endeavour to use your skils but am confident your labours will be lost
alas my disease is too inward to be found out and if ye cure

me it must be more by miracle then skill if ye can cure an almost broken heart or repaire my halfe decayed lungs or restore my near wasted breath then draw near but alas my lysimena and there his sighs denying him liberty of speech he made signes to be no more troubled and turning from the company and almost from his own senses he groaned himself into a deep melancholly

the doctors as yet being not throughly acquainted with his disease verily supposed him departing but it probed otherwise for his sonnes and the rest of the nobilitie informing the doctors of his griefe desired them to use their best endeavours for his recoverie which accordingly they did but finding little hopes of life in respect that the distemper of his mind had so much impaired the temper of his body they only prescribed him cordials which indéed something revived and exhilarated his spirits but could not give the least hopes of life in respect that nature was much extenuated and weakned by his extraordinary melancholly
the king whether less insensible of his disease or somewhat more enlivened by the prescriptions of the doctors destres two of the ablest of them to be brought unto him of whom he demanded their frée and absolute opinions the doctors after a short pause who having more respect to conscience then gaine told him that they might prolong but not cure and being about to procéed into further discourse there suddenly came in some of nobilitie and whispered with one of the doctors which the king perceiving demanded the cause to which his nobilitie replyed that there were newly arrived several magicians who hearing of his majesties distemper came out of affectionate duty to imploy their skils for his recoverie the king hearing this dismist the doctors and admitted the magitians who being entred and after the performance of their several duties applyed themselves in this manner

most renowned sir we the most humblest of all your servants being by report informed of your majesties heavy and grievous disease have by our industry found out a meanes which though it may seem impossible to your majestie will without

question restore you to your former health which meanes craving the favour of your majesties parience we shall forthwith cover

know then most excellent prince that under the jurisdiction of agrippina that most famous and invincible quéen of there is a golden eagle in whom there is a secret and infallible remedy for your disease therefore if any of those heroicke spirits which are belonging to your majestie that will endeavour to procure this eagle your majesties life will questionless be preserved we shall not therefore trouble your majesties eares with any further relation but leave your majestie to the prosecution of what we have relateds only we will be bold to desire your majestie not to be doubtful for be than your majestie shall least respect or expect shall performe this dangerous and almost impossible designe so we leave your majesty to your most serious considerations

the magitians being gone the king sends for his three sonnes and acquaints them with what the magitians had told him proffering to divide his estate between them if them could recover the eagle from the queen of wishing them to take what treasure they would for their occasions

the magitians being departed the king immediately gave command that his thrée sonnes should come unto him and they as diligent to obey as he was willing to command forthwith presented themselves before him the king after some discourse told them that now his dayes were near finished and nature began so much to decline in him that he was past the skill of doctors therefore let me advise you as a dying father that as ye were born brothers in nature so to continue in affection
sir replyed the eldest if it please the gods to dispose of you to death labour for that portion of content

which may be proportionable to our sorrows for the decrees of fate are not to be resisted and our reason tells us that what we cannot remedy we must patiently endure but for my part dere say as much for my brothers would willingly hazard my life for the prolongation of yours
sir hope that you will please to apprehend that the possessions which are like to fall to us after your death do not any way incite us either to hope or wish for your death with that the two other brothers not able to containe any longer desired their father to imploy them in any thing whereby they might exprese their obedience to him to which the king joyful to sée their passionate obedience replyed that there was but one way to save his life which was to do according to the directions of the magitians who informed him that if he could by any means recover the from the quéen of ivyland that then he should be restored to his former health but sayes he find it a thing impossible therefore shall not trouble my self with the thoughts of obtaining it for the quéen is of that power and strength that if should perswade any to attempt it should be guilty of their deaths and so depart this world with a burthened conscience but my sonnes am very well content to leave those slaveries which are attendants to a crowne can only pray for you and that's my uttermost

before the king had made an end of his intended discourse sonnes interrupted him with fighes that floated in teares and as well as their sorrows would permit they in most humble manner the king to grant them a bonne before his departure to which the king pleasingly replyed enjoy your desires provided ye ask what is necessary for me to give speak what is your boon to which they replyed

renowned sir it was not long since you were pleased to bless our eares with the discourse of the magitians who have assured both you and us that if the golden eagle can be recovered your health shall be renewed then know sir that as our bodies are derivatives from you so they are by all laws whatsoever

to be at your disposing and here we present our selbes before you and protest with all our souls to hazard nay lose our lives but we will obtaine the eagle for you know sir that resolution backt with obedient affection knows no imposs ivilities sir we shall not arise from our knees till you have granted our request and at your royal consent we will forthwith flye into action

the king seeing them so resolved thought it superfluous to endeavour to discourse them out of their resolutions but told them that since their obedience made them so ready to undertake so great a hazard his affections should promp him at their return to divide all his treasure which at that time was very great amongst them in the mean time he advised them to provide themselves with what money they would and all other accoutrements necessary for their adventure which they accordingly did

how the kings three sonnes provided for their journey and took leave of their father and departed and what happened between them in their journey

the three brothers having prepared themselves for their journey came in humble manner to take leave of king who they found as formerly very much troubled with melancholly but the eldest addressing himself unto him began in this manner

royall sir

we your most obedient sonnes in order to our dear affections more then your royal command present our selves to crave your blessing upon us and our destgnes before our departure not despairing of our desires we humbly

the king looking upon them with a countenance that imported

unexpressable grief for their departure raised himself from his pillow and with a stretched out arme gave them his blessing withal advising them as they were brothers in nature so to continue brothers in affaction and to have a care that naither eaby nor ambition or ambitious enby should raise a factious difference amongst them but as departed brothers and so consequently friends so they should adventure and return in the like amitie they departed and so the greatest blessing a dying father can bestew upon his departing children accompanie you but before you go let me as a father advise you of two things the one is the displeasure of the gods by the neglect of your duty to them the others is the danger of evil companie which may seduce you to many inconveniencies and so farwel what want in words shall supply in thoughts

thus these three brothers having received the summe of their destres departed from the presence of their father and so taking leave of their friends at court departed at last having journeyed three dayes they came by the mistake of their way into a great wood where being in a wilderness of doubt they consulted what was best to do the elder brother beginning already to find the incumbrances of travel exprest himself to the others as follows wee sée dear brothers the many troubles the want of consideration brings upon us we have as have it in my more serious thoughts undertaken a most dangerous troublesome and almost inpossible design to prevent this shall we advise if we should return home we should turn our noble undertakings to ignominie and shame and it we proceed without question we shall lose our lives and what will the world say but this they have the effect of their rasbuess for the more dangerous a designe is the more it ought to be discust but that like phaeton mount at imposs vilities shall at last fall like phaeton with shame and dishonour therefore brothers let me hear your advice to which cruentius the second brother replyed

tis true rash beginnings have most commonly fatal conclusions for my part as yet never weighed the business nor the danger but altogether depended upon your judgment as an oracle not dreaming but you had known she difficultie of the bustness but stay now better consider the matter methinks it should not be so difficult for sure we three can conquer one eagle for brother you shall catch her and will warant you my brother and will hold her but where shall we find her fle brother quoth philonzo sie you as much erre in the matter as did in the manner of the bustness
this eagle is a bird kept for her soveraigntie in a great city walled round with brass pallazado'd with yron guarded with lyons and dragons and commanded by gyants and we must before we come to this city encounter with several knights which attend purposely for such attempters as we must be many have attempted but never any as yet returned to tell the manner of their attempts therefore brother the business is of more intricacy then you imagine
monstrous cryed cruentius am more then half dead already with the relation talke no more of it
what dragons and bears lyons and gyants brazen wals and yron pallizadoes oh how am thundred to death attempt it who will for my part will starve here rather then be earen with bears and lyons and dragons borrible gyants not brother innocentine what sayest thou to these terrible things what art not afraid well have fear enough for you both but good brother speak to which innocentine the younger undauntedly replyed

as am youngest in years so am last in spéech and could wish might be the least but in respect am to make answer to both your demands must a little exercise your patience
tis true the danger is great therefore the more noble but had you my brrethren according to my fathers advice importuned the gods before you had undertaken this great designe questionless the one had not been so filled with

doubts nor the other with feares nor with shame for you both you seem to be as much displeased at my words as am at your actions shall we begin to tyre before we begin to doe for shame let not the world have this advantage of our reputations if we returne home we must expect to undergoe a disgrace worse then death if we dye we dye in high attempts who knows but that the gods may shew extraordinary favours and smile at our designes being we doe it for our dear fathers life if the worst come to the worst we can but dye and we had better doe so then live as if we lived not but perceive my discourse offends will be therefore silent

how philonzo and cruentius hearing the discourse of their younger brother innocentine robb'd him of his treasure and left him bound in a wood where they afterwards lost themselves

cruentius hearing his brothers discourse which was contrary to his expectations told him that he was a very rash boy and understood not what he spoke for sayes he shall we cast away our lives because the world should say we died nobly brother sayes he to philonzo are we bound to be fools because he's mad no let's leave him to his thoughts of honour whilst you and consult what's best to doe so walking a distance from him they sate down and began thus to express themselves

brother philonzo have in this short time both considered the shame and the danger let us endeavour to haste to mesemptronia a city which am sure cannot be farre from this place where we may refresh our selves and have further discourse but what shall we doe replied cruentius with you foolish boy you perceive how refractory and inconsiderate he is and makes sight of that danger which we know to be very great if we leave him questionless he will return home and incense the

king against us what we shall doe in this know not but leave it to your discretion let's force him with us quoth philonzo and make him doe according to our wills if not we will threaten to kill him no quoth cruentius that cannot be for then he will prie into all our actions and make a discovery at out returnes but brother quoth he our bussiness requires haste let us therefore take away his treasure and bind him and so leave him in the wood for it is better one perish then two and if the worst come to the worst that he should be unloosed and returne home we know at our returne how to perswade that what he has related is only lies to disgrace us and by that means to insinuate the more into favour himself and injure us
like this advice well quoth philonzo let us quickly put in execution for the night hastens with that returning to innocentine they asked him what he intended to doe who replied what they did not and so you shall quoth cruentius and so both running together laid hold on him and without hearing him speak bound him and took away his treasure turning his horse loose to range in the woods they departed
thus lay poore innocentine miserably bound insomuch that the swelling of hie hands and féet made him most sadly lament his grievous tortures but philonzo and cruentius having rambled up and down the wood for the space of two hours could by no means finde the way out insomuch that they despaired of travelling any further way out that night but having not rode a further it happened that a dog having lost his master came fawning on cruentius who presently laid hold of him and tying him in a string followed the dog who forthwith brought them out of the wood and presently after to a shéepherds house where the dog found spéedy entertainment but philonzo and cruentius none where we shall for a time leave them and return to innocentine who they left bound in the wood

how innocentine was unbound by an hermit and how afterwards he saved a beautiful lady from ravishment and how the lady requited him

innocentine being fast bound by his unnatural brothers lay till the approach of the evening in a most lamentable condidition till at last a hermit comming from his cell to take the benefit of the coole of the evening heard the sad groanes of poore innocentine and being moved with pity he addressed himself to the place may well say of groans where being come his eye saw what his heart pitied his heart pitied what his hand relieved for he forthwith conducted him to his cell and made such preparations for him as his necessity required so that the next morning he was in a condition to travel but the hermit viewing his guest read in his countenance the characters of a noble and ingenuous disposition observing by his deportment that he was not a man of an ordinary education besides being led by his own inclinations he accosts his stranger in this manner

sir

peive that your youth and education prompts you to bashfulness and your bashfulness hinders the liberty of your spéech therefore htily intreat you to informe me of your present condition and what want in power will supply in prayer for you will not stand to trouble you to relate the misfortunes it is enough and too much that saw them only tell me which way you intend to steere and what you want
innocentine all this while amazed at the courteste of the hermit knew not presently what to answer but as well as his late distemper attended with a multitude of thoughts would permit he thus replied

most charitable father could grieve that was forry for my last misfortune in respect that the happiness of your acquaintance is derived from it will not trouble your patience with the discourse of my misfortune only in short am going upon a designe to save the life of a renowned king but this misfortune hath put me out of a capacitie to follow my intentions come sayes the hermit know your disease i'le be your physition take this cordlal giving him a bag of gold and iewels and returne no complemental answer for am bound to doe it and if you want a stéeed have one for you which this very day stragled hither pray take him and use him as your owne but for this sword which intend for your use pray returne it if you live if not conceale the vertue for it will preserve you against all enchantments which are now very common to my wofull experience neither néed you fear who you encounter with it for you shall not want success
innocentine not a little rejoiced at what the hermit had told him desired liberty to depart in order to which the hermit conducted him to his horse but it fell out that the horse was his owne which he thought his brothers had carried away with them the hermit observing him looke so strictly upon the horse told him that he could not promise him the like service from the horse as he did from the sword no sir quoth innocentine
beléeve am better acquainted with the horse than you for yesterday he was mine till taken from me by misfortune but however cannot but express my hearty thanks you and my returne you shall know more of me in the mean time let peace abide with you let me only beg your ections towards green iveland for am altogether a stranger in these parts your ready way quoth the hermit is to goe to mesemptronis a city about thrée leagues from hence the way is very direct through several villages where you may at your pleasure enquire but there is a forrest which lies betwéen a little town called corumbus and mesemptronia where you must have a careful eye lest you be set upon before you can provide for resistance this is all that can advise you and so farewel

thus they departed and after the expence of some hours innocentine came to the forrest which the hermit told him of where he was no sooner entred but he was welcomed with many loud and lamentable schréekes which strucke him into admiration but being of an undaunted spirit and remembring the sad estate he himself was in the day before resolved to find out the place where he heard this lamentable noise and being more directed by the eare then the eye he at length effected his desires for immediately in a valley he espied two villaines about to ravish a lady of an incomparable beauty and being passionately exasperated he flew upon them like lightning but giving them leave to mount themselves they instead of fight presently run away perceiving it was their brother innocentine perceiving their flight clapt spurres and followed them but the lady perceiving it was fearful that two to one might be very disadvantagious cryed out with what strength she had help help which innocentine hearing fearing some other accident had befallen the lady spéedily returned but when he came he found no such matter but the lady being heartily glad of his returne applied her self to him in this manner

most noble and renowned knight my late fright hath so disordered my thoughts that for the present cannot returne you those thanks which are due to your merits but if you please to adde one favour more to the rest which is to conduct me to my habitation from which place those villaines you saw having surprised me in a solitarie walk dragg'd me you will very much increase my happiness to which request innocentine condescended and in a short time came to the place where he found a welcome entertainment so after many ceremonies past betwéen them the lady requested to know what his name and birth was to which innocentine replied so so much confidence have of your worth that will not kéep the least of my thoughts from you so composting himself he told her his name birth and and likewise told her how his brothers had dealt with him which he was confident

was those which would have ravished her had not he by providence preserved the lady hearing his relation was much astonished but at last recalling her self from her admiration proceeded as followes

most magnanimous and ingenious knight cannot but acknowledge my life and honour to be protected by your vertue shall therefore in part of a requital communicate something to you for your advantage which in short is this not farr from this place there is an enchanted castle kept by two ladies at which castle if you please to goe you shall find civil entertainment from the ladies one of them will much press you to marriage but by no means consent but promise at your returne to give satisfaction to her request tell them likewise that you have a short journey to take but the horse dying in the journey you are now quite destitute then they will presently carrie you into a spacious stable where they will shew you many stéeds and bid you take your choice but refuse them all but one which séems to be the meanest there and they will be very unwilling to lend you him you shall know him by this signe as soone as you come into the stable you shall find him laid and all the rest standing
will not now any longer detaine you leave your horse with me till your returne and you shall accomplish your bustness thus innocentine and the lady parted but we will now leave him and returne to the other brothers which are by this time come to mesemptronia

how philonzo and cruentius came to the shepheards house but could not be entertained and how they lay under an oke that night and the next morning took their journey for mesemptrome

philonzo and cruentius being come to the shepheards house immediately alighted and knockt at the door but the old shepheard and his wife being newly gone to bed were very unwilling to rise at last the shepheard hearing them grow more violent in their knockes arose and looked out of cannot say the window but out of a hole or crannie and asked who was there to which philonzo replied a couple of passengers which had lost their way in a wood and by a dog which they followed were brought thither
the shepheards wife which but a little before was awaked out of her sléep with sighing for the loss of her dog starts out of her bed and cries oh her dear cut and so runs down and lets in her dog and after many expressions of insufferable joy having entertained her dog with many a swéet kisse she went to bed and slept very heartily whilst philonzo and cruentius begg'd very earnestly for entertainment to protect them from a storme which they was hastning upon them but all their intreaties were in vaine for this shepheard told them that he and his were abused not long since by a couple that desired to be entertained as they did and therefore he would not admit them by any means at last when they saw their intreaties were in vaine they departed trusting themselves to the protection of an oke where they had not long reposed but a great tempest of thunder and lightning desiurbed them of their rest so that they forsooke the place as deeming it dangerous to lie there in such tempestuous weather so wandring up and down all night without any rest in the morning they prepared

for their journey and being at last refreshed with the heate of the sunne they spurred heerfully along till they came within view of a not statelie but well scituated house not far from which they espied a beautiful lady walking so solitarie that she hardly tooke notice of her own thoughts philonzo riding towards her and surprising her on a sudden put her into such an amasement that for the present she neither knew what to do or say but philonzo well skill'd in the rudiments of malitious impudence begins to accost her in this manner

madam quoth he very much commend your choice you have chosen a pleasant morning and a sweet air for your private meditations sir replied the lady the walke and air would be more pleasant if you were further from it wonder a knight as you séem to be should be so unadvised or rather uncivil to intrude without notice or acquaintance sir if you are noble shew it by your forbearance to which replied philonzo

madam had you béen less beautiful had béen less ambitious but madam your beautie is the author of my bold intruston but hope you have goodness to pardon as well as have infirmities to offend sir quoth the lady the vanitie of courtship hath taught me to dislike a courtier will therefore leave my walke to your enjoyment
nay quoth philonzo cannot so suddenly dismiss you for your beautie has made a conquest of my heart so either return what your betie has robb'd me of or must be inforced it
sir quoth the lady neither know your intent nor meaning but expect you to be civil therefore pray not my expectations at which words philonzo beckning to his brother cruentine that stood within sight presently with much rigour and incivilitie layd hold on her and dragg'd her into a forrest which was within half a mile being assisted by his brother cruentine need not tell the reader of the many tears the grievous complaints the sundrie prayers this poor distresed lady made to these unhumane villaines but all to no purpose for had not an unexpected knight passed by who

hearing the skreeks of one in distress boldly approached to the place where he found these villaines endeavouring to rob her of her chastitie who they spying perceived him to be their brother which they left bound in the wood ran away and at last arrived at mesemptronia where being come they presently went to their inne and so to rest not the least troubled at their barbarous crueltie the next morning approaching they arose and commanded a plentiful dinner to be provided and that such companie as the city afforded should be invited to keep them companie being strangers at that time to which their host preferring his own gain condescended and forthwith sent for a crew of the most notoriousest cheats the towne could afford who very plausibly treated the new come guests telling them of many courtisans that the city abounded withal which were presently sent for and a great banquet provided to the admiration of the diligently joyful host but after some dayes of their abode they began to féel a consumption in their pockets which caused them to consult of their departure

how innocentine his desire in the inchanted castle with a prom to return how he recovered the golden eagle from the queen of green whose horse was turned into a man who afterwards directed him what to do

after innocentine perceiv'd which steed it was which the lady advised him to request he was very importunate with the ladies to let him have that horse which was laid to which they replyed alas that was the worst in the stable desiring him to make some other choice but he replyed that the other were too good and too lusty for him in respect that he was a very bad horseman
the ladies séeing that he would not be

denyed endeavoured to inchaunt him but their inchantments would not take effect because the sword was his preservative
thus séeing all their labour in vain they made him swear that he would return again and he should have his destres but to be short having swore according to their desires the horse was brought forth he leaping upon him was on a sudden carried to green and in his journey overthrew many knights which waited there on purpose to encounter any that should approach but he with his good sword and steed made slight of them then he approached to the brazen wals where he was welcomed with the roaring of lyons and dragons but as he brandished his sword they fell into a dead sleep then innocentine passed freely not long after he came to a fort that was guarded by gyants who when they perceived his approach presently came running at him with great violence but he no sooner brandished his sword but they fell all a sleep at length having many more difficulties which are now too tedious to relate he came to the place where the quéen and the eagle was the queen and her attendance beholding a stranger so near her presence began to rebuke his insolencie but he brandishing his sword the queen and all her attendants sell asleep insomuch that they could not be waked in the mean time innocentine alighted and took the eagle with no small joy and was departing but his horse would not by any meanes stir a foot from the place which made innocent in a doubt what to do but beholding the incomparable beautie of the queen he drew near and her as she slept after which innocentine cnt off a lock of the quéens haire and left a locke of his in her bosome and then he took a ring of rich value from her finger and put one of his in the same place then finding her picture about her neck he took that off and supplyed the place with his own
having done these things he writes these lines and pinnes them upon the sleve of her garment

renowned queen what here is done was acted by a monarchs sonne but before could depart took your eagle lest my heart accept the change and pardon the abuse virtue whilst you remain will be in use

having thus done he mounts his horse with the eagle in his hand and was immediately brought to the forrest where be preserved the lady from ravishment his stéed making astand at a great river would not go any further notwithstanding innocentine used all the skill he could with switch and spurre but at last his horse spake and bid him forbear and a light innocentine not a little amazed alighted then the horse began to tell him that he must chop off his head and throw it into that river withal bidding him not to be afraid for he intended him no harm but sayes he when you have thrown me in stand with your sword by the river and in what shape soever you sée me appear knock me down again till arise in the shape of a man innocentine being something amazed at this sudden and strange alteration knew not for the present what to do but after a little pause he resolved to do it which being done he threw the head into the river and it rose up the first time like a lion but he presently knockt it down then it rose up in several other shapes but he still kept it down but at last it arose like a tall proper man and then he help it out which being done the man bid him fear nothing but follow his advise and give eare to him whilst he informed him of something which might conduce to his benefit was saith he a knight inchannted in that castle that you had me out of and all those fair stéeds you saw were inchaunted knights am likewise the husband of that lady you preserved from the violence of your brothers which brothers will meet with you before yuu come home with full resolution to kill you but fear not hide the king

and picture which you had of the quéen and desire them not to kill you but tell them you will never discover them to your father then they shall take away your eagle and let you go thus as you have preserved me and mine will preserve you and yours

how philonzo and cruentius obtained a counterfeit eagle in the city of the mesemptronia and returning home met their youger brother innocentine and robb'd him of his eagle and what after happened

philonzo and cruentius having spent most of their money at last agréed with some in the city to get him an eagle which they pretented thy could do which was not long effecting for they got a very great fowle the nearest they could like a eagle and gilded his feathers and brought it to them which they with much joy accepted giving a large summe for it and forthwith departed the city but as they travelled it was their fortune to meet their brother innocentine carrying an eagle in a filver cage at the sight whereof their eagle trembled and dyed but without the least salute to their brother they run upon him and would have killed him but he according to his advise had hid the king and cture in a private place about him which they discovered not but took away cage and eagle with full ent to kill him but he with many passionate expressions diverted their intentions promising them to become their servant and never betray them to his father they hearing these promises saved his life and so he became their servant and they journeyed together at last comming home and carrying their eagle in tritriumph they were joyfully entertained the king embracing the two eldest and commanding the youngest to be immediately put to death for those lies which his brothers had

related of him but innocentine heartilie begg'd of his father that he might not be put to death and so did his brothers séemingly but that he might be made inseriour to the worst servant in the house to which the king though unwilling agréed this was poore innocentine that deserved a just reward cast out of his fathers favour for ever but it happened that not long after the quéen of green ivyland hearing where her eagle was came with a great traine to arigon and presented her self to the king who was absolutelie cured by the vertue of the eagle the queen receiving that vountiful entertainment which her estate required asked the king how many sonnes be had to which the king replied two she desired she might be allowed so great a savour as to sée them immediatelie they appeared so she called philonzo and asked him if he was the man that made so gallant an attempt for her eagle he replied it was his poore endeavour that obtained it pray sayes she let me sée some assurance did you leave me nothing nor take nothing from me no replied philonzo then quoth the quéen you are not the man after him was presented cruentius who the quéen in the like manner gréeted but he replied as philonzo did that he took nothing from her nor left any thing with her
the quéen concealing her anger told the king that these misteries past her imaginations destred the king ingenioustie to tell her if he had no more sonnes kenowned quéen must confess had another sonne which now own not think he may be living amongst the mean servants of my house but for a sonne own him not to which the quéen replied she must needs see him alas replied the king thinke him not worthy of my presence much more of so renowned a quéen as your self but to satisste your requests he shall be called in the mean time the king departed whilst innocentine approached the quéens presence to whom the quéen discourst as followes

are you the youngest son of this koyal king or no he replied with a blushing countenance no what are you his servant he replied no friend you speake very misteriously

discover they self then know incomparable lady that my father being incens'd against me condemned me to dye but by the request of my brothers was preserved and became a servant to the worst of my fathers servants contenting my self with these poor babilliments which indéed were they as rich as could be imagined were too mean to be presented before so worthy a person as madam you are and for my self
could tremble into ashes at the sight of so excellent a creature as your vertuous self but shall remove so unworthy an object from your fight and crave license to depart no replied the quéen you shall not have a few questions to aske you my rudeness most unparalled lady shall be as obedient to reply as your grace shall be ready to demand although am unworthy to be the least of your creatures
the quéen hearing him express himself with so much humilitie and excellencie of spéech the king forgetting that his son was there came suddenlie into the presence of the quéen and beholding his started backe the quéen perceiving it desired the king to yield her so great a favour as to stay to hear her aske his son two or thrée questions the king not using to deny the request of such persons sate down whilst the quéen thus exprest her self to innocentine was it you that took my eagle from me pray answer me without ceremonie to which he vowing himself replied madam did and what token left you with me or took from me madam a lock of your hair where is it replied the quéen next my heart madam replyed innocentine and here it is but what leave me said the quéen a lock of mine replied innocentine great prince said the quéen to the king and here it is but pray let your patience expect my further discourse with him come hither said the quéen to vashful innocentine doe you know this picture and this king yes madam and hope your greatness knows these shewing her the picture and the king which he had took from her come saies the quéen give me the picture and instead of the shadow take the substance am resolved renowned king not to depart till have made him possessor

a preface concerning the apostasie of the now church of rome

this ensuing treatise as it cleareth the doctrine of the gospell in that high point concerning our title to the kingdome of heaven so it helpeth to discover the apostasie of the now church of rome from the faith
for though the papists doe vaunt that their church meaning especially the see of rome is so farre from falling away from the faith that it cannot fall into errours in matters of faith yet they cannot deny but that in the latter times

and namely in the time of antichrist there should be a great defection from the faith and as it were a catholike apostasie whereof antichrist was to bee the head
of this apostasie the holy ghost hath prophesied in divers places of the scriptures as tim

whereby it is evident that the new church of rome hath made this apostasie
now let us consider in what respects the church of rome is revolted from the faith
by faith in this question we understand not the habit or grace of faith but the doctrine of faith non id quo creditur

not that by which we beleeve sed illud quod creditur bu that which we doe beleeve
in which sense the word faith is often used both in the scriptures and also in the monuments of ecclesiasticall writers
now the doctrine of faith is either generall or speciall
the generall are the whole canonicall scriptures or the written word of god in generall which is objectum

fidei adaequatum the even object the rule and foundation of faith so that whatsoever doctrine is contained in the scriptures either expressely or by necessary consequence is to bee received as a doctrine of faith and whatsoever is not so contained in the scriptures is not dogma fidei

from the holy scriptures which god hath propounded to be the only rule of faith they are revolted unto the doctrines devices of men by changing the rule of faith which they have done divers wayes
for first whereas the rule the foundation and chiefe principle of faith whereinto it is last resolved is the authority of god speaking in the holy scriptures they have set up another rule which is the authority of the romane church and therein of the pope which they make the superiour

rule from which the authority of the scriptures themselves dependeth and into which their faith is last resolved
for the pope is as they say virtually the church and what they say in this kinde to magnifie the authority of the church is specially to bee under stood of the pope who onely for sooth hath an infallible judgement and not subject to errour for if you will beleeve them a generall or oecumenicall councell without the pope may erre but the pope alone without a councell cannot erre yea the authority of the pope and councell together is no greater than the authority of the pope alone from whom all councels have their authority for ab arbi pontificis tota

conciliorum authoritas pendet quae tantam habent quantam papa indulget and thus bellarmine

denieth this assertion aliquid majus est concilium cum pontifice quam pontifex solus
if therefore the authoritie of the church be greater than that of the scriptures as they teach and if the authority of the pope be absolutely above the church universall as

they also teach then much more is the authoritie of the pope above the scriptures
now whosoever taketh upon him authority above the scriptures which are the undoubted word of god hee is undoubtedly antichrist whose judgement to make as the papists plainely doe the chiefe principle of faith into which their faith is last resolved is no better thn to revoli from christ to antichrist

secondly they change the rule of faith by making their traditions that is such doctrines and observations as are taught and observed in the church of rome having no ground nor warrant in the holy scriptures to bee the word of god the word unwritten and a rule of faith which also they doe not only match with the holy scriptures but even in many respects preferre before

them and acknowledge them to bee the more

entire and perfect rule of faith

thirdly they have changed the rule of faith by making those bookes canonicall which all antiquity almost yea and all succeeding ages untill the councell of trent following therein the judgement of hierome did hold apochryphall or at the most but eeclesiasticall which might bee read in the church for morall instruction but not as rules of faith
fourthly they change the rule of faith when in stead of the originall text of the old and new testaments which were penned by the prophets and apostles themselves they make a corrupt and that sometimes a barbarous translation of know not whom to be the authentike text and the rule of faith preferring the vulgar latine translation before the originall text which the penmen of the holy ghost did write

fifthly they change the rule of faith when in stead the true sense and maning of the holy scriptures expounded by the scriptures according to the analoge of faith they obtrude the sense given by the church of rome and therein by the pope who is as they say the supreme and onely authenticall interpreter of the word from whom it is not lawfull to dissent so that in his sense any portion of the scriptures though obscure must bee acknowledged the word of god but urged in any other sense it is the word

of the devill rather than the word of god
now it is the sense of the scriptures which is the word of god rather than the letter the sense being the soule and life of the letter
non enim in legendo scripturae sed in intelligendo consistunt saith hierome

the words saith bellarmine

are as the sheath the sense is the sword of the spirit

thus hath the church of rome revolted from the generall doctrine of faith which is the written word of god or the holy canonicall scriptures
the speciall doctrines of faith are the severall articles taught in the scriptures which are the speciall objects of faith either quae justificat onely or qua justificat
the justifying faith beleeh all the articles and doctrines of faith which are taught in the word of god but the peculiar object of faith quatenus justificat is the doctrine of the gospell
as touching the speciall doctrines of christian faith there are divers bundreds of errors wherein the church of rome hath revolted from the faith not at once but at dives times and by degrees
the number whereof is so great as that popery or the catholicisme of papits may justly bee called the catholike apostasie

but from the peculiar doctrine of faith quatenus justificat which is the doctrine of the gospell concerning justification by faith in christ alone the church of rome chiefly erreth as have shewed in this treatise and by their antichristian doctrine in this point they are revolted from the gospell which is

verbum fidei the word or doctrine of faith they are fallen from the comfortable doctrine of this grace and to them christ is made of none effect as have

proved

this assertion concerning the apostsie of the now church of rome ppose as an antidote against the poison of their impudently depraved article concerning the catholike church wherein there is a double imposture or poyso both in respect of the object and also of the act of faith which two in every article of the creed are to be considered
for first in respect of the object whereas the apostles creed hath the holy catholike church they understand the catholike romane

church the mother for soth and mistresse of all churches which they call atholike not as it is one particular church as every orthodox church was wont to bee called as the catholike church of

smyrna but as it comprehendeth all particular churches which live in communion with and in subjection to the see of rome all which are as they say but one church because they are subject to one visible head the pope of rome
and they adde that out of this communion with the see of rome and without this subjection to the pope of rome as the universall bishop there is no salvation
with this one nt they those seduced soules which either they draw to their side or detaine in communion with them
howheit it is a most shamelesse imposture

for first can it bee imagined that the apostles by catholike understood the romane church which when they composed the creede was not extant nor for divers yeeres after
no doubt the apostles meant that church which then had a being and whereof themselves were members which also had been from the beginning of the world and was to continue for ever viz the universall company of the elect and that is the meaning of the word catholike

secondly for the first sixe hundred yeares the bishop of rome did not challenge unto himslse the title or authority of universall bishop but was onely the archbishop or patriarch of rome unto whom the foure other patriarches of constantinople alexandria antioch and ierusalem were no more subject than hee to them every one of them having the primacy within their severall patriarchicall jurisdictions
and although after the grant of the tyrant phocas in the yeare sixe hundred seven the pope challenged for himselfe to be the universall bishop and for his see to be the head of all churches yet by the greeke and other churches which were and are the better and greater part of christendome this claime never was nor is at this day acknowledged
all which churches notwithstanding wherein were innumerable saints and martyrs and the most holy fathes of the church by this romish article are most wicedly and schimatically excluded from salvation because they acknowledged no subjection to the see of rome
but if the now church of rome be the apostaticall church having revolted from the ancient religion of christians by their idlatry and supersition and from the ancien faith of christians contained generally in the holy canonicall scriptures and more particularly in the gospell as by other almost innumerable errours of popery so more especially by those which confute in this booke and if the head of this catholike apostasie that is to say the pope be antichrist then let all christians who have any care of their soules consider whether it bee safe for them to live in the communion of that sect and in subjection to that see where they must have the apostaticall church even the whore of babylon to be their mother from whom they are commanded to separate apoc

and the antichrist to be their father their head their universall bishop who prevaileth in them onely that perish thes



as touching the act of faith their coozenage in respect thereof is worse if worse may be
for where the apostles creed hath credo sanctam ecclesiam catholicam they understand this article as if the words were not credo ecclesiam beleeve that there is a catholike church and that there is a communion of saints the members of that church but credo ecclesiae or in ecclesiam give credit to the church or beleeve in the church making the church whereby they understand the now church of rome not onely the materiall but also formall object of faith in which they beleeve and for which they beleeve whatsoever it beleeveth or propoundeth to be beleeved
and in this exposition they are growne so impudent as that they say

that the church catholike meaning the now romane church is the very principle of our faith for which we are to beleeve the holy scriptures and all other articles that it is the chiefe priciple wheron the authority of the scriptures dependeth and the last principle into which their faith is to bee resolved that

in this article is summarily contained the whole word of god not onely written but

also unwritten that christ propounded unto us the whole word of god when he commanded us to heare the church mat

luk

and which surpasseth all impudencie that the fathers

sometimes in this sence do say that all the doctrines of faith are contained in the holy scriptures to wit as in a generall principle quatenus illae monent credendum esse ecclesiae in that they admonish that the church is to be bleeved in all things
and further that the implicite faith which is implied in this one article beleeve the romane church and whtsoever that church beleeveth or propoundeth to be beleeved is the most

entire faith and most safe not onely for the lay people though they know or beleeve no more but also for the learned
for whom it is not so safe when satan contendeth with them to defend their faith by the scriptures as to professe onely that they beleeve as the church beleeveth

but indeed this implicite faith whereby men doe beleeve or professe themselves to beleeve as the church of rome and therein the pope beleeveth or propoundeth to be beleevd acknowledging him to be the principle yea the chiefe and last principle into which there is ultima resolutio fidei upon which the authority of the scriptures dependeth is to take upon them the very marke of the beast

and to revolt from christ to antichrist which is the miserable condition of all resolute papists
for antichrist prevaileth in them only that perish whose names are not written in the booke of life

let not therefore the popish priests and iesuits the emissaries of antichrist like egregious imposters terrifie any longer the people with these that there is no salvation but in the communion with the church of rome and in subjection under the pope untill they have proved which they will never be able to doe that their church is not apostaticall and that their pope who is the head of the catholike apostasie is not as about twelve yeeres ago proved him to be antichrist
to conclude let the popish rabbins either vindicate their church from apostasie and their pope from antichristianisme or else for ever hereafter hold their peace

a treatise of ivstification
the first booke wherein is set downe the true doctrine of justification according to the word of god
cap
the excellencie of this argument is set forth and the definition of justification propounded and in part expounded



among all the articles of christian religion there

is none as suppose either more necessarie to be knowne or more comfortable to be beleeved than the doctrine of justification whereby a faithfull man is taught to beleeve and know that hee being a sinner in himselfe and by sinne obnoxious to eternall damnation is by the mercies of god and merits of christ through faith not onely freed from the guilt of his sinnes and from everlasting damnation but also accepted as righteous before god in christ and made heire of eternall life
this doctrine in many places of the scripture

hereafter· to be cited is undefined span alphabet by way of excellency called the truth

and sometimes the truth of the gospell

as gal


that is the truth of god revealed in the gospell concerning justification and salvation by the free grace of god through the merits of christ apprehended by faith being also the chiefe argument contained in the gospell which is therefore called the power of

god unto salvation because therein the righteousnesse of god even that by which we are justified and saved is revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live

by faith or he that is just by faith shall live which doctrine is so inviolably and incorruptly to be held

that if an apostle if an angell from heaven shall teach any other gospell that is any other doctrine whereby to bee justified and saved than by the onely merits of christ apprehended by faith hee ought to bee held accursed
but by how much the more necessary and comfortable this doctrine is by so much the more it is oppugned by satan who as at the first hee did not abide in the truth

nor kept his first estate but left his habitation rather

than hee would as some probably thinke embrace this truth namely that the second person in trinity should for the salvation of mankinde become flesh and that in him the nature of man should be advanced above the nature of angels so hath hee ever since opposed it by all meanes as namely by raising not only other false teachers in the apostles times and since but even antichrist and his adherents in these later times who have not onely perverted this doctrine but also subverted it and have as it were taken away the subject of the question for by confounding the law and the gospell the covenant of workes and the covenant of grace the benefits of justification and sanctification and of two making but one they have wholly abolished that great benefit of the messias about our justification whereby wee are freed from hell and entituled to the kingdome of heaven and consequently they are fallen

from grace having disanulled

the covenant of grace and made the promise of none effect
for whosoever seeketh to be justified by inherent

righteousnesse he is under

the curse he is a debtour

to the whole law and therefore to him christ is become of none

effect
this being therefore a controversie of such importance that it concerneth our very title to the kingdome of heaven it is to bee handled with all diligence and not without invocation of the holy spirit of truth whom wee beseech to guide and to direct us in setting downe the truth to confirme and stablish us in the profession of it and to assist and strengthen us against the enemies thereof
but before come to confute the errours of the papists the enemies of the truth will first set downe the true doctrine of justification according to gods word


ii
iustification therefore is a most gracious and righteous action of

god whereby he imputing the righteousnesse of christ to a beleeving sinner absolveth him from his sinnes and accepteth· of him as righteous in christ and as heire of eternall life to the praise and glory of his owne mercy and justice
where first consider the name of the thing which wee have

now defined and are hereafter to handle
to justifie if you respect the

notation of the latine word signifieth to make just as to magnifie importeth to make great
neither is it to be doubted but that the lord whom he justifieth doth constitute or make just
now the lord maketh men just two wayes either by imputation of christs righteousnesse which is out of them in christ as being his personall righteousnesse or by infusion of righteousnesse as it were by influence into them from christ their head
to the faithfull therefore there belongeth

a twofold righteousnesse the one of justification the other of sanctification
the former is the righteousnesse of christ and therefore the righteousnesse of god as it is often called the righteousnesse of god because it is the righteousnesse of him that is god and is imputed to the beleever the later is ours because inherent in us though received from god as all our good things are
the former is perfect as being the righteousnesse of him that is god the later is but begun in this life and is to be perfected in the life to come
by the former we are justified by the later we are sanctified
if it be objected that there seemeth little or no difference betweene these two words for as to justifie is to make just so to sanctifie is to make holy
and therefore as to sanctifie is to make holy by holinesse infused so to justifie is to make just by justice inherent

answer first that this is contrary to the use of the word justifie· not onely pepetuall in the scriptures but also ordinary in the speeches and writings of men
wherein god is said to justifie men and man is said to justifie god and one man is said to justifie another and one and the same man to justifie himselfe without any signification of infusing righteousnesse into him but by cleering him and pronouncing him just
secondly that there is no further respect to be had in this controversie to the notation of the latine or english word than as it is a true translation of the hebrew word in the old testament and of the greek in the new now shall make it evident

that the hebrew hitsdiq and so the greeke undefined span alphabet is verbum forens a judiciall word taken from the courts of justice· which being attributed to the iudge is opposed to condemning and signifieth to absolve or to give sentence with the party questioned


iii
in the definition we consider justification as an action of

god whose alone worke it is and so the scriptures consider it in many places as rom

it is god that doth justifie for it is he only that forgiveth sinnes esa

it is he onely that can by making us righteous in christ give us right and title to the kingdome of heaven
it is no action therefore of our owne or of any creature neither is it wrought by our owne preparations and dispositions
for although every man is bound to use all meanes to attaine to justification yet it is not of him that willeth

nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy
for if god bee the agent in justifying us then are wee the patients
and for that cause we are never in the scriptures exhorted to justification or to the parts thereof which are not our officia or duties but gods beneficia as wee are to the duties of sanctification whereunto we being already justified and regenerated doe cooperate with the spirt of grace


iiii
secondly when we say it is an action of god imputing

the righteousnesse of christ and absolving the beleeving sinner and accepting him wee consider it not as an action of god within us working a positive or reall change as in sanctification but as an action of god without us
for it is a judiciall act of god as the iudge oppoed to

condemning
and therefore as by his sentence hee doth condemne that is make wicked so by his sentence hee doth justifie that is of guilty he maketh not guilty undefined span alphabet by his sentence god doth justifie as chrysostome and oecumenius note upon rom

where a judiciall proceeding in the businesse of justification is plainely described
for there is mention of the accuser of gods elect there is god that justifieth and none to condemne there is the advocate and intercessor

to plead for us
and as in condemning though the hebrew word hirshiah opposed to justifying signifieth to make wicked for as tsady is to be just and hitsdiq to make just that is to justifie so rashah to be wicked and hirshiah to make wicked that is to condemne yet god by condemning doth not make a reall or positive change by infusion of wickednesse into the party whom by his sentence hee maketh wicked that is condemneth so in justifying though the word doe signifie to make righteous yet the lord doth not quatenus justificat as he justifieth worke a reall or positive mutation in the party whom by his sentence he maketh just that is justifieth in respect of any inward dispositions or qualities but onely a relative change or mutation in respect of his estate and condition before god and in respect of some relations to him
it is true hat in our justification we are of sinners made righteous but the righteousnesse which we have by justification standeth in remission of sinne and acceptation or constitution of us as righteous not in our selves but in christ both which are wrought by imputation of his righteousnesse
it is true also that whom god doth justifie he doth also sanctifie
but in justification he doth not worke a reall change in the party as he doth in sanctification
and this in the like actions of god viz adoption redemption and reconciliation which three in substance differ not from justification
for all agree in the not imputing of sinne

by imputation of christs righteousnesse but are diversified by certaine relations all which concurre in justification that men having their sinnes forgiven whereby they had beene either the children of the devill by adoption are made the sonnes of god or the vassals and bondslaves of sinne and satan are by redemption made the servants of god or enemies to god by their reconciliation become his favourites or guilty of sinne and damnation in their justification they are accepted as righteous in christ· and consequently become gods servants gods favourites gods sonnes and if sonnes then also heires of eternall life
as therefore in adoption redemption reconciliation there is no reall change made in the party but onely a new relation acquired of being a sonne and hire to the adoptour a servant to the redeemer a favourite to the reconciler which before he was not so neither in justification is there a reall or positive change as the papists would have it but undefined span alphabet relative or undefined span alphabet that is in relation in respect of those relations even now mentioned and in respect of his estat and condition before god being in his justification translated from the estate of damnation unto the state of salvation
even as the councell of trent it selfe defineth

justification to be a translation from that state

wherein a man is borne the sonne of the first adam into a state of grace and adoption of gods sonnes through the second adam iesus christ our saviour which is done without any reall change wrought in the party as hee is justified
for who before was guilty of sinne and damnation the same man remaining a sinner in himselfe and in himselfe worthy of damnation is in his justification absolved from the guilt of sinne and accepted as rteous in christ in whom also hee is made a servant a favourite a sonne of god and consequently as said in the definition an heire of eternall life



and yet we deny not but that those whom god reconcileth

unto himselfe receiving them into his grace and avour in christ them also he endueth in some measure with the graces of his spirit whom he adopteth to be his sonnes in christ them also he regenerateth by his holy spirit whom he redeemeth from the guilt of sinne he also freeth from the dominion of sinne and whom he justifieth by faith he also sanctifieth by his spirit that is whom he maketh just by imputation them also he maketh just by infusion of righteousnesse to whom he imputeth the merit of christ his death and resurrection apprehended by faith to them also he applieth the vertue and efficacie of christs death and resurrection both to mortifie sinne in them and to raise them up to newnesse of life
by this doctrine we may trie our selves whether we be reconciled redeemed adopted justified
for hereby it shall appeare that god hath received us into his grace if he hath also endued us with his grace
chasidim as they are called in the scriptures the favourites of god are usually translated his holy ones and all the faithfull even in this life are termed saints
hereby it will appeare that we are redeemed from the guilt of sinne if we be also freed from the dominion of sinne
hereby it will appeare that we are adopted if be also regeneratech hereby it will appeare that we are justified if we also in some measure sanctified
but yet howsoever these graces waies goe together and cannot be severed yet must we carefully distinguish betwixt the grace of god which is in himselfe and his graces which are in us betwixt the actions of gods grace without us and the actions of his grace within us
wherefore though adoption and regeneration though receiving into grace and enduing with grace though redeeming from the guilt and purging in some measure from the corruption of sinne though justification and sanctification are alwaies unseparable companions yet we may not with the papists confound them and so place the matter of justification and merit of salvation in our selves as they wickedly doe but we are religiously to distinguish them as they are in themselves truly and really distinguished to the praise of the glory that is the glorious praise of his grace not of that which is in us but of that which is in himselfe whereby he hath graciously accepted us in his beloved ephes




vi thirdly when we say it is an action of god imputing to a beleeving

sinner
we consider it not as a suddaine and momentany action which is of no continuance as if all our sinnes both past present

and to come are remitted in an instant but as an act of god continued from our vocation wherein the grace of faith is begotten in us to our glorification which is the end of our faith
for as this action of god is called the justification of a sinner so whiles we continue sinners we have still need to be justified
and as we alwaies have sinne in this life so that it may not be imputed we have need that christs righteousnesse should be imputed unto us and that as we sinne daily so christ our advocate should continually make

intercession for us that notwithstanding our manifold slippes whereinto through humane frailety we fall and notwithstanding those manifold infirmities and corruptions which remaine in us as the relikes of originall sinne we may be continued in the grace and favour of god by the continued imputation of christs righteousnesse obtained by his continuall intercession for us
for therefore doth he continue his intercession for us that our justification may bee continued to us and that as wee sinne daily so wee may daily seeke and obtaine pardon
but if justification should so be wrought once and at once as that after that act wrought in an instance we should no more be justified nor no more neede remission of sinne then must we erroniously conceive that the sinnes which after the first moment of our justification we doe commit are actually remitted before they bee committed whereas god forgiveth onely sinnes past rom

so shall we not onely set open a gap to all licentiousnesse

for who will so feare to commit sinne as he ought or when he hath committed it so sue for the pardon thereof who is perswaded beforehand that it is already remitted but also shall open the mouthes of our adversaries who will be ready to say that we protestants ought not to pray for remission of sinne because in our opinion as they say we need it not but to this calumniation of the papist have elsewhere

answered


vii
if it be said that it is a received opinion among many that justificatio simul semel fit that justification is wrought at once and but once answere that that assertion is not to be admitted without distinction nor without good caution
the distinction is this that there is a justification of a sinner before god in coelesti which properly is called justification and is that which here have defined and there is a justification whereby a man already justified before god is justified in foro conscienti in the court of his owne conscience which is not properly justification it selfe but the assurance of it
to this latter that assertion of but once and at once cannot in any good sense be applied
for neither is the full assurance of our justification attained at once but by degrees wherein we are to labour and to give diligence to make as our election and calling so also our justification more and more sure unto us
neither is it given but once
for by committing of any crime or any grievous sinne by spirituall desertions by the orcible temptations of satan this act of spirituall faith which we call assurance may be interrupted or lost for a time and yet by repentance by prayer and practise of pietie it may be recovered againe

and therefore not given but once
to the former indeed it may be applied in both parts but with a twofold caution first in respect of simul at once if it be understood as excluding degrees and not continuance
namely that we are not justified by degrees and as it were by little and little as though our justification were not perfect at the first
for no sooner doth a man truly beleeve in christ but the righteousnesse of christ is imputed to him and in and by that righteousnesse he standeth righteous before god as well at the first as at the last that righteousnesse of christ by which he is justified whether first or last being most perfect
therefore the righteousnesse of justification cannot be increased neither doth our justification before god admit degrees either in one and the same person or yet in diverse men howsoever the assurance of justification and the worke of sanctification whereby we are to be renewed in the inner

man day by day have degrees according to the degrees of our faith and according to the measure of grace received
secondly when it is said that we are justified before god semel but once that also may be admitted if by once be meant one continuall act
for as we are regenerated but once because ut semel nascimur ita semel renascimur so faith which is wrought in our regeneration is given but once
for that which saint iude saith verse
of faith once given is no lesse true of the habit than of the doctrine of faith which habit being once had is never utterly lost
for all they who have true faith are borne of god iohn

iohn

and those

who are once borne of god are never unborne againe but being made sonnes by faith as all the faithfull are gal


they are also made

heires of god and coheires with christ rom

as faith therefore is never utterly lost no more is justification
for so long as wee have faith so long wee are justified
but the habit of faith wee never lose though perhaps some act of faith may sometimes bee interrupted
therefore our justification is but one continued act and in that sense we are justified but once


viii
now whereas we have defined and defended according

to the scriptures that justification is an action of god and such an action as is without us and a continued act hence we may conclude against the papists first that neither their first nor second justification is that justification which is taught in the scriptures
not the second for that is not gods action but their owne who being justified before by habituall righteousnesse infused from god doe themselves as they each by practising of good workes increase their righteousnesse that is justifie themselves by actuall righteousnesse as the merit of their second justification
not that wee deny that inherent righteousnesse is by practise of good workes increased but that wee hold that justification is not our owne act neither that we are justified by any righteousnesse inherent in our selves or performed by our selves nor that the righteousnesse of justification which is indeed the righteousnesse of christ can be increased and therefore no degrees of justification

not the first which they make to bee an action of god within us working in us a reall change or positive mutation by infusion of the habits of grace and specially of charitie and confound it with habituall sanctification from which notwithstanding it is necessarily to be distinguished

secondly justification being an action of god is not to bee confounded with justification passively understood and much lesse with justice it selfe
but the papists not onely understand it passively but also confound it with inherent iustice
thirdly they doe not hold justification to bee one continued act from our vocation to our glorification
but such an act as may not onely be interrupted ostentimes and lost for a time as they say it is by every mortall sinne and againe be renewed so oft as they goe to shrift but also that it may totally and finally bee lost
which error have confuted at large in my treatise of perseverance

cap ii
the efficient causes of iustification


but in this definition besides the genus not onely all the

causes of iustification but also the essentiall parts thereof are briefly comprised which will now distinctly propound
the causes because in the knowledge of them standeth the science of every thing the essentiall parts because in them justification it selfe consisteth
the causes of justification as of all other things are foure the efficient the matter the forme the end

the efficiet causes are of two sorts either principall or instrumentall
the principall is god which noted in the definition when said

it is an action of god
for it is god that justifieth as the scriptures in many places doe testifie as namely rom






gal


god say the father the sonne and the holy ghost
for it being an outward action of god or as the schoolemen speake ad extra respecting the creatures it is the common action of the whole trinity
and thus god alone as the iudge doth justifie
for he alone is the lawgiver

who hath power over our soules against whom wee sinne

and by our sinne become his debtours when we transgresse his law
and therefore he alone properly forgiveth sinnes as himselfe professeth esay

and as the scribes and pharisees confesse as a received

truth luk

for who may take upon him to remit those debts which wee owe to god it is he who reconcileth us unto himselfe in christ not imputing our sinnes cor

and accepting of us in his

beloved ephes


it is he alone that forgiving our sinnes freeth us from hell and giveth us right to his heavely kingdome
which doctrine

serveth first for our direction and instruction where to seeke and to sue for justification and remission of sinnes
not to any creature but to god alone in the name

and mediation of christ to whom alone our saviour directeth us

to sue for pardon
secondly it ministreth strong consolation to all the faithfull
for seeing it is god that justifieth them

who shall lay any thing to their charge who shall condemne thirdly it srveth for the confutation or rather condemnation of the pope and all popish priests who take upon them power not as ministers of the gospell to declare and pronounce remission of sinnes but as iudges to remit them it being a proper attribute of god exod


which he appropriateth to himselfe esay

and which no meere

man can without blasphemy arrogate to himselfe mark




ii
with the principall cause we are to joyne the consideration

of the motives or moving causes both without god which of some are called undefined span alphabet and also within himselfe which are called undefined span alphabet which are indeed principia agendi
the former are mans misery which though it be not properly a cause but the object of mercy yet is said to bee a motive and is used as a reason to move to mercy

and thence misericordia hath its name and christs merits which properly are the procatarcticke cause of our justification besides which there is no other merit
the moving causes within god are his mercy and his iustice which signified in the definition when said that justification is a most grcious and right action os god
for as in many if not in all the workes of god his mercy and justice meet together so especially in the worke of our iustification and redemption which cardinall cjetan well observed the holy scripture saith he doth not say that we are justified by grace alone but by grace and justice together but both of god that is by the grace of god and by the justice of god and not by the righteousnesse of men
by grace understand the gracious love and favour of god in christ vouchsafed unto us in him before all secular times tim


in which he hath graciously accepted us in his beloved by which

as we are elected and called and shall be saved so by the same we are justified and that freely without any cause in us rom

now the lord is said to justifie us by his grace first because of his hee gave his owne sonne to bee our righteousnesse
secondly because of his owne free grace he hath given us those meanes whereby the righteousnesse

of christ might bee communicated unto us as namely the ministery of the word and of the sacraments
thirdly because of his grace hee blesseth those meanes unto us working and encreasing in us the grace of faith by which we are justified and lasly when we doe by faith

which is his gift bleeve hee freely imputth unto us the righteousnesse of christ accepteth of us in him and in him adopteth us to be his sonnes and heires of eternall life


iii
but as the lord is gracious in justifying a beleeving sinner so hee is also righteous rom

for threfore hath the lord set

forth his sonne and our saviour to bee a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousnesse through the remission of sinnes that are past by the forbearance of god to declare say at this time his righteousnesse that he might be just and the iustifier of him which beleeveth in iesus
for such is the righteousnesse of god that hee forgiveth no mans sinne for which his iustice is not fully satisfied by christ neither doth hee accept of any as just but such as by imputation of christs righteousnesse are made just in him
the consideration of this justice of god in forgiving sinnes doth afford singular comfort to the faithfull
for seeing the lord forgiveth no sinne for which his justice is not satisfied and seeing our saviour hath fully satisfied the justice of his father for the sinnes of all that beleeve in him from hence we may be assured that as there is no condemnation to them that are in christ iesus so no punishment properly so called that is such a penalty as is inflicted in ordine justitiae and by way of vengeance because it cannot stand with the justice of god to punish the second time those sinnes in us for which his justice is already fully satisfied in christ


iv
but the actions of god the principall efficient of justification are to bee distinguished according to the distinction of the three persons
for god the father justifieth as the primary cause and authour the sonne as the meritorious cause the holy ghost as the cause applicatory that is to say god the father through the sonne doth justifie

us by the holy ghost
the father say as primary cause and that in two respects first in that hee gave his onely begotten sonne for us and set him forth to be a through fith in his blood that all who beleeve in him should bee iustified rom

ioh


secondly as the iudge in absolving those that beleeve and pronouncing them just in christ
the sonne as the mediatour and meritorious

cause and that also in two respects
first as he is our surety who paid our debt and our redeemer who laid downe the price of our redemption for us esay

affording unto us the matter and merit of

our justification
secondly as hee is our intercessour and advocate to plead for us that his merits may be imputed to us rom

ioh


heb



god the father therefore justifieth as the primary cause per authoritatem as the schoolemen speake the sonne as the secondary

cause per ministerium
for so it is said esa

my righteous servant shall justifie many
the father as the iudge the sonne as the mediator and advocate
the father as the creditour accepting christs satisfaction for us the sonne as the surety paying our debt for us
but howsoever god the father hath given his sone and the sonne hath given himselfe for us and hath paid that price and performed that obedience which is sufficient for our justification notwithstanding none are actually justified by the merits of christ but they onely to whom they are applyed
for although the sufferings of christ be a precious salve to cure our soules yet they will not heale us unlesse they bee applyed
and although his righteousnesse bee as a wedding garment to cover our nakednesse yet it will not cover us unlesse it bee

put on
in the third place therefore the holy ghost may also be said to

justifie us because hee doth apply unto us christs merits unto our justification both as he is the spirit of regeneration working in us the grace of faith by which we receive christ unto our justification in foro coelesti and also as hee is the spirit of adoption confirming our faith and working in us the assurance of our justification by which wee are justified in foro conscientiae



now the meanes of this application are instrumentall causes

of our justification and doe justifie instrumentally
and these are of two sorts viz on gods part and on ours
for to effect this application there must bee manus dei offerentis the hand of god offering and manus accipientis the hand of the receiver
the instruments on gods part are the ministery of the word and sacraments whereby the holy ghost doth beget and confirme faith in us
in respect whereof ministers

are said to justifie men dan


for as touching the ministery of the gospell first in it the benefit of the messias as namely reconciliation adoption and justification is revealed and offered to all that shall beleeve and by it wee are stirred up to receive and embrace it
in which respect the preaching of the gospell is called the ministery of reconciliation and the ministers are gods embassadours sent to entreat men in gods name and in christs stead that they would be reconciled

unto god cor

secondly the holy ghost having thus by the ministery of the gospell knocked at the doore of mens hearts in his good time maketh it effectuall opening their hearts

to give a lively and effectuall assent to the gospell whereby they receiving christ and beleeving in him are justified
thus faith commeth by hearing

the word
and in this respect preachers of the gospell are said to be the

ministers by whom men doe beleeve cor

thirdly in the preaching of the gospell seconded and made powerfull by the operation of the holy ghost the sentence of justification and remission of finnes and consequently of salvation is pronounced and concluded in the conscience of the faithfull when as out of the generall promise of the gospell whosoever truely beleveth in christ hath remission of sinnes being by the minister conditionally applyed to the hearer and absolutely assumed by the beleever after this manner if thou saith the minister doest truely beleeve in christ thou hast remission of sinnes and thou

shalt be saved rom

but saith the faithfull hearer doe truely beleeve in christ my conscience bearing mee witnesse in the holy ghost this conclusion is inferred as the verdict of the holy ghost testifying with the conscience of the faithfull in the assumption according to gods word contained in the proposition therefore have remission of sinnes therefore shall be saved
and in this sense ministers are said to remit sinnes ioh

and consequently to justifie when they

doe pronounce remission of sinnes to them that beleeve and repent
and whatsoever they doe in this behalfe upon earth according to the word is ratified in heaven


vi
as touching the sacraments in them first the benefit of the

messias is represented before our eyes by the outward signes whereupon the sacrament is called verbum visibile
secondly such is the sacramentall union betweene the signe and the thing signified that together with the signe the thing signified that is christ with all his merits is offered in the lawfull use of the sacrament
thirdly the benefit of the messias is not only offered in the lawfull use together with the signe but also conferd and given to every faithfull and worthy receiver
and hereof the sacrament is a pledge given to the beleever to assure him that as the minister doth give unto him the signe so the lord doth give unto him the thing signified
and in this sense every sacrament is a seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith rom

annexed to

the promise of the gospell which by delivery of the sacrament is particularly applyed to every faithfull receiver to assure him in particular of his justification and salvation by christ
thus the ministery of the gospell is the meanes to beget faith and the sacraments the instruments to confirme the same
but the papists deny both for that faith is begotten in the ministery of the word and that so men attaine to remission of sinnes and justification they say it is a fiction of the heretikes of these times
neither doe they grant that sacraments are seales of righteousnesse or that they were ordained to seale the promises unto us
but they hold them to bee such effectuall instruments as doe by vertue inherent in themselves conferre justifying grace which they call gratiam gratum facientem ex opere operat
by which doctrine a they have turned religion into a meere outward formality according to the prophecy of them tim


ascribing all the degrees of salvation to

be atchieved in this life viz
vocation iustification sanctification to the externall use of the sacraments so they have made their doctrine of justification to bee an idle speculation whereof in their practice there is little or no use
for to what purpose doe they dispute of justification by vertuous preparations and gracious dispositions when they teach that the sacraments doe ex opere operato that is by the very performance of the outward act justifie the receiver requiring in him neither any vertuous preparation or gracious disposition for without them hee is justified
onely this caution they doe interpose that hee doe not ponere obicem mortalis peccati that hee put not the obstacle of mortall sinne
for if those things should necessarily be required then the sacraments should conferre grace not ex opere operato as they stifly hold but ex opere operantis
so much of the hand of the giver


vii
the instrument on our part which is as it were manus

accipientis the hand of the receiver is the grace of justifying faith which noted in the definition when said that the lord imputeth the righteousnesse of christ to a beleeving sinner
now as touching saith divers things are to be considered
for first it is said to justifie not as it

is a qualitie or habite in us as the papists teach ipsa fides saith bellarmine censetur esse justitia faith it selfe is accounted to be justice and it elfe is imputed unto righteousnesse rom

for so it is a part of sanctification but as it is the instrument and as it were the hand to receive

christ who is our righteousnesse
for if we should be justified by faith as it is an habit in us properly then we should be justified by habituall and inherent righteousnesse which hereafter

shall fully disproveand if we be not justified by it as it is an habit then much lesse as it is an act as and his followers teach as though undefined span alphabet ipsum credere did properly justifie
which opinion is worse than the other
for faith doth justifie as hereaster shall be proved as the instrument only but it is the instrument not as it is an act but as it is an habit producing that act and therefore it is said that we are justified by faith and that faith is imputed

unto righteousnesse
but if wee should bee justified by it as it is an act then we should be justified by our owne workes which hereafter

is also to be confuted and further if we were justified by it as it is an act then we should be no longer justified actually than we doe actually beleeve so there should bee an intercision of justification which proved before to be a continued act so ost as there is an intermission of the act of faith which is ridiculous
againe if wee should be justified by faith either as it is an habit or an act in sensu proprio as they speake and not relatively or metonymically then should we be justified by one habit alone or by the act of one habit and consequently by a partiall and most unperfect righteousnesse
when it is certaine that all the habits and acts of grace which are in the best concurring together are not
sufficient to justifie a man before god for the reasons hereafter to be delivered lib

it is true that faith is imputed for righteousnesse and is accepted of god as the perfect performance of the whole law but this is to bee understood relatively in respect of the object received by faith that is christ who is the end

and complement of the law to all that beleeve insomuch that whosoever truly beleeveth in christ hath fulfilled the law


viii
is the consequent of the former
for if faith doth justifie onely as it is an hand or instrument to apprehend and receive christ then justifying faith must be such a faith as doth apprehend

receive and embrace christ which is not done neither by the implicite nor the unformed nor the bare historical and generall faith of the papists but it is done first by a lively and effectuall assent to the speciall doctrine concerning justification and salvation by christ which is the condition of the evangelicall promise and then by a sound application of the promise to our selves as having that condition
for by a lively and effectuall beleefe we receive and embrace christ not only in our judgements by a willing and firme assent being undoubtedly perswaded and assured thathe is the saviour of all that truly beleeve in him but also in our hearts by an hungring desire to be made partakers of him and in our wils by resolving both to acknowledge him to be our saviour and also to rest upon him for salvation
having this lively assent which is the condition of the promise we are to apply the promise to our selves as belonging to us
by the former degree we are justified before god in foro coelesti by the latter we are justified in foro conscientiae in the court of our owne conscience
by the former we are justified properly by the latter

we are not properly justified but are in some measure assured of our justification
by the former doe effectually beleeve that iesus is the saviour by the latter doe truely beleeve that hee is my saviour
that faith therefore which doth justifie doth specially apprehend and apply christ and the proper object

of faith as it justifieth is christ or the promise of salvation by christ and therefore is often called faith in christ or the faith of christ
for although by that faith which justifieth beleeve all the articles of christian religion and every truth revealed by god in his word yet am not justified properly by beleeving any other truth but onely by beleeving the truth neither is the promise of justification and salvation made to any other beleefe but onely

to faith in christ


ix thirdly by this faith apprehending and receiving christ we are not prepared onely and disposed to justification as the papists absurdly teach affirming that faith doth justifie even as servile

feare doth by preparing onely and disposing for then a man indued with justifying faith might be as farre from justification as he that is possessed with servile feare
but how can these two assertions be reconciled that faith doth justifie by disposing onely as a preparative diposition and yet that it justifieth formally as an habit infused and as a part of inherent ustice
but the truth is that by a true justifying faith we are not prepared onely but wee are actually justified
for no sooner doth a man beleeve by a true justifying faith but he is justified

and entitled unto the kingdome of heaven
as soone as he doth beleeve he is translated

from death to life yea so soone he hath

eternall life that is hee hath jus right unto the heavenly kingdome


fourthly when wee say that faith doth justifie wee doe not

meane that it justifieth absolutely or in respect of its owne worth and dignity and much lesse that it doth merit justification either as it is an habit or as it is an act but relatively in respect of the object which it doth apprehend that is christ who is our righteousnesse for seeing faith doth receive christ and make us partakers of him therefore all those benefits which wee receive from christ are attributed in the holy scriptures to faith as to justifie to save

not that these effects are to bee ascribed to the vertue of faith absolutely but relatively in respect of the object
so when it was said to the woman thy

faith hath saved thee the meaning is christ received by faith hath saved thee
thus by the faith of peter and iohn the creeple was cured act


yet not by

any power or holinesse of theirs vers
but the name of christ that is christ himselfe by faith in his name as the instrument did cure him vers
so the name of christ by faith in his name doth justifie and save act


iohn

and that faith doth not justifie in respect of

its owne worth appeareth by this evidence because the faith of divers men though unequall in degrees doth justifie alike and therefore is called undefined span alphabet of equall value as saint peter speaketh of all the faithfull to whom he writeth pet


undefined span alphabet

that is as the latine interpreter translateth to them

that have obtained coequall faith with us in the righteousnesse of our god and saviour iesus christ
for it is not faith properly which doth justifie but the righteousnesse of christ received by faith
the almes received by a weake hand releeveth the party as well as that which is received by a strong hand because it is not the hand properly which releeveth but the almes
and for the same cause the righteousnesse of justification is equall in all that are justified neither doth it in the same persons admit of degrees
for it is the most perfect righteousnesse of christ to which considered as created and finite nothing can bee added


xi fifthly from hence we learne the true meaning of that question

whether we be justified by faith or by workes not as opposing the inward grace of faith to the outward acts of obedience which indeed are the fruits of faith but as opposing the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith to that righteousnesse which is inherent in our selves and performed by our selves


xii sixthly when we say that faith doth justifie alone two things

are implyed first that we are justified by the righteousnesse of christ alone apprehended by faith and not by any righteousnesse in herent in us
secondly that this righteousnesse of christ by which alone wee are justified is apprehended by faith onely
not that justifying faith is or can bee alone but because there being many graces in the faithfull which all have their severall commendations yet none of them serveth to apprehend christs righteousnesse but faith onely and yet that faith which is alone severed from all other inward graces and outward obedience doth not justifie either alone or at all because it is not a true and lively but a counterfeit and a dead faith
for even as the eye among all the parts of the body which all have their severall uses hath onely the faculty of seeing and yet that eye which is separated from the rest of the parts doth see neither alone nor at all because it is but the carcase of an eye
so among all the graces of the soule it is the office of faith alone as the eye of the soule to looke upon him that was figured by the brazen serpent yet if it should bee severed from the rest it were dead
for as saint iames

saith that faith which is alone and by it selfe is dead
and as the eye in respect of being is not alone yet in respect of seeing it is alone so faith which is not alone doth justifie alone

xiii
seventhly and lastly when we say that faith doth justifie

alone wee were never so absurd as the papists absurdly charge us as if wee meant that faith alone doth sanctifie
for although nothing in us doth conferre with faith to the act of justification as any cause thereof in which sense wee say it justifieth alone yet in the subject that is the party justified many graces doe concurre with faith as the necessary fruits thereof wherein as also in our obedience our sanctification standeth wherefore faith which justifieth alone is but one of those many graces wherein besides our obedience our sanctification doth consist

cap iii
of the essentiall causes of iustification viz
the matter and the forme


but let us come to the essentiall causes of justification that

is to say the matter and the forme
the matter of justification considered as it is an action of god is that which the lord imputeth unto us for righteousnesse and accepteth as our righteousnesse and that is the righteousnesse of christ which noted in the definition when said imputing to a beleeving sinner the righteousnesse of christ
the papists confounding not onely justice and justification but also the matter which is the materiall cause and the subject say that the matter of justification is the soule of

man or at the least the will of man because that is the seat of justice whereas indeed of justification though passively understood not the soule or the will is the subject but the person or the whole man
for justification is totius suppositi of the person and not of any part or faculty of man
but for the better clearing of this point let us briefly consider other not unlike actions first when rebecca arrayed or clothed her sonne iacob with the raiment of esau her elder sonne the matter of this action was that which being applyed unto him did clothe him viz esau's garment the forme of that action was the applying of it to him which was the indution or putting it on
for she clothed him by putting upon him esau's garment
so the lord justifieth us by putting upon us our eldest brothers righteousnesse which is our wedding garment
which similitude is used not only by saint

ambrose but also by pighius himselfe as heereafter

shall bee shewed
the matter therefore of justification is christs righteousnesse the forme is the imputing thereof
secondly the actions of redemption reconciliation and justification in substance are the same
as therefore the lord redeemeth us and reconcileth us by applying unto us and accepting for us the righteousnesse and merits of christ as the undefined span alphabet or price of ransome and as the propitiation for god was in christ reconciling the world to himselfe cor

so hee justifieth us by applying unto us and accepting for us the same righteousnesse and merits of christ as our righteousnesse
as the matter therefore of our redemption is the undefined span alphabet or price of ransome which christ payed for us the matter of reconciliation is the propitiatory sacrifice which christ offered for us the matter of justification is christs righteousnesse which hee had and performed for us so the forme of redemption as it is gods action is the applying unto us the price of ransome which christ payed and the

accepting of it in our behalfe the forme of reconciliation the applying unto us the propitiation made by christ and accepting of it in our behalfe the forme of justification the applying or imputing of christs righteousnesse unto us and accepting it in our behalfe
in like manner the papists if they would consider iustification as an action of god should according to their owne doctrine conceive that of their first justification whereby as they teach a sinner is made righteous by infusion of righteousnesse the matter is the righteousnesse infused or inherent the forme the infusion thereof because according to their doctrine the lord in the first justification maketh a man righteous by infusion of righteousnesse
the papists confesse after a sort the righteousnesse of christ to bee the merit of justification but they deny it to be the matter thereof whereas indeed it is both the matter as justification is the act of god imputing it the merit as justification is passively understood because for it wee are justified the matter say of gods justifying us the merit of our being justified
and this may appeare by the contrary for justification as hath beene said and shall bee proved is opposed

to condemnation
as therefore sinne is not onely the matter of condemnation which is the imputation of sinne but also the merit both of the sentence and of the punishment by the sentence awarded so the righteousnesse of christ is both the matter of justification as being that which god imputeth to us and also the merit both of the sentence of absolution and of eternall life unto which we are accepted


ii
but of the matter and forme of justification whereof am

hereafter to treat at large of the matter in the whole fourth booke of the forme in the fifth will here onely set downe briefly the orthodox doctrine of the reformed churches and maintaine it against the private opinions of some protestant divines who are not sound in these points

the matter of justification is that righteousnesse wherein wee stand

perfectly righteous before god
this in many places is called the righteousnesse of god
as rom





cor

pet


and is therefore called the righteousnesse of god because it is the righteousnesse of that person who is god

and therefore is not our righteousnesse but his not infused into us but inherent in his person

and imputed to us being without us in him
heare then wee are to consider whether this righteousnesse of god be the righteousnesse of christ as hee is god or as hee is mediator betwixt god and man

the man christ iesus
the righteousnesse of christ as he is god is the essentiall righteousnesse of the godhead
by which dwelling in man osiander supposed them to be justified
but this being the essentiall and uncreated righteousnesse of god which is his essence and therefore himselfe cannot be the righteousnesse of any who is not god and therefore if we should be justified thereby we should also bee deified
againe the essentiall righteousnesse of god being the essence of god and the very godhead cannot be communicated to any creature much

lesse can it become the accidentall righteousnesse of a creature
and farther it being the righteousnesse of the godhead is the common righteousnesse of the whole trinity the father the sonne and the holy ghost
and therefore if we should be justified thereby we should be justified by the righteousnesse of the father and of the holy ghost as well as by the righteousnesse the sonne


iii
it is not therefore the righteousnesse of the godhead
is it

then the righteousnesse of the manhood answer it is the righteousnesse of christ our mediator who is both god and man which he in his humanity had and performed in the dayes of his flesh for us
and this is to bee understood not of a part but of the whole righteousnesse of christ which was either inherent in the man christ or performed by him whether to fulfill the commandements or to satisfie the curse of the law for us
this righteousnesse of christ that may speake more distinctly of it is either negative if may so speake or positive
by the negative understand an absence of all sinnes and vices forbidden in the law
by the positive meane both a presence of all vertues and duties required to the perfect fulfilling of the commandements and also of the voluntary suffering of the penalty to satisfie the commination and curse of the law
the negative is that which wee call the innocencie of christ whereof the scriptures speake in many places

signifying that he was not onely blamelesse free in himselfe from all imputation of sinne being undefined span alphabet unreproveable undefined span alphabet unblameable iohn

pet


but also spotlesse free from all infection of

sinne as being undefined span alphabet without spot pet


undefined span alphabet harmelesse and undefiled heb

one who never did nor spke evill pet


nor ever offended in thought but was absolutely and in all respects undefined span alphabet without sinne heb

as one

who knew

no sinne


iv
the positive righteousnesse of christ is twofold his perfect

fulfilling of all things commanded in the law and his perfect satisfaction in respect of the punishment threatned
the former is the holinesse of christ which the apostle calleth the law of the spirit of life in christ rom

which is also twofold the holinesse of his nature

which is his habituall righteousnesse the holinesse of his life and conversation which is his actuall obedience
the holinesse of his nature

in that being conceived of the holy ghost and sanctified by him matth


luk

hee was also adorned with all vertues and

graces and that without measure iohn

in respect whereof hee was said to be annointed with the oyle of gladnesse above his fellowes psalm


for he was full of the spirit esai

full of grace and

truth iohn

full say not plenitudine vasis in which sense fome of the faithfull have beene said to have beene full of the holy ghost and full of grace but plenitudine fontis for of his fulnesse wee receive even grace for grace iohn

according to the measure of the donation

of christ ephes


the holinesse of christs life was that whereby

he continued in all the things which were written in the booke of the

law to doe them and that for us
for he came not to breake the law

but to fulfill it matth


he fulfilled all righteousnesse matth

and alwayes did those things which please god ioh

hee performed in his flesh undefined span alphabet whatsoever the law requireth to justification rom

and therefore most worthily is hee often called in the scriptures not only righteous and holy as esay

act


heb

ioh

apoc

but also the just and the holy act


the just ioh

the holy one of god act


the holy of holies dan



the other part of christs positive righteousnesse is his passive obedience which is called obedientia crucis the obedience of the crosse

wherein hee willingly submitted himselfe to endure those punishments for us which might satisfie the iustice of god and the sentence of the law for our sinnes as it is said phil


hee humbled himselfe and became obedient to the death even the death of the crosse and gal



christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law himselfe being made a curse for us
now this passive obedience appeareth not onely in his death and passion though in that principally but also in all other his sufferings which hee voluntarily sustained for us in the whole course of his life as

poverty

shame

sorrow
the matter therefore of our justification is that whole righteousnesse which was either inherent in the man christ or performed by him whether to fulfill the commandements or to satisfie the curse of the law for us


this righteousnesse of christ our mediatour though inherent

in the humane nature and performed by it yet is most truely and to us most comfortably called according to that kinde of phrase which is termed undefined span alphabet the communication of properties the righteousnesse of god because it is the righteousnesse of that person which is god who though a branch of david according to the flesh is iehovah our righteousnesse ier

god above all blessed for evermore rom


in this sense the iewes are said to have killed the author of life act


and to have crucified the lord of glory cor

for as the blessed virgin

is said to be undefined span alphabet the mother of god because she is the mother

of that person who is god so the righteousnesse of our mediator who is both god and man is called the righteousnesse of god because it is the righteousnesse of that person who is perfect god
thus that blood by which wee are redeemed is called the blood of

god act


or which is all one the blood of the sonne of god ioh

the life which was laid downe for us was the life of god ioh

the death by which wee are reconciled to god is the death

of his sonne rom

the obedience by which wee are constituted just rom

is the obedience of the same sonne of god who being

god coequall with his father humbled himselfe and became obedient to his father even unto death phil


and being the sonne

of god was made subject to the law that hee might redeeme those that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sonnes gal




vi
this doctrine of the gospell that the righteousnesse by

which we are justified is the righteousnesse of god is the chiefe stay of our faith and the principall foundation of our comfort
for hereby wee understand his sufferings to bee an satisfaction to redeeme us from hell and his obedience of merit to entitle us unto the kingdome of heaven
and that wee might know undoubtedly that his sufferings were the sufferings of god and his obedience the obedience of god that is of him that is god therefore by his divine spirit by which hee had offered himselfe to god

he raised himselfe from death to life and to

glory by which his resurrection hee was mightily declared to be the sonne

of god that our faith and hope might bee in god
for had not christ risen from the dead it had beene a plaine evidence of his not being god and then our faith

were vane and we should yet remaine in our sinnes
but seeing iesus christ who is of god made unto us

righteousnesse is god even

iehovah our righteousnesse hence wee learne that the righteousnesse by which we are justified is the righteousnesse of god and consequently of infinite price and merit
for although the godhead of christ neither obeyed nor suffered any thing for us yet seeing the person which obeyed and suffered was and is not onely man but also god therefore the godhead affordeth such dgnity vertue efficacy and merit to the obedience and sufferings of his manhood as that his sufferings are an allsufficient price of ransome and satisfaction for the sinnes of the whole world as being the sufferings of god and therefore of infinite value and his holinesse and obedience being the righteousnesse of god and therefore of infinite merit and farre surpassing the righteousnesse of all men and angels maketh all those to whom it is imputed most perfectly righteous before god in christ
wherefore they who are clothed with this royall robe of christs righteousnesse as all the faithfull are may with boldnesse appeare before the judgement seat of god because they stand just before him not in their owne righteousnesse which is unperfect but in the most perfect righteousnesse of christ against which no just exception can be taken
after this righteousnesse therefore of christ wee ought to hunger

and thirst after this righteousnesse of god

wee ought principally to seeke· to obtaine this most precious

perle we are to forgoe all that we have esteemimg our owne righteousnesse in the question of justification if it should be obtruded as the matter thereof and whatsoever else of ours might seeme to bee an advantage unto us or among men as polluted

clouts as

dung and the opinion of our owne worthinesse and righteousnesse as

losse so we may obtaine that pearle and that wee gaining christ may bee found in him not as having our owne righteousnesse which is that which is prescribed in the aw but that which is by the faith of christ the righteousnesse which is of god by faith that is the righteousnesse of christ which is imputed of god being apprehended by faith
now that this righteousnesse of god is the matter of our justification before god and not any righteousnesse inhernt in us

or performed by us shall prove at large in my fourth and seventh bookes
here onely alleage the plaine testimonies of the holy ghost

that christ is made unto us of god our righteousnesse cor
that hee is

iehovah our righteousnesse and that by his blood wee are justified and absolved from our sinnes rom

and by his obedience

opposite to adams disobedience wee are made or constituted just rom


vii
the formall cause of justification is the imputation of christs

righteousnesse because by imputing it the lord doth justifie which expressed in the definition
and this necessarily followeth upon that which hath beene said of the matter
for it cannot bee imagined how we should be justified by that righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him otherwise than by imputation
for even as wee were made sinners by adams personall

disobdience so wee ae made righteous by the obedience of chist
but how could we either be made sinners by adams disobedience or justified by the obedience of christ whether active or passive unlesse they were communicated unto us
how could they possibly bee communicated unto us being both transient and having now no being for true is that saying of a learned philosopher

motus non est nisi dum fit postquam factus est non est a motion whether it be action or passion hath no beig but whiles it is in doing or suffering after it is done it hath no being
adams tranl gression was transient and is past and gone so many thousand yeeres past the active obedience of christ was transient and so was his passive obedience which had a being in rerum natura no longer than they were in doing and in susring
how then can either adams disobedience or christs obedience be communicated unto us answer in respect of both as bellarmine

answereth in respect of the former
communicatur eo modo quo communicari potest id quod transit nimirum per imputationem it is communicated after that manner whereby that may be communicated which is transient and gone to wit by imputation


viii
the same bellarmine

with other papists doth confesse that the satisfaction of christ is imputed unto us but the imputation of his righteousnesse they deny when as indeed the imputation of christs atisfaction is the imputation of his righteousnesse for what is christs satisfaction but that whereby hee ully satisfied the law and consequently the justice of god for us which he did both in respect of the penalty which he fully satisfied by

bearing our iniquities and also of the commandements by fulfilling them the former is the obedience of the crosse or his passive righteousnesse the latter is his conformity to the law which is both his habituall and actuall righteousnesse
by the former he freeth us from hell· by the latter he doth entitle us to the kingdome of heaven
but the meaning of the papists is that christ by his satisfaction doth free us from hell but as for heaven we must attaine to it by our owne merits as if there needed not so great a price to purchase heaven as to redeeme from hell
but it is certaine that there is required as infinite merit to purchase heaven as there is

required infinite satisfaction to redeeme from hell
in respect of both god accepteth of no righteousnesse to our justification that is either to free us from hell or to entitle us unto the kingdome of heaven but that which is of infinite value because the offence of sinne for which satisfaction is to be made is infinite and because the reward which is to be merited is of infinite worth
but that righteousnesse may bee of infinite value it is not necessary as bellarmine

himselfe teacheth that it should be infinite in it selfe but it is sufficient that it bee the righteousnesse of an infinite person
and such is the righteousnesse of christ as being the righteousnesse of him that is god such is not the righteousnesse of any meere creature which is an invincible argument as hereafter shall bee shewed to prove that wee are justified not by any righteousnesse in our selves but onely by imputation of christs righteousnesse


ix
and yet this imputation of christs righteousnesse without

which there can be no salvation is denied not onely by the papists but by some others hereafter to be mentioned in the fifth chapter of this booke who seeme to have beene drawne to this opinion by this argument of the papists which will therefore in this place answer for their satisfaction
if say they christs righteousnesse and merits whereby

hee redeemeth and saveth men should bee imputed unto us then should we thereby become saviours and redeemers of others but this latter is false therefore the former
answere deny the consequence of the proposition for first when we say that we are justified by imputation of christs righteousnesse our meaning is this that the lord accepteth for us and in our behalfe the obedience and mrits of christ as if we had performed the same for our selves in our owne persons
for as the merit of christ is the common price of redemption sufficient for the salvation of all universally so it is the price for every particular and so is applyed to every particular not as the common price redeeming all but as the price of those soules in particular to whom it is particularly applyed
secondly the efficacie or effect of imputation dependeth upon the will of the imputer and therefore the force of it cannot be extended further than he extendeth it which is the justification of the parties to whom it is imputed but no further
thirdly the consequence of the proposition doth no more follow than if should argue thus if by imputation of adams transgression others are made guilty of sinne and damnation then they to whom adams transgression is imputed are made the cause and fountaine of sinne and damnation in all others but of the first and second adam we should conceive not as of private men but the first adam is to be considered as the root of mankind in whom when he fell all sinned
the second as the head of all that shall be saed in whom as the head communicating his merits to his members all the faithfull have as his members fulfilled the law and satisfied the justice of god for themselves
the head and the body saith

thomas aquinas are as it were one mysticall person and therefore the satisfaction of christ belongeth to all the faithfull as to his

members the lord accepting in their behalfe the obedience and merits of christ as if they had performed the same in their owne persons not for others but for themselves
and therefore by imputation of christs righteousnesse they are not redeemers but redeemed
for though christ who is the saviour of his body communicate to his members his obedience yet not his headship nor his mediatorship in respect whereof hee was and is both god and man
man to doe and suffer god to give infinite value and worth to that which his person did or suffered for the justification and salvation of all those to whom his righteousnesse should bee communicated and imputed but not to make them redeemers and saviours of others
the righteousnesse of the head is of sufficient vertue to justifie and redeeme all the members to whom it is imputed but being imputed the merit thereof extendeth no further than to what end it is imputed that is to save the member not to make it a saviour nor to confound the members with the head nor to take away the proportion that is and ought bee betweene the head and the members
fourthly to the papists who confesse christs satisfaction to be imputed unto us returne the like argument
if christs satisfaction whereby he redeemed mankind bee imputed unto us then are we also redeemers of mankind but they will not not cannot inferre that therefore we are redeemers but that wee among others are redeemed



but that we are justified onely by the imputation of christs righteousnesse shall by the helpe of god fully prove hereafter in my whole fifth booke
here onely for a tast will but point at two argumenss

the former out of rom



the basis or ground whereof is this that whom the lord justifieth to them he imputeth righteousnesse
now this righteousnesse is either the parties owne or of another
not their owne for they are sinners and being sinners they cannot bee justified by righteousnesse inherent but righteousnesse is imputed to them without workes that is without respect of any obedience performed by themselves
therefore it is the righteousnesse of another that other is no other nor can be any other but christ onely therefore by imputation of his righteousnesse we are justified
the second shall bee out of cor

as christ was made sinne for us so are wee made

the righteousnesse of god in him
by imputation of our sinne to him christ who knew no sinne was made sinne and a sinner for us therefore by imputation of his righteousnesse which here is called the righteousnesse of god we who are sinners in our selves are made righteous not in our selves but in him

cap iv
whether wee are justified by the passive righteousnesse of christ only



now come to the private opinions of some of our divines

concerning the matter and some of our justification
for some as touching the matter doe hold that we are justified by the passive righteousnesse of christ onely
of these men some doe not hold the matter of justification to bee the passive righteousnesse of christ it selfe but a righteousnesse morte christi partu purchased by the death of christ as the meritorious cause thereof viz remission of sinnes which they not without absurdity say is imputed to us
for what is remission of sinne but the not imputing of it if therefore wee bee justified by imputation of the remission of sinne then are we justified by the imputation of the not imputing of sinne
againe the authors of this opinion confound justice with justification for they say that remission of sinne is our justice and that justification is nothing also but remission when indeed neither the one nor the other is justice but an action of god imputing righteousnesse and not imputing sinne unto us
others hold that by the passive righteousnesse of christ it selfe meaning thereby his death and passion we are justified as by the onely matter of justification imputed to us
but that wee are not justified by the passive righteousnesse of christ alone it may appeare by these reasons


ii
by what alone the law is fully satisfied by that we are justified

and by what alone the law is not fully satisfied by that alone wee are not justified
by the whole righteousnesse of christ that is to say the righteousnesse of his person that is his holinesse or habituall righteousnesse the righteousnesse of his life which was his obedience or actuall righteousnesse the righteousnesse of his death and passion which is obedientia crucis or his passive righteousnesse the law was fully satisfied or fulfilled but by the passive obedience alone of christ the law was not fulfilled therefore by the whole righteousnesse of christ and not by the passive onely we are justified
the proposition is thus proved there is no justification before god without perfect and compleat righteousnesse for without that no man can stand in judgement before god and to imagine that a man is justified without justice is as absurd as to conceive that a man is cloathed without apparell for they that are justified are clothed

with righteousnesse as having

put on christ whose righteousnesse is their wedding garment

signified by that white and shining linnen

which are the justifications

of the saints
but there is no perfect righteousnesse but that which fulfilleth the law and is fully conformable unto it it being the perfect perpetuall and immutable

rule of righteousnesse matth


therefore without the fulfilling of the law either by our selves or by another for us there is no justification
now to the full satisfying and fulfilling of the law since the fall of adam two things are required not onely a perfect and perpetuall conformity to the law to satisfie the commandement and to fulfill the condition of the legall

promise doe this and live but also a full satisfaction to the sentence of the law by bearing the penalty therein denounced in regard of sinnes already committed
againe faith or the true doctrine of justification by faith doth not abrogate the

law but establish it
but if it should teach justification without christs fulfilling of the law for us it should abrogate the law and not establish it

iii
of the assumption there are two parts the former affirmative

that by the whole righteousnesse of christ the law is fully satisfied and fulfilled for by his sufferings the penalty of the law is fully satisfied for us to free us from hell and by his righteousnes both habtuall and actuall the commandements were fulfilled for us to entitle us unto heaven
neither of which we were able to performe for our selves for neither could wee satisfie the penalty but by everlasting punishment neither could wee fulfill the commandement but by a totall perfect and perpetuall obedience which to us by reason of the flesh is unpossible
and this was the miserable estate wherein the law did hold us both to bee accursed if but once and that in the least degree wee did breake it which the best of us often doe and sometimes in an high degree and to be excluded from justification and salvation if wee did not fully and perfectly fulfill it which since the fall hath beene impossible
wherefore as without imputation of christs sufferings we could not bee freed from hell so without his obedience and perfect conformity to the law imputed unto us wee cannot be justified or saved
by the former our blessed saviour hath redeemed us from the curse

of the law himselfe being made a curse for us by the latter hee maketh us partakers of the promised blessednesse by performing for us that righteousnesse which was the condition of the promise doe this and live

the negative part is that by the onely passive righteousnesse of christ the law is not fulfilled
the law indeed is thereby fully satisfied in our behalfe for the avoiding of the penalty therein threatned but not fulfilled in respect of the commandement for the obtaining of the blessednesse therein promised
for the righteousnesse which is of the law is thus described that the man

which doth those things which are commanded shall live therein

iiii
against this assumption divers exceptions are taken
first that the law is satisfied either by doing that which is commanded or by bearing the punishment which is threatned
answ
it is true in respect of the penall statutes of men but not in respect of gods commandements

in which there is not onely a penalty threatned but blessednesse also promised
if man had continued in his integrity the law might have beene satisfied by obedience onely but being fallen into a state of disobedience two things are necessarily required to the fulfilling of the law the bearing of the penalty in respect of sinne already committed to escape hell and the perfect performing of the commandements which is the condition of the covenant doe this and live to attaine to the life promised but neither alone will suffice to justification
for neither will our obedience satisfie for the punishment

as bellarmine confesseth nor the bearing of the punishment performe the condition of the promise
but both must concurre

inst

but it will be said that whosoever are freed from hell

are also admitted into heaven
answ
the reason thereof is because our saviour who did beare the punishment to free them from hell did also fulfill the commandements to bring them to heaven
but howsoever these two benefits of christ doe alwayes concurre in the party justified as the causes thereof concurre in christ who not onely did both obey and suffer but in obeying suffered and in suffering obeyed yet both the causes betweene themselves and the effects are to be distinguished
for as it is one thing to obey the commandement another to suffer the punishment so it is one thing to be freed from hell by christ his suffering the penalty another to be entituled to heaven by his fulfilling the commandements

vi inst
ii
yea but god is a most free agent and therefore

may if he will justifie men by the passive righteousnesse of christ onely without fulfilling of the law
answ
what god may doe if hee will will not dispute but ure am that he justifieth men according to his will revealed in his word
wherein it is revealed first that god hath taken that course for the justifying and saving of sinners as serveth most for the illustration of the glory of his justice

as well as of his mercy
and therefore as in mercy he freeth none from hell for whom his justice is not satisfied so in mercy hee admitteth none to heaven for whom christ hath not by his obedience merited the fame
secondly it is revealed that the judgement of god is according to the

truth and therefore he justifieth none by his sentence but such as hee maketh just by imputation of christs righteousnesse thereby not onely absolving them from their sinnes but also accepting yea constituting them righteous in christ
thirdly that as wee are justified from our sinnes by the blood of christ so we are made

just by his obedience that as he was made finne for us so we were made

the righteousnesse of god in him that as wee are reconciled unto god by the death

of his sonne so wee are justified and saved by his life by his life say which he lived before his death in the dayes of his flesh and by the life which he lived and doth live after his death
by the acts of his life before his death meritoriously by the acts of his life after his death as his

resurrection his ascension his session at the right hand of his father and intercession his comming againe to judgement hee

saveth us effectually that christ as hee was made unto us redemption so also righteousnesse that as hee came to deliver us from sinne so to

bring in everlasting righteousnesse dan



vii
inst
iii
if we bee justified by christ his fulfilling of the

law then wee are justified by a legall righteousnesse but wee are not justified by a legall justice but by such a righteousnesse as without the law is revealed in the gospell
answ
the same righteousnesse by which we are justified is both legall and evangelicall in divers respects
legall in respect of christ who being made under the

law that hee might redeeme us who were under the law perfectly fulfilled the law for us
evangelicall in respect of us unto whom his fulfilling of the law is imputed
and herein standeth the maine both agreement and difference betweene the law and the gospell
the agreement that both unto justification require the perfect fulfilling of the law the difference that the law requireth to justification perfect obedience to be performed in our owne persons
the gospell propoundeth to justification the righteousnesse of

god that is the perfect righteousnesse of christ who is god performed for us and accepted in the behalfe of them that beleeve as if it had been performed in their own persons

viii
our second reason
as by the disobedience of the first adam by which he transgressed the law men were made sinners his disobedience being imputed to them so by the obedience

of the second adam whereby hee fulfilled the law men are made righteous his obedience being imputed to them
in answer to this argument two novelties are broached the former that as wee were made sinners by one act of disobedience committed by one man and that but once so we are justified by one act of obedience performed by one and that but once which was that oblation of christ whereby hee but once

offered himselfe
whereunto reply first that betweene sinne whereby the law is broken and obedience whereby the law is fulfilled there is great ods
the law is broken by any one act of sinne for hee that offendeth in any

one is guilty of all
but the law is not fulfilled by any one act of obedience but by a totall perfect and perpetuall observation of the law for by the sentence

of the law hee is accursed whosoever doth not continue in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them
but in no one act of obedience there neither is nor can bee a continuance in doing all the things that are commanded
secondly that although the obedience by which we are justified was but of one man yet it was not one act but as the apostle calleth it in the verse going

before undefined span alphabet
now undefined span alphabet

is all that the law requireth to justification
the second novelty is that neither adam in sinning transgressed the law nor our saviour in his obedience to death obeyed the law
for neithe the commandement given to the first adam concerning the forbidden fruit nor the commandement given to the second adam concerning his suffering of death for us was any commandement of the law no more than the commandement given to abraham for the sacrificing of his sonne or

to the israelites for the spoiling of the aegyptians but a speciall commandement
whereto reply that although every thing which god commandeth in particular be not expressed in the law yet wee have a generall commandement

expressed in the law that whatsoever god commandeth we must doe and if we doe it not we sinne and every sinne is undefined span alphabet that is

a transgression of the law

ix
our third reason
if christ by his conformity to the law fulfilled the law for us then his obedience in fulfilling of the law is

accepted of god in our behalfe as if wee had fulfilled it in our owne persons but christ by his conformity to the law fulfilled the law for us therefore his obedience in fulfilling of the law is accepted of god in our behalfe as if wee had fulfilled it in our owne persons that is to say both his habituall and actuall righteousnesse is imputed to us
the consequence of the proposition is necessary for if hee performed obedience for us and in our behalfe he performed it in vaine if it be not accepted for us and in our behalfe
the assumption also is of necessary truth for first that christ did fulfill the law it is evident for himselfe professeth that he came to fulfill the law matth


that it became

him to fulfill all righteousnesse matth


that he did alwayes those things which please god ioh

and the scripture testifieth that not for himselfe but for us hee fulfilled undefined span alphabet

whatsoever the law requireth to justification that his whole life was a perpetuall course of obedience

undefined span alphabet even untill his death which he performed not for himselfe for as hee was incarnate not for himselfe but for us men and for our salvation for it was the exinanition

of himselfe so being incarnate he sanctificed

himselfe for us and was made under the

law not for himselfe for that was a farther degree of humiliation that being man hee humbled himselfe to bee obedient

even untill his death and therein also humbled himselfe to undergoe the death of the crosse
the apostle rom

teacheth that christ is th end that is the perfection undefined span alphabet as the greeke fathers speake that is complement of the law to all that beleeve unto righteousnesse that is that hee hath fulfilled the law for all beleevers in so much that all who truely beleeve have in christ fulfilled the law
upon which place remigius writing saith christus fin gis in completio legis christ the end of the

law that is the fulfilling of the law theodoret
he that beleeveth in our lord christ hee hath fulfilled the scope of the law and what that is chrysostome sheweth
for saith hee what did the law intend to make a man just but it was not

able for never any fulfilled it but this end our saviour christ hath

more amply accomplished through faith if therefore

thou beleevest in christ th hast not onely fulfilled the law but much more than it commanded for thou hast received a farre greater righteousnesse and what can that be but the righteousnesse of christ and photias

whosoever therefore saith the apostle beleeveth in christ hee fulfilleth the law
sedulius likewise

hee hath the perfection of the law who beleeveth in christ
this therefore doth plainely prove that christs obedience in fulfilling the law is imputed to all that beleeve unto righteousnesse

as if themselves had fulfilled it
and this is the conceived doctrine of the church of england

that christ satisfied the justice of god and redeemed us not onely by the oblation of his body and shedding of his blood but also by the full and perfect fulfilling of the law and the same was taught by

calvin not to mention all the rest of our divines christum sc nos reconciliasse deo justitiam acquisivisse toto obedientiae suae cursu



but against this assumption divers things are objected

first they feare not to say which feare to relate that christ obeyed the law not for us but for himselfe for they say that christ as he was man was bound to obey the law for himselfe which assertion detracteth from the merit of his obedience from the bounty of his grace from the dignity of his person
from his merit for if his obedience were of duety then were it not meritorious as himselfe teacheth luk

for debitum non est meritum
and if this be true that christs

obedience is not meritorious than have we no title to heaven
from his bounty if what he did indeed for us and not for himselfe hee should be thought to have done for himselfe and not for us
from the dignity of his peson as if either he needed to obey for himselfe or by his obedience hee were any way bettered in himselfe or improved
but these men shold have remembred that the person who as both of us confesse did obey the law was and is not onely man but god also and therefore as his bloud was gods bloud

so his obedience was the obedience

of god and consequently was performed not of duty nor for himselfe
for if of duty then had god been a debtor to the law neither needed the humane nature being by personall union united to the divine to obey or to merit for it selfe seeing from the first moment of the conception thereof it was personally united to the deity of the sonne of god in whose person it subsisting was from the beginning of the being thereof most happy and enjoying the beatificall vision being at that time as the schoolemen speake both viator comprehensor
neither did the humane nature which doth not subsist by it selfe work any thing by it selfe in the worke of our redemption but god manifested

in the flesh did in and by it both obey and suffer for us
and as the eternall son of god being god coequall with the father assumed the humane nature and became man not for himselfe for his incarnation was an

abasing of himselfe as it were to nothing for man compared to god is as

nothing if not as lesse than nothing but for us men and for our salvation so being man whatsoever he did or suffered in obedience to god was not for himselfe for it was a further

debasing of himselfe but for us and as for us he sanctified himselfe iohn

so for us he performed all righteousnesse matth


and fulfilled the law for us matth


that whatsoever the law requireth to justification might bee fulfilled

in it rom



xi
but here the papists object

that our saviour christ by his humiliation did merit his exaltation because the apostle saith that therefore god exalted him phil


answere
in every aetiologie the

reason which is rendred is in a large sense called the cause though it may be any other argument which is not the cause of the consequent but of the consequence as here humiliation was not the cause but the way to exaltation and exaltation not the effect but the consequent as

it is said luk

ought not christ to suffer these things and so to enter to his glory and this appeareth by the scope of the apostle in that place which is to exhort us to the imitation

of our saviour christ his charity and humility
of his charity in that hee being god for our sakes became man and being man

humbled himselfe further and became obedient untill his death even the death of the crosse
of his humility in that it was the way to his glory
for before honour

is humility and he that humbleth himselfe shall be exalted
but humiliation is so farre from being the cause of exaltation that it is the contrary

to it even as corruption to generation and losse to recovery yet because recovery presupposeth losse and the generation of one the corruption of another and the exaltation of the sonne of god his foregoing humiliation therefore each of these may be said to be causa sine qua non as all necessary forerunners may though they be no causes even as fabius when livius salinator bad him remember that by his meanes hee had recovered why should not remember it saith he had never recovered it unlesse thou haddst lost it cic
de oratore

and further adde that the exaltation of christ whereof the apostle

speaketh was not the exaltation of him to be the sonne of god for that hee was from all eternity but the manifestation thereof
for although in respect of christs resurrection

especially it be said thou art my sonne this day have begotten thee yet was not christ then first begotten whose generation is eternall but then he was mightily declared to bee the sonne of god by his resurrection rom

and

this was that name above all names which god did give unto him after his humiliation his manifesting and declaring him by his resurrection to be the sonne of god
so the apostle saith heb

that christ

hath obtained a more excellent name than the angels for unto which of the angells said he at any time thou art my sonne this day have begotten thee this exaltation was a necessary consequent of his humiliation and that in two respects first for avoyding the scandall of the crosse for having taken upon him the forme of a servant and therein having humbled himselfe to become obedient untill death and to the death of the crosse it was necessary lest men should take offence at his great humiliation and refuse to beleeve in a man that had beene crucified that he should mightily be declared to bee the sonne of god by his resurrection ascension and sitting at the right hand of his father secondly this declaration of christ to bee the sonne of god was to follow his humiliation as a necessary stay of our faith in christ for if christ had not risen againe

then had our faith beene vaine and wee had remained in our sinnes
but by his resurrection and exaltation whereby he was powerfully declared to be the eternall sonne of god

wee understand that the obedience which he had performed and the suffering which hee sustained for us were not the obedience and sufferings of mre a man but of him that is god for which cause saint peter saith that god did raise him and give him glory that our faith

and hope might be in god


xii
if they will needs with the arrians

understand the place of christs exaltation it selfe which is his filiation and not of the declaration thereof thereupon it will follow that christ by his obedience and sufferings in the humane nature had merited to bee god but this hee had not by purchase but by nature and therefore himselfe prayed a little before his death ioh

and now father glorifie mee with the

glory not which have merited by my death but with that glory which had with thee before the world wa
and it is evident that the glory whereunto christ in this place is said to be exalted is proper to god himselfe esay

and this may suffice for this point for will not

trouble the reader with those two other allegations of our rhemists the one out of apoc

that the lambe which was slaine was worthy

to receive power and as they read divinity from whence they should prove if they prove any thing that christ by his sufferings in his humanity merited his divinity
the other heb

that christ

because of the passion of death was crowned with glory and honour where the words are thus to be construed according to the distinction and interpretation of the

fathers wee see iesus crowned with glory and honour who for a shor time was made lesse than the angels viz by hi incarnaion for the suffering of death that is that hee might suffer death or as the apostle speaketh that by the grace of god hee might viz in the humane nature assumed tast of death for all


xiii
object

if christ obeyed the law for us that by his

obedience we might be justified then shall not wee need to obey the law but the consequent is absurd therefore the antecedent
answere that we need not to obey the law to that end that we may thereby be justified for from that yoke of most miserable bondage excluding us from if we doe no perfectly fulfill the law in our owne persons our saviour christ hath freed us the condition which the law requireth to justification being utterly impossible to us by reason of the flesh
but howsoever we cannot perfectly fulfill the law that we must thinke our selves bound sincerely to keepe it that is we must have an desire an unsained purpose a serious care an upright endevour to walke in the obedience of gods commandements in this study and practice of piety consisteth our new obedience which we must be carefull to performe not to be justified thereby but to glorifie god to obey his will to restifie our thankfulnesse towards him to edifie our brethren to gather sound testimonies to our selves and assurance of our

justification and so to make our calling and our election sure


xiv object

if wee be justified by the obedience of christs life what needed he to dye for us answ the chiefest part of his obedience was to be performed at his death his totall obedience was his

fulfilling of the whole law for us
the law since the fall is fulfilled neither by an obedience conformable to the commandements alone because wee are all sinners nor by suffering the punishment alone but by both
and therefore christ performed both for us that by both we might be justified
but this objection will requite with

xv
our fourth reason
if wee bee justified altogether by the

death and passion of christ onely to what end and purpose serveth his habituall righteousnesse and actuall obedience by which hee was obedient to the law in the whole course of his life doing alwayes those things which are

pleasing to god performing

all righteousnesse fulfilling

the law and whatsoever the law

requireth to justification these things as shewed before he did not for himselfe therefore for us and in our stead
to this some of our aforesaid divines doe answer that christ indeed fulfilled the law for our sakes but they put a difference betweene pro and propter saying that christ obeyed the law pro se not pro nobis sed propter nos that is for our sakes but not for us or in our stead which some expresse thus that he might be sanctus ponifex and sacra victima an holy priest and an holy sacrifice
others thus that these things are required in christ that in his blood hee may bee righteousnesse unto us

that he who dyed for us liveth pro nobis

that he was made a priest pro nobis

pro omnibus mortuus pro omnibus resurrexit answ
this to me seemeth but a shallow conceit
for who is the priest and what is the sacrifice was not the priest the son of god both god and man was not the sacrifice the flesh or human nature of the son of god surely if christ had never submitted himselfe to obey the law yet he being god had been a most holy priest his body and blood being the body and blood of god had beene a most holy and sacrifice
neither was it the holinesse of the humanity that sanctified the sacrifice or gave the vertue of satisfaction unto it but the dignity of the person and the vertue of the godhead which made the righteousnesse of the man christ as well active as passive to bee meritorious and satisfactory for others
iesus christ therefore being both god and man was and is our high priest who offered the sacrifice of his humanity upon the altar of his deity which sanctified the sacrifice and made it an satisfaction for the sinnes of all that beleeve
it is the spirit saith our saviour christ that giveth life the flesh by it selfe profiteth nothing ioh

the sufferings or obedience of christ as hee is man

considered apart from the godhead are neither satisfactory nor meritorious

for others but being the sufferings of god they are a sufficient price of ransome to free us from hell and being the obedience of god is of sufficient merit to entitle us unto the kingdome of heaven


xvi
our fifth reason
there are two parts of justification the

one the absolving from the guilt of sinne and damnation the other the accepting of a beleeving sinner as righteous unto life the former is wrought by the sufferings of christ imputed as a full satisfaction for sinne the other by imputation of christs perfect obedience as a sufficient merit of eternall life by the former we are freed from hell by the latter we are entituled to the kingdome of heaven
of them both the

apostle speaketh rom
that we are justified that is absolved from our sinne by the bloud of christ

and that wee are justified that is constituted just by his obedience vers
to this argument they answere by denying the antecedent saying that there are no parts of justification but that it wholly consisteth in remission of sinnes
indeed if it were the onely matter of justification as some of them teach and the entire formall cause of justification as others avouch of whom we shall speake in the next chapter say if both these opinions were true then would confesse that the whole nature of justification doth consist in forgivenesse of sinne but whiles it is either but the matter as some say or but the forme as others or neither of both as avouch it is a manifest errour to say that justification consisteth wholly in remission of sinnes
againe in every mutation though it be but relative we must of necessity acknowledge two termes trminum quo terminum ad quem the denomination being taken commonly from the terminus ad quem
as in justification there is a motion or mutation from sinne to justice from which terme justification hath its name from a state of death and damnation to a state of life and salvation
but if justification be nothing else but bare remission of sinne then is there in it onely a not imputing of sinne but no acceptation as righteous a freedome from hell but no title to heaven
to this they answere that to whom sinne is not imputed righteousnesse is imputed and they who are freed from hell are admitted to heaven
doe grant that these things doe alwayes concurre but yet they are not to bee confounded for they differ in themselves and in their causes and in their effects in themselves for it is one thing to bee acquitted from the guilt of sinne another thing to be made righteous as wee see daily in the pardons of malefactors in their causes for remission of sinne is to be attributed to christs satisfactory sufferings the acceptation as righteous unto life to christs meritorious obedience
in their effects for by remission of sinne wee are freed from hell and by imputation of christs obedience we have right unto heaven


xvii
if unto justification there be required besides remission

of sinne imputation of righteousnesse then there are two formall causes of justification
answ
it followeth not for although there bee two trmini in this mutation yet there is but one action and this

one action is the onely forme of justification viz imputation of christs righteousnesse of which are two effects which also be the two parts of justification remission of sinne and acceptation as righteous as said in the definition that justification is an action of god wherein hee imputing the righteousnesse of christ to a beleeving sinner doth not onely absolve him from his sinnes but also accepteth of him as righteous and as an heire of eternall life


xviii
notwithstanding this so evident truth some of the

divines of whom we spake when they would prove justification by the passive righteousnesse of christ onely take this position for granted that justification is nothing but remission of sinne and hereupon inferre that seeing wee have remission of sinne onely by the bloud of christ we are justified by his bloud onely and to this purpose they alleage many testimonies of scriptures affirming that by the bloud of christ and by his death and passion wee have remission of sinne to all which we readily subscribe
but if there be any other places that seeme to ascribe unto the sufferings of christ more than remission of sinnes as entrance into heaven and salvation such places are to be understood by a synecdoche putting the chiee and most eminent part of his obedience for the whole
others labour to prove this assertion that justification is nothing but remission of sinne by testimonies and by reasons and to this purpose collect a multitude of testimonies of protestant divines who against the papists have maintained that justification confisteth in remission of sinnes onely
but this assertion as hereafter shall shew is to be understood as spoken in opposition to the papists who unto justification besides remission of sinnes require inward renovation or sanctification and therefore their meaning was to exclude from justification not imputation of righteousnesse which alwayes concurreth in the same act with remission of sinne and without which there can be no remission for by the same act of imputation of christs whole and entire righteousnesse we have both remission of sinnes and acceptation unto life but to exclude renovation ratione justificationis from the proper nature of justification as if they had said wee are not justified both by remission and renovation as the papists teach but by remission without renovation that is in their meaning by remission onely and this is acknowledged by bellarmine himselfe as hereafter shall bee shewed
and forasmuch as by remission of sinne wee have an imputative righteousnesse for to whom the lord imputeth not sinne to him he imputeth righteousnesse without workes as the apostle proveth rom

therefore when it is said that we are justified by remission

onely and not by renovation it is all one as if wee said that wee are justified by imputation onely and not by infusion of righteousnesse

xix
their chiefe argument to prove their assertion is this
remission is as well of the sinnes of omission as of commission
as therefore he whose sinnes of commission are remitted is reputed as if hee had done nothing forbidden so whose sinnes of omission are remitted

is reputed as if hee had left undone nothing that is commanded
now hee that is reputed as if hee had neither done any thing forbidden nor left undone any thing that is commanded hee is reputed as if hee had fulfilled the whole law

answer by distinction if they consider remission of sinnes barely without imputation of righteousnesse as they must if they will make good their assertion then hee that hath onely remission of the sins both of commission and omission is freed from the guilt of both but not from the fault
for notwithstanding such remission of his sinnes he is a sinner as having both committed what is forbidden and also omitted what is commanded
yet by remission or not imputation of sinne hee is freed from the punishment and a ratu poenae from the guilt binding over to punishment as if hee had neither committed any thing forbidden nor omitted any thing commanded
hee therefore that hth remission is reputed as having neither committed any evill nor omitted any good not simply or absolutely but in respect of the punishment and the guilt which bindeth over to punishment
as for example a maleactour being convicted of felony is by the kings pardon acquitted both from the punishment and the guilt binding him over to punishment but yet notwithstanding his fault remaineth nd for all his pardon hee is a theefe
but if they conceive of remission of sinn as having the imputation of righteousnesse concurring with it as alwaies it happeneth in gods justification of a sinner then it is true that he to whom his sinnes are remitted that is to whom sinne is not imputed and righteousnesse is imputed is reputed simply and absolutely as if he had neither committed any thing forbidden nor omitted any thing commanded but as if he had fulfilled the whole law
for it is not in gods pardon as it is in mens a man by his pardon may remit the punishment and the guilt binding over to punishment but hee cannot take away the fault neither can hee by his pardon make the offendor just
but whom god doth justifie hee maketh them righteous by imputation of christs righteousnesse whereby hee doth not onely free them from the guilt of sinne and damnation but also covering their fault he accepteth ye constituteth them righteous and heires of eternall life
for gods judgement is according to truth and therefore hee justifieth none but such as are just though not by righteousnesse inherent for so none

are or can bee justified yet by righteousnesse imputed
iustification therefore is not onely an acquiing of a sinner from punishment by the not imputing of sinne but also an accpting of him to life by imputation of perfect righteousnesse not onely a freeing of a man from hell but also the entituling of him to not onely a forgiving of our debt which christ our surety hath paid for us but also an enriching of us with the inestimabl of christs most pfect righteousnesse

xx
to this argument some doe adde a second not unlike whosoever

are innocent they are just by remission of sinnes men are innocent therefore by remission of sinnes men are just
answ
the proposition

is not generally and necessarily true for wee may conceive a man to bee innocent who is not just for innocency is but an absence of sinne not importing a presence of righteousnesse
infants if they were cleare from originall sinne were innocent but not just
to the assumption answer that by the bare remission of sinnes without imputation of righteousnesse men are not innocent for bare remission is like to a kings pardon which taketh away the punishment but not the fault
but if they speake of remission of sinne accompanied with imputation of christs righteousnesse then will confesse that by remission of sinne men are made both innocent and just
but that righteousnesse imputed which shall make a man just must not stand in suffering onely but in an universall conformity with the law of god
you have heard our arguments and their answers now let us examine their proofes

xxi
the principall authour of this novelty hath three arguments

the first is this whereby we have entrance into heaven thereby

alone we are justified by the blood of christ wee have entrance into heaven therefore by the blood of christ alone wee are justified
answ
the proposition if it had beene propounded thus by what wee have entrance into heaven by that wee are justified or thus by what alone we have entrance into heaven by that alone wee are justified had been true but as it is propounded it is false for we have entrance into heaven by his resurrection ascension and intercession not to speake of his obedience by which notwithstanding wee are as the apostle saith justified and entituled to heaven yet we are not justified by any of these alone
if his meaning be that by the blood alone of christ we have entrance into heaven the assumption also is false unlesse hee either by a synecdoche doe under one principall include all the merits of christ or exclude all other meanes out of christ who is our onely saviour

his second argument sablata privatione ponitur habitus therefore sinne being remitted and taken away justice followeth of its owne accord

to which answer briefly that neither the punishment nor the guilt which onely as themselves teach are taken away in justification are privations nor the justice which is acquired is an habit in the party justified and therefore that logicall axiome doth not serve his turne

his third argument if we are justified onely by remission of sinnes

then not by that righteousnesse which is in christ but we are justified onely by remission of sinnes
answ
the consequence of the proposition is unsound for although wee were justified by remission of sinnes alone yet wee were justified by imputation of christs passive obedience at the least unto remission of sinnes
the assumption hee proveth first by this reason because otherwise our sinnes being remitted wee should still remaine accursed
answ
it followeth not for together with remission of sinnes by imputation of christs sufferings concurreth acceptation unto life by imputation of christs obedience without which we could not be said to have fulfilled the law in christ
secondly by

the authority of calvin whom in this case these men abuse worse than the papists

though he object against calvin as these men doe that he placeth justification onely in remission of sinnes yet he consesseth

that his meaning thereby was not to exclude imputation of christs righteousnesse but renovation or sanctification
and he citeth these words out of

calvins institutions that hee placeth justification in peccatorum remissione justitiae christi imputatione in the remission of sinnes and imputation of christs righteousnesse
and againe

that god when he doth justifie us he doth absolve us by imputation of righteousnesse that in christ wee may be accepted as just who in our selves are not
wherefore saith hee when calvin in the same chapter

and
and in his antidote unto the councell of trent sess
doth contend that justification consisteth only in remission of sinnes he doth not exclude the imputation of christs righteousnesse but inward renovation and sanctification
the same bellarmine confesseth

that those whom he calleth lutherans
who indeed are very sound in this point doe all of them place justification in the imputation of christs righteousnesse which assertion of theirs is most true because by imputation of christs righteousnesse wee have not onely remission sinnes but also acceptation unto life as being righteous in christ not onely freedome from hell but also right and title to the kingdome of heaven

xxii
another treating of this point affirmeth that christ is the

matter of our justification and is made righteousnesse unto us in his passive obedience onely and yet confesseth that both the holinesse of his person and the obedience of his life are necessarily required that he might be meet to become our righteousnesse in his sufferings
but this is frivolous because as noted before he being perfect god as well as perfect man had beene in his sufferings an satisfaction for our sinnes though hee had never submitted himselfe to the obedience of the law
but the divine nature of the sonne of god and the dignity of his person as it made his sufferings satisfactory for our sinnes to redeeme us from hell because they were the sufferings of god the blood of god so it made his obedience meritorious to constitute and make us righteous and to make us heires of eternall life because it was the obedience or righteousnesse of god
for the sonne of god was made under

the law that he might not onely redeeme us who were under the law by his sufferings but also that by his meritorious obedience we might receive the adoption of sonnes
but he proveth christ to bee our righteousnesse onely in his passive obedience because it onely was both prefigured in the types and figures of the law and also represented in the sacraments
as touching the types and figures of the law which prefigured christ they were either figures of his person and office or they represented his benefits as namely and especially justification or anctification
and those which figured his benefit of justification either represented the remission of sinne by his sufferings or acceptation

with god by his obedience or both
the ceremony of

changing their clothes when they were to come before god did import that those who desired to please god must be clothed with christs righteousnesse which is also signified by the wedding

garment and the holy attire wherein the priests were to appeare before god

the high priests wearing of the golden plate with this inscription

holinesse of the lord who is iehovah

our righteousnesse was to this end that the iniquity of the holy things which the children of israel should hallow in all their holy gifts being taken away they might bee accepted before the lord
the high priests offering of incense upon the golden altar resembled the pleasing obedience of christ in his life and death and his intercession for us
the arke of the covenant was a type of christ the mediator the cover upon it of his propitiation the tables of covenant within it of his fulfilling the law for us
the sanctification of the first fruits which were a type of christ who is the first fruits of all that shall bee saved cor

was imputed to the whole increase or store rom

so aith

athanasius undefined span alphabet that the fulfilling of the law performed by the first fruits so he calleth the flesh of christ is imputed to the whole lumpe

xxiii
but come we to the sacraments which hee truely saith

are the soules of that righteousnesse

which is by faith
and yet saith he baptisme signifieth onely the washing of the soule by the bloud of christ the eucharist representeth onely his body broken and his blood shed for our sinnes
answ
though some parts onely of the benefits of christ are represented in the severall sacraments yet the substance of each sacrament is the participation of christ wholly with all his merits and benefits
thus in baptisme we are incorporated into christ and in it we put on

christ who is our righteousnesse
and it is the sacrament not only of remission of sinne and of justification but also of regeneration and sanctification we being therein conformed to his death and resurrection rom

in the lords supper we have communion with christ being not only united to him as

bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh but also have communion with him both in his merits by imputation and in his graces by influence from him as our head
other arguments are used by the same authour but because in them he taketh two things for granted which hee cannot prove the one that justification consisteth onely in remission of sin the other that wee ascribe remission of sinne to christs active obedience will not trouble the reader with them
onely let him call to minde the errours which the authors of this opinion doe runne into for the defence thereof
first that remission of sinnes is the matter of justification which is imputed to us
secondly that the law is fully satisfied by bearing the penalty alone
thirdly that by one act of obedience we are made just as wee were by one act of disobedience made sinners
fourthly that neither by his disobedience adm did transgresse the law nor christ by his obedience unto death obey it
fifthly

that christ obeyed the law not for us but for himselfe
sixthly that justification consisteth wholly and onely in remission of sinnes
which being for the most part consequents of this opinion doe prove the antecedent to be false

cap that the formall cause of iustification is the imputation of christs righteousnesse


you have heard the private opinions of some of our divines

concerning the matter of justification now let us examine the unsound opinions of some others concerning the forme
for as the former made remission of sins the matter which is imputed to justification so these make it the forme
and as the former teach that justification consisteth wholly in remission of sinne so doe these
and yet the former hold it to bee but the matter and these but the forme
indeed if it were both the matter and the forme they might well say that justification doth wholly consist therein
but being according to their owne conceipt but the one or the other and according to the truth neither of both but an effect of the true forme for by imputation of righteousnesse we have remission of sinne their opinion must needs be unsound
but the thing wherein chiefely they erre is that with

socinu the heretike they deny the imputation of christs righteousnesse and consequently do hold that neither the active nor passive obedience of christ is that which is imputed to us for righteousnesse
what then forsooth the act of faith
of these mens errour shall not need to say much in this place because besides that which hath already beene delivered in the third chapter have plentifully and fully proved in my whole fourth booke that the righteousnesse of christ is the matter which is imputed to justification and in my whole fifth booke that the imputation of christs righteousnesse is the forme of justification
only will note their depravation of our doctrine and point at their errours

ii
as touching the former when we say that the imputation of

christs righteousnesse is the formall cause of justification because by imputation of christs righteousnesse god doth justifie us they will

needs with the papists make us hold that we are formally righteous by that righteousnesse which is not in us but out of us in christ which is absurd for as themselves expound the phrase

formall justice consisteth either in the qualities of the soule or in good actions that is it is either habituall or actuall so that it cannot stand in imputation by which wee can

no more be just formally than wife rich alive by imputation of wisedome riches and life
wherefore marvell how they could be so absurd as to conceive so absurdly of us
but wee teach that christs righteousnesse both habituall and actuall by which he was formally just is the matter and the imputation thereof is the forme of justification
and so those very authors upon whom they would father this assertion in expresse termes doe teach affirming that christs obedience or fulfilling of the law is the

materiall cause of justification and the application or imputation thereof is the

formall cause of justification
we say then that the righteousnesse of christ it selfe is not the formall cause of justification or that by which we are formally just but the imputation of it it selfe being the matter of justification that is to say that thing which unto justification is imputed
wherefore shall not need to answere in defence of our assertion the arguments either of those veteratores the papists or these novatores who both agree in this calumniation against us all tending to prove that wee are not formally ju by that righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him which we doe not hold
for the righteousnesse whereby a man is formaly just is inherent in himselfe for what is more intrinsecall than the forme but christs righteousnesse is not inherent in us no more than our sinne was inherent in him
and yet as he was made sinne or a sinner by our sinnes not formally god forbid but by imputation so wee are made righteous by his righteousnesse not formally as we are justified or in our selves but in him viz by imputation
and againe as by adams actuall transgrssion which was transient and now hath no being we are made sinners that is guilty of sinne and damnation by imputation of his disobedience so likewise by christs obedience which hee performed in the daies of his flesh and was proper to his owne person we are justified that is not onely freed from the guilt of sinne and damnation but also constituted just and entituled to the kingdome of heaven
and yet we deny not but that as they to whom the guilt of adams transgression is imputed are also by sinne inherent transfused from him by carnall generation formally made sinners so they to whom the obedience of christ is imputed unto justification are also made formally just by an inchoated righteousnesse received by influence from christ and infused by his spirit in their spirituall regeneration

iii
in their opinion it selfe denying the imputation of christs

righteousnesse to justification they erre more dangerously than the papists who are forced to confesse the imputation of christs satisfaction for the maintenance of this maine errour they hold sixe others
first that remission of sinne is the entire forme or formall cause of justification
secondly that justification is nothing else but remission of sinne
thirdly that no other righteousnesse concurreth to justification besides the remission of sinne no not the righteousnesse of christ otherwise than it doth merit remission of sinne
fourthly that the righteousnesse by which we are justified is not the righteousnesse

of christ it selfe but a righteousnesse purchased by the death of christ viz remission of sinne
fifthly that not the obedience of christ it selfe is imputed whether active or passive but the merit therof
sixthly that not the righteousnesse of christ but the act of faith is imputed for righteousnesse
all which before saw the booke wherein these errours are broached had plainely and fully confuted in this treatise

iv
for as touching the two first and the maine errour it selfe

have proved both in the third chapter of this booke

briefly and in the whole fifth booke at large that the forme of justification is the imputation of christs righteousnesse by which we are both absolved from our sinnes and also are in christ accepted and made righteous and consequently that these two are the essentiall parts of

justification viz the not imputing or remission of sinne which god doth grant by imputation of christs sufferings in respect whereof wee are said to be justified by his

blood that is freed from the guilt of sinne and damnation and the imputation of christs

obedience by which wee are made or constituted righteous and are entituled to the kingdome of heaven
so that remission of sinne is not the forme and much lesse the entire forme of justification considered as an action of god but an effect of the forme because by imputation of christs righteousnesse we have remission of sinne
neither is it the whole benefit of justification but a part thereof
for although many of our divines as hath beene said have taught that unto justification remission of sinnes is onely required yet their assertion as hath also beene shewed is to be understood as bellarmine himselfe understandeth calvin as spoken in opposition to the papists who say that to justification concurre not onely remission of sinnes but also inward renovation or sanctification
to contradict them our divines have said that wee are justified by remission onely or not imputing of sinne wherewith alwayes concurreth imputation of righteousnesse and not by renovation or sanctification
their meaning therefore by the exclusive particle onely was to exclude not imputation of righteousnesse which unseparably accompanieth the not imputing of sinne as saint paul proveth rom



and bellarmine himselfe confesseth but infusion of righteousnesse or renovation


the third is the same in effect with that which fully confuted

cap

and contradicteth their owne assertion who teach with us that we are justified by the whole course of christs obedience for remission of sin is properly ascribed to christs sufferings or his blood

which cleanseth us from all our sinnes and not to his active obedience
and justification is nothing as they say but remission of sinne whereupon it would follow that we are justified onely by chrits passive obedience which have already disproved

vi
the fourth denying the righteousnesse of christ it selfe to be our righteousnesse have fully confuted in the fourth booke besides that which hath already beene alledged in the third chapter of

this book that which is added concerning a righteousnesse purchased by the death of christ is the same with that which confuted chap


for our righteousnesse is not remission of sinne but that by which wee have remission not justification it selfe but that by which wee are justified
for remission of sinne as well as justification it selfe is an action of god not imputing sinne and imputing righteousnesse and therefore is not that righteousnesse which is imputed
thus therefore argue by what we have remission of sinne by that wee are justified and by what we are justified that is our righteousnesse by the bloud of christ we have remission of sinne and not by that righteousnesse which is purchased by his blood viz remission of sinne for that to say were very ridiculous
wherefore by the blood of christ we are justified and consequently that with the res of his obedience is our righteousnesse


vii
to the fifth answer that the meritorious obedience of

christ both active and passive are the merits of christ
if therefore the merit of christ be imputed then his meritorious obedience neither can the merit of christs obedience be imputed to us unlesse the obedience it selfe be imputed and by imputation accepted of god for us as performed by our selves

for as the guilt of adams transgression could not be imputed to us unlesse the transgression it selfe were first imputed and made ours by imputation whereof wee are made sinners that is guilty of his sinne unto condemnation so the merit of christs obedience cannot bee imputed unlesse the obedience it selfe be imputed and made ours by imputation whereof we are freed from the guilt of sinne and damnation and are accepted as righteous and as heires of eternall life
and as it may truely be said of them to whom adams disobedience is imputed that they sinned in adam so of them to whom christs obedience is imputed it may no lesse truely be said that in christ they have satisfied the justice of god in christ they have fulfilled the law the lord accepting of the obedience of christ in their behalfe as if they had performed it in their owne persons
for christ is the end the perfection and complement of the law to all that beleeve
so that whosoever truely beleeveth in christ hath in him fulfilled the law as the greeke expositors expound that place rom



viii
but say they we were not so in christ when he obeied

as we were in adam when he sinned
neither are wee members of christ untill we actually beleeve
and therefore neither could we be said to have satisfied the justice of god for our sinnes nor to have fulfilled the law in him as we are truely said to have sinned in adam
or if it could be said that in christ we satisfied gods justice for our sinnes then should we need no pardon
neither can punishment and pardon stand together if wee have borne the punishment then are we not pardoned
asw
the first adam was a

type of the second and both were heads and roots of mankinde
adam of those that shall bee condemned christ of those that shall be saved
for as in adam all dye

that dye eternally so in christ all live that live eternally
and as in adam

undefined span alphabet that is all that shall be condemned were constituted sinners his disobedience being imputed to them because in him they sinned so in christ undefined span alphabet all that shall be saved shall be constituted just his obedience being imputed to them because in him as their head they have satisfied and fulfilled the law
neither are wee more truely derived from adam in respect of the life naturall than wee are from christ in respect of the life spirituall
therefore if adams disobedience were imputed to condemnation much more christs obedience is imputed unto justification of life as the apostle

argueth rom
and from thence bernard

cur non aliunde justitia cum aliunde reatus alius qui peccatorem constituit alius qui justificat peccato
alter in semine alter in sanguine
an peccatum in semine peccatoris non justitia in christi sanguine


ix yea but then say they when christ obeyed we were not

his members no more say were we the branches of the first adam when he disobeied
actually we are neither branches of the first adam untill we partake the humane nature by generation nor members of the second adam untill we be made partakers of the divine

nature by regeneration and yet it is most true which bernard avoucheth in the place even now cited satisfecit

ergo caput pro membris the head therefore satisfied for his members


yea but our faith relyeth upon christ as having already

redeemed us

ans christ is the lambe

of god slaine from the beginning of the world
the vertue of whose obedience is extended not onely to them that come after christ but also to all the faithfull that went before from the beginning of the world who were members

of christ as much as we are now
and for them as well as for us christ obeyed the law and suffered death and to them so many as beleeved was the obedience of christ imputed

as well as to us
they all did eate the same

spirituall meat and did all drinke the same spirituall drinke
for they dranke of that spirituall rocke which followed and that rocke was christ


xi
but if in christ say they we satisfied the punishment then

we need no pardon

answ
when wee say that in christ wee satisfied and fulfilled the law our meaning is that his satisfaction and obedience is imputed to us that is it is accepted of god in our behalfe as if wee had performed the same in our owne persons
neither should it seeme strange that satisfaction and pardon may stand together seeing god pardoneth no sinne for which his justice is not satisfied
but it is christ that satisfied bare the punishment and we are they who are pardoned by imputation of his satisfaction unto us
here therefore especially mercy and justice met together justice executed upon christs mercy exhibited to us who are justified by the grace of god freely

in respect of us through the redemption that is in christ iesus and therfore not freely in

respect of him who paid so great a price
for him god set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud to declare his righteousnesse for the remission of sinnes
but that the righteousnesse of christ is the onely thing which properly is imputed to justification have at large disputed lib



xii
the sixth have already refuted lib
cap



whereunto now adde that these men confessing the truth with us that faith

is the instrumentall cause of justification confute themselves
for if it be the instrument to receive that which is imputed then is it not the thing it selfe which is imputed properly though relatively it may in respect of the object which it as the instrument or hand doth receive to justification and that is the righteousnesse of christ
and for this cause as hereafter

shall bee declared the same benefits which wee have from christ properly are attributed to faith not absolutely in regard of it selfe but relatively in respect of that righteousnesse which it doth apprehend
if it be said that faith as the instrument receiveth remission of sinne because by it we are assured thereof answer that by faith receiving christ we have remission of sinnes and justification before we can by speciall faith be assured of it
and it is a great absurdity as elsewhere

have shewed to teach that men must beleeve and be assured of the remission of their sinnes to the end that they may be remitted


xiii
shall not need therefore to say any more in this place

unlesse it be to give a caveat to all young divines that they give no credit to these novelties which either affirme that wee are justified by the passive righteousnesse of christ onely or deny that wee are justified by the righteousnesse of christ at all as the matter of our justification
by matter understand that very thing which is imputed as our onely righteousnesse by which wee stand perfectly righteous before god by imputation whereof we are both freed from hell and also entituled to the kingdome of heaven
and let all men take notice that these opinions howsoever to some they seeme matters of small importance are notwithstanding very dangerous if not pernicious seeing they concerne our very title to the kingdome of heaven and seeing alo have proved in this treatise that without imputation of christs

righteousnesse there can be no justification nor salvation
for all will confesse that without christs obedience and sufferings none can bee justified or saved and that they justifie or save none but them onely to whom they are communicated and applyed
but they cannot be communicated otherwise than by imputation whereby god accepteth them in our behalfe as if we had in our owne persons performed them for our selves
againe these foure assertions hold for undoubted truthes first that what christ our blessed saviour in the daies of his flesh did or suffered in obedience to god he did and suffered not for himselfe but for us secondly that whatsoever he did and suffered for us that beleeve that the lord accepteth in the behalfe of all that beleeve thirdly that what he accepteth in our behalfe that he imputeth unto us

for by imputation wee meane nothing else fourthly to say that what christ did and suffered for us god doth not accept in our behalfe is both blasphemous against christ the wisedome of his father as if hee did and suffered those things which he did and suffered in vaine and also pernicious unto us for if christs doings and sufferings for us bee in vaine as they are if they bee not imputed to us then is our faith vaine and wee remaine in our sinnes and in the wofull state of damnation


xiv
but some will say it is sufficient to beleeve that by the

merits of christ we have remission of sinne and that having remission of sinnes we shall be saved by him
answ
yea but god forgiveth no sinnes for which his justice is not fully satisfied
for as he is mercifull so he is just in forgiving our sinnes
but no such satisfaction can bee imagined but that of christ
for we our selves are not able to satisfie for our sinnes but by eternall punishment
and how shall we have remission by christs satisfaction if it be not applyed and communicated unto us how can it be communicated and made ours but by imputation and that the very papists themselves are at length forced to confesse
and where they say that having remission of sinnes they shall be saved confesse it is true because with gods remission of sinnes there doth alwayes concurre imputation of righteousnesse
but the bare remission of sinne without imputation of righteousnesse which onely freeth a man from the guilt of sinne and damnation doth not entitle him or give him right to the kingdome of heaven
it is one thing to have by faith remission of sinnes and another to have by faith inheritance among them that be sanctified act


eternall life is not to bee

had without perfect fulfilling of the law which is no where to bee found but onely in christ
and therefore by the onely meritorious obedience of christ by which he hath merited and purchased salvation for us wee are saved
but how should we be saved by his obedience if it be not communicated unto us and made ours for our selves how can it bee made ours but by imputation wherefore no imputation of christs obedience no salvation

cap vi
the end or finall cause the essentiall parts the fruits and consequents of justification



the finall cause or end for which god doth justifie a

sinner by imputation of christs righteousnesse is either supreme or subordinate
the supreme is the manifestation of the glory both of his mercy and of his justice as is noted in the definition which as they doe concurre in all the worke of god psalm



so especially in the worke of redemption and justification
for therein the mercy of god appeareth to be so great that rather than hee would suffer us most miserable sinners to perish in our sinnes he hath sent his owne and his only begotten son that we might be justified

freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ iesus to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein hee hath made us

accepted in his beloved
his justice also such that rather than hee would suffer the sinnes of his owne elect to goe unpunished or forgive them without due satisfaction hee hath punished them in his owne sonne and exacted from him a full satisfaction for them having set him forth

to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud to declare his righteousnesse through the forgivenesse of sinnes which are past by the sufferance of god to demonstrate say his righteousnesse at this time that hee might be just and the justifier of him who beleeveth in iesus
not unto us therefore not unto us as if we were justified by our owne righteousnesse or worthinesse but

to the name of god all glory is due for his mercy and for his righteousnesse sake who doth justifie us not of workes

lest wee should glory in our selves but of his grace freely without any desert or cause in our selves through the redemption wrought by christ who is of god made righteousnesse

unto us that he which gloryeth may glory in the lord


ii
the subordinate end is our salvation and the way unto it

which is our new obedience or sanctification
salvation though it bee

our undefined span alphabet our particular supreme end and chiefe good unto which both justification and sanctification is referred yet it is subordinate to the glory of god as to the soveraigne and universall end
for such is gods goodnesse towards his elect that hee hath subordinated our salvation to his owne glory as he hath our justification and sanctification to both
and therefore as we are first above all things to desire that god may bee

glorified so that hee may bee glorified wee are first

among those things which wee desire for our owne good to seeke his

kingdome and his righteousnesse that his kingdome of glory and the kingdome of grace which consisteth in the

righteousnesse of justification and the two companions thereof peace and joy in the holy ghost may come upon us and next that his will may be done upon earth as it is in heaven by our new obedience for this is the will of god

even our sanctification
salvation say is the end both of our justification and sanctification for being made free from sinne· and become servants to

god we have our fruit unto holinesse and the end everlasting life
the end of our faith by which we are justified is the

salvation of our soules unto which by justification wee are entituled and

saved in hope that being justified by his

grace wee should bee made heires according to hope of eternall life for all that be justified

shall be glorified
and this also noted in the definition when said that those whom the lord doth justifie by imputation of christs righteousnesse he accepteth as righteous in christ and as heires of eternall life for by faith

we have remission of sinnes and inheritance among them that are sanctified

iii
but we are justified by faith not onely that in the end wee

may be saved but also that in the meane time our salvation being of grace might be certaine and sure and that being justified

by faith we might have peace and joy in the holy ghost whereas if it depended upon our workes or worthinesse it would be uncertaine
for the promise of this inheritance was not made to abraham and his seed through the law in respect of any righteousnesse therein prescribed but through the righteousnesse of faith
and therefore it is of faith that it might bee by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all

the seed rom



iv
the other end which is subordinate not onely to gods glory

but also to our salvation is our sanctification as being the way to eternall life for though we be saved by grace through faith and not of workes yet we are the workmanship

of god created in christ iesus unto good workes which god hath before ordained that we should walke in them we are therefore justified first that god may be glorified
secondly that wee may bee saved in the life to come
thirdly that in this world we may lead a godly life

so much of the causes


there remaine the essentiall parts of justification which expressed

in the definition when said that god doth justifie a beleeving sinner when imputing unto him the righteousnesse of christ he doth absolve him from his sinnes and accepteth of him in christ as righteous and as an heire of eternall life

the parts therefore of justification are two absolution from sinne and acceptation as righteous in christ both which the lord granteth by imputation of the full and perfect satisfaction of christ whereby he fully satisfied the law both in respect of the penalty which he satisfied by his sufferings and also in respect of the precept which he satisfied

by his perfect righteousnesse both habituall and actuall
as therefore there were two branches of the law to be satisfied the commination and the commandement and two parts of christs satisfaction answerable thereunto so there are two parts of justification absolution from the curse of the law by imputation of christs sufferings wherein he became a curse for us and acceptation as righteous in christ by imputation of christs most perfect righteousnes both habituall actuall in respect of both which parts of his satisfaction christ is the end of the law for righteousnes

that is doth justifie all that truly beleeve in him

vi
and hereby it may appeare that those three benefits of redemption reconciliation and adoption are all comprehended under

this maine benefit of justification the two former being all one in substance with the former part for as touching the former in christ wee have redemption through his bloud

even remission of sinnes eph

col

and as touching the latter god was in christ

reconciling the world unto himselfe not imputing unto them or remitting their sinnes cor

and therefore all three remission of

sinnes

redemption and

reconciliation are ascribed to the bloud and to the death of christ
the third is all one in substance with the second part for what is it to be adopted but to be accepted of god

in his beloved as righteous and as an heire of eternall life and this is ascribed to the righteousnesse and obedience of christ

both in his life and death
for therefore was the sonne of god made under the

law namely to obey and to fulfill and to satisfie it that hee redeeming us from the yoke of the law requiring perfect obedience in us to justification we might receive the adoption of sonnes

vii
now follow the consequents and fruits of justification which

are the grace of sanctification and the parts therof consisting partly in righteousnesse inherent and partly in outward obedience called good workes which doe the rather mention in this place because the papists though they cannot deny that they are the effects and fruits of justification which as they use to alleage out of augustine non praecedunt justificandum sed sequuntur justificatum not goe before as causes but follow as effects yet notwithstanding most absurdly contend that they concurre with faith unto justification as the causes thereof wee acknowledge them to be necessary in the subject that is the party that is justified and to bee saved necessitate praesentiae as the necessary fruits and consequents of justification and as necessary antecedents to glorification but we deny their necessity of efficiencie as causes concurring to the act of justification or merit of salvation we acknowledge them as the necessary fruits of redemption and iustification as the markes and cognizances of them that shall be saved the necessary forerunners of glorification the onely true way to our heavenly countrey the evidence according to which wee shall be judged at the last day yet we are not justified by them nor saved for them as hereafter shall plainely and plentifully prove but onely by and for the righteousnesse and merits of christ apprehended by faith

a treatise of ivstification
the second booke that justification and sanctification are not to bee confounded
cap setting downe the heads of the controversies the first whereof is that iustification and sanctification are not to be confounded
the first proofe because the hebrew word which signifieth to justifie doth never signifie to make righteous by infusion of righteousnesse


having thus briefely set downe the true doctrine

of iustification according to the word of god we are now to confute the erroneous doctrine of of the papists
there are six maine and capitall errours which the papists most obstinately hold and maintaine concerning justification and consequently so many principall heads of controversie betweene us whereunto divers other particular questions are to be reduced
the first concerning the name whether justification and sanctification are to bee confounded
the second concerning the moving cause which is the justifying and saving grace of god which they call gratia gratum faciens
the third concerning the matter of justification
the fourth concerning the forme
the fifth concerning the instrumentall cause which is faith
the sixth concerning the fruits of faith and consequents of justification which are good workes concerning which are two maine questions

first whether they doe justifie a man before god
secondly whether they doe merit eternall life

ii
the first capitall errour of the papists is that they confound

justification and sanctification and by confounding of them and of two benefits making but one they utterly abolish as shall be shewed the benefit of justification which notwithstanding is the principall benefit which we have by christ in this life by which wee are freed from hell and entituled to the kingdome of heaven
and this they doe in two respects for first they hold that to justifie in this question signifieth to make righteous by righteousnesse inherent or by infusion of righteousnesse that is to sanctifie
secondly they make remission of sinne not to be the pardoning and forgiving of sinne but the utter deletion or expulsion of sinne by infusion of righteousnèsse
thus they make justification wholly to consist in the parts of sanctification
for whereas sanctification is partly privative which is the taking away of sinne which we according to the scriptures call mortification and partly positive which we call vivification and is partly inward or habituall consisting in the habits of grace infused and partly actuall which is our new obedience and practice of good workes all these and onely these they make to concurre to justification which with them is partly privative which they call remission of sinne whereby they understand the utter deletion or extinction of sinne wrought by infusion of perfect righteousnesse which is an higher degree of mortification than we can attaine unto in this life and partly positive and that either habituall which they call their first justification wherein a man of a sinner is made righteous by infusion of the habits of grace which is indeed regeneration and partly actuall which they call their second justification wherein a righteous man is made more just by the practice of good works whereby they merit not onely the increase of righteousnesse but also the crowne of eternall life

iii
of this first controversie therefore are two questions first

whether to justifie doth signifie to make righteous by infusion of righteousnesse which is to sanctifie
secondly whether remission of sinne be the utter deletion and abolition of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse
in both the papists hold the affirmative
the former which is a most pernicious errour they ground upon the like notation of the latine words to justifie and to sanctifie
that as to sanctifie is to make holy by holinesse inherent so to justifie is to make just by infusion of righteousnesse
but though the notation of the latine words were to be respected yet no more could be inforced from thence but that to justifie is to make just
and that is all which

bellarmine goeth about to prove
now god maketh men just two wayes by imputation as he justifieth by infusion as he sanctifieth them
for if a man may bee made just not only inwardly by obtaining righteousnesse but also outwardly by declaration as

bellarmine himselfe saith then much more by imputation even as we were made sinners by adams actuall transgression and as christ was made sinne that is a sinner for us
for

even as by adams disobedience wee were made sinners and guilty of damnation his transgression being imputed to us so

are wee made just by the obedience of christ imputed to us
and as christ who knew no sinne was made a sinner by imputation of our sinnes to him so

we are made the righteousnesse of god in him that is righteous in him by the imputation of his righteousnesse who is god unto us
but indeed the force of the latine words is to be respected no further than as they are the true translation of the hebrew word in the old testament and of the greeke in the new

the passive is onely once used dan


where it is said that the

is used in the doctrine of justification but as it signifieth either to arrogate righteousnesse to a mans selfe as iob

or to attribute or ascribe it to others as iob

or to shew himselfe or others righteous as ier

ezek


in the third conjugation it signifieth to justifie in that sense that the

question of justification and it is verbum forense a judiciall word used in courts of judgement which usually is opposed to condemning
and it signifieth to absolve and to acquit from guilt and accepting a man as righteous to pronounce him just or to give sentence with him

there remaineth the fourth conjugation importing a reciprocall

signification in which the word is once only used gen

how shall we justifie our selves


vi
these are all the places wherein fide this word to bee

used in the old testament
by all which it doth evidently appeare that the hebrew word which signifieth to justifie doth never signifie to make righteous by infusion of righteousnesse or by righteousnesse inherent the which will more clearely appeare by the countrary for as to condemne is to make wicked so to justifie is to make just
the word rashah signifieth to be wicked as tsadaq doth signifie to be just so hirshiah which signifieth to make wicked is to condemne as hitsdiq which signifieth to make just is to justifie
as therefore they who are condemned are said to be made wicked or unjust namely by sentence so they who are justified are said to be made just viz by sentence
but he that condemneth the wicked whether it be god or man though he be said according to the force of the word to make him wicked yet doth not make him wicked formally or by infusion of wickednesse inherent
therefore he that justifieth a man whether he be god or man though he be said according to the etymologie of the word to make him just yet quatenus justificat he doth not make him just as hee justifieth him by righteousnesse inherent
no more than hee that condemneth the just doth make him formally wicked nor hee that justifieth the wicked doth make him formally just which if a man should doe it would be no abomination to god as by he sentence of

salomon to justifie the wicked is but the contrary iam

da



vii
and not unlike hereunto is the phrase of cleansing or

polluting that is making cleane or uncleane attributed to the priest in

the

law when hee was to judge of the leprosie either in persons or things which he was said to make cleane or uncleane when he did but judge or pronounce them so to be
and further this is to be noted as a thing usuall in the hebrew tongue that the third conjugation doth seeme to make that quality or thing which is implied in the signification of the first conjugation not alwayes really and formally but many times in word onely or judgement sentence or conceit
thus gadal signifieth to be great higdil to make great or to magnifie which is in words to extoll in which sense we are said to magnifie

god
so aman signifieth to be true heemin to make true that is to beleeve as contrariwise not to beleeve a man is to make him a liar

and yet a man may beleeve

a lye which he cannot make true
thus rashah signifieth to be wicked hirshuah to make wicked by sentence and so tsadaq signifieth to be just and hitsdiq to make just namely by sentence
and such is the ordinary use of divers latine and english words of the like composition as to glorifie magnifie vilifie nullifie as herod

did christ and so to justifie for as we are said to justifie

god when wee ascribe righteousnesse unto him to justifie other men to justifie our selves so god is said to justifie men when he ascribeth or imputeth

righteousnesse unto them

cap ii
the use of the greeke words signifying to justifie or justification never importing inherent justice



the greeke words which signifie to justifie and to be

justified are undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet from whence are derived undefined span alphabet which signifieth justification and undefined span alphabet which sometimes also signifieth justification
and of these am now to speake undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet are not in use among the authors of the greeke tongue in the sense of justifying or making just
undefined span alphabet saith suidas undefined span alphabet it signifieth two things to punish as being derived from undefined span alphabet which sometimes signifieth punishment and to thinke right or meet sometimes both undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet doe signifie to condemne in the contrary sense to the sacred use of the words sometimes undefined span alphabet signifieth onely to thinke to judge or suppose and undefined span alphabet sometime to bee righted in judgement
from prophane authors therefore wee are not to setch the true meaning of the words but from the septuagints who translating the hebrew text of the old testament doe render the hebrew words which spake of importing justification by these greeke

words undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet
and from them not only the sonne of sirach and other ecclesiasticall authors writing in greeke but also the holy apostles and evangelists have received the same
and therefore these words are no otherwise to be understood than as the translations of the said hebrew words signifying no other thing than what the hebrew words import which as have shewed doe never signifie to make or to be made righteous by inherent righteousnesse


ii undefined span alphabet is used by the apostle and by the evangelist luke

sometimes as the translation of tsiddiq in piel as luk

the people

and publicans undefined span alphabet justified god
the lawyer luk


willing to justifie himselfe
the pharisies luk

justified themselves before men
and so is the word used sometimes by the sonne of sirach as ecclus


who will justifie him that sinneth against his

owne soule cap


alias
a rich man speaketh things not to be spoken and yet men justifie him
sometimes the apostle useth the word undefined span alphabet as the translation of hitsdiq as alwaies he doth in the question of justification and alwayes as the action of god as rom


who justifieth him that beleeveth in iesus how vers
gratis without any cause or desert of justification in the party without workes that is without respect of any righteousnesse inherent in him or performed by him vers
who justifieth the circumcision and uncircumcision that is both iewes and gentiles not of workes or by inherent justice but by and through faith vers
who justifieth the ungodly that is

the beleeving sinner that worketh not rom

and therefore not by inherent righteousnesse how then by imputing righteousnesse without workes vers
who rom

whom he calleth he justifieth namely

by faith and whom he justifieth hee also glorifieth using the word in the same sense vers
who can lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it is god that justifieth who shall condemne where most manifestly the word is used as a judiciall word opposed to accusing and condemning
neither can any colour of reason be alleaged why the word in these places should signifie contrary to the perpetuall use both of it selfe and of the hbrew word whereof it is a translation to make righteous by righteousnesse inherent


iii undefined span alphabet is used sometimes as the translation not of the passive

verbe but as of the neuter in cal as have shewed before out of the greeke translation of the
so ecclus


bee not just before god not wise before the king or as it is usually translated doe

not justifie thy selfe before god
so also in the new testament
rom

cited out of psalm


where the hebrew word is not a passive

but a neuter
and so apoc

undefined span alphabet let him that is

just be just still
as the translation of the passive it is often used
but as it never signifieth to be made just by inherent justice as will shew when come to answere the objections of the papists so it alwayes signifieth either to be declared or pronounced just or to bee absolved and made jus by imputation
in the former sense wisedome is said to bee justified of her children

luk

who vers
justified

god
christ who is god was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit tim


thus by our words we shall bee justied not made

just formally or by inherent righteousnesse but in the sense opposed to condemnation
for as by thy words thou shalt bee justified so by thy words thou shalt be condemned matth


thus not the hearers

alone but the doers of the law shall bee justified that is pronounced just rom

and in this sense the faithfull are justified by workes that is declared approved and knowne to bee just
iames




cum genes


the latter sense ecclesiast


alias
the famous man chap

the lover of gold chap

alias

the rash swearer shall not bee justified that is as it is in the commination of the third commandement shall not bee held guitlesse but most plainely chap
the last verse the huckster shall not bee justified

from sinne that is not absolved from sinne nor accepted as righteous
so act


where most plainely to be ustified from sinne

doth signifie to be absolved or freed from the guilt of sinne and is used promiscuously with remission of sinne
and this sense freedome from the guilt is ometimes extended to signifie a totall freedome as rom



he that is dead is justified that as chrysostome and oumenius expound it undefined span alphabet is freed from sinne
as these places are plainely repugnant to the popish sense so none of the rest where undefined span alphabet is used doth favour it
for either they import remission of sinnes and acceptation as righteos as luk

the publican who had

humbled himselfe and craved pardon went home justified that is obtained pardon and was accepted as righteous rather than the pharisee who had justified himselfe or distinguish betweene justification and sanctification as cor

or exclude justification by inherent

righteousnesse as rom

as where we are said to be justified either by his blood as rom

or by grace as ti
or both exclude the one and imply the other as rom

iv
there remaine these two words which mentioned before undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet is used onely in two placs rom



in the former it is said that christ was delivered to death for

our sinnes and was raised againe for our justifiction to whom as it is

in the precedent verse righteousnesse shall bee imputed if wee beleeve on him that raised up iesus our lord from the dead for as our saviour by his death and obedience untll death merited for us remission of sinnes and the right to eternall life so by the acts of christ restored to life as namely by his resurrection his merits are effectually applied and imputed to our justification
for if christ had not risen againe wee had beene still in our sinnes cor

in the latter place justification is in direct termes opposed to condemnation
for as by the offence or transgression of one viz the first adam undefined span alphabet the guilt which is to be supplied out of the sixteenth verse came upon all

men the offspring of the first adam undefined span alphabet unto condemnation so

by the undefined span alphabet of one whereby hee fulfilled the law viz the second adam the undefined span alphabet or free gift opposite to the guilt of damnation which is our title and right to the kingdome of heaven commeth to all men that belong to the second adam unto justification of life


the word undefined span alphabet is diversy used both in the

plurall number and in the singular
in the plurall it hath three significations for first it signifieth iura the lawes or commandements of god either in generall and indefinitely as namely where no other word of the like signication

is joyned with it as psalm


rom

or more particularly the precepts of the ceremoniall law
and this sense is most usuall when it is joyned with words signifying other lawes

or precepts
for the whole law which is called mishmereth

iehovah the observation of the lord that is all that the lord requireth to bee observed is often distinguished into three parts

mitsvoth whih the septuagint translate undefined span alphabet the commandements of the morall law mishpatim which they translate undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet the precepts of the judiciall law chuqqim which they translate sometimes undefined span alphabet and sometimes undefined span alphabet the statutes and ordinances of the ceremoniall law
insomuch that the vulgar latine for chuqqim rendreth many times even where the
have undefined span alphabet ceremonias as gen

deut















the apostle rom

calleth the morall law undefined span alphabet the iudiciall undefined span alphabet the ceremoniall undefined span alphabet and accordingly the precepts of the ceremoniall law are called heb

undefined span alphabet the ordinances of divine service and because they were but externall observations vers
undefined span alphabet carnall ordinances
secondly it signifieth the judgements of god

apoc

which by the vulgar latine and others is translated iudicia
and as undefined span alphabet sometimes signifieth the just workes of god which are the acts of his justice so in the last place some expound undefined span alphabet apoc
to bee the just workes of the saints and as the author of the homilies in saint augustine justa facta or justè facta as the greeke writers sometimes use the word which the papists will needs translate justifications meaning thereby just workes and hoping thereby to prove that men are justified by them which we deny not in that sense wherein saint iames saith we are justified that is declared and knowne to bee just by them
but if justifications bee the true translation of undefined span alphabet in that place then we are thereby to understand the merits of christ by which the saints are justified which are more fitly resembled by a garment than either inherent righteousnesse or righteous

workes
and is indeed called matth


the wedding garment which garment is put on by a true faith by which the faithfull as they are exhorted rom

put on christ
whereof baptisme is a seale gal


and this is that white garment which is to bee had from

christ to cover our nakednesse apoc

sometimes indeed the white robes doe signifie the glorious and happy estate promised to the faithfull as apoc





which is purchased by the merits of christ for which cause their robes are said to bee made white in the

blood of the lambe
but here the holy ghost expoundeth the fine linnen wherewith the saints are arrayed to bee the justifications of the saints which as said are the merits and obedience of christ put on by a true faith which being without us as garments use to be and yet being applyed unto us and put on by faith doe cover our nakednesse and therefore are more fitly resembled by fine linnen pure and shining than our owne righteousnesse which neither is without us as a garment nor yet pure but christs righteousnesse imputed is both as a garment pure and perfect in it selfe and shineth forth by the light of good works mat



vi undefined span alphabet is a verball derived from undefined span alphabet either as undefined span alphabet signifieth

to be just in which sense the precepts of god are said to bee undefined span alphabet psalm


or as it signifieth to be justified
in the former sense undefined span alphabet signifieth that which is just either as the law of god prescribing righteousnesse so the law of nature written in the hearts

of men is called undefined span alphabet
rom

or as the whole righteousnesse

which in the law is prescribed and so it is used rom

for as by the transgression of one viz the first adam whereby the whole law was violated guilt came upon all men that were in him unto condemnation so by the undefined span alphabet of one the second adam whereby he fulfilled the whole law the free gift which is our right and title to heaven came upon all men who are in him unto justification of life and rom

god sent his sonne the law being impossible to be fulfilled

by us in the likenesse of sinfull flesh that undefined span alphabet all that the law requireth to justification might in our nature bee performed

and fulfilled
in the latter sense it is once onely used viz rom

in the same signification with undefined span alphabet that is justification vers
both of them being opposed to condemnation
if therefore the words which the holy ghost doth use to expresse the benefit of justification doe never signifie justification by inherent righteousnesse but the contrary as hath beene hewed then that justification which the papists teach is not that which is taught in the holy scriptures but contrary to it


vii
and the same is proved by these two reasons first because

the apostles when they expresse the benefit of justification in other termes they doe signifie the same not by such words as import infusion of righteousnesse but by such as plainely signifie either absolution from sinne which is the not imputing of sinne or imputation of righteousnesse rom
these phrases are used to signifie one and the same thing to justifie to impute righteousnesse without works vers to remit sin to cover sins vers
not impute sin vers to be justified and to be blessed and to be blessed is to have their sins remitted or covered vers
rom
to bee justified by the blood of christ and to be reconciled

unto god by his death all one cor
to reconcile us unto himselfe not imputing our offences unto us and vers to make us the righteousnesse of god in christ as he was made sinne for us act



that by faith we may have remission of sinnes and inheritance that is that we may bee heires of the heavenly inheritance among them

that are sanctified ioh

he that beleeveth in christ undefined span alphabet is not condemned that is as paul speaketh act


is justified but hee

that beleeveth not him is condemned already
that which paul affirmeth rom

now without the law is manifested the righteousnesse

of god being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousnesse of god which is by the faith of iesus christ unto all and upon all that beleee saint peter more plainely expresseth act


unto him all the prophets beare witnesse that every one which

beleeveth in him receiveth remission of sinnes through his name


viii
because the whole processe of the justification of a sinner

is judiciall rom
for the sinner summoning himselfe before the judgement seat of god as every one must doe that would bee justified his owne conscience being rightly informed by the paedagogie of the law accuseth him the devill pleadeth against him the law convicteth him and maketh him undefined span alphabet

subject to the sentence of condemnation if god should judge him according to his law
but the sinner being instructed in the gospell and the holy ghost having opened

his heart to beleeve appealeth from the sentence of the law to the promise of the gospell and from the tribunall of justice to the throne of grace humbly intreating the lord for christs sake to pardon his sinnes and to accept of the merits and obedience of christ as a full satisfaction for them
our saviour sitting at the right hand of his father maketh intercession

and as an advocate pleadeth for him that forasmuch as he himselfe hath paid the debt and satisfied gods justice for the beleeving sinner therefore the lord not onely in mercy but also in justice is to remit his sinne and to accept of him in christ
the lord as a gracious and righteous judge imputing to the beleever the merits and righteousnesse of christ absolveth him from his sinnes and accepteth of him as righteous in christ that is to say justifieth him
the beleeving sinner being thus justified in the court of heaven is not at the first justified in the court of his owne conscience that is to say is not yet perswaded and assured of his justification untill the holy ghost by the ministery of the gospell pronouncing remission of sinnes and justification to every one that beleeveth teacheth him to apply the promises of the gospell unto himselfe which he sealeth unto him by the sacraments
the beleever being thus perswaded and in some measure assured of his justification giveth diligence by practising the duties of repentance and sanctification to confirme and increase that assurance more and more unto the end of his life labouring by all good meanes to make sure his election his vocation and his justification and so proceedeth from faith to faith
the beleever having thus beene justified in this life both in the court of heaven and in the court of his owne conscience after this life namely at the day of judgement when our saviour will judge of mens faiths according to the evidence of their works shall be justified that is pronounced happy and blessed
these

three degrees of gods most gracious proceeding with the faithfull have set downe not that there are so many degrees of justification so

properly called
for the first degree onely is that justification whereof wee treat which admitteth no degrees
the other are degrees of the declaration thereof the former privately to the conscience of the faithfull the other publikely to the whole world

cap iii
the allegations of the papists concerning the word justification the two first significations thereof assigned by bellarmine


having thus explained the true sense and meaning of

these words which in the holy scriptures are used to signifie justification let us now examine the allegations of the papists concerning the same
bellarmine therefore saith

that the word justification meaning the latine word is used foure wayes in the holy scriptures meaning the vulgar latine edition when as indeed neither the latine edition it selfe nor the latine word is in this question further to bee respected than as it is a true translation of the hebrew in the old testament and of the greeke in the new
first saith he it is taken

for the law which teacheth righteousnesse and so is used psal

will keepe thy justifications and vers
teach me thy justifications
this bellarmine barely expoundeth without any further enforcing but gregory martin

and our rhemists

urge it as a principall argument that the precepts of the law are therefore called justifications because the observation of them doth justifie us and therefore exclaime against us that in our translations wee in stead of justifications doe read statutes or ordinances
as though in translating the holy scriptures we did professe to translate the latine edition and not the original text
now the word which in the old testament is by the vulgar latine interpreted justificationes and by the
undefined span alphabet is chuqqim· which when it is used alone signifieth undefinitely any of the precepts statutes or commandements of god but being used with other words of the like signification from which it is distinguish'd signifieth the sta+tutes and ordinances of the ceremoniall law insomuch that the vulgar latine in many places even where the greek hath undefined span alphabet rendreth ceremonias a as shewed before

which though the latines sometimes call justificationes yet by the confession of the papists themselves do not justifie
and the like is to be said of luk

where zachary and elizabeth

are said to have walked in all the commandements and justifications of the lord where the greeke word is undefined span alphabet which is the translation

of chuqqim and signifieth the statutes of the ceremoniall law as being distinguished from the commandements of the morall law but of the greeke word have spoken sufficiently before chap


if therefore the force of the latine word justificationes bee urged answer that the observation of the morall law can justifie no man that is a sinner and much lesse the observation of the ceremoniall
and the conclusion which they inferre from the force of the word that the precepts of the law are called justifications because by the observation of them men are justified is directly contrary to that of the

apostle that by the workes of the law no man living is or can be justified

ii
but if they bee justifications whose are they for so they

argue if good workes say they bee the justifications of the saints then they justifie the saints
so may say if the precepts of the law be the justifications of the lord then belike they justifie him but neither are fitly called justifications though the greeke word undefined span alphabet may not unfitly be given both to the law of god as the rule of justice and to the judgements of god as the acts of justice and to the good deeds of the saints as workes of justice and also to the merits of christ

which notwithstanding doe not justifie him but us unlesse they meane that as by good workes the faithfull so by righteous commandements and just judgements god is declared and manifested to bee just
and farther the law of nature knowne to the gentiles is called

undefined span alphabet which notwithstanding doth not justifie either him or them and is by the latine interpreter unfitly translated the justice of god
and moreover bellarmine himselfe as we have heard noteth that the law is called justification because it teacheth righteousnesse and yet not that righteousnesse by which we are justified for that without the law

is manifested in the gospell being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousnesse of god which is by faith of iesus christ unto all and upon all that beleeve
but to conclude bellarmine had no reason to make this the first signification of the word in the scriptures for the hebrew word which the vulgar latine translateth sometimes iustificationes and sometimes ceremonias in the same sense doth signifie no such matter and the greeke which twice

at the most in the scriptures signifieth justification doth usually signifie the

law of god and his statutes and ordinances but more especially those of the ceremoniall law which if they be any where called justifications it is to bee imputed to the corrupt translation and not to the originall truth

iii
so much of the first signification
the two next whereof

there is no example in the scriptures hee hath coined to fit their newfound distinction of justification it selfe which they distinguish into the first and the second
the first when a man of a sinner is made just by infusion of habituall righteousnesse
the second when a just man is made more just by practise of good workes
accordingly justification saith bellarmine in the second place signifieth acquisition of righteousnesse viz inherent which is their first justification and in the third

place incrementum justitiae the encrease of justice which is their second justification which distinction if it were applied to sanctification were not to be rejected
for that which they call their first justification is the first act of our sanctification which the scriptures call eration in which the holy ghost doth ingenerate in the soule of the elect the grace of faith and with it and by it other sanctifying graces wherein their justification which is habituall consisteth
and that which they call their second justification being actuall is our new obedience by which our sanctification is continued and encreased
but to justification it cannot truly be applyed for first justification is an action of god for it is god that doth justifie
their second justification is their owne act whereby they being just already make themselves more just
secondly justification as hath been said is an action of god without

us not implying a reall mutation in us but relative such as is wrought by the sentence of a iudge and is opposed to condemnation
thirdly because it is the righteousnesse of christ by which wee are justified which is a perfect righteousnesse whereunto nothing can bee added
therefore of justification it selfe there are no degrees though of the assurance thereof there are degrees according to the measure of our faith

iv
but let us see how bellarmine proveth his second signification

to that purpose he alledgeth three testimonies of scripture which prove nothing else but that the papists have no sound proofe for their erronious conceit
the first is taken out of cor

and such were you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified
where indeed the word is used but in a sense distinguished from sanctification
the scope and intendment the apostle is to exhort the corinthians being now christians to abstaine from those sinnes whereunto they were addicted whiles they lived in gentilisme
such you were then saith the apostle but now since you gave your names to christ you were baptized into his name and in your baptisme were washed from those sinnes being sanctified from the corruption of them by the spirit of god and iustified from the guilt of them in the name of iesus christ that is by faith in his name
thus therefore these three words are to bee distinguished
the washing of the soule which is represented by the washing of the body is the generall word whereby the purging of the soule from sinne is generally signified act


but as in sinne there are two things from which we had need to be purged that is the guilt of sinne and the corruption thereof so this ablution or washing of the soule hath two parts ablution from the guilt of sinne which is our justification ablution from the corruption of sinne which is our sanctification
both which are represented and sealed in the sacrament of baptisme wherein as the outward washing of the body doth represent the inward washing of the soule both from the guilt and corruption of sinne so the element of water whereby the body is washed or sprinckled is a signe of the water and blood which issued out of christs side whereby the soule is washed that is to say the blood of redemption

and the water of sanctification for by the blood that is the merits of christ wee are freed from the guilt of sinne and by the water that is the spirit of sanctification wee are freed in some measure from the corruption
and both these as said are signified in baptisme
for wee are baptized into the remission of sinnes act


mar


our soules being washed with the blood of christ according to that in the nicene creed beleeve one baptisme for the remission of sinnes and wee are baptized unto the mortification of sinne and rising unto holinesse of life rom

our soules being washed by the water of the

holy ghost
for wee are baptized into the death of christ and similitude of his resurrection that as christ dyed and rose againe so wee that are baptized should dye unto sinne and rise to newnesse of life for which cause baptisme also is called the laver of regeneration tit



this then is the summe and effect of the apostles exhortation that seeing they having given their names unto christ had been baptized into his name and were therefore sacramentally at the least washed and consequently both in their owne profession and opinion of others judging according to charity sanctified from the corruption of sinne and justified from the guilt of the same therefore they should take heed lest they should againe bee polluted with those sinnes from which they were sanctified or made guilty of those crimes from which they were justified


his second testimony is rom

whom he hath called them

hee hath justified
answ
the context doth shew that the word in the
verse is used in the same sense as verse
for having shewed

that whom the lord calleth hee doth justifie and whom he doth justifie them also hee doth glorifie from thence hee inferreth this consolation who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it is god that justifieth as was said verse
who shall condemne
where justifying most plainely is used as a judiciall word signifying by sentence to justifie as chrysostome and ocumenius on this place doe note as opposed to accusing and condemning and cannot with any shew of reason be drawne to signifie contrary to the perpetuall use of the word infusion of righteousnesse
but heere it may bee objected that in this place where the apostle setteth downe the degrees of salvation sanctification is either included in justification or left our
answ
it is left out for the apostle setting downe the chaine of the causes of salvation in the degrees whereof every former being the cause of the latter left out sanctification as being no cause of salvation but the way unto it and the cognizance of them that are saved
and these degrees are so set downe act


where the end of the ministery is expressed first vocation that men should bee called and thereby brought to beleeve secondly iustification that by faith they may receive remission of sinnes thirdly glorification that by faith they may receive the inheritance among them that are sanctified where sanctification is mentioned onely as the cognizance of them that are saved
againe sanctification is left out because it is included in respect of

the beginning thereof which is our conversion or regeneration in vocation and in respect of the consummation in glorification for as sanctification is gloria inchoata so glorification is gratia consummata


vi
his third testimony is rom
to him that beleeveth in him

who justifieth the ungodly
ans he should have done well to have made up the sentence his faith is imputed for righteousnesse which place is so farre srom favouring the popish conceit that it plainely confutes it first it is called the justification of the ungodly that is of one who is a sinner in himselfe for he that is a sinner in himselfe by inherent sinne and so remaineth cannot be justified by righteousnesse inherent secondly because to him that beleeveth in christ faith relatively understood that is the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith is imputed for righteousnesse thirdly because in this place justification is expressed by these termes not imputing sinne remitting or covering of sinne imputing righteousnesse without workes imputing faith for righteousnesse to him that worketh not that is that seeketh not to bee justified by his owne righteousnesse but beleeveth in him that justifieth a sinner

cap iiii
the third and fourth signification of the word justification assigned by bellarmine


thirdly saith bellarmine justification is taken for increase

of justice for even as he is said to be heated not only who of cold is màde hot but also who of hot is made hotter even so he is said to be justified who not onely of a sinner is made just but also of just is made more just· ans
in this comparison of like there is a great unlikenesse for calefaction implyeth a reall mutation and a positive change in the subject from cold to hot but in justification the change is not reall but relative as before hath beene shewed
bellarmine therefore must prove that to justifie doth signifie to make righteous formally by righteousnesse inherent before he can prove that it signifieth the increase of inherent justice
but if the former cannot be proved much lesse the latter
but yet he bringeth three proofes such as they be


ii
the first ecclus


ne verearis usque ad mortem justificari

quniam merces domini manet in aeternum feare not to be justified untill death for the reward of the lord adideth for ever
answ
to omit that the booke is apocryphall which ought not to bee alleaged

in controversies of faith the testimonie it selfe is vilely depraved
the words in the originall are undefined span alphabet that is stay not untill death to be justified or as their own interlinear translation readeth

it ne expectes usque ad mortem justificari wait not untill death to be justified where it is evident that he speaketh of justification in our first conversion which he would not have differred untill the time of death and not of the continuance or increase of it for then the sentence would beare a contrary and indeed an ungodly sense undefined span alphabet abide not or continue not to be justified or to be just untill thy death
and the words untill death are not to be joyned with the last word justified but with the first stay not untill death
and their translation of the words undefined span alphabet whether as bellarmine here readeth ne verearis or as some editions have ne vetéris hath no affinity with the originall
but our interpretation as it agreeth with the words of the text so it is confirmed by the context
vse physike before thou bee sicke before judgement prepare thy thy selfe before thou bee sicke and in the time of sinnes that is whiles thou mai'st yet sinne shew thy conversion let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vowes in due season and deferre not untill death to be justified or to become just

iii
but this testimony bellarmine urgeth againe in another place

shewing that the place is to bee understood of continuing and proceeding in justice and the words undefined span alphabet are as much as cease not
and this he would prove by that which goeth before be not hindred to pray alwayes where the wise man admonisheth us to increase our justice by continuall prayer and also by that which immediately followeth because the reward of the lord endureth for ever for reward agreeth not to the first justification of the wicked but indulgence
answ
this interpretation of bellarmine may then be admitted when it shal be proved first that undefined span alphabet signifieth to cease secondly undefined span alphabet to pray thirdly undefined span alphabet alwaies fourthly that those words but the reward of the lord endureth for ever are found in the originall text
but if bellarmine knew that undefined span alphabet signifieth stay not or waite not and not cease not undefined span alphabet to render the vow and not to pray undefined span alphabet in due season and without delay and not alwayes and that the clause concerning the reward of the lord is not in the greeke text then can it not be denied but that bellarmine endevoured against his owne conscience to father his errour upon the sonne of sirach howbeit the reason which he rendreth is pharisaicall for unto the first justification saith he of sinners not reward but indulgence agreeth as though there were any reward of our righteousnesse which alwayes in this life is impure and imperfect esai

but by indulgence
if thou lord should'st marke what is amisse lord who shall stand but with thee there is mercy or indulgence that thou maist be feared psal

to them that love god and keepe his commandements the lord sheweth mercy exod
to thee lord mercie for thou reward'st a man meaning the godly man according to his works psalm


which plainely sheweth that the reward of good workes is to be ascribed to gods mercy and indulgence and not to our defect for it is

great mercy that hee pardoneth the imperfection and iniquity of our good workes greater that he accepteth of them in christ but greatest that hee graciously rewardeth them and who knoweth not that eternall life it selfe which is the reward that endureth for ever is the

free and undeserved gift of god not rendred to our merits but given of his free grace

iv
his second testimony is iam
you see then that a man is

justified by workes and not by faith onely
answ
of this place wee are hereafter to treat more fully
now we are onely to cleare the signification of the word which in this place most evidently signifieth not to bee justified before god or made just but to bee approved or declared just
in which sense the schoolemen themselves doe teach that good workes doe justifie declarativè
but here it may be objected that saint iames in this place speaketh of that justification whereunto faith concurreth with good workes and good workes with faith
but to declare a man to bee justified faith being an inward and hidden grace of the heart hath no use or efficacy but it selfe is to be declared and manifested by workes as it is verse
answ
the apostle doth not speake

of justifying faith it selfe but of the profession thereof or of saith professed onely as appeareth by the fourteenth verse where the question is propounded what doth it profit my brethren if a man shall say hee hath faith and have not workes can that faith which is in profession onely save him now to the justification of a man before men and declaration of him to bee a man justified before god two things are requisite the profession of the true faith and a godly conversation answerable to that profession
for neither good workss declare a man to bee justified if they bee not joyned with the profession of the true faith neither doth the profession of faith justifie a man before men if his faith cannot bee demonstrated by good workes
and in this sense it is said that a man is justified that is knowne to bee just by workes and not by faith onely


his third testimony is apoc
qui justus est justificetur adhuc hee that is just let him bee justified still
answ
the word undefined span alphabet in this place doth not signifie to bee justified but to be just as the word is often used not onely in the translation of the septuagints but also in the new testament as have shewed before as being the translation not of the passive but of tsadaq the verbe neuter in cal which signifieth not to bee justified but to bee just
and this exposition is confirmed first by the words going before he that doth wrong let him doe wrong still hee that is filthy let him bee filthy still and so hee that is just let him bee just still
secondly by the authority of the complutensis editio of the kings bible of andraeas caesariensis and of arethas in apoc who instead of undefined span alphabet read undefined span alphabet let him worke righteousnesse of some latine editions of the vulgar translation which instead of justificetur read justitiam faciat and lastly of cyprian who rendreth the place thus justus adhuc justiora faciat
this

place therefore doth not speake of the encrease of our justification

before god which cannot bee encreased and much lesse are wee exhorted unto it for as soone as a man is justified hee standeth righteous before god in the most perfect righteousnesse of christ which admitteth no encrease but of perseverance in righteousnesse
moreover the word undefined span alphabet still doth not signifie encrease but continuance

vi
and these were bellarmine his three first significations of

the word justification whereof not any one can bee proved out of the word of god
fourthly saith he it is taken for the declaration of justice after a judiciall manner in which sense hee said to be justified who when he had beene by the accuser made guilty of some iniquity is by the sentence of the iudge declared iust and absolved
and to this purpose hee alleageth not onely prov

hee that justifieth the wicked and condemneth the just
and esay

but which are not so pertinent luk

and luk

now saith hee of the foure acceptions of the word our adversaries teach this fourth to be most proper
as for the econd and the third which ariseth from the second they say it is improper and not to bee found in any approved authors
but of this matter saith hee wee will discourse libro
cap

whether wee will follow him
in the meane time let it bee observed that the papists who cannot approve their owne acceptions of the word by any one place of scripture doe neverthelesse acknowledge that use of the word which we doe maintaine
but whereas hee doth insinuate that we doe therefore reject the second and third significations because the word is not so used in approved authors answer if hee speake of the latine word as hee doth that it is not used of the authors of the latine tongue at all and in the latine edition of the scriptures and from thence in other ecclesiasticall writers it is used as the translation of the hebrew and the greeke and must accordingly bee understood
and if of the greeke that it is not used indeed of the authors of the greeke tongue in the popish sense
but that is not the reason why wee reject those senses but because they are not to bee found in the holy scriptures

cap bellarmines discourse concerning the signification of the word justification de iustif lib

examined




bvt let us examine bellarmines disputation concerning the

signification of the word lib
cap

where alleaging

to prove justification by inherent righteousnesse he affirmeth that to be justified by christ in that place doth signifie to bee made just by obtaining righteousnesse
and this hee would prove by two reasons first out of those words jsti constistuentur multi many shall be constituted or made just from whence he argueth thus

to bee constituted just is to bee made just by inherent righteousnesse to bee justified is to bee constituted just rom

therefore to bee constituted just is to bee made just by righteousnesse inherent

answ
wee confesse that whosoever is justified is constituted yea is made just but the question is concerning the manner whether by infusion of righteousnesse or by imputation
the assumption therefore is granted by us
but the proposition is false and hath no ground in the scriptures
yea the contrary may bee proved out of the place alleaged where justification or making righteous is opposed not to the corruption of sinne but to guilt and condemnation vers
and
and therefore he is said in this place to be justified or constituted righteous who being absolved and acquitted from the guilt of sinne and from condemnation is accepted as righteous unto life for as in the former part of the
verse many are said to be constituted sinners that is as the

greeke interpreters doe expound it and as appeareth by the former verses guilty of sin and obnoxious to condemnation by the disobedience of ada meaning that one offence of his which we cal his fal which cannot be otherwise understood but by imputation so in the latter part many are said to be constituted just by the obedience of the second adam that is absolved from the guilt of sinne and condemnation and accepted as righteous in christ his obedience being communicated to them which cannot be by any other meanes but by imputation
neither can any reason be given why undefined span alphabet to bee constituted just should not be a judiciall word as well as undefined span alphabet to be justified
in all other places this verbe whether it bee used in the good sense or in the bad signifieth no such thing as bellarmine inferreth upon

it
for as in the bad it signifieth to convince or condemne as gal



iam

so in the good to approve or commend as rom

cor





and accordingly the meaning of this place may be this as by the disobedience of the first adam many were convicted and condemned as sinners that is guilty of sinne and damnation so by the obedience of the second adam many shall bee approved and accepted as righteous

his reason is from the antithesis of adam to christ which as shall hereafter

in his due place prove maketh wholly against him for if by the actuall disobedience of adam imputed unto us wee were made sinners then by the obedience of christ imputed unto us we are made righteous but the former is true therefore the latter
of this antithesis am hereafter to speake more at large in the meane time this may suffice to maintaine and justifie our exposition of the word against bellarmines cavils


ii
but here bellarmine frameth to himselfe a fourefold objection

of calvin and chemnitius proving that to justifie is a judiciall word signifying to absolve and to pronounce just
their first reason is because the apostle opposeth justifying to condemning as rom




therefore as god is said to condemne when he doth not acquit a man but pronouncing him guilty deputeth him unto punishment so on the contrary he is said to justifie when hee acquitteth and absolveth a man from guilt and pronouncing him just accepteth of him in christ as righteous unto eternall life
to this bellarmine shapeth two answeres first that justification is rightly opposed to condemnation but is not therefore alwayes a judiciall word for even condemnation it selfe sometimes is the act of a iudge appointing him to punishment who in judgement was found guilty and sometimes it is the effect of a fault which hath deserved punishment
and so adam hath condemned us and god condemneth but adam hath not condemned us by judging us after a judiciall manner but by imprinting in us originall sinne
after the same manner saith hee justification sometimes is the act of a iudge sometimes the effect of grace
and both wayes doth christ justifie us first as the second adam by deletion of sinne and infusion of grace secondly in the day of judgment by declaring them just whom before he had made just

reply iustification in this question and in the places alleaged is considered as an action of god and being referred to god it signifieth not to make just by infusion of righteousnesse but by sentence after the manner of a iudge to absolve from sinne and to pronounce and accept as righteous as being opposed to condemning which being referred to god signifieth not to make sinfull but by sentence after the manner of a iudge to pronounce the offendour guilty and to award him punishment
but what either justifying or condemning may signifie being referred to other either persons or things it is not materiall so that it be confessed which cannot be denied that justifying being ascribed to god signifieth not to make righteous by infusion no more than condemning being attributed to god signifieth to make wicked

by infusion but both are to bee understood as the actions of a judge who either pronouncing a man just absolveth him from guilt or pronouncing him guilty appointeth him to punishment
this therefore was an impertinent shift of a subtle sophister having nothing to say to the purpose for whereas he applyeth his distinction of condemning and justifying to the first and second adam as pertinent to the places alleaged answer first that neither is considered as the act of the first or second adam but as bellarmine confesseth in his second answer as the actions of god the iudge secondly that although in some sense the first adam may bee said to have condemned us as the second adam is truely said esai
to justifie us yet both is to bee understood of the guilt of sinne brought upon us by the one and taken away by the other
for as the first adam by his transgression may be said undefined span alphabet to have condemned us because hee hath inwrapped us in the guilt of his sinne and so made us guilty of death and obnoxious to the entence of condemnation that transgression of his being imputed us being in him as the root so the second adam may truely be said to justifie us who are in him both as a surety in taking upon him our guilt and paying our debt for us esai

and also as our intercessour and advocate pleading for us that by imputation of his righteousnesse we may be absolved from our sinnes and accepted as righteous in him


iii
his second answer is that although condemnation and justification

some where signifie the action of the iudge as in the place cited rom

yet notwithstanding when god doth justifie a sinner by dclaring him just he doth also make him just because the judgement of god is according to the truth
and therefore christ whether he justifieth us by his obedience or by his judgement he alwayes maketh just
and thus augustine saith he understood this place

reply that god maketh just whom he pronounceth just we freely confesse but the question still is of the manner for in justification when he pronounceth a man just he maketh him just and that perfectly just not by infusion of inherent righteousnesse but by imputation of christs righteousnesse
and whom hee justifieth that is maketh just by imputation of righteousnesse them hee also sanctifieth that is maketh just in some measure by infusion of grace
for to use bellarmines owne words when god doth justifie a sinner by declaring him righteous it is plaine that in himselfe hee is a sinner who by god is declared to bee just and therefore that hee is not justified by inherent justice for in himselfe he is a sinner as wee all are
how then shall the judgement of god bee according to the truth when hee declareth a sinner to bee just to a sinner beleeving in christ the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith is imputed for righteousnesse rom

and this we shall hereafter

shew to be an argument unanswerable

none remaining sinners in themselves can truely bee declared or pronounced just in respect of righteousnesse inherent

all mortall men even the most righteous of them meraine sinners

in themselves ioh

ecclus

therefore

no mortall man can truly be declared or pronounced just in respect of inherent righteousnesse and consequently none are or can bee justified by righteousnesse inherent

iiii
the testimony of augustine is falsified
for disputing

against the errour of the pelagians who imagined that originall sinne was not propagated from adam but that imitation onely maketh sinners by adam hee inferreth that then by the same reason onely imitation maketh just by christ
as though either adam had done no more against us or christ for us than that they had been prime examples and precedents the one of sinne the other of righteousnesse
but augustine sheweth out of rom
that as those who are regenerated by the spirit of christ obtaine remission of sinnes and inward grace so those who come from adam by naturall generation are made guilty of his sinne unto condemnation and also receive corruption from him by propagation all which we teach
but that augustine pleadeth not for justification by inherent justice appeareth by the antithesis which in that place hee maketh betwixt our condemnation by adam and our justification by christ
first that whereas to condemnation there concurres

our owne voluntary transgression besides adams sinne yet to our justification there doth not concurre any righteoufnesse besides christ
secondly which difference saint paul also noteth rom
because in the carnall generation originall sinne onely is contracted but in the spirituall regeneration there is remission not onely of originall but also of voluntary sinnes


the second reason of calvin and chemnitius which bellarmine

taketh upon him to confute is this because the apostle writing of justification did no doubt imitate the hebrew phrase though he wrote in greeke
but the hebrew word signifying to justifie hath the judiciall signification
the argument may thus be propounded

such as is the signification of the hebrew hitsdiq in the old testament the same is the signification of the greeke word undefined span alphabet both in the edition of the septuagints as being the translation thereof and in the new testament which in this point retaineth the translation of the septuagints but the hebrew hitsdiq is meerely a judiciall word opposed to condemnation as have proved heretofore by induction of examples as deut

king


prov

esai

and never signifieth to make righteous by infusion or to endue with righteousnesse inherent therefore the greeke word also hath the same signification

to the assumption bellarmine answereth that the hebrew word properly signifieth to make just but because a man may bee made just both inwardly by obtaining of justice and outwardly by declaration hence it is that the word admitteth these divers significations
reply
in this answer we are to take his confession of the truth both that we may be made just outwardly by declaration and also that the verbe sometimes doth signifie so much
in vaine therefore doe the papists urge against us the signification

of the latine word justificare as signifying justum facere seeing by our exposition it signifieth justum facere also not onely by declaration as bellarmine heere speaketh but much more by imputation
but though he confesseth the signification of the verbe urged by us yet wee may not acknowledge the signification so much urged by the papists yea wee confidently deny that the hebrew hitsdiq doth any where in the scriptures signifie to endùe with righteousnesse inherent

vi
this therefore hee endevoureth to prove by induction of

examples and first out of dan


qui adjustitiam erudiunt multos who instruct many to righteousnesse
the hebrew word is matsdiqim where the prophet speaking of the great glory which shall bee of teachers who justifie many the vulgar latine which is the onely authentique text among the papists doth not translate the word making righteous by infusion or enduing with righteousnesse inherent which is the worke of god alone and not of the teacher but instructing unto righteousnesse or as bellarmine himselfe expoundeth by teaching to bring men to righteousnesse which is done by bringing them to beleeve and therefore this allegation proveth not the popish signification of the word
yea but it disproveth saith bellarmine the judiciall signification so much urged by you
for teachers doe not justifie after the maner of udges howbeit the popish priests dot in their absolutions as themselves doe teach

reply
but this is nothing but a cavill
for where wee say that to justifie in this doctrine of justification is verbum forense a word taken from courts having a judiciall signification as namely to absolve from sinne or to give sentence with a man after the maner of a iudge our meaning is that this word being attributed to god as it is god alone that justifieth and so wee consider justification as an action of god it alwaies hath this judiciall signification and never signifieth to endue with righteousnesse inherent
but wee doe not say that it being attributed to any other as it is to divers others both perons and things it is to bee expounded as the act of the iudge though otherwise the justice implyed in the signification of the word bee after the judiciall sense not inherent but imputative
thus as have said before christ justifieth not onely as hee is our iudge but also as our surety paying our debt and as our advocate pleading for us
the holy ghost justifieth both as he is the spirit of regeneration working in us the grace of faith and as the spirit of adoption by applying unto us the merits of christ assuring us of our justification and adoption
the ministers of the gospell justifie as they are also said to forgive sinnes to beget men unto god and to save them ministerially as the embassadours of christ whose office it is to reconcile men unto god to preach and to pronounce remission of sinnes to them that beleeve and also instrumentally as the instruments of the holy ghost to worke in them the grace of faith by which they are justified for faith commeth by hearing rom

and preachers are said to bee ministers by whom you beleeve cor

sacraments doe justifie as

seales of that righteousnesse which is by faith rom

and as the ministery of the word and sacraments doe justifie ut manus dantis as the hand of god giving and applying christ and his righteousnesse to the faithfull receiver so faith is manus accipietis the hand of the beleever receiving christ and his righteousnesse unto justification

vii
but the second place is in his conceit more cleare viz

esai

where the lord speaking by his prophet concerning christ saith my righteous servant shall by his knowledge justifie many and he shll beare their sinnes where the verbe is in hiphil iatsdiq which signifieth shall make just chemnitius indeed saith he goeth about to wrest this place also to the judiciall signification but in vaine for there are foure words which are manifestly repugnant to his interpretation
but before wee speake of those foure words let us heare what

chemnitius saith whereas andradius saith he wresteth that sentence of esay to prove that to justifie is to endue the minde with the quality of inherent justice it is great impudencie for there is presently added an exposition how that justification is to be understood because he shall saith esay beare their iniquities where chemnitius doth not so much as mention the judiciall signification of the word justifying after the manner of a iudge but rather signifieth that christ at his first comming did not justifie the elect after the manner of a iudge but as a surety in taking upon himselfe our debt and bearing our iniquities and as a redeemer paying our ransome and so charging us from our debt and from our bondage
neither doth it follow that it is not a judiciall word because in that place it signifieth not to justifie as a iudge for besides the iudge there are other parties also who doe justifie in a judiciall sense as namely sureties and advocates


viii
now let us examine those foure words all which serve to

prove that christ in that place is not said to justifie after the manner of a iudge which no man affirmeth and therefore bellarmine fighteth with his owne shadow
for we doubt not but that christ may be said to justifie divers wayes first by his doctrine as our prophet and teacher· in which sense teachers are said to justifie dan


secondly as our priest both by his satisfaction and sacrifice propitiatory as esai

for so he saith and he shall beare their iniquities so heb

and also by his intercession as our advocate ioh

rom

heb

thirdly by his sentence as our king and judge at the

last day matth


the first word is by his knowledge that is as he expoundeth it out of hierome by his doctrine
answ
wee deny not but that christ by his doctrine did justifie many working in them the grace of faith for even other teachers who are but his ministers doe also justifie others as daniel speaketh not by infusion of righteousnesse but as the instruments of the holy ghost to beget faith in the hearers or being as saint paul speaketh ministers by whom they doe beleeve and beleeving are justified in the judiciall sense
but esay speaketh not of his doctrine but of his knowledge and that passively understood not for that knowledge whereby he knoweth all things but

whereby hee is acknowledged to bee the messias that is to say faith and so pagnine vatablus and tremellius read scientia sui or agnitione sui that is by faith in him for so is faith often termed as pet


and tim


by which as it is said in this place of esay hee doth justifie la rabbim that is as paul speaketh rom

undefined span alphabet the multitude of the elect who beleeve in him how by bearing their iniquitis that is the punishment due for their sinnes his sufferings being imputed to them if therefore justifying by faith doe prove justification by works or by inherent righteousnesse then this word proveth it


ix
the second word is ipse justus by which word saith he is signified

that christ doth justifie not onely by teaching but also by just working and by imparting his righteousnesse unto us
answ
christ his obedience or just working is proper to his person and inherent in him and therefore that righteousnesse which he performed in his owne person being both active and therefore transient and proper to his person and therefore without us cannot be imparted to us otherwise than by imputation
to what purpose then doth he urge this word seeing christ is just in justifying us as well by imputation as by infusion forsooth to shew that christ by his obedience and sufferings doth not justifie after the manner of a iudge which no man affirmeth
but what is his reason because it is not required to justifying after a judiciall manner that he who justifieth others should himselfe be just as if he should say it is not required that a iudge should bee just contrary to that gen

but god doth justifie us after the judiciall manner as a iudge through the redemption that is in christ iesus and by forgivenesse of sinnes and that to this end to shew forth his justice that hee might bee just· and the justifier of him who beleeveth in iesus rom

but this might better have beene objected against his owne exposition of the former word seeing he who is not just himselfe may by his doctrine justifie others
notwithstanding that which bellarmine here áffirmeth concerning christ is most true that it was necessary that he who should justifie others by his obedience should bee just himselfe howbeit he impertinently alleageth rom

which speaketh of god justifying us not as a mediator by his obedience but as a iudge by his sentence
but the true reason why the prophet useth this word is in respect of the words following to signifie that iesus christ the righteous was made a propitiation for our sinnes ioh

and that christ who was just and knew no sinne was made sinne for us that wee might bee the righteousnesse of god in him as the apostle speaketh cor

and esai




the third word is my servant which signifieth that christ did

serve his father in the worke of justification and consequently did justifie men not by judging but by ministring as himselfe saith matth


and is therefore called the minister of circumcision that is of the iewes
the

fourth word and he shall beare their iniquities which signifieth the manner how christ by ministring doth justifie that is by bearing the burden of our sinnes upon his shoulders that is by suffering the punishment due for our

sinnes
answ
the thing which hee indevoureth to prove viz that christ as he performed the office of mediation in the dayes of his flesh did not justifie us ater the manner of a iudge is true
but his reasons are not sufficient
not the former for he might bee gods minister or servant as all kings or iudges are and yet our iudge
not the second for although he were our priest to offer himselfe for us and by his obedience and sufferings to justifie us yet is he also our king and our iudge who by his sentence will justifie us at the last day
but although christ did not justifie us after the manner of a iudge yet it followeth not either that the word doth signifie infusion of justice to which purpose andradius alleaged this place or that it is not a judiciall word
for it is a judicial word as it is attributed not only to iudges but also to sureties and advocates
christ as our advocate justifieth by pleading for us as asurety by bearing the punishment judicially imposed upon us
and whereas bellarmine would prove out of pet


that inherent righteousnesse is an effect of christs satisfaction or bearing our iniquities he proveth nothing but what we teach viz that the fruits and end of our justification and redemption by christ is our sanctification luk

rom

tit

and consequently that our sanctification or inherent righteousnesse being the fruit and effect of our justification cannot bee the cause thereof no more than it is the cause of redemption
for

by what righteousnesse wee are redeemed by the same wee are justified for redemption and justification in substance differ not rom





col

eph

by the righteousnesse of christ wee are redeemed which is out of us in him and not by righteousnesse inherent
therefore by that righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him wee are justified and not by righteousnesse inherent

his third place is apoc

which have fully answered before

and is here impertinently recited to prove the signification of the hebrew word being not sufficient to cleare the greeke
seeing their owne best editions in stead of undefined span alphabet read undefined span alphabet as have shewed before


ii
the third and fourth reason which bellarmine alleageth out of calvin and chemnitius and answereth them together are concerning the signification and composition of the latine word justificare which indeed are not used as arguments to prove the true signification of the word in this controversie but as just exceptions against the arguments of the papists who rely too much upon the signification and composition of the latine word wherein they were justly reprooved by chemnitius first because the controversie being what is the use and signification of the word in the scriptures it is not materiall what the latine word doth signifie in other authors but what is the signification of the hebrew word in the old testament and of the greeke in the new whereof the latine is meerely a translation
and therefore the latine if it be a right translation must in this controversie bee understood

to signifie the selfe same thing with the hebrew and the greeke the use and signification whereof in the scriptures is judiciall and is neuer used in the popish sense wherefore though the use of the word in other authors did favour the popish conceipt yet would it not disadvantage us secondly though the latine words do signific to make just which is all that can be enforced from the signification and composition thereof and be so expounded by augustine whom bellarmine to that purpose alleageth yet this maketh nothing against us
not onely because bellarmine hath confessed men may be made just either inwardly by obtaining of righteousnesse inherent or outwardly after a judiciall manner but also because we freely professe that whom god doth justifie he maketh righteous by imputation of christs righteousnesse
it is true indeed that some of our divines deny the word to signifie making righteous but their deniall is to be understood according to the meaning of the papists viz by infusion thirdly the latine word justificare and so the english as in the translation of the scriptures it hath alwayes the judiciall signification and never signifieth to endue with righteousnesse inherent no more than the hebrew and the greeke whereof it is a translation so oftentimes in the fathers and many times in the popish writers and alwayes almost in the common use of speech it signifieth to cleare from guilt to free from imputation of fault to approve to declare or pronounce just
or if at any time it be used in the sense of induing with righteousnesse inherent it is contrary to the use of the scriptures which in the doctrine of justification is to be retained


xii yea but the fathers interpret justifying to be making righteous

whom to refuse in an ecclesiasticall question and to appeale to the judgement of the latine authors as tully and terence is a great importunity saith bellarmine especially seeing the apostle hath taught that to be justified is to be constituted or made just according to the composition of the word
answ
that which is said of the authors of the latine tongue is a meere calumniation for in them the word is not used at all
the interpretation of the fathers according to the doctrine of saint paul wee approve acknowledging that whom god doth justifie hee maketh them just by imputation of christs righteousnesse
yea but say they the fathers meane by inherent justice
answ
though some of the latine fathers who were ignorant of the hebrew and not skilfull in the greeke sometimes under the terme of justification include the benefit also of sanctification being led thereunto by the notation of the latine word yet sometimes they exclude it as first when they place justification in remission of sinnes as many times they doe secondly when according to the scriptures they oppose it to condemnation thirdly and especially when with one consent they plainely teach that we are justified by faith alone as hereafter shall be shewed which cannot be understood of justification by inherent righteousnesse
for it were very absurd to affirme which the papists would faine father upon us that to justification by inherent righteousnesse nothing is required

but faith only
againe bellarmine objecteth which in the ninth chapter where he confesseth justification to be often taken in the scriptures for declaration of righteousnesse he more plainely expresseth although to justifie were every where taken for to pronounce just yet that were no advantage to us
for a sinner cannot truely be pronounced just unlesse he who pronounceth him just doe withall make him just which god onely can doe
and therefore hee alone is said to justifie a sinner and by absolving him to make him truely just
answere
whom god pronounceth just them hee maketh just but still the question is of the manner for to justifie by absolving is to make righteous by the not imputing of sinne and imputing of righteousnesse and not by infusion of righteousnesse for that is not to justifie but to sanctifie
howbeit wee freely confesse that whom god justifieth hee also sanctifieth and that whosoever is in christ iesvs hee is a new creature
but howsoever these graces doe alwayes concurre insomuch that whosoever hath the one hath the other and whosoever hath not both hath neither yet notwithstanding they must carefully bee distinguished
and that is it which hitherto have endevoured to prove

cap vi hw iustification and sanctification are to be distinguished



now let us consider how they are distinguished

and first the difference of them may appeare by their contraries
the contrary to justifying is condemning the contrary to sanctifying is polluting or defiling with sinne first therefore the word which signifieth to condemne if you respect the force of the word signifieth to make

wicked even as the verbe which signifieth to justifie doth if you respect the force

of the word it signifieth to make just as god therefore when hee condemneth is said to make wicked not by infusion of wickednesse but by his sentence pronouncing the party guilty and deputing him to punishment so when hee justifieth he maketh just by his sentence not by infusion of righteousnesse quatenus justificat but by imputation of christs righteousnesse he absolveth the party from guilt and punishment and accepteth of him as righteous in christ and as an heire of eternall life secondly the contrary to sanctifying which is to make holy is polluting or defiling

with sinne which is to make unholy and uncleane
what difference therefore is betweene condemning and polluting the like is betweene justifying and sanctifying
and as condemning and polluting are by no meanes to bee confounded no more can justifying and sanctifying


ii
in justification wee are freed from the guilt of sinne in sanctification from the corruption or pollution of sinne
for god is then

said to justifie us when he absolveth us from the guilt of sinne by imputation of christs righteousnesse and hee is then said to sanctifie us when by his spirit he mortifieth sinne in us and freeth us in some measure from the corruption thereof


ii
iustification is an action of god without us as also are redemption reconciliation and adoption which three benefits in substance

differ not from justification but are all comprehended under it the second first being the same in effect with the former part of justification viz remission of sinnes and the last being all one with the second part of justification which is acceptation of the beleever as righteousnesse in christ and as an heire of eternall life as have shewed heretofore for then are wee said to have redemption

when wee have remission of sinnes then is god said to reconcile

us unto himselfe

when hee doth not impute our sinnes unto us then hee is said to adopt us when hee accepteth

of us in christ as righteous and as heires of eternall life
none of these actions doth worke a reall change in the party but importeth a new relation betweene god and them as hath beene shewed
but sanctification is an action of gods spirit within us working in us a reall change by mortification of sinne within us and infusion of grace and righteousnesse into us


iv
of justification the matter is the righteousnesse of christ

which is in him as the subject but imputed to us the matter of sanctification is a righteousnesse derived from christ but inherent in us
the matter therefore of our justification is perfect but not inherent to wit the most perfect righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him
the matter of our sanctification is inherent but not perfect to wit justitia inchoata a righteousnesse which is but begun in us and that new obedience which though it be sincere and unfained is with great infirmity performed by us recta forsan sed non pura justitia as bernard saith


hereupon it followeth that of justification it selfe whereby wee are justified before god there are no degrees though óf the assurance

thereof there bee which are the degrees of speciall faith because to the most perfect righteousnesse of christ by which we are even in our first conversion justified nothing can be added and therefore as have said the faith of all the faithfull though different in degrees is undefined span alphabet

of equall worth in the righteousnesse of god and our saviour iesus christ even as the hands of divers men though unequall in strength yet are of equall efficacie in respect of the almes received thereby
but of sanctification there are degrees according to the measure of grace received


vi
the forme of justification considered as an action of god is imputation of christs righteousnesse of sanctification the infusion

of righteousnesse
for god by imputation of christs righteousnesse doth justifie us and he doth sanctifie by infusion of righteousnesse


vii
the parts of justification are remission or not imputing

of sinne unto condemnation and acceptation as righteous unto life both wrought by imputation of christs righteousnesse unto us
the parts of sanctification are mortification whereby wee dye unto sinne and vivification whereby wee live unto righteousnesse rising from the grave of sinne unto newnesse of life and is therefore called the first resurrection both wrought in us by the spirit of sanctification


viii
wee are justified by faith not as it is a grace or habit in

us that is to say as it is a part of inherent righteousnesse but as the hand or instrument receiving the righteousnesse of christ which is imputed to them that beleeve but wee are sanctified by faith as it is a part of that righteousnesse which is inherent in us
and therefore wee are justified by faith alone because no other grace doth concurre with it to the act of justification none of them serving to receive the righteousnesse of christ but faith onely but we are not sanctified by faith alone because with it concurre not onely all other inward graces but also our outward obedience


ix
the righteousnesse by which wee are justified is not prescribed in the law but without

the law is revealed in the gospell

the righteousnesse of god that is to say of christ who is god apprehended by faith
for the law to justification requireth perfect and perpetuall obedience to bee performed by him in his owne person that should bee justified thereby which fince the fall of adam hath beene and is by reason of the flesh impossible to all men who are descended from adam by ordinary generation
but the gospell assureth justification without respect of workes to all that truely beleeve in christ teaching that wee are justified by faith that is by the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith without the workes of the law that is without respect of any obedience prescribed in the law and performed by us
but the righteousnesse by which wee are sanctified is prescribed in the law which is a most perfect rule of all righteousnesse inherent


unto the act of justification our owne righteousnesse and obedience doe not concurre as any cause thereof but follow in the subject

that is the party justified as necessary fruits of our redemption and justification
yea in the question of justification wherein is considered what that is by which wee are justified and saved in hope our owne righteousnesse and obedience if it should bee obtruded as the matter of our justification is to be esteemed as

dung that we may bee found in christ not having our owne righteousnesse which is prescribed in the law but that which is through the faith of christ
but in the question of sanctification that righteousnesse which is inherent in us and that obedience which is performed by us is all in all as being

both that habituall and also actuall righteousnesse and holinesse wherein our sanctification doth consist


xi by our justification wee are

entituled to gods kingdome that is saved in hope by our sanctification we are fitted and prepared for gods kingdome into which no uncleane

thing can enter
iustification therefore is the right of gods children to their inheritance
sanctification is the cognizance and marke of those that shall bee saved wherefore our saviour saith that

by faith wee have remission of sinnes and inheritance among them that are sanctified


xii
the righteousnesse by which we are justified is the meritorious cause of our salvation
but the righteousnesse by which we are sanctified is a fruit of our justification but no cause of our salvation unlesse you will call it causam sine quâ non which is no cause for we are neither saved by it nor for it but onely by and for the merits of christ apprehended by faith
but though it bee not the cause by or for which wee are justified or saved yet it is the way wherein wee being once justified are to walke towards our countrey in heaven ephes


as bernard well saith via regni non causa regnandi the way which leadeth to the kingdome but not the cause of comming unto it
xiii
by our justification wee have our right and title to the kingdome of heaven but according to the duties of sanctification as the evidence shall the sentence of salvation bee pronounced at the last day


xiv
we are justified by the grace of god as it signifieth onely

his gracious love and favour in christ
but wee are sanctified by gods grace not onely as it signifieth the favour of god in himselfe but also as it signifieth the graces or gifts of grace infused into us and

inherent in us


xv
in justification and in the parts thereof wee are meerely patients but in the duties of sanctification wee are also agents who being acted by the holy ghost doe cooperate with him
for which

cause the holy ghost in the scriptures doth never exhort us to justification or the parts thereof viz remission of sinne and acceptation of the beleever as righteous unto life as being the actions of god but to sanctification and the parts thereof he useth to exhort as to mortification

col
to vivification ephes
to both ezek


xvi
the acts of faith are of two sorts some tending to justification

some to sanctification
the former are immediate which are

called actus eliciti which it bringeth forth of it selfe without the mediation of any other grace that is to beleeve in christ by beleeving to receive him and by receiving him to justifie the beleever and therefore faith doth justifie alone
the other mediate which it bringeth

forth by the meanes of other graces which are called actus imporati and are the fruits of faith working by love and other graces tending to sanctification
thus faith by

love worketh obedience and therefore it dtoh not sanctifie alone


xvii
of justification the apostle treateth in the five first chapters

of the epistle to the romanes of sanctification in the sixth and seventh


xviii
our saviour christ the blessed angels adam in his

integrity were sanctified but not justified properly
for justification onely is of sinners and consisteth partly in remission of sinnes


xix
of this difference betweene justification and sanctification

the papists will by no meanes take notice though it bee manifold and manifest
but will needs understand justification to be that which wee according to the scriptures call sanctification
and this is the very ground both of their malitious calumniations against us and also of their owne damnable errours concerning justification
for as if we also did confound justification and sanctification they charge us as if wee taught that wee are sanctified by faith alone that wee are formally made just or sanctified by a righteousnesse which is without us

but if wee did hold that justification were to bee confounded with sanctification we would acknowledge that the most things which the papists affirme concerning justification are true because they are true of sanctification
as namely that wee are not sanctified by faith alone that we are sanctified by a righteousnesse inherent in us and performed by us that it is partly habituall consisting in the habits of grace as faith hope charity and partly actuall which is our new obedience consisting in good workes which are the fruits and effects of our faith and charity and other inward graces
that of sanctification there are degrees and that by exercise and practice of the duties of holinesse and righteousnesse our sanctification is encreased


xx
what then is the difference betweene us and the papists

in this great controvefie onely in words nothing lesse
for as their confounding of justification and sanctification is the ground of their calumniations against us so of their owne errours
for confounding justification and sanctification first they confound the law and the

gospell the covenant of workes and the covenant of grace as if the gospell did unto justification require inherent and that a more perfect righteousnesse than the law requireth
and consequently with the false apostles and teachers of the galatians doe teach another

gospell than that which the apostle taught which whosoever doth hee is accursed
whrefore the samethings which the apostle objecteth against the galatians who were seduced by their false teachers are verified of the papists who seekng to be justified by the workes of the

law are under the curse they are fallen

from grace to them the promise is of no effect to them christ dyed in vaine then christ profiteth nothing as hereafter shall shew
for whosoever seeketh to bee justified by the workes of the law hee is a

debtour to the whole law and to him who is a debtour to the whole law that is to bee subject to the curse if he transgresse it and to be excluded from justification and salvation if he doe not perfectly fulfill it christ profiteth nothing
for whereas they distinguish the workes which they make the condition of both the covenants that the one are the workes of nature the other of

grace it is evident that all good workes and all inherent righteousnesse is prescribed in the law which is the most perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse
secondly that inherent righteousnesse is not the condition of the covenant of grace but is the thing promised to all that truely beleeve
for the better understanding whereof wee are to know that the covenant of workes was made with all mankinde in adam the covenant of grace with the heires of promise in christ
the former promiseth justification to these who in their owne persons performe perfect obedience that perfect obedience being the condition of the covenant
the latter that to us the sonnes of abraham being redeemed and justified by faith the lord will give grace

to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him in which our

new obedience consisteth which as said is not the condition of the promise but the thing promised


xxi
secondly by confounding justification and sanctification

they teach men to place the matter of justification and merit of salvation in themselves
for the matter of sanctification is inherent and that which is the matter of justification is the merit of salvation
againe that which is inherent is both prescribed in the law and is also our owne though received from god which the pharisie

himselfe confessed when he thanked god for it
but the holy ghost doth teach us that wee are neither justified by the obedience or righteousnesse which is taught

in the law nor by that

which is ours
and in regard of this very difference betwixt the papists and us wee are not unworthily called evangelici the professors of the gospell and they the enemies thereof who seeking to establish their owne righteousnesse doe with scorne reject the righteousnesse of christ imputed which is that righteousnesse of god

revealed in the gospell from faith to faith
this being the maine doctrine of the gospell that we are justified not by any righteousnesse inherent in our selves or performed by our selves but by the righteousnesse of christ alone apprehended by faith


xxii
by confounding justification and sanctification and so

of two benefits making but one they doe abolish and take away that maine benefit of the messias by which we are not onely freed from hell but also intituled unto the kingdome of heaven which the scriptures distinctly call our justification without which there can bee no salvation
for whom god doth justifie all them

and onely them he doth glorifie
and that they doe wholly take away the benefit of justification it shall further appeare in handling the second question of this first controverfie whereof am now to speake

cap vii
that the papists exclude remission of sinne from iustification and in stead thereof have put expulsion and extinction of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse and that they fouly erre therein



bvt heare it will be objected that so long as

the papists acknowledge remission of sinne to concurre unto justification they cannot be said wholly to take away the benefit of justification but rather to follow the judgement of some of the latine fathers who sometimes comprehending the benefit of sanctification under the name of justification seemed to make justification to consist in remission of sinne and sanctification
whereunto answere that indeed the papists pretend so much
for the councell

of trent in expresse termes saith that justification is not remission of sins alone but also sanctification and renovation of the inner man and to the like purpose bellarmine

disputeth that justification doth not consist in the remission of sinnes alone but also in inward renovation
and yet all this is but a meere colourable pretence for as they exclude from justification the imputation of christs righteousnesse by which onely wee have remission of sinne so they doe indeed and in truth exclude remission it selfe
and as in stead of imputation of righteousnesse they have brought in infusion of justice so in stead of remission of sinne by imputation of christs righteousnesse they have brought in the utter expulsion extinction deletion of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse
and for this they have some shew of reason for if they should hold that justification consisteth partly in remission that is in the forgivenesse or not imputation of sinne and partly in renovation or sanctification then they must confesse that there are two formall causes of justification which calvin

objected against the councell of trent and may truly bee objected against such of the fathers as held justification to consist partly in remission and partly in renovation and consequently should bee forced to acknowledge two wayes of making men just by one and the same act of justification the one by imputation of that righteousnesse by which being without us we have remission of sinne the other by infusion of righteousnesse inherent by which sinne is expelled
but the councell of trent doth stedfastly hold that there is but one formall cause of

justification and that is infusion of justice whereby sinne is expelled
what then becometh of remission of sinne which according both to scriptures and fathers concurreth to justification say of it as of justification the name is retained but the thing is taken away


ii
heere therefore am to shew two things first that the papists

from justification exclude remission of sinne by putting into the roome thereof the expulsion and extinction of sinne which belongeth not to justification but to sanctification and consequently doe wholly abolish by their doctrine the benefit of justification
secondly that remission of sinne is not the utter extinction or deletion thereof
as touching the former when calvin objected against the councell of trent that it made two formall causes of justification

bellarmine answereth thus the councell of trent in expresse termes said that there is but one onely formall cause of justification
yea but say wee the councell seemeth to make two viz remission of sinnes and renovation
but saith he when the councell maketh mention severally of remission of sin and of infusion of grace it did it not to signifie that there is a twofold formall cause of justification but to declare that there are two termes of that motion which is called justification or two effects of the same cause
for there cannot bee that mutation or translation which the councell noteth to bee in justification unlesse by remission of sinne a man cease to bee wicked and by infusion of justice begin to be godly
but saith hee as the aire when it is enlightened of the sunne by the same light which it receiveth ceaseth to bee darke and beginneth to be lightsome
so a man by the same justice given and infused by the sunne of righteousnesse ceaseth to bee unjust the light of grace expelling the darknesse of sinne and beginneth to bee just the light of grace succeeding the darkenesse of sinne
and as in calefaction which similitude hee useth elsewhere the accesse of heat expelleth cold so in justification the infusion of justice expelleth sinne
this then is the doctrine of the new church of rome that in this mutation called justification which they define to bee

a passage from sinne to righteousnesse though there be as in all other motions duo termini viz sinne which is terminus quo and righteousnesse which is terminus ad quem yet there are not two distinct actions concurring viz remission or expulsion of sinne and infusion of righteousnesse but one and the same action which is the infusion of justice expelling sinne even as in calefaction though there bee two termes cold and hot yet there are not two actions for the same action of fire which bringeth in heat expelleth cold and so in illumination there are two termes darkenesse and light but not two actions for one and the same act of the sunne which bringeth light driveth away darkenesse
whereby it is evident that by remission of sinne the papists doe not understand as all men from the beginning of the world have understood pardoning forgiving not imputing sinne but the utter deletion expulsion abolition of it which bellarmine calleth

veram remissionem true remission as if the pardoning of the offence and taking away the guilt were not true remission

but this true remission they hold to bee such that in a man

who is justified and hath remission of sinne there is no sinne remaining and hee onely is to bee held a just man in whom there is no sinne
thus then remission of sinne is by the papists excluded from justification and that brought in the roome of it which belongeth to that perfection of sanctification whereunto none attaine in this life


iii
now that the papists grossely erre in making remission of

sinne to bee the utter abolition or expulsion of it by infusion of righteousnesse may appeare by these arguments first whereas in sinne there are two things to bee considered the guilt and the corruption or anomy thereof it is evident that the guilt of sinnes past is taken away by remission wholly and at once the corruption is taken away by mortification thereof not wholly in this life and at once but by degrees we being day by day

renewed in the inner man
the latter is the worke of gods spirit within us
the former is an action of god without us such as is that of the creditor in remitting or forgiving a debt
and so the scriptures conceive of remission
for our sinnes are debts in respect of the guilt binding us over to punishment which wee owe for them
when as god therefore remitteth the debt releaseth this obligation forgiveth the punishment hee is said to remit our sinnes
this our saviour taught by the parables of the creditors and debtors matth


luk

and thus he hath taught us to pray matth


forgive us our debts as wee forgive our debtors
how doe wee forgive by not revenging the offence but laying aside all desire and purpose of revenge by passing by it and as it were forgetting it by covering it with

charity by not imputing it by being reconciled unto the party who hath offended us not by a reall taking away of the sinne from the offender but a wiping of it out of our remembrance not by expelling the offence out of the offender but out of our thoughts


iv
thus in the scriptures to remit sinne is not to abolish and

extinguish the sinne it selfe but to absolve from the guilt of sinne to pardon and to forgive the debt and to remit the punishment to cover a mans sinne and not to impute it
and this plainely appeareth by these manifold phrases which are used in the scriptures to signifie remission of sinne all which import the taking away of the guilt but none the utter abolishing of the corruption

so the latine remittere dimittere ignoscere condonare donare veniam dare parcere propitium esse and the english to remit to pardon to forgive



for the farther clearing of this point let us consider these three things first what that is which is remitted
secondly where it

remaineth untill it bee remitted
thirdly by what act of god it is remitted
the thing remitted is our debt matth


the subject where it remaineth are the bookes of gods providence and of our own consciences
the act of god in remitting our debts is the wiping them out of his remembrance as it were his the debt is the sinne it selfe which maketh us debtors unto god
and therefore sinnes

are called debts and sinners debtors matth


cum luk

matth


luk

cum
which also appeareth by the parables of the debtors luk

matth


and therefore sinners are called debtors because for their sinnes they owe punishment unto which by the just ordination of god they are obliged
this obligation whereby sinners are bound over to punishment is called reatus that is guilt
when as therefore god remitteth sins he forgiveth the debt hee remitteth or releaseth the punishment hee taketh away the guilt whereby we were bound over to punishment
and converso when god forgiveth the debt releaseth the punishment taketh away the guilt he is said to remit sinne
now sinnes are either habituall or actuall an habituall sinne god doth remit when hee doth take away the guilt of it

and cover the anomy of it not that it should not be at all but that it should not bee imputed as augustine

saith of concupiscence or originall sinne whereof all particular habituall

sinnes are

members and branches
actuall sinnes god doth remit when he doth forgive the sinfull act

it selfe and the guilt also which remaineth after the act is past and gone


vi
but here the papists have found out a new devise to confirme their error in confounding justification and sanctification that whereas

there are two things which as themselves doe teach

remaine in the soule after the act of sinne hath been committed viz reatus macula the guilt and the blemish or spot they teach against sense that it is properly the macula which is remitted in justification
but then say what becometh of the punishment the guilt binding over to punishment it is certaine that the infusion of righteousnesse doth not take away the guilt nor free us from punishment
neither can we be freed either rom the one or the other but only by the satisfaction of christ imputed unto us
hence therfore they should have learned to distinguish between justification and sanctification rather than to confound them that whereas there are two things remaining after sinne committed the guilt and the pollution the guilt is taken away by imputation of christs righteousnesse in our justification the pollution is in some

measure cleansed in our sanctification


vii
and how soever that which they say of the macula or pollution

remaining is true in respect of originall sinne wherein upon the guilt of adams transgression imputed there followeth an universall macula or corruption consisting of two parts the privation of originall righteousnesse and an evill disposition and pronenesse to all manner of sinne by which twofold corruption all the parts and faculties of the soule are defiled yet it seemeth not to be altogether true in regard of mens personall sinnes in respect of either part for as touching the former part which is the privation neither are the unregenerate by their actuall sinnes deprived of grace or righteousnesse infused which they had not before they sinned neither are the regenerate utterly deprived of grace by such sinnes as they commit as have elsewhere

proved and as touching the latter part which is the evill disposition this macula whereof they speake is no new evill disposition making him a sinner who before was not but an evill disposition remaining of the old man which by committing of actuall sinnes is increased
insomuch as where the same actuall sinne is often committed and reiterated that evill disposition groweth to bee an habit
for all evill dispositions or habituall sinnes which are in men are either the reliquia or remnants of originall sinne in some measure mortified or the increments thereof when by the committing of actuall sinnes they receive increase
and such a thing is that macula whereof they speake which remaining in the soule per modum habitus is to bee taken away as all other habituall sinnes are as they are pollutions by the mortification

of them which is a part of sanctification and not of justification
neither is the mortification of sinne a totall deletion or abolition thereof in this life as if no sinne or corruption remained in the party justified or sanctified for though in the forgiving or remitting of originall sinne the guilt bee wholly taken away yet the corruption which is called concupiscence remaineth more or lesse mortified


viii
now followeth the subject where that which is to bee

remitted doth remaine and from whence when it is remitted it is wiped or blotted out that is gods remembrance and our conscience which are as it were the lords according to which bookes he will judge apoc

the former is the booke of gods providence psalm




wherein all offences are written and wherein they remaine upon record hos



ier

the other is the booke of our conscience which is as it were the lords atturney indicting us of sinne
in regard whereof david saith psalm


doe know or am conscious to my transgressions and my sinne is ever before mee
out of the former booke the lord doth wipe out sinnes when he justifieth us in the court of heaven out of the latter when we are justified in the court of our owne conscience


ix
and hereby the third thing appeareth namely by what

act of god our sinnes are remitted
for if that which is remitted be a

debt which is recorded in gods booke then this debt is remitted not by any act of god within us either really wiping the pollution out of our soules or infusing grace into them both which are done in some measure after the debt is remitted in our sanctification but by an act of god without us wiping our sinnes out of his booke blotting them out of his remembrance esai

turning his face from them psalm

but forgiving and forgetting them and accepting of christs satisfaction for them in the behalfe of all that truely beleeve in christ rom



our fifth argument may be this the utter deletion of sinne

is not granted in this life remission of sinne is granted to the faithfull in this life therefore remission of sinne is not the utter deletion of it

the proposition is certaine for during this life sinne remaineth in the best rom


ioh

the assumption is undeniable as being an article of our faith testified in many places of scripture
or thus if in justification there were an utter deletion or abolition of sinne then in those that are justified there is no sinne
but there is no mortall man though justified in whom there is no sinne
therefore in justification there is not a totall deletion of sinne


xi sixthly if remission of sin be an utter deletion of the corruption

by infusion of righteousnesse and nothing else concurre to justification but infusion of righteousnesse expelling sin what then becommeth of the guilt of sinne and the punishment how is our debt satisfied the justice infused though it should utterly expell the corruption yet it neither doth nor can satisfie for the punishment as bellarmine himselfe confesseth
neither is there any other satisfaction or propitiation for our sinnes whereby gods justice may be satisfied our debt discharged our selves freed from hell and damnation but onely the satisfaction of christ without imputation whereof there is no justification nor salvation but none of this is done by righteousnesse infused expelling sinne
wherefore the papists if they will bee saved must acknowledge besides the benefit of the infusion of righteousnesse expelling the corruption of sinne which they call justification but is indeed sanctification another greater benefit whereby we are both freed from hell and entituled to heaven by imputation of christs satisfaction called in the scriptures justification which they by their antichristian doctrine have utterly abolished


xii seventhly that which worketh no reall change in the party

doth not really take away and expell all sin from him by infusion of righteousnesse for that cannot bee done without a reall yea and a great change in the party
true remission of sinne doth not worke a reall

change in the party
therefore the true remission of sinne doth not really take away and expell all sinne by infusion of righteousnesse
the assumption is thus proved first the forgiving of a debt worketh no reall change in the debtor but relative
the true remission of sinne is the forgiving of our debt therefore the true remission doth not worke a reall change in the party
secondly that which is imputative doth not worke a reall change in the party but is an act wrought without the party
true remission of sinne is imputative as the apostle teacheth rom

consisting in the not imputing of sinne presupposing the imputing of righteousnesse without workes therefore it worketh not a reall change


xiii
my eighth argument is from theabsurdities which follow

upon this popish doctrine
first necessity of despairing not onely to the tender conscience labouring under the burden of sinne but also to all not cauterized consciences which have any sense of their

owne estate
for if remission of sinne bee the utter deletion of sinne then have not they neither can they have remission of sinne in whom any sinne remaineth and those that neither have nor can have remission of sinne in this life because sinne doth ever remaine in them what remaineth to them but despaire secondly that there is no necessity of the imputation of christs righteousnesse for justification because there is in them both a totall deletion of sinne and an infusion of perfect righteousnesse whereby sinne is wholly expelled
and these as you shall heare hereafter

are two of bellarmines

principall arguments to prove the imputation of christs righteousnesse to bee needlesse both because when our sinnes are remitted they are utterly abolished so that whosoever is justified is no longer a sinner in himselfe nor hath any sinne remaining in him and also because in justification there is an infusion of perfect righteousnesse
the third that to remission of sinne there needeth no favour or indulgence for pardon or forgivenesse for if remission of sinne be a totall deletion of sinne by infusion of perfect righteousnesse then without any accession of favour the one contrary is necessarily expelled by the other
and this doth vasques professe in expresse termes mihi semper

necessarium visum fuit asserere maculam peccati ipsa justitia inherente tanquam forma contraria nullo accedente favore condo natione deleri


xiv
these absurdities doe necessarily follow upon their antichristian doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse for if a man be justified before god by inherent righteousnesse then is he not a sinner in himselfe and consequently hath no sinne in him
and if by infusion of righteousnesse there be a totall deletion of sinne then must that righteousnesse which is infused be perfect
for that which is unperfect cannot wholly expell sinne the imperfection being of it selfe a sinne and if upon infusion of perfect righteousnesse there doth necessarily and of its owne accord follow a totall deletion of sinne then to remission of sinne favour and condonation is needlesse
and yet we have not done with their absurdities for to dreame that men who

are but infants in christianity yea infants in age before they have the use of reason or are capable of habits are endued and that ordinarily with perfect righteousnesse in their first imaginary justification which is inciptentium of such as be but incipients whereunto the best proficients doe not in this life attaine is a monstrous absurdity

cap viii
bellarmines dispute that remission of sinne is the utter deletion of it confuted




bvt how absurd soever their assertion is bellarmine will

maintaine it and set a good face upon it telling us first that wee may not deny it unlesse wee will deny the scriptures
for the scripture saith he useth all manner of words to expresse the true remission of sinne so that if a man would of purpose seeke words to signifie the utter abolition of sinne hee could not devise any which the scripture hath not already used
and to this purpose citeth eighteene testimonies nine out of the old testament viz chron

these places are to be distinguished for either they

sam




when it is attributed to christ our redeemer as in the place alleaged it signifieth that he taketh away our sinnes by taking them upon him or bearing them as it is said of the scape goat the figure of christ levit


and so that place ioh

is to bee

understood
nasa saith one sometimes doth signifie tollere that is to take up and to beare as when we are commanded tollere crucem to take up our crosse or to take upon him which saint iohn the evangelist rendreth by the verbe undefined span alphabet and this is fully expressed by the prophet esay


that christ nasa did beare the sinne of many as before verse
that hee hath borne the verbe is nasa our griefes and carried our forrowes and vers
hee shall beare their iniquities
heb

christ was

once offered ad multorum exhaurienda peccata that is as our rhemists translate to exhaust the sinne of many
the word is undefined span alphabet to take up and to beare the meaning is that christ was offered upon the crosse that he might tak up and beare our sins even as peter speaketh to the like effect epist


who himselfe did beare our sinnes in his owne

body upon the tree that is the crosse where the same verbe is used and is by the latine interpreted pertulit and by the rhemists beare our sinnes


iii
other places are alleaged which mention the deletion

that is the wiping or blotting out of sinne psal


act


esa

but aske from whence delere saith vatablus

est metaphora ab iis qui delent qui prius in rationes scripserant to wipe out is a metaphore from those who wipe out such things as before they had written upon their account or in their
the booke is gods remembrance out of which those things are wiped which are forgotten and thus deletion is often ascribed to

oblivion
for gods wiping out of sins is his blotting them out of his remembrance and so it is expounded es

his not remembring them
psal



ier

as contrariwise his not blotting them out is his remembring of them his not forgiving them
ier

forgive not their iniquity neither

blot out their sinne from thy sight
psal

let the iniquity of his

father be remembred with the lord and let not the sinne of his mother be blotted out ne deleatur id est non tradatur oblivioni but let them be before the lord continually verse
and thus david prayeth psal

hide thy face from my sinnes and blot out all mine iniquities

namely out of thy remembrance and no more can bee gathered out of act


that your sinnes may be blotted out of gods booke where

tremellius noteth it to bee a metaphore taken from those who keepe bookes of account howsoever it is not to be doubted but that before the day of judgement whereof saint peter there speaketh there shall be a totall deletion of the sinnes of the faithful both in respect of the guilt and also of the pollution
as for es

the lord professeth

his reconciliation with israel in taking away their sinnes which as

a cloud yea as a thicke cloud had hid his face from them the guilt whereof being taken away the light of his countenance did shine upon

them
howbeit tremellius and innius read deleo ut densa nubes defectiones tuas according to which reading that place hath affinity with those which mention washing cleansing purging of which am now to speake


iv
of these some are to be understood of justification and taking

away the guilt of sinne as all the first part of the
psalme which is a prayer for the pardon of sinne out of which are cited verse
and
where david prayeth that god would wash him and cleanse him from his sinne namely by the bloud of christ for that is it which

cleanseth us from all our sinnes
purge me with hyssope which was the undefined span alphabet wherewith they used to sprinkle the

bloud upon those which were cleansed that is sprinkle me with the blood of that eternall sacrifice of christ prefigured in the law without which bloud

being shed there was no remission
and there is no doubt but the blood of christ was shod for the remission of sinnes mat

and that our consciencs

the seat of guiltinesse might bee purged from dead workes
the words following and shall bee whiter than snow doe plainely argue the purity not of sanctification for to such a degree thereof we never attaine in this life but of justification in respect whereof our soules being perfectly just are whiter than snow
some are to be understood of sanctification as ezek

some of both as cor

act


ioh

heb

but with this difference that we are cleansed and purged from the guilt of sin past wholly and at once but from the corruption in part and by degrees in this life wherin we are to be renewed

in the inner man from day to day
the corinthians to whom the apostle giveth this

testimony that they were washed were farre from perfection of inherent righteousnesse as appeareth by that epistle wherein he calleth them carnall and reproveth them both for their errours in judgement and for their misdemeanours in their conversation
that which he citeth out of pro

per mifericordiam fidem purgantur peccata is found in the latine
but not in the originall the like sentence is found pro


but there the verbe purgatur for which the text is alleaged is not used in the latine



for the not being of sinne he alleageth psalm


aliàs



quaeretur peccatum illius non inveniatur against the true meaning of the place it being not a prayer for the justification or sanctification of the wicked that his sinne may bee no more as bellarmine absurdly expoundeth it dicet peccatum fuisse non esse but is a propheticall imprecation against the wicked that god would break their arme that is their power and strength and that when he as a judge should inquire into their wickednesse they should not be found according to that prov

he shall be no more that is as augustine expoundeth

it that the wicked when he is judged shall perish for his sinne
and so vatabius make inquiry into his sinne thou shalt not finde him neither

doth the psalmist say non invenietur ipsum scil peccatum sed non invenietur ipse scilicet peccator not it but he shall not be found


vi
for the perfection of righteousnesse hee alleageth three

places two out of ephes

vers
yee were sometimes darkenesse but now light in the lord where the abstract light is put for the concrete lightsome as being inlightned as the children of light not that they are that light in which there

is no darkenesse
neither is it said that we are in our selves light but notwithstanding that darkenesse which remaineth in us wee are light in the lord
the second

place is ephes


where it is said that christ did give himselfe for his church that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that hee might present it to himselfe a glorious church not having spot or wrinckle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish
in which words there is no mention of justification but of sanctification which in this life is begun and increased by the worke of the spirit in the ministery of the word and sacraments that at the marriage of the lambe it may bee presented unto him a glorious church not having spot or wrinckle wherefore augustine

that which said saith he that god hath chosen unto himselfe a glorious church did not therefore speake it because now it is altogether such though no doubt she was chosen that she might be such when christ who is her life shall appeare for en she also with him shall appeare in glory for which glory she is called a glorious church
and againe

wheresoever mentioned the church not having spot or wrinckle it is not so to bee taken as though now it were but because it is prepared to be such when she also shall appeare glorious
and the same answer will serve for the third place cited out of the canticles

tota pulchraes macula non est in te

thou are all faire there is no spot in thee unlesse perhaps he speake of the beauty of the spouse adorned in her justification with the perfect righteousnesse of christ for of her sanctification which is but begun in this life it is not true
but the papists are without shame who apply such texts of scripture to the now church of rome


vii
besides these places of scripture bellarmine saith many

other very weighty arguments might bee brought but hee hath already produced them in his first booke de baptismo cap

which when they shall call come to bee weighed will be found light enough
for those places which speake of the efficacie of baptisme in washing cleansing and taking away our sinnes prove not that in justification sinnes are utterly abolished
for in baptisme is sealed to them that are baptized yea and conferred to the faithfull the benefits not onely of justification but also of sanctification
and therefore as it is the sacrament of remission of sinne and the seale

of that righteousnesse which is by faith so it is called the laver

of regeneration wherein we are baptized into the similitude

of christ his death and resurrection
and therefore though in baptisme sinne were wholly taken away as well in respect of the corruption as of the guilt yet it would not follow that in justification there is a totall deletion of sinne
but neither in baptisme

is there a totall abolition of sin seeing it is manifest that originall sinne which is called the flesh the old man and evill concupiscence remaineth in all the faithfull though in some measure mortified yet never fully and altogether extinguished in this life
and although the papists for maintenance of their severall errors viz of justification by inherent righteousnesse of the perfect fulfilling of the law of merit of works of supererogation doe maintaine that concupiscence remaining in the faithfull after baptisme is not a sinne and the councell of trent

hath denounced anathemà against them that shall say it is a sinne yet it is manifest not onely by the testimony of antiquity and evident reasons which could produce if would runne into another controversie but also by the doctrine of the apostle who doth not onely in many places

expressely call it a sinne and describeth it as a sinne but also setteth it forth as the mother of sinne the sinning sinne which because it taketh occasion by the commandement forbidding lust to worke in men all manner of evill concupiscence is not only convinced to be a sinne but also to be

undefined span alphabet exceedingly sinnefull


viii
and not only habituall concupiscence in generall which is the

body of sinne and the body

of death in respect of which sinne the body of the faithfull is said to be dead rom

is sinne but also the severall members and branches thereof which remaine even in the best are so many habituall sinnes as a spice at the least of pride selfelove carnall security infidelity hypocrisie envy worldly and carnall love of pleasure profit preferment and glory in this world
which though they bee not imputed to the faithfull yet in themselves are sins as being undefined span alphabet swervings from the law of god not onely as defects of righteousnesse which were enough to make them sinnes but as positive vices
neither is it to be doubted but that as the acts of pride and other habituall vices remaining even in the best are sinnes so much more the vices themselves from which they proceed are sinnes and are by the same commandement of the law forbidden
now whatsoever is undefined span alphabet is sinne for as every sinne is undefined span alphabet

so every undefined span alphabet is a sin that being a perfect definition of sinne as bellarmine himselfe confesseth

non potuit rectius brevius definiri peccatum quàm ut ioanne fuit definitum illis verbis undefined span alphabet
but all evill concupiscence both habituall and actuall both in generall the body of sinne and in particular the severall branches being so many habituall sinnes in whomsoever they are found even in the most regenerate are undefined span alphabet aberrations from the law of god
therefore all evill concupiscence whatsoever in whomsoever remaining is a sinne


ix yea but concupiscence is no sinne unlesse the will consent unto

it
then say not a sinne in infants not baptized
but the law doth not say non consenties concupiscentiis sed omninò non concupisces thou shalt not consent to concupiscences but thou shalt not have any evill concupiscence at all
and it is most evident that the concupiscence forbidden in the tenth commandement is such as goeth before the consent of

will
for it is such as saint paul himselfe had not knowne to be sinne if the law had not said

non concupisces thou shalt not covet
but such concupiscences as have the consent of the will the very heathen knew to bee sinnes
and the papists themselves must acknowledge them to be forbidden in the former commandements unlesse they will deny the law of god to be spirituall

and preferre the undefined span alphabet corrupt interpretations of the elders of the iewes before the exposition of the lawgiver himselfe

matth

true therefore is that which some writers cite out of

augustine that originall sinne is remitted in baptisme not that it be not but that it be not imputed unto sin
here bellarmine takes on and saith that luther first falsified this testimony of augustine and that all who have followed him have continued the same fault though they have beene told of it
a great accusation if true
augustines words in answere to an objection which the papists cannot answer how can originall sinne bee transmitted from regenerate parents if in baptisme it be wholly taken from them are these answer saith he dimitti concupiscentiam in baptismo non ut non sit sed ut in peccatum non imputetur
where augustine speaking of the traduction of originall sinne calleth it as his manner is concupiscence in stead whereof some of our writers have said sinne both augustine and they meaning nothing else but originall
now that augustine by that which he calleth concupiscence meant sinne hereby appeareth first he saith it is remitted in baptisme and remission is of debts onely and of sinnes as debts secondly because he saith it is remitted not that it should not bee any longer but that though it be a sinne yet it should not be imputed unto sinne for nothing is wont to be imputed unto sin by god but that which is sinne
where by the way wee may observe that in augustines judgement remission of sinne is not the utter deletion of it that it bee no more but the not imputing of it
for whereas the papists for a poore shift and evasion say that concupiscence is called sinne not because it is a sinne sed quia expeccato est ad peccatum inclinat this hindereth not its being a sinne but rather setteth forth the greatnesse of this evill as having all the respects of evill in it being both a sinne and a punishment of sinne and the cause of all other sinnes a augustine saith

concupiscentia carnis adversus quam bonus concupiscit spiritus sc in renatis peccatum est poena peccati causa peccai



but howsoever bellarmine letteth passe as well he might his other arguments alleaged in his booke of baptisme as impertinent to this present question yet one of them hee hath thought good not to omit as being in his conceit

unanswerable which notwithstanding have not onely answered elsewhere

but also have used it as an invincible argument

to prove justification by imputation of christs righteousnesse viz the argument taken from the antithesis of adam to christ rom

which bellarmine here straineth beyond the extent of the antithesis made by the apostle
in other places bellarmine hath thus argued as through adams disobedience we were made sinners so through christs obedience wee are made righteous but through

adams disobedience we were made truely sinners namely by unrighteousnesse inherent and not onely

by imputation
therefore through the obedience of christ we are made truly righteous namely by righteousnesse inherent
but here to serve his present turne he altereth both the assumption and the conclusion
the assumption for where before he said not onely by imputation here he saith not by imputation
the conclusion for first in stead of concluding that wee are by the obedience of christ made inherently just which we confesse though not intended by the apostle in that place he concludeth that the obedience of christ hath truly taken away and wiped out or abolished all our sinnes
and secondly that he hath taken away our sinnes non imputaivè sed verè not by imputation but truly
his former argument retorted after this manner

as through adams disobedience wee were made sinners that is guilty of death and damnation so by christs obedience wee are made just that is absolved from that guilt and accepted as righteous unto eternall life
but by imputation of adams disobedience we were made sinners
therefore by imputation of christs obedience wee are made righteous

the assumption that we were made sinners by imputation of adams disobedience proved as by other arguments so by bellarmines owne confession in other places
secondly have acknowledged it to bee true that as we are made truely sinners through adams disobedience not onely by imputation of adams sinne but also by transfusion of both that privative and positive corruption which by that ence he contracted so we are made truly just through the obedience of christ not onely by imputation of his obedience but also by infusion of righteousnesse from him
but though we be truly made just by righteousnesse inherent yet it followeth not that we are in this life made perfectly just
neither doth it follow that because christ doth free us from the dominion of sin we are therfore freed wholly from the being of sinne in us neither that if we be freed from sinne by imputation we are not freed truly
for the apostle useth these termes promiscuously remitting of sinne and not imputing of sinne justifying and imputing righteousnesse
and as christ

was truly and really made a sacrifice for sinne in our behalfe so wee are truly and indeed made the righteousnesse of god in him

thus have proved that neither remission of sinne is the abolishing of sinne nor justification all one with sanctification and that the papists by confounding justification and sanctification and of these two making but one have utterly taken away and abolished out of their divinity that great benefit of our justification

a treatise of ivstification
the third booke concerning justification or saving grace
cap what is meant by the word grace in the question of iustification


the second capitall errour of the papists in the

article of justification is concerning justifying and saving grace
for when as the holy ghost would note unto us undefined span alphabet the first moving cause or motive in god the principium or primary cause which some call undefined span alphabet of our justification he saith that we are justified by the

grace of god rom

tit

that wee are saved by his grace ephes


meaning thereby the gracious favour of god in christ whereby undefined span alphabet

he hath graciously accepted and embraced us in his beloved they most absurdly and wickedly that they may place the matter of their justification and merit of their salvation in themselves doe by grace understand the gifts of grace and namely and especially that of charity habitually inherent in us
for so they teach justifying grace to bee a divine

quality inherent in the soule per modum habitus a supernaturall habit infused of god and that not really distinct

from charity
and in like manner what in this kind is said of the

love of god they understand it commonly not of gods love

whereby hee loveth us but of our love whereby wee love god

ii
for the better understanding of this point we are to distinguish

the divers acceptions of gods grace
for either it signifieth the favour of god in himselfe or the gifts of grace in us
the former is the proper signification for the grace of god properly understood is one of gods attributes whereby he is signified to be gracious and is referred to his goodnesse exod

cum

unto which also

his love and mercy are referred but with this distinction
for gods goodnesse is considered either

as hee is good in himselfe yea goodnesse it selfe or as hee is good to his creatures which is his bounty which being referred to his creatures

either as having goodnesse communicated to them is his love or as being in misery is his mercy or as having deserved no good thing at the hands of god but the contrary is his grace
the latter signification is unproper and metonymicall the word grace being taken for the effects of his grace viz his free and undeserved gifts and benefits proceeding from his grace and favour which are not properly called the grace and favour of god but his graces and favours not undefined span alphabet the grace but undefined span alphabet the gifts of grace rom

cor




and in both senses it is either more largely taken for any favour or favours of god though common as both his favour and love in creating preserving and governing his creatures and also the fruits thereof which are his common favours as the gifts of nature in which sense pelagius did call bonum naturae and namely the grace of god and the gifts dispensed by his providence as his temporall blessings which he graciously bestoweth upon both good and bad matth


in which respect hee is not onely said to be channun

gracious exod

and graciously to bestow such gifts gen


esai

but also to bee the saviour of all men tim


yea to save both man and beast psalm


or else it is used more specially to signifie the peculiar favour and favours of god vouchsafed to his peculiar people viz the church tending to the salvation of it and of the members thereof which is the usuall acception of the word in the scripture

iii
this by the schoolemen is very unfitly distinguished into

gratia gratum faciens gratia gratis daa for first out of this distinction that which chiefly and properly is to be called grace viz the gracious love and favour of god in christ is left out
secondly whereas by gratia gratum faciens the justifying and saving grace they meane grace infused and namely the habit of charity they oppose it to gratia gratis data to grace freely given as if the grace infused were not also freely given
but they might have learned either from their master

a better distinction of grace though he doe but lightly touch upon it that grace is either gratia gratis dans gratia gratis data or a better exposition of that distinction which they have propounded according to the scriptures that

by gratia gratum faciens is meant the gracious favour of god in himselfe whereby he graciously accepteth us in his beloved and by gratia gratis data the gifts of grace freely bestowed upon us for so the apostle seemeth to distinguish rom

that it is either

undefined span alphabet the grace of god in himselfe undefined span alphabet or as he speaketh ephes


undefined span alphabet the gift of grace in us

or as elsewhere

undefined span alphabet the grace of god undefined span alphabet the gifts of grace

the former is the gracious favour of god and is in god the giver of all good gifts as the fountaine of all graces the latter are the gifts of grace and are in the receivers as streames derived from that fountaine

now these undefined span alphabet or gifts of grace are either sanctifying graces

tending to the salvation of him who is indued with them as faith hope charity the feare of god or edifying

graces which are given for the salvation of others and those either ordinary as the gifts of the ministery or extraordinary

as the gifts of prophecie of tongues of working miracles which the schoolemen called gratias gratis datas


iv
these undefined span alphabet these gifts of grace whether you understand those edifying or those sanctifying graces may every one of them by a metonymy

be caled undefined span alphabet a grace or by special relatio to some peculiar grace vouchsafed to some particular person undefined span alphabet

this or that grace that is undefined span alphabet this or that git of grace yet none of them can absolutely and properly be called the grace of god or undefined span alphabet

the saving grace of god or gratia gratum faciens of which this question is understood to wit whether this justifying and saving grace of god be inerent in us as a quality or habit or be out of us in god as being one of his attributes
the papists say it is inherent in us per modum habitus after the manner of an habit infused into us and so is the matter of justification considered as an action of god as we conceive of justification or the forme as they say speaking of justification passively and confounding it with sanctification
but we though we doe confesse that in the gifts of saving grace as faith hope charity concurring in us our inward or habituall sanctification doth consist yet we deny them or any one of them to be either the matter or forme of justification
but contrariwise we constantly affirme that the justifying and saving grace of god or as they speake gratia gratum faciens is the gracious favour of god in christ which is out of us in him concurring to our justification neither as the matter nor forme but as the efficient cause thereof
against which assertion the accursed

councell of trent

hath denounced anathema if any man shall say that the grace by which we are justified is onely the favour of god let him be accursed
but first will produce our proofes and then answere their objections

cap ii
our proofes that by the grace of god by which we are justified is meant the gracious favour of god in christ



the papists for all their cursing are not able to

produce any one pregnant testimony to prove that the grace whereby wee are justified is inherent in us
but that grace doth signifie that favour of god wee are able out of the new testament to alleage above fifty testimonies whereof some shall hereafter be cited
and as for the old testament it is evident that the hebrew

words which signifie the grace of god and are to be translated by the word grace doe alwaies signifie favour and never grace inherent
as if have found grace in thy sight gen

ex


god gave ioseph grace in the sight of the keeper gen

and the people of israel grace in the sight of the egyptians exod

in which sense the blessed virgin is said to have found grace with god luk

and our saviour to have increased in grace with god and man luk



ii
secondly that grace whereby the lord undefined span alphabet gratos fecit

made us gracious or graciously accepted us in his beloved is gratia gratum faciens that is the justifying and saving grace

by the gracions love and favour of god in christ which is out of us in him the lord undefined span alphabet hath made us gratious or gratiously accepted us in his beloved and not by any gift of grace inherent in us
therefore the gratious love and favour of god in christ is gratia gratum faciens that is the justifying and saving grace and not any gift of grace inherent in us

the proposition is in it solfe evident
the assumption is proved out of eph
blessed be god who hath blessed us in christ with all spirituall as he hath elected us in him before the foundation of the predestinated us unto the adoption of the praise of the glory of his grace wherein or whereby undefined span alphabet id est gratos fecit hee hath made us accepted in his beloved in whom wee have redemption through his blood even forgivenesse of sinnes according to the riches of his grace verse

for by or in that grace to the glorious praise whereof the lord elected us before the foundation of the world and according to the riches whereof wee are redeemed by christ the lord hath gratiously accepted

us in his beloved
but it were very absurd to say that god hath elected us to the praise of the glory of our charity or that wee are redeemed according to the riches of our charity
but we were elected to the praise of the glory of his grace that is of his gracious love and bounty in christ which grace was given unto us in christ before all secular

times and according to the riches of this grace he hath redeemed us by christ
wherefore gratia gratum faciens the grace by which wee are justified is not any gift of grace inherent in us but the eternall grace and favour of god vouchsafed unto us in christ before the foundation of the world and before all secular times


iii
in respect of this grace whereby the lord undefined span alphabet]graciously

accepted the blessed virgin she is called undefined span alphabet luk

graciously accepted or graced or as it is expounded verse
that she had found grace and favour with god
and so may all the elect and faithfull children of god be called undefined span alphabet as in many places of the old testament they are in the very same sense called chasidim passively understood
especially where that word is read with the affix or pronoune betokening god to signifie his chasidim the favorites of god and thus it is read with the affix of th first person when god is the speaker calling them chasidai

my favourits or of the second whenthe speech is directed unto god and then they are called in the plurall chasideica thy favorits psal







and in the singular chasideca thy favourite deut

psal



or of the third person in the singular chasido his favourite or chasidso

psal

and in the plurall chasidain his favourites
psal









that is as not onely tremellius and iunius but also vatablus interpret it quos benignitate prosequitur those whom god doth specially favour those who have found grace with god which commonly are translated saints and so are all the faithfull usually called even in the new testament

as the translation of the hebrew chasidim sanctity not being the cause of gods favour which is eternall but the proper badge and cognizance of those who are the favorites of god by which they are knowne

and further out of the same place eph

where it is said that by

this grace hee hath made us gracious in his beloved it is plainely proved that by it is meant the gracious favour of god towards us in christ in which respect it is also called the grace of our lord iesus christ
act


so rom

and to the same effect it is called the love of christ rom

that is as it is expressed vers
the love of god which is in christ
which places cannot without absurdity bee understood of that grace of god or of that love of god which is in us that is to say of our love of god


iv
thirdly by what grace of god wee are elected called redeemed reconciled adopted saved by the same wee are justified

but by the gracious favour of god by which hee hath gratiously accepted of us in his beloved and not by any thing in us we were elected according to the undefined span alphabet of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace eph
for which cause our election unto life is called the election of grace rom

by grace wee are effectually called according to

his purpose
for god hath called us with an holy calling not according to our workes but according to his owne purpose of grace which grace was given us in christ iesus before all secular times but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour tim


by his gracious favour in christ god hath redeemed us reconciled us unto himselfe adopted us and not by our charity or any thing in us
and finally by his gracious favor we are saved through faith and not of works or of any grace or righteousnesse iuherent in us that he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindnesse towards us through iesus christ eph

therefore by the gracious favour of god in christ and not by any grace inherent in us the lord doth justifie us and therfore the sacred fathers of trent must take home to themselves according to the censure of the apostle gal



that anathema which they denounce against those who say that the grace whereby wee are justified is onely the gracions favour of god in christ


against the proposition if it bee objected that the grace of

election is eternall but the benefit of vocation and the rest is temporall and therefore not the same answer that although the benefit of vocation and of the rest be given us in time yet the grace by which we are called justified and saved is eternall tim


and therefore bellarmines distinction of grace

into eternall by which wee were elected and temporary by which wee are called and justified is idle and to no purpose


vi
if againe it be objected that by what grace we are sanctified

by the same we are justified by inherent grace we are sanctified therefore by inherent grace we are justified answer by distinction of the phrase by grace for if therby be meant the efficient cause then confesse the proposition to wit that by what grace we are sanctified we are also justified
for the same gracious favor of god is the efficient cause as wel of our sanctification as of our justification and deny the assumption
but if by that phrase be meant the essentiall cuse that is the matter or the forme of our sanctification then confesse the assumption and deny the proposition for by the inherent graces wherin our habitual sanctification consisteth we are sanctified but we are justified not by any grace inherent but onely by the righteousnesse of christ as have shewed before and hereafter shall fully prove in its due place
for wee are justified by the grace that is the gracious favour of god in christ

gratis in respect of us that is without any cause or desert in us through the redemption which is in christ without the works of the law that is without respect of any obedience performed by us or righteousnesse inherent in us that is prescribed in the law which is the perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse


vii
if in the third place it be objected that faith is a grace inherent

but we are justified by faith
or thus faith doth justifie faith is a grace inherent therefore some grace inherent doth justifie
answer againe by distinction that faith doth not justifie as it is a grace or quality inherent or as it is a part of our inherent righteousnesse but relatively as it is the instrument as hath beene said before to receive christ who is our righteousnesse neither doth faith properly but the object thereof which it apprehendeth justifie
as it is the almes properly which releeveth the poore man not the hand which receiveth it
for when we say that a man is justified by faith without workes or by faith alone our meaning is that we are justified by the righteousnes of christ alone which is apprehended by faith onely without respect of any righteousnesse inherent in us or obedieuce performed by us


viii
fourthly the justifying and saving grace is expressed

many times by other words of like signification to the gracious favour of god which cannot be drawne to signifie our charity or any grace inherent in us
as appeareth both by such synonyma as are joyned with it in the same places as grace and love cor

grace and mercie tim


tim


tit

iohn
and also by parallelling other places as where it is said tit

when the grace of god appeared the same is expressed thus chap

when the kindnesse of god and his love towards man appeared
and where in some places

it is said that wee are justified or saved by his grace or according to his grace in others it is said according to his undefined span alphabet his good will and pleasure eph


phil


according to his mercy tit
in which place these foure words are used as synonyma signifying the same thing undefined span alphabet kindnes or bounty undefined span alphabet love of mankind undefined span alphabet mercy undefined span alphabet grace this grace of god is notably expressed eph




by divers words of the like signification
god who is rich in mercie for his great love wherewith he loved us hath when wee were dead in our sinnes quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindnesse towards us through iesus christ for by grace yee are saved through faith here is the riches of his mercie the exceeding riches of his grace his greatlove wherewith hee loved us his bounty towards us in christ and all to set forth his saving grace
so in the old testament mercie and grace are used as words of the like signification
exo

will bee gracious to whom will bee gracious and will shew mercy to whom will shew mercy which text the apostle rendreth thus rom

will have mercy on whom will have mercie and will have compassion of whom will have compassion
exod

where the lord proclaiming his goodnesse or bounty before moses as hee had promised chap

expresseth it in these termes
the lord the lord god mercifull and gracious slow to anger abundant in chesed ve emeth in bounty and truth which in the new testament are translated grace and

truth keeping mercie for thousands forgiving iniquity
so psal

thou lord art a god full of compassion and gracious

long suffering and plenteous in mercie and truth
likewise psal

king


so also psal

the lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy the lord is good to all and his mercies are over all his workes
and in like manner nehem


thou art a god of condonations that is ready to pardon

gracious and mercifull slw to anger and of great bounty


ix fifthly if justifying grace were inherent there would be no

such opposition as the apostle maketh in the question of justification betweene grace and workes as that if wee bee justified by the one wee cannot be justified by the other but they might as well stand together as the first justification of the papists which is habituall consisting in the habits of grace infused with the second which is actuall consisting in works or rather the one would infer the other because we cannot be justified by the one speak of adulti without the other for if wee bee justified by inherent righteousnesse that righteousnesse must be totall and perfect and therfore both habituall and actuall and both must concur unto justification for neither without the other is perfect
object
yea but the apostle when hee saith that faith doth justifie without workes hee speaketh of the first juification unto which works doe not concurre and when hee opposeth grace to workes hee meaneth the works of the law done before faith without grace by the power of nature
answ
this is all that the papists have to excuse themselves that they doe not openly contradict the apostle who so often and so peremptorily concludeth that wee are justified by grace and not by workes by faith without the workes of the law
but it is evident that by the workes of the law is meant all that obedience and righteousnesse that is prescribed in the law which is the perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse
and therefore when the workes of the law are rejected all inherent righteousnesse is excluded from justification
it is also manifest that the holy ghost speaketh generally

of all men whether in the state of nature or in the state of grace and of all workes whether going before or following after faith insomuch that the workes which wee have done in righteousnesse tit

are excluded yea the workes of faithfull abraham are denied to have justified him before god
and therefore those who have both faith and works are justified by faith without workes
but these objectiots shall fully satisfie in their due

place


sixthly whereas the papists say that justifying grace is the same with charity argue thus charity is the fulfilling of the law in our owne persons but wee are not justified by our fulfilling of the law in our owne persons gal




therefore we are not justified by our charity and consequently not by grace inherent


xi seventhly that the apostle by grace in the articles of justification

and salvation understood the gracious favour of god in christ and not inherent grace appeareth both by his assention rom

that

where sinne abounded gods grace did much more abound and by his question rom

shall wee continue in sinne that grace may abound for it were a strange conceit that where sinne aboundeth inherent righteousnesse should abound so much the more
and to these we may adde those places which speake of going to the throne of grace that we may obtaine mercie and find grace heb

of the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindnesse towards us through iesus christ for by grace we are saved eph


of the grace of god and the gift of grace distinguished one from the other rom

of those that beleeve by the grace of god act


of commending men to the grace of god act




of the word of his grace act




of the gospell of his grace act


of the grace of our lord iesus christ who being rich became poore for us cor

of our predestination to the praise of the glory of his grace eph

of the election of grace rom

of the appearing of the grace of god which bringeth salvation tit

of christ his tasting of death for us by the grace of god heb

of the reward not imputed of grace to him that worketh rom

of turning the grace of god into wantonnesse iud



xii lastly so cleare is this truth which wee deliver according

to the scriptures concerning justifying grace that albertus pighius

a famous divine among the papists doth confesse that what the schoolemen teach concerning justifying grace that it is a quality in our soules infused of god and there remaining after the manner of an habit and that it is the same in substance with the habit of charity are meere devises of men having no warrant in the scriptures
thomas aquinas also writing on tit

it is to bee knowne saith he that grace signifieth mercie alwayes was in god yet in respect of men in times past it lay when christ the sonne of god appeared grace it may be said that in the nativity of christ grace appeared two wayes the former because by the greatest grace of god he was given unto upon this grace in the second place followed the instruction of he saith teachingus whereunto we may adde that those few places which bellarmine alleageth for inherent grace are by some of their owne writers understood of the gracious favour of god as we shall shew in the particulars which now we are to examine

chap
iii
bellarmines allegation for grace inherent out of rom

proved to make against himselfe


bvt before propound them am to advertise the reader

that we do not deny that there are divers graces of sanctification and those also necessary to salvation as faith hope charity the feare of god inherent in the soules of the faithfull as divine qualities residing there per modum habitus
so that bellarmine in his booke

de gratia lib arbitr might well have spared his labour whereby he endeavoreth to prove such grace or graces to bee inherent in the soule which never any of us denyed
but wee deny that gratia gratum faciens or justifying grace is inherent in us
this therefore bellarmine laboureth to prove lib
de justif cap


unto which in the other place hee doth referre us alleaging rom

being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in christ iesus answ
it cannot bee denyed but that the popish cause in this particular is very desperate when for the defence thereof they are able to alleage one onely place where grace is mentioned and that such a one as is a most pregnant testimony to prove free justification by faith onely without respect of any righteousnesse or grace inherent in us


ii
and this is proved first by the context or coherence of these words with those which goe before
for thus the apostle reasoneth those that bee in themselves sinners and by their sinne obnoxious to the judgement of god are not justified by righteousnesse inherent all which is prescribed in the law but of necessity must be justified by a righteousnesse which without the law is revealed in the gospell even the righteousnesse of god that is of christ who is god apprehended by faith
but all men without exception both iewes and gentiles are in themselves sinners and by their sinne obnoxious to the judgement of god

therefore seeing all have sinned and are fallen short of the glory of god that is excluded from eternall glory they are not justified by righteousnesse inherent which is prescribed in the law but they are justified by a righteousnesse which without the law is revealed in the gospel to wit the righteousnesse of god that is of christ who is god

apprehended by faith
and that is it which is said in this text that those who have sinned and are fallen short of gods glory and from their title to heaven are justified that is acquitted from their sinnes and entituled unto the kingdome of heaven freely without respect of any grace or righteousnesse in themselves by the meere gracious favor of god when they had deserved the contrary through the redemption that is in christ iesus whom god hath set forth to bee a propitiation through faith in his bloud to declare his righteousnesse

to the same purpose the apostle disputeth gal

as hereafter wee shall heare

iii
secondly it is proved by the words of the text alleaged the

first wherof is undefined span alphabet being justified
now the word undefined span alphabet as have proved heretofore doth never in al the scriptures signifie to make righteous by infusion of righteousnesse and therfore here it is not meant that wee are justified by grace infused
neither doth justification import a reall or positive change in the subject but relative and undefined span alphabet as hath beene shewed
and wee must remember that as it is called so it is justificatio impii

the justification of a sinner not onely because before justification men are sinners but also because being justified they still remaine sinners in themselves though in christ

they are made righteous
and we are to conceive of justification as a continued act of god from our vocation

to our glorification whereby hee doth accept of a beleeving sinner as righteous in christ not onely at his first conversion but also afterwards whiles hee beleeveth in christ though still in himselfe hee bee a sinner
and to that end doth our saviour make continuall intercession for us that the merit of his obedience may be continually imputed unto us

as for the papists they being in their owne conceit justified as they all are after they have beene either baptized in their infancie or absolved when they come to yeares they are no sinners neither is there any thing in them

which god hateth or which may properly bee called sinne
but justification being of sinners and they being no sinners but aying they have no sinne and avouching that hee onely is a just man in whom there is no sinne hereby it appeareth that neither are they justified neither is there any

truth in them

iv
the next word is undefined span alphabet which is an exclusive particle excluding the false causes of justification and signifying that wee are justified without any desert or worthinesse in our selves without works without respect of any righteousnesse inherent in us which directly overthroweth the assertion of the papists for proofe whereof this place was alleaged


the third word is undefined span alphabet by his grace that is by the gracious

favour of god in christ which is out of us in him as hath beene proved that is by his love of us and not by our love of him
neither is there any shew of reason why it should in this place above all others signifie as it never doth an habit of justifying grace inherent in us especially if that bee true which hereafter shall plainely demonstrate

that wee are not justified by that which is inherent
and thus saint ambrose expoundeth these words gratia dei gratis justificati sunt gratis quia nihil operantes neque vicem reddentes sola fide justificati sunt dono dei they are justified freely because neither working before their justification nor rendring any recompence after their justification they are by faith onely justified by the grace that is as he expoundeth it the gift of god
and on those words by the redemption which is in christ iesu he testifieth

saith hee that the grace of god is in christ but not in us because by the will of god we were redeemed by christ
pererius likewise a learned iesuit the name of grace saith he

when it is here said justified freely by his grace though it may signifie that supernaturall and divine quality infused into the soule of man and inherent therein yet rather it seemeth in this place to signifie gratuitam dei bnitatem benignitatem erga hominem the free or gracious goodnesse and bounty of god towards man
grace therefore doth not signifie either the matter or the forme but the efficient cause of our justification


vi
the fourth word is through the redemption that is in christ iesus

whereby is meant christs whole satisfaction made to the law both in respect of the precept and of the penalty by which being as the papists themselves confesse imputed unto us we are redeemed and justified as being the matter and merit of justification


vii
the fifth word is by faith whereby is noted the instrument

by which we apprehend and receive that satisfaction or righteousnesse of christ by which we are justified which is indeed out of us in him but imputed to those that beleeve
the righteousnesse therefore by which we are justified is the righteousnesse of faith that is the righteousnesse of god or of christ apprehended by faith


viii
the sixth and last is the end why god did give his sonne

to be a propitiation for our sinnes to shew forth his righteousnesse for the remission of sinnes and that hee might bee just and the justifier of him which beleeveth in iesus
for in the worke of our redemption and justification gods justice is declared to be such that he forgiveth no sinnes but those onely for which his justice is satisfied by christ neither doth he justifie any but those whom by communication of christs righteousnesse unto them he maketh just
but how should the satisfaction of christ that is his obedience and sufferings being transient and so long agoe performed bee communicated unto us for our justification otherwise but by imputation and if wee bee justified by imputation of christs righteousnesse then not by inherent grace or infused righteousnesse

cap iv
bellarmines dispute out of rom

refuted



now let us see what bellarmine inferreth upon this

place
here saith he all the causes almost of justification are set forth together
the efficient cause is noted in the word gratis freely importing the liberality of god the formall cause in the word grace the meritorious cause in the word redemption the disposing cause in the word faith all of them almost depraved or misapplyed by bellarmine
for neither is the true efficient cause undefined span alphabet which he calleth vocabulo nimis diluto gods liberality signified by the word gratis but the false undefined span alphabet or meritorious cause is by this word excluded and the true undefined span alphabet]· which is the merit of christ included in the word redemption
as if he had said we are justified grats in respect of us that is without any cause or desert in us without any worthinesse of ours but not gratis in respect of christ by whose pretious death and merits we are justified
neither by grace is meant iustice given and infused of god which hee saith is the formall cause of justification but the grace of god as have shewed signifieth the gracious favour of god which is not the formall cause of justification but the undefined span alphabet the efficient or moving cause
neither is redemption passively understood the meritorious cause of our justification for that as well as reconciliation or justification it selfe is the undefined span alphabet the fruit and effect of christ his death and obedience which as they are the matter and meritorious cause of our justification so also the price and merit of our redemption
how then are we said to be justified through the redemption that is in christ iesus either by a metonymy of the effect for the cause redemption being put for christs satisfaction or paying of a price of ransome for us by which we were redeemed or else we are said to be justified by his redemption as we may be said to be justified by remission of sinnes
for by christ wee have redemption that is remission of sinnes col

ephes


and so occumenius expoundeth these words by the redemption undefined span alphabet
but how is he justified by the forgivenesse of sinnes which wee obtaine in christ iesu
neither is faith the disposing cause as he saith for then a man might have a true lively justifying faith and not bee actually justified which is contrary to the scriptures act


ioh



but the instrumentall cause which is therefore said

to justifie because the object which it receiveth doth justifie in which sense the same benefits which wee receive from christ are ascribed to faith
now the object of faith being the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him it is evident that when wee are said to bee justified by faith it is meant that wee are not justified by righteousnesse inherent but by that righteousnesse which faith doth apprehend


ii
yea but bellarmine will prove by divers arguments that

grace in this place doth not signifie the gracious favour of god first because the favour of god was sufficiently signified by the word gratis
for hee that justifieth freely doth it out of good will and liberality therefore that addition by grace doth not signifie the favour it selfe but some thing else that is to say the effect of that favour
answere that the greeke word undefined span alphabet and the hebrew chinnam is a particle exclusive of any cause price worth or desert in us which may be shewed by many examples
where it signifieth first without cause or desert as where it is said they hated me undefined span alphabet that is without any cause in me or desert of mine ioh

ex psalm


and vers
where symmachus readeth undefined span alphabet psalm


so ezech


sam




king


psalm




lam

secondly freely without paying any price as exod

numb

sam


esai


mat

apoc



so that this exclusive particle was inserted not to set downe the true cause of justification but to exclude the false that we are justified freely without any cause in us or desert of ours or price paid by us meerely by the grace of god through the redemption which is in iesus christ
and thus is the word expounded by all writers almost both old and new and those as well papists as protestants

ambrose as you heard gratis saith he quia nihil operantes nec vicem reddentes sola fide justificati sunt dono dei freely because working nothing nor making any recompence they are justified through faith alone by the gift of god

augustin prorsus gratis das gratis salvas qui nihil invenis unde salves multum invenis unde damnes altogether freely thou givest and freely thou savest because thou findest nothing for which thou shouldest save and thou findest much for which thou maist condemne

oecumenius undefined span alphabet freely that is without any good deeds of thine thou art saved and

againe as bringing nothing else but faith and after because all have sinned therefore all that beleeve in christ are justified freely

bringing onely faith to their justification
hugo cardinalis glossa interlin gratis sine meritis
so thomas aguinas and other popish writers yea

bellarmine himselfe to bee justified freely is to bee justified without merit without workes
this particle therefore sheweth not by or for what wee are justified but by or for what wee are not justified

iii
his second reason because the preposition per when it is said per gratiam being not a note as hee saith of the efficient cause is not rightly applied to the favour or good will of god which is the efficient cause but either to the formall cause or to the meritorious cause or to the instrument
for wee could not well say that god doth justifie us per favorem aut per suam benevolentiam

by his favour or by his good will but wee say well by grace inherent though not very well by his grace inherent for that which is inherent is ours though from him by the merit of his sonne by faith by the sacraments

first answere that the preposition is not in the originall text where the apostle doth not say undefined span alphabet as noting in bellarmines conceit the formall cause but undefined span alphabet as noting the antecedent or moving cause which is principium actionis as is usuall in the like actions which the efficients working per se are done naturâ arte consilio or voluntate in which wee doe not say per naturam per artem
and therefore this objection is very frivolous
secondly answer that per in latine and undefined span alphabet in greeke are very often applyed to the efficient cause whereof even in the new testament there are as suppose more examples than there bee leaves whereof some are attributed to god as rom

gal


heb
to the sonne ioh

col

heb

and to omit other examples which are innumerable to the attributes of god which are the prime motive causes of all his actions as by the will of god cor

thirdly to bellarmine in this

place denying the preposition per to be rightly applied to the efficient cause oppose bellarmine

in the twelfth chapter of the same booke affirming that the particle per doth signifie the cause efficient as pro

per me reges regnant

his third argument
the good will of god cannot bee in vaine but alwayes performeth and worketh that good which hee willeth to any
for whatsoever he willeth that he doth psal
answ
all this is true in respect of his will decreeing any thing which is absolute

and is called voluntas beneplaciti but not in respect of his will prescribing or requiring any thing which is conditionall and is called voluntas signi of which will the apostle speaketh in the place cited by bellarmine th

this is the wil of god even your sanctification
otherwise by bellarmines argument all men should bee holy because as hee saith god would have them truely just and holy
therfore saith he if justifying grace be the favour and goodwill of god and god doth not favour nor wish well in vaine but maketh us holy and blamelesse such as he would have us to bee then it followeth that to be justified by grace is not onely to bee reputed just and not to bee so but to be truly just holy and blamelesse
answ
this argument doth not prove the particular point for which it is brought namely that by grace is meant grace inherent and not the gracious favour of god
but if it were ought worth it would serve to prove the maine question that although grace did signifie the favour of god when it is said that wee are justified by his grace yet this place would prove that wee are also made just by grace inherent
for whom the lord favoureth and wisheth well unto his benevolence is not in vaine to him but to whom hee

willeth good hee worketh it making them truely just and holy whom by his grace hee justifieth
for hee hath elected us that wee might bee holy eph

and this is his will our anctification
all this wee freely confesse that whom god justifieth he maketh just first by imputation and truly and perfectly as hee justifieth secondly by infusion as hee sanctifieth
but the papists must at length learne to distinguish betwixt justification and sanctification
for as wee have said before wee are justified by grace as it signifieth the gracious favour of god onely but wee are sanctified not onely by his gracious favour as the efficient but also by his graces infused and inherent in us as the matter



his fourth argument consisteth of sixe slender proofes put together which are scarce worth the answering
that justifying grace aith hee is not onely the favour of god but a gift inherent in the soule it may bee understood by the divers attributes and names thereof
as first that it is called a gift a gift which wee receive a gift given by christ a gift given by measure
secondly that it is compared to essence
thirdly that it is compared to light

to the first answere that the gracious love and favour of god is said in the scriptures to bee given that is vouchsafed unto us even the grace whereby wee were elected and predestinated to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by which wee are called justified and saved tim


god hath saved and called us with an holy calling not according to our workes but according to his owne purpose and grace which grace was

given us in christ iesus before secular times having thereby graciously accepted us in his beloved eph

behold saith

saint iohn how great love the father hath

given us that wee should be called the children of god ioh

for to so many as received christ hee gave

power to bee the sonnes of god even to them that beleeve in his name ioh



vi yea but it is such a gift as wee doe receive
very like for giving

and receiving are relatives and therefore what god giveth us we doe receive namely as hee giveth it but hee doth not give all things by infusion and therefore hereof it doth not follow that what we receive in inherent but that onely which hee giveth by way of infusion
now hee hath vouchsafed us his grace whereby hee elected redeemed adopted justified us not by infusion but by acceptation in christ which grace wee receive by the hand of faith and whom hee hath graciously accepted in his beloved they are undefined span alphabet made partakers of that grace which notwithstanding is in god and not in them
but let us consider his proofe rom

receiving the abundance of grace and of the gift os righteousnesse
answ
by grace here is meant gracious favor neither doth the apostle here say the gift of grace but the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousnesse
for where these two are joyned together grace and gift grace signifieth gracious favour the gift of grace the fruit and effect of that favour being some benefit bestowed whether reall or relative
the former is undefined span alphabet the grace of god the latter is properly undefined span alphabet
and this is prooved out of the
verse where is mention

both of the grace of god and of the gift by grace and that which is here called the abundance of grace and vers
the abounding grace is elsewhere called the superabundant riches of his grace ephes


that is of his gracious favour which in the same chapter to the romans vers
is said to have superabounded where sinne did abound which without great absurdity cannot bee understood of grace inherent
neither is the gift of grace or of righteousnesse here mentioned inherent but this undefined span alphabet which came upon us to justification is opposed to undefined span alphabet guilt which came upon all men undefined span alphabet unto condemnation that is to say the merit of christs obedience opposed to the guilt of adams fall· as the whole context doth prove
but as wee were made sinners by adams fall the guilt thereof being imputed unto us so we are made righteous by christs obedience the merit thereof being imputed unto us


vii
yea but it is a gift given by christ
it is very true for in and by

christ all grace and favour is vouchsafed unto us for in him hee hath graciously accepted

us
and therefore as it is called the grace of god so in many places it is called the grace of christ not onely because in and by him it is granted to us but also because he doth bestow it
but doth it hereof follow that this grace is inherent what spirituall favour or grace tending to salvation hath god vouchsafed unto us otherwise than in and by christ in him he vouchsafed us grace

in generall and in particular the grace of election for in him wee were chosen ephes

and how is this proved which no man doubteth of that grace is given by christ because it is said ioh

gratia veritas per iesum christum facta est grace and verity was made by isus christ where leaving his hold that it is given he urgeth as if he had forgot himselfe the phrase facta est is made for saith he it is not well said that the favour and benevolence of god is made


viii
answ
the word in the originall is undefined span alphabet which doth

not alwayes signifie was made but many times is expressed by the verbe substantive fuit or extitit as mark

undefined span alphabet the word became flesh so mark

and sometimes by the verbe came and that in the sense either of happening rom

tim


or of growing matth

or of being present ioh

now the sense of the word varying it is to be fitted to the place wherein it is used but the sense that grace and truth was made by christ fitteth not
but either we are to say extitit it was by christ as valla and sometimes beza translated undefined span alphabet or that it came by him as our translation readeth or that it was exhibited

or given by christ as the law both

morall shewing sinne and denouncing the curse opposed to grace and also ceremoniall consisting of shadowes and types opposed to truth was

given by moses
and thus bellarmine himselfe understood this place for to prove that grace was given by christ he alleaged this text
but though grace and truth were given by christ doth it follow that therefore grace doth signifie grace inherent or if it did that that inherent grace is justifying grace howbeit the true meaning of the word is either according to the proper signification which is most usuall especially when these two chased and emeth grace and truth goe together or because grace and truth given by christ are opposed to the law given by moses by grace and truth wee may understand the doctrine of grace and truth
for as the doctrine of grace that is to say the gospell which is the word of grace

ix fourthly he alleageth that this grace is given by measure from

christ himselfe ephes


to every one of us grace is given according to the measure of the donation of christ
but the favour of god saith hee is not given by measure nor by christ
answ
this place is not understood of justifying grace which is the gracious favour of god in christ which is out of us in him but of the severall gifts of grace in us which by a metonymy are called graces but properly undefined span alphabet as oecumenius upon that place hath well observed undefined span alphabet to every one is given grace that is a gift of grace whether they bee the graces of sanctification which are the proper fruits of saving grace or those which by the schoolemen are called gratiae gratis datae of which the apostle seemeth to speake in that place as hee explaineth himselfe in the verses following vers

in which sense the apostle peter useth the words undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet pet


as every one hath received undefined span alphabet a gift of grace even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god
of these gifts of grace it is true which bellarmine saith that they are given

by christ and that they are given by measure
but will hee from thence prove that what grace is either given by christ or in measure is not gods favour had thought that the saving grace of god according to his last allegation out of ioh

had beene given by christ and that it is from the father through the sonne by the holy ghost
and therefore as it is called the grace of

god who is the god of all grace pet


so also the grace of our lord iesus christ

and the grace of the holy spirit who is the spirit of grace

and had also thought that the favour of god though not that which justifieth is in divers degrees vouchsafed unto his creatures

psal



to which purpose

saith wel god loveth all things which he hath made and among them he loveth more the reasonable creatures and among them hee loveth more amply those who are the members of his onely begotten sonne and much more his onely begotten himselfe the sonne of his love
and generally by how much the better any man is than others it is an evidence that hee is so much graced and favoured of god the grace and favour of god being the cause of their goodnesse and consequently the greater favour of greater goodnesse


fifthly it is saith he compared to essence which is given by creation hence it is that we are said to be created in christ eph

and to be a new creature gal


but that by which we are called creatures is inward and inherent in us
answ
that whereby wee are created anew according to the image of god in true holinesse and righteousnesse is the grace not of justification for wee are created to good workes which in the same place are opposed to grace and are excluded from justification

but of regeneration and sanctification which we acknowledge to be inwardly wrought by the holy spirit in those that are justified by the gracious favour of god through faith
but who would thinke that the papists were so blinded with malice as either to perswade themselves or to goe about to perswade others that wee deny the graces of sanctification to bee inherent and affirme that wee are sanctified by such a righteousnesse or holinesse as is without us


xi finally saith he it is compared to light cor

what followship hath light with darkenesse eph

ye were sometimes darkenesse but now you are light in the lord
ioh

he that saith that hee is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkenesse
but light doth not make a body lucidum unlesse it be inherent neither doth it suffer darkenesse with it
how then a justified man bee said not onely to be ucidus lightsome but also light in the lord whereas before he was darke if still the darkenesse of sinne be inherent him and the light of grace abide without
answ
wee are called light in the abstract by a metonymie either because we are in the light which is not inherent in us being either god or the favor of god which is the state of grace or because of that light which is in us which is the grace not of justification but of regeneration and is compared to light both in respect of the inward illumination of the soule and also of the externall sanctification of the life shining forth to others of which our

saviour speaketh mat

let your light viz of your godly conversation so shine before men that they seeing your good workes may glorifie your father that is in heaven
but where he saith there can be no darkenesse in him that is light it is as much as if hee should say that there can be no sinne in him that is sanctified
but he should remember that god alone is light in whom there is no darkenesse ioh

and that in the best of us there is darkenesse that is the flesh even a body of sin and of death as well as light that is the spirit gal


rom

and that hee who saith hee hath no sinne which is the case of all justified yea of all baptized and of all absolved and absolute papists he is a iyar and there is no truth in him
ioh

and this was his fourth argument containing sixe petite proofes

chap

his fifth argument from rom

answered




for having no more places where grace is named to proove justifying grace to bee inherent hee flyeth to rom

where not grace but the love of god is mentioned
that grace saith he wherby the apostle saith wee are justified is said also to be charity diffused in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us
the words are because the love of god or gods love is effused or powred forth
but here now the question is first whether by the love of god in this place is meant the love whereby god loveth us or that love whereby wee love god
and secondly if that love of god whereby wee love him should be meant how is it proved that that love of ours is gods justifying grace for this latter though wee constantly deny it bellarmine goeth not about to prove but taketh for granted it being the maine point in question which cannot be proved out of this or any other place
as touching the former our divines doe hold that by gods love in this place is meant that love whereby god loveth us and not that whereby wee love god the papists hold the contrary which bellarmine endeavoreth to proove by the testimony of

augustine and two weake proofes out of rom


ii
the testimony of augustine hee urgeth very sophistically as if wee had no better proofe to oppose to the testimony of saint augustine than the authority of our owne writers or as if we might not differ from augustine in expounding some place of scriptures unlesse we will preferre our selves before him when notwithstanding the popish writers

in expounding the scriptures differ from augustine as oft as wee
but to the testimony of augustine who saith that the love which is said to bee shed in our hearts is not that love whereby god loveth us but that whereby we love god we oppose first the authority of those writers who understand this place of the love of god both actively wherewith he loveth us which is the same with his saving grace and also passively whereby he is loved of us which is a notable fruit of his saving grace or of either of them both indifferently as orign sedulius haymo anselmus remigius bruno thomas aquinas dominicus soto pererius disput

in rom
cornelius lapide secondly the authority of those who understand this love to be that wherewith god loveth us
as of

ambrose who saith wee have the pledge of gods love in us by the holy ghost given unto that the promise is faithfull the holy ghost given to the apostles and to us doth prove and doth confirme our hope and that he might commend the love of god in us that because it is impossible that those who are beloved should be deceived he might make us secure concerning the promise because both it is god who hath promised and they are deare to him to whom he hath promised
of

chrysostome who saith undefined span alphabet whom theophylact followeth from that love which god sherved towards us
of oecumenius undefined span alphabet out of the love of god alone wherewith he loved us of hierom and likewise of primatius quomodo nos deus diligat ex hoc cognoscinous how god doth love us hereby wee know
to these from among the popish writers we may adde cardinal

cajetan who saith the apostle manifesteth the solid foundation of hope from the love of god towards us and againe

whereby it appeareth that he setteth forth the love of god towards us as the chiefe foundation of hope
cardinal tolet charitatem dei appellat qua diligit nos deus he calleth it the love of god wherewith hee loveth us

arias montanus that our hope is rooted in that love wherewith god hath loved us


iustitian who expoundeth the words thus because that divine charity wherewith god imbraced us is shed into our hearts


iii
thirdly wee oppose evident reasons from the whole context that is not onely from the words of the text it selfe but also from those which either goe before or follow after
for first touching the words of the text by the holy spirit is meant the spirit of adoption as bellarmine confesseth in his next proofe viz that the apostle speaking rom

de hoc ipso spiritu of this selfe same spirit saith you have received the spirit of adoption who is then said to shed abroad gods love in our hearts when he doth perswade our soules of gods love towards us in christ testifying with our spirits that wee are the sonnes of god

and making us to cry in our hearts abba father with whom being the spirit of promise

and the earnest of our inheritance so many as beleeve are sealed unto the day of our ull redemption
thus by sealing unto our soules the assurance of gods love he is said to shed abroad the love of god in our hearts secondly that love

of god which he sheddeth abroad in our hearts and sealeth unto us as the ground whereupon our sound hope which never maketh ashamed is founded is gods eternall and immutable love from the assurance whereof sealed unto us by the holy ghost our assured hope doth flow
and therefore if we speake as the apostle here doth of such a love of god as is both the object of our faith and the ground of our hope we must say with saint

iohn herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his sonne to be the propitiation for our sinnes
for that is it whereby especially god hath commended this his love towards us as it is here said vers
and as saint iohn also saith in the same place ioh

in this was manifested the love of god towards us because god sent his onely begotten sonne into the world that we might live through him
as for us wee love god because he loved us first ioh

for when we are by the holy ghost shedding abroad the love of god in our hearts perswaded of gods love towards us in christ then and never till then our hearts are inflamed to love god againe and our neighbour for gods sake
but why is this love of god said to be shed forth in our hearts for this some doe urge
answere either in respect of the knowledge and assurance thereof wrought in us by the holy ghost as have said for therefore the holy ghost is given unto us that we might know

undefined span alphabet the things freely given or vouchsafed unto us of god among which the principall is his love or as those of the church of rome who consent with us in this point do speak it is said to be effused either as the cause is said to be effused by the effects which are the gifts proceeding from gods love the chiefe whereof is the spirit which is given unto us even the spirit of adoption which as chrysostome saith upon this place is undefined span alphabet the greatest gift or as the bounty of a prince is shed abroad by his almoner distributing the princes goods for even so the love and gracious bounty of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the spirit of grace the dispenser of gods gifts unto us cor



iv
in the words going before the apostle setteth downe the

fruits of justification by faith first that being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord iesus christ secondly by him we have through faith accesse into this grace wherein wee stand or as the apostle speaketh ephes


by him we have boldnesse and accesse with confidence through faith in him thirdly joy in the holy ghost rejoycing in hope of the glory of god
and in these three the kingdome of grace consisteth viz in righteousnesse peace and joy in the holy ghost rom

and this joy the apostle amplifieth because we glory and rejoyce in hope of glory not onely when all things goe with us according to our minds but also in affliction and tribulation
knowing that affliction being sanctified to them who have peace with god worketh patience and patience worketh probation undefined span alphabet that is as chrysostome very well expoundeth it undefined span alphabet it maketh him approved who is tryed for by patient bearing of afflictions which are undefined span alphabet tryals a man is by experience found to bee undefined span alphabet that is a

sound and upright christian as saint iames

saith and when hee is so found hee shall receive the crowne of life
and therefore hath cause to hope as saint paul here saith that probation worketh hope and the hope of him that is undefined span alphabet maketh not ashamed whereas contrariwise the hope of the hypocrite maketh him ashamed but what is the ground of all this how come wee to have this peace this confidence this joy this undaunted hope can wee have it by the bare assent of faith without application or desire thereof which is the onely faith which the papists acknowledge can wee have it by our owne charity when wee cannot know as the papists teach that we have charity nothing lesse but the ground and foundation of all our peace and comfort is this because the spirit of god teaching those that beleeve to apply the promises of the gospell to themselves which cannot be done without special faith the love of god is shed forth into their hearts that is by the spirit of adoption sealing those that do beleeve they are perswaded in some measure assured of the eternall love of god towards them in christ upon which doe follow peace of conscience accesse with confidence and joy in the holy ghost
conclude with chrysostome

undefined span alphabet saith hee the apostle having said that hope maketh not ashamed hee ascribeth all this not to our good workes but to the love of god not that whereby wee love him for that is our chiefe undefined span alphabet good works but that wherby he loveth us



now let us come to the words which follow which as cornelius

lapide confesseth valde favent doe very much favour our exposition wherein the apostle sheweth how this love of god whereon our hope is grounded is both manifested and assured unto us
it is manifested by this verse
that when wee were of no strength yea dead in our sinnes the son of god dyed for us for so saith the apostle eph

god who is rich in mercie for his great love wherewith he loved us even when wee were dead in our sinnes hath quickened us together with christ by whose grace wee are saved which wonderfully setteth forth the love of god towards us for scarcely as it is vers
for a righteous man will one dye
and greater love no man hath than this that a man lay downe his life for his friend ioh

but god saith the apostle vers
commendeth his love towards us even that love mentioned verse
in that whiles wee were yet sinners and by our sinnes his enemies christ dyed for us
it is assured by an argument from the

lesse to the greater
for if when we were sinners we were redeemed and justified by the bloud of christ much more being justified wee shall be saved from wrath through him
for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his sonne much more being reconciled wee shall bee saved by his life
conclude therefore that notwithstanding the testimony of augustine which as himselfe

confesseth deserveth no credit further than it is warranted by the authority of gods word or sound reason by the love of god in this place is meant gods love towards us
come to his two other arguments


vi
the former which is a very weake one is by paralleling

that place with rom

for saith hee the same apostle speaking of the same spirit given unto us saith you have received the spirit of adoption of sonnes by which we cry abba father
now saith hee wee cry abba father by that charity whereby we love god not by that whereby he loveth us
which reason if it bee reduced into a syllogisme will not conclude his assertion but the erroneous opinion of lombard

the master of sentences which bellarmine

himselfe elsewhere confuteth namely that the charity whereby wee love god is the holy ghost

that whereby wee cry in our hearts abba father is the holy ghost
by that charity wherewith wee love god we cry in our hearts abba father therefore that charity wherewith wee love god is the holy ghost

this conclusion bellarmine knoweth to bee false
therefore either the proposition is false or the assumption for it is impossible that a false conclusion should bee inferred from true premisses in a formall syllogisme as this is
but the proposition is the apostles both rom

and gal


therefore the assumption is false
neither is charity that fruit of the holy ghost whereby the spirit of adoption causeth us to cry abba father but faith
for although by charity wee may bee declared or knowne to bee the sonnes of god yet wee become the sonnes of god not by charity but by faith ioh

gal


and consequently not by charity but by faith wrought in us by the spirit of adoption testifying with our spirits that wee are the sonnes of god the said spirit maketh us to cry in our hearts abba father


vii
his second proofe is out of rom

where it is said that

by justifying grace we doe live
the body indeed is dead by reason of sinne spiritus autem vivit propter justificationem as the vulgar latine readeth but the spirit liveth because of justification
but wee cannot well be said to live by the externall favour of god seeing nothing is more inward than life
answ
in this argument nothing is sound for first it proveth not the point for which it is brought viz that by the love of god rom

is meant our love of god
neither is it said rom

that wee live by justifying grace for neither is justifying grace mentioned but undefined span alphabet justice neither is it said that we live by it though it bee true that by justifying faith we live but that the spirit is life propter justificationem for or by reason of righteousnesse
and further it is well said that our spirit liveth the spirituall and eternall life by the gracious favour of god which is out of us in him by which wee are saved as also for and by reason of the righteousnesse and merits of christ which also are out of us in him
neither doth it follow that because life is inward that therefore it propter quod for which or by reason whereof wee doe live should also be inward


viii
but to let passe his impertinent allegation of this place

and to explaine the true meaning thereof which is to set downe in this verse and that which followeth two priviledges of those in whom christ

dwelleth by his spirit the one in respect of the soule vers
that howsoever by reason of sinne the body is dead that is mortall or subject to death yet the soule is life that is designed unto life by reason of righteousnesse
the other in respect of the body vers
that if christ dwell in us by his spirit then hee which raised up christ from the dead shall also by the same spirit quicken that is raise up unto life eternall our mortall bodies
now as our bodie is dead that is subject to death by reason of adams sinne in whom as the roote all sinned so our soule is life or intituled to life by reason of christs righteousnesse in whom as our head wee satisfied the justice of god the sinne of the first adam and the righteousnesse of the second being both communicated unto us by imputation
and this is all that bellarmine hath alleaged to prove that justifying grace is inherent all which is as good as nothing

cap vi
the use of the word grace in the writings of the fathers


having shewed how the word grace is used in the

scriptures something is to be added concerning the use thereof in the writings of the fathers whose authority the papists are wont to object against us
howbeit as in the scriptures so also in the fathers there are two principall significations of the word grace the one proper signifying the gracious favour of god in christ by which they acknowledge us to be elected called justified and saved
the other metonymicall signifying the gift of grace and namely the grace of regeneration or sanctification which in the scriptures is called the spirit opposed to the flesh and the new man or new creature which is renewed and as it were recreated according to the image of god in true holinesse and righteousnesse

of this grace of sanctification there is more frequent mention in the fathers who wrote against the pelagians than of the other
because the pelagians acknowledging the grace of god in forgiving sinnes which is indeed the justifying and saving grace they had not the like occasion to insist upon the declaration and proofe thereof as they had of the other which the pelagians denyed


ii
of whose errors in this point there were foure degrees

for first they acknowledge no other inward grace of god but bonum

naturae the possibility of nature and the power of which because it is freely given of god without any precedent merits of ours they acknowledged to bee gods grace
in the second place they acknowledged the grace that is the gracious favour of god in forgiving sinnes but the inward vertue avoid sinnes and to walke in obedience they ascribed to the power of nature
thirdly for our direction and instruction how and what sinnes to avoid and how and what duties to performe they acknowledged gods grace in teaching and instructing us by his word and by his law
fourthly they acknowledged after a sort the helpe of grace for the more easie performance of their duties but they denied the necessity thereof because without grace they being directed by the word were able of themselves though not so easily to fulfill the law


iii
these three latter degrees are condemned by so many decrees of the councell of milevis among which this is one

denouncing anathema against such as shall say that the grace of god whereby wee are justified through our lord iesus christ doth availe onely to remission of sinnes which are already committed and not for a helpe that we may not commit them unto which rightly understood we doe subscribe acknowledging that by the same grace of god by which we were elected redeemed called reconciled adopted justified wee are also sanctified for wee professe that our blessed saviour was given unto us of god

not onely to bee our justification and redemption but also to be our sanctification
and we doe acknowledge that in the covenant of grace

the lord hath not onely promised remission of sinnes to those that beleeve in christ but hee hath also sworne

that he will give us being redeemed and having remission of sinne to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the daies of our life
and therefore we do also willingly subscribe to those sentences of augustine which gratian hath transcribed into the third part of his decree

no man taketh away sinnes but christ alone who is the lambe of god taking away the sinnes of the he taketh them away both by forgiving those that are already committed among which originall sinne is contained and also by helping that they bee not committed and by bringing us unto life where they cannot bee committed at all
and againe

the grace which by our lord iesus christ is given is neither the knowledge of the divine law neither nature nor remission of sinnes alone but it felfe also causeth that the law be fulfilled that nature be freed that sinne raigne not
and this

presume is as much as can truely bee alleaged out of the fathers for seeing they doe hold as wee shall hereafter shew justification by faith onely it cannot bee imagined that they held justification properly understood by inherent graces unlesse wee can imagine that they thought there is no inherent grace but faith onely


iv
but howsoever the fathers may be excused who opposing

the errors of the pelagians which oppugned the sanctifying grace did much insist upon the declaration the proofe and the amplification

thereof oftner speaking of this gift of grace which was oppugned than of the gracious favour of god in forgiving of sinnes which the pelagians did confesse yet the backsliding posterity cannot bee excused and that in three respects
for first they leave out altogether the proper signification of grace which is most frequent in the holy scriptures as if there were no other grace to bee acknowledged but that which is inherent
secondly they take away that grace of remission which the pelagians did confesse and in the roome thereof they have brought in an utter deletion or abolition of sinne caused by the infusion of grace
thirdly that grace which they would seeme so much to magnifie is not much better acknowledged by them than it was by the pelagians
for first they doe not acknowledge it to be a quickning and reviving grace to them that are dead but an healing grace to the sicke and a helping grace to the weake
and by how much they extoll the power of nature and lessen the foulenesse of originall sinne so much they extenuat the benefit of grace and are as well as the pelagians worthily termed the enemies of gods grace secondly there seemeth to be little or no difference betweene the pelagians bonum naturae which they acknowledged to bee gods grace and that sufficient grace which the papists hold to be common to all
thirdly neither is there any great difference betweene them in respect of that grace whereby men are called
for the pelagians acknowledged the great grace of god in revealing his will unto us and in directing us what to doe and what to beleeve and withall confessed that god doth worke in us to will by revealing his will to us
and what doe the papists acknowldge more but that god having called us by his word and moved us to turne unto

him it is in the power of our either to accept gods effectuall grace or to refuse it
but this belongeth to another controversie

a treatise of stification
the fovrth booke of the matter of justification
cap
the state of the question concerning the matter of justification it being the principall point in controversie


the third capitall errour of the papists in the question

of justification is concerning that righteousnesse whereby we are justified where for prevention of popish calumniations must desire the reader to remember three things first that the controversie is not concerning our sanctification but concerning our iustification for wee confesse that our habituall sanctification consisteth in our righteousnesse inherent and actuall in our new obedience
secondly that the question is not of our justification before men but before god
for we acknowledge that we are justified that is declared and knowne to be just not onely by profession of the faith but also by good workes as saint

iames teacheth
thirdly that wee doe not deny that there is a righteousnesse in the faithfull as bellarmine falsly chargeth us
for we professe that there is no faithfull or justified man in whom there is not inherent righteousnesse more or lesse according to the measure of grace received
and further we professe that this righteousnesse which we have from god and is inherent in us is graciously both accepted of him and rewarded by him but wee

deny that any man is justified by it
this question therefore is concerning the matter of justification
for whereas justification considered as an action of god is his making or constituting a man righteous either by christs righteousnesse imputed as wee teach according to the scriptures or by righteousnesse infused as the papists hold it is therefore apparent that as according to our doctrine the righteousnesse of christ is the matter and the imputation thereof the forme of justification so according to their doctrine inherent righteousnesse should be the matter of justification and the infusion of it the forme
but howsoever wee differ in respect of logicall termes in setting downe the state of this controversie because they against reason make inherent righteousnesse the forme of justification yet the true state of the controversie betweene them and us is this whether wee bee justified before god by christs righteousnesse which is out of us in him imputed to us or by that righteousnesse which being infused of god is inherent in us whether it bee the righteousnesse of god as the apostle calleth it that is of christ who is god inherent in him or a righteousnesse from god inherent in us we hold the former the papists the latter


ii
now this is the principall point of difference betweene them and us in this whole controversie and that in two respects first because the righteousnesse of god whereby wee are justified is the principall matter contained or revealed in the gospell rom

for which cause wee who maintaine justification by that righteousnesse of god which is taught in the gospell which the pápists oppugne are worthily called the professours of the gospell whereof the papists are professed enemies
secondly because upon this all the other points of difference doe depend
for if wee were justified by righteousnesse inherent then it would follow
first that to justifie were to make just by infusion of righteousnesse inherent
secondly that wee are justified by the grace of god or rather graces inherent in us
thirdly that the forme of justification were infusion of righteousnesse
fourthly that faith doth justifie as a part of inherent and habituall righteousnesse and therefore also that it doth not justifie alone
fifthly that workes justifie as our actuall righteousnesse
but on the contrary if wee bee justified by that righteousnesse which is not inherent in us but out of us in christ then it followeth first that to justifie doth not signifie making righteous by justice inherent
secondly that we are not justified by inherent grace but by the gracious favour of god accepting us in christ
thirdly that wee are not justified by infusion but by imputation of righteousnesse
fourthly that faith doth not justifie as a part of inherent righteousnesse but as the hand to receive christ who is our righteousnesse
fifthly that workes doe not justifie as causes to worke but as fruits and signes to declare and manifest our justification


iii
and as the proofe of this inferreth the rest so the rest being proved are so many proofes of this
for first if to justifie doe never in the scriptures signifie to make righteous by infusion of righteousnesse then wee are not justified by inherent righteousnesse neither

is justification by inherent righteousnesse that justification which the scriptures teach
secondly if wee bee not justified by grace inherent then not by habituall or inherent righteousnesse if by the gracious favour of god freely without respect of any cause of justification in us then not by workes or inherent righteousnesse
thirdly if by imputàtion of christs righteousnesse then not by infusion of inherent justice
fourthly if by faith as it is the hand to receive christs righteousnesse then not by righteousnesse inherent
fifthly if not by workes as any cause then not by inherent righteousnesse
but the two first have fully and clearely proved already the first in the second booke and the second in the third
and the rest shall by the grace of god demonstrate in their due place


iv
that which hath already beene said both here and

heretofore together with that which shall hereafter bee produced to prove the other three points remaining to bee proved might bee a sufficient demonstration of this point
but because the proofe of this point being the principall doth prove all the rest as have shewed therefore will not onely bring a supply of divers arguments by disproving the popish assertion and proving our owne but also answere the cavills and objections of the papists
and first will prove our assertion and disprove theirs joyntly and together and then severally will disprove their assertion viz that wee are justified by righteousnesse inherent in ourselves and prove ours to wit that wee are justified by the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him

chap
ii
that we are justified by christs righteousnesse and not by that which is inherent in us proved joyntly by three arguments


first therefore that righteousnesse whereby we are justied

is gods righteousnesse and not ours the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him is gods righteousnesse that which is inherent in us is ours

therefore wee are justified by the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him and not by that which is inherent in our selves
the former part of the proposition is proved out of rom

and

thus the righteousnesse which there is said to be revealed in the gospell is that righteousnesse by which wee are justified
this proposition is confessed of all

the righteousnesse of god is that righteousnesse which is revealed in the gospell
rom

in the gospell is revealed the

righteousnesse of god from faith to faith as it is written the just by faith shall live rom

the righteousnesse of god is without the law manifested viz in the gospell even the righteousnesse of god which is by faith of iesus christ unto all and upon all that beleeve

therefore the righteousnesse of god is that righteousnesse by which wee are justified
the whole proposition in both the parts is proved out of rom

where it is not onely signified that wee are justified by gods righteousnesse and not by our owne but there is also such an opposition made betwixt gods righteousnesse and ours in the point of justification that whosoever seeke to be justified by their owne rigteousnesse cannot be justified by the righteousnesse of god
wherefore paul in the question of his owne justification renounceth his owne righteousnesse desiring to bee found in christ not having his owne righteousnesse which is of the law as all inherent righteousnesse is but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousnesse which is of god by faith phil





the assumption in respect of the former part viz that the righteousnesse

of christ is gods righteousnesse is easily proved first because christ is god who as eremy prophecied should be called ebovah our righteousnesse er

now his righteousnesse is called gods righteousnesse as hath beene said· not because it is the righteousnesse of the godhead but because it is the righteousnesse of him that is god
for as the bloud of christ by which we are redeemed is gods bloud act

so the righteousnesse of christ by which we are justified is the righteousnesse of god and is so called cor

rom





and most plainely pet


where it is called the righteousnesse of god

and our saviour iesus christ which is an excellent testimony to prove the deity of our savior like to that ti

for it is not said of god of our saviour as noting two persons

but of god and our saviour as betokening one
secondly because it is that very righteousnesse of god whereof the apostle speaketh in the places even

now mentioned where it is so called neither because it is the essentiall righteousnesse of god as have shewed before against osiander nor because it is a righteousnesse in us from god for that is perfectly described in the law as this is not rom

and because that as shall shew in the proofe of the second part of the assumption is not called gods but ours but because it is the righteousnesse of that person who is god which that wee should not thinke to bee any thing in us is called sometimes his bloud rom

sometimes his obediene

that is both his passive and active righteousnesse by imputation whereof those that truely beleeve

are made the righteousnesse of

god not in themselves but in christ even as hee by imputation of our sinnes was made sinne for us


iii

because divers of the fathers to whose judgment some of

the popish

doctors subscribe by the righteousnesse of god mentioned in the first third and tenth chapters to the romanes understand christ and his righteousnesse
origen in rom
therefore this righteousnesse of god quae est christus which is christ is manifested without the law and so in rom

ambrose in rom

not knowing the justice of god that is as hee expoundeth ignorantes uncesse christum the iewes being ignorant that this is the christ whom god had promised said another was to be expected preferring their owne righteousnes which they had by the law before him who is the righteousnesse of god by faith justitia ipse est for hee himselfe is the righteousnesse which words wee finde also in sedulius in rom

anselmus in

they are not subject justiciae dei id est christo to the righteousnesse of god that is to christ
remigius in ro

ignorantes dei justitiam non quo ipse justus est essentialiter sed christm
they being ignoran of the justice of god not that whereby he is just essentially but would not submit their neckes justitiae dei id est christ to the justice of god that is to christ and in rom

possumus ipsam justitiam dei patris id est filium intelligere we may understand the very righteousnesse of god the father that is to say the sonne from whom and by whom we are ipse christus justitia nostra christ himselfe our righteousnesse hath testimony from the law and the prophets some to the same purpose understand the righteousnesse of faith
theophilact in ro

and oecumenius likewise undefined span alphabet the faith in christ hee calleth the righteousnesse of god
anselmus in roman


the righteousnesse of god is revealed in the gospell that is the righteousnesse of faith which was covered in the law for the righteousnesse of god is that by which hee freely justifieth a sinner through faith without the workes of the law sedulius in rom

the righteousnesse of god because it was just that as abraham beleeving was justified by faith onely so all others imitating his faith should be saved
augustine speaking of those words rom

the righteousnesse of god is manifested hee did not say saith hee

the righteousnesse of man or the righteousnesse of our owne will but the righteousnesse of god not whereby god himselfe is just sed induit hominem but wherewith hee endueth a man which is a metaphore taken from garments when he justifieth a sinner where if augustine had by righteousnesse understood inherent he should have beene confuted out of the very place which saith this righteousnesse is revealed without the law which cannot be verified of inherent righteousnesse
and againe

this is the righteousnesse of god quae testamento veteri velata in revelata which having beene covered in the old testament which cannot be said of righteousnes inherent for all that righteousnes which is from god in us whether it bee habituall consisting in the habit of charity or actuall which is obedience is exactly prescribed in the law which is the perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse is discovered in the new which is therefore called the righteousnesse of god because by imparting it he maketh men righteous


iv
but most agreeable to the words and meaning of the apostle

is the exposition of theodore as it is related by cardinall

tolet and

pererius the iesuite
that by the righteousnesse of god is meant the righteousnesse of christ who is both god and man which he performed for the redemption of mankinde· thereby fully satisfying the justice of god for us
conclude with pererius and cardinall cajetan
the justice of god is a justice satisfactory to god for the sinnes of mankinde by the death adde and obedience of christ
and this is called the justice of god the justice of faith or the justice which is by fath rom

cajetan in rom

the justice of god is a justice of satisfaction to god for mankinde by the death of christ and in cor

the righteousnesse of god in christ is the merit of christ sufficient even to satisfie for us and to justifie is called gods

both because it is the righteousnesse of god personally and also because before the tribunall of god it is true righteousnesse differing from our righteousnesse which before the judgement seate of god are as the cloth of a menstruous woman when therefore the merit of christ is communicated unto us then are we made the righteousnesse of god in christ because wee are made just not by our owne righteousnesse but by the righteousnesse of god communicated unto us in christ for we are made just before god by the merit by the satisfaction by the reconciliation made by christ and againe in rom

the redemption wrought by christ is gods righteousnesse not ours because iesus christ himselfe is true god

this righteousnesse of christ which is called the righteousnesse of god by which we are justified the papists even bellarmine himselfe sometimes confesse to be a plenary satisfaction to god and by him imputed to them that beleeve and that this righteousnesse of christ is the meritorious cause of our justification and that by the merit of christs righteousnesse we are justified and yet they cannot abide to heare that it is the matter of justification when as wee by the matter of justification understand nothing but that righteonsnesse which is imputed to justification
now it is certaine that the righteousnesse of christ neither active nor passive which were transient nor the merit thereof can otherwise be communicated to us but by imputation
even as the actuall transgression of adam and the guilt thereof were by imputation communicated to us
neither could inherent righteousnesse bee merited for us unto our sanctification unlesse his righteousnesse it selfe and the merit thereof were first imputed to us unto justification no more than the actuall sinne of adam could have infected us with originall corruption if his sinne and the guilt thereof had not first beene imputed to us



the fecond part of the assumption was that the righteousnesse

inherent in us is our righteousnesse which one would thinke should need no proofe
for though we receive it from god as wee doe all other good things which wee have yet it as well as all other good things even our daily bread which we have received from god

is to be called

ours
all good things which we have are gods gifts and yet they are not called his but ours
as our bodies our soules our life our liberty our learning our wisedome our charity our temperance our piety and so our righteousnesse
the papists and some others doe teach that that righteousnesse is called gods righteousnesse which wee shall have from god· and that ours which wee have from our selves and by the strength of nature whereto answer first there can bee no righteousnesse which is not the gift of god from

whom all gifts doe come
neither is it credible that the iewes who were instructed in gods word should ever looke to bee justified by a righteousnesse not received from god
the pharisee himselfe who trusted unto his owne righteousnesse and thought as the apostle speaketh of the iewes

to be justified by his owne righteousnesse acknowledged it to be the gift of god and therefore thanked him for it
and hereunto bellarmine

elsewhere accordeth endeavouring by the example of the pharisee who trusted in himselfe as being righteous to prove that men are not justified by speciall faith or by affiance in gods speciall mercie
and lest any should object that hee trusted to a righteousnesse which he had of himselfe hee addeth neither can it bee said that the pharisee had faith or affiance of gods benevolence by reason of his owne merits as though hee eleeved that he had his righteousnesse from himselfe
nam agebat gratias deo de sua justitia proinde deo eam se habere credebat for he gave god thankes for his righteousnesse and therefore beleeved that he had it from god
secondly the righteousnesse of god by which wee are justified is without the law revealed in the gospell but all that righteousnesse which is from god within us is fully and perfectly described in the law


vi thirdly as the severall parts of inherent righteousnesse

though received from god as being his gifts of grace are notwithstanding called ours as our faith matth

psalm

ezech in his


and
chapters foureteene times
matth


and

according to the latine cor

but there are two which are most remarkeable psalm


where david thus calleth upon the lord god of my righteousnesse that is saith bellarmine

quo est omnis me justitia acknowledging all his righteousnesse to bee from god and yet calleth it his owne righteousnes
esa

their righteousnesse is from me saith the lord from god but yet theirs
if it bee objected out of augustine that it is called the righteousnesse of god non qua justus est sed qua nos justos facit not whereby hee is just but whereby hee maketh us just
answer that christs righteousnesse both habituall and actuall

both active and passive is such for it is not that whereby god that is the godhead is just but that whereby hee maketh us just

fourthly whereas the papists will needes have the righteousnesse of god by which wee are justified and which is the principall matter taught in the gospell to be inherent in us though from god they confound gods righ teousnes and ours and thereby confound the law and the gospell and by confounding them abolish the righteousnes of god as before by confounding justification with sanctification they abolished the benefit of justification and evacuate the gospell or at least with the false apostles gal

teach another gospell whiles they teach another righteousnesse whereby to bee justified than the righteousnes of god which whosoever doth though hee were an apostle though an angel from heaven

he ought to be held accursed


vii
our second argument that is the matter of our justification besore god by which wee being sinners in our selves for that justification which the scriptures teach is the justification

of a sinner doe stand righteous before god which wee being sinners may oppose to the judgement of god why he should not condemne us which wee being sinners may interpose betwixt gods justice and us and which we may plead as a full satisfaction to god for us
such is the righteousnes of christ for being sinners in our selves yet beleeving in christ we are in

him accepted and constituted righteous
the righteousnesse of christ is that which we being sinners in our selves may oppose to gods judgement or interpose betwixt gods justice and us which wee may plead as a full satisfaction made in our behalfe
for though by our sins wee have deserved to bee condemned and to be excluded from heaven yet if wee beleeve in christ his sufferings are accepted in our behalfe to free us from hell and his obedience to entitle us unto heaven
in him we have borne the penalty in him wee have fulfilled the

law
such is not ours for being sinners in our selves wee cannot stand before god as righteous by justice inherent neither can wee oppose it to gods judgement or interpose it betwixt gods justice and our sinnes or plead it as a full satis faction
but the best of us must pray with david

enter not into judgement with thy servant lord for no flesh shall bee righteous in thy sight namely if thou enter into judgement with him and againe

if thou lord shalt marke iniquity lord who shall stand but there is forgivenesse with thee that thou mayst be feared
augustine on those words

quis sustinebit non dixit ego non sustinebo sed quis sustinebit vidit propè totam vitam humanam circumlatrari peccatis suis accusari omnes conscientias cogitationibus sis non inveniri cor castum praesumens de sua justitia
si ergo cor castum non potest inveniri quod praesumat de sua justitia praesumat omnium cor de misericordia dei dicat deo si iniquitates observaveris domine domine quis fustinebit quae a.spes est quoniam apud te propitiatio est quae est ista propitiatio nisi sacrificium quod est sacrificium nifi quod pro nobis oblatum est sanguis innocens fusus delevit omnia peccata est apud te propitiatio
nam si non esset apud te propitiatio si judex solum esse

velles misericors esse nolles observares omnes iniquitates nostras quaeeres eas quis staret in judicio tuo spes ergo una est quoniam est apud te propitiatio
againe

augustine and some others doe use to joyne in coherence the
and
verses of the
chapter of

the proverbs when the righteous king shall sit on his throne who can say my heart is cleane wee deny not that there is a righteousnesse inherent in the faithfull that it is accepted of god in christ that it is graciously rewarded but we deny that we are justified thereby
this is not it in which wee can stand in judgement before the righteous king sitting on his throne


viii
our third argument by that righteousnesse of man

which onely is perfect wee are justified and not by that which is unperfect

the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him is the onely righteousnesse of man which is perfect and all our inherent righteousnesse in this life is unperfect
therefore wee are justified by the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him and not by any righteousnesse inherent in our selves

the proposition needeth no proofe for that justice which is not perfect cannot stand in judgement before god and is so farre from justifying that it selfe is sinfull every imperfection and defect being undefined span alphabet a transgression of the law and consequently a sinne
so long saith augustine

as charity may be increased assuredly that which is lesse than it ought to bee is vicious and againe

more plainely peccatum est cum charitas minor est quàm debet it a sinne when charity is lesse than it ought
doe not say that the habit of grace as faith or charity or a worke of grace as prayer or almes giving is a sinne and much lesse a mortall sinne as our adversaries charge us but say that the imperfection or defect of the habit or the worke is a sinne and in respect thereof neither the habit nor the worke though good is purely and perfectly good but sinfull and stained

with the flesh which staine to them who are in christ iesus is veniall and it notwithstanding both the habit and the worke of grace are cum venia with favour and indulgence through the merits and intercession of our saviour in him accepted the want and imperfection being by his perfect righteousnesse and obedience covered
that the righteousnesse of christ is perfect is also manifest and that it is the onely righteousnesse of man which in this life is perfect is evidently proved because all the righteousnesse of all meere and mortall men is unperfect
and that prove by these reasons


ix
first no sinners have perfect righteousnesse inherent in them
all mortall men are sinners
therefore no mortall man hath perfect righteousnesse inherent in him

the proposition is manifest for whiles men bee sinners they cannot

be perfectly righteous
the assumption viz that all men are sinners it is proved by the common experience of all men in all ages
secondly

it is grounded upon most plaine and undeniable testimonies of holy scriptures which have concluded all men whatsoever under sinne
gal


rom

king


eccl

thirdly it is a

confessed and received truth which therefore the apostle in his enthymeme gal


taketh for granted
for thus the apostle argueth

every one that is a transgressour of the law is accursed therefore all men whatsoever even those who seeke by their obedience of the law to be justified are accursed
if any man should deny the consequence of this enthymeme it is to bee made good by adding the assumption which the apostle left out as a thing presupposed and taken for granted thus

whosoever is a transgressour of the law is by the law accursed which the apostle expresseth in these termes

cursed is every one that continueth not in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them

but all men without exception even those which seeke to be justified by the law are transgressours of the law never any man continued in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them that is never any meere and morall man hath so abstained from all evill forbidden as that he hath also done the things commanded that he hath done all that hee hath ever continued in doing all
thus chrysostome understandeth the apostle to argue
no man is justified by the law undefined span alphabet for all have sinned and are under the curse and saith that the apostle by testimony proveth undefined span alphabet that no man hath fulfilled the law and oecumenius likewise in gal

that the apostle proveth that even those who seeke to be justified by the law are under the curse why undefined span alphabet because no man saith he fulfilleth the law

therefore all men without exception even those which seeke to bee justified by the law are by the law accursed which conclusion is of no force if it bee not granted that all men are transgressours

of the law
fourthly all they who are to pray to god for the forgivenesse of their sinnes are sinners but all even the best of men are to pray to god for the forgivenesse of their sinnes

pro hac that is for remission of sinnes or abit ad te omnis sanctus every godly man shall pray unto thee
our saviour taught his owne apostles and all other christians to pray daily for remission of sinne
every one saith cyprian

is taught peccare se quotidie dum quotidie per peccatis jubetur orare that he sinneth daily seeing he is commanded to pray daily for his sinnes
therefore all even the best of us are sinners fifthly whosoever

doth that evill which he would not and doth not that good which hee would is a sinner both in respect of commission and omission but such is the condition of the best even of the apostl himselfe rom



for so he saith vers undefined span alphabet my selfe

sixthly whosoever hath sinne is a sinner all men have sinne and that prove thus whosoever is a lyar himselfe and maketh god a lyar that saith he hath no sinne he undoubtedly is a sinner
but every man though he were as holy as the beloved apostle and evangelist saint iohn is a lyar himselfe and maketh god a lyar that saith he hath no sinne for if wee saith he including himselfe say we have no sinne wee deceive our selves and the truth is not in us iohn

if we say that we have not sinned we make him a lyar and his word is not in us vers
therefore every man though hee be as holy as saint iohn himselfe is a sinner
seventhly whosoever is free from sinne is also free from death no mortall man is free from death therefore no mortall man is free from sinne

chap
iii
the question concerning the imperfection of inherent righteousnesse further discussed


to contradict this argument that we are not justified

by righteousnesse inherent because it is unperfect bellarmine indeavoureth to prove that it is perfect both in respect of habituall and actuall righteousnesse
but in both hee useth to dispute

sophistically in the first because some men have beene indued with perfect righteousnesse in the second because some good works of the just are purely and perfectly good
for though both these assertions were true as they are not yet would they not conclude justification by inherent righteousnesse
for first as touching the persons the question is not whether some choice men in some part of their life after they have beene good and long proficients doe attaine to some perfection but whether they and all others when they are first justified are endued with perfect justice for if they be not then endued with perfect inherent righteousnesse they are not justified by it
now justification by habituall righteousnesse which they call their first justification is incipientium of incipients and themselves distinguish christians into three rankes that some are incipients some proficients some perfect
but incipients are such as be infants and babes either in respect of age when being baptized in their infancie are as they teach justified or in respect of religion being new converts
but to imagine that either infants

which have not so much as the use of reason nor are as yet capable of the habits of faith hope and charity and much lesse are able to produce the acts to beleeve to hope to love or new converts who are like babes to bee fed

with milke are indued with perfect righteousnesse is a great absurdity


ii
yea but saith

bellarmine the workes of god are perfect deut

habituall righteousnesse is the worke of god therefore it is perfect
answ
the workes of god are either immediate and such as

hee worketh at once or else mediate which hee worketh by degrees
the former are perfect at the first according to their kinde as were the workes of creation
the latter are not perfect at the first but by degrees are brought to perfection as the worke of procreation or carnall generation and of spirituall or regeneration
adam was the immediate worke of god created at once and therefore perfect in his kinde at the first
seth also was the worke of god not immediate by creation but mediate by procreation being first begotten by his parents and conceived then formed in the wombe then borne then growing from age to age untill hee came to bee a perfect man
so it is in the spirituall
for wee are the workemanship of god created

unto good workes but we are not perfect christians at the first
for we are first begotten by the incorruptible

seed of gods word receiving as it were the seeds of gods graces at the first being but as embryons in the wombe untill christ

bee formed in us
and when wee are borne a new wee are at the first but as new borne babes who are to desire the sincere

milke of the worke that we may grow thereby and afterwards stronger meats that wee may grow more and more and then not contenting our selves with that measure of growth which wee have attained unto must still strive towards perfection being from day

to day renewed in the inner man untill we come to be adult growne men or as the apostle speaketh

perfecti and when we are such because alwayes in this life we are in our undefined span alphabet or growing age receiving onely the first

fruits of the spirit wee must imitate the apostle paul who though he farre excelled the most perfect among us acknowledged that he had not attained

to perfection but did strive towards it exhorting all others who are perfect that is adulti or growne men to be of his minde that is that they should acknowledging their imperfection still more and more strive towards perfection


iii
as touching actuall righteousnesse hee dealeth also sophistically

for first where hee should prove that the works of the faithfull are perfect or purely and absolutely good he proveth that they are truely good and not sinnes but especially when he should prove that all the workes of the faithfull or righteous are purely and perfectly good he proveth that some are
as though a man who is not onely guilty of many sinnes and infected with manifold corruptions and infirmities but also in respect of his former sinnes obnoxious to damnation could bee justified by some good workes among many not

good
but this is a most erroneous conceit of the papists who hold that every good worke proceeding from charity doth absolutely deserve heaven even as well as any evill worke committed against charity deserveth hell
as though by one act of charity the whole law were fulfilled as well as by one act committed against charity the whole law is broken
hee that transgresseth one commandement

though it bee but once is guilty of all
but hee doth not fulfill the law and much lesse can bee justified by his obedience whose obedience is not totall

perfect and perpetuall
it is true that a faithfull man may bee justified that is declared and approved to be just by some one or more good workes as abraham

by offering his sonne isaac and rahab by her entertaining and delivering of the espies but no man can bee justified before god by his works who is guilty of any sinne
for if paul

who was not conscious to himselfe of any sinne was not thereby justified how can he that is guilty of any or rather many sinnes be justified for whosoever is justified before god

is blessed but cursed

is every one that continueth not in all the things which are written in the booke of the law· to doe them


iv
but if it shall evidently appeare that none of the workes of the faithfull are purely and perfectly good how farre then are the papists from proving justification by workes
and this will prove by divers arguments which will also maintaine against the cavils of the papists
and first out of esa

we are all as an uncleane person or thing all our righteousnesses are as a menstruous cloth
where the church doth freely confesse her selfe and all her members to bee uncleane and all their righteousnesses that is all their most righteous workes to bee as polluted clouts which though it be a most pregnant testimony wherein wee have just cause to triumph yet bellarmine

saith it is impertinent and that for three reasons first because without doubt the prophet speaketh not of just men but of notorious sinners for whose sinnes the city of ierusalem and people of the iewes was to be delivered into the hands of the king of babylon
and that the prophet speaketh in the person of such wicked men he endeavoureth also to prove by three arguments first because he a little before had said because thou art angry and wee have sinned that is as cyrill expoundeth it because thou art angry thou hast forsaken us
but neither is god angry with the just neither doth hee forsake them
answere no lesse confidently but upon better grounds that without doubt the prophet speaketh in the person of the church and namely of the faithfull who living after the desolation of ierusalem in the captivity of babylon should bewaile their owne sinnes and of the whole people of the iewes which had drawne upon them those fearefull judgements
for these words are part of that prayer of the church of the iewes which from the seventh verse of the
chapter is continued to the end of the
and in token of this continuation the latter part of the last verse of the former chapter in the hebrew is the beginning of this chapter in the greeke latine and other translations
now in the former chapter the same persons which here confesse their

sinnes after they had magnified gods mercies towards them verse
doe say unto god verse
doubtlesse thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of us and israel know us not thou lord art our father and our redeemer
and in this chapter as they bewaile in this verse their sinnefulnesse with aggravation so they desire the lord whom they call their father not to remember their iniquities because they are his people verse

professing their hope of salvation verse
which is not the manner of notorious and impenitent sinners but of those that are penitent and faithfull
and further that which esay here foretelleth is accordingly performed first by daniel chap
from the fourth verse to the twentieth who in like manner in the name and behalfe of the desolate church of the iewes prayeth unto god confessing his owne sinnes and of the people of israel as he speaketh verse
secondly by the church in captivity which send the like prayer written by baruch to the priest and people who then were at ierusalem
baruch
from the
verse of the first chapter to the end of the third



this then is the confession of the church which according

to tertullians rule is to bee extended· unto the faithfull in all times and so it is understood by origen

who saith that no man may glory of his owne righteousnesse seeing here it is said that all our righteousnesse is as the cloth of a menstruous woman by hierome

wee shall bee saved onely by thy mercie who of our selves are uncleane
and what righteousnesse soever wee seeme to have is compared to a cloth of a menstruous woman
by augustine

all our righteousnesse compared with divine justice is accounted like the cloth of a menstruous woman as the prophet esay saith and again

whatsoever an uncleane person toucheth shall bee uncleane but all wee are as the cloth of a menstruous woman comming from a corrupt masse and uncleane we beare in our foreheads the spot of our uncleannesse which wee cannot conceale at least from thee who seest all things
by bernard in divers places first for

our humble righteousnesse if wee have any is perhaps right but not pure unlesse peradventure wee beleeve our selves to be better than our forefathers who no lesse truely than humbly said all our righteousnesse is like the cloth of a menstruous woman for how can there be pure justice where as yet fault cannot bee wanting
and againe

what can all our righteousnesse bee before god shall it not according to the prophet be reputed as the cloth of a menstruous woman and all our righteousnesse if it bee straitly judged will it not be found unjust and defective what then will become of our sinnes seeing our righteousnesse cannot answere for it selfe wherefore crying earnestly with the prophet enter not into judgement with thy servant lord let us in all humility have recourse to mercie which alone can save our soules
thirdly

if shall bee just will not lift up my head for all my righteousnesses before him are as the cloth of a menstruous woman
fourthly

it is perfect and secure glorying when wee feare all our workes as blessed iob testifieth of himselfe and when wee acknowledge with the prophet esay that all our righteousnesses are to bee reputed no other than

the cloth of a menstruous woman
fifthly

surely if all our righteousnesses being viewed at the light of truth shall bee found like a menstruous cloth what then shall our unrighteousnesses bee found to bee and to the like purpose might alleage dionys

vi
but let us briefly examine bellarmines proofes where to

omit cyrill who understandeth the place contrary to bellarmines conceipt of the wicked iewes who after they had crucified christ persisted in their infidelity his first reason is from the words going before

because god is not angry with the just nor forsaketh them but according to our doctrine forsooth hee covereth their sinnes and imputeth them not
answere first that when the children of god do sinne god is angry as the prophet here saith behold when wee sinne thou art angry
god was angry with moses exod

secondly that by their sinnes

they provoke gods judgements the fruits of his anger from which they are so farre from being exempted that judgement beginneth

at the house of god
thirdly that if they meet

not the lord in his judgments and doe not judge themselves then are they sure to be judged of the lord· for though he doth not hate them nor execute upon them the fruits of his eternall anger yet he is angry with his children when they sin for to sin against him is to offend him and for their sins he doth many times judge and correct them but our comfort is when we are judged we are chastized

of the lord that wee should not be condemned with the world
fourthly that they are patiently to beare the anger of god because they have deserved it lam

and as touching gods forsaking of his children whereof notwithstanding there is no mention in this place it is certaine that although he doth never utterly or finally forsake his children psalm

for a small moment have forsaken thee but in great mercies will gather thee
in a little wrath hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindenesse will have mercie on thee saith the lord thy redeemer


vii
his second proofe is from the words following vers

and there is none that calleth upon thy name nor standeth up to take hold of thee
but the just doe call upon god therefore the prophet doth not speake in the person of the just
answ
ordinarily the godly doe give themselves to prayer though sometimes when they are left unto themselves they doe neglect it
but as ordinarily they doe not neglect this duty so when they have neglected it their manner is as in this place

to complaine of the neglect thereof
for according to this prophecie daniel and the remnant of iuda which were in captivity in whom it was fulfilled use the very same complaint in their prayer dan


baruch



viii
his third proofe is out of the words themselves where

the righteousnesse of them that make this prayer is compared to a menstruous cloth and therefore saith he he speaketh not in the person of the just whose good works in the scriptures are highly commended
ans
it is not likely that the hypocrits who use to trust in their owne righteousnesse and to boast of it would complaine of the defectivenesse therof
but howsoever the godly though weak indevors of the faithfull are graciously accepted of god in christ and freely rewarded yet the children of god when they are humbled under the hand of god or doe summon and present themselves before the judgement seat of the lord or in their soules doe exercise judgement according to the testimony of their owne conscience they doe use to judge and condemne themselves and to speake as basely of themselves and of their works as the faithfull doe in this place wee are as an uncleane person that is as a leper who according to the law was to cry out am uncleane am uncleane levit


and all our best actions are stained with the flesh like a polluted cloth or as dan cap

and the remnant of iuda baruch

in whom this prophecie was fulfilled who speake most basely of themselves and of their actions
yea the more godly a man is the more sensible he is of his corruption and the more ready with aggravation to confesse it
quanto saith gregory

ad deum veriùs per bona opera surgimus tanto subtiliùs vitae nostrae sordes agnoscimus by how much more truly wee arise to god by good works by so much the more exquisitely wee acknowledge the pollutions of our life and againe

with how great cleanenesse soever holy men doe shine notwithstanding by reason of this body wherein they are which is corrupted they judge themselves abominable and by reason of the filth of concupiscences without which they are not they repute themselves uncleane and to the like purpose cardinall

cont
godly men saith he by how much the more they profit in godlinesse by so much the lesse they please themselves especially when they are summoned or doe summon themselves

to appeare before god as every one ought to doe who would be justified either before god or in the court of his owne conscience
iob the most holy and righteous in his time when hee stood before god abhorred

himselfe repenting in dust and ashes
the holy prophet esaias when in a vision hee beheld god sitting on a throne attended by the seraphin proclaiming holy

holy holy the lord god of hosts exclaimeth woe is me am undone for am a man of polluted lips and dwell in the midst of a people of uncleane lippes esa

the faithfull are

undefined span alphabet beggars in spirit who acknowledging that there is nothing in them whereby they might hope to bee justified or saved as beggars rely wholly upon the mercies of god and merits of christ renouncing their own merits and in the question of justification deresting them as polluted clouts as dung

as losse and acknowledging themselves in themselves to be wretched sinners for as herome

saith tunc ergo iusti sumus quando nos peccatores fatemur then are wee just when wee confesse our selves to be sinners
but the pharisaicall papist if he be once justified as by their doctrine all are for a time at the least who either are baptized or absolved hee must thinke that in him there is no sinne nothing that god can justly hate
and therefore farre bee it from him to make such a confession as this or to cry out with the apostle wretched man that am who shal deliver me from this body of death rom



ix
his second reason to prove this allegation to bee imperitnent

is this because although esay should speake of all that is of that whole people yet hee doth not speake of all at all times but onely of the people of the iewes at that time who for their extreme wickednesse were delivered into captivity as appeareth by the words following verse
zion is a wildernesse ierusalem a desolation the temple burnt answ
these words doe prove that the prophet in this place doth not speake in the person of the wicked iewes that lived in his time before the desolation of ierusalem but of the remnant of the faithfull and penitent iewes who being in captivity bewaile their sinnes and lament the desolation of the temple and city
and therefore what is said of them may be extended to the faithfull in all times being as these were humbled before god for their sinnes as penitent suppliants



his third reason because the prophet speaking onely of the wicked

of that time meaneth not all their workes as though all were sinnes for then bellarmine must confesse that the best workes of the unregenerate are but splendida peccata but such as they accounted to bee their righteousnesse as their sacrifice and and other ceremoniall observatious wherein they placed their righteousnesse which because they were not with a good intention nor as they ought are worthily compared but not by them to a menstruous cloth and are rejected by god esa

answ
here bellarmine taketh for granted that the prophet speaketh of the workes of the wicked onely of that time which have disproved
or if hee had spoken of the wicked it were more probable either that they should place their righteousnesse in morall workes if they had any rather than in

ceremoniall or if they placed the top of their righteousnesse as hypocrites many times doe in ceremoniall observations that they would compare those things which they so highly esteemed to menstruous clouts
but hee speaketh of all the persons all wee and therefore including the righteous if there were any at all among them as some there were both before the captivity and in it and of all their righteousnesses and therefore not of their ceremonials onely but also of their morals
neither might they performe the chiefe of their ceremonials during their captivity being in a forraine land


xi secondly that the good workes of the faithfull in this life are not purely and perfectly good prove because in all our best actions there is a mixture of evill either by the absence or defect of some good thing which ought to bee therein or by the presence of some fault or corruption which ought not to be in them
and this prove first out of exod


where the high priest who was the figure of christ is appointed to weare on his forehead a plate of pure gold which is also called an holy coronet exod

levit


engraven with this inscription holinesse of the lord and so the
translate it undefined span alphabet of the lord that is of christ who is the

lord our righteousnesse
the end wherefore he was to weare it was that aaron might beare the iniquity of the holy things which the children of israel should hallow in all their holy gifts
and it was alwaies to be on his forehead that they the holy gifts might be accepted before the lord where we are plainly taught that in all our best actions and holy services which wee performe to god there is iniquity which must bee taken away by the holinesse and righteousnesse of christ imputed unto us otherwise they cannot in themselves be accepted of god


xii
secondly out of eccl

there is not a just man upon the

earth that doth good and sinneth not that is who in doing good sinneth not
for if the meaning were onely thus as bellarmine would have it that none are so just but that sometimes they sinne according to that king


those words that doth good were superfluous for there is no just man that doth not good
but his meaning is that there is no just man upon earth who doing good sinneth not that is which doth good so purely and perfectly as that hee doth not sinne therein
for to the perfecting of a good worke many things must concur the want of any whereof is a sinne
the truth of this doth best appeare in the particulars prayer is a good worke and so is the hearing of the word but there is no man doth so pray or so heare the word but that when hee hath done he hath just cause to pray unto god to forgive his defects and defaults both in the one and the other
and in this sense luther did truly hold that justus in omni opere bono peccat that a just man sinneth in every good worke
not that the worke in respect of its kind or per se is a sinne as if wee said that prayer is a sinne but per accidens because in that good worke there happeneth a defect which defect is a sinne not mortall to them who are in christ but veniall
and thus augustine also seemeth to understand this place
for speaking of the imperfection

of charity in this life hee saith

that so long as it may be increased profectò illud quod minus est quàm debet ex vitio est ex quo vitio non est justus in terra qui faciat bonum non peccet assuredly that which is lesse than it ought to be is out of vice by reason of which vice there is not a just man upon earth who doth good and sinneth not by reason of which vice no living man shall bee justified before god and in another place more plainely hee saith

peccatum est cum charitas minor est quàm esse debet it is a sinne when charity is lesse than it ought to bee


xiii
thirdly such as is the tree such is the fruit
the tree is corrupt in part for even in the best there is the old man and the new the flesh and the spirit betwixt

which there is a perpetuall conflict so that wee cannot doe the things wee would and much lesse as we would

but all even our best actions are stained with the flesh which is such a law in us that when wee would doe good evill is present with us


xiv fourthly actions absolutely good may stand in judgement

before god
but our workes cannot stand in judgement
the best of us have need to pray with him who had lesse neede than wee

enter not into judgement with thy servant lord
if

thou lord shouldest marke what is amisse even in our best actions who should be able to stand noliergo intrare mecum in judicium domine deus meus wherefore enter not into judgement with me lord my god

quantumlibet rectus mihi videar producis tu de the sauro tuoregulam coaptas me adeam pravas invenior
for though seeme to my self never so right thou bringest forth of thy treasury a rule thou examinest mee by it and am found wicked
this which david and augustine expounding him speake in respect of the person may bee applyed to his best actions as namely to his prayer unto which more specially david in both places doth seeme to have relation
lord heare my prayer and enter not into judgement with thy servant
lord heare my voice if thou shouldest marke what is amisse who should stand for though my prayer may the best of us say seeme to my selfe never so godly yet thou hast a rule according to which if thou shouldest exactly examine my prayer it would bee found sinnefull
alas lord doe not pray with that humility in respect of mine unworthinesse nor with that feeling of my want nor with that reverence of thy great and glorious majesty nor with that attention of minde nor with that devotion and fervencie of spirit nor with that assurance of faith that ought to doe
therefore come unto thee not in any conceit of mine owne righteousnesse or of the worthinesse of my prayer but come unto thee in the name and mediation of christ appealing from thy tribunall of justice to the throne of thy grace desiring and beleeving that the incense of my prayers being perfumed with the odours of his merits may and shall bee acceptable unto thee


xv
but if any popish pharisee doth thinke that hee needeth not

thus to pray shall desire his conscience thus to speake unto him doest thou thinke that for the worthinesse of thy prayer thou shalt bee heard and that if the lord should enter into judgement with thee according

to his exact rule he could finde no fault with thy prayer alas besides those blemishes and imperfections even now mentioned whereof the most godly have just cause to complaine thou directest thy prayer not to god alone but to saints and angels and so committest horrible idolatry and when thou dost direct thy prayer unto god thou dost conceive of him under some bodily shape whereby thou doest circumscribe him and make him finite and so no god but an idoll of thine owne braine
thou doest not come unto god in the name and mediation of christ alone who is the onely mediatour betwixt god and man but in the mediation of many others by whose merits and intercession thou hopest and desirest to be heard
thou cravest not the helpe of the holy ghost the spirit of grace and supplication whose helpe thou findest not thy selfe to need for such a prayer as thou doest make
thy prayer is but a formall recitall of a certaine taske of words uttered for the most part without understanding without feeling without devotion without faith
thou if unlearned as the most are thou prayest in an unknowne language speaking like a parrat thou knowest not what thy prayer is a meere thou hopest by the multitude

of thy words and the often repetitions of thy thy and thy creeds most ridiculously and odiously reiterated upon thy beads by most superstitious

battology
and notwithstanding all this wilt thou bee so wickedly impudent as to obtrude thy orisons unto god not only as an acceptable service wherewith though he should enter into judgement with thee he could finde no fault but also impetratory of thy desires satisfactory for thy sinnes and meritorious of eternall life nay assure thee that thy prayer to god with the opinion of satisfaction and merit though it were otherwise well qualified as it is farre from it there being nothing almost performed in it which is required in prayer it were abominable in the sight of god what shall say more the acceptable and effectuall prayer is the prayer of faith iam

whereby a man doth specially beleeve

that his requests are or shall bee granted to him as namely for remission of sinnes and eternall life but thou speake to the best and most learned of the papists thou say dost scorne and detest this speciall faith and so thy prayer wanting faith besides all other the abominations thereof is turned into sinne


xvi
so in like manner in respect of the rest of our actions though seeming laudable unto us wee must pray that the lord will not enter into judgement with us
to which purpose manifold testimonies

of the fathers might be alleaged
these few may serve

hilarie what living man can bee justified in the sight of god in whom there is a mixture of anger of sorrow of concupiscence of ignorance of forgetfulnesse of casualty of necessity happening either through the nature of the body or the motion of the soule alwaies wavering

ambrose

hee that thinketh hee hath gold hath lead and hee who thinketh himselfe to have the graine of wheat hath chaffe which may bee burnt

augustine

woe to the very laudable life of men if mercie being removed thou dost examine it
gregory in many places of his morals lib

quia spe ipsa justitia nostra ad examen divinae justitiae deducta injustitia est sordet in districtione judicis quod inestimatione sulget operantis lib
cap

ipsa nostra perfectio culpâ non caret nisi hanc severus judex in subtili lance examinis misericorditer penset lib
cap

sancti viri omne meritum vitium est si ab aeterno arbitri districtè judicetur lib
cap

omne virtutis nostrae meritum esse vitium lib

si remota pietate discutitur in illo examine etiam justorum vita succumbit cap

on those words of iob si habuero quippiam justum non respondebo he saith ut enim sape diximus omnis humana justitia injustitia esse convincitur si districtè judicetur prece ergo post justitiam indiget ut quae succumbere discussa poterat ex sola judicis pietate convalescat lib
cap

si remota pietate discutimur opus nostrum poen dignum est quod remunerari praemiis prestolamur cap
quousque poena corruptionis astringimur quamlibet rectis operibus insudemus veram munditiem nequaquem apprehendimus sed mur lib
cap

sciunt sancti quia omnis humana justitia injustitia est si divinitùs districtè and in the conclusion of his worke lib
cap

wherein as hee professeth that hee sought chiefly to please god so hee confesseth that this intention was accompanied with other worse intentions and sinister respects as seeking to please men and affecting their praise whereupon hee inferreth si autem de his divinitùs districtè discutimur quis inter ista remanet salutis locus quando mala nostra pura mala sunt bona quae nos credis pura bona esse nequaquam possunt the evill things saith he which we have are purely and meerely evill but the good things which we suppose our selves to have are not nor can in any wise be purely good and so said

bernard nostra siqu est humilis justitia recta forsan sed non pura whence it followeth necessarily that none of the workes of the faithfull are pure and consequently that their very best workes are impure

this which hath been said may suffice to a conscience not cauterized neither shall need to say any more in this needlesse argument
for though it should bee granted that some of the works of the faithfull were purely good as they are not yet so long as any of their works are sinfull as in many things we faile

all insomuch that the righteous as bellarmine himselfe doth cite the place doth fall

seven times a day they cannot be justified by their workes but are by the sentence of the law in themselves accursed because they doe not continue in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them and because the breach of any one commandement maketh them guilty of all
conclude against the papists as

epiphius did censure the catharists these men professing themselves pure by this supposition make themselves unpure for whosoever pronounceth himselfe to be pure therein he doth utterly condemne himselfe to be impure

cap iv
bellarmines arguments answered



this was our third argument taken from the imperfection

of our obedience and righteousnesse which have defended against bellarmines cavils before proceed to the fourth hold it needfull to answere his arguments in propounding whereof hee falleth short of his projects as noted before for hee that would prove that men are justified by their workes had need to prove that all the workes of all the faithfull are purely and perfectly good which is impossible to bee proved but hee neither concludeth of all works nor of all the faithfull
and yet it is most certaine that if the faithfull be justified by their works then all the works of all the faithfull are purely and perfectly good
his proofes are of three sorts authority of scriptures testimonies of fathers and other reasons
out of the scripture he citeth eight testimonies

the first out of iob

in all these things iob sinned not with his lips and that we may not answere with some

of the rabbins that though he sinned not with his lips yet hee might sinne in his heart hee telleth us that in the next chapter

god giveth him this testimonie that still he retained his innocency and therefore sinned neither in his tongue nor in his heart
againe whereas satan sought by so many temptations to bring iob to sinne and god on the other side permitted all those temptations that the patience and vertue of that holy man should bee manifested if iob should have sinned god should after a sort have beene over come by the devill wherfore it is certaine that that worke of iobs patience was not stained with any sinne and that the lutherans which say the contrary take part with the devill against god


ii
answ
those temptations were permitted by god as tyrals

of iob not perfection but integrity
for that is gods end that they who are undefined span alphabet sound and upright may be knowne cor

and this end was atchieved cap

vers
for still iob retained his integrity
but satans intention was to prove him to be an hypocrite and to move him not onely to fall but to fall away from god and to blaspheme him to his face and so much hee undertooke both cap


and cap


howbeit hee failed in his enterprize
and so much is signified in both the places alleaged by bellarmine that iob was so farre either from blaspheming god to his face which satan undertooke he should that he offended not with his lippes nor charged god foolishly or from being discovered to be an hypocrite that by gods owne testimony he

retained his integrity as that word signifieth which

bellarmine according to the vulgar latine calleth innocencie
but iob though hee were upright and sincere yet he was not perfect nor without sinne as appeareth by his manifold imperfections which afterwards he discovered cap

and also by his free confession of his sinfulnesse cap



and lastly by his feare and jelousie which hee had over his best actions lest he had sinned in them for as

gregory writing on those words of iob verebar omnia opera mea

understandeth it to be an humble confession as if he had said quae apertè egerim video sed quid in his latenter pertulerim ignoro what overtly performed see but what covertly suffered therein know not
but here may be objected which bellarmine in the next chapter alleageth out of the said

gregory bonarum mentium est ibi etiam aliquo modo culpam agnoscere ubi culpa non est it is the property of good minds even there to acknowledge a fault where nofault is wherto answere that gregory speaketh in regard of humane infirmities which were laid upon man after his fall and namely of the monthly infirmity of women which though they bee not inflicted upon a man for his personall offences yet it is the property of good minds to esteeme them as laid upon them for their sinnes
thus iob though his afflictions were not inflicted upon him as corrections for his sinnes but as tryals of his vertue yet he imputeth them to his sinnes iob



iii
in the second place he allegeth diverse testimonies out of the

psalmes wherein david pleadeth his owne innocencie and appealeth unto god to be judged according to his owne righteousnesse psalm












answ
in some of these places david pleadeth the justice of his particular cause against his adversaries not the absolute innocencie of his person
the rest are to be understood of his uprighttnesse and integrity
for otherwise no man was more forward to confesse and to deplore his manifold sinnes than david was none more ready to implore gods mercy none more fearefull that god should enter into strict judgement with him


iv
his third testimony is matth


if thine eye be single the whole body shall bee lightsome where bellarmine without any

probability by the body understandeth a good worke and by the single eye a right intention for who knoweth not that many times workes are done with good intentions that are not good
this place in matthew is diversly expounded and may bee applied to many purposes
but the proper true meaning may be gathered out of the coherence as have shewed elsewhere

for in the latter part of that chapter our saviour sheweth both what in our judgements wee should esteeme out chiefe good vers
and consequently what in our afflictions and endeavours wee should chiefly desire and labour for vers

as touching the former he exhorteth us not to lay up our treasure upon earth but in heaven that is that we should place our happinesse not in earthly but in heavenly things
for where our treasure is there will our heart bee also
that is whatsoever wee esteeme our chiese good

upon that our hearts and affections will be set
this judgement concerning our chiefe good is by our saviour compared to the eye whereunto whether it be right or wrong the whole corps or course of our conversation which he compareth to the body will be sutable
if we repose our happinesse in heaven our conversation will bee religious and heavenly but if we place our paradise on earth our conversation will be answerable
as for example if pleasure be our chiefe good our conversation will be voluptuous if profit it will bee covetous if honour it will be ambitious
such therefore as our judgement is concerning happinesse such will be our desires our endeavours and in a word such will bee our whole conversation
but as his allegation is to no purpose so his conclusion is besides the question as if wee held that good workes were in their owne nature mortall sinnes when notwithstanding wee acknowledge them to be good per se and in their kinde as namely prayer and but sinfull by accident as being stained with the flsh



his fourth testimony is cor

if any man build upon

this foundation gold silver stones of price where he supposeth by gold and silver good workes are understood answ
if they were they might be good and yet not purely good
even as a wedge of gold or of silver is truely called gold or silver though there bee some drosse therein
but the apostle speaketh not of workes but of doctrines for he comparing himselfe and other preachers of the gospell to builders saith that he as a had laid the foundation whereon others did build either sound and profitable doctrines which he compareth to gold and silver or unsound and unprofitable compared to hay and stubble


vi
his fifth testimony is iam

in many things we offend

all why pray saith he doth he not say in all things wee offend all for if all the works of the righteous be sinnes then not onely in many things but in all we offend
but saint iames knew what to say for in the second chapter hee had distinguished good workes from sinnes
if you performe the royall law according to the scriptures thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe you doe well but if you accept persons you commit sinne and are reproved of the law as transgressours
answ
the advise of saint iames in this place is that wee should not bee many masters that is censurers of our brethren knowing that by censuring and judging of others wee shall receive the greater judgement according to matth


rom

for he that will take upon him to censure other mens offences had need to be free from offence
but we saith saints iames undefined span alphabet that is undefined span alphabet we all of us offend many wayes we are subject to manifold sinnes and corruptions
for the apostle doth not speake of the singular individuall acts but of the divers sorts of sinne
as sinnes against god our neighbour or our selves sinnes of omission and commission sinnes in deed in thought and in word which last kinde being the fault of censurers is as hee noteth in the next words most hard to bee refrained when as the apostle therefore speaking of all and including

himselfe though hee were worthily called iames the just saith that many wayes wee offend all hee signifieth that even the best of us are subject to manifold corruptions causing us many wayes to offend according the severall kinds thereof which is a manifest evidence that wee being sinners cannot bee justified by inherent righteousnesse especially if that bee added that as wee sinne many wayes according to the severall kinds of sinne so in our good workes which are good in their kind as in prayer almes giving wee offend by reason of the flesh which polluteth all our best actions
but howsoever wee say that our righteousnesses are stained with the flesh yet wee distinguish them from our unrighteousnesses and with saint iames we distinguish good workes from sinnes things commanded from things forbidden things according to their kind good but by accident sinnefull from things which according to their kind are absolutely evill


vii
his sixth testimony is from those places which exhort us not to

sinne as psalm


esa

iohn

pet


iohn

for to what purpose serve these exhortations or admonitions if in every good worke wee cannot but sinne

answ
these exhortations doe not shew what wee are able to doe but what wee ought to doe
neither are they to no purpose,· for first they restraine men and especially the children of god from many particular sinnes
secondly though they exhort us to those things which in this corrupt estate wee are not able perfectly to performe as generally to abstaine from all manner of sin and to avoid all imperfectionsand defects which are incident unto our best actions yet they are to very good purpose
for they serve to discover unto us our imperfections and to shew that perfection wherunto we ought to aspire to moveus not to performe our duties perfunctorily but to walke undefined span alphabet

accurately making conscience of all our waies to admonish us not to rely upon our owne righteousnesse which is so unperfect but to bewaile our imperfections and to crave pardon to teach us what need wee have of the imputation of christs righteousnesse and of his intercession for us and lastly to move us with an upright endevour to keepe all gods commandements with our whole heart and to strive towards that perfection which in this life wee cannot attaine unto which if wee doe our labour shall not bee vaine in the lord
for the lord in his children accepteth

of the will

for the deed and of their upright endeavours for perfect performance
so long therefore as we are upright before god our imperfections ought not too much to discourage us knowing that his grace

is sufficient for us and that his strength is made perfect in our weakenesse


viii
his seventh testimony is taken from those places which

teach that the workes of the righteous doe please god mat

sap

act


pet


phil


but nothing can please god but that which is truly good and pure from all vice as calvin himselfe confesseth iust




answ
as god hath made two covenants with men the one of works

the other of grace so himselfe may bee considered either as a severe judge judging according to the law which is the covenant of workes beholding men as they are in themselves or as a mercifull father in christ dealing with us according to the covenant of grace eholding us in his beloved
as he is a iudge judging according to the law no obedience can satisfie or please him but that which is pure and perfect as calvin truely saith
as hee is the father of the faithfull in christ judging according to the covenant of grace he dealeth with us as a loving father with his children malach


psalm


accepting the upright though weake and unperfect· endevours of his children in lieu of perfect performance
hence in the scriptures to be upright or to walke with god is to please god gen
cum heb

and they who are upright are his delight pro


not that either they or their actions are perfect or accepted of god in and for themselves as being pure from sinne but that being covered with the righteousnesse of christ they are accepted

in him and not onely accepted but also graciously rewarded
then belike saith bellarmine the righteousnesse of christ is imputed not onely to the sinners themselves but to their sinnes also making them an acceptable sacrifice to god
answ
wee speake not of the sinnes of the faithfull as hee maliciously cavilleth as if we made no difference betwixt their good workes and their sinnes but of their good workes which though unperfect and stained with the flesh the lord accepteth in christ as truly good not imputing to the faithfull their wants but covering them with the perfect obedience of christ


ix
his eighth testimony is from those places which absolutely call

the workes of the righteous good workes as mat

tim

tit

eph


answ where he saith that the workes of the faithfull are called absolutely good workes there is an ambiguity to bee cleared
for though the scriptures absolutely call the works of the righteous good workes yet they doe not say that they· are absolutely good
all good workes and vertues being considered in the abstract as they are in themselves according to their kinde and as they are prescribed in the word of god are absolutely good but considered as it were in the concrete as they bee in us or performed by us mixed with imperfections and stained with the flesh they are not absolutely purely and perfectly good
prayer in it selfe and it is prescribed in the word of god is a worke absolutely good but as it is performed by us it may bee truely good if performed in truth and with an upright heart but it is not absolutely and purely good by reason of those imperfections which concurre there
with
so faith and love and all other graces considered in the abstract are absolutely good but considered as they bee in us they are truly but not purely and absolutely good by reason of the impersections and defects which alwayes accompany them

but saith bellarmine out of dionysis areopagita that worke is to be called evill in which there is any defect but it is not to be called good unlesse it be entirely and wholly good which is true according to the rigour of the

law from which our saviour christ hath freed the faithfull and in that sence all the good workes of the papists themselves even their prayers in which they so much trust are sins
or if they deny any defect to be in their prayers or other their supposed good works they speake lyes in hypocisie

having cauterized consciences
but here againe let the reader observe the desperate doctrine of the papists who as they account no man justified in whom there is any sinne so they teach all workes to bee absolutely sinnes in which is any defect whereupon the accusation which they falsly lay to our charge will bee verified of them viz that all the best workes of the faithfull are sinnes
for wee deny them to bee sinnes though they have some defects but they affirme them absolutely to bee sinnes if there be any defect in them as undoubtedly there alwayes is as have alrady proved


these were his testimonies of holy scriptures in the next place hee produceth other witnesses viz ambrose hierome augstine gregory and bernard who testifie nothing against our assertion but against the malicious misconceit of the papists who conceive or at least report of us that wee put no difference betwixt good workes and sins
from which wee are so farre that wee willingly subscribe to that conclusion which hee would prove out of the fathers and is the title of his chapter opera bona non esse peccata sed verè bona that good workes are not sinnes but truly good


xi
now follow his reasons which if they served to prove no

more than the same question which againe is propounded to bee proved wee would not gaine say
but his first reason is brought to prove that the good workes of the righteous are no way vitiated corrupted or defiled and consequently that they are not onely truely but also purely

good
for if they were contaminated saith hee that would arise either from our inbred concupiscence or from the defect of love towards god or from the mixture of veniall sinnes concurring with them
but from none of these
for neither is that concupiscence a sinne in the regenerat nor is the want of the love of god a sinne in them nor veniall sinnes such sinnes as are contrary to the law of god or unto charity

thus for the confirmation of one error bellarmin broacheth three more
but if concupiscence bee a sinne if the want of gods love bee a sinne if those which the papists call veniall sinnes bee sinnes indeede then must it bee confessed that the good workes which are stayned with the flesh which proceed from a defective love of god and our brethren that are mixed with divers imperfections and corruptions are notpurely good


xii
as for concupiscence of the flesh which remaineth in the

regenerate it hath possessed and defiled all the parts and faculties of the soule which as they are in the regenerate partly spirit so they are also partly flesh
and these two are opposite one to the other the spirit lusting against the flesh and the flesh lusting against the spirit
so that though will be present with us

that wee cannot doe what we would and much lesse after what manner wee would that is with our whole

soules with our whole mind heart and affections
for what good wee minde or will as wee are spirit the same wee will as wee are flesh
this concupiscence the apostle had not knowne

to bee a sinne had not the law said non concupisces that is thou shalt have none evill concupiscence neither habituall nor actuall
neither is it onely a sinne as the apostle oftentimes doth cal it but also it is the iam
rom

which taking occasion by the law to produce ill concupiscences therein forbidden is convinced not onely to bee a sinne but exceedingly sinnefull rom

but of this have spoken before and proved by the testimony of augustine that concupiscence against which the good spirit lusteth viz in the regenerate for in the unregenerate the spirit is not is both a sinne and the cause of sin and a punishment sinne


xiii
and as touching the second the summe of the law is that we should love god with all our heart and with all our soule but where is any defect of love there god is not loved with all the heart it being legally understood and therefore every defect is an aberration from the law and consequently a sinne
have also proved out of augustine

that it is a fault where love is lesse than it ought to bee from which fault it is that there is not a righteous man upon earth which doth good and sinneth not
for which also though wee

bee never so good proficients wee must of necessity say forgive us our debts
therefore every defect is a debt that is a sinne whereunto wee may adde that of the same augustine
it is a sinne either when there is not charity where it ought to bee or is lesse than it ought to bee whether this may or may not bee avoided by the will


xiv
and as to the third if those which the papists call veniall sinnes bee not contrary to the law then they are not forbidden in the law and without doubt they are not commanded therein
now if neither they bee commanded nor forbidden then they are things indifferent but that is absurd yea but saith hee veniall sinnes hinder not justice and the scripture absolutely calleth some men just and perfect notwithstanding their veniall sinnes
answere they hinder not imputative justice nor evangelicall perfection which is uprightenesse for to them that beleeve and repent they are not imputed
neither can it be denied but that the most upright men have their imperfections infirmities and slippes which though in themselves and according to the law are mortall sinnes for if they should not bee forgiven they would as bellarmine himselfe confesseth exclude men from heaven yet to them that are in christ iesus thy become veniall by the mercie of god through the merits and intercession of christ


xv
his second reason is taken from divers absurdities which

hee conceiveth doe follow upon our assertion when as indeed they follow not upon our doctrine but upon his malicious misconceiving and misreport thereof as if wee held that all even the best workes of the righteous are mortall sinnes
but wee acknowledge that the good workes of men regenerate are truly good and so to bee called notwithstanding

the imperfection thereof
onely wee deny them to be purely good wherin we have the consent of holy scriptures and of the ancient fathers some whereof before alleaged to whom added gregory and bernard
gregory in the conclsion of his moralls saith thus mala nostra

pura mala sunt bona quae nos habere credimus pura bona esse uequaqua possunt our evill things are purely evill and the good things which we

suppose our selves to have can by no meanes bee purely good
bernard our lowly justice if we have any is perhaps true but not pure
vnlesse peradventure wee beleeve our selves to bee better than our who said no lesse truely than humbly all our righteousnesses are as it were the cloth of a menstruous woman wee doe not say that the good workes of the faithfull are sins and much lesse mortall sins for we hold that the sins of the faithful become to them venial
but this we say with salomon

that there is not a righteous man upon earth that doth good and sinneth not which in effect is the same with that assertion of luther iustus in omni opere bono peccat


xvi
now let us examine the absurdities which hee absurdly

upon his owne malitious misconceit objecteth against us
in all which it is supposed that wee call the good workes of the righteous sinnes yea mortall sinnes
the first if all the workes of the faithfull bee sinnes then the worke of faith whereby we are justified and that prayer whereby we begge remission of sinne should be sinnes

answ
the worke of faith and the act of prayer are good but not

purely and perfectly good
neither are we justified by the worthinesse or by the worke of our faith but by the object which it doth receive nor obtaine our desires by the merit of our prayer but by the mediation and intercession of christ our saviour
our faith is such that wee have need alwayes to pray lord increase our faith lord beleeve help mine unbeleefe and our prayer such that when wee have performed it in the best manner we can wee have neede to pray that the wants and imperfections of our prayer may bee forgiven us

the second if all the works of the righteous be sinnes with what face could the apostle say

that knew nothing by himselfe and what boldnesse was that for his good workes that is for his mortall sinnes to expect

a crowne of righteousnesse answ
though the apostle had no doubt sometimes offended after his conversion yet he was not conscious to himselfe in particular of any actuall sinne or crime committed by him for as the psalmist saith

who can understand his errors no man saith basil

is undefined span alphabet free from sinne but god for of those many things wherein we offend the most wee understand not for which cause the apostle saith know nothing by my selfe but in that am not justified undefined span alphabet that is in many things offend and doc not perceive whence also the prophet saith who understandeth his trespasses but though hee was not conscious to himselfe of his slippes and oversights yet hee was not ignorent of his owne

corruptious and infirmities against which when hee had prayed to god hee received this answere

my grace is sufficient for thee and in weakenesse my power is made perfect

neither did the apostle expect the reward for the merit of his works but for the truth and fidelity of god who is just in keeping his promise made to the upright though unperfect indeavers of his servants
and therefore the reward whereby god doth crowne his owne gifts in us is called a crowne of righteousnesse not of ours but of gods righteousnesse as

bernard saith


xviii
the third if all the works of the righteous were mortall sinnes then god himselfe should sinne mortally because it is god that worketh in us when we doe any good works phil

and
answ
if all good workes were absolutely sinnes yea mortall sinnes as they malitiously charge us to hold then indeed god who is the author of them might perhaps bee said though not to sinne and much lesse to sinne mortally for he is not subject to the precept of the law and much lesse to the curse of it yet to be the author of sinne
but wee hold that the good works of the faithfull are truly good though not purely good and that what goodnesse is in them is the worke of god and what impurity is in them it is from the flesh which staineth the workes of grace in us
neither are the defects of the secondary causes to be imputed to the first cause
that which god worketh in us no doubt is good but this good worke hee hath but begun in us as in the place by him quoted philippians

for our in regeneration wee are not wholly renewed and at once for then wee should bee wholy spirit and no flesh
neither doth the leaven of grace season the whole lumpe at once but the inward

man is renewed day by day and what is not yet renued is a remainer of the old man and what is not spirit is flesh
now betweene these two there is a perpetuall conflict

the spirit lusting against the flesh and the flesh lusting against the spirit
so that a man regenerate cannot with full consent of will doe either good or evill there being a reluctation of the spirit against the evill which the flesh affecteth and a re~luctation of the flesh against that good which is willed by the spirit
by reason of this conflict it comes to passe that as the sinnes of the faithfull are sinnes of infirmity more or lesse and not wilfull sinnes committed of meere malice so the good works of the

faithfull are not purely good but stained with the flesh


xix
the
that our assertion is greatly injurious to our redeemer who as the apostle saith gave himselfe for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity might purge unto himselfe an acceptable people zealous of goodworks for neither should he truly have redemed us from any iniquity nor truly cleansed his people nor made them zealous of works truly good but of mortall sinnes namely if all their good works be mortall sinnes which we utterly deny

but answere our saviour christ gave himselfe for us both that he might justifie us by redeeming us from all iniquity and also that hee might sanctifie or as the apostle speaketh that hee might purifie unto himselfe a peculiar people zelous or studious of good works
the iniquity from which he redeemeth us is not onely of those transgressions which are absolutely sinnes but also of those unperfect and defective workes which wee indevour to performe in obedience to god
and

herein as have said the high priest was a notable type of our saviour christ who did weare in the forefront of his miter a plate of gold in which was ingraven this inscription

holinesse of the lord meaning of

iehovah our righteousnesse which he was appointed to weare that he might beare the iniquity of the holy things which the children of israell should hallow in all their holy gifts that notwithstanding the iniquity of them they might be accepted before the lord by imputation of his holinesse who is iehovah our righteousnesse
and the like is to be said of the incense

of the saints upon earth that is of their prayers and all other their good works which have need to bee perfumed with the odours

of christs sacrifice that so being defective in themselves they may be accepted

of god in christ
as for our sanctification it is true that christ gave himselfe to sanctifie us
but this sanctification is but begun and in part in this life and is to be perfected in the life to come
so saith the apostle

ephcs

that christ loved his church and gave himselfe for it that hee might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himselfe viz at the mariage of the lambe a glorious church not having spot or wrinckle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish which last words as have shewed out of augustine are to bee understood not of the church militant on earth but of the church triumphant in heaven
the workes which we are to be studious of are workes not onely truly but also as much as is possible purely good
for though wee cannot in this life attaine to full purity and perfection yet we must aspire towards it affecting and desiring to performe good works in a better manner and measure than wee can indeed attaine unto
howbeit we must say with the

apostle to will is present with me but how to performe that which is good finde not for the good that would doe not but the evill which would not that doe and lest it should bee said that the apostle speaketh all these things in the perof a carnall man he concludeth thus so then undefined span alphabet even my selfe with the minde that is the spirit serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sinne


xx
the fifth if all good workes are mortall sinnes then some mortall

sinnes are good works and then we may conclude thus
all good works are to be done some mortall sinnes are good works therefore some mortall sinnes are to be done
againe no mortall sinne is to bee done all good workes are mortall sinnes therefore no good worke is to bee done
conclusions worthy of the lutherans that some mortall sinnes are to bee done and that no good worke is to be done
answ we deny good workes to bee mortall sinnes though in every good worke the most righteous doe sinne
the worke it selfe is good though the defect or imperfection which goeth with it is evill
the good worke therefore is to bee done the defect we are to strive and to pray against and to crave pardon for it
to which deprecation we are to expect this answeare or the like my

grace is sufficient for thee and in thy weakenesse my power is perfected
againe wee must distinguish betwixt workes which are sinnes absolutely and per

se and those which are onely by accident
for those which are good per se are to be performed as well as we can because commanded knowing that god will accept of our upright though weake indevour


xxi
the sixth and the last who seeth not that these words good workes are mortall sinnes imply a contradiction for they shall be good and not good

answ
we doe not affirme that good workes are mortall sinnes neither doe we deny them to be truly good
onely we deny them to bee purely and perfectly good
and we acknowledge the impurity and imperfection concurring with them to bee a sinne and consequently that the good workes of the faithfull are good per se as being commanded as being the fruits of the spirit and of faith working by love but sinfull per accidens as being stained with the flesh yea but saith bellarmine bonum non existit nisi ex integra causa malum verò ex quolibet vitio that is that is not to bee accounted a good worke whereunto all things doe not concurre which are requisite but that is evill wherein there is any defect therefore if there be any defect or imperfection to bee found in any worke that worke is not to be accounted good but evill
answ that rule of diony sius is true according to the rigour of the law which they call undefined span alphabet from which our saviour hath delivered us but it is not true according to the covenant of grace wherein the lord accepteth the sincere and upright indevours of his children
though defective and unperfect for perfect performance their wants being not imputed unto them but covered with the robe of christs perfect righteousnesse
as therefore their persons though in themselves sinners are in

christ accepted as righteous so their actions though in themselves defective are acceptable

in christ
here therefore wee may justly retort both the accusation it selfe and all these absurdities upon the papists who be necessary consequence are proved to hold that all the workes of the righteous are simply evill and so absolutely to be called sinnes

those works wherein is found any defect or imperfection are not good but absolutely they are to bee called sinnes as the papists teach but in all even the best works of the righteous there is to be found some defect imperfection or blemish as being stained with the flesh
this assumption is plainely taught in the holy scriptures as have proved heretofore therefore all even the best actions of the righteous are absolutely to be called sinnes as the papists teach

here then let all men againe take notice of the popish pharisaisme or pharisaicall hypocrisie of papists with whom no man is just or justified in whom is any sinne no action good but simply evill in which is any defect and yet their persons are just and their actions not onely good but also meritorious and that ex condigno and that ratione operis of eternall life

chap
our fourth argument that the righteousnesse by which wee are justified satisfieth the law so doth christs righteousnesse so doth not that which is inherent in us


now returne to our owne proofes
the fourth

argument therefore to prove joyntly that we are justified by christs righteousnesse and not by ours may be this

by that righteousnesse alone and by no other we are justified by which the law is fully satisfied by the righteousnesse of christ alone the law is fully satisfied and not by any righteousnesse inherent in us or performed by us therefore wee are justified by the righteousnesse of christ alone and not by any righteousnesse inherent in us or performed by us

for the proofe of the proposition three things are to be acknowledged first that whosoever is justified is made just by some righteousnesse for as have shewed heretofore to thinke that a man should be justified without justice is as absurd as to imagine a man to be clothed without apparell secondly that all true righteousnesse is a conformity to the law of god which is the perfect rule of righteousnesse insomuch as what is not conformable to the law is undefined span alphabet that is iniquity and sinne thirdly that there can be no justification without the law be fulfilled either by our selves or by another for us
for our saviour when he came to justifie us and save us protested that hee came not to breake the law but to fulfill it and professeth that not one jot or tittle of the law should passe unfulfilled matth


saint paul likewise avoucheth that by the doctrine of justification by faith the law is not made void but established rom

the proposition therefore is undenyable
the assumption hath two parts the former affirmative that by the righteousnesse of christ the law is fully satisfied the other negative that by any righteousnesse inherent in us or performed by us the law neither is nor can be fully satisfied
for the clearing of the assumption in both the parts wee are to understand that to the full satisfying of the law since the fall of adam two things are required the one in respect of the penalty unto the suffering whereof sinne hath made us debtours the other in respect of the precept

to the doing wherof the law doth bind us
the former to free us from hell and damnation the other to entitle us to heaven and salvation according to the sanction of the law if thou dost not that which is commanded thou art accursed if thoudoest it thou shalt be saved
in respect of the former the law cannot be satisfied in the behalf of him who hath oncetransgressed it but by eternal punishment or that which is equivalent in respect of the latter it is not satisfied but by a totall perfect and perpetuall obedience


ii
now our saviour christ hath fully satisfied the law for all

them that truly beleeve in him in both respects
for hee hath superabundantly satisfied the penalty of the law for us by his sufferings and by his death and he hath perfectly fulfilled the law for us by performing all righteousnesse in obeying his father in all things even unto death and by them both he hath justified us freeing us from hell by his sufferings and entituling of us unto heaven by his obedience
and therefore the holy ghost affirmeth that wee are justified by his bloud rom

and by his obedience verse
for his sufferings were the sufferings of god in which respect they who put him to death are said to have killed the author of life act


and to have crucified the lord of glory cor
and for the same cause the bloud by which we are redeemed is called the bloud of god act


or which is all one the bloud of the sonne of god
iohn
his obedience likewise was the obedience of god
for iesus christ the word that is the

second person in trinity being in the forme of god

god coequall with his father for our sakes became flesh

that is abased himselfe to become man which before hee was not but not ceasing to bee that which hee was before namely the true

and the great

god god

above all blessed for evermore in our nature being perfect god and perfect man hee farther humbled himselfe and became obedient untill death even to the death of the crose
and therefore the righteousnesse of christ both habituall inherent in his person and that which was performed by him both active and passive being the righteousnesse of god as it is often called rom cap



the righteousnesse of god and our saviour pet


who was given to us of god to be our righteousnesse cor

that wee beleeving in him might bee the righteousnesse of god in him cor
is therefore called iehovah our righteousuesse ier

say his passive righteousnesse being the righteousnesse of god the bloud of god· it is a price of infinite valew and superabundantly sufficient to satisfie for the sinnes not onely of the faithfull but of all the world and not onely of this one world but of more if there were more and this habituall and actuall righteousnesse being the righteousnesse and obedience of god is of infinite and merit to entitle all those that beleeve in him were they never so many to the kingdome of heaven
these things if the papists should deny it would deny them to be christians
the former part therefore of the assumption is of undoubted truth


iii
come wee then to the other part
is there any righteousnesse

inherent in us or performed by us that can fully satisfie the

law nothing lesse
for first in respect of the penalty which is due unto us for our sinnes wee cannot possibly fatisfie it but by enduring everlasting torment which though wee should endure for a million of millions of yeares yet wee could not bee said to have satisfied the law which cannot be satisfied but by endlesse punishment or that which is equivalent but there is nothing equivalent but the precious death and sufferings of the eternall son of god who gave himself to be undefined span alphabet

a full price of ransome countervailing in respect of the dignity of his person the eternall pains of hel which all the elect should have suffered
therefore there is no possibility for us to escape hell the just guerdon of our sinnes unlesse the lord impute our sis to our saviour christ and his sufferings to us accepting them in our behalfe as if we had sustained them in our owne persons
for although wee should for the time to come performe a totall and perfect obedience to the law yet that would not free us from the punishment already deserved by us

but the law must be satisfied both in respect of the penalty to be borne and in respect of perpetuall and perfect obedience to bee performed through out our whole life
neither may we thinke by the payment of one debt to satisfie another the obedience which wee hope to performe for the time to come though it were totall and perfect is a debt and duty which wee owe unto god luk

and therefore cannot discharge us of the penalty which is another debt which wee owe for our sinnes past for wee were sinners from the wombe

yea in the wombe and to the guilt of adams transgression in whom wee sinned and to that originall corruption which we have received from him for which though wee had no other sinnes wee were worthily subject to eternall damnation wee have added in the former part of our life innumerable personall transgressions all deserving death and damnation which if wee be not delivered therefrom by the death and merits of christ wee must make account to suffer in our owne persons neither can our future intended obedience satisfie for our sinnes as bellarmine confesseth
god is just

in forgiving sinnes neither doth he forgive any sinne for which his justice is not fully satisfied


iv
neither can our righteousnese atisfie the law in respect of the precept by fulfilling it for whosoever hath not continued in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them but hath at any time transgressed the law hee hath not fulfilled it
therefore it is most certaine that we cannot satisfie the law in respect of the precept because wee have already broken it and by our breach of it have made our selves subject to the curse of the law so farre are we from being justified by it
neither are wee able by our obedience to satisfie the law for the time to come

against this branch of our argument which by us is added

undefined span alphabet as over measure
bellarmine taketh exception alleaging that the faithfull and regenerate are able to fulfill

the law and entreth into a large dispute to prove that the law is possible which disputation

have fully examined in his due

place and confuted
here let the reader take notice that bellarmine disputeth sophistically in diverse respects· for first hee will needs be actor when indeed hee is reus and that hee might get the better end of the staffe pretendeth to confute our errours when indeed he laboureth to defend his owne
secondly hee answereth but a piece of our argument and such a piece as might be spared as being added mantisae loco by way of advantage for thus we reason no man can satisfie the law because hee hath already broken it yea hee is so farre from satisfying the law in respect of the time past that for the time to come hee is not able to fullfill it
thirdly where hee should prove that all those who are to bee justified doe fulfill the law for else how should they by fulfilling of the law be justified all that he endevoureth to prove is that it is possible for them that are already justified to fullfill it· disputing as wee say a posse ad esse
fourthly where hee should prove that all who are justified doe fulfill the law for else how should they be justified by fulfilling it hee endeavoureth to prove that some rare men have fulfilled it not caring what becomes of the rest fifthly where hee argueth that if men shall fulfill the law they shall be justified his consequence doth not hold in respect of them who at any time heretofore have broken it as all meere men without exception have done though they should perfectly fulfill the law for the time to come
sixthly he would prove that some doe fulfill the law and yet cannot deny but that even those some doe sinne many times yea seven times a day and that they have need daily to pray for the forgivenesse of their sinnes and therefore faileth in the proofe of that also as have made manifest in answering

his arguments


vi
now to make good this part of our reason will not content my selfe to have answered elsewhere all his objections againstit but will here also briefly propound some of our arguments to prove that wee meane all mortall men neither doe nor can by our righteousnesse and obedience fulfill and so even in that respect cannot satisfie the law
and first prove it by this most plaine reason

no transgressours of the law doe fulfill it
all men without exception of any but christ are transgressours of the law not onely the unregenerate but the regenerate also therefore no man whatsoever christ excepted doth fulfill it

the proposition needeth no proofe the assumption have proved before

and every mans conscience giveth testimony to it for himself

or thus

whosoever is a fulfiller of the law is without sinne
no mortall man is or can bee without sinne
therefore no mortall man is or can bee a fulfiller of the law


vii
secondly if any man could fulfill the law he might bee justified thereby rom

gal



but no man whatsoever can be justified by the law gal




rom


therefore no man can fulfill it
viii
thirdly those who cannot fulfill the first commandement of the two and the last of the ten cannot fulfill the whole law
but no mortall man is able to fulfill the first and last commandements
therefore no mortall man is able to fulfill the whole law
the first· which is the great commandement injoyneth us to love the lord our god with all our soules which being legally understood no mortall man is able to fulfill
for whosoever are in all the parts and faculties of the soule partly flesh and but partly spirit they cannot love god with all their soules
the most regenerate in this life are partly flesh and but partly spirit in all the parts and faculties of the soule
therefore the most regenerate in this life cannot love god with all their soules that phrase being legally understood

the last commandement forbiddeth all evill concupiscence whether habituall with which all men generally are infected or actuall from which none are free and those not such as are joyned with consent of the wil which are passions of lust for those are forbidden in the former commandements but such as goe before consent which are called undefined span alphabet]· with which all men without exception doe abound
neither is the commandement thou shalt not consent to lust but thou shalt not lust that is thou shalt have no evill concupiscence which as

augustine saith ought not to be bridled onely

but not to be for hee that hath concupiscences though he doth not goe after them doth not fulfill the law thou shalt not cove


ix fourthly by the testimony of saint peter act


that the observation of the law is not to be imposed upon christians as necessary to justification as being a yoke which neither the apostles nor their forefathers the patriarches and prophets were able to beare but that we are to be justified and saved by the grace of god through a lively faith· which purifieth the heart
bellarmine answereth that the apostle speaketh of the ceremoniall law which wee doe not altogether deny
but from hence wee argue as from the lesse
if the ceremoniall law were an unsupportable yoke how much more the morall for the ceremoniall law in it selfe considered was not unsupportable nor required any thing exceeding the power of man
for not onely the godly did performe it but hypocrites also who many times were more precise in observing the ceremonies than the godly themselves but as it was an appendice of the law morall as for example circumcision in it selfe though the most painefull ceremony might well bee borne
but as by it men were made debtors

to the whole law in such sort as they could not be justified but were under the curse if they did not observe the whole law it was a yoke unsupportable
for in that sense

the apostle speaketh when he protesteth to the galathians that if they were circumcised

christ should profit them nothing
and in that sense as it seemeth it was urged by the beleeving

pharisees that it was needfull that the disciples meaning all the christians of that time as well gentiles as iewes should bee circumcised and so required to keepe the law otherwise they could not be justified nor saved
and to that purpose tendeth saint peters

speech that it was not needfull to require the beleeving gentiles to be circumcised seeing it was well knowne that the gentiles were first called by his ministery had truly beleeved and had received the holy ghost who had purified their hearts by a lively faith by which without circumcision or other observations of the law they were justified as well as the beleeving iewes the iewes also themselves expecting to bee justified and saved by the grace of the lord iesus christ even as the gentiles were without the workes of the law as paul also reasoneth gal




fifthly by the testimony of saint paul and his experience in himselfe rom


from whence reason thus whosoever are not able to performe that which is good though by the grace of god they are willing to performe it they are not able to fulfill the law
but the faithfull and regenerate are not able to performe that which is good though by the grace of god hey be willing thereunto
therefore they are not able to fulfill the law
the assumption is proved from the example of saint paul as it were an argument from the greater
for if saint paul himselfe who in sanctity farre excelled any man now living did not finde in himselfe ability to performe that which was good but was so hindered by the flesh that the good which he would he did not how sholl those who are farre inferiour unto him bee able to doe it being the common condition of all the regenerate that by reason of the reluctation of the flesh they cannot doe those things they would gal




xi sixthly the apostle rom

doth acknowledge undefined span alphabet the impossibility of the law namely to justifie us
the reason whereof is not any defect in the law it selfe but our impotencie to fulfill it by reason of the flesh for if it were possible for us to fulfill the law it were possible to the law to justifie us but it is not possible to the law to justifie us by reason of the flesh and therefore by reason of the flesh it is not possible for us to fulfill the law whiles the flesh remaineth in us as it alwayes doth remaine even untill death
to these arguments if you shall adde the testimonies of the fathers which in handling the sixth question doe plentifully alleage

you will acknowledge that besides the authority of scriptures and evidence of reason we have the consent of antiquity that no mortall man is able to fulfill the law of god

cap vi
our fift argument containing foure branches by that we are justified by which we are absolved redeemed reconciled and for which wee shall be saved


the fifth argument
by what righteousnesse wee are justified

by it wee are absolved from our sinnes redeemed from our iniquities reconciled unto god and for it we shall bee saved and againe by what righteousnesse wee are absolved redeemed reconciled and for which wee shall be saved by it we are justified

by that righteousnesse which is inherent in our selves wee are not absolved from our sinnes nor redeemed from our iniquities nor reconciled unto god nor for it shall bee saved but by the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him wee are absolved from our sinnes redeemed from our iniquities
therefore we are not justified by that righteousnesse which is inherent in our selves but by that righteousnesse which is out of us in christ

the proposition in both the parts thereof containeth foure branches

the first by what righteousnesse we are justified wee are by it absolved from our sinnes and a converso by what righteousnesse we are absolved from our sinnes by that we are justified
this is proved from the signification of the word justifie as being a judiciall word opposed to condemnation which have at large proved before


for this doth invincibly demonstrate that by what wee are justified by that wee are acquitted and absolved and by what wee are absolved by that we are justified
but more specially it may bee proved out of act


where as have shewed before not onely the word justification and

remission of sinnes are promiscuously used but the phrase also of being justified from sinne signifieth plainely to be absolved from sinne where also the maine question itselfe is concluded
bee it knowne unto you saith paul to his brethren the iewes who feared

god that through iesus christ is preached unto you forgivenesse of sinnes
and by him all that beleeve are justified from all those things meaning sinnes from which yee could not be justified by the law of moses
from our sinnes therefore we are justified or absolved by the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith from which we could out be acquitted by any obedience which we could performe to the law


ii
but of this place we are further to speake in defence of calvins allegation thereof against bellarmines cavils
calvin prooving that

god doth justifie us when hee absolveth us from our sinnes and accepteth of us in christ alleageth this place
through this man that is christ is preached unto you remission of sinnes and by him all that beleeve are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses
you see saith calvin that justification is here set after remission of sinnes by way of interpretation you see plainely that it is taken for absolution you see that it is denied to the workes of the law you see it is meerely the benefit of christ you see that it is received by faith and finally you see that there is a satisfaction interposed where hee saith that through christ wee are justified from our sinnes

bellarmine pretending to answere this argument relateth it thus as if calvin had said first by this man that is by christ we are justified and not by any vertues or qualities of ours secondly is preached that signifyeth that the very preaching or declaring of the promise if it bee apprehended by faith doth justifie for so the apostle presently expoundeth himselfe by him every one that beleeveth is justified
thirdly forgivenesse of sinnes that signifieth that justification consisteth in nothing else but in remission of sinnes wherefore te inward renovation is not the other part of justication for that renovation is not so much justificaion as an effect thereof
and lastly these words from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses doe signifie that justification doth not consist in the observation of the law but onely as hath beene said in remission of sinnes for or through the righteousnesse of christ imputed thus as you see hee maketh calvin speake what hee pleaseth
but because the things which he inforceth in calvins name upon this place be for the most part our assertions it shall not bee amisse to weigh the answeres which he maketh to them

and first where it is said per hunc by this man hee saith this doth

not exclude our vertues or qualities infused of god
for by christ wee are justified as the efficient which is signified by the preposition per by vertues and qualities infused as the formall cause
now if christ or his righteousnesse bee the efficient cause then it cannot be the formall cause for the forme is the effect of the efficient nor can the same thing be the cause and effect of the same thing
neither may they say as they are wont that this is a mystery of faith that reason cannot attaine unto
for mysteries though they surmount reason yet are notrepugnant to reason
neither ought we to faine mysteries as the papists use to doe where the scriptures have an easie and perspicuous meaning
rply
this were a good caveat to the papists
as for us we faineno such mysteries neither doe we say that christ or his righteousnesse is both the efficient and formall cause of our justification
but this we say that the righteousnesse of christ is both the matter of our justification and also the merit both of our justification and salvation and that christ himselfe as he is mediatour is the secondary efficient of our justification affording unto it both the matter thereof and the merit


iv
that word is preached doth not signifie saith hee that by the onely preaching of scriptures apprehended by faith men are justified
for then

peter would not have said act


doe peance and bee every one of you baptized for remission of sinnes
but it signifieth that remission of sinnes is preached to all that beleeve in christ as they ought that is in doing whatsoever he commadeth to be done according to that mat

teaching them to observe all things whatsoever have commanded you
in this sence every one that bleeveth is justified that is whosoever beleeveth as he ought namely by fulfilling all things which faith doth declare ought to be fulfilled
for not he that beleeveth a physician though he be never so skilfull and one that infallibly curth is healed unlesse he receive such medicines as hee doth appoint

reply
wee doe not say that preaching alone apprehended by faith doth justifie but wee say that a true and a lively faith which is begotten by the preaching of the word doth justifie a man before god and that wicked is that aphorisine collected out of bellarmine

that by the preaching of the word of god faith is stirred up and so sinnes are forgiven is a fiction of the hereticks of our time
nay we say more that by the preaching of the word faith is not onely excited where it was before but that it is first wrought ordinarily and begotten by the ministry of the gospell
the papists ascribe the begetting of faith to the sacraments and the stirring of it up to the word
as if faith infused in baptisme did ly a sleep untill it be excited and awakned by the word

but the scripture teacheth us that faith commeth by hearing the word that preachers are ministers by whom you do beleeve that without

a preacher men cannot ordinarily beleeve rom

that men are begotten to god by the preaching of the word cor

that therefore preachers are their fathers in the faith that they justifie men dan


because they are the instruments of the holy ghost to beget faith in them whereby they are justified
why then doth peter require them to whom he had preached to repent and to be baptized answer that the holy ghost by peters sermon had wrought the grace of faith in the hearers before they were baptized act


as by pauls preaching act


in so many of the hearers as were ordained unto life in lydia act


by philips preaching in the eunuch act


by peters preaching in cornelius and his company act



and by this faith they were justified before god before they were baptized even as abraham was before he was circumcised rom

but that they might be justified also in the court of their owne conscience and much more that they might be saved many other things as repentance and a godly life with the use of the sacraments and of all other good meanes are required besides that faith whereby alone they are justified before god
and to this end did peter require them to repent and to bee baptized not that baptisme properly doth justifie and much lesse that it begetteth aith for in all these faith was wrought before they were baptized but because it is a seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith to them that are baptized not onely at the time of baptisme but whensoever or how long soever they beleeve
and whereas he saith that remission of sinnes is preached to those that beleeve as they ought confesse it is true that remission is not promised to an idle dead or counterfeit faith but

to the true lively and effectuall faith which in some measure purifieth the heart and worketh by love causing a man though not to fulfill all things that are commanded as bellarmine speaketh yet to will to desire and to endevour that hee may performe all things commanded according to the measure of grace received
but though obedience bee a necessary consequent of faith yet it is very absurd to confound it with faith as bellarmine here seemeth to doe



as for his similitude of the physitian answer the onely meanes to bee cured of the wounds of our soules which are our sinnes by our spirituall physitian which is christ is to beleeve in him and the onely plaisters to bee applied are his sufferings and merits for by his stripes we are healed esa

and the onely meanes on our part to apply them is faith
for even as moses lifted up the brazen serpent in the wildernesse that those who were bitten by the fiery serpents might by looking upon that which was but a figure

of christ be healed even so our saviour christ was lifted up upon the crosse that whosoever being stung as we all are by the old serpent and made subject to eall death shall looke upon him with the eye of a true faith shall bee saved
to which remedie alone all true physicians of mens soules do use to direct the wounded conscience when the iaylour act


in great consternation of mind came trembling and falling downe before paul and silas demanded of them what he might doe that he might bee saved they said beleeve on the lord iesus christ and thou shalt be saved
and this remedy in curing miraculously corporall discases was used sometimes with good successe mat




and was by our saviour himself prescribed as the onely receipt mar

vi thirdly where the apostle in this place nameth onely remission

of sinnes hee saith it hindreth not but that justfication may bee understood to consist in remission of sinnes and infusion of righteousnesse
for as we have not once shewed saith hee remission of sinnes is not onely the pardning of the punishment but also the washing away and cleansing of the fault which is not done but by the cleannesse of grace and comelinesse of justice comming in the place which the name of justification pretendeth being named from justice
reply
not once but very oft hath hee said that remission of sinne is the utter deletion and extinction of sinne and that it is not a distinct act from infusion of righteousnesse because by infusion of justice sinne is expelled as by the accession of heat and light cold and darkenesse is expelled
but as for condonation and pardon of the guilt and punishment that he hath utterly excluded from justification
for the pardoning of the guilt and punishment is not done by infusion of righteousnesse which as hee teacheth is the onely act of justification whereof there is but one formall cause which is righteousnesse insued as the councel of trent

hath defined but by imputation of the satisfaction of christ
for righteousnesse infused

as bellarmine hath confessed doth not or cannot satisfie for our sinnes
now if there bee but

one formall cause of justification as indeed there is but one and that one be not the imputation but the infusion of justice or as they rather

use to speake the justice infused which expelleth sinne which expulsion or deletion they call the remission yea the true remission of sinne then the forgivenesse of the guilt and punishment belongeth not to justification
but if the forgiving of the guilt and punishment be the not imputing of sinne which necessarily bringeth with it imputation of righteousnesse as bellarmine confesseth and the apostle proveth rom
viz that the lord imputeth righteousnesse without workes when hee imputeth not sinne then it will necessarily follow that imputation of christs satisfaction or righteousnesse is the onely formall cause of justification whereby we being absolved from sinne are accepted as just yea constituted righteous in christ
and that infusion of righteousnesse expelling sinne is another thing which the scriptures call sanctification
and this take to be a manifest truth which being granted we have obtained the whole cause


vii
fourthly againe saith he although there were mention made

in this place of justification only from sinnes yet in many other places there is mention made of sanctification of cleansing of washing and renewing which shew the other part of justification
reply we doubt not but the scriptures make mention of both these benefits sometimes severally and sometimes joyntly which though in use and practice they alwayes goe together yet they must bee carefully distinguished
and howsoever the scriptures often make mention of sanctification as well as of justification yet no where doe they make sanctification a part of justification
this bellarmine should have proved and not have craved
neither is it to bee doubted but that if forgivenesse of the guilt and punishment concurre unto justification as a part thereof renovation or infusion of righteousnesse being the other part as bellarmine here affirmeth thee are two actions and two formall causes of justification which themselves utterly deny
and therefore they must bee forced to acknowledge these two actions having distinct formes to bee justification whose forme is imputation and sanctification whose forme is infusion of righteousnesse


viii
finally saith he from which you could not be justified by the law of moses signifieth that the observation of the law neither by the strength of nature nor by helpe of the law alone presumed doth justifie not because the true observation of the law is not righteousnesse but because before remission of sinne the law cannot be kept
reply by the observation of law is meant all obedience and righteousnesse inherent whatsoever prescribed in the law whether it goe before faith and justification or follow after
for before as bellarmine truly saith the law cannot be fulfilled neither can there be any true righteousnesse
and that obedience which is performed after though it be a righteousnesse begun in us and be not onely accepted in christ but also graciously rewarded yet it cannot satisfie for our former sinnes nor justifie us from them
that which bellarmine addeth admit with some small qualification as making for us
for god saith he when by the merits of christ he reconcileth any man hee doth withall forgive his sinnes so saith the apostle

cor

which is all one as if bellarmine had said when god justifieth a man not imputing his sinne and accepting of him as righteous in christ then hee infuseth charity by which he may keepe the law which is all one as if he had said when god hath justified a man he doth also sanctifie him
this saith he is that which saint augustine so often repeateth and wholly maketh for us opera non prcedere justificandum that workes goe not before as causes of justification sed sequi justificatum but follow after as effects and fruits thereof
and this augustine speaketh not of such workes as perfectly fulfill the commandements for such there are none whiles they are stained with the flesh but of all good works which notwithstanding their defectivenesse are accepted of god in christ that which he addeth out of rom

have discussed

elsewhere


ix
but to returne to the proofe of my proposition to that place of the acts adde for the further proofe of the first branch rom
vers
where the apostle useth these words promiscuously justification and blessednesse and proveth out of psal

that this blessednesse consisteth in remission of sin or as he also speaketh in the not imputing of sinne and imputation of righteousnesse without works from whence this is proved by what righteousnesse we have remission of sinne by that we are justified and by what wee are justified we have remission of sinne
the second branch by what righteousnesse we are redeemed by that we are justified and converso by what we are justified by that we are redeemed
the benefit of redemption is explained by the apostle ephes


col
to bee remission of sinne and expressed by the phrase of redeeming from all iniquttie tit

psalm


the third branch by what righteousnesse wee are reconciled to god by it we are justified and by what we are justified we are reconciled
the apostle rom

useth these words promiscuously to bee justified by the bloud of christ and to bee reconciled to god by the death of his sonne and cor

god is said to reconcile men unto him in christ when hee doth not impute untio them their sinnes but imputeth unto them righteousnesse even the righteousnesse of god that is of christ that they only may be made the righteousnesse of god in him vers
the fourth branch for what righteousnesse wee are saved by that wee are justified and converso that which is the matter of justification is the merit of salvation for which cause justification and to be justified is many times expressed by salvation or to bee saved for they that are justified are saved in hope

and by what they are justified by that they are intituled to salvation and by what we receive remission of sinnes by that also we receive our

inheritance
iustification may bee compared to the institution of a minister unto a benefice which giveth jus ad rem glorification to induction which giveth possession and jus in re



come to the assumption the first branch whereof is that we

are absolved from our sinnes by the righteousnesse of christ and not by any righteousnesse inherent in us both wich are plainely averred

act


the former also is every where testified that the bloud of

christ was shed for the remission of sinnes and that it doth cleanse us from all our sinnes that he is the propitiation for our sinnes
the latter is also evident that we cannot be absolved from our sinnes by righteousnesse inherent first because it cannot satisfie for our sinnes secondly because it cannot stand in judgement
if wee should plead it before god we could not be justified thereby psal

neither are we able to answere him one of a thousand io

thirdly because our obedience though it were totall as it is never in this life yet it were a debt and we cannot be absolved from one debt by the payment of another when ye shall have done all things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to doe luk

the second branch that we are redeemed by the merits of christ and not by our owne righteousnesse needeth no proofe neither in respect of the affirmative that by his bloud we have redemption even the

remission of our sinnes that he gave himselfe

to bee undefined span alphabet a full price of ransome to redeeme us from all iniquity
nor in respect of the negative unlesse it may be thought that we who were held captives under sinne and satan

to doe his will could deliver our selves which god doth sweare to bee his gift luk

neither could we be delivered out of the hands of the strong man but by him

that is stronger than he
the third branch also is manifest both in respect of the affirmative that we are reconciled unto god by the death of his sonne rom

col
and also of the negative
for we were enemies when we were reconciled and such enemies as whatsoever we minded

was enmity against god rom

lastly the fourth branch needeth no proofe neither in respect of the affirmative unlesse it may bee thought needfull to prove that we are saved by the merits of christ nor in respect of the negative the scriptures so often testifying that we are saved by grace

through faith not by workes no not by any workes of righteousnesse

that we have done
so much of this argument which if should strive for number might stand for eight foure for the affirmative and foure against the negative

cap vii
containing sixe other arguments proving joyntly that we are justified by christs righteousnesse and not by ours


the sixth argument the righteousnesse by which we

are justified is the righteousnesse of faith and not of workes as saint paul

constantly teacheth

the righteousnesse which is out of us in christ is

the righteousnesse of faith or the righteousnesse which we receive and have by faith or the righteousnesse of god by faith the righteousnesse inherent is of workes
by that justice therefore we are justified and not by this



the seventh the righteousnesse of god by which wee are justified

is not prescribed in the law to justification but without the law is revealed in the gospell

rom


the righteousnesse which is out of us in christ was not prescribed in the law to justification but without the law is revealed in the gospell righteousnesse inherent is prescribed in the law to justification which in the question of justification is renounced in the doctrine

of the gospell
this being the maine difference betweene the law and the gospell that the law to justification requireth perfect obedience to bee performed in our owne persons the gospell propoundeth the obedience of christ which hee performed for us to bee accepted in their behalf who beleeve in him
wherfore let him be held accursed

though hee were an apostle though an angell from heaven who shall reach justification by the legall righteousnesse and not by the evangelicall
againe the law was given as the apostle

saith foure hundred and thirty yeares after the covenant of grace and promise of justification by faith in christ was made to abraham and therefore cannot disanull that covenant which was before confirmed in christ that it should make the promise of none effect which it would if the promise of justification were made upon condition of fulfilling the law


iii
eightly by what righteousnesse we are justified the justice

of god is fully satisfied
god being so mercifull in forgiving sinnes that he remaineth just rom

for though he proclaime himselfe

mercifull and gracious and abundant in goodnesse and truth keeping mercie for thousands forgiving iniquity transgression and sinne yet he protesteth that absolving he will not absolve that

is by no meanes will absolve such as ought not to be absolved that is such as for whom his justice is not satisfied
neither doth he indeed forgive any sinne for which his justice is not satisfied
but as every sinne deserveth death so it is punished with death either with the death of the party for whom he hath no other satisfaction or with the death of christ who hath satisfied the justice of god for the sinnes of all that truly beleeve in him

by the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him the justice of god is fully satisfied as bellarmine himselfe proveth and therefore professeth that in him he is well pleased
finally

saith bellarmine

nothing more frequently doth all the scripture testifie than that the passion and death of christ was a full and perfect

satisfaction for sinnes
he made the attonement

betweene god and us giving himselfe an offering and sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savour

but by that righteousnesse which it inherent in us the justice of god is not satisfied as

bellarmine confesseth
therefore wee are justified by the righteousnesse of christ which is out us in him and not by righteousnesse inherent in us

and here will make bold with bellarmine to borow a speech from him which he borrowed as it seemes from our writers to the confusion of himselfe and all other popish iustitiaries
for where osiander had argued that god accepteth for a satisfaction no justice but that which is infinite and consequently none but his owne uncreated and essentiall righteousnesse bellarmine answereth

god indeed doth not accept as a true satisfaction for sinne any justice but that which is infinite because sinne is an infinite offence
but that some justice may be finite that is of infinite price and valour it is not necessary that it should be the essentiall justice of god but it is sufficient that it be the justice of an infinite person such as christ is god and man
therefore the obedience the passion and death of the sonne of god though in it selfe and essentially it was a created justice and finite notwithstanding in regard of the person who obeyed suffered and died it was infinite and in the true rigour of justice it was a propitiation for our sinnes and not for our sinnes alone but for the sins of the whole world
from whence argue thus that justice which is of infinite value the lord accepteth as a true satisfaction for sinne and that which is not of infinite value he doth not accept for the offence of sinne is infinite
but the righteousnesse of christ onely is of infinite value ours is not therefore the lord accepteth christs righteousnesse and not ours as a true satisfaction for sinne


iv
ninthly they that cannot be justified without remission of sin

are justified neither by inherent righteousnesse because they are sinners nor without the righteousnesse of christ imputed without which as there can be no satisfaction for sinne so no remission of sinne

but no man can be justified without remission of sinne
therefore no man is justified by righteousnesse inherent but onely by the righteousnesse of christ



the tenth that is to be esteemed the true doctrine of justification

which doth minister sound comfort to the distressed conscience of the faithfull and that falfe which is a racke to the conscience of gods children when they are humbled under the hand of god

the doctrine of justification by the merits and obedience of christ imputed ministreth singular comfort to the distressed conscience of the faithfull even in the agony of death assuring the beleeving sinner that howsoever the devill accuseth the law convicteth the conscience confesseth his demerits yet notwithstanding if hee truly beleeve in christ he shall be accepted of god as righteous in christ and as an heire of eternall life christs sufferings and obedience being imputed unto him and accepted of god in his behalfe as if he had suffered and performed the same in his owne person

but the doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse is as it were a racke to mens consciences
for when a man being summoned to appeare before the judgement seat of god shall seriously consider with himselfe what he shall oppose to the accusations of satan to the conviction of the law to the testimony of his owne conscience confessing himselfe to be a most wretched sinner to the judgment of god the most righteous judge if he looke backe to his owne conversation as having nothing to trust to but his owne righteousnesse he shall finde sufficient matter of despaire
he may say with

anselme terret me vita mea my life doth terrifie me for being diligently examined my whole life almost appeareth either to bee sinne or barrennesse and if there seeme to bee any fruit therein it is either so counterfeit or unperfect or some way or other corrupted as that it can doe no other but either not please or displease god
and summoning himselfe before the judgement seat of god hee findeth himselfe to bee in great straits
on this side saith he will be accusing sinnes on that side terrifying justice under will lye open the horrible gulfe of hell above an angry iudge within a burning conscience without a flaming shall be hid how shall appeare to be hid is impossible to appeare is untolerable
to avoide these straits there is no way but to renounce the doctrine of justification by works or inherent righteousnes and to fly to the doctrine of the gospell teaching justification by the grace of god freely without respect of works through the merits of christ received by faith and to appeale from the tribunall of gods justice to the throne of his mercy
for whiles a man retaineth this opinion that he can bee no otherwise justified than by his owne good workes or inherent righteousnesse he can never be soundly perswaded that his righteousnesse is sufficient for that purpose but ever hath just caufe not onely of doubting but also of despaire
and this is the cause of that popish opinion that no man without speciall revelation can be assured of the remission of his sinnes or of salvation


vi
the eleventh and last argument shall be taken from experience
for when men seriously considering of their justification before god as a judiciall act of god as the word it selfe importeth shall sincerely

and in the feare of god set themselves before his judgement seat where they must receive the sentence either of absolution or condemnation and shall bethinke themselves what they being accused of satan and convicted by the testimony of their owne conscience have to oppose to the just judgement of god why sentence of condemnation should not passe against them they would utterly disclaime their owne righteousnesse
for as augustine and other of the fathers observe as before have noted out of the eight and nine verses of prov
joyned together cum rex justus sederit in solio quis potest dicere mundum est cor meum when the righteous king shall sit upon his throne who can say my heart is cleane yea the best of the papists when by deadly sicknese as gods messenger they have beene summoned to come before gods judgement they have beene forced to leave their and sophisticall distinctions and plainely renouncing their owne righteousnesse to rest wholly upon the mercies of god and the merits of christ
insomuch that many who have lived papists have in this most weighty point died reformed catholicks
and to this purpose there is extant among them in divers bookes a forme of visiting the

sicke wherein both the pastor is directed what to say and the sicke person is instructed what to answere
the pastor therefore having demanded these questions brother dost thou rejoyce that thou shalt dye in the faith doest thou confesse that thou hast not lived so well as thou ought doth it repent thee hast thou a will to amend if thou hadd'st space of life dost thou beleeve that our lord iesus christ dyed for thee doest thou beleeve that thou canst not bee saved but by his death and having received affirmative answers to every question he inferreth this exhortation that whiles his soule remaineth in him he should place his whole affiance in the death of christ and in no other thing and that if god will judge him if hee shall say unto him thou art a sinner that thou hast deserved damnation that hee is angry with thee he should say lord interpose the death of thy sonne betweene me and thy judgement betweene my sinnes and thee betweene mee and my bad deserts betweene me and thine anger
in the edition printed at venice

there are these two questions dost thou beleeve that thou shalt come to glory not by thine owne merits but by the vertue and merit of christs passion and a little after dost thou beleeve that our lord iesus christ died for our salvation and that no man can bee saved by his owne merits or by any other meanes but by the merit of his passion unto both which an affirmative answere was made but both blotted out in the index expurgatorius

cap viii
the disproofe of the popish assertion affirming that we are not justified by righteousnesse inherent


now we are severally to disprove the popish assertion

and to prove ours
as touching the former that wee are not justified by righteousnesse inherent

our first argument may bee this
that righteousnesse of god by which we are justified is not prescribed in the law as before hath beene proved rom

nor is that righteousnesse which is of the law phil



all inherent righteousnesse is prescribed in the law and is that which is of the law therefore inherent righteousnesse is not that righteousnesse of god by which we are justified
that all inherent righteousnesse is prescribed in the law it is manifest first because the law is a perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse whether habituall or actuall secondly because charity wherein they place their inherent righteousnesse even that charity whereby they are to love god withall their soules and their neighbour as themselves that charity which proceedeth from a pure heart from a good conscience and from faith unfained is prescribed in the law as the summe and complement thereof matth



tim




ii
to avoid this most evident truth bellarmine bringeth a frivolous

distinction as he applieth it to wit that there is justitia legis and justitia in lege or exlege the justice of the law the justice in the law or of the law
the justice of the law is that very justice which the law prescribeth or that justice which is described in the law and is not rejected by the apostle but commended
that justice which is in of or by the law is that which men without faith and without grace doe performe by the strength of nature onely holpen by the knowledge of the law
and this saith he the apostle doth reject as unprofitable and opposeth it to the righteousnesse of faith
saith he operibus bonis quae fiunt ex gratia fide that is to good workes which are done by grace and by faith
so that justitia fidei the righteousnesse of faith is now in bellarmines divinity become justiia operum the justice of workes

pererius to the same purpose bringeth a threefold distinction of justice that it is legis ex lege dei and inveigheth against calvin for that he tooke no notice of it being so plainely as hee saith taught by the apostle rom






iii
answ
this distinction cannot be collected out of the writings of saint paul who no where mentioneth undefined span alphabet the

righteousnesse of the law and much lesse distinguisheth it from that which is of in or by the law though the vulgar latine hath justitias legis where the greek is undefined span alphabet ro

and justificatio legis rom

where the greeke is undefined span alphabet but useth these termes to expresse our inherent righteousnesse undefined span alphabet rom

or undefined span alphabet phil


that which is of in or by the law which termes the righteousnesse of the law or that which is of in or by the law doe no more differ than undefined span alphabet rom

undefined span alphabet rom



undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet phil


the righteousnesse of faith or that which is of by or through faith
secondly the righteousnesse of the law is that which the law prescribeth as themselves define it and what doth that differ from that which is prescribed in the law thirdly of the righteousnesse of the law our saviour speaketh saith pererius matth


if thou wilt enter into life keepe the commandements
of that which is of or by the law moses speaketh that he which doth those things that are commanded shal live in them betwixt which two speeches of christ and moses there is no difference
fourthly if the righteousnes prescribed in the law could be performed then would the law give life according to that legal promise he that doth these things shall live thereby levit


ezek

gal


rom

and if there had been a law given which could have given life then there should have been righteousnesse undefined span alphabet of or by the law gal


and therefore that perfect righteousnesse justifying and giving life should be called undefined span alphabet the righteousnesse which is of or by the law
fifthly the righteousnesse of the law is as they teach necessarily required of all that shall bee saved and cannot be performed without grace and without faith and therefore according to their doctrine differeth not at all from the righteousnesse of faith hoc est saith bellarmine operibus bonis quaefiunt ex gratia fide that is from good workes which are done by grace and faith
so that by this goodly distinction the law and the gospell the law of workes and the law of faith the righteousnesse of the law and the righteousnesse of faith are confounded
for the righteousnesse of the law is charity proceeding from grace and from faith tim


and the righteousnesse of faith as bellarmine here teacheth are good works proceeding from grace and faith
and yet deny not but that great difference is to be made between the seeming obedience performed by carnal men without faith without grace which cannot truely be called righteousnesse and the new obedience of men spirituall and regenerate proceeding from faith working by love as the fruits of the spirit
but neither the one nor the other is the righteousnesse of faith
the new obedience of the faithfull is indeed a righteousnesse begun and performed in some measure undefined span alphabet according to the law act


undefined span alphabet according to the commandements iohn
but the righteousnesse of faith is this that hee who beleeveth in christ in that hee beleeveth fulfilleth the law

undefined span alphabet he that beleeveth in christ fulfilleth the law saith photius

and likewise primasius

qui in christo credit ipse perficit legem for to him christ is undefined span alphabet the end and complement of the law rom

and in him by christ undefined span alphabet that which the law requireth to justification is fulfilled rom

chrysostome

the end of the law saith he was that a man might be justified but this end christ undefined span alphabet more amply performed by faith feare not therefore saith hee because thou art a transgressour of the law seeing thou art come to faith
for then doest thou transgresse the law when by reason of it thou doest not beleeve in christ but if thou doest beleeve in him undefined span alphabet thou hast also fulfilled the law and much more than it commanded undefined span alphabet for thou hast received a much greater righteousnesse viz the righteousnesse of christ which is the righteousnesse of faith


iv
yea but augustine hath this distinction denying those

who have justitiam in lege or ex lege in or by the law to fulfill justitiam legis the righteousnesse of the law
answer that augustine disputing against the pelagians who held that men might fulfill the righteousnesse of the law by the strength of nature saith that they might have a kind of righteousnesse in the law or by it which notwithstanding did not fulfill the righteousnesse of the law which could not bee done without the grace of the spirit
by the justice of the law augustine meaneth that which the apostle calleth undefined span alphabet for otherwise paul never so much as nameth the righteousnesse of the law that is whatsoever the law requireth to justification
this justice of the law augustine considereth in the abstract as bellarmine also himselse doth in his first booke

for that righteousnesse of the law as it is described in the booke of the law being perfect and compleate which bellarmine saith is properly called the justice of the law of which hee saith justitia legis est in libris the justice of the law is in bookes even as habituall righteousnesse is in the heart and actuall in the hands
the justice in and by the law hee considereth in the concrete with relation to the subject in whom it is viz for that righteousnesse which men attaine unto by their observation of the law written
and hee proveth against the pelagians that the righteousnesse which they seemed to have in lege or ex lege in or by the law did not fulfill justitiam legis the righteousnesse of the law unto which wee may adde against the papists that all the righteousnesse even of the faithfull also and regenerate though endevouring to live according to the law and according to the commandements which they have in or by the law doth not fulfill the righteousnesse of the law which paul calleth undefined span alphabet which christ onely fulfilled for us by whose undefined span alphabet hee being but one we are justified rom

for as the undefined span alphabet or guilt by the fall of one man came upon all undefined span alphabet to condemnation so by the undefined span alphabet the righteousnesse of one whereby hee fulfilled the law· undefined span alphabet the grace of absolution and of gods acceptation redounded upon all unto justification of life
and thus this distinction

maketh against the papists
for justitia legis the justice of the law considered in the abstract as it is described in the booke of the law being most perfect is never fulfilled by that righteousnesse of the concrete in or by the law which men not onely carnall but spirituall also attaine unto by their observation of the law being alwayes unperfect in this life and stained with the flesh
for even as it may bee said of all other graces which being considered in the abstract are perfect and are so defined but considered in the concrete as they be in men who have received but the first fruits

of the spirit according to the measure of the donation

of christ they are unperfect so the righteousnesse of the law as it is taught in the law and as it was performed by christ is perfect but as it is in all mortall men it is unperfect
therefore righteousnesse inherent in us is not that righteousnesse of god by which we are justified


our second argument
that doctrine which confoundeth

the righteousnesse of the law and of the gospell and by confounding them maketh void the covenant of grace is false and antichristian

the popish doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse confoundeth the righteousnesse of the law and of the gospell and maketh void the covenant of grace
therefore it is false and antichristian

the assumption is thus proved whosoever maketh the condition of justification to be the perfect fulfilling of the law in our owne persons confoundeth the gospell with the law
for the righteousnesse of the law is the man that doth these things which are prescribed in the law shall live by them but the true condition of the gospell is beleeve in christ and thou shalt be saved
he also maketh void the covenant of grace
for if justification be promised upon condition of perfect obedience or righteousnesse which condition is impossible by reason of the flesh then is the promise void and of none effect
but the papists make the condition of justification to bee the perfect fulfilling of the law in our owne persons or perfect righteousnesse inherent
againe whosoever are made debtours to the whole law to them not onely the covenant of grace is void but christ himselfe is of none effect as the apostle teacheth gal


but they who must bee justified by inherent righteousnesse are made debrours to the whole law which they must perfectly fulfill else they cannot bee justified
but of this more

hereafter


vi
our third argument that doctrine which depriveth christians

of the chiefe part of that christian liberty wherewith christ hath made us free is false and antichristian
the popish doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse depriveth christians of the chiefe part of that christian liberty wherewith christ hath made us free the chiefe part of our liberty is that which we have by justification wherein wee are freed from hell and intitled to heaven
and that is a freedome from a double yoke of most grievous bondage wherein all are held that are under the law the former in respect of the curse under

which all are who in the least degree at any time transgresse the law gal


which all do both oft and grievously the other in respect of the rigour of the law excluding all men from justification and salvation who doe not perfectly fulfill it which by reason of the flesh is unpossible
but by the popish doctrine the benefit of justification it selfe is taken away as have shewed and with it the liberty which we have by it
for if we cannot be justified but by perfect inherent righeousnes then are we subject to the curse then are we excluded from all possibility of justification and salvation as being sinners in our selves wherefore all those who will stand fast

in that liberty wherewith christ hath made us free must abhorre the doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse which intangleth the imbracers of it with this double yoke of bondage whereby they are subjected to the curse and damnation and are excluded from heaven and salvation


vii
our fourth argument no sinners whiles they remaine

sinners are justified by righteousnesse inherent

all men whatsoever christ alwayes excepted are sinners as proved

before and so remaine whiles they remaine in the flesh

therefore no man whatsoever is justified by righteousnesse inherent

this seemeth to be the apostle argument in the three first chapters of the epistle to the romans whosoever are sinners they are not justified by the works of the law that is to say by no righteousnesse inherent in themselves or performed by themselves
all mortall men whatsoever both iewes and gentiles are sinners which hee proveth at large
therefore no mortall man whatsoever is justified by the works of the law that is by righteousnesse inherent


viii
our fifth argument none that are accursed by the law

are justified by their obedience to the law for to bee justified is to bee blessed rom


all mortall men without exception are accursed by the law as the apostle proveth gal


because all without exception have broken the law
therefore none are justified by their obedience to the law and therefore not by inherent righteousnesse


ix
our sixth argument whosoever is justified by inherent

righteousnesse fulfilleth the law

but no mortall man doth fulfill the law as have elsewhere defended and proved

at large
and thus

chrysostome argueth

no man can be justified by the law unlesse he fulfill the whole law but this is not possible for any man therefore that righteousnesse is fallen to the ground

to this argument adde a seventh as being a consectary thereof whosoever is justified by inherent righteousnesse and namely by charity he is justified by his owne fulfilling of the law
for charity is the

fulfilling of the law but no man is or can bee justified by his owne fulfilling of the law for none can fulfill it therefore none are justified by inherent righteousnesse


our eighth argument we are not justified before god both

by faith and by workes by gods righteousnesse and our owne by that righteousnesse which is out of us in christ and by that which is inherent in our selves
for the holy ghost maketh such an opposition betweene these as that they cannot stand together rom







phil


gal




eph

but wee are justified by faith by the righteousnesse of god through faith by christs righteousnesse which is out of us in him viz by his sufferings and by his obedience as besides the places even now quoted appeareth rom



therfore we are not justified by righteousnesse inherent in our selves

our ninth argument imputative righteousnesse is not inherent as being not ours nor in us but communicated to us by imputation
the righteousnesse by which we are justified is imputative that

prove first by testimony rom

for then is god said to justifie when not imputing sinne hee imputeth righteousnesse without workes
secondly by reason
the personall righteousnesse of christ is inherent in him and not in us being proper to his person though by imputation communicated unto us
the righteousnesse of god by which we are justified is the personall righteousnesse of christ pet

viz his passive and active righteousnesse rom


and that it is his personall righteousnesse appeareth evidently because it is the righteousnes and obedience of one onely wheras if it were a righteousnesse from him in us it would be the justice of so many as are justified so saith the councell

of trent justitiam in nobis recipientes unusquisque suam


xii
our tenth argument
that justification which the scripture

teacheth taketh away all matter of boasting rom

epbes



but justification by works or by inherent righteousnesse doth not take away all matter of boasting rom



eph


therefore justification by workes or inherent righteousnesse is not that which the scriptures teach we must therefore say with

ambrose that is profitable to me that we are not justified by the works of the law wherefore have not whereof to glory in my workes have not whereof to boast
and therefore will glory in christ
will not glory because am just but will glory because am redeemed
will glory not that am without sinne but because my sinnes are forgiven mee
will not glory because have beene profitable or because any other hath profited me but because christ is an advocate for me with the father and because his bloud was shed for me


xiii
our eleventh argument if there be no justification but by righteousnes inherent and that also perfect and pure then is justification promised upon an impossible condition and so consequently the promise should be void and of none effect
but farre be it from us to thinke that the promise of justification by christ is void and of none effect
therefore wee are not justified by workes or by righteousnesse inherent but by faith that the promise might bee sure to all the seed as the apostle reasoneth rom



xiv
our twelfth argument because unto justification concurreth

remission of sinnes as a necessary part thereof from whence three arguments arise first true justification is not without remission of sinne
the popish justification by infusion of perfect righteousnesse is without remission of sinne
for although they pretend that to their justification concurreth remission of sinne yet by remission they not understanding the pardoning or forgiving but the extinction and abolition of sinne have utterly excluded from justification the forgivenesse of sinne as have shewed before
secondly unto true justification necessarily concurreth remission of sinne
and where is remission of sin there is imputation of righteousnesse without workes
but in the popish justification there needeth no imputation of righteousnesse and that for two reasons which bellarmine doth prosecute at large in his dispute against imputation
the one because in justification by infusion of righteousnesse sinne is fully expelled and therefore no need of imputation
and secondly because the righteousnesse which is infused is perfect of it selfe without imputation of any other righteousnesse
thirdly if our justification and blessednesse doth consist in the forgivenesse of our sinnes as it doth rom

ex psal

then not in perfect inherent righteousnesse for where is neede of the forgivenesse of sinne there is no perfect righteousnesse inherent
and where perfect righteousnesse is infused there needeth not imputation of righteousnesse


xv
our thirteenth argument
if abraham david and paul

were not justified by righteousnesse inherent then much lesse any of us who are so farre inferiour to any of them

not abraham whose example was a samplar in this behalfe rom

for as abraham the father of the faithful was justified so are we abraham though he were a mirrour of piety abounding with good workes yet was not justified thereby
as the apostle proveth rom

for to whom righteousnesse is imputed of grace through faith he is not justified by workes before god and contrariwise whosoever is justified by workes to him the reward of righteousnesse is not imputed of grace but rendred as a due and deserved debt ver
to abraham righteousnesse was imputed of grace through faith vers
and
and therefore though hee abounded with workes yet hee was not justified by workes verse
or inherent righteousnesse but by faith without workes

not david for hee though a man according to gods owne heart

walking before god

in truth and righteousnesse and in uprightnesse of heart yet he desireth the lord that he would not enter into judgement with him for if hee did not onely himselfe but no man living

could be justified for himselfe he maketh this confession as

augustine understandeth him nam me invenies reum si in judicium intraveris mecum for thou shalt finde me guilty if thou shalt enter into judgement with me
and therefore he places his blessednesse or justification in the not imputing of sinne and imputing of righteousnesse without workes psal

rom

and professeth psal

will remember thy righteousnesse onely

not paul for he though he knew nothing by himselfe yet professeth that he was not thereby justified cor

though hee had lived after his conversion in all good conscience before god act


though herein he did exercise himselfe to have alwayes his conscience

undefined span alphabet cleare and without offence towards god and man yet in the question of justification he renounceth all his righteousnesse

inherent that he might be found in christ indued with his righteousnesse
and these we might adde iob esay and daniel who as well as the former

had that righteousnesse which is domino meane righteousnesse inherent but were not justified thereby see iob

xvi
our foureteénth argument the righteousnesse by which

we are justified is the righteousnesse and obedience of one and but of one rom

inherent righteousnesse is not of one but of so many as are indued therewith
therefore inherent righteousnesse is not that whereby we are justified

cap ix
the severall proofe of our assertion that wee are justified by that righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him



ow am to prove severally our assertion that

we are justified by christs righteousnesse
and first prove it by that argument which bellarmines useth against

osiander what righteousnesse god accepteth in our behalfe by that we are justified the righteousnesse of christ which he performed for us in the dayes of his flesh god accepteth in our behalfe otherwise saith hee why did the sonne of god take our flesh upon him why did hee humble himselfe to become obedient untill death
therefore by

the righteousnesse of christ performed in his manhood wee are justified


ii
hereunto adde a second out of the same place

for bellarmine though he holdeth against osiander that wee are not justified by the essentiall righteousnesse of the godhead yet he confesseth that the lord accepteth of no righteousnesse as a satisfaction for sinne but that

which is of infinite value such is the righteousnesse of christ onely in regard of the dignity of his person being the true god the great god god above all blessed for evrmore therefore by his righteousnesse only we are justified but of this see more

in the seventh chapter here argue thus what righteousnesse the lord accepteth as a full satisfaction for our sinnes by that we are justified

the righteousnesse of christ the lord accepteth as a full satisfaction for our sinne therefore by christs righteousnesse we are justified
by christs righteousnesse say imputed and accepted of god in our behalfe
the assumtion is thus proved
what righteousnesse is of ifinite value that and that alone the lord accepteth as a full satisfaction for our sinnes

the righteousnesse of christ is of infinite value as being the righteousnesse of god as it is often called
it therefore and by it alone the lord accepteth as a full satisfaction for our sinnes


iii
my third argument shall be from those places wherein either it is said that our righteousnesse is in christ esai

and that we are righteous in him cor

phil


or our saviour christ himselfe is said to bee our righteousnesse
ieremy prophecying of the messias the righteous branch whom god would raise to david saith in his daies iuda shall be saved and israel shall dwell sasely and this is the name whereby he shall be called iehovah our righteousnesse ier

and the very same prophecy is repeated ir

that the branch of righteousnesse should grow up to david in whose dayes iuda should be saved and ierusalem shall dwell safely and he who shall call her that is ierusalem his church for so it ought to be read is iehovah our righteousnesse cor

but of him ye are in christ iesus who of god is made unto us wisedome and righteousnesse and sanctification and redemption where christ is said to bee made our righteosnesse
to this

bellarmine answereth that christ is rightly called our righteousnesse for two causes first because he is the efficient cause of our justice
for as god in the psalmes is called our strength and our salvation because it is god that strengthneth and saveth us and in this place as christ is said to bee made our wisedome and redemption because he maketh us wise and redeemeth

us so christ is called our rightousnesse because he maketh us just viz by infusion of righteousnesse


iv
reply it is true that christ when hee doth sanctifie us by his spirit is the author of inherent righteousnesse in us but this is

that which followeth in the text that he is our sanctification
these two benefits as they are here distinguished so they ought not to bee confounded
bernard in a sermon of his doth oftentimes very eleganly goe over these foure unctions as he calleth them distinguishing justification and sanctification as we doe christ saith hee was made unto us wisedome in preaching justice in absolution of sinnes sanctification in his conversation redemption in his shadow of thine ignorance hee hath driven away with the light of his wisedome and by that righteousnesse which is of faith hee hath loosed the cords of sinne freely justifying the sinner by his godly conversation he hath given a forme of life and by his death he hath given a price of freeth from errour by his wisedome he covereth faults by his righteousnesse he giveth merits that is ability of working well by his life and rewards by his mine eyes lord that may bee wise remember not the sinnes of my youth and mine ignorances and am just lead me lord in the way and am holy but unlesse thy bloud mediate for mee am not was made unto us of god wisedome teaching prudence justice forgiving sinnes
they onely are wise who are instructed by his doctrine they onely just who of his mercie have obtained pardon of sinne those onely temperate or holy who study to imitate his life they onely valiant who imitate his patience



and that they are here to bee distinguished appeareth by

this consideration that in this text all the benefits which we have by christ besides our election which is also noted in the first words of him yee are in christ are reduced unto foure heads
for of god wee were elected in christ who of god is made unto us wisedome in our vocation righteousnesse in our justification holinesse in our sanctification full redemption

in our glorification that so we may learne not to boast in our selves

but to ascribe the whole glory of our salvation and of all the degrees thereof to iesus christ our alone and perfect saviour
to the like purpose

theophylact observeth the order here used by the apostle first he exempteth from errour and making men wise instructeth them to the knowledge of god then hee giveth the pardon of sinnes and by his holy spirit indueth them with holinesse and then granteth perfect deliverance from all evils which hee calleth redemption as chrysostome also and

ocumenius who observe the same order
and likewise theoderet he gave you true wisedome he gave unto you remission of sinnes vouchsafing unto you righteousnesse and he made you holy and delivered from the tyranny of the devill
all these foure benefits are the fruits of christs office of mediation as he is our prophet our priest and our king
for as our prophet in whom are all the treasures of

wisedome and knowledge he calleth

us by the gospell his doctrine

being our wisedome and making us wise

unto salvation as our holy priest hee justifieth us his sacrifice

and his obedience being our righteousnesse as our gracious and glorious king being ascended on high to prepare

a place for us he giveth

the graces of his holy spirit to his members whereby they being sanctified are fitted and prepared for his kingdome and being gone to prepare a place for us and us for it hee

will come againe to bring us undefined span alphabet

undefined span alphabet to the redemption of possession or our full redemption which is also called undefined span alphabet thes

undefined span alphabet thes

undefined span alphabet heb

the obtaining of salvation the obtaining of glory and the saving of the soule and undefined span alphabet the redemption of the body rom

christ therefore is of god made unto us wisedome righteousnesse sanctification and redemption or salvation because his wisedome is communicated unto us by instruction in our vocation his righteousnes is communicated unto us by imputation in our justification his sanctifying graces by infusion in our sanctification his glory by possession or fruition in our glorification


vi
in rendring the second cause he confesseth the truth whereof

desire the reader to take speciall notice
that christ is called our righteousnesse because he satisfied his father for us which his satisfaction he doth so give and communicate unto us when he doth justifie us that it may bee called our satisfaction and our righteousnesse
for although by justice inherent in us we bee truly called and are righteous notwithstanding we doe not by it satisfie god for our faults and for eternall thus saith he it were not absurd to say that christs righteousnesse and merits are imputed unto us when they are given and applied as if we our selves had satisfied god
and to that purpose he citeth

bernard who saith that christ died for all ut viz satisfactio unius omnibus imputetur that the satisfaction of one may be imputed to all but addeth this needlesse caution modo non negetur saith bellarmine esse in nobis preterea justitium inherentem ámque veram so it be not denied that there is in us besides a justice inherent and that true which if bellarmine would stay there we would yeeld unto
for we doe not deny that there is a righteousnesse inherent in those that are justified and that also a true though not a pure a perfect and absolute righteousnesse onely wee deny that we are thereby justified
wee are indeed just but by christs righteousnesse as bernard saith in the same place justum me dixerim sed illius justitiâ


vii
this confession of bellarmine dissolveth the very frame of

his owne doctrine of justification whereunto he hath taught that nothing concurreth but deletion of sinne and infusion of righteousnesse
and these not as two acts but as one act viz the infusion of righteousnesse expelling sinne
as for imputation of christs righteousnesse hee and his fellowes deride and scorne it
but here hee confesseth which needs must be confessed that in justification the satisfaction of christ is imputed unto us and accepted of god in our behalfe as if we our selves had satisfied god and that for that cause hee is truly called our righteousnesse
and this imputation he acknowledgeth to be necessary because by righteousnesse inherent we doe not satisfie for our sinnes and eternall punishment we say the same onely wee adde that this satisfaction made by christ in our behalfe is not onely his death and sufferings whereby he satisfied the penalty of the law and delivered us

from the curse himselfe being made a curse for us but also the holinesse of his person and the obedience of his life whereby he perfectly satisfied the justice of god infulfilling the commandements
now gods acceptation of christs satisfaction in our behalfe whereby he absolveth us from the guilt of sin and damnation by imputation of christs sufferings and his acceptation of us as righteous in christ by imputation of his most perfect righteousnesse and obedience is that very thing which wee according to the scriptures doe call justification which distinct benefit of christ not to be confounded with sanctification the papists must learne to acknowledge if they would bee saved


viii
to these adde other as plaine testimonies where it is

said that wee are justified by the bloud of christ and his obedience
from whence argue thus

if we be justifid by the bloud and obedience of christ that is by his passive and active righteousnesse then are we justified by the personall righteousnesse of christ which being proper to his person is out of us in him
but we are justified by the bloud and by the obedience of christ rom


therefore by his personall righteousnesse


ix
our fifth argument by what righteousnesse our sinnes are

covered as with a garment and by which we being indued therewith appeare righteous before god that is the matter of our justification
for he is justified whose sinnes are covered psal


by the righteousnesse of christ as a most pretious robe of righteousnesse and as our wedding garment our sinnes are covered
for as

iustin martyr truly saith undefined span alphabet for what other thing was able to cover our sinnes but his righteousnesse and wee being clothed therewith appeare righteous before god
therefore by the righteousnesse of christ we are justified
bellarmine

having as it were in our name objected to himselfe eph


which none of us that know of doe object for wee acknowledge the place to be understood of sanctification which consisteh in the putting off the old man and putting on the new hee saith that wee argue from the similitude of a garment as more fitly resembling imputed justice than inherent and that we confirme it by the example of iacob who being clothed with the rayment of his elder brother obtained the blessing



to this bellarmine shapeth two answers
first that the similitude

of a garment may fitly agree to inherent righteousnesse which wil not deny for in the scriptures theterme of clothing or putting on is of a large extent so that he will confesse that the hebrew labash and the greeke undefined span alphabet properly signifying to cloth or to put on apparrell which is not inherent in the body but adherent is more fitly by a metaphore applyed to signifie outward than inward indowments
and therefore that may come to the proofe of my assumption those phrases of putting on christ and his righteousnesse figured by iacob his putting on of his elder brothers apparell gen
of the wedding garment

mat

of the first or chiefe robe luke

of the white garment promised by christ apoc

of the fine linnen cleane and shining which is the righteousnesse of the saints
apoc

of which place have spoken before are most fitly understood of the righteousnesse of christ imputed unto us and put on as it were by faith


xi
in his second answere bellarmine confesseth that this similitude of garments and that example of the patriarch iacob may after a sound manner bee accommodated to righteousnesse imputed if it shall bee said that it behoueth us to put on or to be clothed with the merits of christ that being after a sort covered with them we may aske of god pardon of our sinnes for as have said before saith he christ alone was able to satisfie for our sins and indeed in justice did satisfie and that satisfaction is given and applyed to us and reputed ours when weare reconciled unto god and justified
that example therefore being referred to the righteousnesse of satisfaction for the fault it may be admitted
but if it be referred to that righteousnesse whereby wee are formally justified when of sinners and wicked men we are made just and godly it is by all meanes to be rejected seeing it is manifestly repugnant to the scriptures to the fathers and to reason it selfe
for that one man should satisfi for another it may easily be conceived but that one man should be just because another is just was never heard of and is not onely above but also against reason


xii
here as you see bellarmine maketh a distinction betwixt

the righteousnesse of satisfaction and that by which wee are formally made just
but what is that righteousnesse of satisfaction no doubt that whereby our saviour satisfied the law for us which he was to satisfie as have shewed before not onely in respect of the penalty threatened by his sufferings but also in respect of the commandement by his perfect obedience fulfilling the condition of the promise doe this and live
to this bellarmine acknowledgeth the similitude of garments and the example of the patriarch iacob may fitly be applied which is as much as wee desire
for this is the whole righteousnesse of justification wherein the lord imputing to a beleever the sufferings of christ covereth or not imputeth or forgiveth his sinnes and the punishment thereunto belonging and imputing unto him the perfect obedience of christ accepteth of him as righteousnesse in christ
for it is most certaine that to whom the lord imputeth not sinne them hee accepteth as righteous and that hee imputeth righteousnesse to whom hee imputeth not sinne rom

for as bellarmine himselfe confesseth the not imputing of sinne bringeth with it the imputing of righteousnesse
neither is it to be doubted but that the lord accepteth as well the merits of his obedience as of his sufferings
and what is that justice whereby he saith we are formally made just no doubt inherent justice or the righteousnesse of sanctification by infusion where of sinne is expelled
to this saith bellarmine the similitude of apparell and the example of iacob cannot be applyed
for though one may satisfie for another yet one cannot be formally just by the righteousnesse of another which never any of us to my knowledge affirmed
the more

absurd was bellarmine in thinking so absurdly of us
for because hee confoundeth justification and sanctification hee would needs beare the world in hand that wee confounding them also doe teach that wee are formally made just by the righteousnesse of another which is out of us in him
but if justification and sanctification are to be distinguished as have proved they must of necessity bee distinguished then it will appeare manifestly that that which bellarmine calleth the justice of satisfaction is the whole righteousnesse of justification and that by which hee saith wee are formally made righteous is the righteousnesse of sanctification
now wee are well content that the righteousnesse whereby wee are sanctified or formally made righteous should not be imputative so that they will confesse that the righteousnesse of christs whole satisfaction whereby wee are justified before god is imputed unto us which they must confesse or else they cannot bee saved
here therefore we may sing the triumph and say magna est veritas praevalet

and thus have aboundantly proved that the righteousnesse of

god whereby wee are justified is not any righteousnesse inherent in us or performed by us but onely the righteousnesse of christ our saviour which is out of us in him as being proper to his person though by imputation communicated to all that truly beleeve in him

chap
bellarmines eight allegations

to prove justification by inherent righteousnesse answered




now am to examine bellarmines proofes
and first hee alleageth rom

out of which place he would prove that to bee justified by christ is not to be accounted or pronounced just but to be truly made and constituted just by obtaining inherent righteousnesse and that a righteousnesse not unperfect but absolute and perfect for that to justifie in this place is to makejust and not to pronounce just appeareth first out of those words verse
many shall be constituted or made just unto which allegation have heretofore answered in his due

place so much as concerneth the signification of the word and have maintained the exceptions of calvin and chemnitius

against his cavils
his second reason is from the antithesis of adam unto christ
for thus saith he the apostle writeth
as we are made unjust through the disobedience of adam so we are made just through the obedience of christ

but it is certaine that through adams disobedience we are made unjust by injustice inherent and not

imputed

therefore through the obedience of christ we are made just by righteousnesse inherent and not imputed
answ
wee confesse that as from the first adam we receive inherent corruption in our carnall generation so from the second adam wee receive inherent grace in our spirituall regeneration but this is not our justification but our sanctification whereof the apostle speaketh not in this place whereas therefore he assumeth that wee are made unjust through adams disobedience by inherent injustice onely not imputed deny the assumption and returne the argument upon the adversary
as we are made sinners that is guilty of sinne and damnation by adams disobedience or transgression so wee are justified that is not onely absolved from the guilt of sinne and damnation but also accepted as righteous uto salvation by the obedience of christ
but wee are made sinners that is guilty of sinne and damnation by imputation of adams disobedience or transgession therefore wee are justified that is not onely absolved from the guilt of sinne but also accepted as righteous by imputation of christs obedience

as touching the proposition that the word sinners doth in this place signifie guilty of sinne and obnoxious to condemnation it is testified by

chrysostome undefined span alphabet what then is the word sinners in this place it seemeth to mee that it is to be subject or obnoxious to punishment and condemned to death by oecumenius undefined span alphabet and by theophylact likewise sinners that is obnoxious to punishments and guilty of death which exposition is plainely confirmed by the verses going before where the same opposition betweene the first and second adam being made the ormer part is expressed in these words that the undefined span alphabet or guilt of adams transgression came upon his posterity undefined span alphabet unto condemnation especially vers
and


ii
the assumption though by bellarmine in this place

yet is taught not only by other papists who fully contradict bellarmines assumption but elsewhere also by bellarmine himselfe
for durandus

pighius

catharinus doe hold originall sinne to be nothing else but the guilt of adams fall or the disobedience of adam imputed unto us which opinion also occam professeth that he would hold if he were not hindered by the authority of the fathers
yea saith

bellarmine it seemeth to have beene the opinion of some of the ancient as

peter lombard reporteth
refuting this opinion bellarmine justly findeth fault with them that they

held originall sinne to be nothing else but the guilt of adams disobedience imputed it being also the depravation of our nature following thereupon
but in that they say originall sinne is the disobedience

of adam imputed unto us that he doth approve
for adam alone did inded commit that sinne by actuall will

but to us it is communicated by generation eo modo quo communicari potest id quod transiit nimirum per imputationem after that manner whereby that may be communicated which is transcient and gone to wit by imputation
omnibus enim imputatur for it is imputed to all who are borne of adam because wee all being then in the loynes of adam when hee sinned in him and by him wee sinned
yea and farther hee rightly disputeth

that if adams sinne were not ours by imputation neither the guilt of it nor the corruption following upon it had belonged to us
·this assertion of bellarmine confirmeth our assumption and contradicteth his own alleaging that wee are made sinners through the disobedience of adam by injustice inherent and not imputed which also he contradicteth in other places
for he granteth

the sinne of adam so to be imputed to all his posterity as if they all had committed that sinne and to the same purpose citeth bernard


ours is adams fault because though in another yet we sinned and to us it was imputed by the just though secret judgement of god
and againe

taking upon him to prove that the propagation of sinne may bee defended without maintaining the propagation or traduction of the soule he saith that nothing else is required to the traduction of sinne but that a man be descended from adam by true and ordinary generation
for generation

not being of a part but of the person or whole man for homo generat hominem therefore the person descending from adam though his soule be from god was in the loynes of adam and being in him originally as in the roote in him and with him hee sinned the actuall sinne of adam being communicated unto him by imputatio
for as augustine saith definita est seutentia it is a resolved case by the apostle that in adam we all sinned


iii
but what shall wee say to the inherent corruption which

adam by his transgression contracted by this assertion it seemeth not to be traducted otherwise than as the fruit and consequent of the actuall disobedience which was the opinion of pighius and catharinus for as adam by his first transgression which was the sinne of mankind contracted not onely the guilt of death but also the corruption of his nature being both a privation of originall righteousnesse and also an evill disposition and pronenesse to all manner of sinne which is that macula peccati remaining in the sinner after the act is gone so wee having sinned in adam are not onely made guilty of death and void of originall righteousnesse but also are defiled with that habituall disposition and pronenesse to all manner of sinne
so that according to this assertion it may be defended that nothing in our generation is communicated unto us with the humane nature but the disobedience of adam which is communicated by imputation
as for the guilt of death and the inherent coruption they are not derived from adam but contracted by our sinning in him
and hereunto we may apply bellarmines distinction

of sinne so properly called that it is either a voluntary transgression or that blemish which remaineth in the soule caused and

contracted by the transgression being of the same nature with it diffeing no otherwise from it than as heat from the act of heating
for in the former sense originall sinne is the voluntary trangression of adam imputed unto us and is one and the same in all men in adam actuall and personall in us originall
for onely he by actuall will committed it but to us it is communicated after that manner by which that which is past and gone may bee communicated to wit by imputation
in the latter sense it is the corruption inherent contracted and caused as in adam by his personall sinne so in us by our sinning originally in him which though it bee alike and equall in all yet it is every mans owne


iv
but supposing originall sinne according to the received

opinion to be wholly communicated unto us from adam in our generation yet we must distinguish betwixt adams first transgression or actuall disobedience which we call his all and the corruption or depravation of his nature which thereupon followed
for though we be partakers of both yet not after the same manner
of the transgression we can be no otherwise partakers than by imputation
for adams transgression being an action and actions continuing or having a being no longer than they are in doing cannot bee traducted or transmitted from adam to his posterity
but the corruption being habituall is derivable by propagation
now the apostle rom
speaketh of adams actuall disobedience once committed by him by which he saith we are made sinners that sinne of his being communicated unto us by imputation and not of the corruption thereupon following
so by the like reason we are made just by the obedience of christ which hee performed for us in the daies of his flesh which can no otherwise be communicated unto us than by imputation

object yea but wee are truly made sinners by the disobedience of adam and truly made righteous by the obedience of christ
answ
as we are truly made sinners by imputation of adams disobedience so we are as truly made righteous by imputation of christs obedience
iust
yea but we are made sinners by injustice inherent through adams disobedience and therefore wee are made just by inherent justice through he obedience of christ
answ
we are not made sinners in respect of inherent justice by adams disobedience formally as

bellarmine saith inobedientia adami nos consituit peccatores non formaliter sed for that only is imputed but by the corruption which followeth and is caused by that transgression committed by adam and imputed to us
in like manner wee are not made just in respect of inherent justice by the obedience of christ whether active or passive formally for that is onely imputed but by the graces of the spirit merited by the obedience of christ performed by him and imputed to us



thus then standeth the comparison betwixt the first and the

second adam
as by the actuall disobedience or transgression of the first adam all his off spring were made guilty of sinne and subject to

death his disobedience being not inherent in them but imputed to them as if it were their owne because they were in him originally so by the obedience of the second adam all his

off spring are or shall be justified from sinne and accepted to life his obedience not being inherent in them but imputed to them as if it were their owne because by faith they are in him
and this is our justification by imputation of christs righteousnesse
and further as adams fall deserved as a just punishment the defacing of gods image by inherent corruption in all his posterity to whom the same corruption is by naturall generation transfused so the obedience of christ merited as a just reward the restoring of gods image in us by inherent righteousnesse in all the faithfull into whom the said righteousnesse is in their spirituall regeneration infused
and this is our sanctification by the spirit of christ of which the apostle speaketh not untill the next chapter where he sheweth that our justification is alwayes accompanied with sanctification
in a word from either of the two adams we receive two things which are contrary each to other
from the first adam his disobedience is communicated unto us by imputation whereby wee are made sinners that is guilty of sinne and damnation which guilt is opposite to justification and secondly the corruption which he contracted is transfused unto us by carnall generation which corruption is contrary to sanctification
from the second adam his obedience is communicated to us by imputation whereby wee are constituted just that is absolved from the guilt of sinne and damnation and accepted in christ as righteous and as heires of eternall life which is the benefit of justification and secondly the graces of his holy spirit which hee received without measure are in some measure as it were by influence infused into us by our spirituall regeneration


vi whereas therefore hee would prove out of this place that justification is the obtayning of righteousnesse inherent
answer first that to be constituted sinners by adams disobedience is to be made guilty of sinne and subject to death and damnation and so contrariwise to be constituted just or justified by christs obedience is to be acquitted from the guilt of sinne and damnation and to bee accepted unto life secondly that wee are constituted sinners by adams personall sinne which is not inherent in us but once and that long since committed by him so we are justified by christs personall obedience which is not inherent in us but long since performed by him thirdly that as wee are truely made sinners by imputation of adams transgression which is not inherent in us so we are truly made just by imputation of christs obedience which is not inherent in us fourthly that the disobedience of the first adam is imputed to all his children because they were in him originally as the root so in him they sinned and therefore when he did fall they fell so the second adams obedience is imputed to all the sonnes of god because by faith they are in him as his members the head and the members making but one body
this place therefore alleaged by bellarmine maketh wholly against him
neither doth that

which he addeth concerning persect absolute and abundant righteousnesse communicated unto us by christ agree to that righteousnesse which is in herent in us unperfect and but begunne as being the first fruits of the spirit but to the absolute and most perfect righteousnesse of christ communicated unto us by imputation
on this place have insisted the longer because though bellarmine alleage it as a prime place to prove his purpose is notwithstanding a most pregnant testimony to prove justification by impuation of christs righteousnesse as hereafter shall further appeare


vii
his second testimony is rom
which have also heretofore fully proved to make wholly against him lib
cap



his third allegation is out of cor
to which also have answered

before where acknowledged the benefit of baptisme to be here described according to that which here he alleageth out of chrysst
ambrose theophylact and others which is noted first generally in the word washed and then particularly in the words sanctified and iustified the former signifying the cleansing of the soule from the pollution of sinne the latter from the guilt of sinne the former wrought by the spirit of our god the latter by faith in the name of the lord iesus
and these two distinct benefits the scriptures ascribe to baptisme viz remission of sinnes and regeneration as shewed before
and therefore these benefits which the holy ghost hath accurately distinguished ought not to be either ignorantly or sophistically confounded
and whereas he saith that these benefits as here it is noted are wrought by the invocation of the name of christ and by the power of his spirit neither of which is needfull to justification by declaration or imputation he saith he knoweth not what
for to justification as we conceive of it to be granted and sealed in baptisme both these are as needfull as to sanctification
for to the obtayning of the remission of sinnes to be sealed unto us in baptisme invocation of the name of god is required act


and it is the spirit of adoption which by baptisme sealeth unto us the remission of our sinnes


viii
his fourth testimony is tit


whence hee argueth

to this effect

regeration renvation is formally wrought by some inherent gift iustisication according to the apostle in this place is regeneration renovation
threfore justification is formally wrought by some inherent gift

the proposition which no man denieth he laboreth to prove by three arguments which he might very well have spared but that he would have the world to thinke that we deny sanctification to be inherent
the assumption which do we deny he proveth by his own authority alleaging that in the fifth and the sixth verses the apostle describeth justification which indeed he doth not to be regeneration and renvation wrough in us out of the bounty of god by the laver of baptisme and effusion of the holy ghost
this we deny first because the word justifie never in the

whole scriptures is used in that sense secondly here the apostle in plaine termes saith that we are justified and saved not by works of righteousnesse whereby is excluded all justice inherent but by gods grace
how then doth he prove it because in these words vers that being justified by his grace wee might bee heires in hope of eternall life the apostle rendreth a reason why god by the laver and by the holy ghost did regenerate and renew us and saith the cause was that being justified that is saith he that being by that regeneration and renovation justified we might

deserve to be made heires of the kingdome and of life everlasting
answ
this glosse maketh the apostle not like himselfe but like a popish corrupteth the text which indeed doth paralell that cor

shewing how men converted from gentilisme to christianity shuld be exhorted to the performance of christian duties
for howsoever whiles they were gentiles they were addicted to many vices and sinnes yet after they were called which the apostle expresseth thus after that the bounty and humanity of god was manifested viz by the preaching of the gospel god not out of any desert of theirs but out of his meere mercy saved them by baptisme as saint

peter also speaketh that is justified them for that is the salvation we have here to bee intitled to salvation or saved in hope that being justified by his grace that is as he said before by his undeserved mercy they should be made heires according to hope of eternall life that is they might be saved in hope
of this sentence therefore stripped of its amplifications as it were its garments the naked substance is this
but after we were called god by baptisme justified us that being justified by his grace we might be saved in hope
the amplifications which are added are to set forth and describe baptisme unto us which as hee had noted to be the seale

of that righteousnesse which is by faith when he saith that god justified or saved us by it so he calleth it the laver of regeneration and of the renovation wrought by the spirit which god hath plentifully bestowed upon us
so that these words are not a description of justification as bellarmine dreameth waking but of baptisme
and they are added according to the purpose of the apostle in this place as arguments to move men to christian duties
why because baptisme as it was a seale unto them of their justification so also a sacrament of their regeneration and renovation of the spirit which spirit god hath poured forth plentifully upon the faithfull which he speaketh to this end that the faithfull which are baptized should make this use of their baptisme not onely as of a seale to assure them of their justification and salvation but also to be a sacrament token memoriall of their regeneration and renovation wrought by the spirit plentifully poured upon them
to which purpose the apostle telleth the

romans that so many as were baptized into christ were baptized into the similitude of christs death and resurrection whereupon the apostle inferreth in the next words vers
this is a faithfull saying and these things will thou shouldest affirme and confirme that they which have beleeved in god ought to bee carefull precedents of good

workes
the aposle therefore doth not say as bellarmine maketh him speake that we are justified or saved or made heires of salvation by regeneration or renovation and much lesse that thereby we merit our inheritance but that god hath justified or saved us sacramentally by baptisme which as it is the seale of our justification and salvation so it is also the laver of regeneration and renovation wrought by the spirit that being justified by his grace we might according to hope bee made heires of eternall life
for howsoever we are neither justified nor saved nor made heires of eternall life by our sanctification yet sanctification is both the way wherein from our justification wee are to walke

unto glorification
for god hath chosen us to salvation through the sanctification of the spirit thes

and therefore sanctification as it is a necessary consequent of our justification so it is a necessary

of glorification a necessary marke and cognizance of all that are justified and to be saved
and therefore ou saviour saith

that by faith in him wee receive remission of sinnes and inheritance among them that are sanctified and so the apostle also act




ix
his fifth testimony is heb
and some other places of the

scripture which doe give testimony to some men that they were truly and perfectly just and that not by an imputative justice but inherent his reason is because the scriptures would not call them absolutely just if they were not absolutely just
answ
to omit that it is one thing to be absolutely called just and another to be just absolutely and perfectly answere that the faithfull who are commended in the scriptures for righteous were righteous by a twofold justice both imputative and inherent
the former being the righteousnesse of justification the latter of sanctification the former absolute and perfect the latter inchoated and unperfect
by the former they were justified before god in respect of the latter though they were also called just yet they were not justified thereby that is they were neither absolved thereby from their sinnes past nor intitled to the kingdome of heaven as may appeare by all those arguments which before produced against justification by inherent righteousnesse
as for those examples which hee alleageth out of heb
which is the chapter of saith namely of abel vers
and noah vers
it is evident that they were justified by the righteousnesse which is of faith as is expresly said of noah vers
that is by the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith and imputed to them that beleeve for the righteousnefse which is of faith is imputative rom

and when it is said that without faith they could not possibly have pleased god

it is plainely intimated that by faith they pleased god and that they being besore justified by faith brought forth the fruits of faith acceptable unto god
by which their faith was approved
but as they were just by imputation that is to say justified so also by infusion that is sanctified
for the justifying faith being a lively and effectuall faith purifieth

the heart and worketh by

love and may be demonstrated by

good works

and where is not inherent righteousnesse concurring with faith there is no justifying faith at all
but although sanctification doe alwaies accompany justification yet wee are not justified by the righteousnesse of sanctification which is inherent because it is unperfect and wee are sanctified but in part whiles we have the flesh that is the body of sinne remaining in us
neither was there ever any man since the fall absolute or perfect in respect of inherent righteousnesse christ onely excepted


yea but saith bellarmine the scripture acknowledgeth some men to have beene perfect gen

immaculate psal

just before god luke


answere that this perfection is not legall as being a perfect conformity with the law which is the perfect rule of righteousnesse but evangelical as being one of the properties of our new obedience which is not· to bee measured by the perfect performance but by the sincere and upright desire and purpose of the heart
for this uprightnesse goeth under the name of perfection and what is done with an upright heart is said to be done with a perfect heart and with the whole that is entire heart
and likewise those men who were upright are said to have been perfect
and yet notwithstanding all those men who are said in the scriptures to have been perfect and to have walked before god with a perfect heart as noah iacob iob david ezkias had their imperfections· ezekias is said to have been a perfect man and to have served god with a perfect heart notwithstanding when god left him a little to try him he discovered his imperfections chr


of asa it is said chron


that his heart was perfect all the dayes of his life and yet in the very

next chapter there are three faults of his recorded where zachary is said to have beene just before god and to have walked in all the commandements and ordinances of god blamelesse in the same chapter

his incredulity is registred for which hee was stricken with dumbnesse and deafnesse for the space of tenne moneths
so that all that are sincere and upright that is to say no hypocrits are notwithstanding their imperfections called perfect and so the word which is translated immaculate psal

signifieth upright and to be righteous before god is all one with upright
thus the holy ghost teacheth us to expound the word which is translated perfect viz thamin and tham that to be upright is to walke before god is to walke before god and to walke before god is to be perfect gen

let perfection and uprightnesse preserve me psal

psal

observe the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace


xi yea but bellarmine will prove that these men which are in the scriptures called just were endued with inherent righteousnesse because they brought forth good workes which were the fruits and effects of their inward righteousnesse for he that doth

righteousnesse is righteous whom doth he now confute wee doe not deny them who are commended in the scriptures for righteous persons to have been endued with righteousnesse inherent but wee deny that they or any of them were justified

before god thereby
as for example abraham who abounded with good workes was justified by faith without workes rom

and as hee was justified so are all the faithfull
rom

david though a man according to gods own heart walking before

him in truth and righteousnes and uprightnesse of heart yet professeth that neither he nor any man living

could be justified if god should enter into judgement with them and therefore placeth his happinesse and justification notin his vertues or good works but in the not imputing of sin and imputation of righteousnesse without workes rom

paul though hee knew nothing by himselfe yet professeth that hee was not thereby justified cor

yea in the question of justification hee esteemeth his owne righteousnesse of no worth phil

but as wee doe not deny the faithfull to bee endued with inherent righteousnesse so we affirme that whosoever is justified by imputative righteousnesse is also sanctified in some measure with righteousnesse infused and inherent
in respect whereof though they bee also sinnes in themselves by reason of their habituall corruptions and actuall transgressions being in part carnall and sold under sinne

and by the law which is in the members led captive to the law of sinne yet they have their denomination from the better part
even as a wedge of metall wherein much drosse is mingled with gold is called a wedge of gold though not of pure gold· and an heape of corne wherein is as much chaffe as wheate is called an heape of wheate though not of pure wheate so the faithfull man in whom there is the flesh and body of sinne as well as the spirit and regenerate part is called of the better part a righteous man though not perfectly absolutely purely just in respect of his righteousnesse inherent
indeed every true beleever so soone as he is indeed with a true justifying faith is perfectly just by righteousnesse imputed but at the best he is sanctified onely in part


xii
his sixth testimony is taken out of rom

and cor



where it is said that the just are conformable to the image of christ and doe beare the image of the second adam as they have borne the image of the first adam from whence hee collecteth three reasons the first

as christ was just so are wee· and as hee was not just so re not we
but christ was just by inhrent rightousnesse and not by imputatin therefore we are just by inherent righteusnesse and not by imptation

the proposition he proveth by the places alleaged

first answer to the proofe of the proposition that the places alleaged

are impertient for the question being of the righteousnesse of ustification never any understood the aposte in these places to speake thereof but either of filiation as chrysostome and others understand the former plate because as christ is the sonne of god so also are wee or of afflictions because whom god hath predestinated to bee like his

sonne in glory they shall bee conformable to the image of his sonne in bearing the crosse which sence is given by our writes and is agreeable to the scope of the apostle in that place to the romans or of glory that when he shall appeare wee shall bee like him in glory of which as ambrose sedulius and others understand rom

fo the other place

being read in the future as it ought to bee in the latter branch as wee have borne the image of the earthy so wee shall beare the image of the heavenly is necessarily to bee understood
or of holinesse as oecumenius understandeth that place that as hee is holy so we should be holy also
neither is it to be doubted but that the image of god according to which we are renewed consisteth in true holines and righteousnes but that is the righteousnes of sanctification wherby we resemble the image of christ in true righteousnes holines
but the righteousnes of justification is christs righteousnes it self not the image of it


xiii
as touching the proposition it selfe wee must distinguish betwixt the thing and the manner
in respect of the thing it is true that christ is righteous and so are all his members
but in respect of the manner· it is not true neither generally nor adaequatè or reciprocally as bellarmine understandeth it who from thence argueth negatively as well as affirmatively
for things that be like are not like alogether and in all respects as may appeare by other resemblances in respect whereof wee are said to beare the image of christ
as first in respect of filiation
christ is the sonne of god and so are wee
true in respect of the thing but not true in respect of the manner
for hee is the sonne of god by nature and by eternall generation but wee are the sonnes of god in him by grace of regeneration and adoption
secondly in regard of the crosse
christ did beare the crosse and so do wee
true in respect of the thing but not true in respect of the manner
for christs sufferings were the undefined span alphabet the price of ransome which hee as our redeemer laid downe for us
but wee doe not suffer as redeemers neither are our sufferings undefined span alphabet a price of ransome but either undefined span alphabet

chastisements for sinne or undefined span alphabet trialls for our good

or undefined span alphabet our sufferings

for christ or undefined span alphabet that is such chastisements or corrections as the lord laieth upon his children having scandalously offended to vindicate

his owne honour
thirdly in respect of glory christ is glorified and so shall we who beare his image true in respect of the thing but not in respect of the manner for he as the head we as the members according to our proportion
fourthly in respect of holinesse or sanctification
christ was holy and so are wee true in respect of the thing for whosoever is in christ hee is a new

creature renewed according to his image in true holinesse but not in respect of the manner
christ was holy from his conception and originally so are not wee
christ in himselfe was perfectly just and holy without blemish of sinne so are not wee


xiv
but as touching the righteousnesse of justification we are not said to beare christs image
neither can christ bee said truely and properly to be justified as we are
for justification properly is of a

sinner and it consisteth partly in remission of sin
but if in respect thereof wee did beare christs image then in imitation of bellarmine wee might conclude as christ was not just nor made just so neither are wee
but christ was not just nor made just by the benefit of justification in like manner neithetare wee just or made just by the benefit of justification which is evidently false
but in respect of our justification we may rather use that similitude of the apostle cor

as christ was made sinne or a sinner for us so wee are made righteous with the righteousnesse of god in him
christ was made a sinner for us not by inherencie god forbid but by imputation of our sinne
therefore we are made righteous in our justification not by inherencie but by imputation of his righteousnesse


xv secondly he reasoneth thus if wee bee not just by iuberent

righteousnesse but by imputation onely or as hee speaketh like a cavilling sophister putativè and not indeed being indeed unjust then doe we beare the image of the devill rather than of christ
for more rightly have wee our denomination from that which we are than from that which we are onely suppsed to bee
answer first that whosoever is just by imputation be is not putativè onely iust but truely and indeed
for though he bee a sinner in himselfe as all but papists are yet hee is righteous or as the apostle speaketh the righteousnesse of god in him cor

secondly that the faithfull are just not onely by righteousnesse imputed which is the righteousnesse of justification but also in respect of justice inherent which is the righteousnesse of sanctification in regard whereof all the faithfull are called saints as rom


thirdly although the faithfull bee sinners in themselves yet being regenerate and sanctified in part they have their denomination from their better part and are called just though not purely and perfectly just as have shewed before


xvi
his third reason of the earthy adam who was a sinner wee

have borne the true image because sinne was not in us putativè but truely and indeed so the true image of christ wee shall beare if justice bee inherent in us not putativè but truely and indeed

answer
as wee receive two things from the first adam viz the guilt of his sinne communicated as bellarmine himselfe confesseth by imputation by which we were truely made sinners and truely obnoxious to death and damnation which is opposite to justification and by it is taken away and secondly the corruption of his nature which hee drew upon himselfe being propagated by carnall generation which is opposite to sanctification and by it in some measure and by degrees is taken away so from the second adam we receive also two things the merits of christs sufferings and obedience communicated by imputation by which we are truely made just and heires of eternall life and the vertue of his death and resurrection derived unto us by spirituall regeneration by which wee beare the image of the second adam as truely though not so fully in this life as by carnall generation wee did beare the image of the first adam
but this withall is to bee observed

that as we doe beare the image of the first adam in respect of the corruption derived unto us by generation and not in respect of the participation of his transgression for in him we sinned and were guilty of the same transgression with him it being communicated unto us by imputation so we do beare the image of the second adam in respect of holinesse and righteousnesse derived unto us from him in our regeneration by which we are renewed according to his image in true righteousnesse and holinesse and not in respect of our justification wherein the same righteousnesse and obedience which hee performed in the daies of his flesh is communicated unto us by imputation and accepted of god in our behalfe as if we had performed the same in our own persons
to conclude therefore it is not the image of christs righteousnesse and obedience by which we are justified but we are justified by the righteousnesse and obedience of christ it selfe


xvii
his seventh allegation of rom


is scarce worth

the answering wherein hee proveth which no man denieth that the godly doe truly and not putativè dye unto sinne and rise unto righteousnesse even as christ whose death and resurrection is represented in baptisme did truly dye and rise againe

for this dying unto sinne and rising unto righteousnesse are the two parts of our sanctification which never any denied to bee inherent
but that justification and sanctification are not to bee confounded have before

proved at large
if hee would have said any thing to the purpose he should have said any thing to the purpose hee should have proved that our justification consisteth in our mortification and vivification and then might he well have concluded that we are not justified by imputation but by inherent righteousnesse
but cannot sufficiently wonder at the blind malice of these men who either would perswade themselves or would goe about to perswade others that we hold the righteousnesse of sanctification and the parts thereof which we acknowledge to be wrought in us by the holy spirit not to bee inherent but imputative
as for these words vers
he that is dead is justified from sinne the meaning is as have shewed before

that he is freed from sinne as our translation readeth and as chrysostome and oecumenius expound it the speciall sense of freeing from guilt opposed to condemnation which is the proper sense of the word act


extended to the generall signification of freedome he that is dead is freed from committing of sinne according to that place of peter epist


which bellarmine paralelleth with this he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sinne


xviii
in his eighth allegation hee patcheth divers places of scripture together as it were invita minerva out of which nothing

can be concluded but that the papists have not one found argument to prove their justification by inherent righteousnesse
the places which he patcheth together are these rom

that wee now by christ have received the spirit of adoption of the sonnes of god quoad animam saith he in respect of the soule the which as it is there said viz vers
liveth

by reason of justification although the body be dead that is be mortall as yet by reason of sinne
but saith he little after viz vers
he addeth that wee having the first fruits of the spirit doe groane within our selves expecting the adoption of the sonnes of god even the redemption of our body
for as the same apostle saith phil



wee expect our saviour who shall reforme the body of our humility configured to the body of his glory
but the adoption of sonnes which wee expect in the redemption of the body shall be most true and inherent in the body it selfe that is to say immortality and impossibility not putative but true
therefore the adoption which now we have in the spirit by justification must also be true not putative otherwise as we expect the redemption of the body so also wee should expect the redemption of the soule
answ
see what poore shifts so learned a man is put unto according to the ancient profession of sophistres noted by plato undefined span alphabet to make good a bad cause
this is bellarmines whole dispute word for word where with much travell he hath brought forth this conclusion that our adoption which now we have by justification is true and not in conceit onely which we freely confesse
for whoever denied that our adoption is as true as our justification but doth it from hence follow that wee are justified by inherent righteousnesse a good syllogisme concluding that assertion from those premisses had beene worth his labour
the most that can bee said in this matter as suppose is this
that when our gracious god by his holy spirit doth regenerate us he doth beget in us the grace of faith
as soone as faith is wrought in us wee are engrafted into christ to us being in christ the lord communicateth the merits of his sonne by imputation of whose righteousnesse unto us hee remitting our sinnes doth not onely accept of us as righteous in christ but also in him hee adopteth us to bee his sons and heires of eternall life


xix
let this proposition then tanquam commune principium

bee agreed upon betweene us
such as is our adoption such is our justification and let us see what either of us can inferre thereupon
bellarmine assumeth thus but our adoption is not imputative for that suppose is his meaning by that odious word putative as though if it were imputative it were but putative which is most false
for he that either is a sinner by imputation of adams transgression is as truely a sinner as by transfusion of the corruption yea if he had not beene truely a sinner by imputation of adams guilt hee should never have beene punished either with the transfusion of the coruption or with death unto which by the guilt he was bound over or hee that is righteous by imputation of christs righteousnesse is as truely righteous before god yea more truely than by infusion of inherent righteousnesse
for that is perfect this is stained with the flesh and therefore is but a sinnefull righteousnesse which cannot stand in judgement before god judging according to the sentence of his law
but bellarmine assumption as was saying is this
our adoption is not imputative but by grace inherent therefore our justification is not imputative but by righteousnesse inherent
the assumption which is utterly false hee endevoreth to prove because the

apostle rom

saith that now by christ wee hae received the adoption of the sonnes of god quoad animam saith bellarmine that he might patch with it vers
in respect of the soule which as it is there said liveth prpter justificationem although the body bee dead that is to say mortall by reason of sinne
these places belmine alleaged before to prove that the grace by which wee are justified is inherent and namely charity because charity is that by which wee cry in our hearts abba father
secondly because it is said that the spirit liveth by reason of justification though the body bee dead by reason of sinne to both which have

before answered


xx
but here bellarmine maketh a twofold adoption the one

of the soule patched out of rom


the other of the body pieced out of rom

and phil


when as indeed adoption is not of either part but of the person or of the whole man who is adopted to be the sonne of god
neither doth the apostle speake of the adoption of the soule nor yet of the adoption of the body but of the redemption of the body from the servitude of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sonnes of god which is not the adoption of the body but the fruite of the adoption of the whole man which here by a metonymy is called adoption
the former he proveth by the latter not to be imputative but inherent
the adoption of sonnes which we expect in the redemption of the body shall be most true and inherent in the body it selfe that is to say immortality and impassibility not putative but true therefore the adoption which now we have in the spirit by justification is also true not putative but inherent
ans
in this similitude he should rather have said that as the adoption of sonnes which we doe expect at the redemption of our bodies that is at the resurrection is the everlasting inheritance whereunto wee were adopted as sonnes which a true and glorious inheritance though not inherent in the body but enjoyed by the whole man as adherent unto him so the adoption which we now have in the spirit by justification which is the entituling of us to this inheritance is a true adoption though not inherent but wrought by imputation of christs merits unto us
but suppose the adoption of the body as hee calleth it were inherent how doth it follow that the adoption of the soule as hee calleth it should also be inherent he saith it must bee so otherwise saith he as wee expect the redemption of the body so also we should expect the redemption of the soule which the papists had neede to doe whose soules shall bee in purgatory at the last day but from thence to be delivered at that day by a but say it followeth not for the adoption which is imputative is a most true adoption and wee need no other but the accomplishment thereof which is our full redemption
as for that adoption which he supposeth to bee inherent it is a meere fancie


xxi
now let us see what may from that proposition which

was agreed upon betweene us be truly inferred on our part
such as is our adoption such is our justification but our adoption is imputative and not by inherencie
for as have shewed heretofore

these

foure benefits reconciliation redemption justification and adoption doe not import any reall mutation in the subject but relative and imputative for when god imputing to a beleever the merits of his sonne forgiveth his sinnes which made him an enemy to god a bondslave of sinne and satan guilty of sinne and damnation the childe of the devill and receiveth him into his favour maketh him christs freeman accepteth of his as righteous admitteth him to bee his sonne he is said to reconcile to redeeme to justifie and to adopt him not by working any reall or positive change in the party but relative or in respect of relation
to be a father and to be a sonne are relatives when a man therefore hath first a sonne hee becommeth a father which hee was not before not by any reall change in himselfe but by a new relation which before he had not
when a man is adopted he becommeth the sonne of another man whose sonne he was not before not by any reall mutation but onely in regard of relation
for if the party adopted by god should by adoption bee really changed then god who adopteth should also seeme to bee really changed which is impossible because he is immutable
for as he which is adopted becommeth the sonne of god which hee was not before so god when he first adopteth any man becommeth his father which hee was not before
here therefore seemeth to bee a change as well in god adopting as in the party adopted not reall for that is not possible but relative onely which is a manifest evidence that as our adoption so our justification is not any reall change wrought in us by infusion of any inherent quality but a relative change wrought without us by imputation of christs righteousnesse

cap xi bellarmines arguments proving obliquè or indirectly justification

by inherent righteousnesse and first because faith is not the integrall and onely formall cause of justification




and these were all the arguments which bellarmine

hath produced to proove diectly his assertion concerning justification by inherent righteousnesse now follow two other ranks of proofes· whereby he doth obliquè indirectly and by consequence prove the same by disproving two assertions which it pleaseth him to father upon us
the one that faith is the onely formall cause of justification the other that justification consisteth onely in remission of sinnes
for if faith be not the integrall cause formall of our justification but that with it charity and other graces doe concurre by which as well as by faith we are justified formally then it followeth that wee are justified by inherent and habituall righteousnesse which consisteth in the habits of faith aud charity and other graces
and if justification doth consist not onely in remission of sins by which our soules are cleansed from sinne but also in the renewing of us according to gods image by infusion of righteousnesse by which our soules are not onely purged from sinne but also adorned and beautified with grace then it followeth that we are justified by inherent righteousnesse

the former question he disputeth lib
de justif
the title whereof is fidem non esse integram formalem caussam justificationis that faith is not the whole formall cause of justification
this opinion hee confesseth none of us doe now hold though falsly hee would lay it upon luther

and melancthon for we deny faith to bee the formall cause of justification at all and yet this is it which he and all of his side evermore object unto us to make us odious to the world as though wee required nothing to make us formally and inherently righteous but onely faith
and for this cause though wee hold not this assertion yet hee thinkes good to confute it as if we held it


ii
of his proofes onely the first serveth to prove that with faith charity doth concurre unto justification
it is taken out of gal



the fifth verse containing the latter part of the antithesis between justitiaries who were apostates from the doctrine of grace and the true prosessours of the gospell
for the former looked to bee justified by the law that is by obedience performed to the law and so were fallen from grace but the latter looked not to be justified by the law

but by faith that is by christs righteousnesse apprehended by faith
of this antithesis the latter part agreeth to us the former to the papists and therefore marvell to what purpose he alleaged the fifth verse unlesse it were to confute himselfe
now in the sixt verse the apostle sheweth what manner of faith that is which justifieth viz not a dead or a counterfeit but a lively and effectuall faith a faith which is effectuall or effectually worketh by love a faith which as saint iames

saith is not without workes but is demonstrable by good workes


iii
but these words bellarmine doth wilfully deprave
for in other places hee readeth and understandeth the wordes as wee doe following the vulgar latine translation unto which hee is tyed by the decree of the councell of trent reading fides quae per charitatem operatur faith that worketh by charity as our english rhemists also translate the words
and to seeke no further in the very beginning of the next chapter

where hee confuteth the erroneous opinion of osiander who held that the righteousnesse of christ whereby wee are justified is the essentiall righteousnesse of the deity dwelling in us saith that this errour is manifestly refuted by the apostle rom
proving the righteousnesse by which wee are justified to bee faith vivam viz per dilectionem operantem to wit a lively faith and working by love and likewise gal


we by faith expect the hope of righteousnesse for in christ iesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love
whereupon hee inferreth quòd si fides per dilectionem operans but if faith working by charity be that righteousnesse
but here for a poore shift and to serve his present turne hee interpreteth the greeke participle of the middle voice as if it were passive fides quae agitur faith which is acted moved formed and as it were animated by love
and therupon inferreth that charity isthe forme of faith and that faith justifieth formally as it is formed by charity and not otherwise and consequently that charity justifieth much more and hereupon also he buildeth afterwards that distinction of faith that it is either formata when it is acted by charity or informis when it is severed from it where also to helpe out the matter hee saith that the latine word operatur is passively understood whereof as suppose no example can bee given thereby making the translation barbarous and understanding it as never any before him understood

iv
but to begin with the last it were a strange speech if a man signifie

that the matter is acted by the form or that the body is acted by the soule should say corpus per animam operatur
and no doubt if the old interpreter had meant so he would have said agitur and not operatur
as for the geeke word undefined span alphabet it signifieth effectuall or effectually working and so both the verbe and the participle which are used nine times

at the least in the new testament are or ought to be effectuall namely in it selfe or effectuall to worke according to the twofold undefined span alphabet or act whereof the philosophers and schoolemen use to speake to wit the first and the second which distinction may be applied to habits

of grace or gracious habits
the first act which is the forme of faith or of any other grace is that tushijah that essence or entity whereof

salomon speaketh wherby any grace is that which it is called undefined span alphabet indeed and in truth which is the integrity of it and so saith thomas

actus primus est forma integritas rei in respect whereof faith and so every other grace is said to be undefined span alphabet

unfained
this is that principium agendi that inward act or efficacie whereby faith or any other grace is effectuall in it selfe lively active operative apt to produce operations according to their severall kinds without which faith or any other grace is dead and counterfeit and not that undefined span alphabet indeede and in truth whereof it beareth the name but aequivocè even as the counterfeit of any man is called by his name
the second act of faith or of any other grace is the actuall working thereof actus secundus saith thomas

est operatio
and these acts are either immediate and eliciti as the schoolemen speak or mediate and imperati
as for example the immediate or elicite acts of justifying faith are first to beleeve truly and effectually and by a lively assent that iesus the sonne of the blessed virgin is the eternall sonne of god the messias and the saviour of all that beleeve in him
secondly because so beleeve in christ to beleeve that hee is my saviour
thirdly by these acts faith receiving christ who is our righteousnesse doth justifie
the mediate acts which are called imperati are these acts which the immediate acts doe produce mediantibus aliis virtutibus by the mediation of other vertues
for if beleeve that iesus is the sonne of god and the saviour of all that beleeve in him and consequently that hee is my saviour hereupon shall be moved to trust in him as my saviour which is the act of affiance but commanded by faith and to expect salvation from him which is the act of hope but commanded by faith and likewise to love him and by love to obey him which are the acts of charity but commanded by faith as here it is said faith working by love



now those graces by which faith worketh as namely charity have not the respect of the formall cause unto faith but rather of the instrumentall neither doth faith worke by them as its forme but as its instruments as the soule by the body and the members thereof
but that charity is not indeed the forme of faith whereby it is acted and formed it may appeare evidently by these reasons
first because those which hold it to be the forme of faith deny it to bee the inward and intrinsecall forme whereby faith is that which it is which onely is the formall cause and as it were the soule of faith but extrinsecall whereby as they imagine the acts of faith are informed and so they make it by a strange kinde of logicke the forme of all vertues as well as of faith
secondly because one habit disparated from another as the three theologicall vertues faith hope and charity being also as themselves say seated in diverse subjects as the seat of faith is the mind of love the heart cannot possibly be the forme of the other
thirdly that habit which proceedeth from another as the fruit and effect thereof cannot bee the forme of that other
but charity which is the fulfilling

of the law proceedeth from faith unfained tim


for therefore doe wee love god and our neighbour for his sake because by faith wee are peswaded of his love towards us and therefore doe wee love him because hee loved us first ioh
fourthly if charity be the forme of faith then faith is the matter of charity for the mater is that which is formed and as it were animated by the forme but the consequent is absurd therefore the antecedent
and againe howsoever faith worketh those acts which called mediate or imperatos by meanes of other graces which acts doe tend to sanctification for which cause faith doth not sanctifie alone yet the actus eliciti or immediate acts of faith which are to believe in christ and by beleeving to receive and by receiving him who is our righteousnesse to justifie faith worketh neiby charity nor by any other grace and therefore it justifieth alone


vi yea but without charity faith is informis with it it is formata

answ
this distinction of faith that it is either formata or informis in a right sence may bee admitted as namely if by forme bee understood the integrity or inward efficacie and if that be called formata which is sound unfained lively and effectuall and that informis which uneffectuall dead and counterfeit
for that distinction is intimated by the apostle when he speaketh either of faith unfained or contrariwise of a dead faith for in the former it is implyed that there is also a fained and a counterfeit faith and in the latter that there is also a lively faith
and so wee admit this distinction that faith is either

formata which is lively and unfained
informis which is dead and counterfeit

but in the popish sence it is to be rejected and that in three respects
first because they propound this distinction as agreeing to a true justifying

faith as if a true faith might be without forme when as that which is without forme is dead and counterfeit and no more to bee called a true justifying faith than the carcase or counterfeit of a man is to be called a man
for howsoever such a faith may perhaps be true in respect of the object because it is of the truth yet it is not true in respect of the integrity efficacy and soundnesse thereof and that which is not truely faith is not faith undefined span alphabet or indeed
hee that saith either that he beleeveth that there is a god

and in deeds doth deny him and that he is just and feareth not to offend him or good and doth not love him or omniprsent and omniscient and feareth not to play the hypocrite before him such a one doth not indeed and in truth beleeve that which he proesseth himselfe to beleeve
he that saith he knoweth christ that is beleeveth in him and hath not a desire and care to keep

his commandements hee is a lyar and the truth is not in him
that faith which is dead and counterfeit cannot justifie or save a man as saint iames

sheweth
for howsoever faith alone doth justifie yet that faith which is alone doth not justifie neither alone nor at al becauseit is not a true and lively but a dead and counterfeit faith
neithercan that be a true justifying faith which is common to the wicked both men and angels
neither may wee omit bellarmines confession in this place
here saith hee

the apostle to prevent occasion of errour explaineth what manner of faith that is that justifieth non quaecunque fides sed quae per dilectionem operatur not every faith but that which worketh by love


vii
secondly this distinction is to bee rejected being understood in the popish sense wherein it is implyed that charity is the forme and as it were the soule of faith which opinion have already confuted
neither can they ground it upon iames

as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without workes is dead
for if the habit of charity cannot bee the forme of faith as have shewed then much lesse can good workes which are the outward fruits both of faith and of charity bee the soule of faith it selfe
of the profession indeed of faith a godly life is as it were the soule and without which it is dead but of faith it selfe it is not anima the soule but undefined span alphabet the breath as the word undefined span alphabet being derived from undefined span alphabet to breath doth properly fignifie in which sense it is often used being called the spirit of the mouth the spirit of the nostrils
and in this sense it may be said that as the body without breathing is judged to bee dead so faith without workes which are as it were the breathing of a lively faith is also judged to be dead not because it ever had lived but because it wanteth life


viii
thirdly this distinction is to bee rejected because as

bellarmine saith it is to be understood of one and the same faith which being informis may become formata and being formata may become informis againe remayning still the same but fides informis is not of the same kinde with that which is formata or justifying faith as things which be without life are not of the same kinde with those that are living or as counterfeits are not of the same kinde with those things which they doe resemble
besides justifying faith is divine the informis is humane that infusa infused and supernaturall this acquisita required by the strength of nature in the use of meanes that a grace of regeneration proper to the elect this a gift of illumination onely common to the reprobate that is vera being truely that whereof it beareth the name this simulata not being that truly which it is called but aequivocè that doth so beleeve in christ that it doth imbrace him and willeth and desireth at the least to apply him to the beleever this so beleeveth christ that either it is joyned with horrour as in the devils and desperate sinners or is severed from any will or desire of application this is without fruit and root and therefore is temporary that hath both root and fruit and never faileth
and howsoever that which is informis may by gods grace bee changed into formatam yet that which is formata can never be informis
no more than hee who is once borne of god can be unborne againe

the rest of his arguments serve to prove that faith is not the whole formall cause of justification that is as wee speake according to the scriptures of sanctification which we deny not for wee doe acknowledge a concurrence of many graces with faith unto sanctification
as for justification we deny faith either in whole or in part to bee the formall

cause thereof
neither doth any other of his arguments prove that either charity or any other grace doth with faith concurre unto justification

cap xii
that justification doth nt cnsist in renvation


his second ranke of arguments proving indirectly

justification by righteousnesse inherent is propounded in his sixt chapter the title whereof is this that or justification doth not consist in the remission of sinnes alone
neither doe we say it doth
the exclusive particle used by some of our divines doth exclude infusion not imputation of righteousnesse as

bellarmine confesseth
for wee doe hold though all perhaps have not so plainely expressed their meaning and some few have delivered their private opinions that remission of sinne is but a part of justification and that by imputation of christs righteousnesse we are both absolved from our sinnes and also accepted as righteous in christ and as heires of eternall life
but bellarmine howsoever he would seeme to acknowledge the concurrence of remission of sinne unto justification yet indeed excludeth it
for by remission of sinne concurring to justification hee doth not understand the not imputing or forgiving of sinne but the extinction and abolition thereof wrought by the infusion of habituall righteousnesse which expelleth its contrary as heat doth cold and light darkenesse
and howsoever there bee duo termini two termes in this motion or mutation

as he conceiveth of justification as being a passage or change from sinne to righteousnesse yet there be not two causes nor yet two distinct actions but the onely cause is justice infused and the action is but one and the same the infusion of righteousnesse expelling sinne
even as in creation which is transits non esse ad esse in illumination which is transits tenebris ad lcem in calefaction which is a passage from cold to heat
but if this be all that is required in the popish justification as undoubtedly it is the whole and onely forme thereof being infused of righteousnesse or as they love rather to speake righteousnesse infused their justification also not differing from that which the scriptures call sanctification saving that they dreame of a totall mortification or deletion of sinne and of a perfect renovation then what is become of the absolving of tom the guilt of sinne by which wee are freed from hell and the acceptation of us as righteous in christ

by we are intitled to the kingdome of heaven both which are wrought by imputation of christs righteousnesse in which true justification doth consist
for infused righteousnesse though it were perfect could not discharge us from our former debts and being unperfect as their owne consciences cannot but tell them it cannot entitle them to the kingdome of heaven
wherefore if they will be saved they must of necessity flee to the righteousnesse or satisfaction of christ who hath fully satisfied the law both in respect of the penalty by his sufferings and also in regard of the commandement by his obedience which obedience and sufferings being transient and gone so long since can no otherwise bee communicated unto them but by imputation
now if they can be content to acknowledge the imputation of christs satisfaction which sometimes

they doe and must doe if they will bee saved for there is no other meanes either to escape hell or to come to heaven then let them according to the scriptures acknowledge this imputation of christs satisfaction by which they are to bee acquitted and freed from the guilt of sinne and damnation and also accepted as righteous in christ and heires of eternall life to be their justification
as for the mortification of sinne and the renovation of us according to the image of god in true holinesse and righteousnesse both which are but in part and by degrees wrought in us by the spirit of regeneration let them bee acknowledged to bee the two parts of our sanctification


ii
but bellarmine will needs have our renovation to be the righteousnesse

of justification
and this he indevoureth to prove by testimonies of scripture by the authority of saint augustine and by reason
the texts of scripture which he citeth are six
the first rom



who was delivered up for our sines and rose for our justification
from whence bellarmine argueth thus to what the apostle giveth the name of justification in that justification consisteth rather than in that unto which hee doth not give the name but to renovation in this place the apostle doth give the name of justification and not to remission of sinne therefore justification consisteth rather in renovation than in remission of sinne

before answere thinke good to advertise the reader againe that bellarmine here by remission of sinne doth not understand the not imputing of sinne or as we in plaine english call it forgivenesse of sinne but the utter deletion the extinction the totall mortification of sinne
and that hee doth foure times at the least signifie in this one passage
now answer by denying his assumption because the apostle in this place doth give the name of justification neither to remission nor yet to renovation which is not mentioned so much as once in all the chapter
indeed in some other places the apostle and his disciple saint luke doe give the name to remission of sinnes that is to the not imputing of sinne or to the absolving and acquitting from sinne rom




but never to renovation


iii
his assumption bellarmine proveth because it cannot be doubtd

but that the apostles meaning was that christ his death was a samplar or patterne of the death of sin that is saith he of remission or deletion of sins and that his resurrection was a samplar

or patterne of our renovation and inward regeneration by which we walke in newnesse of life
and is this the meaning of the apostle then be like wee are justified by imitation and not by imputation of christs death and by imitation of his resurrection and then also by the same reason we are made sinners by imitation and not imputation of adams transgression
but indeed in this place the apostle doth not propound by way of exhortation the death and resurrection of christ as an example to bee followed in dying to sinne and rising to righteousnesse represented in baptisme as hee doth in the sixth to the romans where he exhorteth to sanctification as an inseparable consequent and companion of justification but by way of doctrine hee speaketh of the death and resurrection of christ as the cause of our justification of which he had spoken in the whole chapter and even in the verses next going before that righteousnesse shall bee imputed to us as well as to abraham if wee beleeve in him that raised up iesus our lord from the dead who was given by his father and by himselfe to us and for us that by the obedience of his life untill death but especially at his death he might satisfie for our sinnes and was raised from the dead that we might be justified and saved by his life which he liveth after his death christ by his death and obedience did satisfie for our sinnes paying a full ransome for them and so did justifie us meritoriously and in that sense we are said to bee justified by his bloud

and by his obedience both as the matter and merit of our justification
but neither his death nor obedience had beene effectuall to our justification if he had not risen from the dead
as the apostle sheweth cor
if christ bee not raised your faith is vaine yee are yet in your sinnes
for if christ had not risen againe it had beene an evidnce that he was not the sonne of god and then could not his obedience or sufferings have beene meritorious for us
but by his resurrection hee was

mightily declared to be the sonne of god in regard whereof it was said

thou art my sonne this day have begotten thee and being god his obedience and sufferings are of infinite and all sufficient merit and value vertue and efficacie for the justification and salvation of all that beleeve in him
and againe what benefits christ merited for us by his obedience even untill death the same being risen he applyeth and giveth to those that beleeve
god having raised him and exalted him

with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour to give repentance to israel and remission of sinnes
christ therefore was given unto death that hee might by his sufferings satisfie for our sinnes the penalty thereunto belonging and he did rise againe that by application of his merits we might bee justified
righteousnesse therefore shall be imputed to those that beleeve in the resurrection of christ or rather in christ raised againe who as he gave himselfe to bee a undefined span alphabet or price of ransome for our sinnes so he did arise againe that by effectuall application of his merits we might bee justified
so that whom by his

death and obedience he redeemed meritoriously then he doth effectually justifie and save by his life

and the severall actions thereof viz his resurrection ascension sitting at the right hand of his father as our king and priest his comming againe to judgement who therefore shall lay

any thing to the charge of gods children it is god that justifieth who is hee that condemneth it is christ that dyed yea rather that is risen againe who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intorcession for us


iv
in the words following bellarmine answeareth a secret objection

if remission of sinnes be ascribed to christs death and renovation to his resurrection then belike remission and renovation be two severall actions proceeding from divers causes contrary to that which hath beene delivered
for prevention whereof he saith it is to be noted that the death of christ which is the price of our redemption was not onely the cause of the remission of sinne but also of internall renovation
and the like as he saith afterwards may bee said of the reurrection
for according to the doctrine of the catholike church these two cannot bee severed frasmuch as one and the same grace viz charity being through the merit of christ infused and inherent in us doth both blot out or extinguish our sinnes and also adorneth the soule with righteousnesse wherefore though the apostle might have ascribed both remission and renovation either to christs death or to his resurrection yet he chose rather distinctly to attribute remission to his death and renovation to his resurrection propter similitudinem because of the likenesse which the extinction of sinne hath with the death of the body and spirituall renovation with the resurrection of the body whereunto answer briefly first that though the death and resurrection of christ in respect of their efficacie though remission and renovation alwayes goission and renovation then in justification there are two actions proceeding from two causes secondly that these foure distinct benefits remission of sinne and acceptation of us as righteous in christ which are the parts of justification wrought both of them by imputation of christs righteousnesse which is the one and onely forme of justification likewise the dying unto sinne or mortification and the rising of the sonle from the grave of sinne which is our first resurrection or vivification which are the two parts of sanctification those foure actions say proceed from two causes and that in twofold respects
for remission of sinne is procured by the merit of christs death and dying unto sinne is ascribed to the vertue of his death the imputation of christs merits whereby wee are both absolved from sinne and accepted as righteous is ascribed to his resurrection whereby his merits are applyed unto us for our justification and the grace of rising from the grave of sinne to the vertue

of his resurrection for by the same power whereby christ did rise againe are wee raised from sinne to newnesse of life



his second allegation is rom

that as sinne reigned

unto death so grace may reign by justice to life everlasting through iesus christ our lord where by justice opposed to sin he saith is meant inward renovation
ans
we deny not but that in all the faithful there is a two fold righteousnesse the one imputed which is the righteousnesse of justification the other infused and inherent which is the righteousnesse of sanctification which he calleth renovation
if therfore the apostle did speake here of righteousnesse inherent yet this place would make nothing against us
for we confesse that as sin reigneth in the children of disobedience by producing the workes of iniquity so the grace of god or the spirit of grace doth reigne in the faithful by bringing forth the fruits of righteousnes
but this is not the righteousnesse of justification but that wherein our sanctification doth consist
but indeed the apostle here doth not speake either only or chiefly if at all of inherent righteousnesse
neither doth hee in this place make an opposition or antithesis betweene sinne and righteonsnesse to which supposition bellarmines argument is grounded but betweene the kingdome of sinne reigning unto death and the kingdome of grace reigning by righteousnesse unto everlasting life through iesns christ our lord
now the righteousnesse wherein the kingdome of grace especially consisteth is the righteousnesse of justification by faith whereupon followeth peace of conscience and joy in the holy ghost rom

compared with rom


which being not our righteousnesse as all inherent justice is but the righteousnesse of god is chiefly

yea in the cause of justification is onely to bee sought after phil


rom

secondly as in all the chapter from the twelfth verse to the end the opposition which is made is of adams sinne to christs obedience so in this place as the sinne of adam was the cause of death so christs obedience of life the opposition is not of inherent righteousnesse to inherent sinne but of christs righteousnesse to adams sinne


vi
his third allegation is out of rom

doe not ye exhibit your members as instruments of iniquity unto sinne but exhibit your selves to god as of dead men alive and your members instruments of justice to god where by righteousnesse saith hee is understood something that is inherent and that hee goeth about to prove which no man doubteth of when indeed hee should prove not that there is a righteousnesse inherent in the faithfull for that wee freely confesse but that the righteousnesse which is inherent is that by which wee are justified
but it is evident that the apostle speaketh not heere of the righteousnesse of justification but of the righteousnesse of sanctification whereunto in this chapter hee doth exhort as to a necessary and unseparable consequent of justification
neither doth the apostle heere or elsewhere as before observed in setting downe the differences betweene justification and sanctification exhort us to the righteousnesse of justification or the parts thereof which bee not our duties but gods gracious favours for that were to exhort us to remission of sinne and acceptation to life
but to the righteousnesse of sanctification and the parts mortification and renovation and to the particular duties thereof hee

doth both here and in many other places exhort as namely in his sixth testimony cited ot of eph

from which hee would prove which no man doth deny that our renovaion according to the image of god standeth in righteousnesse and holinesse inherent


vii
his fourth allegation had need to be a good one for this

is the third time that hee hath cited and recited and as it were recocted it out of rom

the spirit liveth because of justification or as it is in the greeke the spirit is life because of justice
for justification or justice which maketh us to live and thereby to worke cannot be onely remission of sin but something inward inherent
answ
in this place vers

as shewed before the apostle setteth down a double priviledge of those in whom christ dwelleth by his spirit freeing them from the law of death
the one in respect of the soule vers
that howsoever the body bee dead that is as bellarmine himselfe expoundeth mortall or appointed to death by reason of sin which the first adam brought in and by it death his sinne being imputed to all yet the soule for so the word spirit is taken when it is opposed to the body is life that is as the antithesis requireth designed unto life by reason of that righteousnes of the second adam by imputation whereof all the faithfull are entituled unto everlasting life for as in the former part of the antithesis is not meant the spirituall death of men dead in sinne for that is the death of the soule and not of the body and the apostle speaketh of those in whom christ dwelleth but the corporall death unto which they also in whom christ dwelleth are subject so in the latter is meant not the life of grace or of righteousnesse but the life of glory
the other priviledge respecteth the body vers
that after it hath beene dead and turned into dust the spirit of him that raised up christ from death dwelling in us shall raise unto life eternall our mortall bodies


viii
his fifth testimony gal


where when the apostle saith

if there had been a law given which could give life or justifie as the rhemists translate the word vivificare then in very deed justice should be of law hee doth plainely saith he demonstrate that justice from whence justification is named is something which giveth life to the soule and hee doth place the same in motion and action
answ
if from this proposition propounded by the apostle bellarmine could have assumed the antecedent that so hee might conclude the consequent then might hee strongly have concluded against us that wee are justified by inherent righteousnesse
but seeing the apostle doth tollere anteceden that is intendeth to contradict that antecedent what reason hath bellarmine to argue as hee doth it is very true that if the law could have given us life that is as chrysostome and oumenius expound could have saved us according to that legall promise hocfac vives doe this and thou shalt live or as the rhemists translate could have justified us then undoubtedly wee might have beene justified by inherent righteousnesse
but forasmuch as it was impossible for the law to justifie and save us because it neither was no is possible for us by reason of the flesh to performe the condition and forasmuch as god therefore sent his sonne

to performe undefined span alphabet all that the law requireth unto justification that wee who could not bee justified nor saved by any inherent righteousnesse of our owne prescribed in the law and therefore not by a justice consisting in our actions or motions might bee justified and saved by the righteousnesse of christ imputed unto us what can bellarmine gather from hence with any shew or colour of reason to prove justification by such a righteousnesse as is inherent and consisteth in motion and action


ix
the sixth have already answered with the third

as for his testimonies collected out of augustine a briefe anwere

may serve that hee not considering the force of the hebrew and greeke words which never in all the scriptures are used in the signification of making righteous by inherent or infused righteousnesse but resting as it seemeth upon the notation and composition of the latine word justificare as not differing in respect thereof from the verbe sanctificare doth sometimes more largely extend the signification of the word justification than the scriptures use it as including the benefit of sanctification
but it is a most certaine truth that the word justificare being used in the scriptures translated into latine as the translation of the hebrew hitsdiq and of the greeke undefined span alphabet must be understood to signifie no other thing if it bee a true translation than what is meant by the hebrew and the greeke which as have shewed before doe never in all the scriptures signifie to make just by infusion of righteousnesse
and therefore it cannot be denied but that it is and was an oversight in them who using the word as mentioned in the scriptures and from thence borrowing it extend it to another signification than that of the originall wherof it is a translation
say againe as have said before that the fotce of the latine word in this controversie is no further to be respected than as it is a translation of the hebrew and the greek and as it is a true translation it must bee understood no otherwise than according to the meaning of the originall if it be understood otherwise then is it not a true translation neither is the sence of the word divine but humane
howbeit augustine differeth from bellarmine as touching the use of this word in two things first that hee doth not alwaies so use the word as for example when hee teacheth as hee and the rest of the fathers often doe that wee are justified by faith alone as hereafter

shall bee shewed they could not meane that wee are sanctified by faith alone
secondly remission of sinne which is the not imputing or forgiving of sinne is by augustine included in the signification of the word which by bellarmine is excluded who in stead of remission hath substituted the extinction and abolition of sinne
so that although he retaine the name which hee confoundeth with sanctification yet the thing thereby signified which is the maine benefit which wee receive from christ by which wee are both delivered from hell and entitled to heaven hee hath taken away as have heretofore declared
if this answere doe not content the papists let them understand that when the use of any word in the fathers borrowed from the scriptures differeth

from the perpetuall use thereof in the scriptures wee are bound to follow the infallble authority of gods word rather than the testimony of any man or men whatsoever
and for this wee have augustines

owne warrant who challengeth liberty to reject in other mens writings though never so learned andholy what is not agreeable to the scriptures
talis ego sum saith he in scriptis aliorum tales volo esse intellectors meorum



come to his reasons which are three
the first in every motion or mutation there are two termini a quo and ad quem the name being taken from the latter as in illumination there is a change from darknesse to light in calesaction from cold to heate
iustistcation is a mutation or change therefore in justification there are two termini a quo sc peccatum ad quem justitia from which it hath his denomination and therefore besides remisston of sinne there must accrew righteousnesse
answer that mutations are either reall or relative
if hee speake of reall mutations deny the assumption for have proved before that justification is no such mutation
if hee speake of relative mutations grant the syllogisme for even in such there are two termini as in liberation terminus a quo is bondage ad quem is freedome in marrying the change is from being a batchelor to bee a husband from being a maid to bee a wife so in reconciliation redemption adoption and so also in justification there is a change from guilt of sinne to righteousnesse imputed from being guilty of sinne and damnation to bee accepted as righteous unto life from being the bondslave of sinne and satan and obnoxious to hell and condemnation to bee not onely made a but also a citizen of heaven
in all these are great changes yet not reall or positive whereby any inherent forme either going before is abolished or new acquired but onely relative


xi
his second reason may thus bee framed if justification bee

given to us of god not onely that wee may escape the paines of hell but also that wee may obtaine the rewards of the heavenly life then justification doth not consist onely in the remission of sinnes which onely freeth from punishment but giveth not glory but the former is true therefore the latter
ans
all this wee freely confesse but first the thing principally intended that to justification besides remission of sinnes renovation concurreth hee doth not goe about to prove
onely hee proveth that justification doth not consist in remission onely in which wee agree with him though not in the other thing which is to bee added for wee adde making righteous by imputation hee by infusion or renovation
secondly the proofes of his assumption wee doe not approve
the first rom

yee have your fruit unto sanctification but the end everlasting life
the whole verse is this but now being made free from sinne and become servants to god that is being redeemed or justified ye have your fruit unto holinesse that is the fruit of your justification is your sanctification and the end of both is glorification or everlasting life
for this text doth neither prove that justification is not remission of sinne onely not that it is to bee confounded with sanctification which is here made the fruit of it

nor that it conferreth everlasting life
for if the holy ghost speaking of justification had mentioned onely remission of sinne without mentioning any other thing concurring thereunto as sometimes hee doth act




rom

his meaning might be that being freed from sinne and mancipated

to god that is redeemed for manu capti and servati are mancipia and servi and to bee redeemed is to have remission of sinnes eph

col

yee have the fruit of your redemption unto sanctification according to that luk

and the end both of your redemption and sanctification everlasting life his second proofe is rom
whom hee hath justified hee hath glorified for so might say to whom hee hath given remission of sinnes to them hee giveth the inheritance act


them he maketh blessed psal

them hee justifieth rom

act


and them hee glorifieth
and whereas hee saith that in that order of causes set downe in

that place every latter is the effect of the former as glorification of justification justification of vocation vocation of predestination that may bee a reason why in that serie causarum sanctification is left out because it is not the cause but the way to glorification eph

and the cognizance and character of them that shalbe glorified
act




his third proofe out of tim


there is a crown of righteousnesse laid up for me is nothing to the purpose
for as augustine

saith donando delicta fecit se coronae debitorem by pardoning offences hee oweth the crowne and bernard

there is a crowne of righteousnesse which paul expecteth sed justitiae dei non suae but of gods righteousnesse not of his for it is just he should render what hee oweth and hee oweth what hee hath promised


xii
but the assumption though not proved by him is approved and granted by us as agreeing with that justification which wee teach and disagreeing from that which is taught by the papists
for wee teach that in justification by imputation of christs righteousnesse wee are both freed from the guilt of sinne and damnation and also are in christ accepted as righteous and as heires of eternall life
and further wee teach that howsoever the parts of justification viz remission of sinne and acceptation unto life in the faithfull and the causes thereof in christ that is to say his bloud and his obedience doe alwayes concure for whosoever hath remission of sinnes is also accepted unto life and contrariwise and our saviour in his obeying suffered and in his sufferings obeyed yet the causes in christ and effects unto the faithfull are to bee distinguished
for by imputation of his sufferings properly wee are freed from punishment and by imputation of his obedience properly wee are entituled to the kingdome of heaven as have shewed heretofore
but in the popish justification there is neither remission of sinnes properly to free them from hell nor donation of such jutice as may entitle them to heaven
for neither the abolition or extinction of sinne present by infusion of righteousnesse though it were compleate as it is not can satisfie for their former sinnes nor can their righteousnesse being unperfect give them right to heaven
but

it is the onely satisfaction of christ by his righteousnesse and obedience both passive and active which being communicated unto beleevers by imputation doth both free them from hell and giveth them a title and right to the heavenly kingdome
his proofe taken from the courts of men admit as good against them who holding that wee are justified onely by the passive righteousnesse of christ doe make justification to bee nothing else but remission of sinnes
for they whom being guilty in themselves as we all ae before god a judge doth justifie are freed indeed from punishment but they doe not thereby obtaine new rewards
howbeit there is a great dissimilitude betweene gods justification of men and that of humane iudges
for a judge by his absolution though he doth free the guilty and indeed faulty parson from punishment and from the guilt binding him over to punishment and thereby perhaps bewrayeth his owne unjustice yet he doth not free him from the fault nor doth he make him righteous and much lesse doth hee indow him with new priviledges
but when god doth justifie a beleeving sinner hee doth not onely free him from hell and from the guilt binding him over to condemnation by imputation of christ sufferings but also by imputation of christ obedience he maketh him righteous and an heire of eternall life
and in thus justifying a beleeving sinner he is just

because christ by his sufferings hath fully satisfied for his sinnes and by his obedience hath merited for him eternall life

his third reason justification of enemies maketh us gods

friends children beloved citizens of heaven the domesticks of god heires of his kingdome as the scriptures every where speake therefore it doth not stand onely in remission of sinnes thus farre we agree with him
but as it is a good argument against those who hold justification to bee nothing else but remission of sinne so it maketh not for him who holdeth justification by infusion of righteousnesse but against him
for whereas the scriptures testifie that god when he justifieth men hee doth of enemies make them his beloved friends and his children
it is to be confessed that here is a very great change but is it reall or relative by infusion or by imputation surely when god reconcileth men unto himselfe and of enemies maketh them his favourites when he adopteth men and of the children of the devill maketh them his owne children when justifying men hee doth of foes make them his beloved friends of bondslaves not onely freemen but also citizens of heaven of alients his domesticks of men obnoxious to damnation heires of his kingdome hee doth not these things by infusion of any reall or positive qualities into them but these are externall favours which god vouchsafeth unto them when forgiving their sinnes and imputing unto them the righteousnesse of his sonne hee doth in him accept them for such yea and in respect of his relation unto them maketh them such as before they were not
and when he hath made men such by imputation he also maketh them such by infusion of such qualities and dispositions as are answerable to that which they are called

as shewed in the beginning whom god receiveth into his grace and favour them hee endueth with grace whom hee redeemeth from the servitude of sinne and satan hee maketh them his faithfull servants they who are the sonnes of god by adoption are also his sonnes by regeneration and finally those whom god doth justifie them also he doth sanctifie


xiv
and this is all which bellarmine hath brought for the

proofes of justification by inherent and infused righteousnesse either from the scriptures or from naturall reason
afterwards indeed in his eighth chapter hee produceth the testimonies of augustine and some others which he calleh the tradition of the ancient fathers as if they did agree with the doctrine of the present church of rome which they doe not
for first though some of the latine fathers led by the notation of the latine word which was not to be respected it being bnt the translation of the hebrew and greeke did under the name of justification include the benefit of sanctification whereof there is no example in the scriptures yet they did not exclude that which the scriptures call justification as the papists doe
for they acknowledged that justification containeth remission of sinnes and that it standeth chiefly in remission of sinnes that being our happinesse and therefore implying besides the not imputing of sinne acceptation unto life
the papists also talke of remission but their remission is not that which the scriptures and fathers speake of for the scriptures and fathers and all ancient writers whatsoever by remission understand veniam pardon condonation forgiving not imputing of sinne absolving from it which is a distinct action of god from infusion of righteousnesse that being a worke of god without us working no reall or positive change within us and herein wee have the consent of all antiquity
the papists by remission of sinne understand the expulsion or extinction the utter deletion or abolition of sinne which is not a distinct action as they teach from infusion of righteousnesse but one and the same action which is the infusion of righteousnesse expelling sinne and is an action of god not without us as the other but within us working in us a reall and possitive change
and therefore remission of sinne in the popish sense belongeth not to justification but to perfect sanctification as being a totall mortification of sinne which none attaine unto in this life but of this point have already treated in the second

question of the first controversie
secondly the fathers oftentimes use the word justification in the same sense that wee doe according to the scriptures as implying the forgivenesse of sinnes and acceptation unto life by the satisfaction and merits of christ communicated unto us· as namely when they teach as very oft they doe that we are justified by faith alone which they could not have taught if by justifying they had meant sanctifying for we are not sanctified by faith alone as all confesse
thirdly the fathers did not looke to bee justified before god by any righteousnesse inherent in themselves or performed by them but renounced it as being unperfect and stained with the flesh

and therefore where they speake of justification by inherent righteousnesse they meant sanctification and not justification before god whereof our question is
for they professe that by inherent righteousnesse no man living can be justified in gods sight as have shewed in this third

controversie and in the

fifth and

sixth

cap xiii
an appendice to this third controversie concerning the parity of justice



vpon this controversie concerning the matter of

justification dependeth another which is scarce worth the mentioning but onely to shew the blinded malice of the papists in propounding it and to vindicate our selves from their calumniations
bellarmine therefore de justif

propoundeth the question de paritate justitia of the parity or equality of justice whether all just men be in justice equall among themselves
for faine would hee have the world to thinke that we are like to iovinian or the stoiks calumniating us against the light of his owne conscience
for he cannot be ignorant but that wee doe acknowledge degrees of righteousnesse inherent and of the graces of sanctification not onely in divers men according to the measure of grace bestowed upon them some being incipients some proficients and some growne men but also in the same men every man being bound to labour that they may grow in grace and proceed from faith to faith untill hee come to a perfect man in christ


ii
indeed if the question bee concerning righteousnesse imputed we doe teach that in respect thereof all the faithfull are equally just
because as they are justified they stand just before god in the most perfect righteousnesse of christ by which the weake christian is justified as well as the strong
and in this regard the faith of gods children though unequall in degrees in some weaker in some stronger in some more and in some lesse is said by the apostle

peter to be undefined span alphabet a like pretious undefined span alphabet in the righteousnesse of god and our saviour iesus christ that is in that righteousnesse of god by which we are justified
and as the merit of christ is equally imputed to all that beleeve so the reward in respect of the substance which is eternall life shall be equally given to all that beleeve yet doubt not but that whom god in this life hath adomed with greater graces he will in them crowne his greater graces with greater glory
and therefore as saint

ambrose faith

he giveth qualem mercedem vitae on gloriae the equall reward of life but not of glory and

unus denarius non est unum prmium sed una vita una de genna libertio and

gregory there be many mansions with the father and yet unequall labourers receive the same peny because unto all there shall bee one equall blesseduesse of joyfulnesse though the sublimity of life be not one and the same to all


iii
but bellarmine though he confesseth that we doe not hold that either vertues or sinnes are equall and that we doe not deny but that both the same men may and ought to increase in faith hope and charity and in other vertues and that also divers men may bee more just than others in respect of such vertues as be in them but that wee hold that men being not justified before god by these vertues but onely by the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith wee are in respect of this righteousnesse by which wee are justified equally just
yet all his proofes are to prove the inequality and degrees of sanctity or inherent righteousnesse as though we denyed the same or held that paradox which may in respect of habituall righteousnesse more justly be imputed to the papists
for if incipients in religion yea infants in age be justified or made just as they teach with perfect righteousnesse infused what difference shall there bee betwixt baptized infants and the greatest proficients among them who dreame of perfection in regard of habituall righteousnesse saving that the infants justice may seeme to bee more pure from actuall concupiscences
but of this question more hath beene said than enough

a treatise of ivstification
the fifth booke concerning the formall cause of justification
cap containing five proofes that we are justified by imputation of christs righteousnesse


the fourth grand errour of the papists in the article

of justification is concerning that which wee call the forme thereof
for they denying and deriding the imputation of christs righteousnesse without which notwithstanding no man can bee saved doe hold that men are justified by infusion and not by imputation of righteousnesse we on the contrary doe hold according to the scriptures that we are justified before god onely by imputation of christs righteousnesse and not by infusion
and our meaning when wee say that god imputeth christs righteousnesse unto us is nothing else but this that hee graciously accepteth for us and in our behalfe the righteousnesse of christ both active that is his obedience which in the dayes of his flesh hee performed for us and passive that is his sufferings which he sustained for us as if we had in our owne persons both performed and suffered the same for our selves
howbeit we confesse that the lord doth infuse righteousnesse into the faithfull yet not as he justifieth but as hee sanctifieth them and consequently wee acknowledge that in all the faithfull there is true righteousnesse inherent but we deny that they are justified

by it
how am first to prove our assertion and to maintaine our proofs against the exceptions and cavils of the papists and then will answer their allegations


ii
my three first proofes shall bee taken from those things

which have already beene proved
and first those reasons which before

alleaged to prove the formall cause of our justification to bee the imputation of christs righteousnesse

secondly if to justifie in the scriptures doth never signifie to make righteous by infusion of righteousnesse or to make a man righteous formally by inherent righteousnesse then it is evident that the justification which the scriptures teach is not by infusion of righteousnesse
and if not by infusion then by imputation for a third thing cannot be named
but the former have

most evidently proved therefore the latter cannot be denyed

thirdly if we be justified by the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him and not by any righteousnesse infused or inherent in us then it is evident that we are justified not by infusion of righteousnesse but by imputation
but the former

have fully demonstrated therefore the latter must be confessed
for wee are justified either by inherent righteousnesse or imputed not by inherent as hath beene shewed therefore by righteousnesse imputed


iii
my fourth proofe shall be taken from the confession of our adversaries who doe confesse

that christ his satisfaction is imputed unto us which they understand but of the one halfe of his satisfaction and not all that viz in respect onely of the everlasting punishment and the guilt of eternall death
as for the temporall punishment which they say remaineth after absolution from the eternall they must satisfie otherwise
and as for satisfaction to the commandements the performance whereof is the condition of the legall promise doe this and live by which performance christ merited for us eternall life they say that christs satisfaction and merit is not imputed but wee our selves are to merit eternall life
but by the same reason whereby they have beene forced to acknowledge the necessity of that part of christs satisfaction made by his sufferings to be imputed to free us from hell they shall be compelled to confesse the necessity of the imputation of the other part of his satisfaction which is his obedience to be imputed to us to merit heaven for us
the reason why of necessity christs satisfaction by his death and sufferings must be imputed to us to free us from hell is this because nothing can satisfie for our sinnes which infinitely offend god and deserve an infinite punishment but that onely which is of infinite value
by the same reason nothing can give us right and title to the kingdome of heaven which is no lesse an infinite reward being the eternall fruition of the infinite good for god as he gave his sonne in pretium so he hath reserved himselfe in prmium but that onely which is of infinite worth and value and that is onely the merit of christ who is

iehovah our righteousnesse


iiii
my fifth proofe shall be taken out of that most pregnant place

and most worthy to be insisted upon cor

him viz christ the just who knew no sinne god made sinne for us that wee who are sinners in our selves might be made the righteousnesse of god in him
where these two words sinne and righteousnesse need some explanation
but the explication of the latter will cleare the former
there being a fit analogy betweene christs being made sinne and our being made righteousnesse
but it is evident that wee are said to bee made righteousnesse in the abstract when wee are made righteous in the concrete
and therefore by analogy when christ is said to bee made sinne for us the meaning is that hee was made a sinner for us
some because it seemeth an harsh speech to call christ a sinner though not so harsh when it is said withall that hee was without sinne doe rather by sinne understand a sacrifice for sinne as the word sinne sometimes is taken which acknowledge to bee a godly sence but not so agreeable to the analogie which is betweene the parts of this text
from this analogy argue thus

as christ the righteous who was without sinne was made sinne that is to say a sinner for us or if you will a sacrifice for sinne in our behalfe so wee who are sinners in our selves are made the righteousnesse of god in him that is righteous in christ by his righteousnesse but christ who was and is most just was made a sinner or a sacrifice of sinne for us by imputation of our sinnes unto him therefore wee who are sinners in our selves are made righteous before god by imputation of christs righteousnesse unto us which is therefore called gods righteousnesse because it is the righteousnesse of him who is god


against both the premisses the papists cavill diversely
doctor

bishop writing against master perkins shutteth his eyes against the truth saying that ther is not in this text any similitude implyed between christs being made sin and our being made just so denyeth the proposition as containing this comparison that we are so made the righteousnesse of god in christ as he was made sinne for us
but this analogy is acknowledged by their saint anselme of canterbury writing upon this text whom when master perkins

alleaged as expounding these words

and recited his exposition all bishops answere is that anselme shall bee answered when the place is quoted when as master perkins not only quoteth him as expounding the place

but also citeth his words
he is made sinne as we are made justice not ours but gods not in us but in him as hee is made sinne not his owne but ours not in himself but in us which words hee borrowed from saint augustine who saith

ipse ergo peccatum ut ns justitia nec nostra sed dei nec in nobis sed in ipso sicut ipse peccatum non suum sed nostrum nec in se sed in nobis both of them plainely expressing this analogy that christ was sinne as wee are righteousnesse not ours but gods no in our selves

but in him even as hee was made sinne not his but ours nor in himselfe but in us which analogy being granted as it cannot bee denyed

doth invincibly prove that as christ was made sinne by imputation of our sinne so wee are justified not by any righteousnesse of ours but by imputation of gods righteousnesse that is of christ who is god and that not in us but in him
and so hierome also expoundeth this place christ being offered for our sinnes received the name of sinne that wee might bee made the justice of god in him not our owne nor in our selves
and sedulius that we might be made the righteousnesse of god not ours nor in our selves but in him that is in christ as the members in the head and augustine againe all

that are justified by christ are just not in themselves but in him


vi secondly they cavill at our exposition of those words both in the proposition and assumption him who knew no sinne hee made sinne that is a sinner for us for first bellarmine

though our sinnes saith hee were imputed unto christ and his satisfaction to us yet neither would it follow that he was thereby made a sinner nor wee righteous
for our sinnes are imputed to him not as though he had committed them or could be held unjust but they are onely imputed to him in respect of the due debt of satisfying which hee willingly undertooke for which hee deserveth not to bee called a sinner but righteous for hee that satisfieth for another is most just
so therefore his righteousnesse is also imputed to us quoad satisfactionem so farre sorth as it is a satisfaction which hee performed for us
but not therefore can wee bee held just that is cleane and without spot if the spots and defilements of sinne bee truly inherent in us

answ
how could our sinnes bee imputed unto christ and hee not bee counted a sinner and how could his satisfaction whereby hee fully satisfied both the commandement by obeying and the penalty by suffering bee imputed unto us and wee not reputed righteous for by imputation as our sinnes were made his so his righteousnesse was made ours
and as for and by our sinnes hee was condemned as if hee had beene a debtour that is a sinner because as our surety hee voluntarily undertooke our debt so by and for his satisfaction which hee performed for us and which the lord accepteth in our behalfe as if we had performed the same in our owne persons wee are justified
and yet though our sinnes being imputed to him he was reputed and as it were made a sinner and though his righteousnesse being imputed to us wee are made righteous in him yet this hindreth not but that hee in himselfe was just and wee in our selves sinners
yea this argueth

that hee in himselfe was just and we in our selves sinners


vii
now that christ was made a sinner for us that is was condemned and crucified as if hee had beene a sinner the greeke expositours with one consent doe teach
chrysostome

him that knew no sin saith the apostle him who was righteousnesse it selfe he made sin that is he suffer'd him to be condemn'd as a sinner and to dye as one accursed and againe more plainely for

him that was righteous saith the

apostle he made a sinner that those which bee sinners he might make righteous
but saith he the apostle saith more him he made sinne and us hee made righteous
the like have

decumenius his sonne being righteousnesse and holinesse he made sinne that is hee suffered him to bee crucified as a sinner and as a guilty person and againe he made sinne that is to bee condemned

as a sinner and elsewhere

very plainely for now the father sent him making him sinne for christ was very much a sinner as having upon him the sinnes the whole world and ade them his that christ was a sinner here saith he him that knew no sinne made sinne for us that were in very deed sinne
and also theophylact his sonne who knew not sinne that is who himselfe was righteousnesse he made to dye for us as if he had beene a sinner and malefactor
for

cursed saith he is he who hangeth on a tree and hee was

numbred among the transgressours
theodoret likewise being free from sinne he did undergoe the death of sinners that hee might take away the sinne of men and being called that which we are that is a sinner he made us that which he was that is righteous to the like purpose

augustine interpreting those words of psalme
vers
according to the translation of the septuagints and the vulgar latine verba delictorum meorum the words of my sinnes of what sinnes saith he of whom it is said that he did no sinne neither was any guile found in his mouth how then doth he say of my sinnes but that hee prayeth for our sinnes and our sinnes he hath made his owne sinnes that his righteousnesse he might make our righteousnesse

hierome upon the same words verb delictorum meor quia nostra peccta sua reputat he saith the words of my sinne because our sinnes hee reputeth to bee his owne and againe on those words psalm


because mine iniquity for he was made subject to the curse that he might deliver us from the curse of the law so he professeth himselfe a sinner who bare our sinnes and on these words cogitab pro pecca meo christs sinnes are the sinnes of mankinde peccata christi humani delicta sunt generis

viii
thirdly bishop and other papists commonly by sinne in this place understand a sacrifice for sinne according to the interpretation of some of the ancient acknowledged by oecumenis in which sense not onely the word ascham is often used as levi






numb

but also chattath exod

levit



levit








ezek




hos

they

eate the sinne of my people

answere
this exposition maketh wholly for us for if god did make christ a sacrifice for sinne he imputed our sinnes unto him or as the prophet esay speaketh he laid

on him the iniquity of us all esai

neither can it bee conceived how he should be made a sacrifice for our sinne unlesse our sinne were imputed unto him
in sacrifices for sinne all which were types of christ his sacrifice the manner was that the party who offered the sacrifice for sinne should

lay his hand

upon the head of the sacrifice the meaning of which ceremony is fully explained
lev

where aaron is required in the name of all the congregation to lay his hands upon the head of the which the hebrews call azazel the greekes undefined span alphabet the latines emissarium and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of israel and all their transgressions in all their sins putting them upon the head of the the goate shall beare upon him all their iniquities
so it is said of our saviour christ

that when his soule shall be made an offering for sinne the lord would lay upon him the iniquities of us all and that he should

beare our sinnes
and as our sinnes are imputed to him so his sufferings are imputed to us and accepted for us and in our behalfe as a full satisfaction and propitiation for our sinnes ephes


ioh

which is also said

of those sacrifices which were but types and figures of his sacrifice levit


and whereas bellarmine saith that we cannot by christs satisfaction imputed to us bee accounted just that is saith he cleane and without spot if the spots and defilements of sinne be truely inherent in us answere if none bee justified in whom remaine any spots of sinne then no mortall man is justified
but as christ was reputed a sinner and was punished as a sinner because our sinne that is our debt which hee as our surety undertooke was imputed to him though in him was no spot of sinne even so we are by christs satisfaction imputed to us reputed and rewarded as just and that by such a justice in which as chrysostome saith there is no spot or blemish and is therefore called gods righteousnesse though in us doe remaine some spots and blemishes of sinne
for here it is said not that wee are made righteous but righteousnesse yea gods righteousnesse and that not in our selves but in him
for that is gods righteousnesse when we are not justified by workes that is by righteousnesse inherent seeing it is necessary that no spot bee found as

chrysostome saith
the like have oecumenius and theophylact
hee did not say that wee might be made righteous saith oecumenius but righteousnesse it selfe which is more and the righteousnesse of god
now gods righteousnesse is to bee justified not by workes undefined span alphabet but by indulgence in him and by him


ix bellarmine having rejected our exposition which is indeed

the exposition of the fathers as hath been shewed he saith it may be expounded three waies first that by the righteousnesse of god in this place we understand the divine justice which is in christ which wee willingly embrace as a confession of that truth which we professe
for by these words he must understand either the essentiall and uncreated justice of the deitie in christ or the righteousnesse of our mediator the

man christ which notwithstanding is called the righteousnesse of god because it is the righteousnesse of that person who is god which righteousnesse saith he we are said to be not in our selves but in him because he is our head or as sedulius before expounded those words in him quasi membra in capite as members in the head
not that either we are formally just saith bellarmine by christs righteousnesse or christ formally a

siner by our iniquitie but because we are his members
for there is such a communion betweene the head and the members that the righteousnesse of the head is imputed to the members and the sinne of the members to the hed as appeareth also by the places alleaged by bellarmine esay

posuit in iniquitatem omnium nostûm

he laid upon him that is hee imputed unto him the iniquity of us all and psal
christ himselfe saith farre from my health are the words

delictorum meorum of mine offences
here therfore the reader is to observe a double confession which the evidence of truth hath wrung from bellarmine
for as in the next precedent section hee confessed the satisfaction of christ to bee imputed to us so here hee acknowledgeth that wee are the righteousnesse of god which is in christ as being the members of that body whereof hee is the head and consequently partakers of that righteousnesse which is in him which therefore hee calleth divine or gods righteousnesse because the person whose righteousnesse it is is god



his second exposition is that by the righteousnesse of god is understood righteousnesse inherent in us which is called gods because it is given us of god
but this exposition cannot stand because the righteousnesse of godof which the apostle speaketh is neither ours but gods nor in us in christ as the fathers have testified
but inherent righteousnesse but though bestowed of god as all other good things which we have received from god is ours and not inherent in christ but in ourselves for as the parts of inherent righteousnesse or sanctification though given of god are said to bee ours

as our faith our hope our charity so the whole righteousnesse which is inherent in us or sanctification is called

ours as have shewed heretofore
neither are wee in this place called righteousnesse in respect of righteonsnesse inherent no more then christ is called sinne in respect of any inherent sinnefulnesse
neither are wee by gods righteousnesse said to bee righteous in our selves but in christ
neither doth saint chrisostome whom hee citeth understand this place of righteousnesse inherent as though such a perfect righteousnesse inherent were given by christ in this life as that in the justified no spot of sinne were left as bellarmine dreameth for the contrary is rather to bee gathered from the words of chrisostome
for it is gods righteousnesse saith hee when wee are justified not of workes that is not by righteousnesse inherent and why so because in that righteousnesse by which wee are justified there may no spot bee found noting as understand him that in our workes and in our inherent righteousnesse spots are to bee fouud whereas that justice in respect whereof wee are said to bee the righteousnesse of god in christ is without spot


xi
his third exposition that by righteousnesse of god is meant inherent righteousnesse which is so called because it is the image of gods righteousnesse
for as christ by a trope is called sinne because hee tooke the similitude of sinnefull flesh that hee might becometa sacrifice for sinne so wee by a trope are called gods righteousnesse because our righteousnesse inherent is

like the justice of god
and hereupon he inferreth that as christ truely and not imputatively tooke the likenesse of sinful flesh and truely and not imputatively was made a sacrifice for sinne so we not imputatively but truly are made righteous in our justification by righteousnesse inherent
answere in this discourse nothing is sound nothing almost worth the answering
for first in the scriptures there is an antithesis

betwixt our righteousnesse and gods righteousnesse in the question of justification but our righteousnesse is that which is inherent gods righteousnesse is that which is out of us in christ
secondly by inherent righteousnesse we are righteous in our selves but by the righteousnesse of god wee are righteous not in our selves but in christ
thirdly if by a trope wee are said to be righteousnesse as christ by a trope was said to be sinne undoubtedly it is to bee understood of the same trope which is a metonymy the abstract being put for the concrete
neither is there the like trope of christ being called sinne and of us being called the righteousnesse of god in him if by sinne in this place be meant a sacrifice for sinne
fourthly neither is it true either that christ in this place is called sinne because he tooke upon him the similitude of sinfull flesh as though the apostle compared our justification whereby we become righteous to christs incarnation wherein he tooke upon him our nature and not to his condemnation wherein he tooke upon him our sinne or that wee are called the righteousnesse of god in christ because we have some likenesse of his justice neither would it follow from hence that wee in our slves are just unlesse it should follow also which were blasphemous to averre that christ in himselfe was a sinner
for so are we made righteous as he was made sinne
fifthly neither is that true that christ was not made a sacrifice by imputation
for when he was made a sacrifice for us our sinne was laid upon him and imputed to him as hath beene said that his righteousnesse in like manner might be imputed to us

cap ii
containing eight other proofes that wee are justified by impuation of christs righteousnesse


my sixth proofe shall bee out of rom

as by

the first adams disobedience which wee call his fall we were made sinners that is guilty of sinne and obnoxious to death and damnation so by the obedience of the second adam we are made just or justified that is acquitted from our sinne and condemnation and accepted in christ as righteous unto life

but wee were made sinners by imputation of adams disobedience therefore by imputation of christ obedience we are justified

the proposition is the apostles
the assumption is in divers places confessed by

bellarmine as have shewed

heretofore though sometimes to serve his present turne he doe deny it
but it is easily proved for if both the guilt of adams sinne be communicated unto us and also the punishment thereof be inflicted upon us which is both our originall corruption and death it selfe besides many other calamityes then is it to be presupposed that the sin it selfe is imputed to us
for if the sin it selfe had not been imputed then as bellarmine himselfe somewhere argues

neither the guilt nor the corruption had belong'd unto us
again things that are transient when they are once past and gone cannot bee communicated otherwise than by imputation
that transgression of adam as all other actions was transient and therefore if it be demanded how it being so long past and gone can bee communicated to us bellarmine truly answeareth it is communicated unto us by generation eo modo quo communicari potest id quod transiit nimirm per imputationem in that manner according to which that may be communicated which is transient and gone to wit by imputation
if it be objected which was bellarmies prime argument for inherent righteousnesse that through the disobedience of the first adam wee were made sinners by inherent unjustice and therefore by the like reason through the obedience of the second adam wee are made just by righteousnesse inherent
answere that from christ we have both

justification and sanctification the former answering to the guilt of adams transgression imputed the latter answerable to the originall corruption by generation derived but though wee have them both from christ yet not after one manner

the former wee have by imputation the latter by infusion
but of this place have spoken heretofore at large


ii
our seventh argument
whosoever is a sinner in himselfe and so continueth whiles he remaineth in this life cannot bee justified otherwise than by imputation
this take to bee a most certaine and undeniable truth

but every many whatsoever christ onely excepted is in himselfe a sinner and so continueth whiles hee remaineth in this life therefore no man whatsoever can othervise bee justified but by imputation

or thus the justification of a sinner is imputative for to a sinner the lord when hee justifieth him imputing not sinne imputeth righteousnesse without workes rom


the justification of

every christian is the justification of a sinner and so is called of all writers boh old and new both protestants and papists

therefore the justification of every christian is imputative

the assumption of the former syllogisme is denyed by the papists but against the testimony of their owne conscience and against the common experience of all men in all times and places
but this prove it briefly
all that sometimes doe sinne or have sinne abiding in them are sinners all men sometimes do sinne and have sinne remaining in them therefore all men are sinners the assumption is proved by iames the just and by the holy beloved apostle including themselves in many

things wee offend all of us and if wee say wee have no sinne

wee deceive our selves and there is no truth in us
but that all mortall men are sinners have sufficiently proved before


vnlesse therefore the papists will say they are no sinners and that in them there is no sinne which if they doe say wee may bee bold to tell

them that there is no truth in them they must confesse justification by imputation of christs righteousnesse


iii
our eigth argument to whom faith is imputed unto

righteousnesse without workes hee is not justified by workes that is by righteousnesse inherent but by imputation of christs righteousnesse

to abraham and all the faithfull faith is imputed unto righteousnesse without workes therefore they are not justified by workes but by imputation of christs righteousnesse

the former part of the proposition is proved by opposition of faith to workes in the question of justifiction and by the testimony of the the apostle rom

the latter part is proved by the former for if not by inherent righteousnesse then by imputed and if by faith and yet not by inherent righteousnesse then not by faith in respect it selfe as it is an habit inherent in us but in respect of the object which it apprehendeth
of which that is verified properly which by

a trope viz a metonimy is ascribed to faith namely that it justifieth and saveth that by it wee have remission of sinne and the inheritance that is christ received by faith doth justifie and save

the assumption in expesse termes is delivered rom




here bellarmine confesseth that faith indeed is imputed unto righteousnesse and that is our righteousnesse which confession doth not well agree with his assertions elsewhere that faith doth but dispose unto justification and that our formall righteousnesse is our charity that faith is an habit of the vnderstanding but justice is an habit of the will but our glosse hee doth not allow when wee say by faith that is by christs righteousnesse apprehended by faith because it is repugnant to the apostle for two causes
for first hee doth not say christs righteousnesse but faith is imputed
now faith is not christs righteousnesse but ours by gods gift
which notwithstanding is the maine doctrine of the gospell

revealing the righteousnesse of god that is of christ who is god from faith to faith the righteousnesse

of god by faith that is which is apprehended by faith
for faith it selfe is not the righteousnesse of god which doth justifie or save us but the instrument to receive gods righteousnesse and therefore doth not justifie or save properly but relatively in respect of the object which it doth receive that is to say the righteousnesse of christ which doth justifie and save those which receive it by faith and therefore when it is said in the gospell more than once thy faith hath saved thee the meaning is that christ received by faith hath saved those which did beleeve in him act

it is said that faith in christ had cured the lame man but it is thus to be understood that the name of christ by faith in his name did cure him
for we are justified and saved by a perfect righteousnes which is of infinite value and merit which is not faith nor any other grace or graces inherent but onely the righteousnesse of christ
and yet because by faith wee are united to christ and by it are made partakers of his benefits therefore all the benefits which wee receive from christ are attributed to faith as elsewhere have shewed to faith metonimically but properly to christ himself
his second reason because the word imputare in this place doth not signifie a bare reputing but a reputing unto which the truth is answer able in the thing it selfe as is plaine by these words

ei qui operatur merces imputatur for it is certaine that to him that worketh not onely in opinion and conceipt but truely and indeed the reward is due
answ
this reason doth not prove our glosse to bee repugnant to the apostle unlesse he imagine that wee hold the imputation of christs righteousnesse to a beleever to bee not reall but imaginary
and then by the same reason let him say that the imputation of our sinnes to christ for which he really suffered and the imputation of adams transgression to his posterity for which they are really punished was but imaginary
howbeit there is a difference in the manner of imputing a reward to him that worketh and of righteousnesse to him that beleeveth for that is ex debito this ex gratia


iv
our ninth argument hee that is justified not by his owne

righteousnesse but by the righteousnesse of another is justified by righteousnesse imputed
but all the faithfull are justified not by their owne righteousnesse phil


rom

but by the righteousnesse of another this was fully proved and maintained in the whole third controversie for that which is but one mans righteousnesse cannot be every faithfull mans owne by inherencie but onely by imputation
the righteousnesse by which wee are justified is but the righteousnesse of one rom



our tenth argument
there is the same matter whereby infants are justified and others
but infants are not justified by righteousnesse inherent for neither have they habituall righteousnesse which consisteth in the habits of faith hope and charity of which they are not capable whiles they want the use of reason nor actuall as all confesse but by the righteousnesse of christ and that imputed
and therefore berd

saith they want no merits because they have the merits of christ


vi
our eleventh argument
as abraham was justified so are wee rom


abraham was justified by imputation rom


and not by inherent righteousnesse though hee did excell therein therefore wee are justified by imputation and not by inherent righteousnesse


vii
our twelfth argument to those that are justified by faith righteousnesse in their justification is imputed without workes that is without respect of righteousnesse inhernt rom


all the faithfull are justified by faith esai

rom

gal


therefore to all the faithfull in their justification righteousnesse is imputed without respect of inherent righteousnesse


viii
our thirteenth argument whose sinnes are remitted by imputation of christs satisfaction unto them they are justified by imputation for to be absolved from sinne is to be justified act


where to have remission of sinne is to bee justified from sinne
so rom

where the apostle sheweth that whose iniquities are forgiven whoe sinnes are covered to whom the lord imputeth not sinne to them hee imputeth righteousnesse without workes where the apostle saith

bellarmine ex non imputatione peccatorum colligit imputationem justitiae from the not imputing of sinne hee gathereth the imputation of righteousnesse them he justifieth them he maketh blessed
so luk

when our saviour would signifie that the lord had head the prayer of the publican who had prayed for the remission of his sinne hee saith he went home justified
but the sinnes of the faithfull are remitted by imputation of christs satisfaction to them
this the papists themselves cannot deny
or if they did the whole doctrine of the gospell would confute them which teacheth that christ dyed for

our sinnes that hee hath redeemed us from all our iniquities that hee gave himselfe undefined span alphabet a full price of ransome for us tim


that hee gave himself for us an offering and sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor ephes


that in him god is well pleased and reconciled unto us forgiving our sinnes cor

that hee is the propitiation for our sinnes iohn

that hee bare our iniquities esai

that in his own body hee bare our sinnes upon the tree pet


that by him wee have redemption

that is remission of sinnes that we are justified by his bloud rom

and by his obedience verse
that god is just

in justifying a beleeving sinner and therefore forgiveth no sinne for which his justice is not satisfied
and his justice cannot be satisfied for our sinnes being an infinite offence as bellarmine himselfe confesseth but by a price or satisfaction of infinit valew which can be no other but the perfect and satisfaction of christ which the lord accepteth in behalfe of all those that beleeve in him which is nothing else but to impute it to them for if god should not accept of christs satisfaction in the behalfe of those that beleeve then in vaine had christ dyed or satisfied for us
therefore the faithfull are justified by imputation


ix hereunto the papists have nothing to oppose but their owne erroneous assertion which is hereby confuted that remission of sinne is an utter abolition extinction deletion of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse

but as in the law two things are to bee considered the precept it selfe and the sanction thereof denouncing punishment to the transgressout so in sinne there are two things to be considered the undefined span alphabet it selfe which is the transgression of the precept and the guilt which bindeth over the sinner to punishment
the undefined span alphabet is twofold for it is partly transient which is the sinfull act or transgression it selfe and partly immanent in the soule of the offendor which is that macula or labes the blemish spot or pollution which the act doth leave behind it in respect whereof as bellarmine teacheth the transgressour after the act is gone remaineth formally a sinner
the guilt also is twofold for it is either reatus culpae the guilt of offence or of offending god and reatus paenae which is the binding over of the sinner unto punishment
now god doth take away the sinnes of the faithfull both in respect of the fault and also of the guilt of punishment but not after one manner
he taketh away the guilt by remission of sinne for in regard of the guilt our sinnes are debts which debts god doth forgive when hee remitteth the punishment and taketh away the guilt which did bind us over to punishment by imputation of christs sufferings unto us who as our surety did pay our debts for us
and because our saviour fully satisfied our debt therefore our sinnes in respect of the guilt of death are in our justification wholly taken away and in that respect there is an utter deletion of them as there useth to be of debts out of debt bookes when they are satisfied
but when the lord doth justifie a man he doth impute unto him not onely the suffering of christ to free him a paena

reatu paenae but also his obedience that he may be constituted righteous and so freed also a culp reatu
for as touching the fault whether you meane the sinfull act which is transient or the sinfull blemish remaining in the soule which is a vicious disposition and pronenesse to sinne left as the remainder of originall sinne and increased by our owne actuall transgressions as it is a fault and the offence of god bringging with it reatum culpae to a beleever and is not imputed to whom christs obedience is imputed but covered with the robe of chriss righteousnesse by imputation wherof he is not only freed from the guilt both of the punishment and of the fault but also accepted as righteous in christ but as the macul is an habituall sinne or sinfull disposition polluting the soule as a remainder of originall sinne increased by our actuall transgressions it is not wholly abolish'd in this life and much lesse at once but it is mortified by degrees in those that repent of their sinnes who day by day

are renewed in the innerman
as for those places which bellarmine alleageth to prove remission of sinne to be the totall abolition of sinne
have fully answered heretofore

in the second question of the first controversie shewing that divers of them are to be understood in respect of the guilt which in remission is totally abolished
the other which are to bee expounded of the corruption are understood of the cleansing and purging of our soules from them either begunne in this life or finished at the end of this life
for the death of the body bringeth with it in the children of god the death and utter extinction of sinne
and therefore death which was brought in as a punishment of sinne becommeth a remedy to extinguish sinne
for whiles we live in the mortall body sinne liveth in us but when the body dyeth sinne is extinguished

cap iii
containing our two last arguments


ovr foureteenth argument
if redemption reconciliation

and adoption be imputative then justification also is by imputation
for have shewed heretofore that these three in substance differ not from justification for as all these three benefits are comprised under justification so in them the whole nature of justification doth consist
for what is it to be redeemed and reconciled but to have our sins

remitted or not

imputed by the imputation of christs sufferings which is the first part of justification and what is it to be adopted but to bee accepted in the beloved as righteous and as an heire of eternall life by imputation of christs obedience which is the second part of justification
but those three benefits are imputative all of them wrought by the not imputing of sinne which had made us the of sinne and satan enemies to god and children of the devill and by the imputation of christs merits whereby of the slaves of sinne and satan wee are made gods

servants of enemies his favourites of the children of the devill the sonnes of god


ii
our fifteenth argument out of psalm

and rom
if

the holy ghost describe justification to bee the forgiving of iniquities the covering of sinne the not imputing of sinne to the sinner the imputing of righteousnesse not to him that worketh but to him that beleeveth in christ or imputing of righteousnesse without workes then justification standeth not in deletion of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse but in imputation of christs righteousnesse by which the sinner is both freed from his sinne and also accepted as righteous

but the holy ghost doth so describe justification rom

psalm



to both parts

bellarmine doth answere
the assumption hee first denieth and then cavills with it
for first whereas calvin as he saith demandeth whether this bee a full definition of justification or but halfe he likewise demandeth when either the saith blessed is the

man that feareth the lord and blessed are they who are upright in the way or when our saviour saith blessed are the poore in spirit

blessed are the meeke whether each of these bee a perfect definition
for if it be where is then remission of sinne secondly he saith that paul alleageth this testimny

out of the psalme not that hee might thereby define fully justification but onely to prove that true justification is the gift of god and not gotten by our owne strength
and that hee fitly proveth from thence that david calleth him blessed whose sinnes god remitteth that is wh by the gift ad grace of god is justified


iii
to the former reply that there is not the like reason betweene

these places cited by us and those alleaged by him
for those containe but certaine notes and markes of blessednesse though the papists absurdly make eight beatitudes of the eight notes of one and the same blessednesse matth

but here the apostle out of psalm

sheweth that blessednesse it selfe whereby as appeareth by the former verse he meaneth justification which is the onely viae because by it we are intitled to the eternall happinesse which is beatitudo patriae all other

undefined span alphabet being but notes and signes of this is so defined or described
for somuch those words import david doth describe the blessednesse as our translation fitly rendreth the word undefined span alphabet in this place

the second is a meere depravation of the apostles meaning and intenion which was not to prove that justification is the gift of god which he had already taught to be a gracious action of god freely justifying by his grace those that beleeve in christ but by a new supply of arguments to prove the same question which in the former chapters hee had disputed concluding that a man is justified by faith and not by workes which question here hee proveth by the example of abraham and by the testimony of david
the argument drawne from abrahms example is an excellent proofe which chrysostome well observed as cardinall

tlet doth acknowledge
for abraham had both faith and workes and yet he was justified not by his workes but by his faith
if abraham had had no workes or not such notable workes it might have beene said that he was justified by faith without workes because he wanted workes
but seeing he abounded with store of excellent works and yet was not justified by them but onely by faith this is an invincible argument to prove that a man is justified by faith and not by workes
for abraham though hee had works yet was justified by faith without workes
likewise david describeth or if you will declareth the blessednesse of the man that is that a man is blessed that is to say justified to whom the lord imputeth righteousnesse without workes


iv
this was his denyall of the assumption
but now he cavilleth

that it may bee that in these words is contained the full definition of justification implicitè
for there cannot be remission of sinne in bellarmines sense that is deletion of sinne unlesse righteousnesse be infsed as darkenesse is not driven away unlesse light come in place
and this saith he the apostle manifestly sheweth when he saith david explaineth the blessednesse of a man to whom the lord imputeth righteousnesse without workes blssed are they whose sinnes are forgiven
vbi saith bellarmine ex non imputatione peccatorum colligit imputationem justitiae where the

apostle from the not imputing of sin gathereth the imputing of justice which is very true and proveth that here is a full definition of justification containing these two parts the not imputing of sinne to the beleever and imputing of righteousnesse or accepting of him as righteous
but where is either the popish deletion of sinne or infusion of righteousnesse unlesse as they have turned remission into deletion so also imputation bee converted into infusion



to the proposition also bellarmine answereth in part and

first to the word covering that although to cover and not to impute sinnes is not if you respect the force of the word to abolish or to extinguish sinne yet if they be referred to god the sense importeth so much
for nothing can bee bid from god unlesse it bee tterly taken away for all things are naked and open before his eyes
reply nothing can bee hid from god which hee would not have hid
but if it please god to cover our sinnes that hee will not behold them psalm


or to hide his face from them psal
to cast them behinde his backe esai

not to marke what is done amisse psalm


then hee is said not to see them because he taketh no notice of them but passeth by them mic

in which sense charity is said to cover sinnes prov



vi
to the word not imputing he saith that god cannot but impute

sinne to him that remaneth a sinner neither can hee repute him righteous unlesse he be made righteous therefore he not imputing of sinne draweth with it veram peccati remissionem that is the extinction of sinne and infusion of righteousnesse
reply he should have said as he said before the not imputing of sinne draweth with it imputing of righteousnesse or the acceptation of a man as righteous both which alwayes goe together because both are wrought together by imputation of christs righteousnesse whereas therefore hee saith that god cannot but impute sinne where sinne still remaineth it is true of unbeleevers and impenitent sinners who are out of christ but for them that bee in christ that is to say beleeving and repentant sinners for whose sinnes christ hath fully satisfied and whom though in themselves sinners hee hath accepted as righteous in christ and for whom our saviour maketh intercession that their sinnes may not be imputed to them hee cannot truly be said to impute sinne unto them
it is true also that the lord reputeth none righteous but such as he maketh righteous both by imputation of christs righteousnesse and also by regeneration by imputation perfectly and at once by regeneration in part and by degrs they being not onely spirit but flesh also in regard whereof though they be righteous in christ yet in themselves they are sinners by reason of sinne remaining in them though in some measure mortified and not at all imputed
so that a regenerate man in divers respects is both a righteous man and a sinner righteous not onely in christ by imputation of his perfect righteousnesse but also in himselfe by inherent righteousnesse begun in him from which as is from the better part hath his denomination in the scriptures a sinner also in himselfe both in respect of habituall sinnes remaining in him as the remnants of originall

sinne and also in respect of actuall transgressions both of commission and of omission whereinto hee doth dayly fall


vii
and whereas he saith that these phrases almost alwaies

goe together and to that purpose citeth nehem


psal

and so psal

answere that deletion of sinne covering of sinne forgiving of sinne and the not imputing of it are used as synonima that is as words of the same signification and that in all such places deletion of sin doth signifie the blotting of them our of gods remembrance which is as it were his record or debt booke
out of which when god forgiveth sinnes he blotteth or wipeth them out
thus to forgive sins is not to remember them esai

even am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine owne sake and wil not remember thy sinnes ier

will forgive their iniquity and will remember their sinne no more
and to remember them is not to forgive them
ps

let the iniquity of his fathers be remembred with the lord and let not the sinne of his mother bee blotted out namely of remembrance that is let it not bee forgotten so neh

cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before thee
ps

hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities and to the same purpose psal

forgiving and covering are used in the same fence
thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered all thei sinne and so psal


forgiving covering not imputing
deletion therefore of sinnes according to the scriptures is the blotting of them out of the booke of gods remembrance
in this sense many things are said deleri to bee blotted out or wiped away by oblivion whose memory is wiped out as it is said of the amalekites exod

and according to the vulgar latine translation deut

nulla delebit oblivio esth

eccl

ierem






so that non imputare is all one with ignoscere tim


so iob

according to the vulgar latine
cbro

ezek



viii
now if not to impute sinne bee as bellarmine sith to

expell sinne by infusion of righteousnesse for according to his concelt infusion of righteousnesse is not a consequent of the expulsion of sinne as here for a poore evasion he saith but expulsion of sinne is a consequent of infusion of righteousnesse for according to his assertion by infusion of righteousnesse sinne is expelled as by accession of light and heat cold and darkenesse is expelled say if not to impute sinne bee to expell sinne by infusion of justice then by the rule of contraries which is contrariorum contraria sunt consequentia to impute sinne shall bee to expell righteousnesse by infusion of sinne as it was well objected by chemnitius
to him bellarmine objecteth want of logicke for calling those contraria which are contradicentia
where by bellarmines logick adversa onely are contraria whereof notwithstanding there are foure sorts for if contraries bee such opposits as are opposed one to one onely then besides adversa as tully termeth those which aristotle calleth undefined span alphabet there are three other sorts of contraries that is to say relata which aristotle calleth undefined span alphabet privantia undefined span alphabet which are opposed undefined span alphabet as

privation and habit contradicentia undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet which are opposed undefined span alphabet as affirmation and negation which tully calleth velde contraria
thus if bellarmines logick be good there are no opposits but contraries nor any contraries but adversa when it is acknowledged by better logicians than himselfe that of all opposites the most contrary are those which are opposed as affirmation and negation which are called contradicentia as imputare non imputare which are so immediately opposed as the one of them is alwayes true quidlibet affirmare negare verum but cannot both bee true together for that implyeth a contradiction
and therefore chemnitius objection standeth still in force


ix againe if the holy ghost in this place had meant by remission

of sinne the deletion or abolition of it hee would not have called it remitting covering or hiding or not imputing of it
for nothing is either remitted covered or not imputed but that which is
and things are hid not that they should not bee but that they should not bee seene
tecta ergo peccata quare dixit saith augustine ut non viderentur
as a prudent man hideth his knowledge prov

and an hypocrite his sinne we know this saith bellarmine but withall we know that somethings are covered that they may bee preserved and some things that they may be abolished
as wounds are covered with a plaister the most ordinary end and perpetuall consequent of hiding any thing hee leaveth out which is that it may not be seene and so god hideth our sinnes when hee hideth his face from them



but for our learning bellarmine will shew us the expositions

of the fathers that wee may know how farre we swarve from the meaning of the ancient and orthodox church
and first hee citeth iustin

martyr who alleadging psal

blessed is the man to whom the lord doth not impute sinne that is saith he that a man undefined span alphabet repenting of his sinnes receiveth from god undefined span alphabet the forgivenesse of his sinne where hee expounderh the not imputing of sinnes to bee the forgivenesse thereof
but saith he not as you deceive your selves and others like you in this point who say that although they be undefined span alphabet that is not those which have sinne but such as the scripture calleth sinners that is to say impenitent sinners so that they know god the lord will not impute sinne unto them though they doe not repent wherein we wholly agree with iustin though the papists doe not who deceive themselves and others whom they perswade though they live in sinne if they observe the outward formality of doing penance which all of them do once a yeare though they neither have faith nor repentance which very few if any of them have they have absolution from their sinne


xi
in the next place he citeth origen

and hierome both which doe make three degrees of the three phrases wherein as they conceive david ascendeth from the lesse to the greater when as notwithstanding it is apparant that if those phrases did signifie divers things the first were the greatest and the middle the least according to the variety

of the words whereby sinne in this place is signified
origen setteth them

downe not as the gifts of god as bellarmine beareth us in hand but as a mans owne merits for because saith hee the beginning of the conversion of the soule is to forsake evill from this hee deserveth which the papists themselves deny to receive remission of sinne
but when hee shall beginne to doe good as it were covering over his former evils with new good is said to cover sinnes
but when he shall come to a perfect man insomuch that from the soule the very roote of all wickednesse is cut off in so much that no footstep of wickednesse can bee found therein which never happeneth in this life for concupiscence which remayneth in all is both a footstep of sinne at the least and the very roote of all iniquity iam

where now the summe of perfect blessednesse is promised then god cannot impute any sinne which was a private and unsound conceit as there are many more of origen from which though we dissent wee cannot justly bee said to swarve from the doctrine of the primitive orthodox church


xii hierome

if yet it be hierome mentioneth three degrees but all of remission of sinne for so hee saith quibus modis remittuntur peccata tribus by what wayes are sinnes remitted by three
they are remitted by baptisme they are covered by charity they are not imputed by martyrdome which assertion also is unsound both because according to this conceipt to no man is sinne not imputed but onely to martyrs and also because by charity hee seemeth to understand not gods love but ours when notwithstanding it is euident though our charity cover other mens sinnes prov

yet our sinnes are to bee covered by the love and mercie of god in christ
howbeit in that which followeth he is moresound and agreeth with us quod tegitur non videtur quod non videtur non imputatur quod non imputatur nec punietur what is covered is not seene what is not seene is not imputed what is not imputed shall not be punished where he plainely sheweth that the covering and not imputing of sinne is the not punishing of it
but this distinction of the words into three degrees is rejected by saint

ambrose who saith that to remit cover and not impute are all of one sense and meaning
indeed hee saith that divers names of sinnes are here mentioned whereby wee may gather the variety of sinnes but the verbes bee of one signification quia cum tegit remittit cum remittit non imputat because when hee covereth he remitteth and when hee remitteth hee doth not impute
and this exposition is most agreeable to that of saint paul who by all these three understandeth one and the same thing which is the imputation of righteousnesse without workes
for it is the manner of the men of god in their psalmes and hymnes recorded in the word of god for their greater comfort as it were by way of exultation to dwell upon those things wherein they rejoyce by expressing the same in divers and sundry ermes whereby the selse same thing is repeated which rhetoricians call undefined span alphabet


xiii
in the last place hee citeth two testimonies against us

which he calleth out of augustines exposition of these words which being intirely cited agreeth wholly with us
for to omit his exposition of these words a little before set downe quorum tecta sunt peccata whose sins are covered that is saith he quorum peccata in oblivione ducta sunt whose sins are brought into oblivion in the place quoted by bellarmine he hath these words
they whose sins are covered he doth not say in whom no sins are found but whose sins are covered
the sins are covered and hid they are abolished or blotted out by oblivion according to his owne former exposition even now alleaged
if god covered sins he would not have an eye to them nor animadvert them if hee would not animadvert them neither would he punish them noluit agnoscere maluit ignoscere he would not take notice of them he would rather pardon them
blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered then follow the words cited by bellarmine
ne sic intelligatis doe not sounderstand what he saith whose sins are covered as though they were there and lived unmortified and unrepented of
for that they bee there still though mortified appeareth both by the words before that they may be found there though covered and by his next words tecta ergo peccata quare dixit ut non viderentur why then did he say that sins are covered not that they be not at all but that they may not be seene
quid enim erat dei videre peccata nisi punire peccata for what is gods seeing of sin but his punishing of sin and so on the other side what is his not seeing or covering of sin but his not punishing or pardoning it afterwards making way for the exposition of verse
he saith that no man is without sin and that no man can boast that he is cleane from sins
and that therefore men if they would have their sinnes cured they must not hide them like the

pharisee who be ing in the temple as it were in statione medici did shew his sound parts and hid his wounds
deus ergo tegat vulnera noli tu let god therefore cover thy wounds do not thou
for if thou being ashamed wilt cover thy wounds the physician will not cure it then follow the words cited by bellarmine in the second place medicus tegat curet emplastro enim tegit
let the physician cover and cure for with a plaister he covereth then followeth under the cover of the physitian the wound is healed under the cover of him that is wounded the wound is concealed
from whom doest thou conceale it from him that knoweth all things
therfore brethren see what he saith

quum tacut because held my peace my bones are waxen old where august
doth not expound these words whose sins are covered but sheweth that if wee would have them healed wee should not cover them but confesse them to our spirituall physician that he covering them with an emplaister may cure them all which we confesse so that he needed not to quote the two gregories to prove that god doth as it were with a plaister cover and cure our sinnes
but withall we would know of bellarmine what this plaister is
is it our inherent righteousnesse as the papists teach or is it not the righteousnesse and satisfaction of christ by whose stripes

we are healed for as shall shew presently out of

iustin martyr whom here to no purpose bellarmine did alleage in the first place nothing could cover

our sinnes but onely the righteousnesse of christ by whom the iniquity of many is hid or covered


xiv
diverse other arguments bellarmine mentioneth as cited out of calvins institutions lib

in answering wherof besides some of those which have produced he spendeth six

whole chapters which

notwithstanding for the most part are not there to be found but seeme at least some of them to have been devised of his own braine and by him framed and fitted to his owne strength that having overcome these counterfeit enemies hee might seeme to have refuted us
but these arguments which have produced are sufficient for the proofe of the point in question and them have defended against his cavils
if any man desire to see the defence of the rest that is to see bellarmines objections devised for us maintained against himselfe he may have recourse to the answere of david paraeus who hath in so many chapters answered bellarmines exceptions lib
de justif
cap


now proceed to the testimonies of the fathers and of other later writers

cap iv
testimonies of writers both old and new proving justification by righteousnesse imputed



beginne as bellarmine did with

iustin martyr
for what other thing saith he could hide or cover our sinnes but the righteousnesse of the sonne of god in whom was it possible that wee sinners and ungodly should bee justified but in the onely sonne of god sweet the iniquity of many should be hid in one just person and that the righteousnesse of one should justifie many sinners



athanasius affirmeth that the fulfilling of the law wrought by the first fruits whereby he meaneth the flesh of christ is imputed to the whole lumpe



gregory nyssene marvell not saith the spouse that uprightnesse hath loved me but that being blacke by reason of my sinne and by my workes drawing neere to darkenesse hee hath made mee beautifull

by his love making an exchange of his beauty with my blacknesse
for having translated the filthinesse of my sinnes unto himselfe hee hath made me partaker of his purity communicating unto me his owne beauty



chrysostome here the apostle sheweth that there is but one righteousnesse and that that of the law is recapitulated or reduced to this of faith
and that he which hath gotten this which is by faith hath also fulfilled that but he that despiseth this he falleth from that together with this and a little after if thou beleevest in christ thou hast fulfilled the law and hast performed much more than the law commanded
for thou hast received a farre greater righteousnesse
for as he had said in the words going before that christ hath justified us by faith undefined span alphabet more amply than we would have been justified by the law
this greater this more ample righteousnesse must needs be understood of christs righteousnesse imputed unto us



ambrose he that confesseth his sinnes to god is justified that is obtaineth remission of sinne which is also testified by iohn ioh

and is verified in david psalm


and in the publican luk

but he that is justified by remission of sinne is also justified by imputation of righteousnesse for as bellarmine confesseth the not imputing of sinne bringeth with it imputation of righteousnesse



hierome to the like purpose then are wee just when wee confesse our selves to bee sinners and our righteousnesse consisteth not in our owne merit but in gods mercy



augustine omnes qui per christum justificati jsti non in se sed in illo
all that are justified by christ are just not in themselves but in him
and thereunto adde the testimonies before

cited out of hierome

augustine

sdulius and

anselmus who all have taught that wee when wee are justified are made righteous not in our selves but in christ

againe

augustine teacheth that our justice in this life doth stand rather in the remission of sinnes than in perfection of vertues
that is as understand him that our chiefe righteousnesse in this life is that of justification and not of sanctification for that is perfect and so is not this by that we are justified before god and intitled unto heaven so are we not by this
here

bellarmine would seeme to acknowledge that remission of sinne concurreth to justification but his constant and perpetuall doctrine is that justification consisteth wholly in the infusion of righteousnesse expelling sinne in so much that remission of sinne and infusion of righteousnesse are not two actions but one which assertion supposed how could augustine say that our righteoufnesse is such in this life that it consisteth rather in the forgivenesse of sinne than in the perfection of vertues seeing vertue infused is the force of justification and expelleth sinne and is all in all and if that assertion of the utter deletion of sin when it is remitted were true most vaine were that boasting of

ambrose who saith gloriabor non quia vacuus peccati sum sed quia mihi remissa sunt peccata

maximus taurinensis when god

doth remit sinne indulgentia facit innocentem by his indulgence he maketh the party innocent


among the latter writers will give the first place to bernard who saith death

by the death of christ is put to flight christi nobis justitia imputatur and the righteousnesse of christ is imputed to us


what could

man doe of himselfe to recover his righteousnsse once lost being the servant of sinne and the bondman of the devill assignata est ei proinde aliena justitia qui caruit suâ therefore nother mans righteousnesse was assigned unto him who wanted his owne



one dyed sor all ut viz satisfactiounius omnibus imputetur that the satisfaction of one might be imputed to all


if he shall say

thy father adam made thee guilty will answere that my brother hath redeemed me why not righteousnesse from another seeing guilt is from another


hee will

not condemne the just who had mercy on a sinner
may call my selfe just sed illius justitiâ but by his righteousnesse and what is that christ the end of the law unto righteousnesse to every one that beleeveth finally who of god the father was made righteousnesse unto us
is not that therefore my righteousnesse which was made righteousnesse unto me


lord

will mention thy righteousnesse onely for that is mine also for thou of god was made righteousnesse to mee should feare that it being but one should not suffice us both it is not a short cloake which is not able according to the prophet to cover two
thy righteousnesse is an everlasting righteousnesse what is longer than eternity thy eternall and large righteousnesse it will cover largely both thee and me and in me truely it covereth a mulitude of sinnes but in thee lord what doth it cover but the treasures of piety and riches of bounty which testimony doth plainely prove against bellarmine that bernard by christs righteousnesse which he saith is made ours doth not meane that righteousnsse which is inheent in us but that which is out of us in christ and the same is evidently proved by those testimonies before

alleaged that we are made the righteousnesse of god in christ not ours but his not in our selves but in him even as christ was made sinne not his but ours not in himselfe but in us


cardinall contarenus

in a treatise of justification which he wrote anno
testifieth that god with his spirit giveth christ unto us and doth freely of his mercie make all christs righteousnesse to bee ours and imputeth it to us who put on christ
that by faith wee doe attaine to a double righteousnesse the one inherent in us by which we begin to bee just and are made partakers of the divine nature and have charity diffused in our hearts the other not inherent but given unto us with christ
meane saith hee the righteousnesse of christ and all his merits both which are in time given together
now saith he forasmuch as have said that by faith we attaine to a twofold righteousnesse the one inherent in us viz charity or that grace by which

we are made partakers of the divine nature the other being the righteousnesse of christ given and imputed to us because wee are ingrafted into christ and have put on christ it remaineth we should inquire on whether of them we ought to rely and to thinke our selves justified before god that is to beheld or esteemed holy and just meane by such a righteousnesse which may beseeme gods children and satisfie the eyes of god ego prorsus existimo

doe utterly thinke that it may be godlily and christianly said that we ought to rely say to rely as upon a sure thing which doth assuredly sustaine us on the righteousnesse of christ given unto us and not on that holinesse and grace which is inherent in us
for this our righteousnesse is but begun and unperfect which cannot safegard us but that in many things we offend and daily doe offend and have need to pray daily that our debts may be forgiven us wherefore in the sight of god

wee cannot for this justice be accounted just and good as it would become the sonnes of god to be good and holy
but the righteousnesse of christ which is given unto us is tru and perfect justice which is altogether pleasing in the eyes of god in which there is nothing which may offend god or which doth not highly please him upon this therefore being certaine and sure we are to rely and for it alone to beleeve that we are justified that is to bee held and pronounced just
this is that pretious treasure of christians who so findeth selleth all he hath that he may buy it
this is that precious pearle which who findeth leaveth all that he may have it
the apostle paul saith esteemed all other things losse that might gaine christ not having mine owne righteousnesse but that which is by the faith of christ and a little after he saith that the more holy any men are so much the more they understand themselves to stand in need of christ and his righteousnesse vouchsafed to them and therefore forsaking themselves rest upon christ alone

albertus

pighius having shewed that all men are sinners and subject to the curse from thence inferreth that most miserable had beene our estate if god had not most mercifully fuccoured us in his son nostrâ justitiâ vacuos ejus involvisset justitia and being void of our owne righteousnesse had inwrapped us in his righteousnesse and a little after

nisi ipse sua impartiretur justitia qui nostra planè destituimur quae nostram iniquitatem injustitiam doth not say the man is blessed who hath not committed sinne nor done iniquity but blessed are they whose iniquities are mercifully forgiven of god whose sinnes he doth cover and hide with his justice
blessed is the man to whom the lord imputeth not sinne which he can scarcely be without or at least never is without and againe in illo in christ therefore wee are justified before god not in ourselves not with our righteousnesse but with his which now is imputed to us having communion with him wanting righteousnesse in our selves we are taught extra nos in illo justitiam quaerere to seeke for righteousnesse out of ourselves in saith he

that our righteousnesse standeth in christs obedience hence it is because wee being incorporated into him it is accepted of god in

our behalfe as if it were ours insomuch that by it selfe we are held just
and even as iacob when not being the first borne but hiding himselfe under the habit of his brother and clothed with his garment which sent forth a fragrant smell obtayned the blessing from his father so we that we may obtaine the blessing of righteousnesse from our heavenly father it behoveth us to lye hid under the pretious purity of our eldest brother to smell sweet with his odour and to have our sinnes covered with his perfection
and finally he saith that if wee speake formally and properly wee are justified neither by faith nor charity but by the onely righteousnesse of god in christ by the onely righteousnesse of christ communicated to us and by the onely mercie of god forgiving our sinnes which saith he have before made evident


conradus clingius

maketh justification to be either imputative which we call justification or active which we call sanctification the righteousnesse of the former being wholly in christ of the latter in us so that he differeth but in termes from us


the auhors of the booke called antididagm


coloniens
say that the righteousnesse of christ imputed to us is the principall and chefe cause of our justification upon which chiefly we ought to rely and trust


to these we may adde the confession of our adversaries who cannot deny but that christ his satisfaction is imputed to all that are justified or shall be saved as have shewed before
ye this is the confession of all christians who professe christ to be our saviour that the lord accepteth the merits of christ that is his obedience and sufferings in their behalfe as if they had performed the same in their owne persons
and what is this but to impute the obedience of christ and his sufferings unto us doth not god accept christs righteousnes for us or did hee not thereby satisfie for us to what end then as bellarmine

well inferreth did christ take upon him our nature to what end and purpose did he humble himselfe to doe and to suffer so great things for us for this confession argue thus
what righteousnesse and obedience of another the lord accepteth for us that hee imputeth to us for righteousnesse for by imputation we meane nothing else

but the righteousnesse and obedience of christ the lord accepteth for us otherwise he could not have been our saviour
therefore the righteousnesse and obedience of christ is imputed to us for righteousnesse

the objections of the papists against imputation



first they cavill at the word and that in divers respects

for first they say it is new
secondly they deride it calliug it justitiam putatitiam an imaginary justice
thirdly they say this assertion that wee are justified by imputation of christs righteousnesse is no where to bee found
to the first concerning novelty answere that the word is used tenne times rom
and in the same sence that wee doe use it for accepting a man as righteous who in himselfe is a sinner verse
or imputing to a man righteousnesse that worketh not vers
or without workes vers
that is without respect of any righteousnesse inherent in him or performed by him besides other places of the scriptures both in the old testament and in the new where the hebrew chashab is read with lamed or the greek undefined span alphabet with a dative of the person whether in the greeke translation of the old testament or in the greeke text of the new

but say they the greeke undefined span alphabet which is a simple verbe and the hebrew chashab doth signifie prare not imputar to thinke esteeme or account not to impute
answer when the hebrew verbe is read with lamed or the greeke with the dative of the person it signifieth properly to impute as in the places even now quoted and is all one with undefined span alphabet which word also is used by the apostle rom

phile

or undefined span alphabet as

varius doth expound it producing this example undefined span alphabet the sinnes of the children of god undefined span alphabet to the fathers that is imputeth or layeth them to their charge and so the vulgar latine translateth the

greeke undefined span alphabet by the latine imputare as rom

or reputare with a dative as rom

or accepta ferre as rom

which are all one even in the opinion of that latine interpeter

neither should this act of imputation seeme strange seeing the practise thereof is usuall among men
for as when the debtour being not able to make payment if the surety shall pay the whole summe or satisfie for the debt the sureties payment or satisfaction is imputed to the debtour and accepted in his behalfe as if himselfe had discharged the debt
even so wee being debtours to god both in respect of the penalty due for our sinnes past and also of obedience which we owe for the time to come and being altogether unable either to satisfie the one or performe the other christ as our surety fatisfieth both these debts for us and his satisfaction is imputed unto us and accepted in our behalfe as if we in our owne persons had discharged our debt


ii
whereas in the second place they deride imputed justice calling it putatitiam as if it were an imaginary righteousnes only which also they say doth both derogate from the glory of god to whom it were more honourable to make a man truely righteous than to repute him righteous who in himselfe is wicked and also detract from the honour of christs spouse who is onely arraied with her husbands righteousnesse as it were a garment being in herselfe deformed
answere first whom the lord doth justifie hee doth indeed and in truth constitute and make them righteous by imputing unto them the righteousnesse of christ no lesse truely and really than either adams sinne was imputed to us or our sinnes to christ for which hee really suffered
secondly whom god justifieth or maketh righteous by imputation them also he sanctifieth or maketh righteous by infusion of a righteousnesse begun in this life and to bee perfected when this mortall life is ended
and further that it is much more for the glory both of gods justice and of his mercie when hee justifieth sinners both to make them pefectly righteous by imputation of christs righteousnesse and also having freed them from hell by the perfect stisfaction of his sonne and entitled them to the kingdome of heaven by his perfect obedience to prepare and to fit them for his owne kingdome by beginning a righteousnesse inherent in them which by degrees groweth towards perfection in this life and shall bee fully perfected so soone as this life is ended rather than to justifie or to speake more properly to sanctifie them onely by a righteousnesse which is unperfect and but begun which in justice can neither satisfie for their sinnes nor merit eternall life
and as for the spouse of christ as it is most honourable for her to stand righteous before god not in her owne unperfect righteousnesse but in the most perfect and absolute righteousnesse of christ the eternal son of god which far surpasseth the righteousnes of al men and angels so it is both profitable to her and honorable to god whiles shee is to continue he warfare and pilgrimage in this world to bee subject to insirmities and imperfections whereby shee being humbled in her selfe is taught to rely upon the power and goodnesse of god

whose

grace is sufficient for her and whose power is seene in her weakenesse especially considering that though her obedience bee unperfect yet it being upright it is not only accepted in christ by whose perfect obedience imputed her wants are covered but also graciously rewarded and also considering that the remainders of sinne are left ad agonem that having maintained a spirituall warfare against them and the other enemies of her salvation and having overcome them she may receive the crowne promised to them which overcome


iii
as touching the third which is bellarmines first objection

in this place that it is no where read that christs righteousnesse is imputed unto us or that wee are justified by christs righteousnesse imputed
answer that as in many other controversies the assertion of neither part is in so many words and syllables expressed in the scriptures so neither in this
for where doe the papists read either in scriptures or fathers that our righteousnesse inherent is the formall cause of our justification before god the contrary whereof in substance is so often read as it is said that wee are not justified by our workes or by our owne righteousnesse nor in our selves nor by a righteousnesse prescribed in the law in which all inherent righteousnesse is fully and perfectly described
but the substance of our assertion is often read as namely first that when god doth justifie a finner hee imputeth righteousnesse unto him without workes that is without respect of any righteousnesse inherent in or performed by himselfe rom

secondly that hee justifieth him not by the parties

owne righteousnesse or by making him righteous in himselfe but by the righteoufnesse of another viz christ in whom hee is made righteous
thirdly that we are justified by the bloud

and by the obedience that is the personall righteousnesse of christ which neither it selfe nor yet the merit thereof without communication wherof no man can be saved is or can be communicated unto us otherwise than by imputation
from whence wee may argue thus

the righteoufneffe whereby wee are justified is imputed for when god doth justifie a man hee imputeth

righteousnesse unto him

by the righteousnesse of christ wee are justified rom



therefore the righteousnesse of christ is imputed unto us
fourthly that as by the disobedience of adam wee were made inners namely by the imputation thereof unto us for neither the guilt nor the corruption nor the punishment which is death had belonged to us if the sinne it selfe had not beene imputed unto us so by the obedience of christ wee are justified which if it were not imputed to us we could by it neither be freed from hell nor entitled to heaven nor made inherently just by it
fifthly that wee are so made the righteousnesse of god in christ as hee was made sinne for us that is by imputation
sixthly and lastly to omit other proofes when the papists doe confesse that christs satisfaction is imputed unto us they confesse as much as wee teach if it bee rightly understood
for his satisfaction for us is either in respect of the penalty of the law to free us from hell or in respect

of the commandement to entitle us to heaven
the penalty hee hath satisfied by his sufferings which is obedientia crucis his obedience of the crosse the commandement by the perfect fulfilling therof which is obedientia legis his obedience of the law
now bellarmine as have heretofore shewed teacheth in his fifth chapter of his second booke that god accepteth in our behalfe the righteousnesse of christ whereby he satisfied for us
and in the tenth chapter that not ou righteousnesse doth satisfie for our sinnes but the righteousnesse of christ which is imputed to us and to that purpose citeth

bernard
for if one faith he dyed for all then all were dead that the satisfaction of that one might bee imputed to all as hee bare the sinnes of all


iv
bellarmine his second and third argument both tend to prove that for the justification of a sinner there is no need of imputation of christs righteousnesse where in mine opinion hee might as well have alleaged that there is no need of a saviour
for if there bee need of a saviour it is to free us from the danger of damna ion and to entitle us to the kingdome of heaven both which benefits are implyed in justification
but how should we who are sinners and consequently by sinne obnoxious to damnation and excluded from heaven bee either acquitted from hell or made heires of heaven for neither by our selves nor by any other meanes in the world can we bee freed from hell or have right to heaven but onely by the death and merits of christ our onely saviour which is so cleare a truth that the papists themselves cannot deny it
but how can wee bee freed from hell by christs sufferings or entitled to heaven by his obedience if the lord doe not accept of his sufferings and obedience in our ehalfe as if we had suffered and done the same in our owne persons if god doe not accept them in the behalfe of the faithfull for whose sake hee did obey and suffr then all that christ did and suffered for us was in vaine and in vaine did he take our nature and our sinnes upon him if the lord doe accept in our behalfe the fufferings and merits of christ then doth he impute them unto us
for by imputation as haue said wee meane nothing else
neither can the sufferings and obedience of christ being transient as have also shewed before bee otherwise communicated unto us but by imputation



but come we to his second argument for if saith he imputation

bee necessary it is chiefly for this cause because a man after remission of sinne remaineth still a sinner his sinne being covered and not abolished
but when sinnes are remitted they are not onely covered but utterly abolished
but here bellarmine grossely mistaketh our assertion as if we held that sins are first forgiven and then after the forgivenesse of sinnes righteousnesse is imputed
but wee hold that by imputation of christs righteousnesse or satisfaction we have remission of sinne and not otherwise and therefore that to remission it selfe imputation is absolutely necessary
for god forgiveth no sinne nor remitteth the guilt of punishment for which his justice is not fully satisfied
but wee are not able our selves to satisfie for our sinnes but by eternall punishment
therefore

it is impossible salva dei justitia that our sinnes should bee forgiven

unlesse christs satisfaction be imputed unto us


vi
and whereas still he harpeth on that string that remission of sinne is the utter deletion or abolition of it to wit by infusion of righteousnesse and that therefore imputation of christs righteousnesse is needlesse answere first that in sinne two things are considered the

guilt and the corruption
that in remission of sinne the guilt is fully taken away by imputation of christs perfect righteousnesse but the corruption or pollution is not taken away by remission but by mortification and that not fully and at once but by degrees
and howsoever these two benefits doe alwayes concurre remission of sinne and mortification of sinne for whosoever are freed from the guilt of sinne are also freed from the dominion of sinne and to whom the lord granteth remission to them hee granteth repentance gods forgiving and mans forgoing or forsaking of sinne going alwayes together notwithstanding they are by no meanes to be confounded
confesse that both of them are wrought by the bloud of christ and by his death but in a divers respect
for by the bloud of christ is meant all that which issued out of his blessed side which was both bloud and water ioh

which saint ioh vers
noteth as a thing most remarkable and accordingly in his first epistle chapter
vers
urgeth it
this is he that came by water and bloud even christ iesus not by water onely but by water and bloud
the bloud of redemption to redeeme us from the guilt of sinne and the water of ablution to purge us from the pollution of sinne
the death also of christ may be considered either in respect of the merit thereof as it is undefined span alphabet a price or ransome apprehended by faith to redeeme us from the guilt of sinne or in respect of the vertue and efficacy as it is a medicine or plaister

applyed by the holy ghost to cure us of the malady of sinne
both christ worketh by his bloud and by his death but the former is done without us and in respect of sinnes past at once as when a debt is fully satisfied the later is wrought in us as when a disease is cured by degrees


vii
secondly if remission of sinne bee an utter deletion or

a totall abolition of sinne then no mans sinne is forgiven in whom any sinne remaineth which is a most desperate doctrine as heretofore

have shewed for where is that mortall man in whom no sinne remaineth if the papists say they have no sinne saint

iohn will tell them that there is no truth in them
thirdly in the scriptures to remit sinne is not to abolish it but to pardon

and to forgive it or not to impute it
and further god is said so to forgive our sinnes as wee forgive the offences of others which wee doe when by charity

we cover them when we do not remember them with any desire or purpose to revenge them when we are reconciled to them that offended us
the difference is that god forgiveth not onely in mercy but in justice also forgiving no sinnes but those for which his justice is fully satisfied
he forgiveth therefore those sinnes for which christ hath satisfied he remitteth the punishment to us which christ hath borne for us he covereth them

but with the robe of christs righteousnesse hee is reconciled unto us but it is christ for whose sake he doth forgive our sinnes
thus therefore argue if remission of sinne bee not the deletion of the sinne it selfe by infusion of righteousnesse but the not imputing or covering of it the taking away of the guilt by imputation of christs satisfaction then we are justified not by infusion but by imputation but the former is true therefore the later

yea but aith bellarmine the scripture by remission of sinne understandeth the utter abolishing of sinne and to that purpose useth all manner of words which could be devised to expresse the utter deletion of sinne to which purpose he alleageth many testimonies all which have answered

heretofore


viii
fourthly if there be a totall deletion of sin in our justification by the infusion of righteousnesse then that righteousnesse which in our justification is infused is perfect for the infusion of righteousnesse which is unperfect cannot cause a totall abolition of sinne
nay the imperfection it selfe is a sinne
but it is absurd to imagine that the righteousnesse which is infused in the first imaginary justification of the papists or as we speake in our first regeneration is perfect seeing in our best estate in this life wee receive but the first fruits of the spirit and in our first regeneration which is as it were our conception wee receive but the seeds as it were of gods graces
and therefore to imagine that in infants newly baptized having not so much as the use of reason there is perfection or full growth of faith hope and charity when actually they neither can beleeve hope or love surpasseth all absurdity
especially when they acknowledge a great difference not onely betweene viatores which are in via that is the faithfull in this life and comprehensores which are in paria that is the saints in heaven but also among viatores themselves whom they distinguish into three degrees incipientes which are as infants proficientes which are as adolescentes and perfecti which are as adulti among whom none are so perfect

but that still something may and ought to bee added their inner man being renewed from day to day cor

untill they come to full pefection which is not to bee attained unto in this life
shall then not onely other viatores be perfect but incipientes also now it is apparant that their justification is incipientium even of infants in baptisme in whom if there be a totall deletion of sinne by infusion of righteousnesse then that righteousnesse which in baptisme is infused is perfect neither can any thing be added to their fath hope and charity
but that there is no perfect inherent righteousnesse in this lie in any meere man whatsoever may thus briefly be proved
in whomsoever is sinne in them is not perfect righteousnesse for perfect righteousnesse and sinne cannot stand together
but in all mortall men there is sinne therefore in no meere or mortall man is perfect righteousnesse inherent

cap vi bellarmines third argument that because the righteousnesse infused

in iustification is perfect refuted




bellarmine his third argument whereby in the second

place hee would prove the imputation of christs righteousnesse to bee needlesse unto justification is because the righteousnesse which in justification is infused is perfect
but his argument is unsufficient and his disputation is ophisticall
vnsufficient for although our righteousnesse for the time to come should be perfect yet for the temission of sinnes past wherein in justification partly consisteth the imputaton of christs satisfaction is absolutely necessary
his disputation is sophisticall wherin he argueth posse ad esse and worse than so for where he ought to prove that the righteousnesse infused in our justification is perfect in all that are justified and so soone as they are justified hee proveth that in some men whom he accounteth perfect it may in some part of their life after thay have been good proficients be perfect
but that is not the question but whether the righteousnesse which in the justification of a sinner is infused which they call their first justification be perfect or not for if it be unperfect and but begun it cannot possibly justifie a sinner before god but for all it the imputation of christs righteousnesse will be most necessary
but let us follow him in his proofe such as it is
inherent righteousnes saith he onsisteth in these three especially faith hope charity if therefore these may be perfect in this life then or inherent righteousnesse may be perfect
here againe he disputeth sophistically first because when he should prove that these habits of grace when they are infused to justify men as namely in baptisme are perfect and therefore that the imputation of christs righteousnesse is needlesse hee proveth that they may bee perfect in some men in some part of their life secondly whiles hee proveth severally the perfection or rather the possibility of the perfection of this or that vertue for perfection of inherent righteousnesse is not proved by the perfection of any of these severally but of them and of all others joyntly
for if there bee imperfection in any of those vertues or graces wherein inherent righteousnesse consisteth then is not the inherent righteousnesse perfect
but let us see how he proveth them severally
and first for faith which he proveth may bee perfect in this life what it may bee in some choise men and in some part of their life it is not here questioned but whether it be perfect when men are first justified thereby
the apostles in some part of their life had a great and a strong faith yet for some time

even after they were justified were by the censure of our saviour but undefined span alphabet

men of little faith


ii
but yet let us see how he proveth it may be perfect in this life
this he endevoureth to prove by sixe arguments his first proofe is this

if faith cannot be perfect in this life then it can never be perfect but it is not to be beleeved that so excellent a vertue shall never be perfect
the consesequence of the proposition he proveth because in the life to come it shall not be perfected but evacuated or made void
answer first to the prosyl logisme or proofe of the proposition for first that which hee calleth the evacuating of faith is the perfecting of it
it is eternall life

to knw god but in this life wee know him by faith in the life to come by vision here as it were in a and obscurely there face to face here wee are in our undefined span alphabet or growing age wherein wee must still grow towards perfection there we come to our undefined span alphabet and perfection here wee lead a mortall life there an immortall
as therefore our mortall life is swallowed up of immortality wherby it is perfected and our growing yeeres by perfect age our obscure knowledge and as it were in a glasse by intuitive aspect so our faith in the life to come is to bee swallowed up in vision and our hope in fruition
for faith and hope are not of things seen and enjoyed
but when the things beleeved are seen and the things hoped for enjoyed then are faith hope broght to their consummtion and perfection
secondly if our faith shall be evacuated as hee speaketh in the life to come that is an evidence that in this life it is unperfect
the apostle cor

saith that our knowledge meaning the knowledge of faith shall bee evacuated or made void and of no further use for wee know saith hee in part verse
and wee prophesie in part

but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be evacuated that is saith augustine

ut jam ex parte sit sed ex toto when was a child spake as a childe understood as a child reasoned as a child but when became a man evacuated childish things for now to wit by faith wee see and know as it were in or by a and as it were in a riddle or in a drke speech but then wee shall see face to face
now know in part but then shall know even as also am knowne
if therefore faith shall bee perfected by vision the consequence of the proposition with the proofe thereof is to be denyed and the evacuating of it by vision is a pregnant proofe that in this life it is but in part
as touching the assumption say that faith which is the evidence of things not seene and the substance of things hoped for shall never bee perfected untill the things which are beleeved shall bee seene and the things hoped for shall be enjoyed

iii
his second reason to prove that faith may be perfect in this

life is this because that faith which hath bene tryed in the forace of temptation is perfect whereto if hee assume that the faith which in justification is first infused either in infants when they are baptized or in others in their first justification hath beene tried in the fornace of temptation hee shall be ridiculous for it must be before by tryall it bee approved

but supposing him to speak of the faith of men being adulti and already justified his impertinent proofe standeth thus
that faith which is more precious than gold tryed in the fire is perfect that faith which hath beene tryed and approved by temptation is more precious than gold tryed in the fire witnesse saint peter epist


therefore that faith is perfect
answ
the proposition is to bee denyed
for temptations and afflictions are trialls not of the perfection but of the soundnesse and unfainednesse of faith
all faith which is undefined span alphabet that is true and unfained though not perfect endureth temptations
heresies are trialls whereby undefined span alphabet

not the perfect but the sound and upright christians may be knowne
affliction worketh patience

and patience worketh undefined span alphabet probation that is sheweth them to bee undefined span alphabet that is sound and approved who patiently beare afflictions
wherefore blessed is the man

that endureth temptation undefined span alphabet because when hee shall be found undefined span alphabet that is not a perfect but a sound and approved christian hee shall receive the crowne of life
temptation therefore is fitly called

undefined span alphabet the triall of our faith because it tryeth those who professe the faith whether they be undefined span alphabet sound and upright christians or undefined span alphabet that is hypocrites
but not all that be not perfect are undefined span alphabet nor any perfect though undefined span alphabet but all those that are not upright are undefined span alphabet that is to say hypocrites


iv
his third reason whosoever beleeve with all their heart or

their whole heart their faith is perfect some do beleeve with their whole heart as namely the eunuch act


therefore the faith of some is perfect
to helpe him will confesse that not onely some but all who have faith unfained beleeve with their whole heart
but the proposition is to bee denyed
for to beleeve with the whole heart being not legally but evanglically understood is to beleeve not with an heart

and an heart that is an heart divided but with an entire and upright heart wherein there is no guile

that is hypocrisie
so that hee which beleeveth integro corde with an upright heart or with faith unfained is said according to the scriptures to beleeve with his whole heart which proveth not the perfection but the soundnesse of faith
neither is it credible either that philip would require perfect faith in men before they be baptized for to such baptisme were needelesse or that the faith of the eunuch being a new convert not yet baptized was at that time perfect for what pray you was his faith was it not this

beleeve that iesus christ is the sonne of god which is the very first degree of justifying faith



his fourth reason because the faith of abraham was altogether

perfect
what will hee from thence inferre ergo the faith of all when they are first justified is perfect but hee commeth farre short of that conclusion
all that can bee concluded if the premisses were true is this
abraham had perfect faith abraham was justified therefore some justified person hath a perfect faith the proposition hee proveth out of rom


where it is said that hee was not weake in faith as many are who notwithstanding are justified

neither staggered at the promise of god through unbeleefe as zacharias did luk

who notwithstanding his unperfect faith was a man justified but was strong in faith being fully perswaded and therefore had undefined span alphabet fidei the full perswasion of faith which few or none have when they are first justified
now saith he this undefined span alphabet is the perfection of faith
answ first to the proposition that abrahams faith when hee was first justified was not perfect whatsoever it was afterwards secondly to the proofe of it out of rom


from which testimony it is indeed proved that the faith of abraham after he had beene for a long time justified was strong but not perfect
neither is the undefined span alphabet or full perswasion of this point that god is omnipotent which here is adscribed to abraham the perfection of faith nor yet every full perswasion of the truth of god concerning christ
for first there is undefined span alphabet

which is a full perswasion of assent to any truth of god but especially to the truth that iesus the sonne of the virgin mary is the eternall sonne of god and the saviour of all that truely beleeve in him which though it justifie if it be a lively and effectual assent joyned with an earnest desire and settled resolution of application yet is farre from the perfection of faith
for there is also

undefined span alphabet the full perswasion of speciall faith which goeth beyond the ordinary faith of all papists when thou certainely beleevest not onely that christ is the saviour of all the faithfull but also that he is thy saviour and that by him thou shalt be saved
now every assurance or assured perswasion is undefined span alphabet of which there are many degrees through which we must strive proceeding from faith to faith towards a full assurance which yet is never so full but that still more and more may and ought to be added to it
as for abraham though his faith were strong and excellent yet was it not perfect which appeareth by many signes
for if his faith had beene perfect then it had not needed to have beene strengthened and confirmed
why then did the lord in every chapter almost of his story renew and repeat his promises unto him why did hee confirme them by oath why did he seale them by the sacrament of circumcision which is the seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith
how came it to passe if abrahams faith was altogether perfect that twice he used that unlawfull shift which proceeded out of distrustfull feare calling his wife his sister whom to save his owne life he exposeth to danger for perfect faith expelleth feare and distrust


vi
his fifth reason is besides the purpose
for whereas hee

should prove that the faith of all the faithfull is in their justification perfect hee proveth that the faith of some speciall men who are highly commended in the scriptures as rare examples of a strong faith was after they had beene justified not a weake and a languishing but a strong and valiant faith to which purpose hee alleadgeth

and thereupon inferreth surely that faith which can overcome the world resist the devill and repell all his fiery darts must not be a weake or languishing but a strong and valiant faith
all which we grant
but yet deny either that it was so strong when they were first

justified thereby or that when it was at the strongest it was perfect
but here by the way would faine know of bellarmine and his consorts whether this strong faith so much commended in the scriptures bee onely a bare assent to the truth of the word and promises of god or rather an assurance which wee call speciall faith grounded on the word and promises applyed to our selves in his last reason he urgeth againe

the force of the word undefined span alphabet out of heb

signifying as he saith with our consent a most full and most perfect perswasion
we acknowledge that it signifieth a full perswasion which wee call assurance which is so farre from being in all the papists when they are justified as that none of them have it at all without speciall revelation which they will confesse is very rare
but yet of this assurance

there are degrees all aspiring in this life but none attaining to perfection for when wee have attained to some assurance wee must still labour

to increase it striving toward perfection
so much of faith


vii
as touching hope saith he the testimony of the apostle heb



may suffice for there he saith that our hope must be the anchor as it were of our soule safe and sure
answ
this argueth the assurance of hope in some of gods children after they have beene justified but not the perfection
sound hope is safe and sure because it never confoundeth or maketh ashamed rom

where by the way also would gladly learne if there may be such a full assurance of faith and hope as here bellarmine affirmeth and that without speciall revelation why there may not be the like assurance of salvation and of perseverance to salvation which elsewhere hee stoutly denieth and by his denyall confuteth his owne assertion in this place for if there cannot bee assurance of salvation much lesse can there bee perfection of faith and hope

bellarmines proofes that chàrity is perfect disproved




there remaineth charity which he would prove to bee

perfect not in all and that in their first justification which he ought to prove or else he proveth nothing but in som men in some part of their life after their first justification and this he proveth first by the testimonies of augustine and after by authority of scripture out of augustines booke de natura gratia

hee citeth two testimonies the former in these words ipsa charitas est verissima plenissima perfectissimáque justitia which augustine doth not speake of charity when it is infused in the act of justification nor of charity in generall but of that perfect charity whereunto nothing may bee added which hee confesseth to bee the truest the fullest the perfectest justice
the latter in these words

perfecta charitas perfecta justitia est perfect charity is perfect righteousnesse which wee deny not
but that no man in this life doth attaine to perfect charity augustine though he would not in that booke dispute of the possibility thereof because god if he please is able to bestow perfect justice and to make men free from all sinne yet in other places hee doth plainely and fully teach as first charity

in some is greater in some lesse and therefore not perfect in all that are jusified in others none at all but the most full and compleat which now cannot be increased is in no man so long as hee liveth here
now so long as it may be increased assuredly that which is lesse than it ought to be is a fault
by reason of which default there is not a righteous man upon the earth that doeth good and sinneth not for which default no man living shall be justified before god for which if we shall say that we have not sinne we deceive our selves and the truth is not in us for which though we be never so good proficients we must of necessity say forgive us our debts
and in another place

in part there is liberty in part bondage as yet no entire no pure no full liberty
and after let not sinne reigne in your mortall bodyes he doth not say let it not be but let it not reigne
as long as thou livest sinne must needs be in thy members onely let the kingdome be taken from it


ii
to this purpose a multitude of testimonies might bee cited

out his booke de perfectione justitiae which hee wrote against caelestius the pelagian who held that men may attaine to perfection in this life
will content my self with a few
tunc erit plena justitia quando plena sanitas quando plena charitas plenitudo enim legis charitas
tunc autem plena charitas quando videbimus cum sicui plena perfecta tunc

erit cum videbimus facie ad faciem
the

righteousnesse which we have here in our pilgrimage is to hunger and thirst after righteousnesse that hereafter we may be quotquot ergo perfecti hoc sapiamus id est quotquot perfectè currimus hoc sapiamus quòd nondum perfecti sumus ut illic perficiamur quo perfectè adhuc currimus ut cum venerit quod perfectum est quod ex parte est destruatur id est non jam ex parte sit sed toto quia fidei spei res ipsa non quae credatur speretur sed quae videatur teneaturque succedet charitas a quae in his tribus major est non auferatur sed augeatur impleatur contemplata quod credebat quod sperabat indepta
in qua plenitudine charitatis praeceptum illud implebitur diliges dominum deum tuum ex toto corde nam cùm est adhuc aliquid carnalis concupiscentiae quod vel continendo frenetur non omnimodò ex tota anima diligitur deus
so much of augustine


iii
divine testimonies saith he we meet with every where
for first our lord saith
greater charity hath no man than this that a man lay downe his life for his friends ioh

but it is evident that very many that is to say all the martyrs haue attained to this perfection of charity

answ
so to lay downe a mans life for others as christ did lay down his for us is the perfection of charity but the love of martyrs though great commeth farre short of this perfection
for as

cardinall tolet hath well observed upon this text the quantity or measure of charity may bee considered three wayes

by way of

estimation or appreciation
intension
extension

in all which respects the love of christ doth farre surpasse the love of

martyrs
first by way of appreciation because he gave that for us which is more and of greater value than what is given by martyrs
first because of the dignity of his person
for hee being the great

god and our saviour gave himselfe for us and therefore gave for us a greater gift than all the martyrs put together can give
secondly because where martyrs give their bodies only that they may save their owne soules christ gave himselfe that is both body and soule for us that hee might redeeme both our bodies and soules which both hee did assume that hee might give both for us not onely in his body suffering death even the death of the crosse but in his soule undergoing as our surety the wrath of god for us the feare whereof brought him into that agony which made him sweat drops of bloud and the sence of it upon the crosse made him cry out my god my god why hast thou forsaken me being for a time in his owne sence as a man separated from god which separation from god is the death of the soule
now that christ did thus farre give his soule as well as his body for us divers of the fathers especially those which confute the heresie of the apollinarists who denied that christ had an humane soule doe teach
cyrill saith

that christ gave his flesh a price of ransome for the flesh of all and his soule likewise a price of ransome for the soules of all
theodoret

the good shepheard gave his body and soule for his sheep who

have both body and soule
and againe the nature of men consisteth of body and soule both which being lost by sinne our lord having taken upon him both undefined span alphabet for our bodies hee gave his body and for our soules also his soule
irenaeus

that christ redeeming us by his bloud that is by the sufferings of his manhood gave his soule for our soules and his flesh for our our flesh ambrose

the divinity of the word was not offered in sacrifice for that which hee had put on he offered in himselfe· and hee put on that which before hee had not that is his whole manhood
for christ our priest both god and man upon the altar of his deity for it is the altar which sanctifieth the sacrifice did offer his whole manhood consisting both of body and soule as a whole burnt offering for us
wheras therefore in the doctrine of redemption mention is made either of his body alone· as col
pet

or of his soule onely as esa
that his soule was made an offering for sinne and in this place ioh

greater love hath no man than this that a man lay downe undefined span alphabet animam suam his soule for his friends wee are by a synechdoche to understand the whole manhood that is himselfe as hee was man
now it is a greater love for a man to give both body and soule for another than to give his body onely


iv
secondly in respect of intension it argueth greater love

when a man is willing of his owne accord and desirous to lay downe his life for others than when necessity is laid upon him
christ was willing

of his owne accord yea and earnestly desirous for so he saith

undefined span alphabet to lay downe his life for us
martyrs doe not yea ought not ordinaily offer themselves to death for qu amat periculum peribit in eo and our saviour hath taught them when they are persecuted in one city to flee to another
but they are and ought to bee willing to lay down their lives rather than deny the truth
our saviour prophecying of saint peters martyrdome iohn

saith when thou wast young thou diddest gird thy selfe and walke whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not
againe when a man doth lay downe his life freely as christ did without either tye of duty or expectation of recompence it argueth greater love than what is so done out of duety as that if hee did it not hee should sinne and so lose his soule

by seeking to save his life or out of love to himselfe to lay downe his life to save his owne soule which is the common case of martys


thirdly in respect of extension his love is greater that layeth

downe his life not onely for his friends and well willers and such as have beene good unto him for peadventure for such as the apostle saith
rom

some though hardly would adventure to dye and some few examples in that kind wee read of but also for sinners and for his enemies who though they doe not love him yet are beloved of him and therefore in respect of his affection are his friends as beloved of him though in respect of their affection enemies
thus our saviour

having loved us commendeth his love towards us rom
that when we were sinners verse
and by our sinnes enemies vers
hee dyed for us
but martyrs when they dye for others they lay downe their lives not for their enemies but for their brethren in christ iohn



vi
his second proofe is out of ioh

hee that keepeth the

word of god in him verily the love of god is perfected
but that the word of god may be kept the same apostle in the same epistle teacheth ioh

and his commandements are not grievous unto us
answ
the keeping of the commandements being an effect and fruit of love charity is said to bee perfected by it that is perfectly knowne as a good tree by his fruit· and as faith is said iam
to bee made perfect by good workes and as gods strength is perfected in our weakenesse

for hereby men are knowne to love god if they keepe his commandements exod

iohn

iohn

if any man say hee loveth god

and keepeth not his commandements he is a lyar that is to say an hypocrite whose love is not sincere and undefined span alphabet but fained and counterfeit
now they are said to keepe gods commandements not who perfectly fulfill them for such keepers of the law are no where to be found but such as keepe them with their soule psal

or with their whole heart psal

that is with a sincere and upright heart
they therefore who have an upright desire an unfained purpose a sincere endevour to walke in the obedience of all gods commandements are said to keepe them
this studium piettis is the perfection of a christian in this life which whosoever hath attained unto is most willing and ready to acknowledge his imperfection


vii
his third proofe is out of such places as speake of performing of duties as namely of loving god with the whole heart as ecl
david praised the lord with his whole heart and loved him that made him
deut

this perfection of charity is promised the lord will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed that thou maist love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soule
answ
by that phrase as have said nothing else is meant but the integriry and uprightnesse of heart
david praised god with his whole heart that is psal

with uprightnesse of heart hee served god with his whole heart that is he walked before him in truth and uprightnesse of heart king




viii
in the fourth and last place hee produceth those places

wherein mention is made of perfection as mat

be you perfect as your heavenly father is perfect
the apostle acknowledgeth himselfe and some others to be perfect
cor

wee speake wisedome among those that are perfect
phil


so many of us therefore as are perfect
now saith he it is evident that perfection in chrity for asmuch

as it is the bond of perfection
col

answ
first in generall to all such places by distinguishing perfection for there is a perfection in respect of parts and so an infant having all his parts is a perfect man
and such are all upright persons who walke in all gods commandements

making conscience of all their wayes and there is a perfection in respect of degree which no man attaineth unto in this life
againe there is an absolute perfection which none attaine unto here and a relative perfection in relation and comparison to others so those who are adulti growne men in religion are called perfecti in respect of babes
thirdly there is a perfection legall which in respect both of parts and degrees is absolutely conformable to the law which is the perfect rule of righteousnesse
of this there is no example but christ himselfe and there is a perfection evangelicall commended in the covenant of grace which consisteth not in the perfect and totall performance but in the integrity and uprightnesse of the heart that is in the sincere desire unfained purpose and upright endevour aspiring towards perfection which in the scriptures in many places goeth under the name of perfection as have shewed else where so that what is done with an upright heart is said to bee done with a perfect heart and with the whole heart and the man who is upright though subject to many imperfectious is called perfect


ix
to the places in particular answer and first to that matth


verse last which according to the wicked doctrine of the papists is not a precept of charity but a counsell of perfection which doth not belong to all that are justified bu is peculiar to those who professe themselves to live in a state of perfection
call it wicked because as appeareth verse
our saviour requireth this perfection as a necessary duty to be performed of all the sonnes of god who are to imitate the unpartiall bounty of god their heavenly father in dong good both to good and bad which in this conclusion in matthew is termed to be perfect and in luk
to bee mercifull as our father is mercifull
but though wee imitate this unpartiall bounty of god yet it doth not thereupon follow that wee have attained to the perfection thereof


in the other two places by men perfect are understood aduli

growne men opposed to younglings and infants who must be sedde with milke being not capable of strong meat for every one that useth milke is unexpert in the word of righteousnesse for he is undefined span alphabet a babe but strong meate which cor

is called wisedome belongeth to them that are undefined span alphabet adulti who are come to yeres of difcretion evensuch as by reason of use have their senses excercised to discerne both good and bad where undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet are opposed so cor

bee not undefined span alphabet children in understanding howbeit in malice be yee undefined span alphabet but in understadning be undefined span alphabet that is adulti such as are come to yeres of discretion understanding
not that any in this life wherein we are alwaies in our undefined span alphabet that is our growing age wherein we are to be renewed from day to day doe attaine to that ripenesse of age and stature or to that perfection of growth as that we should not need to grow any more
for as the apostle sheweth in the next place viz phil


which bellarmine had cited against himselfe if hee had recited the whole verse and

much more if the whole

context wherein the apostle confesseth of himselfe that hee had not attained to perfection but that hee did strive

and preasse towards it and thereupon inferreth verse
let us therfore so many as are perfect bee thus minded that is as wee heard before out of augustine

let us bee of this mind that we are not yet perfect but still should strive towards perfection
and whereas the apostle col

calleth charity the bond of perfection his meaning is that it is the most perfect bond which is among men to unite them together for according to the hebrew phrase which is usuall in the writings of the apostle viculum perfectionis is vinculum perfectissimum qu plures inter se colligantur for it is not undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet that is as cajetan speaketh vinculum conjungens amantes or as

iustinian perfectissimum quoddam vinculum


xi
from these weake premises bellarmine inferreth a stout conclusion

if saith he we may have perfect faith hope and charity and consequently perfect inherent justice in vaine the hereticks ge about to prove imputation of righteousnesse as though by no other meanes we could bee simply and absolutely just
answere though in some part of our life after wee have beene good proficients in christianity wee might seeme to attaine to that perfection whereof hee dreameth yet this would not prove that wee are justified by a perfect righteousnesse inherent
for that which papists call their first justification being the justification of a sinner whereof this question is to bee understood is of incipients such as bee infants in age or at least in religion who are farre from the perfection of inherent justice
but if in no part of this life wee cannot attaine to the perfection of justice then must the imputation of christs righteousnesse bee acknowledged to bee so necessary to justification as that without it wee cannot bee justified

cap viii
the rest of bellarmines arguments against imputation of

christs righteousnesse answered




in the fourth argument bellarmine whiles hee

fighteth with an idle fancie which like a man of straw hee hath set up against himselfe hee yeeldeth such is the force of verity to the truth
the man of straw is that christs righteousnesse is so imputed to imputed to us as that thereby wee are formally

righteous which never any of us for ought know affirmed who hold it an absurdiy that the righteousnesse whereby we are

formally and by consequent inherenly just should be without us as indeed the imputed righteousnesse of christ is out of us in him
but against this larva bellarmine fighteth that if we being formally unjust by inherent unrighteousnesse should also be formally just by imputation of that righteousnesse which is without us there wee ought not to bee called just but unjust as an ethiopian clothed with white is to be called blacke because the denomination is to be taken from the inward forme rather then from the outward
answere that so many as are justified are also sanctified and that so many as are justified and sanctified are neither to be termed formally unjust by the remnants of originall sinne remaining in us nor formally just by christs righteousnesse imputed
for though it be true that in respect of sinne remaining and inhabiting in us wee are according to the sentence and rigour of the law sinners yet we are according to the doctrine of the gospell to bee called just and that by a twofold justice
first and principally by the perfect righteousnesse of christ imputed by which we are justified and doe stand perfectly righteous before god in christ being made as the apostle speaketh

the righteousnesse of god in him
secondly by a righteousnesse begun by which we are not justified but in some measure sanctified which though it be unperfect by reason of the flesh ever accompanying it for the best of us are but partly spirit and partly flesh yet from it the denomination is to be taken as from the better part and so the scriptures call iob and others just who notwithstanding acknowledged themselves to be sinners
and indeed the more righteous a man is the more doth he acknowledge

and feele his owne sinfulnesse which is a truth confessed by some of the papists themselves as shewed before out of cardinall contarenus


ii
now let us see what bellarmine yeeldeth
if they did not hold

saith he that we are formally righteous by christs righteousnesse but their meaning onely were that christs merits are imputed to us because they are given unto us of god and we may offer them to god for our sins because christ tooke upon him the burden of satisfying for us and of reconciling us to god recta esset eorum sententia they should hold that which is right now assume but we doe not hold that wee are formally righteous by christs righteousnesse imputed but our meaning only is that christs merits as namely his sufferings and obedience are imputed unto us and that they are given and communicated unto us of god namely by imputation the lord accepting of them in our behalfe as if we had performed the same in our owne persons
conclude therefore that by bellarmines owne confession wee hold the right
and yet this is that which he doth mainely oppugne in his whole disputation by all the rest of his arguments
if the papists would sincerely and constantly hold themselves to that which bellarmine here yeeldeth there should not need to bee any controversie betweene us in this behalfe
for as they would confesse that wee are justified by the merits of christ imputed so wee would professe that by righteousnesse inherent received from christ we are in some measure sanctified
but what soever confession

the truth hath expressed from bellarmine here and in some other places yet hee and all the rest of them mainely oppose the imputation of christs righteousnesse and wickedly deride it stifly maintaining that they are justified by righteousnesse inherent by which also they hope to merit eternall life


iii
in this fifth argument he doth againe deprave our assertion as though wee held that christs righteousnesse were so imputed to justification as if it were our inward and formall righteousnesse and thereupon inferreth that if that be true then ought we to be held and esteemed as righteous as christ himselfe and therefore ought to be called redeemers and saviours of the world and such like
answ
wee doe not hold that we are justified by the righteousnesse of christ as our formall justice neither doth it follow upon our assertion that we are as righteous as christ hmselfe and much lesse that wee are redeemers and saviours of the world
for wee doe acknowledge a great difference and disproportion betweene the head who is absolutely just of in and by himselfe and the members who are not just either of in or by themselves but by his righteousnesse freely and undeservedly communicated to them being sinners in themselves who being justified and redeemed by imputation of christs righteousnesse are thereby proved not to be redeemers but the redeemed of the lord
but of this argument have spoken sufficiently

heretofore


iv
his sixth argument is thus frmed what we lost in adam we receive in christ which he proveth out of ienaeus and augustine
imputed righteousnesse wee did not lose in adam but that inward righteousnesse in which we are created according to gods image in holinesse and righteousnesse therefore imputed righteounesse wee doe not receive by christ but righteousnesse inherent
answ
this syllogisme is a meere paralogisme the assumption thereof being negative in the firt figure as they call it
as if should argue thus every good logician is undefined span alphabet a reasonable creature bellarmine is not a good logician because in the first figure hee assumeth negatively therefore hee is not a reasonable creature but if hee would argue thus what adam lost wee receive in and by christ and what adam lost not wee doe not receive by christ adam lost inherent righteousnesse and not imputed therefore by christ wee receive inherent righteousnesse and not imputed then would deny the latter part of the proposition for wee doe receive by christ more than we lost adam

adam was mutable and the graces which he had were not without repentance but christ maketh the faithfull

inseparabiles id est usque in finem perseverantes and the saving graces which wee receive by him

are undefined span alphabet hoc est saith

augustine sine mutatione stabiliter fixa
adam lost an earthly paradise but by christ we receive an inheritance in heaven

adam stood righteous before god in his owne righteosnesse but wee stand righteous before god in the righteousnesse of christ which farre surpasseth the righteousnesse of adam


hs seventh argument if by the righteousnesse of christ imputed

unto us we may truly be said to be just and the sonnes of god· then by our sinne imputed to christ hee may in like manner bee trly called a sinner and which is horrible to thinke the sonne of the devill but the latter is blasphemous therefore the former
answ
the proposition containeth a double consequence which is to be distinguished
the first if by the righteousnesse of chist imputed to us wee may truly bee said to bee righteous then christ by imputation of our sinne may truly though not formally bee called a sinner but the consequent is fale therefore the antecedent this proposition grant as being firmely grounded on cor


and doe confesse that christ was so made sinne that is a sinner for us as wee are made in him the righteousnesse of god that is righteous by the righteousnesse of him who is god that is to say by imputation
but the assumption doe deny
for it is most tre and no dishonour to christ our blessed saviour but that which wonderfully setteth forth his unspeakable goodnesse and love towards us· that hee which knew no sinne but was in himselfe most holy and righteous and blessed for evermore by taking upon him our sinne and by undertaking as our surety our debt was content to bee reputed and by imputation made a sinner that is guilty of sinne and accursed and accordingly punished as a sinner that we might be made righteous and happy in him
thus the hebrewes call them that are punished sinners king


and that those are freed from punishment innocent gen

but the other part of the consequence if we by imputation of christs righteousnesse become the sonnes god then which abhorre to speake christ by imputation of our sinnes should bee made the sonne of the devill utterly deny
for though to bee made the childe of god is a consequent of being made righteous by imputation adoption going alwayes with justification yet to become the childe of the devill is no consequent of being made a sinner by imputation in respect of him who is most righteous and holy in himselfe
for to undertake the burden of others mens sinnes and to bee willing to have them imputed to him being himselfe most righteous is the property of the immaculate lambe of god

who tooke upon him the sin of the world and for that cause is most worthy to be

accounted just and to bee acknowledged the sonne of god
for hee that satisfieth for others is most just saith

bellarmine


vi vpon this syllogisme bellarmine inferreth another
if therfore

christ saith he because in himselfe hee was holy was called not a sinner but just though our sinne was imputed to him then by the like reason we after our justification we were indeed sinners and uncleane in our selves should not be called just but unjust though christs righteousnesse be imputed to us
but the scriptures after the lver of regeneratin hee might better have said after regeneration it selfe calleth us righteous and holy and the sonns

of god as appeareth by many places
these are the premisses
the conclusion should be this therfore after our justification we are not indeed sinners and uncleane in our selves
but in stead of that pharisaicall conclusion he concludeth thus therefore we are not justified by imputation of christs rightousnesse but by that righteousnesse it selfe which is inherent and abiding in us which conclusion is neither it selfe deduced from these premisses neither is it a consectary of that which ought to have beene the conclusion
for although after our justification wee be as before we were not righteous and that by righteousnesse inherent as abraham was and all the faithfull are yet it doth not follow that wee are justified thereby
for our inherent righteousnesse is a consequent of our justification and not a cause thereof not going before justificandos but following justificatos
but to this syllogisme first returne the like
if christ though most righteous in himselfe was not onely accounted but really punished as a sinner yea made

a sinner and a

curse for us by taking upon him our sinne which as our debt was laid upon him as our surety and imputed to him then by the like reason wee though sinners in our selves are by imputation of his righteousnesse made righteous before god in him as before hath evidently beene proved

out of cor



vii
secondly as christ though ou sinnes were imputed to

him was called holy and just because hee was so in himselfe so wee though adams transgression was imputed unto us and the corruption which hee contracted was derived unto us and ever dwelleth in our mortall bodies yet being once justified by christ are notwithstanding that habituall sinne inhabiting in us and these actuall transgessions which through humane frailty we daily commit in regard whereof we are by the verdict of the law sinners we are say termed just and that in two respects first and principally in respect of our justification wherin we were made just by imputation of christs righteousnesse secondly in respect of our regeneration whereby inherent righteousnesse is begun in us
and howsoever in the regenerate man there is both the flesh and the spirit the old man and the new in regard whereof he may in divers respects be termed either a sinner in respect of the flesh and the fruits thereof according to the sentence of the law or a righteous man in respect of the spirit and the fruits thereof according to the doctrine of the gospell yet the denomination is taken from the better part as an heape of wheat and chaffe wherein perhaps is more chaffe than wheat is called an heape of wheat and a wedge of gold wherein perhaps there is more drosse than pure mettall is called a wedge of gold as have said
and whereas upon his premisses this conclusion is inferr'd therfore after the laver of regeneration we are not verè and indeed sinners nor uncleane in our selves you may see what pharisaicall conceit the papists have of themselves that being once ex opere operato justified by their sacraments though they neither have knowledge nor faith nor repentance nor any sanctifying grace in them yet they are not truely and indeed sinners in themselves neither is there

any sinne in them
and therefore unlesse they will play the hypocrites and dally with god they ought not to pray as christ taught his owne apostles to pray forgive us our sinnes
but by saying there is no sinne in themselves it is evident that there is no truth in them loh



viii
his eighth argument is taken out of the canticles where christ is compared to the husband or bridegrome the church or justified soule to the spouse which spouse is said to bee most faire and beautifull yea tota pulchra viz by beauty inheret in her selfe and not by the beauty of her husband imputed to her
answ
from allegoricall scriptures no sound argument can bee drawne especially when they are not understood
but be it that by the spouse is meant the church of christ
is it the church triumphant as it mayseeme when she is said to be tota pulchra then is it to no purpose alleaged
as for the church militant that commendation cannot be verified of it by reason of many deformed members which be alwayes in the visible church besides which the papists acknowledge no other
but if the church militant bee meant then of what time for it may not be thought that what is spoken in the canticles doth agree to the church at al times
the spouse which somtimes is said to be tota pulchra in other places is said to be blacke sometimes she enjoyethher beloved somtimes she is at a losse sometimes she adhereth to her love sometimes she neglecteth him
but suppose she be alwaies and altogether beautiful which me thinks should hardly be verified of the church of rome besides which they acknowledg no other true church especially when the visible head therof the popes have beene monsters of men their clergie sodomiticall their laity void of all truth and power of religion their whole church in respect of her faith hereticall in regard of her religion idolatrous and in respect of both apostaticall but suppose say the true universall church which is the company of the elect to be wholly beautifull this totall beauty cannot be understood of her inherent righteousnesse which is stayned and unperfect but of that righteousnesse which her husband hath imputed and imparted to her as we heard before

out of gregory nyssen


ix yea but bellarmine will prove that this beauty is inherent first because her beauty is described as that which is proper to women and his as that which is proper to men and therefore that his beauty is one and hers another
secondly because it is absurd to imagine hee absurdly chargeth us that the spouse of christ is deformed in herselfe being only adorned outwardly with her husbands garment
but this labour bellarmine might have spared
for wee doe acknowledge that the true church is beautifull and that by a twofold beauty the one the perfect beauty of her husband communicated to her by imputation the other unperfect and inherent which being but begun in this life is to be perfected in the life to come but howsoever this inward beauty be unperfect yet because it is upright her husband is delighted

therewith and in regard of this inward uprightnesse and integrity she is said to be glorious within
in which respect the tabernacle of the congregation was a fit type of the church militant which in outward appearance is black and brown like

the tents

of kedar but within faire and beautifull like the hangings of salomon even as the tabernacle which outwardly made but a homely shew being covered with rams skinnes and badgers skins was inwardly glorious wee acknowledge therefore that there is inherent righteousnesse in the true church and in all the true and lively memers thereof
in regard whereof in the creed we professe our selves to beleeve that she is holy and that the communion of her members among themselves and with their head is the communion of saints
but that by this inherent righteousnesse either the church or any member thereof is justified before god we doe utterly deny



his ninth and tenth arguments will put together because

one answere may serve for both
his ninth reason is this by justification the heart is cleansed that it may be prepared for the vision of god for untill it be cleane it cannot see god
the tenth christ suffered and gave himselfe for his church that he might sanctifie it heb

ephes


tit

loh

which is not done by imputation

both those objections arise from the wilfull ignorance of the papists who will not distinguish justification from sanctification
the righteousnesse of sanctification of which these places speake wee acknowledge to be inherent though that of justification be imputed and that which have shewed heretofore as wee are by justification entitled to the kingdome of heaven so by sanctification we are fitted and prepared for it
we confesse that the heart must be cleane and pure before it can see god and that by sanctification begun in this life the heart is prepared but never fully cleansed untill it come to see god wee acknowledge that our sanctification is the end not onely of our redemption but also of our election ephes


of our creation and recreation according to gods image ephes


of our vocation thes

of our justification and reconciliation col

that sanctification is the way wherein men being elected called justified are to walke to their glorification
but though it bee via regni yet it is not causa regnandi that our saviour by his spirit doth truly really and inherently worke the worke of sanctification in all those that are justified
but beseech you what is the force of both these arguments our hearts must be cleansed by inherent purity therefore we are not justified by imputed righteousnesse
christ dyed and gave himselfe for us that wee might bee sanctified with true inherent grace therefore we are not justified by righteousnesse imputed
christ gave himselfe for us

that he might redeeme and justifie us that being reedeemed

and justified wee might worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him

finally bellarmine telleth us that many other arguments might bee produced but these he saith were the principall which notwithstanding for the most part were such as deserved with scome to bee rejected rather than to bee in good earnest refuted which neverthelesse argueth not the insufficiencie of the disputant but the badnesse of the cause which admitteth no better proofes

a treatise of ivstification
the sixth booke concerning faith
cap what faith is and that it is not without knowledge



th fifth capitall errour of the papists in the article

of justification is concerning justifying faith which hath many branches


concerning the nature of it viz what it is and therein also they erre diversly

concerning the subject of it both and undefined span alphabet that is the parties whose it is and the parts of the man wherein it is

concerning the object of faith

concerning the act or effect of it which is to justifie where are three questions the first concerning the act it selfe whether it doth indeed justifie or onely dispose to justification the other two concerning the manner how it justifieth the former whether instrumentally as the hand to receive christ who is our righteousnesse or formally as part of inherent righteousnesse
the other whether faith doth justifie alone


ii
as touching the first what faith is they hold justifying faith

to be but a bare assent to all or any truth revealed by god which as it is in their opinion without speciall apprehension of christ· so it may be void of knowledge and severed from charity as they teach

that faith in generall is an assent and that it may be defined to bee a firme and willing assent to every truth revealed by god grounded on the authority

of god revealing it we willingly agree
for hereby faith is distinguished from all other acts or habits of our minde
and first from doubting in that it is an assent for in doubting the assent is withheld which is undefined span alphabet from whence is undefined span alphabet as contrariwise to assent

is undefined span alphabet
and that faith is assent it is evident because undefined span alphabet faith is a perswasion derived from the verbe

undefined span alphabet which signifieth to bee perswaded or to beleeve and a man is said to assent unto or to beleeve that of the truth whereof he is perswaded hence it is that the act of faith which is to beleeve is expressed sometimes by the verbe undefined span alphabet

act




heb

but most plainely act


undefined span alphabet some beleeved the things which are spoken but some beleeved not
secondly from opinion in that faith is a firme assent or as basil

speaketh undefined span alphabet an undoubted assent for he that beleeveth the truth of god hath as it were put his seale unto it
but opinion is the judgement of things contingent which may happen to bee false
sed fidei falsum subesse non potest but the subject of faith cannot be false
thirdly in that it is a willing assent from the forced beliefe of devils and some desperate wicked men who beleeve that which they abhorre or as saint iames speaketh beleeve and tremble iam

mat

fourthly from all other knowledge in that it is an assent to truth revealed or related by god and grounded upon the authority of god speaking in his word for faith commeth by the hearing of the word
so saith saint

basil undefined span alphabet

undefined span alphabet
faith therefore is an undoubted assent of things heard in the assured perswasion of things preached by the grace of god
and that is it which bellarmine citeth out of augustine

quòd intelligimus aliquid rationi debemus quòd autem credimus authoritati that we understand any thing we owe to reason but that wee beleeve to authority
all other firme assent is given to things either in themselves evident to sense or reason or to such as are manifested by discourse
but the object of faith is not discerned by sence nor sounded by reason such as is the mystery of the holy trinity and of the incarnation of christ neither is faith

of things seene
eye hath not seene

nor eare heard neither have entred into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him
and wheras the certainty of all other knowledge is grounded upon sence or experience and reason the certainty of this knowledge is grounded upon the authority of god speaking in his word
for which cause the certainty of faith is greater than of any other knowledge for howsoever sense and reason may be deceived yet the ground of faith is unfallible which is the authority of god who is

undefined span alphabet one that cannot lye a god of truth yea truth it selfe whereupon clemens

alexandrinus saith undefined span alphabet therefore it selfe is a firme demonstration because truth accompanieth faith those things which are delivered god and basill

what is the property of faith an undoubted plerophorie or full perswasion of the truth of the words inspired of god which is not shaken with any reasoning either induced from naturall necessity or formed to piety
and such is the certainety of faith that the apostle defineth it

that it is undefined span alphabet the subsistence which giveth a being to things which now have not a being which is nothing but an assured beleefe as the word is used cor



heb

and the evidence of things not appearing or not seene which the greeke sholiast

in mine opinion very well explaneth
faith it selfe is the subsistence or substance of things hoped for
for because those things which are in hope are without subsistence as yet not extant faith becommeth the substance and subsistence of them making them after a sort to exist and to be present because it doth beleeve they are
faith also is the evidence and demonstration of things not seene
and faith sheweth things to be visible which are not seene how in the minde and in hope beholding things which doe not appeare


iii
but howsoever faith is an assent and is in generall so to be defined as have said yet justifying faith is not a bare assent either destitute of knowledge or severed from charity or without speciall apprehension and application for these are three errors of the papists now in order to be confuted
as touching the first the papists doe not onely hold that justifying faith may be without knowledge but that also it may better bee defined by ignorance

than by knowledge
this faith which is without knowledge they call implicite faith because they beleeving some one common principle as namely beleeve the bly catholicke church doe thereby beleeve implicitè whatsoever is to be beleeved that is whatsoever the catholicke church beleeveth and propoundeth to bee beleeved
and therefore this they call also an entire faith because thereby a man doth not onely beleeve the written word but also unwritten verities which are the traditions of the church of rome and both of them not for themselves but for the authority of the church propounding them to bee beleeved
now they teach that not only for lay men it is sufficient to beleeve as the church beleeveth which was the colliars

faith so much commended by cardinall hosius

and others for he being examined by a learned man what he beleeved answered beleeve that which the church beleeveth and being asked what the church beleiveth answered againe that which beleeve and so in a round that he beleeved what the church beleeved and that the church beleeved as he beleeved but also that it is the safest for all even for those that are learned to rest in this faith
especially when they are assaulted by satan with whom they say it is not safe to contend by scriptures but rather to oppose that onely article against him
as the said learned man who had opposed the collyar found by experience
for he being afterwards assaulted by satan when he was deadly sicke and being not able to defend himselfe by scriptures he was faine to bake himselfe to the colliars faith which no doubt is the readiest

way for them who professe a faith not conformable to the scriptures to put the devil to silence who will rest well content with such an answer whereas if they should stand to the scriptures the devill would be able to confute them
as he did luther whiles hee was a papist in the question concerning the private masse which he did not to teach him the truth but by true accusations to bring him to despaire


iv
this doctrine of the papists concerning implicite faith is

both absurdly false and notoriously wicked
false in diverse respects
first in that they say justifying faith may be without knowledge when as first of all faith it selfe is a kind of knowledge yea a kind of certaine knowledge yea of all others the most certaine knowledge as have already shewed proving that it is that knowledge which we have by divine relation or report grounded on the authority of god speaking in his word
secondly because faith oftentimes in the scriptures is called knowledge or acknowledgment as ioh

this is eternall life to know thee the onely true god and iesus christ whom thou hast sent
now we know god in the life to come by vision in this life by faith as their owne writers testifie
maldonat

on that place what is the cause saith he that he seemeth to place eternall life in knowledge alone that is in faith onely and iansenis

vita aeterna inchoativè imperfectè hic habetur cognoscendo deum per fidem habetur autem in perfectè cognoscendo deum per visionem

where by undefined span alphabet the knowledge or acknowledgement of christ and his truth is meant nothing else but faith ioh

hereby we doe know that we doe know him that is beleeve in him if we doe keepe his commandements he that saith he knoweth him namely by faith and keepeth not his commandements is a lyar and the truth is not in him
heb

by faith we understand or know that the worlds were formed by the word of god where the act of faith is expressed by this term of understanding that which we beleeve cor

we know that is we beleeve for otherwise it cannot be known but by faith that after the dissolution of our earthly tabemacle we have an eternall habitation in heaven
thirdly because in the scriptures faith and knowledge are so linked together that what we acknowledg we beleeve what we beleeve we know ioh

we beleeve and know that thou art that christ ioh

that you may know and beleeve that the father is in me and in him
ioh

they have knowen surely that came out from thee saith christ unto his father and they have beleeved that thou didst send me
eph

till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god
tim

to bee received with thankesgiving of them which beleeve and know the truth ioh

we have knowne and beleeved the love that god hath to us
fourthly it is not possible that a man should beleeve acknowledge or assent firmely to that which he doth not know so much as by relation or hearesay how can they beleeve in him of whom they

have not heard and by hearing knowen rom

and who knoweth not that the assent of faith determineth the judgement to that particular which is beleeved as for example if beleeve the resurrection my judgement actually assenteth to that particular
but if never have so much as heard or understood that god hath revealed such a thing that there shall be a resurrection how can possibly beleeve it or actually assent unto it
and therefore implicite faith is so farre from being a justifying faith that it is not so good as the bare historicall faith which not onely wicked men but the devils themselves have
for historicall faith hath in it an actuall assent and implyeth a knowledge at least by relation of that which is beleeved
but implicite faith hath neither
fifthly to the implicite faith the definition offaith heb

doth in no sort agree for as it is so farre from being the substance of things hoped for that it doth not so much as know what are the things hoped for so it is further from being an evidence of things not seene which implyeth a certaine knowledge of things by relation which are not seen or knowne by sence or reason
sixthly that which implyeth a contradiction is false and absurd but the profession of the implicite faith made by a simple man viz that hee beleeveth whatsoever the catholicke church beleeveth implyeth a contradiction not onely because hee doth not beleeve every yea scarce any particular but also through his ignorance sometimes doth actually beleeve that which the church doth not beleeve or doth deny credit to that which the church beleeveth
but here now is the speciall priviledge of implicite faith

that although a man beleeve an errour as that god the father is greater than the sonne or ancienter than he or that the persons of the trinity are divided by locall distance one from another it is no offence so long as he thinketh the church beleeveth so and so saith gabriel himselfe
if any man doe beleeve thinking that the church doth so beleeve though it bee erroneous he sinneth not so that hee doe not obstinately adhere to his errour as was said before notab

yea saith hee that which is more this faith is meritorious for such an one should not onely not sinne but also by so beleeving that which is false hee should merit
thus not onely hee is said to beleeve who indeed doth not beleeve nor give assent to the truth but also he who dissenteth from the truth even from that which the church doth hold


secondly they are absurd in saying that faith may better be defined by ignorance than by knowledge for notitia knowledge is the genus both of faith and of science whereas ignorance is a privation of knowledge
it were therefore very strange if faith which is an habit of the mind should be defined by a privation and namely of that habit which is the genus of it

yea but saith bellarmine faith is opposed to science and therefore better to be defined by ignorance than by knowledge
answere it is opposed to science not as a privation that it should bee defined by ignorance but as a species of the same kind undefined span alphabet contra divided
for notitia as the genus is divided into science and faith the former being a

knowledge of things either manifest in themselves which is called undefined span alphabet or made manifest by discourse of reason which is called undefined span alphabet the latter being a knowledge of things neither manifest to sence nor reason but knowne onely by relation from god where by the way you are to observe that the knowledge required in faith is not undefined span alphabet of the cause such as is in science but onely undefined span alphabet which is to beleeve the relation to be true and that whatsoever god revealeth is infallibly true
and therfore by faith our judgements are captivated to yeeld assent to divine revelations though either they may be above reason or may seeme to be against sence or reason
for though sence and reason may bee deceived yet the ground of our faith which is the authority of god cannot be deceived nec fidei falsum subesse potest neither can the subject of faith be false
as for example the mysteries of the trinity and of the incarnation of our saviour bee above our reason the articles of the creation of all things from nothing and of the resurrection of the body seeme contrary to reason the article of eternall life contayneth such things as never eye did see

nor eare heare neither did they ever enter into the heart of man and so of other articles of christian religion which notwithstanding we doe firmely beleeve and undoubtedly know to be true as god hath revealed the same grounding this our faith and knowledge on the authority of god speaking in his word
this distinction of knowledge being acknowledged that the knowledge of faith is neither the certaine intelligence of things in themselves manifest to sense or reason nor that science which is undefined span alphabet by the causes or attained by discourse of reason but onely undefined span alphabet that the things revealed by god are infallibly true by reason of his authority who is truth it selfe might serve as a sufficient answer to so many of bellarmines arguments and allegations as seeme worth the answering
but will briefly examine his proofes which are allegation of scriptures reason and testimonies of fathers


vi
as for his allegation of scripture the first place alleadged out of esa

is not as bellarmine alleageth it unlesse you beleeve you shall not understand but if you beleeve not you shall not be established or as the vulgar latine which bellarmine ought to stand to non permnebitis as contrariwise chron


if you beleeve in the lord you shall be established or as the latine securieritis
neither doth it follow that faith is not knowledge because without faith we cannot come to the certaine intelligence of that which we beleeve
for as knowledge of the thing revealed goeth before faith so faith goeth before the exact

understanding and comprehension
in the two next places cor



where faith as he saith is distinguished as a severall gift from knowledge by faith is not meant justifying faith but the faith

of miracles as have else where shewed
neither doe wee deny but that knowledge may be a distinct gift from faith
as that knowledge which is either principiorum or conclusionum which is undefined span alphabet
neither is knowledge alwayes joyned with acknowledgement which is faith though acknowledgement implyeth knowledge alwayes
knowledge therefore

may be without faith but faith cannot be without knowledge
to the fourth out of cor

that where knowledge is there needs no captivating of the understanding
answere that faith being onely notitia undefined span alphabet and giving firme assent to that whereof it knoweth no reason yea though perhaps it seeme above or against reason subjecteth or captivateth the understanding to the authority of god
the last is

from those places wherein the obedience of faith is mentioned
for saith he obedience in beleeving were not needfull if by faith knowledge were given to men
answere that in those places faith doth signifie the doctrine of faith that is the gospell the truth which men are then said to obey rom

neither should it seeme strange to bellarmine that by faith men attaine to knowledge meane to greater knowledge when he urging even now that place esai

said faith is a degree and way to knowledge


vii
to the testimony of irenaeus if it were entirely cited would subscribe
for speaking of those words cor
scientia inflat dilectio autem adificat and having thereupon inferred that it were better to know but a little and to love god than in a conceit of great knowledge to bee found blasphemous against god hee repeateth the same againe melius itáque est sicuti predixi nihil omnio scientem quempia ne quidem unam causam cujusllbet eorum quae facta sunt cur factum credere deo persever are in ejus dilectione quae honorem vivificat nec aliud inquirere adscientiam nisi isvm christum filium dei qui pro nobis crucifixs est quàm per quaestionum subtilitates multiloquium in impietatem cadere
where first observe that the knowledge whereof he speaketh is that whereby the causes or reasons of things are knowne
and wee doe confesse that a man may and ought simply to beleeve god without such knowledge and secondly that he speaketh by way of comparison that it is better for a man to content himselfe with the knowledge of christ alone joyned with love which is not to be accounted implicite faith for the apostle himselfe determined to know

nothing among the corinthians but christ and him crucified than affecting the knowledge of subtile and curious questions to fall into impiety


viii
the place in clemens alexandrinus maketh wholly

against the ignorance of implicite faith
for whereas one there excuseth his ignorance as many now a daies doe because hee was not hee answereth though thou hast not learned to read yet undefined span alphabet for hearing thou canst not be excused because it is not to be taught
now saith he in the words which bellarmine citeth faith is a thing belonging to the wise not according to the world but according to god such as are taught of god and it is learned without letters
faith therefore is to bee learned namely by hearing and therefore is a knowledge and they attaine unto it who are not worldly wise but such as are wise according to god and therefore

such as have knowledge
neither can men as he saith excuse their ignorance or their want of faith because they are not booke learned for though they cannot read yet they may heare and by hearing

faith commeth


hilarie inquiring how we should so be one in the father and

in the sonne as the father is in the sonne and the sonne in the father saith that in such mysteries habet non tam veniam quàm praemium ignorare that is non intelliger quod credas quia maximum stipendium fidei est sperare quae nescias it hath not so much pardon as reward not to know what thou beleevest
for it is the greatest stipend of faith to hope for those things which thou understandest not
for as the apostle saith they never entred into the heart of man the things hich god hath prepared for us
and no doubt but it is a great commendation of faith when a man giveth glory to god undoubtedly beleeving that to be true which god in he greatest mysteries hath revealed though he doth not comprehend the reason thereof
the thing rvealed hee beleeveth to bee true and knoweth undefined span alphabet though hee doe not distinctly exactly and clearely comprehend undefined span alphabet the reason thereof which hee findeth to be incomprehensible what then saith hilarie is there no office of faith if nothing can be comprehended imò hoc officium fides profiteatur id quod cred incomprehensibile sibi esse se scire yea saith hee let faith professe this offic that it knoweth that thing to be incomprehensible to it selfe which it beleeveth


out of augustine he citeth five places wherein he teacheth

nothing but what we freely confesse that the faithfull for he speaketh not particularly of the ignorant but of all the faithfull beleeve those things which they doe not comprehend or as hee speaketh in the first

place quae certa intelligentia non possunt discernere which by certaine intelligence they are not able to discerne which in the second

place he calleth intelligendi vivacitaem in the third

intelligentiam mysteriorum which in the fourth place hee sheweth not to goe before but to follow after faith
for first by reltion wee know undefined span alphabet what god revealeth then wee assent thereto and having assented we come afterwards more distnctly to understand it
but he who seeketh not onely to know the thing but the reason thereof may as he saith in the

fifth plac be called rationalis that is a quaerist whereas a faithfull man should say nescio qod credo understand not that which beleeve
vis scire· saith hee naturam dei hoc scito quod nescias wilt thou know the nature of god know this that thou know'st it not
for as elswhere

he saith debemus credere quod intelligere nondum valeamus quàm verissimè dictum est per prophetam nisi credideritis non intelligetis
and in the sermon

even now alleaged
nobis sufficiat let it suffice us to know concerning the trinity what god hath vouchsafed to christ hath beene willing to shew that onely know when a thought shall arise and propound this question what is god and what is the reason that is the proper nature of the trinity let it suffice us to beleeve that it is that is undefined span alphabet and not rashly seeke the reason of the trinity


xi
that which he citeth out of prosper and is the same which

even now recited out of augustin is true that faith goeth before cleare understanding and men must beleeve that they may understand more clearely
for as he truly citeth out of the philosopher addiscentem oportet credere the learner must beleeve and as augustine saith of unbeleevers non possunt discere quia nolunt credere they cannot learne because they will not beleeve and as the apostle of the unbeleeving israelites that the hearing of the word did not profit them because it was not mingled

with faith
all this notwithstanding no man can bee said to have learned that which he did not first conceive and in some measure understand as it is taught for undefined span alphabet which is to learne doth also signifie to understand and then beleeveth that it is so and so beleeving what is taught groweth more distinctly and clearely to understand what he did beleeve
but they which have but implicite faith doe not so much as know the particulars of the catholike faith which are to be beleeved so farre are they from either learning or beleeving them


xii
the brutish argument which he borroweth from

gregories allegory of the oxen and asses feeding together iob
besides that it is to no purpose because allegories specially such as farre fetcht and not intended by the holy ghost prove nothing is also depraved
for gregorie doth not say that by the oxen are meant the learned by the asses feeding by them men unskilfull and unlearned who simply beleeving doe rest in the understanding of their betters but that the asses are said to feed with the oxen because the more simple and dull who are not capable of high points meant by the asses conversing with the prudent meant by the oxen are fed with their knowledge or understanding


xiii
to these few and weake authorities many pregnant testimonies of the fathers might be opposed if it were needfull
these few may suffice


hilarie

nec enim quisquam quod non sapit loquitur nec quod loqui non potest potest credere
neither doth any man speake what he doth not conceive neither can he beleeve that which he is not able to utter


hierome

quae est ista simplicitas nescire quae credas what sillinesse is this not to know the things which thou doest beleeve


chrysostome

having recited very many heads of christian religion all these saith hee and many more a christian must know and of all these hee must bee able to render a reason to them that aske it


augustine

although no man can beleeve in god unlesse hee understand somewhat concerning god notwithstanding by that faith it selfe whereby he doth beleeve he is healed that hee may understand greater understanding therefore proficit ad intelligenda qua credat fides proficit ad credenda quae intelligat eadem ipsa ut magis magisque intelligantur in ipso intellectu profioit mens profiteth or is a proficient to understand what it may beleeve and our faith profiteth to

beleeve those things which it may understand and that the same things may more and more bee understood in the understanding it selfe the minde profiteth


cyril

faith what is it else but the true knowledge of god


in the second tome of athanasius

there is a discourse against those who bidding men not to search the scriptures but to content with that faith which is among themselves which is the very case of the papists at this day shall

saith the author of that discourse neglect the scriptures whence then shall have knowledge shall abandon knowledge whence then shall have faith paul cryeth out how shall they beleeve if they doe not heae and againe fath is by hearing and hearing by the word of god therefore he that forbiddeth the word

stoppeth up hearing and expelleth faith
but saith hee a little after they who goe about to establish their owne opinions restraine men from the scriptures in pretence that they would not have them to be so bold to have accesse to them which are unacce ible but in very truth

that they may avoid the conutation of their wicked doctrine out of them



fulgentius fides vera quod credit non nescit etiamsi nondum potest videre quod iper at credit
true faith is not ignorant of that which it beleeveth although as yet it is not able to see that which it doth hope and beleeve


the master of the sentences fides non potest esse de eo quod omnino

ignoratur
faith cannot be of that whereof a man is altogether can a man beleeve in god unlesse hee understand somwhat seeing faith commeth by hearing the word preached
nec a quae prus creduntur quàm intelliguntur penitus ignorantur cum fides sit ex auditu
ignorantur tamen ex parte quia non sciuntur
neither are those things which are beleeved before they bee understood altogether unknowne seeing faith commeth of hearing yet in part men are ignorant of them because they have not the science of them


to these wee may adde the authority of the creed it selfe that is as the papists themselves doe teach of all the apostles consenting together wherein they thought it not sufficient to teach men to professe their beleefe in that one article beleeve the holy catholike church but in all necessary points that are to bee beleeved· first concerning god both in himselfe and in his works in himselfe both in respect of the nature of the deity and of the three persons in trinity the father the sonne and the holy ghost in his workes of creation and government and of redemption
then concerning the church and the severall prerogatives thereof viz the communion of saints the forgivenesse of sinnes the resurrection of the body and life everlasting and further teach every particular christian to say and that with christian resolution credo beleeve these particulars which cannot be done either with truth if indeed he doe not beleeve each particular or with that undefined span alphabet or confidence which is meet unlesse a man doth not onely beleeve all those particulars but also knowe that hee

doth beleeve them
and lastly by this forme of profession beleeve they teach and confirme that of habac


that the just shall live by his owne faith and not by the faith of others


xiv
now come to bellarmines reason although have already

answered it in part
in him that beleeveth saith he there are two things apprehension and judgement or assent
apprehension goeth before faith and is not knowledge unlesse it be distinct and plaine and that is not needefull to faith
now the judgement or assent saith he is twofold for either it followeth reason and the evidence of the thing and is called knowledge or else the authority of the prpounder and is called faith
therefore saith he the mysteries of faith which surpasse reason we doe beleeve we doe not understand
and therefore faith is distinguished against science and is better defined by ignorance than by knowledge
answ
this discourse is to prove that faith may be without knowledge for whereas two things concurre to faith apprehension and assent knowledge is required in neither
but answere that these things are not well distinguished by bellarmine
for first apprehension or conceiving of the object is the common act of the understanding going before all judgement of the understanding

whatsoever
for it is not possible that the understanding should judge of that which it hath not apprehended or conceived
and yet behold implicite faith is so farre from being a true justifying faith that it hath not so much as this first and common act of the understanding in it
for it doth not so much as apprehend or conceive the particular things to be beleeved· secondly judgement and assent are not to bee confounded

for judgement is more generall and belongeth to those things that wee doe not assent unto as well as to those which wee doe
for when wee have in our mind apprehended conceived or understood any proposition or thing propounded then wee judge of it either as false and then wee dissent from it or as doubtfull and then wee withhold our assent and suspend our judgement

or as true and then wee assent to it
but this assent thirdly is not to be confounded with faith because it is more generall
for either we assent to a proposition faintly imagining that perhaps it may be otherwise as in contingent propositions which so are true as that they may bee false
and then our judgement of them and assent to them is called opinion or wee assent firmely as being perswaded that it cannot be otherwise and this is called knowledge now a man knoweth a proposition to be true and is assured that it cannot be otherwise being perswaded thereunto either by the evidence of the thing or by the infallible authority of the propounder
of the thing being either manifest in it selfe to sense and experience or to reason and then it is called undefined span alphabet or intelligentia whereby without discourse men know things so to be which is noeticall or axiomaicall judgement of a proposition in it selfe manifest or else manifested by discourse as of questions syllogistically concluded and this judgment or knowledg is called undefined span alphabet which is the science of conclusions which we know cannot possibly be false the premisses being true
but when a thing is neither

manifest in it selfe to sense or reason nor manifested by discourse and yet we doe know and are undoubtedly perswaded of the necessary and infallible truth thereof moved theunto by the divine authority of the propounder which is the spirit of truth that is called faith which is as you heard out of basil undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet an undoubted assent or full perswasion or assurance eui falsum subesse non potest the subject whereof cannot be false
where fourthly you see indeed that faith is distinguished against science and evident intelligence but as a speciall under the same generall which is notitia knowledge
and therefore the mysteries of saith which surpasse our reason though we doe not understand them by that knowledge which is of propositions either manifst in themselves or manifested by discourse yet wee know them to be undoubtedly true because of the authority of the propounder knowing

whom we doe beleeve
and therefore fifthly very absurd was he who said that faith may better be defined by ignorance than by knowledge

xv
thus have wee seene the salshood of the popish doctrine concerning implicite faith now let us shew the wickednesse of it

which consisteth in this that it is an horrible couzenage of the people to their perdition
here therefore two things are to bee shewed first that it is an egregious imposture and couzenage
secondly that it is extremely pernicious to the people
their cozenage stands in this that when they say that the faith required iu a lay man as sufficient to his justification is to beleeve or rather to professe himselfe to beleeve

whatsoever the catholike church beleeveth though in particular he know not what the church beleeveth their meaning is that the church of rome and therein the pope is not onely the whole materill object but also the formall object of their faith
say the whole materiall object
for they teach

that whatsoever is to bee beleeved is reduced to this one article of the creed beleeve the holy catholike church and that this faith is a more faith than if a man should say beleeve the whole scriptures
for hee that beleeveth the catholike church beleevth whatsoever the catholike church propoundeth to be beleeved
now their church propoundeth to be beleeved not onely tho whole written word both apocryphall and canonicall but the unwritten also which are the traditions of the church
they make the church also the formall object of saith not onely which wee beleeve but also for which beleeve whatsoever is to bee beleeved and so make the church to be the rule and the principium or principle of their faith
these are the grounds of their imposture
but their cozenage especially consisteth in this· that whatsoever excellencie they ascribe to the catholike church that they attribute wholly and onely to the church of rome and therein to the pope
for ths they expound that article in their new creed

beleeve the holy catholike apostolicall church of rome the mother and mistris of all other churches out of which there is no salvation
so excluding from salvation all those that have beene are or shall bee who live not

in communion with and subjection to the church and pope of rome
this is the principall nt whereby the greatest number of silly soules are cony ch'd


xvi
no doubt the apostle by catholike understood the vniversall and not any particular church fuch as the church of rome which was not then extant when the creed was made as themselves doe each
and thereore the apostles themselves when they made the creed were not of that church
and by holy vniversall church being an object of faith and therefore not seene they understand the universall company of the elect which is the body of christ containing not onely the militant church but also the triumphant and not onely the church after the ascion of christ but also before from the beginning of the world
and not onely those who were or are under the pope but also hose who never acknowledged any subjection to the see of rome such as were the churches under the other foure patriares of constantinople alexandria antioch and ierusalem and such as are the greatest part of christ at this day
but if by vniversall must be meant particular and if by catholike must be understood romane then by their doctrine from the company of them that are and shall be saved are excluded first the church triumphant secondly the church which was from the beginning untill the church of rome was pland thirdly the foure churches and others which acknowledged no subjection to the see of rome in which were many holy martyr and the most of the godly and learned fathers
in all which time the bishop of rome was at the most but a patriarch as others were untill that barbarous tyrat in the yeare of our lord
made him vniversall bishop and head of the vniversall church the proper tit of antichrist fourthly all those churches which since that time and at this day acknowledg subjection to the pope as their head which is the greater and better part of christendome
now what a is this to perswade men that there is no salvation for those who doe not acknowledge the pope to be their head that is who are not limmes and members of antichrist especially when the scriptures teach that antichrist prevail in them

onely that perish


xvii
but although this be a grand imposture as a right reverend learned man hath shewed to teach men to beleeve that the church of rome alone is the catholike church out of which noe can be saved· yet this is but halfe of their cozenage
for article of the church they expound as if it were not beleeve that there is a church as when it is said
beleeve the commion of saints there mission of nnes but as if it were said eredo ecolsia rather in ecclesiam
beleeve the church or in the church as that which cannot and consequently beleeve whatsoer the church teacheth or propoundeth to be beleeved making th church formall object of their faith and principall rule or principle into which their faith is

last resolved for which they give credit to the scriptures themselves which receive their credit and authority from the church
now by this church they meane not the universall company of catholikes for they are compared to iobs

asses but the prelates of the church of rome and among them the pope who virtually is the church in whom alone the prerogative of not erring resideth
for a generall or oecumenicall counsell which is the whole church representative they say without the pope may erre but the pope himselfe alone without a councell cannot erre
and therefore the authority of a generall councell and of the pope together

is no more than of the pope alone
it is the pope therefore alone that cannot erre who hath an heavenly and infallible judgement who is the supreame iudge in all controversies the chiefe and onely authenticall interpreter of the scriptures so that no point of religion is to be held for truth but what he determineth no text of scripture to be held the word of god in any other sense than hee holdeth yea that a text of scripture urged against them in another sense than he holdeth is not the word of god

but rather of the devill
by which meanes the pope is stept into the roome of christ and and is undoubtedly become antichrist
so that the implicite faith of the papists whereby they professe themselves to beleeve what is propounded by the church meaning especially the see of rome that is to say the pope to be beleeved and consequently whereby they professe themselves to beleeve in the pope as the principall rule principle and foundation of their faith is the very character and marke of the beast whereby men are branded to destruction


xviii
the which doth also prove the other point viz how pernicious the doctrine of implicite faith is as tending to the perdition of the seduced people which will also prove by other reasons
for under the name of implicite faith they commend unto the laity damnable ignorance that having blindfolded them they may lead them as it were by the nose whither it pleaseth them
to them it is sufficient to beleeve what the church beleeveth though they know little or nothing of the churches beleefe
if one

of them be called before the commissioners hee shall say enough and defend himselfe sufficiently when he answereth that he is a catholike and that he will live and dye in that faith which the catholike church doth teach and that this church can give them a reason of all those things which they demand
and thus according to christs promise luk

the holy ghost for sooth teacheth

every unlearned catholike to give sufficient reason of his faith
but it is evident that those who live in ignorance doe live in a state of damnation or as the scripture speaketh

doe sit in darkenesse and in the shadow of death
first because they live without god

as it were atheists in this world
for they that know not god have not god
secondly because they are void of all grace whereby they might hope to be saved
for knowledge being the first of all graces where that is wanting all the rest are absent
againe without faith there is no saving grace for faith is the mother and roote

of all other graces and without knowledge there is no faith as have already shewed
for how can they beleeve in him of whom they have

not heard and by hearing knowne knowledge is as it were the first step towards faith and all other graces and therefore he that hath not that in some measure hath not made one steppe in the way that leadeth to eternall life
thirdly because they are not christs sheepe nor gods children
for saith our saviour know mine and am knowne of mine ioh

they shall know me every one of them saith the lord from the greatest to the least of them ier

all gods children shall be taught of god esai

ioh

every one therefore that hath heard and learned of the father commeth to mee saith our saviour and none else
all gods children have the unction from the holy one and they know all needfull things ioh


ioh

fourthly because it hath all the respects of evill in it
for it is not one ly a sinne but the cause of all sinne and errour a punishment and the cause of punishment both in this life and in the world to come
a sinne repoved and condemned ier

and to eternall damnation

if our gospell bee hid saith the apostle it is hid to them that perish cor

for if it bee eternall life

qui ea qu sunt domini nesciunt a domino nesciuntur saith gregory

paulo attestante qui ait si quis autem ignorat ignorabitur
the councell of rhemes

denyeth that they can bee saved who doe not understand the creed and the lords prayer
and againe

no man can bee saved without faith and no man can beleeve that which he doth not know nor hath heard

xix
all this notwithstanding the popish impostors detaine the people in ignorance they have taken away the key

of knowledge and shut up

the kingdome of heaven against their followers for neither they goe in themselves neither suffer them

that faine would enter to goe in
they forbid them to reade the scriptures which are able to make them wise to salvation tim


which our saviour therefore commandeth them to search ioh

they suffer them not to heare them nor yet the divine service otherwise than in an unknowen tongue contrary to the rule of the apostle cor
and wherefore all this partly that their errours and abominations should not be seene for he that evill doeth hateth the light and as theeves by night wish the light of gods word to bee put out or at least to bee hid under a bushell and partly that they may bee lords over the peoples faith and may make them beleeve what they list that they may rule them at their pleasure that they may lead them whither they please
for hee that walketh in darkenesse knoweth

not whither he goeth may as easily bee led up and downe as sampson

after his eyes were put out
but those that are of god doe wish that the people of god may increase in knowledge of god thes

that they may be perfect in understanding cor

that they may abound more and more in knowledge phil


for not to be proficients in knowledge they esteeme a great fault
heb

tim


that the word of christ may dwell in them richly in all wisedome col



that they may bee able and ready to give an answere to every man that asketh a reason of that hope that is in them pet


for where men of all other professions can give a reason of that which they doe professe it is a great absurdity as chrysostome

testifieth for a man professing himselfe a christian not to bee able to give an account of his faith that they may trye all things and hold fast that which is good thes

that husbands may be able to instruct their wives

and housholders their families deut



yea moses the man of god wished that all the lords people were prophets num



xx
and as the godly have wished so the lord hath promised

that in the church of christ there should bee plenty of knowledge esa

ier

and that all the faithfull should bee taught of god esai

and this was verified in times past in the primitive churches and is at this day in all true churches and where it is not in some measure verified as it is not in the church of rome that is not a true church
not to speake of the present times will produce one testimony of the ancient churches
in which it was usuall to bee seene

that the points of christian religion were knowne not onely to the teachers of the church but also to all manner of artificers and handicrafts

men of women likewise not onely such as were lettered but those of the meanest sort even servants and handmaids and not onely citizens but also countrey people as and laborers had this knowledge who might bee found conferring of the divine trinity of the creation of all things and having better knowledge of the nature of man than plato or aristtle

finally the papists by their doctrine of implicite faith do bereave the faithfull of their chiefe rejoycing
for thus saith the lord

let not the

wise man glory in his wisedome neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth mee that am the lord which exercise loving kindnesse judgement and righteousnesse in the earth for in these things delight saith the lord
so much of the first question

cap ii
prving that a true justifying faith cannot bee severed from charity and other graces

the second question concerning the nature of faith is whether a true justifying faith may be severed from charity and from all other graces of sanctification
the papists hold the affirmative we the negative
the reasons of our assertion that true justifying faith is ever accompanied with charity and other graces and cannot indeed be severed from them are manifold and manifest

my first reason is this all that are regenerate and borne of god

have charity and other graces of sanctification

all that truly beleeve in christ or which is all one that have a true justifying faith are regenerate and borne of god
therefore all that truely beleeve in christ have charity and other graces of sanctification
the proposition is thus proved
regeneration consisteth in the infusion of graces of sanctification and therfore they who are regenerate are indued with those graces
seondly regeneration is the renewing of a man according to the image of god in true holinesse and righteousnesse ephes


both which are comprehended in charity
the former being the love of god the other of our neighbour
thirdly the papists themselves doe teach that when men are regenerated in baptisme there is with faith infused charity
fourthly as he that hath charity is borne of god and knoweth him so he that hath not charity knoweth not god and much lesse is borne of him
ioh


the assumption all that have a true justifying faith are regenerate and borne of god
for first whosoever beleeveth that vs is the christ is bome of god ioh


secondly as many as receive

christ by faith to them he gave this undefined span alphabet this priviledge or prerogatiye to be the sonnes of god even to them that beleeve on his name who are borne not of bloud nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
ioh


thirdly all that doe truely beleeve are the children of god by faith in christ iesus
gal


fourthly faith is a grace of regeneration which the holy ghost doth ingenerate and infuse when hee doth regenerate as the papists themselves confesse
neither is it of nature or from our selves but it is the speciall gift of god ephes
for no man can truly say that is with a lively and unfained assent of the heart that iesus is the lord but by the holy ghost cor

to beleeve that iesus is the christ the sonne of the living god flesh and bloud hath not revealed to any man but god the father who is in heaven matth


no man saith our saviour can come to me that is beleeve in me ioh

except the father who hath sent me draw him iohn

and except it be given unto him by my father vers
and how given as a proper fruit of election
for justifying faith is the faith of the elect

given unto us when we are called according to the purpose of god and his grace given unto us in christ before all secular times tim


for those whom god giveth to christ by election they come unto him by faith ioh

and so many as are ordained to eternall life beleeve act




ii
secondly whosoeverhave the spirit of christ dwelling in them

are udued with charity and other graces which all are the fruits

of the spirit
who is the spirit of

grace and contrarywise they who have not charity have not the spirit of christ
for the spirit of christ is the spirit of love god is love and he that abideth in love dwelleth in god and god in him ioh

but he that loveth not knoweth not god and much lesse dwelleth in him vers

all that have true faith have the spirit

of christ dwelling in them by which christ dwelleth in them and those which have not the spirit of christ are none of his rom
faith is the proper worke of the spirit who is therefore called the sprit of faith cor

and therfore those who are endued with true faith

have the spirit by both which christ dwelleth in us
againe all that are the sonnes of od have the spirit of christ gal


all that truly beleeve are the sonnes

of god as hath been shewed
all that be christs they have his spirit for those that have not his spirit are none of his rom

all that truely beleeve are christs cor

both because god hath given them unto him iohn



and because he hath bought them with a great price cor

and because by faith they are engrafted and united unto him as his members

therefore all that have true faith are endued with charity and other graces


iii
thirdly all that are sanctified are endued with charity and

other graces for in them our sanctification doth consist

all that have true faith are sanctified
for first by faith the heart is

purified acts

and true faith worketh by love galathians


secondly because all that are justified are also sanctified
all that have a true faith are justified therefore all that have a true faith are sanctified
the proposition can in no sort be denied by the papists who confound justification and sanctification
but though they must necessarily be distinguished yet they may not they cannot be severed
they are such unseparablecompanions that whosoever hath the one hath the other and whosoever hath not both hath neither whosoever is in christ as all the faithfull are is a new creature cor

he liveth not after the flesh but after the spirit rom

he crucifieh the flesh with the lusts thereof gal


this truth is confirmed by the oth of god whereby he hath promised in the covenant of grace

that to all the faithfull the sonnes of abraham he will give them redemption and justification and being redeemed hee will give them grace to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of their life
those therefore whom god doth justifie by faith he doth sanctifie by his spirit

but all that have a true justifying faith are justified and by their justification have right or are entituled to the kingdome of heaven act


yea the gospell teacheth not onely that they which truely beleeve shall bee saved but also that they are translated from death to life and that they have eternall life
ioh



ioh




iv
fourthly all true disciples of christ are endued with charity
ioh

all that truly beleeve in christ are his true disciples therefore fifthly that which worketh by charity is not without it true faith worketh by charity gal


sixthly the formed faith is not severed from charity as the papists themselves teach
true justifying faith is the formed faith for that which is without forme is neither atrue nor justifying but a dead and counterfeit faith
seventhly if faith without charity doe not justifie then a true justifying faith is not without charity
but the former is true for that faith which is without charity profiteth nothing cor

therefore the later

eighthly out of iohn

hee that beleeveth knoweth god they that love not know not god ergo they that love not beleeve not



to these eight arguments wee will adde seven more out of the epistle of iames chapter
beginning at the
verse where he doth not goe about to prove that a true justifying faith doth not justifie alone but that that faith which is alone without charity without good workes doth neither justifie alone nor at all
and that hee proveth by these reasons first verse
true faith doth justifie and save a man that faith which is in profession onely being void of charity or as saint iames speaketh when a man saith he hat faith and hath not workes doth not justifie or save a man and therefore is not a true faith

secondly pari verse
charity which is onely in words

and profession and not indeed and

truth is unprofitable and vaine so pari ratione faith which is onely in profession being alone void of charity and of good workes is dead

thirdly verse
true faith may be demonstrated by good workes but that faith which is in profession onely and void of charity cannot be demonstrated by good workes therefore it is not a true faith

fourthly ver
that faith which is common to devils is no true justifying faith for they beleeve that which they abhorre whereupon augustine

saith fides· christiani cum dilectione est daemonis autem sine dilectione

fifthly vers
the dead faith of a vaine man is not a justifying faith that faith which is without charity is the dead faith of a vaine man therefore not a justifying faith
sixthly ver



true justifying faith is such a faith as was that of abrham or at least as was that of rahab that is fruitfull of good workes but that which is without charity and without good workes is not such a faith as that of abraham or of rahab
seventhly· vers
simili as the body without spirit is dead so that faith which is without good workes is dead
vpon these arguments of saint iames it doth inevitably follow that seeing that faith which is severed from charity and destitute of good workes is not a true justifying faith therefore a true justifying faith is not severed from charity nor destitute of good workes


vi
these fifteene arguments are as suppose without exception

those which bellarmine thought he could best answere hee hath propounded as our best arguments and cavilled with them they are in number six the first out of tim


that for want whereof a man declareth himselfe to be without true faith and to be worse than an infidell cannot be separated from a true faith

for want of charity yea for want of one branch thereof which is to provide for a mans owne especially those of his owne house whom the very insidels are wont to provide for a man declareth himselfe to be without true faith that is in saint paules phrase hath denyed the faith and is worse than an infidell in that particular therefore charity cannot be separated from true faith

to this bellarmine frameth an answere against himselfe that as chrysostome and other interpreters doe witnesse the apostle speaketh of such who are said to deny the faith because they doe not live as faith doth teach men to live as none doe who have not charity and therefore those who have not charity have not faith who as the same apostle saith

professe themselves to know god but in deeds deny him which also is against himselfe for how saith chrysostome can such a man be said to beleeve that denieth god therefore saith he the wicked deny the faith not in heart or mouth but indeed and of them saith he writeth saint gregory whose testimony he alleageth directly against himselfe

eos non veraciter credere non habere veram fidem quinon bene operantur that they doe not truely beleeve nor have a true faith who doe not worke

well
and therefore those that worke ill as those doe who are without charity and namely those who provide not for their domesticks shew that they have no true faith
but this he salveth with another testimony of the same gregory

that many enter into the church because they have faith and yet want the wedding garment because they have not charity
where by faith we are to understand the profession of faith which many make who have not charity
but by the wedding garment we are according to the scriptures to understand rather christ and his righteousnesse as have shewed heretofore put on by a true and lively faith for he that was without the wedding garment wanted faith as well as charity
the authour of the unfinished worke in chrysostome faith

nuptiale vestimentum est fides vera quae est per iesum christum justitiam ejus the wedding garment is the true faith which is by iesus christ and his righteousnesse
but will you heare one of their owne writers upon matth

what is saith he

that wedding garment· to wit that whereof paul speaketh when he saith

put on the lord iesus christ
this garment is inwardly put on by faith when thou puttest on

christs righteousnesse to cover thy sinnes


vii
the second out of ioh

iudas though he professed the faith is yet said not to have beleeved because he wanted charity and therefore they who want charity want faith
bellarmine answereth that he is said not to beleeve because at that time he had lost his faith
reply iudas though he professed the faith yet he never had true faith and therefore never lost it
for from the beginning iesus knew who they were that beleeved not and who should betray him for this cause saith he in the next verse

said unto you that no man can come to me that is beleeve in me vers
and
unlesse it be given unto him of my father which hee insinuateth had not been given to iudas whom from the beginning he knew to be no beleever


viii
hee that saith hee knoweth god namely by faith and

keepeth not his commandements is a lyar
bellarmine answereth that he speaketh of the knowledge of familiarity and friendship of which the lord speaketh to the wicked matth


know you not whereunto reply that if he speake of such knowledge it is the knowledge of faith and cannot be had but by faith and so the argument standeth in force
howbeit unfitly doth he alleage the lords not knowing of the wicked to prove the meaning of our knowing of him
if he speake not of the knowledge of faith the argument is the stronger for if he be a lyar that only saith that he knoweth god and keepeth not his commandements then much more is hee a lyar that saith hee knoweth god by faith and keepeth not his commandements
beda indeed expoundeth this knowledge of god of the love of god which is a fruit and consequent of our faith hocest deum nosse quod amare but others of faith as

gregory speaking of this place notitia quipp dei ad fide pertinet
oecumenius maketh this verse to bee of the same signification with the sixth verse of the first chapter
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walke

in darkenesse we are lyars and that which saint iohn there calleth undefined span alphabet communion here hee calleth undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet commixtion or conjunction
thus therefore hee saith saint iohn having said before that those which

beleeve in the lord have communion or fellowship with him here hee setteth downe evidences of our communion with him
in this wee know that wee know him undefined span alphabet for that which hee had said before

that wee have conjunction or communion with him if wee keepe his commandements
and this saith hee hee more fully sheweth by the contrary but hee that saith know him undefined span alphabet or have communion with him and keepeth not his commandements he is a lyar
this then is is meaning he that saith know god that is have communion with him by faith and doth not keepe his commandements hee is a lyar
but whether wee understand the words of communion by faith or of faith according to the usuall prase of the scriptures puting knowledge for faith as noted before

or of knowledge it selfe the argument is unanswerable
for if wee cannot truely bee said to know christ that is to beleeve in him unlesse wee keepe his commandements then it is evident that true faith cannot be severed from charity
for this is love if we keep his commandements ioh

againe if hee that saith hee knoweth god and keepeth not his commandemenes bee a lyar much more he that saith hee beleeveth in god and keepeth not his commandements is a lyar as said before
to this adde tit

which bellarmine cited against himselfe those that professe themselves to know god but in workes deny him they are undefined span alphabet unbeleevers ioh

or as the vulgar latine incredibiles or as thomas aquinas non apti ad credendum


ix fourthly ioh

every one that bleeveth that iesus is

the christ is borne of god and therefore undoubtedly hath charity
bellarmine answereth that he speaketh de fide formata as saint augustine

expoundeth and so doe wee for whosoever truely beleeveth hath fidem formatam
for the apostle no doubt speaketh of a true lively saith and such there is none but that which the papists call formatam which worketh by love
and therefore the argument holdeth that whosoever hath a true lively iustifying faith is borne of god or regenerated by the spirit of sanctification and therefore is undoubtedly endued with charity


fifthly iam
that faith which without workes is dead

a true lively justifying faith is not dead therefore true livly ustifying faith is not without works
bellarmine saith he hath explaned this in his third argument

that faith is said to be dead not as a is said to bee dead who after death is not but as a body is said to bee dead which after death is but liveth not
for saith he life is not of the essence of faith as it of the essence of a man but by a metaphor saith is said to live when it worketh and to bee dead whe it worketh not
even as water is said to bee living which continually floweth as in fontaines and rivers dd which moveth not as in standing pooles and yet both is truely and properly water
whereunto reply that

the body of a man being dead is a true body in respect of the generall nature of a body both because it consisteth of three dimensions as all true bodies doe and because it consisteth of all the elements as all perfectly compounded bodies doe
but wheras bodies perfectly compounded are subdivided in corpor a in animata animata the dead body of a man or of a beast or of a plant is not a true body in genere ani no more than the severall parts thereof as the eye the care because it is deprived of his forme which is the anima thereof according to his kind
so faith which is dead may in respect of the generall nature of faith bee called a true faith because it is an assent to the truth revealed by god yet whereas assent is either forced or voluntary and that either to the law which is the legall or to the gospell which is the evangelicall faith and this either unfained lively and effectuall or counterfeit idle and uneffectuall therefore the dead faith being either not voluntary such as is in the devils and some wicked men who beleeve that which they abhorre or not evangelicall as in the iewes or not unfained lively and effectuall as in hypocrites and unsound christians is not a true justifying faith because it wanteth the forme and as it were the anima of a true justifying faith which is the inward integrity for that is actus primus the inward undefined span alphabet or efficacie thereof whereby it doth effectually receive that is apprehend and apply christ to the beleever

it is true that by a metaphor taken from men faith is said to be either alive or dead though herein is a dissimilitude because a man is said to be dead who before had lived bufaith is onely said to be dead not because it ever had lived but because it is without life as many things also are by a metaphore said to bee dead blind or dumbe which never did live see or speak
but saith he faith is said to be alive when it worketh and dead when it worketh not
ad rather say it is alive when it is operative and energetical though it do not alwaies actually work as in sleep and dead when it is idle uneffectuall and unprofitable
but this is nothing to our argument for if faith without charity or without workes bee said to bee dead then a true lively justifying faith cannot be without charity or good workes and that which is is not a true justifying faith no more than a dead man is a man and yet as a dead which is but a carcase is called by the name of that man whose carcase it is even so dead faith which is but a carcase or rather a counterfeit of faith is called faith not properly and truely but


xi
that faith by which a righteous man shall live is not without

charity

by a true justifying faith a righteous man shall live
therefore a true justifying faith is not without charity

to the assumption bellmine answereth two wayes
first that a righteos man is said to live by faith because by faith which is the substance of things hoped for he patiently supporteth himselfe in expectation of eternall life
to which reply that the words are the just shall live and that the apostle more than once alleadgeth that testimony in the question

of justification as rom

gal

to prove that by faith a man is justified that is entituled to eternall life
secondly hee answereth that the prophet speaketh of fides formata per charitatem such as is in the just who by such a faith as worketh by love doe live a spirituall life which answere maketh wholly for us
for if the true faith whereby the just man shall live is formed by charity as the papists speake and worketh by charity as saint paul saith then it followeth that the true justifying faith is never severed from charity


xii
to these arguments grounded on the holy scriptures

will adjoyne some testimonies of the father
chrysostome

so soone as you beleeved you brought forth good faith in it owne nature is full of good wors and so cleens alex strom
that faith is undefined span alphabet the worker of good things undefined span alphabet and the foundation of just working
augustine inseparabilis est bona vita fide qa per dilectionem operatur mo verò a ipsaest bona vita a good life cannot be severed from faith which worketh by love yea it selfe is a good life

fides christiani saith he cum dilectione est dmonis autem sie dilectione

and accordingly he calleth fith without workes the faith not of christians but of devils againe to beleeve in christ it is not this to have the faith of devils which worthily is esteemed to bee dead but to have that faith which worketh by love
and so he and some others expound that phrase of beleeving in christ

ille eim credit in christm

qui sper at in christum diligi christ
nam credere in christum est credndo amare
in christum credere est amando in ipsum tendere
pifides sie spe charitate esse non vult
si fidem habt sine spe dilectione christum esse credit non in christum credit

isidorus pelusita

undefined span alphabet
neither doe thou thinke that faith if that ought to be called faith which is convinced or reproved by thine own work cn save thee

oecumenius

that faith accreweth not to an uncleane person undefined span alphabet
meane a true faith who will deny for neither may ointment bee put up into a vessell full of filth neither

can the faith of god bee ingendred in an uncleane man

gregory

as we heard before denyeth them truely to beleeve or to have a true faith who doe not live well
for tht is true faith saith

which that which it saith in words it doth not gainesay in manners hence it is that paul speaketh of certaine falsis fidelibs falsly called faithfull men who confesse

that they know god but in deeds deny him
hence iohn saith he that saith hee knoweth god and doth not the which seeing it is so wee ought to acknowledge the truth of our faith in consideration of our life
for then are we truely faithfull if what wee promise in words wee performe in a man after baptisme keepe hat which he promised before baptisme let him now being certaine that he is faithfull rjoyce where observe that those are faithfull not that are baptized but that keep their vow of baptism and that those that live wickedly are falsi fideles falsly called faithfull

againe qantum credis tantum amamus

anslm fides qu non habet charita opera bona fids dmonum est non christianorum
faith which hath not charity and good worke is the faith of divels not of christians
and againe

fides sine operibus no est vera fides

bernard

faith maketh a true catholike not that which common to devils and men but that which is common to men and angelicall spirits and which is that that which worketh by love

many of the princes or rulers beleeved in christ but they did not confess for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of god
her saith ee the evangelist testifieth that in these princes there was faith without charity
his reason is thus to be framed

the princes which did not confesse christ were void of charity the same princes beleeve in christ
therefore some that beleeve in christ are void of charity

the proposition is proved because they loved the glory or praise of men more than of god
answ
if they did absolutely and altogether preferre the glory of men before the glory of god then hd they neither love of god nor faith in christ see ioh

but if by force of temptation or by humane frailty as ferefulnesse

and too much love of the world which are corruptions incident to the best they were for a time hindered from professing christ dare not say they were void of charity
for saint peter when he both loved christ and beleeved in him did deny him which was worse than not confessing him
and it may be that among those rulers were reckoned nicodemus and ioseph of arimatha who though they had not for time openly professed christ yet when there was greatest cause of feare and of doubt and least encouragement to professe him they express their love towards him ioh

to the assumption aswere those princes who being void of charity loved the glory of men more than the glory of god by the testimony of christ neither did nor could beleeve ioh

neither did all they truely beleeve in christ who

in the scriptures are said after a sort to have beleeved in him for ioh

many are said to have belved in his name to whom our saviour would not undefined span alphabet concredit himselfe because hee knew what was in them vers



ii
his second proofe is out of cor

if had all faith so

that could remove mountaines and have not charity am nothing
therefore faith may bee severed from charity
answ
this place is either generally understood of all faith or particularly of the whole faith of working miracles but in neither sense doth it favour the popish sancie
if generally then the apostle must bee understood as speaking undefined span alphabet by way of supposition and not as positively affirming that either he or any other having all faith wanted charity therefore this supposition qu nihil ponit proveth nothing
yea in suppositions and fained comparisons a man may suppose things incredible and impossible and much more improbable as in this place it selfe if should speake with the tongues of men and angels and have not love if had all faith so that could remove mountaines and have not love and though bestow all my goods as it were by

morsels to free the poore and though gave my body to be burnt and have not charity and yet those suppositions whether improbable or incredible are of no lesse force in arguing than if they were absolutely true
indeed if the adversary could from this hypotheticall proposition truly assume the antecedent as he cannot then might hee urge this place to some purpose but if it may more truely be denied or taken away as for example if or any other had all faith and yet had not love as nver man yet had then is this allegation to no purpose
to this bellarmine replyeth that the apostle doth not argue from a condition impossible but usth an hyperbolt when notwithstanding it is most evident that the apostle speaketh not in a simple hyperbolicall speech as bellarmine maketh him but undefined span alphabet if had which have not but this supposall or fiction of a condition incredible doth no lesse prove the necessity of charity than if it were absolutely true

if the place be understood particularly of the faith of miracles the particle all being not universall but integrall as if it had beene said the whole faith including all the degrees of it which is very probable not onely in respect of the authority of the fathers heretofore mentioned but also by the words themselves first because he saith undefined span alphabet as speaking of a particular secondly because hee doth instance in a high degree of that particular so that could remove mountaines then this alegation is impertinent
for the question is not of the faith of miracles whether it may be severed from charity which we confesse but of the true justifying faith which not all they have who have the faith of miracles
for that hath beene bestowed upon iudas and other reprobates matth




which plainely overthroweth bellarmines conceit that the faith of miracles is the same with jstifying faith but excelling which is false in two respects for first it would then follow that all they who have had this faith should have beene endued with

justifying faith and that all who have excelled in the greatest measure and degree of justifying faith should have beene adorned with the faith of miracles
both which are untrue
secondly the schoole men when they distinguish grace into gratia grtum which is the justifying and sanctifying grace tending to the good and salvation of the party who hath it and gratia gratis data tending to the good of others the faith of working miracles is reckoned in the later ranke corinthians




iii
yea but it is promised mark


that signes should follow

them that beleeve namely by a justifying faith whereof is mention vers
but not say that all beleevers should be workers of miracles but some for all
from whence nothing can be proved but that to some which did beleeve the gift of working miracles should bee granted for the confirmation of the faith

yea but by saith in forr times the faithfull stopped the mouths of lyons quenched the violence of fire heb


answ
these examples recorded in the scriptures were not wrought by the faithfull themselves but the lord because they id beleeve and trust in him sent his angell to stoppe the mouths of lions dan



and to quench the violence of fire dan



howbeit if themselves had wrought these miracles it would prove no more but that some who had justifying faith had also the faith of working miracles

neither doth our saviour luk
say that if a man had the justifying faith like a graine of mustard seed hee should be able to remoove mountaines for those who have had a great and a strong faith as namely abraham have had no such power
yea but he speaketh of that faith which the disciples pried him to increase luk

but say if you compare the place with his parallell matth


it will appeare that both our saviour and his apostle speake of the faith of miracles
for when our saviour reproved them for their want of faith in that they were not able to cure the lunaticke who notwithstanding were endued with justifying faith as many others are who though they have a strong faith yet are not able to worke such a cue they desire our saviour to increase or as the word is

adde unto them faith whereupon our saviour returneth this answeare if you had faith as a graine of mustard seed doth hee meane justifying faith god forbid for then no man living could bee said to have so much of justifying faith as is a graine of mustard seed


iv
and whereas in the last place hee would prove by the conjunction

of these three faith hope and charity verse
that hee speaketh of the same faith whereof he had spoken verse
answere first that it followeth not for here the apostle maketh a new comparison of of charity with faith and hope preferring it before them as greater both in respect of the breadth or for whereas the benefit of faith and hope respecteth habentem him that hath them charity is extended to others and also in respect of the length or continuance
for whereas faith and hope doe cease in the life to come faith being

swallowed up in vision and hope in fruition love neverthelesse is continued with increase

secondly this place maketh rather against him
now saith the apostle that is during this life these three abide none of them failing altogether in this life and therefore they alwayes goe together insomuch that whosoever hath any one of them hath alo the other two
no man can have love or hope unlesse he have faith and no man hath true saith but he hath both love and hope and according to the measure of his faith such is the measure both of his love and of his hope
for as that of

gregory is most true quantum credimus antum amamus so it is no lesse true quantum credimus tantum speramus
as for his allegation out of augustine

affirming that faith may be without charity deny not but that the faith of hypocrites which beareth the name of faith as a carcase or counterfeit do of the man whose they are is without charity but profiteth not
but that justifying faith may be without charity he saith not for how can it bee a justifying faith and not profit



his third testimony is ia


where saith he saint

iames not onely teacheth but also proveth that faith without workes doth not justific and that it may be without workes

we answer that hee doth not speake of a true justifying faith but of faith professed onely or of the profession of faith which proved before

and this appeareth vers
where the question disputed in that discourse is propounded
what doth it profit my brethren if a man shall say that hee hath faith or professeth himselfe to beleeve and hath not workes can undefined span alphabet that faith of his which is in profession onely and without workes save him or justifie him no by no meanes for this affirmative interrogation is a most emphaticall negation
this place therfore prooveth the contrary viz that faith which is wihout workes is not a true justifying faith and therefore a true justifying faith cannot be without workes

but that saint iames speaketh of a true faith bellarmine endevoureth to prove by five reasons against the maine drift of the apostle in that place which as shewed before was to prove that such a faith as is without workes is not a true justifying faith
his first reason is because saint iames calleth it absolutely faith which name in the scriptures alwyes signifieth the true faith that is or else hee speaketh to no purpose the true justifying faith
first answer that saint iames verse
doth not absolutely call it faith for he doth not say if a man have faith meaning a true faith but if a man shall say that hee hath faith can that faith which is in profession only save him and so in the verses following the faith which hee impleadeth doth not signifie the habi of true faith but the bare profession of faith
but doth this word faith alwaies in the scriptures fignifie the true justifying faith nothing lesse for many times in the new testament and almost alwayes in the old faith is taken for fidelty or faithfulnesse as tit

sometimes for the doctrine of faith which is beleeved which the papists themselves call the catholike faith
as act


they obeyed the faith act

the doore of

faith rom

the analogie of faith sometimes the profession of faith as act


rom

and so as hereafter am to shew iam


and in this sence many are said to beleeve that is to have faith and are called fideles that is beleevers who onely professe the faith and are in their owne profession or opinion of others beleevers
so ioh




act



and in this sence all that professe the name of christ are called after his name christians and are termed fideles the faithfull not that all who are so called have the true justifying faith which is not of all

nor yet of all that are called but onely of the

elect
for among those who are called the faithfull there are many falsi fideles who are so falsly called as wee heard before out of

gregory sometimes for the faith of miracles

as cor



mat

mar

luk


secondly hee saith that saint iames in the same chapter speaking of the sme faith saith that abrahams faith wrought with his workes ans this is also contrary to the drift of saint iames who by this argument proveth the faith which is without workes to bee no true justifying faith because it is not the faith of abraham nor yet of raba

thirdly saint iames there concludeth yee see then that a man is justified by works and not by faith only but a faith which calvin calleth umbram fidei justifieth neither alone nor at all
ans
as said before out of ver
by faith we are here to understand faith professed or the profession of faith
and to be justified is here understood declarativè
now to declare a man before men to be justified before god two things are required the profession of the faith and a christian life answerable to his profession and thus faith professed cooperateth with workes to declare a man to bee justified
for neither works alone without the profession of the faith will doe it for workes without faith are dead

nor the profession of the faith without workes for such a profession is also dead but both must goe together

fourthly saith he this is proved by two comparisons which hee calleth examples
the former vers

which hee doth very sorrily expresse first saith he he compareth a man having faith without workes to him who seeing the poore wanting food and rayment is content with that knowledge and giveth them no almes
for even as it profiteth nothing the poore that the rich know their want although it be a most true knowledge unlesse according to that knowledge they bestow upon them necessaries so true faith nothing unlesse a man doe study and endeavour to live according to it
frigidè admodum dilutè
for where doth saint iames compare true faith to these rich mens idle knowledge but the comparison plainely standeth thus
as the profession of charity in giving good words to the poore that want food and raiment depart in peace be ye warmed and filled is vaine and unprofitable if men do not accordingly give them somewhat to supply their necessities so the profession of faith without workes is dead
as therefore that charity which is in word and not in deed as saint iohn speaketh

is counterfeit so that faith which is in profession only severed from good workes is counterfeit

and dead
secondly saith he saint iames compareth faith without works to a body without spirit which certainely is a true body though it be dead
answ this also is contrary to the intendment of saint iames who therefore poveth that faith which is without works to be no true justifying faith because it is dead
for the profession of faith without workes is like to a mans body that is without spirit yea but saith bellarmine a dead body is a true body and a dead faith is a true faith
answere as before
a dead carcase though it bee a true body in respect of his three dimensions and of his composition of the elements yet it is not the true originall body of a man for a man is a living creature no more than a dead branch or bough is a true member of a living tree


vi
his fourth argument is taken from those testimonies which teach that in the church there are both good and bad in the floore both wheate and chaffe in the net fishes both good and bad in the flocke sheepe and goats
his reason standeth thus

some in the church are wicked and void of charity and other graces but all in the church have faith therefore some that have faith are void of charity

answ
the assumption is most false for not all that professe faith who from thence are called fideles in opposition to infidels are endued with true justifying faith which is not of all

but of the elect neither be all of the church that be in it
ioh

non existimo quenquam ita desipere saith augustine

ut credat ad eccesiae pertinere unitatem eum qui non habet charitatem

but saith bellarmine if the wicked who are in the church did want trut faith then should they chiefly bee reprehended for their unbeleefe but they are reprehended non de amissione fidei sed de omissione operum not for the amission or losse of faith but for the omission of good workes
ans when their want of faith doth appeare

they are reprehended for it
but because that is many times hidden and we are in the judgement of charity to judg them faithfull who professe the faith untill the contrary appeare therfore hypocrites escape reprehension which open sinners do incur
bellarm conclusion that true justifying faith may in the same party concur with sin and that it may be found in sinners none deny but pharisaicall papists who hold themselves being after their fashion as namely by baptisme or absolution justified to be no sinners professing that there is no sin in them nor any thing that god can hate
and wheras bellarmine taketh it for granted that all in the church have faith and that none want it but such as have lost it as it is lost they say by every act of infidelity hereby is discovered the most pernicious doctrine of the church of rome whereby innumerable soules are nuzzled in ignorance infidelity and impenitencio to their utter ruine and perdition
for they teach that all that are baptized are ex opere operato justified by infusion of faith hope and charity in which estate they remaine untill they commit some mortall sinne then indeed they lose their

charity and their justification but they retaine their faith which was infused in baptisme and still are to be accounted faithfull men and women though they know nothing nor actually beleeve any thing unlesse to their baptisme be added popish education by which for the most part they are taught to beleeve as their church beleeveth that being the safest course which faith disposeth them to justification directing them after the losse of their charity wherein their justification consisted to seeke to the sacrament of penance that thereby they may recover their justification
once a yeere therefore they goe to their priest to him they formally confesse their grosser sinnes formally they professe themselves sorry for them the priest absolveth them from eternall punishment enjoyning them some petite penance whereby they are to satisfie for the temporall penalty which remaineth after their absolution from the eternall by the priests absolution they all stand actually justified the priest refusing none though in truth they neither have knowledge nor faith nor repentance or amendment of life nor any other grace without which for all their sacramentall justifications and other they have none they live and die in a most wofull state of damnation


vii
his fifth argument is taken from the proper nature of faith and

charitie for saith he if faith and charitie cannot be disjoyned either it is because one is of the nature of the other or else because one necessarily ariseth or springeth from the other but neither of these may be said therfore faith and charitie may be severed
ans
first deny the disjunctive proposition because a third thing may be added and that is this or because the spirit of grace or regeneration who is the author and efficient of both hath unseparably united them in one and the same subject wherein working the one that is faith with it and by it he worketh the other
as touching the assumption the former part that the one is not of the nature of the other it is denied by the the latter that the one doth not necessarily spring from the other by the true catholikes
for the papists hold that charitie is the forme of justifying faith without which it neither doth nor can justifie
and therefore they of all men ought to hold that justifying faith cannot be severed from charitie
for whereas bellarmine saith that charitie is but the outward forme of faith by which it worketh acknowledge no outward forme but of artificiall bodies
as for that which is principium motus by which any thing worketh it is the very undefined span alphabet the actus primus the proper forme whereby any thing as it is that which it is so it worketh and produceth his proper and naturall effects
and such is the unseparable coexistence of the forme and the thing formed that posita forma res ipsa ponatur sublata forma res ipsa
the papists therefore hold things repugnant and undefined span alphabet when they teach that charitie is the forme of justifying faith and yet that justifying faith may be severed from it
the second that the one doth not necessarily spring from the other we deny
for true faith doth necessarily and infallibly encline the beleever to love god and his neighbour

for gods sake
for that faith whereby we are perswaded of gods love to us in christ cannot but move and encline us to love god neither can we love god as good if we doe not first beleeve that hee is good
and such as is the measure of our faith concerning gods goodnesse to us such is the measure of our love to him
bellarmine consesseth that saith enclineth and disposeth a man to love but saith a disposition and inclination non cogit doth not compell a man but leaveth him free
as though there were no necessitie but of coaction or constraint


viii
that charitie doth necessarily follow faith as an unseparable

companion he saith we have no sound proofes and therefore are faine to illustrate it by certaine similitudes which he calleth examples
answ
whether we have any sound proofes or not referre the christian reader to the fifteene arguments which bellarmine tooke no notice of besides those sixe vindicated from his cavils
as for similitudes they were not brought to prove the point but to illustrate and to make it more plaine
as if should compare a regenerate soule to fire as christ did iohn baptist

to a burning and shining lampe might say which was luthers

similitude as in fire or rather if you please in the sunnebeames two things concurre light and heate and neither is without the other the beames of the sunne alwaies by their light producing heat so in the regenerate soule there are faith as the light and charitie as the heate and neither is without other because the spirit of regeneration as it were the sunne by shedding abroad the beames of gods love into our hearts that is by working in us faith by which we are perswaded of gods love towards us in christ inflameth our hearts with the love of god the beames of gods love reflecting from our soules some warmth of love towards god
to this bellarmin answereth that charitie in the scriptures is compared to fire answ
so it may in respect of the heate as faith also may in respect of the light as therefore in the fire concurreth both light and heate which cannot be severed so in the regenerate soule faith and love
bucers similitude was of a sicke man

who being desperately sicke if a physician shall assure him of health and much more if hee shall cure him by forgoing something that is most deare unto him cannot if hee beleeve so much but affect and love him so wee being desperately sicke of sinne and neare to death and damnation if the lord shall by giving his owne sonne not onely redeeme us from death but also entitle us to the kingdome of heaven wee cannot if wee bee truly perswaded hereof by faith but love god againe who hath so loved us
for we love god

because he first loved us
to this bellarmine answereth that hee which beleeveth is inclined to love him in whom hee beleeveth but is not forced thereunto which no man averreth


ix
a third similitude he would seeme to produce out of calvins institutions

christ and his spirit cannot be separated so faith

and charitie cannot be severed but though both the parts of this comparison are true yet there is no such similitude propounded by calvin
but in that place he proveth that true faith cannot bee severed from a

godly affection because true faith embraceth christ as he is offered unto us of his father now of his father hee is made unto us not onely righteousnesse to bee received by faith unto justification

but holinesse also to bee applied by his spirit unto sanctification
and therefore those that receive christ receive also his spirit
bellarmine answereth that it is true indeed that he which receiveth christ receiveth him with his spirit sed credendo recipit credit illum habere spiritum sanctificationis but he receiveth by beleeving that is he beleeveth that christ hath aspirit of sanctification but from hence it doth not follow that the spirit of sanctification is alwaies with faith in a man unlesse it be objectively even as health is in a sicke man that hath it not when he thinketh of it and desireth it
thus in popish divinitie to receive the spirit of christ is to beleeve that christ hath a spirit of sanctification but not to be partaker thereof or to have the communion of the holy ghost which notwithstanding all those have who truely beleeve in christ
for all that truely beleeve are the sonnes

of god as have shewed and to so many as be his sonnes god doth send the

spirit of his sonne into their hearts his spirit dwelleth in them and he by his spirit
and if any man have not the spirit of christ

hee is none of his
if therefore all that receive christ receive also his spirit then all that truely beleeve are also endued with charitie as have proved before





his sixth argument is taken from an absurditie which he saith followeth upon our doctrine
for saith he they doe therefore contend that a man is justified by faith onely because if justification depended upon the condition of works or our obedience of the law no man could be certaine of his justification to which effect the apostle argueth rom

and because they beleeve that justification consisteth in this certaintie therefore it wold follow that justification is impossible
but if faith necessarily must bee joyned with charitie and good workes so that otherwise it is not faith but a shadow or counterfeit of it then it followeth that justification in that it dependeth upon a true faith doth also depend upon works and upon love which is the fulfilling of the lawe and consequently that no man can be certaine of his justification but that justification is a thing altogether impossible
and in this argument he doth so please himselfe that he concludeth with this epiphonema forsooth so stable is the dogmaticall building of heretikes that on each side it threatneth ruine

answere briefly by distinction that justification is either before god in foro coelesti or in the court of our owne conscience
before god when the lord imputing the perfect righteousnesse of christ to a beleeving sinner absolveth him from the guilt of his finne and from damnation and accepteth of him as righteous in christ and as an heire of eternall life and this properly is the justification of a sinner
that justification which is in the court of conscience is not justification it selfe but the assurance of it
howbeit commonly men are then said to bee justified and to have pardon of sinne when the pardon is sealed to their owne conscience
deny therefore that our justification before god consisteth in the assurance thereof in our owne

conscience for those which truely beleeve are justified and blessed whether they be assured thereof or not or that it dependeth upon our charitie or our owne good works but that without respect of our charitie or any worthinesse in us the lord doth freely

and of his meere grace even when wee deserve the contrary justifie us so soone as wee truely beleeve in christ that and no other being the condition of the covenant
and howsoever the assurance of our justification before god if we were to be justified by our owne obedience were impossible because to our justification before god perfect and complete obedience is required which to us by reason of the flesh is impossible yet the assurance of our justification in our owne conscience is not impossible but is ordinarily obtained by the children of god by some more by some lesse because it doth not depend upon the perfection but upon the uprightnesse of our obedience
if wee have a true desire an unfained purpose a sincere endevour to walke before god in the obedience of his commandements though wee faile contrary to our desire and purpose in many particulars wee may thereby make our election our calling our justification sure unto us
for by our works our faith is demonstrated and our justification knowne to our selves and others in which sence saint iames saith we are justified by works


xi
in the seventh place bellarmine addeth the consent of the fathers into whose minde hee saith

this absurditie never entred that faith cannot be where charitie is not
and yet for all this bragge he is not able to produce any one pregnant testimony plainely affirming that true faith or justifying faith may bee without charitie wee doe not deny but that the faith of hypocrites and of all other wicked and impenitent sinners which is not a true and a lively but a counterfeit and dead faith which not properly but catachrestically or rather equivocally is called faith is severed from charitie and from all other graces of sanctification
and such is the faith which the fathers say may bee severed from charitie
but though hee hath not cited any one pregnant testimony against us yet one hee hath cited for us in plaine

termes avouching that they doe not truely beleeve nor have true faith who doe not live well and to the same purpose cited augustine and divers others of the fathers

cap iv
whether justifying faith may be without speciall apprehension of christ




the third error of the papists concerning the nature of justifying faith is that they hold it may be as without knowledge and without charity so also without any speciall apprehension or application of christ to the beleever
but the scriptures unto justification require that wee should beleeve in christ
for howsoever by that faith which justifieth wee doe beleeve whatsoever

god hath revealed in his word neither hath any man a justifying faith who denyeth credit to any thing which hee findeth to bee revealed by god notwithstanding as it justifyeth it onely respecteth christ either directly and expressely or indirectly and by consequence christ himselfe being as shall hereafter shew the proper object of justifying faith
for the promise of justification and salvation in the gospell is not made to the beliefe of other things but onely to true faith in christ

for god so loved the world that hee gave his onely begotten son that whosoever beleeveth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
and as moses lifted up the serpent

in the wildernesse that they who were bitten of the fiery serpents by looking on the brasen serpent which was a figure of christ should bee healed even so the sonne of man was to be lifted up upon the crosse that whosoever being stung by the old serpent the devill looketh

upon him with the ei of a true faith that is beleeueth in him should not perish but have eternall life which truth is acknowledged by the

master of the sentences quem deus proposuit propitiatorem per fidem in sanguine ipsius per fidem passionis ut lim aspicientes in serpentem aneum in lign erectu morsibus serpentum sanabantur
si ergo recto fidei intuitu in illum respicimus qui pro nobis pependit in ligo vinculis dlaboli solvimur peccatis
as therefore they who were bitten by the same eyes wherewith they looked upon the brasen serpent beheld all other things which were subject to their view but were cured by looking upon the serpent and not by beholding any other thing so wee by the same eye of the soule which is faith doe beleeve all other things which god hath propounded to bee beleeved his word being the objectum adquatum of our faith but we are justifyed and saved by beleeving in christ and not by beleeving of

any other thing
in so much that if we should beleeve all other things and did not beleeve in christ our faith would not justifie us
and therefore in the scriptures justifying faith is ordinarily called faith in

christ and sometimes the faith

of christ and sometimes his knowledge

whereby is meant not that christ is the subject but the proper object of justifying faith which is a truth so manifest that no christian ought to doubt of it
for all true christians are so called because they beleeve in christ and by beleeving in him doe hope to bee saved by him


ii
now to beleeve in christ is to receive him ioh

and

not to receive him is not to beleeve in him vers
for to receive christ being so farre removed from us is a spirituall action of the soule that is to say of the mind and of the heart whereby we first apprehend and after apply christ unto our selves
if therefore it bee asked

qumodo tenebo absentem quomodo in coelm manum mittam ut ibi sedentem teneam how should lay hold upon him that is absent how should send up my hand into heaven to lay hold on him sitting there augustine answereth fidem mitte tenuisti
send up thy faith and thou hast laid hold on him
but first wee receive christ in our minde and judgement by assent which if it bee a bare and as it were a literall and uneffectuall assent wee receive him at the most as the saviour of the world but not as our saviour which is the faith of hypocrites yea and of devils and is all that th papists require as necessary to true faith
but if it bee a spirituall lively and effectuall assent it worketh upon the heart that is both the affections and the will so that hee which in his judgement truely and effectually assenteth to the truth of the gospell that iesus the sonne of the blessed virgin is the eternall sonne of god the messias and saviour of all that truely beleeve in him doth also in his heart embrace him heartily desiring to bee made partaker of him and in his will unfainedly purposing and resolving to acknowledge him to bee our lord and saviour and to rest upon him alone for salvation
by the former which is onely a bare assent we doe after a sort credere christum acknowledging him to bee the saviour of those that beleeve in him by the latter which is the lively and effectuall assent working upon the heart we doe credere in christum and receive him to bee our saviour whereupon necessarily followeth affiance in christ and love of him as our saviour
thus then by a true belief we receive and embrace christ in our judgements by a lively assent in our hearts desiring earnestly to be partakers of him which desire wee expresse by hearty prayer and in our will resolving to acknowledge and professe him to be our only saviour and to rest upon him alone for salvation
so that a true lively and effectull faith is the worke of the whole soule that is to say as well of the heart as of the minde for which cause the apostle saith corde creditur adjustitiam with the heart man beleeveth to righteousnesse rom

and saint luke that the lord opened the heart of lydia to assent to the gospell act


and philip requireth the eunuch to beleeve with his whole heart
act



the former is common to the wicked yea to the devils the later is proper to the children of god
for those who so beleeve are born of god ioh

ioh

the former is a literall a dead a counterfeit a not justifying faith the latter is a lively true and justifying faith
this distinction augustine

maketh betweene saint peters faith and that of the devils though their confessions were alike
thou art the sonne of the living god
hoc dicebat petrus ut christum amplecteretur hoc dicebant
daemones ut christus ab eis recederet
this said peter that hee might embrace christ this spake the devils that christ might depart from them
oecumenius

endeavouring to reconcile the seeming differences betweene the two apostles paul and iames saith there are two significations of the word faith the one as it signifieth undefined span alphabet a simple and bare assent in which sence the devils are said to beleeve that there is one god the other as it importeth undefined span alphabet the accompanying of the disposition or affection with the firme assent
of the former saint iames speaketh and saith that the simple and bare assent is a dead faith but paul of the latter which is not destitute of good workes which after hee calleth undefined span alphabet that which is faith indeed


iii
of this faith whereby wee receive christ to bee our saviour

there are two degrees the former of speciall apprehension whereby wee receive and embrace christ consisting in a lively and effectuall beleefe whereby we truly receive christ in our judgement by a willing assent in our affections by an earnest desire to bee made partakers of him and of his merits which is the desire of application in our will by a setled resolution to acknowledge him to bee our saviour and to rest upon him for salvation which is the unfained purpose and endeavour of application
so that in this first degree though we are not able actually to apply the promise of the gospell unto our selves yet that application is both desired and intended
the other is of actuall and speciall application of the promise to our selves as having the condition of the promise
the former is fides principiorum being grounded on the expresse word of god whosoever beleeveth in christ shall bee saved
the other is fides conclusionum necessarily deduced from the word by application in a practicall syllogisme after this manner whosoever beleeveth in christ shall be saved which generall is true in every particular as the apostle teacheth rom

therefore thou doest beleeve in christ thou shalt bee saved but saith the faithfull man doe beleeve in christ therefore shall be saved which conclusion cannot be false the premisses being true
to the former all men are necessarily tied under paine of damnation iohn

to the latter none are tied but they onely who have the former
for the former is the condition of the promise which whosoever hath not he ought not to apply the promise to himselfe unlesse hee will perniciously deceive himselfe
by the former wee are justified before god in the court of heaven which is properly called justification by the latter we are justified in the court of our conscience which is not properly justification

but the assurance of it
the former goeth before remission of sinne the latter followes after
the former is the worke of gods spirit as he doth

regenerate us in our first effectuall calling the latter as hee is the spirit of adoption sealing us after wee

have beleeved
the former is ordinarily wrought by the hearing of the word the holy ghost opening the

heart of the hearer to assent thereto and not by the ministry of the sacraments which being the seales

of that righteousnesse which is by faith were ordained to this purpose to confirme our faith in the application of the promise in particularunto our selves and in the particular assurance of our justification and salvation by christ that those who have the first degree offaith may proceed to the second
for if thou doest truely beleeve that christ is the saviour thou art bound to beleeve that hee is thy saviour otherwise thou

makest god a lyar
that therefore thou mayest learne to apply christ unto thy selfe god by his minister delivereth to thee in particular the sacrament as it were a pledge to assure thee in particular that as the minister doth deliver unto thee the outward signe so the lord doth communicate unto thee that beleevest according to the first degree of faith the thing signified that is to say
christ with all his merits to thy justification sanctification and salvation


iv
this distinction of the degrees of faith as it is most comfortable

for hereby we are taught how to attaine to assurance of salvation as elsewhere

have shewed for having the first degree which is the condition of the promise thou maiest apply the promise to thy selfe and by application attaine to assurance so it is most true and most necessary to bee held
and first as touching the former degree

which is the speciall apprehension and embracing of christ by a lively assent accompanyed with the desire of the heart and resolution of the will as have said that it is that faith which is the condition of the promise and by which wee are justified before god have proved by plaine testimonies of scriptures and other pregnant proofes
the places of scripture which alleaged were these mat


ioh

act



rom


ioh


whereunto may bee added
ioh

among the manifold proofes which produced this is one that if there bee no other justifying faith but the speciall faith whereby wee are assured of the remission of our sinnes then two absurdities will follow
the one that wee must apply the promises to our selves before wee have the condition thereof which as wee ought not to doe lest wee play the hypocrites so wee cannot doe unlesse wee will perniciously deceive our selves
the promise is whosoever beleeveth in christ hath remission of sinne whosoever beleeveth in christ shall bee saved
this promise is made to none but to those who truely beleeve and are endued with a justifying faith which is the condition of the promise
it is evident therefore that a man must bee endued with justifying faith before hee can apply the promise and hee must apply the promise before hee can have any assurance by speciall faith
the second absurdity is that a man must bee assured that his

sinnes be forgiven before they be forgiven and so must beleeve a lie yea that a man must bee assured that they are forgiven to the end that they may be forgiven which is a great absurdity
this therefore is an undeniable truth that before we can either apply the promises or attaine to assurance of remission of sinne we must be endued with true justifying faith which is the condition of the promise and the meanes to obtaine remission
must beleeve therefore by a justifying faith before can have remission of sinnes must have remission of sinnes before can have any assurance thereof and must ascend by many degrees of assurance before come to full assurance which yet in this life is never so full but that still more may and ought to be added to it



as touching the second which by some is called speciall faith

not onely in respect of the object which is christ for so the former is also speciall but in respect of the effect which is by actuall application of the promises to a mans selfe to assure him in particular of his justification and salvation it is by some both protestant and popish writers called fiducia that is affiance
howbeit the most of our writers by it meant assurance
but unproperly howsoever for neither is faith affiance nor affiance assurance

this speciall apprehension application of christ though scorn'd by the papists yet is it of all graces the most comfortable most profitable most necessary
most comfortable for the very life of this life is the assurance of a better life
most necessary because without this speciall receiving of christ first by apprehension and then by application we can have no other saving grace
how can we love god or our neighbour for gods sake how can we hope and trust in him how can we rejoyce in him or be thankefull to him if we be not perswaded of his love and bounty towards us and so of the rest
most profitable because from it all other graces proceed and according to the measure of it is the measure of all other graces as have elsewhere shewed
for if the love of god bee shed abroad in thy heart by the holy ghost that is if by faith thou art perswaded of gods love towards thee thou wilt be moved to love the lord and thy neighbour for his sake then wilt thou hope and trust in him then wilt thou rejoyce in him and bee thankefull unto him and so forth
and the greater thy perswasion is of his love and goodnesse towards thee so much the greater will be thy love thy hope thy trust thy thankefulnesse thy rejoycing in him
when as therefore the papists detest and scorne our doctrine concerning speciall faith they doe plainely bewray themselves to have no saving grace nor any truth or power of religion in them


vi
but that this speciall receiving and embracing of christ by

faith is necessary to justification and that faith doth not justifie without it it doth evidently appeare by the third and fourth points before handled in the fourth and fifth bookes
for if we be justified only by the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him then are we not justified by faith as it is an habit or quality inherent in us but as it is the hand and instrument whereby we receive christ his righteousnesse

which as it is imputed to us by god so we apprehend it by faith
and because faith alone doth receive christ and all his merits therefore the same benefits which we receive from christ and are properly to bee ascribed unto him as the authour of them are in the scriptures attributed also to faith because by faith we receive christ

but if we doe not receive and embrace christ by a lively

assent at the least working in our hearts an unfained desire to be made partakers of him and in our wils a settled resolution to acknowledge him to bee our saviour and to rest upon him alone for salvation without this speciall apprehension and application at least in desire and intent christ and his merits doe not availe them that are adulti and come to yeeres of discretion unlesse it be to their greater condemnation who not caring to lay hold upon christ and to apprehend and apply his merits unto them suffer as much as in them lyeth his precious blood to be spilt in vaine as it is in vaine to them who doe not apprehend and seeke to apply it to themselves
for though the obedience of christ both active and passive bee a robe of righteousnesse and

our very wedding garment to cover our nakednesse and our sinnes yet it will not cover us unlesse it bee put on
though his stripes and sufferings be a soveraigne salve to cure our soules yet it will not cure them unlesse it be applyd
though his body be meate indeed and his bloud bee drinke indeed to nourish us unto eternall life yet they will not yeeld nourishment unto us unlesse we eate his body and drinke his bloud all which is done by faith apprehending and applying christ whereby we put on him and his righteousnesse apply the salve of his sufferings eate his body and drinke his bloud
the which because the papists want and wanting reject they are faine to flee to their outward formalities wherein their religion consisteth and to their opus operatum in the sacraments as if they without a true and lively faith were able to justifie and to save them without which notwithstanding our blessed saviour himselfe doth not availe men to salvation
he that beleeveth and is baptized shall be saved but he that beleeveth not being adultus though hee bee baptized and receive all the sacraments of the romance church hee shall notwithstanding be condemned
mar

ioh

it is therefore plaine and evident that the faith which doth justifie must not bee a bare assent but a lively beleefe or assent specially apprehending and embracing and in desire at the least and purpose applying christ unto us
for actuall application cannot bee made untill wee finde our selves to have the condition of the promise which is that former degree of faith which being had and finding our selves to have it wee are actually to apply the promise and by application to gather assurance which some call speciall faith


viii
now let us see what the papists can object against this

cleare truth
there are two things or rather names which they dispute against viz fides specialis and fiducia speciall faith and affiance which dispute notwithstanding hindreth not anything which have spoken of the nature of justifying faith as it justifieth us before god
for of justification taken in a large sence there are two degrees though of that which properly is called justification before god there neither are nor can bee any degrees as have shewed
the former is the justification of a sinner before god in the court of heaven by imputation of christs righteousnesse apprehended by a lively assent or beleefe
the second is our justification in the court of our owne conscience when wee are perswaded and in some measure assured of our justification which assurance of some is called fides specialis by which wee are not first justified before god but is then wrought in us when being already justified by faith the holy ghost the spirit of promise shedding abroad

the love of god in our hearts sealeth us after wee have beleeved eph

how beit the former degree of faith is also truely called speciall both in respect of the speciall object which is christ and in regard of the speciall effect which is the speciall apprehension or embracing of christ not onely in the judgement by a lively assent but also in the heart that is the will and affections by a desire to bee made

partaker of him and his merits and by a setled will and resolution to acknowledge him to bee our saviour and to rely upon him alone for salvation
and in this sence that faith by which we are justified before god is a speciall faith
but if that onely be called speciall faith by which we are justified in our owne consciences that is assured of our justification that assurance arising from the actuall application of the promise to our selves then say and avouch that this speciall faith is not that by which we are justified before god
for we must have a justifying faith being the condition of the promise before we can proceed to application and first wee must bee justified before god before wee can have any assurance thereof in our owne consciences when as therefore the papists dispute against tis speciall faith proving that by it we are not ustified before god they plead besides the purpose
and yet for all their proofes it is truely called a justifying faith because by it we are justified in the court of our owne conscience


ix
the like is to be said of fiducia or affiance which is called undefined span alphabet against which the papists hotly dispute proving that it is not of the essence of justifying faith when notwithstanding divers of their owne writers as well as of ours have expounded credere by fidere and fides by fiducia
but they should understand that many of our writers by affiance meane assurance which is the plerophorie of faith unproperly confesse but that was their meaning· as for affiance though it be not of the proper nature and essence of faith yet it is an unseparable fruit of speciall faith in so much that sometimes it seemeth to be implyed in the signification of beleeving in christ for hee that doth beleeve in christ doth first by a lively assent acknowledge him to bee the saviour of all that truely beleeve in him and secondly so beleeving hee is perswaded that he is a saviour to him and thirdly beleeving christ to be his saviour doth therefore repose his affiance and trust in him for salvation
but howsoever so much sometimes is implyed in the phrase of beleeving in christ yet in the most ordinary and usuall acception of the word in the scriptures of the new testament no more is signified than the lively assent and acknowledging of christ yea sometimes the phrase is used of those who did not so much as give a lively assent or beleeved with their heart
howsoever being convicted by the evidence of truth sealed by miracles they assented to the truth and acknowledged christ to be the messias
such were those ioh

who are said to have beleeved on his name when they saw the miracles which hee did to whom notwithstanding our saviour would give no credit because hee knew what was in them
such a beleever was sim magus who being convinced by the evidence of truth confirmed by miracles assented in his judgement but beleeved not with his heart for his heart was not right within him act



and such a one was iudas ioh

who though he beleeved as being a disciple yea an apostle of christ yet beleeved not in deed and in truth



but that the phrase is used ordinarily of those which received

christ by a true and lively assent could prove by multitude of testimonies

divers whereof have elsewhere mentioned
but will content my selfe with two instances of the samaritanes and of the eunuch
of the samaritanes it is said iohn

that many of them beleeved in christ for the saying of the woman who could beleeve no more than she had told them which at the most was that hee was christ
and after when they professed that they beleeved because of his owne word all that they beleeved was this that he was indeed the chist the saviour of the world verse

the eunuch

when philip told him that hee might bee baptized if hee beleeved with his whole heart maketh this profession of his faith beleeve that iesus christ is the sonne of god


xi
now that affiance is not faith briefely shew thus
first

because it is a fruit and effect of faith
for by faith wee have affiance ephes


faith therefore is the cause affiance the effect· and the same thing cannot be both the cause and the effect
for whereas some deny this consequence trusting to an unlike example for say they as naturall philosophy is the science of naturall things and yet by it wee attaine to the science of naturall things so though affiance be faith and faith affiance yet by faith wee attaine to affiance answere that there is an homonymie in the word science which in the former part of the example signifieth the art or doctrine which is a comprehension of precepts in the latter the habit of the knowledge of naturall things which by the doctrine holpen with the gifts of nature and confirmed by exercise we attaine unto
secondly because faith is an habit of the minde affiance an affection of the heart and so also differ in the subject
for faith being a perswasion is seated in the minde though working upon the heart affiance or trust being an affection is seated in the heart though proceeding from the perswasion of the minde
thirdly because they differ not onely in the subject but also in the object
the object of faith is verum that which is true the object of affiance is bonum that which is good
yea but say some the promise is good and therefore the object of aith is good
answer the thng promised is good and therefore conceive affiance or hope which two in respect of the time to come differ not
but be the thing promised never so good yet beleeve not the promise unlesse bee perswaded that it is true
faith therefore layeth hold on the promise as being true affiance or hope expect the thing promised as being good
those therefore who hold that affiance properly so called is faith or faith affiance are not to bee defended
those which by affiance understand assurance and say that justifying faith is affiance doe speake the truth if they understand by faith not that by which we are justified before god but that by which we are justified that is assured of our justification in our own conscience
concerning which there needs not to be any other controversie betweene us and the papists than this whether there bee any such certaintie or assurance to be had
but that is a different question not pertinent to the poynt in hand which have elsewhere

cleared
and so much of the nature of justifying faith

chap
of the subject of justifying faith



now come to the subject that is both the parties

to whom it belongeth and the part of the soule wherein it is
as touching the parties in

whom it is the papists hold
first that it is common to the godly with the wicked
secondly that it is common to the elect with the reprobate
the former is the same in substance with that which have already handled whether true faith may be severed from charity and other graces the negative part of which question have proved and consequently of this that justifying faith is not common to the godly with the wicked
as touching the second whether it bee common to the elect with the reprobate bellarmine

propoundeth the romish tenet to be this fidem justitiam non esse propriam electorm semel habitam amitti posse that faith and justice is not proper to the elect and that it being once had it may be lost which is the very question of perseverance whereof have written a full treatise against bellarmine proving that true justifying faith is proper to the elect and that being once had it is never lost either totally or finally


ii
now as touching the part of the soule wherein justifying

faith is seated bellarmine and many other papist hold that it is seated in the understanding onely and of us they report that we hold it to be seated in the will onely which they doe report against their owne knowledge knowing that wee hold faith to bee a perswasion of the minde and an assent and finding fault with calvin for defining faith to be a kinde of knowledge as it is indeed that kind of knowledge which we have by report or relation from god grounded upon the infallible authoritie of god the relator and finally not being ignorant that we hold the proper object of faith to be the truth
but we hold that it is seated both in the understanding and in the will and my reason brieely is this because it is a voluntary assent and is so defined not onely by some of the ancient fathers but also by the ancient philosophers who as thcodore

reporteth doe define it to bee undefined span alphabet a willing assent of the soule
threfore to beleeve is an act both of the understanding and of the will
of the understanding as it is an assent of the will as it is voluntary
even as liberum rbitrium as it is arbitrium belongeth to the understanding and as it is liberum to the will not that we seate it in two divers parts of the soule but onely in the

mind that is the reasonable or intellectuall part though it worketh upon the affections also
for the better understanding whereof wee are to know that when the holy ghost is pleased to worke the grace of faith in the soules of any of the elect which ordinarily he doth

by the ministery of the gospell he openeth their hearts as he did the heart of lydia

to assent to the gospell which he doth first by illuminating their understanding and opening the eyes of their minde that they may rightly conceive and judge of the doctrine of salvation and secondly by opening as it were the eares of the mind and enclining the will to affect and embrace what the understanding hath judged and approved to be true and good
the understanding therefore approving and the will which is intellectus extensus and ordinarily followeth the judgement of the practick understanding embracing the doctrine of the gospell which promiseth salvation by christ to all that beleeve the mind which containeth both these faculties being thus opened by the holy ghost doth williugly assent to the doctrin of the gospell concerning salvation by christ
faith therefore is a voluntary assent of the mind to the promise of the gospell unto which the acts of both the faculties of the mind concurre of the understanding to judge that the thing propounded to be beleeved is true and good
meane that the promise is true and the thing promised good of the will to accept and to embrace that for true and good which the understanding hath judged to be such
out of both which ariseth the voluntary assent of the minde which wee call faith
this faith thus wrought by the holy ghost the spirit of regeneration being lively and effectuall worketh upon the heart and affections which also being renewed by the holy ghost readily follow the willing assent of the minde both to affect christ to desire to bee made partakers of him to love him and torest upon him for salvation and also to and to detest those things which are repugnant to the doctrine of the gospel the chiefe whereof is sinne


iii
now that the act of the will doth concurre to faith and

that faith which is an habit of the minde is seated as well in the will as in the understanding is a thing testified by the fathers and confessed by the and by the moderne doctors of the romane church
and first for the fathers

clemens alexandrinus saith that faith it the willing assent of the soule and so theodoret doth define it

undefined span alphabet

ambrose

fides non necessitatis sed voluntatis res est
faith is a matter of will and not of necessity therefore the apostle saith not that wee domineere over your faith for dominion is cause of necessity and againe to beleeve or not to beleeve it is an act of the will

augustine

grace therfore preventeth or goeth before faith otherwise if faith prevent it then also the will preveneth it quia fides sine volulate on potest esse because faith cannot be without will

againe

what is it to beleeve but to consent that the thing is true which is said consensio autemutique volentis est and consenting undoubtedly

is of him that is willing
every

man when he willeth beleeveth cum credit volens credit and when he doth beleeve hee doth willingly beleeve

voluntate

utique credimus verily we beleeve with our will

fides in credentium voluntate consistit faith standeth in the will of the beleevers

and writing upon ioh


what say we here brethren if we be drawne unto christ then wee beleeve against our wills
no saith hee· a man may enter into the church nolens against his will hee may come to the altar nilling hee may receive the sacrament nilling credere non potest nisi volens hee cannot beleeve unlesse hee bee willing

and lastly

in the elect the will is prepared of the lord that therefore belongeth to faith qu in voluntate est which is in the will


iv
bonaventure

it were not virtuovs to beleeve if it were not voluntary ipsum velle credere est essentiale ipsi fidei to beleeve willingly is essentiall to faith it selfe
vnto the being of the vertue of faith with the act of reason or understanding concurreth the act of the will

faith

never should be a vertue though it did enlighten the understanding never so much if it did not also rectifie the will

thomas aquinas

writing on rom

signanter autem dicit corde creditur id est voluntate he peaketh remarkeably men beleeve with the hearr that is with the will
for all other things which appertaine to the outward worship of god potest a man may doe them nilling sed credere non potest nisi volens but none can beleeve that is not willing for the understanding of him that beleeveth is not determined to assent unto the truth by necessity of reason as of him that hath science but by the will

againe

intellectus credntis determinatur ad unum non per ratione sed per voluntatem

credere

gabriel biel

the act of faith is to beleeve which is an act of the understanding assenting to the truth proceeding from the command of the will qui nullus credit nisi volens because no man beleeveth that is not willing· as saint auguste

teacheth


cardin all contarenus

actus fidei quam vis sit elicitus ab intellectu est tamen imperatus

salmeron

paul saith men beleeve with the heart to exclude fayning with which many come to baptisme and to shew that faith which justifieth is commanded by the will to note the difference of forced faith such as is in devils and was in those men who beleeved in christ compelled

by the miracles but christ

did not concredit himselfe to them for such a faith doth not justifie
for as science is begotten by virtue of demonstrative reason so faith is not demonstrated but is undertaken by the virtue or power of the will captivating the understanding unto the obedience of christ who doth infuse it wherefore augustine tract

in ioan other things saith hee a man may doe against his will but none can beleeve but he that is willing


vi
thus have proved against bellarmine that to beleeve is an

act of the will as well as of the understanding and that the seat of faith is neither the understanding alone nor the will alone but the mind which comprehendeth both
howbeit cannot altogether subscribe to the judgement of the and other learned men whether protestants or papists who teach that the understanding is commanded by the will to assent unto divine truthes and that it doth credere ex imperio voluntatis
for doe not conceive how the will which is intellectus extensus and followeth the judgement of the practike understanding in so much that it willeth nothing but what the understanding approveth and judgeth to be willed how it say should command the understanding
neither doth their reason satisfie which is this that the understanding of man in matters pertaining to science is determined to one thing by the evidence of the thing or necessity of reason not by the will but the understanding of man in matters belonging to faith which sometimes surpasse the capacity of humane reason cannot be determined to any particular either by the evidence of the thing or by necessity of reason both which are wanting in the objects of faith which are things hoped for and things not seene
and therefore say they there can no assent bee given unlesse the understanding be commanded by the will to assent
but answere as the ground of knowing things by science is the evidence of the thing or necessity of reason so the ground of beleeving things is the authority of god speaking in his word which is infallible and in certainty surpasseth the grounds of science and by it the understanding is determined to such particulars as it conceiveth to be revealed of god
as therefore in things of science which the understanding doth judge to bee evident and of necessary truth the will doth readily embrace them following therin the judgment of the understanding and so the mind which containeth both faculties doth willingly and yet necessarily assent therto moved therunto by the evidence of necessary truth so in matters of faith which the understanding though it comprehends them not yet doth judge infallibly true moved thereto by the authority of god revealing those truthes the will as conceive being captivated by the understanding and submitting it selfe to the judgement thereof the mind doth willingly and yet necessarily assent to such truthes revealed by god moved thereunto by the infallible authority of god speaking in his word
which in certainty of truth doth farre surmount all grounds of science and doth captivate the understanding and it the will
why therefore the assent to divine truthes which are grounded

upon a most certaine and inallible soundation which perswadeth the understanding should more proceed from the will than the assent to humane sciences cannot conceive or why the will should command the understanding in them more than in matters of science

cap vi
of the object of justifying faith



so much of the subject now wee come to the object of justifying aith where the question ought not to be made coneeming the object of faith at large but of that object which is proper to faith as it justifieth
for we doe freely confese that the object of faith is all and every truth revealed unto us by god and that the word of god is objectum fidei adaquatum the even object of aith that is we are bound to beleeve whatsoever is contained in the word but what is not contained in the word of god we are not to beleeve it as a matter of aith
and that therefore by the ame faith by which we are justified we beleeve whatsoever is contained in the written word of god whether expressely or by necessary consequence
so that bellarmine

might have saved a great deale of labour idlely spent in proving that which we confesse that by faith we beleeve the creation

and all other truths revealed in the word yea we professe him to have no true justifying faith who denieth credit to any thing which hee findeth revealed by god
howbeit the papi extend this object not onely to the canoicall scriptures but also to those which we according to all almost antiquitie call apocryphall and not onely to the written word but also to their unwritten verities as they call the traditions of the church of rome that is such doctrines and ordinances as that church doth teach and observe having no ground nor warrant in the scriptures
the which notwithstanding whiles they doe not onely match but also preferre them before the written word doe evidently prove the pope who by their doctrine is above the church and the church above the scriptures to bee antichrist
but this is another controversie whereinto may not now make an excusion
onely desire the reader to take notice of this marke among others of the catholike apostaie of the romane church which hath not onely departed from the ancient doctrine and rule of faith which is the scriptures but also have set up a new rule the last resolution of their faith being into the infallible judgement and irrefragable

authority of the bishop of rome and to this purpose let him consider these two testimonies of saint bsil

it is a manifest falling away from the faith and conviction of pride either to reject any of those things that are written or to bring in any of those things that are not written

the other

undefined span alphabet
all that is without the scripture inspired of god being not of faith is sinne


ii
but howsoever by that faith which justifieth wee beleeve all and every truth revealed by god yet the proper and formall object of justifying faith quatnus justificat and by beleeving whereof it doth justifie is not every truth but that onely which undefined span alphabet is called the truth that is christ with all his merits ioh

but not to the beliefe of other things is the promise made as of the law or of the story of the bible or of predictions excepting those stories and propheies which concerne christ
for howsoever a man cannot have a justifying faith who denieth credit to any of those other things which he findeth to be revealed by god yet not by beleeving of them but by beleeving in christ hee is justified


iii
but here it may be objected that the faith whereby abraham was justified had no relation to the promise of salvation by christ

but to the promises of god concerning his seed
whereunto answere first that abraham and all the rest of the faithfull before christ beleeved in the promised seed which was the messias to come and by that faith as the papists themselves confesse were justifyed
secondly the promises which concerned his seed were either the same with the promise of the gospell or it was implyed in them
the maine promise was that in abraham that is in his seed all nations that is the faithfull in all nations should be blessed
for abraham did not conceive that in himselfe all nations should be blessed as if himselfe should be the foundation of happinesse unto all but in his seed
and so the lord himselfe explaneth in gen

and in thy seed that is in christ all the nations of the earth shall be blessed
and so zacharie luk


and peter act


this promise made to abraham is the very same with the promise of the gospell
for as the apostle saith the scripture foreseeing that god would justifie the heathen through faith undefined span alphabet preached before the gospell to abraham saying in thee that is in thy seed shall all nations be blessed
which promise as it had beene formerly made to our first parents

concerning the promised seed so was it after renewed to isaac gen

and to iacob gen

and in effect to david

whose sonne according to the flesh messias was to be who is therefore called the sonne of david and the branch of david
in this promised seed abraham and all other the faithfull beleeved and by beleeving in him were justified


iv
the other promises concerning his seed are two
the former

concerning the multiplication of his seed that hee should bee father of a multitude of nations namely in christ and that hee would be a god to him and his seed hee doth not say to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ gal


that is christ mysticall cor

containing the multitude of the faithfull in all nations both iewes and gentiles
this promise therefore implyeth the former that in christ the promised seed abraham himselfe and his seed that is the faithfull of all nations should be blessed and in confirmation of this promise he was called abraham because he was to be a father of many nations that is of the faithfull of all nations for none but they are accounted abrahams seed rom

gal



and for the same cause hee received the sacrament of circumcision

as a seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith rom

and that in this promise of the multiplication of his seed the promise of the gospell was included appeareth because his faith in this promise was imputed to him for righteousnesse not for the the approbation or justifying of that act as it happened in the zealous act of phineas psal

but for the justification of his person which could not be justified but by faith in christ
which the papists themselves cannot denie
the chiefe thing which abraham apprehended in the promise concerning

his seed was that although he were an hundred yeere old and sarah past yet he should have seed by her and in that seed himselfe and all the faithfull of all nations should be blessed



the latter is that they should possesse the land of promise by

which as by a type was signified the heavenly canaan under which to all the faithfull was promised the kingdome of heaven which was the countrey which they professing themselves pilgrimes did seeke heb

and into which eternall rest iesus was to bring them who beleve even as ioshua the type of christ who also is called

iesus brought the israelites after their peregrinations into that land of rest
so that in the latter promises concerning his seed and the land of promise the former was implyed concerning the promised seed and blessednesse by him as the principall object of abrahams faith for which chiefly hee did so much affect and desire seed
insomuch that when the lord had promised him to bee his buckler and his exceeding great reward abraham replied lord god what wilt thou give mee seeing goe childlesse
as abraham therefore who rejoyced

to see our saviour christs day and as he and the rest of the faithfull having not received the promises concerning the promised seed but having seene them a farre off were perswaded of them that is beleeved them and

embraced them were justified by faith in christ the promised seed so are we and by nothing else

and further we are to note that before those words recorded gen

abraham had by faith embraced the maine promise of the gospell gen

in thee that is in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and by that faith was justified by which also he obeyed god

leaving his owne countrey and by the same faith sojourning in the land of promise as a pilgrime sought a better countrey that is an heavenly
therefore as iames saith when abraham in his great triall

had approved himselfe to be a faithfull man that then the scripture was fulfilled which saith· abraham beleeved god and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse not that then abraham first beleeved but that then by that notable fruit of faith hee approved the truth of his faith and manifested the truth of that oracle which then by good proofe was verified of him so by the like reason may that place gen

be understood that abraham beleeved in the lord and it was counted to him for righteousnesse
not that then abraham either first beleeved or was then first justified for hee had beleeved the grand promise of the gospell before and by it was justified and before this time had brought forth excellent fruits of faith gen chap
but that by this new act of beleeving the promises renewed which the apostle amplifieth rom

the truth of his faith was manifested
and thus bellarmine

himselfe expoundeth those words gen

affirming that as iames applieth them to that act en
so they may be applied to all notable acts of the faith of abraham

againe justification or imputation of righteousnesse is actus continus which is not to be restrained to the instant of our first conversion

and justification but continued to them that beleeve
and therefore so long as they have faith god imputeth righteousnesse unto them


vi
but for the better clearing of this point we are to take notice

that christ and his benefits or the doctrine of salvation by christ are the proper object of justifying faith in two respects both as it justifith befoe god and as in the court of our owne conscience
before god when by a lively and effectuall assent or beleefe as hath beene said wee receive and embrace christ our saviour with all his merits or which is all one the promises of the gospell concerning justification and salvation by him
such was the faith of saint peter math


and of the rest of the apostles ioh

of nathaniel ioh

of martha ioh

of the samaritanes ioh

of the eunuch act


with which whosoever are endued are borne of god ioh

they dwell in god and god in them
ioh


they overcome the world ioh

and unto them blessednesse mat

ioh

justification rom


and salvation is promised ioh

act


in the court of our owne conscience it doth justifie when wee finding that wee have the former degree which is the condition of the promise doe soundly apply the promise to our selves
for hee who knoweth that hee hath the condition not onely may but must apply the promise of the gospell to himselfe otherwise he maketh god a lyar ioh

this application as hath been aid is made by a practicall syllogisme the proposition whereof or undefined span alphabet is this whosoever doth truely beleeve in christ hee shall be saved the assumption or undefined span alphabet but saith the faithfull man do beleeve in christ the conclusion or undefined span alphabet therefore shall be saved
this conclusion is the voice of speciall faith
such was the fath of iob chap

of david psal
of thomas ioh

of saint paul gal


and of all the faithfull in the scriptures who in many places have applyed and as it were appropriated to themselves the mercies of god in christ
and such is and ought to be the faith of all that truely beleeve
for the generall alwaies includeth the particular
if therefore thou doest truely beleeve that iesus is the saviour of all that truely beleeve in him thou art then bound to beleeve that he is thy saviour
of this point have treated elsewhere

and have answered the objections so many as thought worth the answearing


vii
now come to bellarmines dispute concerning the object of faith wherein hee endevoureth to prove and to maintaine three things first that the object of faith is not gods speciall favour in christ but whatsoever god hath reveled
secondly that men may be justified without speciall faith
thirdly that men are not justified by speciall faith
as touching the first wee doe freely confesse that by the justifying faith we doe beleeve whatsoever wee understand to bee revealed by god
and further we professe that by the virtue of justifying faith all articles of christian religion become after a sort the objects of speciall faith
for as he who hath the philosophers stone is said by virtue thereof to turne other metals into gold so it may more truely

be said of him who is indued with that faith whereby we are justified before god that he may and ought to make all the articles of the catholike or dogmaticall faith the precious objects of speciall faith by applying them to his owne good and comfort which being a matter of singular use and comfort will a little insist upon it
doest thou then beleeve by a true and a lively assent as hath been said that iesus the sonne of the blessed virgin is the erernall sonne of god and the saviour of all those that truely beleeve in him thou art then bound to beleeve that hee is thy saviour
doest thou beleeve that christ is thy saviour then must thou beleeve that god the father is thy gracious

and mercifull father in christ that he is all sufficient to bestow upon thee all good things that hee is omnipotent to protect and defend thee from all evill riding upon the heavens

for thy helpe and so of the other attributes that hee is eternall to crowne thee with everlasting happinesse that he is immutable in his love towards thee that

hee is omniscient and therefore knoweth thy wants omnipresent that thou maist powre thy requests into his bosome true and faithfull to performe all his promises to thee just to forgive thee thy sinnes when thou doest confesse them and to justifie thee seeing christ hath satisfied his justice for thee good gracious and mercifull unto thee that

hee hath loved thee in christ with an everlasting love and in him hath adopted thee to bee his sonne and if a sonne then also an heire of god and coheire with christ that hee hath created thee for his owne

glory whereunto he hath subordinated thy salvation that he watcheth over thee by his fatherly providence for thy good causing all things whether good or bad to cooperate for thy good that he will bestow upon thee all good things as shall bee expedient for thee that the corrections which befall thee are fatherly chastisements proceeding from his love that out of very

faithfulnesse he hath caused thee to be afflicted that he tryeth and proveth thee to do thee good

in the end that christ our saviour in whom thou doest beleeve is both god and

man man that hee might both obey and suffer for thee god that his obedience and sufferings might bee most perfectly and allsufficiently satisfactory and meritorious for thee that he was conceived and sanctified

by the holy ghost that he might sanctifie thee that he was incarnate redeeme thee that he suffered for thee that thou mightest bee freed from all punishment properly so called that he was crucified for thee that hee might deliver thee from the curse that hee dyed for thy

sinnes and was buried that thy sinnes might be buried in oblivion that he descended into hel to overcome death and the gates of hell for thee that he arose againe for thy justification that he ascended into heaven to prepare an eternall mansion or thee that he sitteth at the right hand of his pather both as a priest to make inercession for thee and as a king to sudue all the enemies of thy salvation and by his power through faith to keepe thee safe unto eternall life that he will come

againe unto judgement for thy full redemption to marry thee unto himselfe and put thee into the possession of that kingdome which hee

hath purchased for thee
thou art also to beleeve in the holy ghost as thy comforter and sanctifier thou art to beleeve that of the vniverfall

church which is the company of all the elect thou art a member elected of god in christ that thou hast a share in the communion of saints that by christ thou hast remission of sinnes that as when thou diest thou diest in the lord so in him thou shalt arise againe to glory and be made partaker of eternall life


viii
whereas therfore this question is usually made whether every man be bound to beleeve that he is elected that he hath remissio of sins and that he shall be saved and so all the particulars before mentioned that god the father is his father
answere that not every man is bound so to beleeve for then the greater part of men should bee bound to beleeve untruthes
but this say that every man is bound upon paine of damnation to beleeve in christ according to the first degree of faith for he that beleeveth not shall be condemned that is

by a true and lively beliefe or assent to beleeve that iesus is the saviour of all that truely beleeve in him and having this faith thou art bound to beleeve that he is thy saviour that hee died for thy sinnes and rose againe for thy justification that in christ thou art elected that by him thou hast remission of sinnes and that through him thou shalt be saved
but untill thou hast that faith which is the condition of the promise thou maiest not apply and by application beleeve any of these things unlesse thou wilt beguile thy selfe
and thus much may suffice for the first point


ix
for the second where bellarmine proveth that a man may

be justified without speciall faith it is true in respect of our justification before god
but they which hold that wee cannot be justified without speciall faith speake of justification in the court of conscience which none can attaine unto unlesse first they apply the promises of the gospell to themselves
which to doe the papists hold to be carnall presumption
thou maist professe thy selfe to beleeve that christ is the saviour of the world but if thou bee a papist thou maist not beleeve that hee is thy saviour that is to say that thou shalt be saved by him
thou maist say he is thy saviour as the papists held him to be saviour of all as well of those that shall perish as of them that shall be saved but if thou shalt not be saved by him then is hee not indeed and in truth thy saviour
thou maist have a kinde of hope that thou shalt be saved but thou mayst not beleeve it
but that hope will prove a slope which is not grounded upon faith
faith being the foundation of hope and the substance of things hoped for
neither canst thou truely hope for the performance of a promise to thee unlesse first by faith thou art perswaded that it doth belong to thee
thou maist nay thou must be perswaded that it belongeth to thee if thou hast the condition of the promise which is to beleeve in christ for in respect of them that have that condition the promises of the gospell are universally to be understood and as excluding none that beleeve
doft thou therefore truely beleeve in christ by a true and a lively assent receiving

and embracing him as the saviour then maist thou apply the promises of the gospell to thy selfe and by application attaine to some assurance of thy justification and salvation
yea but saith the papist a man cannot be assured by the certainety of faith that he shall be saved for many who have thought themselves sure have beene deceived
but fidei falsum subesse non potest
answere that as there is a knowledge of principles in themselves manifest and of conclusions which are made manifest by discourse though not absolutely true as principles but with presupposall of the premisses they are so true that it is impossible the conclusion should bee false where the premisses are true so there is a faith of principles contained in gods word which is the dogmaticall or catholike faith which are absolutely true and there is a faith of conclusions by necessary consequence deducted from those principles by application of the generall to the particular which though they be not absolutely true· yet they are necessarily true neither can they possibly be false the premisses being true and of such conclusions is the speciall faith
and so much of the second



now for the third where bellarmine disputeth that we are not

justified by speciall faith it is true in respect of justification before god but it is false in respect of justification in the court of conscience without which no man can boldly say that he is justified before god
of which justification in the court of onscience they must bee understood to speake who unto justification equire speciall faith· by which they are not properly justified and before god· but assured thereof in their owne conscience
and no doubt but this is a thing most worthy to be urged and beat upon as being that thing which above all other things in this world is to be desired and laboured for according to the xhortation of the apostle peter

give diligence to make your calling and election sure· but this speciall faith the papists above all things derid and detes· thereby discovering themselves to bee· as have elsewhere shewed voide of all truth and power of religion
it being as have said and proved a thing most profitable most comfortable most necessary without which no christian can have any true pce or sound comfor or oug to have contentment in his present estate untill have tained unto it in some measure
and when hee attained to some measure he must endevour more and moe to increase it
but hereof have treated in another place

wherunto referre the christian reader

cap vii
of the acts or effects of faith and first whether faith doth justifie or only dispose to justification
secondly whether it doth justifie formally



the next controversie is concerning that act or effect

of justifying faith in respect whereof it is called justifying faith
of this there are three questions the first whether faith doth indeed justifie or onely dispose a man to justification
secondly whether it justifie formally as part of inherent righteousnesse or instrumentally as the hand to receive christ who is our righteousesse
thirdly whether it justifie alone
the assertions of the papists in the two former questions doe not seeme to ang well together
for if faith goe before justification disposing a man thereto how doth it justifie formally as part of that righteousnesse whereby a man is as they speake formally just
and if no dispositions be required to justification to what purpose doe they tell us that a man must be disposed and prepared by faith and other virtues
for howsoever in their speculations they require preparative dispositions to justification yet in their practise they seeme to require
for their justification which is in fact and in deed is restrained to their sacraments as namely to bap
and their sacraments justifie ex and therefore without necessity of any foregoing dispositions
for if any virtuous or good disposition were required then should their sacraments justifie not ex but ex
onely they require that he who is by the sacrament to be justified doe not lis that is interpose the obstacls of some mortall sinne
and what be these dispositions which must goe before justification


ii
forsooth there are seven which according to the decree

of the councell of trent bellarmine reckoneth de justif lib
ca to prove that faith doth not justifie alone because the other sixe also doe dispose men thereunto
the seven are faith feare hope love penitencie a purpose and desire to receive the sacrament a purpose of amendment of life
all which doe but prepare and dispose a man
but it is the sacrament as namely of baptisme

that doth actually justifie and without which no man is justified
but would gladly know whether these seven preparatives be fruits of grace or works of nature
not of grace for as they teach no man hath grace before iustification what

then they are the fruits of nature holpen wot not by what grace which if it were true would not onely prove the maine assertion of the pelagians gratiam secundùm merita dari or as in other words it is expressed in the councell of

trent secundùm propriam cajusque dispositionem operationem
for though according to their doctrine these preparations are not merits of condignity as they say yet they bee of congruity but also disprove the doctrine of the apostle that we are justified freely by his grace
but this seemeth to me absurd that men should have one justifying faith and so one hope and one love going before justification and another infused in our justification and that by the one justifying faith going before we should be prepared to justification and by the other infused in our justification we should in part be formally justified
but this is certaine that that faith which in order of time goeth before justification is no true justifying faith
for that which goeth before justification goeth also before regeneration and what goeth before regeneration is of nature and not of grace
but faith in order of time goeth not before justification though in order of nature it doth for so soone as a man beleeveth he is justified as hierome saith

talis est ille qui in christum credidit die qua credidit qualis ille qui universam legem implevit
such a one is hee that beleeveth in christ the very day that hee beleeveth as hee that hath fulfilled the whole law nor in order of nature before regeneration for in our regeneration it is wrought
as therefore no man hath faith who is not regenerated so no man hath faith who is not thereby justified
the scripture is plaine that in christ whosoever beleeveth undefined span alphabet is justified act


he that beleeveth in christ is passed from death to life ioh



which passage from death to life is justification whereby as themselves

teach a man is translated from the state of death and damnation into a state of grace and salvation
faith therefore actually justifieth and not disposeth onely to justification


iii
the other question is whether faith doth justifie formally

as they speake as being a part of inherent righteousnesse or instrumentally only as the hand to receive christ who is our righteousnesse
the romane catholikes hold he former the true catholikes the latter
but the former have sufficiently disproved before and proved the latter
for if we be not justified by any grace or righteousnesse inherent in our selves or performed by our selves which have before

by many undeniable arguments demonstrated then it followeth necessarily that we are not justified by faith as it is a gift or grace an act or habit or quality inherent in us or performed by us
and if we be justified by the righteousnesse of christ onely which being out of us in him is imputed to those who receive it by faith which also before

invincibly proved then also it followeth by necessary consequence that wee are justified by faith onely as it is the instrument or hand to apprehend or receive christ who is our righteousnesse
wherefore where faith is said to justifie or to bee imputed to righteousnesse it must of necessity be understood relatively and in respect of the object to which

purpose both justification and all other benefits which we receive by christ are attributed to faith as have shewed

before
not that faith it selfe worketh these things but because by it wee receive christ and with him all his merits and benefits
and for the same cause the faith of all the faithfull though unequall in degrees in some greater in some lesse is undefined span alphabet precious in the righteousnesse of god and our saviour iesus christ pet


which is an evidence that faith doth not justifie in respect of its owne dignity or worthinesse but in respect of the object which it doth receive which being the most perfect righteousnesse of christ unto which nothing can be added is one and the same to all that receive it
of this see more lib
cap





iv
here now the papists because wee deny faith to justifie in

respect of its owne worthinesse and merit take occasion to inveigh

against us as if we made it titulum sine re and as it were a matter of nothing
which is a malicious and yet but a frivolous cavill
for first

in respect of justification we acknowledge it to bee the onely instrument or hand to receive christ to be the condition of the covenant of grace to which the promises of remission of sinnes and of salvation are made without which the promises of the gospell doe not appertaine unto us and without which our blessed saviour doth not save us
secondly in respect of sanctification wee attribute all that and more which the papists ascribe unto it in respect of their imaginary justification
that it is the beginning the foundation and root of all inherent righteousnesse the mother of all other sanctifying graces which purifieth the heart and worketh by love without which it is impossible to please god without which whatsoever is done is sinne



but howsoever here the papists would seeme to plead for faith yet the truth is that as they have abolished the benefit of justification as it is taught in the holy scriptures so with it they have taken away the justifying faith
for though they retaine the name yet in their doctrine there is no such thing
for first to faith they doe not ascribe the power to justifie but only to be a disposition one among seven even such a one as servile feare is of a man unto inherent righteousnesse or to the grace of sanctification it selfe being not as yet a justifying or sanctifying grace
secondly that faith being infused becommeth the beginning and a part of formall inherent righteousnesse
but so small a part they assigne unto it that they say that the habit of formall righteousnesse differeth not from the habit of charity so that in justification it hath no use at all and in sanctification charity is all in all which is a manifest evidence that the church of rome is fallen away from the ancient doctrine of the faith
for both scriptures and fathers every where ascribe justification to faith and not to charitie to faith and not to workes but the papists ascribe the first justification to charitie which they make to be the onely formall cause of justification which as themselves teach is but one and the second justification they assigne to workes

chap
viii
whether we be justified by faith alone the state of the controversie and some reasons on our part



now come to the third question which is the

principall concerning faith whether we be justified by faith alone as wee with all antiquity doe hold or not by faith alone but also by other habits of grace as charitie and the rest and by the workes of grace which the papists hold to concur in us to the act of justification as the causes thereof
where first we are to explaine our assertion and afterwards both to prove and to maintaine it
and great reason there is that wee should explaine it because the papists most wickedly against their owne knowledge calumniate our doctrine in this point
will therefore explaine all the three termes fides justificat sola faith doth justifie alone for by faith wee doe not understand

as have shewed before neither the profession of faith or faith onely professed which iames doth deny to justifie nor that faith which is a bare assent which is the faith of papists and is common to them with the divels and with other hypocrites and wicked men for such a faith we deny to justifie either alone or at all but a true lively and effectuall beleefe in christ being a speciall apprehension or receiving and embracing of christ and of the promises of the gospell joyned with application or at least with a true desire will and endevour thereof
the which faith also wee deny to be true if in some measure it doe not purifie the heart if it doe not worke by love if it cannot be demonstrated by good workes


ii
now for the word justifie shall need to tell you that by

justifying we doe not meane sanctifying and yet such is the blinded malice of the papists as that because they wickedly confound justification and sanctification which we carefully according to the scriptures distinguish they beare the world in hand that our assertion is this in effect that faith alone doth sanctifie and that nothing concurreth to sanctification but faith onely and consequently that wee teach the people so they can perswade themselves that they have faith they need not take care either for other graces or for a godly life
but howsoever we hold that faith doth justifie alone yet wee doe not hold that it doth sanctifie alone but that our sanctification is partly habituall unto which with faith concurre the habits of other sanctifying graces as

hope charity and partly actuall which is our new obedience in the practice of good workes


iii
but the word sela alone doth most displease the papists who

will needs part stakes with christ in their justification
this therefore is to be explaned
and first when we say that faith alone doth justifie we doe not meane fidem solitariam that faith which is alone neither doe we in construction joyne sola with fides the subject but with justificat the predicate meaning that true faith though it bee not alone yet it doth justifie alone
even as the eye though in respect of being it is not alone or if it be it is not a true and a living but a dead eie which seeth neither alone nor at all yet in respect of seeing unto which no other member doth concurre with it it being the onely instrument of that faculty it is truely said to see alone so faith though in respect of the being thereof it is not alone or if it bee it is not a true and lively but a counterfeit and dead faith yet in respect of justifying unto which act no other grace doth concurre with it it being the onely instrument of apprehending and receiving christ it is truely said to justifie alone wherefore as the brazen serpent which was a figure of christ was life up and set on high in the wildernesse that whosoever was bitten by the fiery serpents might by looking onely upon it be cured
and although their eye could not properly bee said to cure them yet because it was the onely instrument to apprehend that object which god had ordained as the onely remedy to salve them it is truely said that by onely looking upon that object they were cured
even so our saviour christ was lifted up upon the crosse it is his owne similitude ioh

that whosoever being stung by the old serpent doth but looke upon him with the eye of faith ioh

may be justified and saved for although this eye of the of the soule which is faith cannot be said properly to justifie them who are sinners yet because it is he onely instrument to apprehend that object which god hath ordained as the onely remedy and propitiation for our sinne it is truely said that by beleeving onely in christ we are iustified


iv secondly whereas faith it selfe doth not justifie properly

but the object which it doth apprehend which is christ and his righteousnesse our meaning therefore when wee say that faith alone doth justifie can be no other but this that the righteousnesse of christ alone which is onely apprehended by faith doth justifie us
and forasmuch as this is a necessary disjunction that wee are justified either by that righteousnesse which is inherent in our selves or by that which is out of us in christ for by some righteousnesse wee are justified and a third cannot be named it followeth therefore necessarily that if we be not justified by inherent righteousnesse then by christs righteousnesse alone because a third righteousnesse by which we should bee justified cannot be named


thirdly where wee say that christs righteousnesse alone

which is apprehended by faith alone doth justifie wee doe not meane absolutely that nothing else doth justifie but nothing in that kind viz

that the righteousnesse of christ is the only matter of our justification and faith the onely instrument on our part by which wee are justified
for otherwise as hath before beene shewed wee confesse that many things else doe justifie viz
god as the author and principall efficient of our justification who imputethunto us the righteousnesse of his son
the holy ghost also doth justifie us by working in us the grace of faith hy which he applyeth christs righteousnesse unto us
the ministers also doe justifie as the instruments of the holy ghost both by the ministry of the gospell by which faith is begotten in us and of the sacraments whereby the promises of the gospell are sealed unto us
and lastly good workes doe justifie as the signes and evidences whereby our faith and justification is manifested
but as the matter nothing doth justifie but christs righteousnesse and as the instrument on our part nothing but faith
and in this sense wee doe constantly affirme that by christs righteousnesse alone apprehended by faith alone wee are justified


vi
for the demonstration of our assertion shall not need to

bring many new proofes seeing that all those arguments which before have produced but especially those which concerne the matter and forme of justification doe invincibly prove that wee are justified by the righteousnes of christ alone being apprehended by faith alone and imputed to them that beleeve
for if we be justified by the imputed righteousnesse of christ alone and if in us there bee nothing which receiveth or maketh us partakers of christs righteousnesse but faith onely then there is nothing in us by which we are justified but onely faith
but because the papists object heresie and novelty against us in this point will besides some few places of scripture and some other reasons briefly propounded produce the testimonies of the fathers and others who have in all ages lived in the church before these times


vii
first therefore rom

the word gratis freely being an exclusive particle doth import that we are justified by the grace of god and merits of christ through faith without righteousnesse in us and therefore by faith alone

secondly gal


we know that by the workes of the law that is the righteousnesse and obedience prescribed in the law in which all inherent righteousnesse is fully and perfectly described a man is not iustified undefined span alphabet no otherwise but by faith non nisi per fidem as bishop iustinian

or by faith onely as henry steven who well understood the greek translateth it sed tantùm per fidem

thirdly rom

the exclusive is implyed
to him that worketh nor but hath beleeved that is hath onely beleeved in him who justifieth sinners his faith is imputed unto righteousnesse and so the syriack paraphrast readeth but hath onely beleeved
fourthly
mar

luk

onely beleeve

to this bellarmine

answeareth that christ speaketh of the miraculous raising of a dead body and not of the justification of a sinner for as for the obtaining of a miraculous cure he confesseth that faith doth

suffice alone
thus bellarmine in that place to serve his present tume
but in the seventeenth

chapter of the same booke where hee would prove that faith doth justifie not relatively in respect of the object but by its owne efficacie hee alleageth that the woman of

canaan procured her daughters health by the efficacie of her faith and rejecteth his owne answere in the other place
neither may it bee answered saith he that it is one thing to speake of justification and another of the curing of a bodily disease
for our lord by the very same words attributeth vtramque sanitatem the health both of the body and the soule to faith
for as he said to the woman who was a sinner luk

thy faith hath saved thee so to the woman which had the bloudy issue mat

thy faith hath saved thee and to the blinde man whom he restored to sight mar

thy faith hath saved thee
and further it is to bee thought that our saviour when he telleth them whom he cured that their faith had saved them that is himselfe

through faith had saved them looked higher than to the cure of their bodies as mat

sonne be of good cheere thy sinnes are forgiven thee for sinne being the cause of their maladies the lord to cure them tooke away the cause thereof which was the guilt of sinne


viii
all those places which exclude workes from justification

doe by necessary consequence teach justification by faith alone
for that we are justified by some righteousnesse is confessed of all
this righteousnesse is either the righteousnesse of faith or of workes that is either the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith and that is the righteousnesse of god which without the law is revealed in the gospell or that righteousnesse which is inherent in our selves prescribed in the law
for neither can a third righteousnesse bee named by which we should be justified neither can wee be justified by both the holy ghost perpetually making such an opposition betweene them as that they cannot stand together
if therefore we be not justified by the righteousnesse of workes prescribed in the law as all inherent righteousnesse is then we are justified by the righteousnesse of faith alone
or thus the righteousnesse whereby wee are justified is either inherent in our selves and performed by our selves which the scriptures call the righteousnesse of workes or that which being out of us is inherent in christ and by him performed for us which is the righteousnesse of faith
a third cannot be named and by both wee cannot be justified
if therefore we be not justified by the former which have sufficiently or rather abundantly proved heretofore then are we justified by the latter alone
for if of two and no more but two you take away one you leave the other alone
so is it in all consisting of two opposites sine medio
the one being removed the other only remaineth


ix
that by which alone the promise of justification by which alone justification by which alone christ himselfe who is our righteousnesse is received that alone justifieth
by faith alone the promise by it alone justification by it alone christ himselfe is received
for that is the

proper office of faith
for if faith receive the promise and justification and christ himselfe which no other grace in us can doe then it is the proper office of faith
but faith receiveth the promise wherein justification is offered gal


it receiveth remission of sinnes or justification act






it receiveth christ himselfe ioh

which no other grace can doe as it is evident therefore faith alone doth justifie


that which is the onely condition of the covenant of grace by that alone we are justified because to that alone justification is promised

faith is the onely condition

of the covenant of grace which is therefore called lex

fidei therefore by faith alone we are justified

if against the assumption it be objected that charity and obedience and other virtues are also required answere that these are not the conditions of the covenant but the things by covenant promised to them that beleeve
if we beleeve god hath promised to justifie us and being justified or redeemed to sanctifie and to save us

charity obedience are the conditions of the covenant of workes doe this and thou shalt live but the condition of the covenant of grace is beleeve and thou shalt bee inabled to walke in the obedience of the law thou shalt receive the gift of the spirit and finally thou shalt bee saved

xi
the holy scriptures wheresoever they speake of that by

which wee are justified mention nothing in us but faith not workes nor other graces unlesse it bee to exclude them from the act of justification
which is a plaine evidence that faith doth justifie alone
bellarmine answereth that it doth not follow that because faith onely is mentioned therefore it justifieth alone
for sometimes other things as not only other virtues but the sacraments also are mentioned which notwithstanding doe not justifie alone
whereunto answere first that in the point of justification faith is mentioned alone and no other grace with it even where the holy ghost treateth ex professo of justification and of the causes thereof
secondly that to no other grace mentioned either alone or with others is justification any where ascribed
neither are the papists able to produce any testimony out of the holy scriptures to prove it
as for those which bellarmine

alleageth out of tit

ephes


they are not to the purpose as speaking of the outward meanes which we deny not to concurre with faith
that out of luk

hath already beene cleared

that love there noteth not the cause but the signe of forgivenesse
that out of rom

sheweth that in this life we are not saved re but spe not in fruition but in expectation
which hope or expectation as it is termed vers
is no cause either of justification or of salvation
thirdly that the justification attributed to sacraments doth not hinder justification by faith alone
for when wee say that faith doth justifie alone we meane that nothing in

us doth concurre to the act of justification as any cause thereof but faith onely as hath beene shewed
as for the sacraments we acknowledge them to be externall meanes and as it were manus offerentis as faith is manus recipientis
and that the sacraments bee so farre srom hindering justification by faith alone as that they doe confirme it as being the seals of that righteousnesse which is by faith

chap
ix testimonies of the ancient fathers and of others in all ages for justification by faith alone

now that this doctrine is no novelty but that which in all ages hath been the received doctrine of the christian churches will prove by the testimony of the christian writers in all ages but chiefly of the ancient fathers

iustin martyr

undefined span alphabet
to see

god it is granted men by faith alone
and by what alone wee see god by that alone wee are justified
againe

what other thing could cover our sinnes but his righteousnesse in whom could we being sinners and impious bee justified but in the onely sonne of god
by the righteousnesse therefore of christ onely which is received and put on by faith onely are our sinnes covered
in christ alone those that are sinners in themselves are justified therefore not by righteousnesse inherent but onely by the righteousnesse of faith

origen more plainely

the apostle saith that the justification which is by faith alone is sufficient so that a man beleeving only is justified and instanceth in the examples of the penitent theefe luk
and of the penitent woman luk
both which were justified by faith alone
and in that place as hath beene observed by others origen useth the exclusive particle sola seven times
bellarmine answereth

that origen only excludeth externall workes when power and occasion is wanting as in the theefe upon the crosse
repl
but it evident that as paul so also

origen speaketh of workes in generall and that in the penitent theese and in that penitent woman good workes were not wanting
for the theee

reproeth his fellow confesseth his sinne acknowledgeth christs innocencie professeth christ in his most despicable eate when his owne disciples ed prayeth unto christ to remember him when he should come to his kingdome
the woman

brought an alabaster box of ointment stood behinde christ weeping washed his fee with her teares wiped them with the haires of her head kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment by which actions shee ttified her faith in christ her repentance for her innes her love to her saviour acknowledged by christ himselfe to have beene great
yet not by these good workes but onely by their faith were those two persons justified
and no marvell
for even abraham himselfe though he abounded with good workes yet he was not justified by them but by faith onely
yea but saith bellarmine origen doth not exclude love and repennce
repl
no mre doe we from the subject that is the partie justified but from the act of justification
for although they doe not concurre with faith to the act of justification as any cause thereof yet they must eoncurre in the subject that is the partie justified as necessary fruits of faith and unseparable companions of justification

cyprian

hilari it

the scribes that sinne should be forgiven by a man for they saw no more in christ but a man and that to

and againe

qia sola justificat and yet againe

hac sola fides confess christum dei filium omnium beatitudinm glriam merit in petr
this faith alone confessed that christ is the sonne of god obtained in peter the glory of all blessednesse
to the first bllarmine answereth that the particle alone excludeth onely the law which hath no place in the other two
but if the law be excluded which the rule of all inherent righteousnesse it proveth justification only by faith
for if men be justified either by the legall righteousnesse or by th evangelicall and a third cannot be named then it followeth that if men have not nor can have remission of sinnes and justification by the law that is by inherent righteousnesse which is prescribed in the law thn they must have it according to the gospell that is by the righteousnesse of christ received by faith onely but the former is true act


therefore the latter

viii asill this is perfect

and entire glorying in god when a mn being not lifted up for his own righteousnesse knoweth indeed himselfe to want true justice undefined span alphabet but to bee justified by faith alon in christ
answereth that basil excludeth

onely workes done without faith or the grace· of god
reply
but basill mentioneth not workes going before grace but speaketh of a man already justified who then doth intirely glory in god when being not lifted up with a conceit of that righteousnesse which is in himselfe but being conscious to himselfe of his defectivenesse in respect of inherent righteousnesse acknowledgeth himselfe to be justified onely by faith in christ

ix gregory nazianzene speaking

of those words rom



undefined span alphabet for it is righteousnesse to beleeve onely

saint ambrose or whosoever else as ancient as he was the authour of the commentaries on the epistles of paul whom the papists use to cite under the name of saint ambrose and of bishop ambrse when they meet with any thing that seemeth to make for them
sixus senensis

doth not only acknowledge them to be ambrose his commentaries but also commendeth them as being breves quidem in verbis sed sententiarum pondere graves
he in very many places ascribeth justification to faith alone
ellarmine saith he excludeth the workes of the ceremniall law or the necessity of externall workes which may serve perhaps for a poore shift to avoid some few places but not the most

as first in rom

they are justified saith he gratis that is freely because nihil operantes neque vicem redentes sola fide justificati sunt don dei that is without workes either going before or following after they are through the gift of god justified by faith only

secondly in rom
how can the iewes who looke to be justified by the workes of the law thinke that they are justified with the justification of abraham cum videant abraham non ex operibus legis sed sola fide justificatum when they see abraham to have beene justified not by the workes of the law but onely by faith
non erg pus est lege quando impius per solam fidem justificatur apud deum
there is no need therefore of the law seeing a sinner is justified before god by faith alone

thirdly and on those words of th fifth according to the latine secundum propositum sic decetum dicit deo ut cessante lege solam fidem dei psceret ad saltem
fourthly he pronounceth them blessed whom god hath ordained that without any labour or observation sol fide justificantur apud de they should be justified before god by faith alone

seventhly in rom

he noteth the improvident presumption of the iewes who thought that men cannot be justified without the workes of the law cum sciant abraham qui forma ejus rei est sine operibus legis per solam fidem justificatum when themselves know that abraham who is the patterne or samplar of that matter to have been justified by faith alone without the workes of the law

xi hierome or what other writer no lesse ancient was the authour

of the commentaries on paul's epistles in very many places teacheth justification by faith alone
bellarmin

saith that pelagius was the authour of those commentaries
but this appeareth to be false by those places which augustine citeth out of the commentaries of pelagius in his three first chapters of his third booke de peccatorum meritis remissione
deny not but that divers sentences are found in those commentaries rankely savouring of the pelegian heresie as well as in the writings of other ancient fathers either because before the pelagian hersie was spred they wrote more caresly of those points or rather because the pelagian hereticks did corrupt their writings which possevin himselfe suspecteth might have happened to this author
these commentaries doe seeme to have been in great account in the church above yeares agoe in that sedlius in his collectanea and sometimes by name

as cor

and primasius in his commentaries on the epistles were not ashamed to borrow store of annotations out of these commentaries as in other points so in this which have in hand as may appeare by collation of those which shall cite out of them
the author of the ordinary glosse who lived eight hundred yeers ago every where citeth them under the name of hierome
for my part suspect that bllarmine and other papists doe not so much distaste this writer for comming too neere the pelagians as for his too much departing from themselves meane especially in this question of justification freely by the grace of god through faith alone in christ to which purpose there are more frequent and more pregnant testimonies in these commentaries than in any other work of the like quantity of any ancient writer whatsoever and although these commentaries have beene interpolated by the pelagian hereticks yet those testimonies which shall alleage for

iustification by faith alone the papists themselves will free from suspicion of pelagianisme
thus therefore he writeth

first in ro

on those words iudaeo sive quod justum fuerit ut quomodo abraham credens ex gentib per solam primum fidem salvatus est ita caeteri credentes salvarentur
sedulius hath the same but leaveth out the word primum

tenthly there is a notable testimony cited by bishop

iustinian out of chrysostome in psal
which doth not only conclude this question against the papists but also putteth a manifest difference betwixt sanctification which consisteth of many virtues and justification unto which faith onely is required
iustitia conflatur ex multis virtutibus na virtus activa non facit justitia quemadmodum nec una tabula perficit navigium nec unus lapis domum
vna sola virtus justificat fides quae est virtutum fastigium righteousnesse is compounded of many virtues and one active virtue maketh not righteousnesse
even as one planke doth not make a ship nor one stone an house onely virtue justifieth namely faith which is the top of all virtues


serm de fide lege naturae

without faith no man hath atained to life undefined span alphabet but the thiefe on the crosse beleeving onely was justified and afterwards twice he affirmeth that undefined span alphabet faith by it selfe saved
bellarmine answereth that chrysostome teacheth that sometimes faith alone that is without externall workes doth suffice which cannot be applyed to the penitent thiefe who as shewed before wanted not for the time externall workes and yet not by them but by faith alone he was justified

xiii

impius quidem solam
for without the merits of good workes a sinner is justified and that by faith alone


apud gratianum

this is the faith which worketh by love huic duntaxat remissio delictorum promittitur to this onely remission of sins is cui soli venia promitoitu to which alone paron is quâ solâ peccata relaxantur by which alone sinnes are released

ecce sine opere justificatur exfide quicquid illi legali posset observatione conferri totum credulitas sola dnavit
behold without workes he is justified by faith and whatsoever might bee conferred upon him by the observation of the law all that faith alone bestowed


in ioan

on those words you heare not because you are not of god this was spoken to them who where not onely vicious by sinne but also foreknowne that they were not to beleeve ea fide qua solâ possent peccatorum obligatione liberari with that faith by which alone they might be delivered from the bond of their sinnes


out of his sermons de verbis domini this testimony is usually cited
medicina animae omnium vulnerum una propitiatio pro delicts credere in christum
the medicine for all wounds of the soule and the onely propitiation for all sinnes is to beleeve in christ


ad duas epistolas pelag

quantaelibet fuisse virtutis ntiquos praedices justos non eos salvos fecit nisi fides mediatoris qui in remissionem peccatorum sanguine fudit bellarmie answereth that in this place are excluded onely nature and the law of moses
reply but the place is plaine that though the virtue of the ancient fathers were never so great yet neither it nor any thing else could save them but onely faith in christ


lib
quaest

if any when hee hath beleeved shall presently depart out of this life the justification of faith abideth with him neither for his precedent good workes because not by merit but by grace hee came unto it nor for the subsequent because he is not suffered to remaine in this life
and therefore say we by faith alone
to this bllrrmine answereth that augustine speaketh of a lively faith as though wee

spake of any other for augustine there saith that a man is justified without workes going before faith but that justifying faith is such a faith as worketh by love
bellarmine then confesseth that a lively faith which worketh by love doth justifie alone
as for that which is not lively nor accompanied with charity we teach that it justifieth neither alone nor at all
thus hath hee indevoured in vaine to answere some allegations out of six of the fathers
the rest either of the same authors or of others either before named or now to bee cited remaine unanswered saving foure others which because he would have men thinke we want testimonies of antiquity hee hath afforded us out of his owne store
which wee will examine in their due place
and in stead of the first which hee citth out of cyrill of alexandria

being to no purpose

and yet falsified by him for cyrill doth not say hominem per solam fidem inhaerere christo as bellarmine citeth him and being also false in that sense for which indeed our prevaricator doth alleadge him that a man may abide in christ by faith and yet want love and perish but in stead of this will requite him with another of the same authour in the same commentaries upon iohn on those words ioh


ye beleeve in god beleeve also in me per fidem namque saith he non aliter servamur by faith we are saved and not otherwise that is by faith alone

xvi
to cyrill we adjoyne

sedulius as being of the same time as bellarmine following trithemius supposeth hee wrote saith bellarmine an explanation upon all the epistles of saint paul taken out of origen ambrose hierome and augustine meaning those commentaries of ambrose and hierome which before cited
whereby it may appeare that those commentaries in the time of sedulius were of good esteeme for out of those very commentaries of hierome he hath collected many briefe passages as in other matters so in this particular
as hierome therefore had said in rom

so saith hee almost in the same words justiia dei est

quod justum fuerat ut quomodo abraham credens ex gentib per solam fidem justificatus est ita caeteri fidem ejus imitantes salvarentur


in rom

convertentem impium per solam fidem justificat deus
and on those words of the latine edition secundum propositam gratiam that is saith he as hierome had said before quo gratis proposuit per solam fidem dimittere peccata

in rom

the blessednesse of man he calleth remission of sins by faith
it is a great blessednesse without the labour of the law and penitence to obtaine the grace of god by faith alone
which words are in part taken out of ierome on the same place

in rom

on those words secundum propositum secundum quod proposuit salvare sola fide according to which he purposed to save by faith alone those whom he foreknew should beleeve whom also he freely called to salvation which word for word are taken out of ierome


in rom

moses put a difference betweene either justice to wit of faith and of workes because the one by workes the other

sola credulitate justificet accedentem by faith alone justifieth him that commeth and so ierome on the same place out of whom also hee reciteth word for word that which before cited out of him in rom

now hee doth plainely demonstrate that faith it selfe alone hath in it the power of justifying
bellarmine answereth for this is the third place which hee would seeme to afford us out of his owne store that his meaning is that without faith nothing doth justfie
but the meaning is plaine not that other things cannot justifie without faith but that faith alone without the helpe of other things is able to justifie

speaking of mark


courteously he did not repeate but he that is not baptized shall bee condemned but onely he that beleeveth not intimating that faith sometimes alone is sufficient to salvation but without it nothing doth suffice

to the former hee answereth that bernard speaketh de viva fide of a lively faith as though we spake of any other
if hee confesse that a lively faith doth justifie alone it is all that wee seeke
for as for the dead faith wee confesse that it justifieth neither alone nor at all
and therfore attribute lesse unto it than the papists themselves

to the other hee answereth that the word solam excludeth onely the necessity of baptisme in the case of necessity
reply if sometimes it doth suffice alone to salvation then much more to justification and if baptisme which is manus dantis bee excluded then by the like reason all

other things which are in us are excluded from the act of justification

curse against all those who shall say that a man is justified by faith alone
and yet even since that councell the force of this truth hath expressed from the professed enemies of the gospell a confession thereof

ben
iustinianus in his paraphrase on gal


hee rendreth it thus
and yet wee are not ignorant that a man is not justified by the workes of the law sed per unum iesu christi fidem but by the only faith in christ and in his explanation he giveth this sence because we who are by nature iewes cannot be justified by the law sed per solam fidem but by faith alone it followeth that no mortall man can obtaine righteousnesse by the workes of the law sed solm ex iesu christi fide but only by the faith of iesus christ
yea bellarmine himselfe

saith that to us the merits of christ are applyed by the sacraments hebris per solum fidem to the hebrewes by faith alone
but the faithfull among the hebrewes were justified no otherwise than abraham was justified
and as abraham

the father of all the faithfull

who was the forme and samplar of this thing was justified so are wee
but abraham was justified by faith alone therefore wee also are justified by faith onely

neither is the justification by sacraments repugnant to justification by faith alone the meaning of our assertion being this that in us nothing concurreth to the act of justification as any cause thereof but faith onely
for being justified by faith alone as abraham was the sacraments are added as circumcision was to him as seales

of that righteousnesse

which we have by faith
so that faith onely justifieth before god as the hand of the receiver but the sacraments serve to justifie the faithfull in the court of their conscience by sealing and assuring unto them their justification

chap
bellarmines arguments that faith doth not justifie alone first because it doth not dispose alone to justification there being seven dispositions whereof faith is but one and namely the first



now let us see what arguments bellarmine doth

bring to prove that we are not justified by faith alone
which question in his opinion may bee

disputed three wayes either with relation to the time going before justification or to the time of justification or to the time following our justification
in respect of the first the question which he maketh is whether faith doth justifie alone by way of disposing unto justification
in respect of the second whether faith be the onely formall cause of our justification
in respect of the third whether for the retaining and preserving of righteousnesse good workes be not required but faith onely sufficeth
the first he disputeth de justif

and in the twelve chapters following to the end of that booke
the second that faith is not the onely and entire formall cause of justification he disputeth in the second booke
the third he disputeth in the fourth booke chap

where he endevoureth to prove that good workes doe justifie
but in mine opinion hee should rather have disputed this question whether faith doth justifie at all or not
for whereas they make two justifications the first habituall whereby of a sinner a man is made just the second actuall whereby a man of just is made more just by their doctrine faith doth not justifie as a part either of the one or the other but is required as a necessary companion and as it were causa sine qua non which is no cause
for they make the formall cause of their first justification which they say truely is but one to be charity and the meritorious cause of the second to be good workes
onely that charity and those good workes must not be without faith
all which they ascribe to faith is that they make it the beginning of justification and a disposition to it
neither doe we deny but that true faith is the beginning and the root of sanctification and of all inherent righteousnesse insomuch that from it both charity it

selfe tim


and all other both internall graces and externall obedience doe spring but the act of justification neither in the first nor second doe they ascribe to faith
onely unto the first justification they require it as a preparative disposition for the habit of grace to bee infused which doth not differ from charity and when it is infused to be a companion thereof
and to the second as causa sine qua non without which workes doe not justifie


ii
but to come to bellarmines large discourse the greatest part

thereof seemeth to bee impertinent and besides the purpose
but to make all seeme pertinent he maliciously calumniateth us as if we held all those assertions which hee with such eagernesse doth confute
but if we doe hold that faith doth not justifie by way of disposing either alone or at all and that it is not the formall cause of justification either alone as the entire cause or at all as any part thereof and that it is not a consequent of justification at all as works indeed are to what end doth all this dispute serve unlesse it be to make their seduced catholiks who never are permitted to read any of our writings to beleeve that he hath doughtily confuted us


iii
and that faith doth not justifie alone by way of disposing he

endeavoureth to prove by five sorts of arguments
the first from those seven dispositions required by the councell of trent to justification among which he reckoneth faith for one
whereunto in generall answere that this whole discourse besides that it is impertinent for wee doe not hold as have said that faith doth justifie by way of disposition

either alone or at all it is also an idle speculation disagreeing from their practicke theologie and that in two respects
first to their speculative justification they require foregoing preparations and dispositions but to the obtayning of justification in deed and in practise no such things are required
for the efficacie of justifying a sinner they ascribe to their sacraments which they say doe conferre gratiam gratum facientem that is justifie ex opere operato requiring as conceive no preceding preparation or disposition in the party to be justified so hee doe not interpose the obstacle of any mortall sinne
for if foregoing dispositions were required before the sacraments then they should not justifie as have said before ex opere operato but ex opere operantis
secondly they doe teach that in their first justification charity and with it faith and hope are infused whereby a man that before was a sinner is made righteous
and that therefore a man is first justified when these are infused and that these are first infused when a man is justified and yet they tell us of a true faith true hope true love going before justification
which by their doctrine though they goe together meane faith hope and charity accompanied with other good dispositions are neither graces nor gifts of grace infused
for before or without the sacrament there is no justification which they have tyed to the sacrament and before justification as themselves say there is no grace
for if they were graces indeed as no doubt but they are where they are true and goe together accompanied with other good

dispositions then men might be justified before the receit of the sacrament as abraham was and then the sacrament to men so qualified should not conserre grace but seale it
thus to mainetaine their pernicious errour concerning the efficacie of the sacraments justifying ex opere operato whereby they have turned religion into an outward formality that faith that hope that charity which goe before the sacrament as namely in cornelius before his baptisme should be no true graces because all true justifying and saving grace is insused in the administration of the sacrament and this infusion of grace is that which they call justification
by their doctrine therefore justifying faith is that which in the very act of justification is infused and being infused doth justifie not by way of disposing but formally it selfe being informed by charity
and therefore according to their owne doctrine that faith which disposeth to justification is not justifying faith
and consequently all this discourse concerning six other preparative dispositions concurring with faith to prove that we are not justified by faith alone is besides the purpose
for that faith which they make their first preparative disposition is not justisying faith neither doth justifie otherwise by bellarmines owne confession than its next companion viz servile feare doth
but wee when we say that faith alone doth justifie speake not of a bare and naked assent which is common to the wicked which cannot justifie either alone or at all but of a true lively effectuall faith which worketh by love and therefore say againe this whole dispute of the seven dispositions is meerely impertinent


iv
but some will say doe you require no preparative dispositions

going before justification answer that in adult is we doe but that no way hindereth the truth of our assertion concerning justification by faith alone wee doe confesse that to the begetting of justifying faith preparative dispositions are ordinarily required in adultis in those who be of yeares wrought partly by private education and use of other private meanes as reading meditation conference and partly by the publicke ministery both of the law and of the gospell by which first our minds are illuminated to know god and our selves and what wee shall bee in christ if wee beleeve in him
secondly hee mollifieth our hearts and humbleth our soules ordinarily by the ministery of the law and extraordinarily by afflictions either outward or inward which are the terrours of a distressed conscience by which when the word will not serve the lord draweth men as it were with a strong hand that being thus humbled we may become fit auditours of the gospell in which the lord to the humbled and prepared soule revealeth his unspeakeable mercies in christ stirreth us up by the ministers of reconciliation to accept of his mercie in christ intreating and perswading us in the name of god and in christs stead that wee would be reconciled unto god
the holy ghost having thus knocked at the doore of our hearts at length in his good time he himselfe openeth our hearts to receive christ by faith working in our judgments a lively assent to the doctrine of salvation by christ and by it both an earnest desire in our

hearts to be made partakers of christ which is the desire of application and also in our wils a setled resolution to acknowledge him to be our saviour and to rest upon him alone for salvation which is the will and purpose of application
having thus received and embraced christ by a lively assent or beliefe and so having the condition of the promise which is faith in the next place wee proceed to actuall application by speciall faith which is farther to be confirmed by the sacraments which are the seales of that righteousnesse which is by faith and by the practise of piety or leading of a godly life whereby wee are to make as our election and calling so also our justification sure unto us



but come we to his argument drawne from the seven preparative

dispositions
and first for faith he saith he shall not need to prove that it doth justifie because we confesse it but that it doth not justifie alone
answ
that justifying saith which is a grace infused in our regeneration we deny to justifie by way of disposing that faith which goeth before regeneration and is not infused we deny to justifie at all
and such is that faith whereof he speaketh and therefore hee reckoneth without his host
from our assertion he should rather have concluded thus
that which is but a preparative disposition to justification doth not justifie at all that faith which goeth before regeneration is but a preparative disposition to justification as bellarmine teacheth therefore that faith which goeth before regeneration doth not justifie at all
or thus a preparative disposition to justification doth not justifie but faith as all confesse doth justifie therefore it is not a preparative disposition to justification


vi yea but he will prove by authority of scriptures by testimonies of fathers and by reason that faith doth not justifie alone because it is but the beginning of justification and therefore other things must accompany and follow it to perfect our justification
answ
that it is the beginning of sanctification and the root of all sanctifying graces have already confessed
but the concurrence both of other inward graces and of outward obedience unto sanctification doth not hinder but that faith doth justifie alone
neither doth faith justifie as the beginning of justification only first because there are no degrees of justification before god for in the first act it is perfect and to that act continued throughout this life faith as shewed before out of divers of the fathers sufficeth
say sufficeth to justification and therefore is not the beginning onely but also the continuance and consummation thereof for as in the first act it justifieth so also in the continuance of justification for by it we

stand and by it we live

and so long as we have faith it is imputed unto us for righteousnesse even from faith to faith

as it was to

abraham after he had long continued in the faith


vii
his first proofe is heb

hee that commeth to god

must beleeve that god is and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him
therefore faith is the first motion of comming to god which wee willingly confesse
but he should have done well to have told us what is

meant by comming unto god
for to come unto christ is to beleeve in him ioh

and if that bee the meaning of the holy ghost in this place then to come unto god is to beleeve in him by speciall faith otherwise the apostle should enunciate idem per idem
and then the meaning is this hee that would beleeve that god is his god and that he will be gracious unto him must first beleeve that god is and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him
or thus wouldest thou beleeve that christ is thy saviour then must thou first beleeve that hee is the saviour of all that truely beleeve in him
or it may be that the word come in this place is to bee expounded by the word seeking
he that will come unto god that is hee that will seeke god must beleeve that god is and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him
for these words comming returning seeking which properly betoken the actions of the body are by a metaphore

translated to the actions of the soule whereby is meant sometimes our conversion and turning unto god deut


chron


esa

cum



and if that bee the meaning of this place then nothing else can bee gathered from it but that faith is the beginning of our repentance and turning unto god
sometimes the whole study of piety whereby wee endevour to know god and to serve him
chro

if thou seeke him that is if thou endevour to know and to serve him with an upright heart and with a willing mind chron

psal

whereupon godly and religious men are said to bee seekers of the lord psal

and thus faith is the beginning of all piety and of the true worship of god
sometimes it signifieth affiance in god psal

and so faith is the cause of affiance for by faith wee have affiance eph

sometimes it signifieth invocation and calling upon the name of god so david sought god sam

viii
the next place which bellarmine alleageth viz rom



whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall bee saved
how then shall they call upon him in whom they have not beleeved and how shall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard and how should they heare without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent where bellarmine observeth this order of justification he should have said of salvation
first sending of preachers
secondly preaching
thirdly faith
fourthly invocations
fisthly salvation that is saith he justification which is as he saith the healing of the soule from the disease of sinne
of these saith he sending and preaching are without us therfore the first beginning of justification within us is faith which invocation doth follow and the rest in their order
answere first that the apostle setteth downe in order the degrees not of justification but of salvation
whereof the first after election is vocation unto which

three of these degrees are referred
first sending of preachers
secondly preaching
thirdly hearing by which faith commeth
the second is justification by faith
thirdly sanctification whereof one principall duety is mentioned viz invocation which seemeth to bee put as sometimes it is

for the whole worship of god or religion fourthly salvation
secondly in reckoning these degrees he omiteth one in favour of their implicite faith
for where the apostle saith how shall they callupon him in whom they have not beleeved how shall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard and consequently by hearing knowne this degree he leaveth out which proveth that men cannot beleeve in god who have not heard of him nor by hearing knowne him
thirdly his inference is of no force at all for by this place it is not proved that faith is the first beginning of justification but this is proved that as the word begetteth faith which doth justifie or as the apostle speaketh in other words rom
whom the lord doth call them he doth justifie so faith begetteth invocation and all other dueties of sanctification for whom god doth justifie hee doth sanctifie
now sanctification is the beginning of glorification in this life for by it the lord beginneth in us a spirituall and eternall life and as glory is gratia consummata so grace is gloria inchoata
so that from this place compared with rom

and thess


wee may be bold to set dowue the degrees of salvation in this order election vocation iustification glorification and that either begun in this life which is sanctification or consummate in the life to come which is our eternall salvation


ix
his third testimony is ioh

so many as received him to them hee gave power to be made the sonnes of god to them which beleeve in his name
where saith he saint iohn plainly teacheth that these who receive christ by faith are not yet the sonnes of god but may bee made the sonnes of god if they goe on further so that they begin also to hope and to love for love properly maketh men the sonnes of god
answ
the words are undefined span alphabet where bellarmine by undefined span alphabet which the vulgar latine readeth potestatem understandeth possibility as if he had said potentiam and the verbe undefined span alphabet which is the aorist hee understandeth as if it were the future as if the meaning were that those who receive christ by faith are in a good possibility to become hereafter the sonnes of god if to their faith they shall adde hope and love for it is love properly saith he and not faith that maketh men gods children
but the word undefined span alphabet never signifieth possibility but as in other places it is translated power or authority so here as also cor



right or priviledge or as iansenius

interpreteth authoritatem dignitatm jus
and the word undefined span alphabet doth signifie not that they may be made hereafter but that so soone as men beleeve they are already the sonnes of god hee gave them this right or priviledge this prerogative dignity or preheminence to bee the sonnes of god
and so iansenius the word undefined span alphabet may bee rendred not onely fieri to bee made but also esse to be that is now saith hee may bee the sense hee gave them that authority right

and dignity ut sint dei filii that they are the sonnes of god not onely after but when they doe receive him for of them that receive christ even by the first degree of faith it is said that they are borne of god ioh

whosoever beleeveth that iesus is christ is borne of god hee doth not say is in possibility to bee hereafter but hee speaketh in the time past undefined span alphabet hee is already borne of god and in this very place ioh

they that beleeve in christ undefined span alphabet are borne of god
for indeed regeneration in order of nature though not in time goeth before faith which the spirit when hee doth regenerate us worketh in us
iansenius well observeth that the parts of this text understood according to bellarmines sence cannot well stand together that those who are said to have received christ should have power given them wherby they may be made the sonnes of god
for if they have received him they are already the sonnes of god and need not to bee made sonnes of god
and on the contrary if they are in possibility to be made sons then now they are not and if they be not sonnes then they have not yet received him
and further he observeth that of them who are here said to have power given them to be the sons of god in the next verse it is said that they are born of god
besides those who have not yet received christ by faith are notwithstanding in possibility to be made the sons of god whiles they are capable of faith and are in possibility to beleeve
the place to which he referreth us is ioh

ye know that hee who worketh righteousnesse is borne of god from whence this may be gathered that working of righteousnesse is an evident signe or marke of him that is borne of god not that working righteousnesse is the cause to make a man gods child but an evidence to declare that hee is the child of god
for he that is borne of god committeth not sinne ioh

as a servant of sinne ioh

and hereby we doe know that we are passed from death to life that is that wee are justified because wee love the brethren ioh

hereby the sonnes of god are manifest and the sonnes of the devill hee that worketh not righteousnesse is not of god nor hee that loveth not his brother vers
hereby saith our saviour shall men know you to be my disciples if you love one another ioh

conclude with saint paul gal


by faith in iesus christ hee doth not say by love but by faith yee are hee doth not say yee may bee but yee are all that beleeve the sonnes of god upon which words as noted before thomas aquinas observeth faith alone maketh men the adoptive sonnes of god



to these places of scripture bellarmine addeth the testimonies of the fathers who if they speake as bellarmine citeth them they say nothing but what wee willingly confesse to wit that faith is as clemens alexandrinus speaketh

undefined span alphabet the first propension or inclination to salvation that it is as it were the eye of the soule and the lampe

to finde the way to salvation as cyrill of hierusalem that it is the light of the soule the dore of life the foundation of salvation as

esebius emissemus that it is the beginning of righteousnesse inherent as

chrysostome that it is the gate and the way unto life as

cyrill

of alexandria that it is the first grace in a christian as ambrose

that it is the beginning and originall of asiance and accesse to god as

ierome that wee are made the sonnes of wisedome the faith

of the mediatour preparing and working it that it is first given

and by it the rest that to a christian the true beginning

is to beleeve in christ that by faith wee obtaine grace

and by grace the health of the soule that the house of god

whereby is meant the whole oeconomy of our salvation in this life is founded on faith raised by hope and perfected by charity as augustine
that faith is the foundation of righteousnesse

which no good workes precede and from which all proceede that it is the foundation

of all vertues as prosper
that if faith bee not first begotten in the heart the rest cannot bee good as

gregory
all this and more wee affirme concerning faith but although many other graces besides faith are required unto sanctification as forerunners fitting us unto salvation yet none concurre with it to the act of justification
and although it be the beginning of sanctification and of all other graces yet it is not onely the beginner but the continuer also of sanctification purifying still the heart and working by love by which we stand by which wee live being by the power

of god through faith preserved unto salvation
and although it be termed by some the beginning as it is of inherent righteousnesse yet it alone as shewed before by diuers testimonies of the fathers sufficeth to justification
and therefore by it wee have not a partiall or inchoated but a perfect and plenary justification


xi
to these testimonies saith he naturall reason may be added and

well may hee call it naturall for there is little art in it and although it bee very simple yet it is double containing two slender proofes
the former because faith is the foundation of hope and charity but neither hope nor charity is the foundation of faith
for a man may beleeve that which hee neither hopeth for nor loveth but hee cannot hope for or love that which hee doth not beleeve
and what then therfore faith is the beginning of other graces
and what then therefore it followeth that it doth not sanctifie alone for it is but one among many but it doth not follow that therfore it doth not justifie alone
and where hee saith that faith is the foundation of hope and that a man cannot hope for that which he doth not beleeve this overthroweth a maine doctrine of the church of rome maintained by bellarmine in other places that a man may hope well for the remission of his fins and for his salvation but without speciall revelation he may not beleeve it
his second reason hath no soundnesse in it
in bodily diseases saith hee the beginning of health is for a man to beleeve that hee is sicke and to beleeve the physitian that taketh upon him to cure him and yet not that faith alone is entire health
where bellarmine compareth justification to health recovered from sicknesse to which not justification may bee compared but sanctification
for the disease of the soule as well as of the body is not onely a privation or absence of health but also an evill disposition or habit which is cured by the contrary disposition or habit for as the whole body of sinne is cured in

some measure by the grace of regeneration or sanctification so the severall members thereof as infidelity by faith despaire by hope hatred by charity pride by humility uncleannesse by chastitie drunkennesse by sobriety secondly he compareth the beleefe of a sicke man beleeving that the physitian will cure him which is no health at all nor meanes of health but in conceit for many times it proveth otherwise the promise of the physitian being deceiveable and the event uncertaine to the faith of an humbled sinner grounded on the infallible promises of god which are alwayes performed to them that beleeve

cap xi
of feare and hope being his second and third dispositions




his second disposition is feare which he proveth to dispose unto justification and to concurre thereuntn in the same manner almost as faith doth
but first this discourse is impertinent
for we deny and our deniall we have made good that justying faith doth not justifie by way of disposing
and therefore if it be proved that feare doth dispose a man to justification yet that doth not disprove justification by faith alone
for we have confessed that ordinarily in adultis there are preparative dispositions going before faith and justification whereof feare is one
but these preparatives doe not justifie and therefore for all them faith may and indeed doth justifie alone
secondly you are to understand that this feare which goeth before grace is no grace neither is it that feare which is the daughter of faith and love but the servile feare as he confesseth which is an effect and fruit of the law working on those who are under the law and keeping them in some order for feare of the whippe
neither is it properly timor dei the feare of god but metus supplicii the object whereof or the thing feared is not god but punishment or if it be of god it is not to feare him but to be affraid of him
from which our saviour hath redeemed those that beleeve that they may worship god in some measure undefined span alphabet without this feare
neither doth it per se and in its owne nature tend to justification which is the exaltation

of a sinner but rather to despaire which is the lowest dejection of a sinner
notwithstanding as the law by working this feare is a schoolemaster unto christ for when by the paedagogie of the law have learned to know their damnable estate in themselves for feare of damnation they are forced to seeke for salvation out of themselves so this feare

which in it selfe tendeth to despaire and in it owne nature affrighteth men from god as we see in the example of our first parents gen

is by god made a meanes to draw them unto him
but to say that feare doth concurre unto justification in the same manner as faith doth is against reason and against common sence unlesse hee speaketh onely of the legall faith which as it is wrought by the law so it worketh feare
for feare driveth to the humiliation faith tendeth to the exaltation of the humbled soule and by it indeed the soule is exalted
therefore as humiliation goeth before exaltation so feare before faith
againe as feare goeth before faith so sinne goeth before feare
for sinne maketh a man guilty the conscience being by the law convicted of guilt terrifieth the soule the soule terrified either sinketh in despaire being left to it selfe or prevented by god according to the purpose of his grace by which it was elected in christ seeketh to god who is found of them that sought him not
so that by this reason sinne it selfe may bee said to bee a necessary forerunner of justification disposing a man to feare more than feare doth to justification for that is a cause this but an occasion


ii
but as this discourse proving that feare is a disposition to justification is impertinent and affirming that feare concurreth to justification in the same manner that faith doth is false so are some of his allegations also impertinent
because they belong not to this servile feare which goeth before faith and and justification but to the sonnelike feare which is a fruit both of faith and love and a consequent of justification
as namely his first place it were rightly alleaged eccl



hee that is without feare cannot be justified or reputed just
for the feare of god which the sonne of syrach in that chapter from the tenth verse to the end doth so highly extoll is not this servile feare but the filiall feare by which is meant true piety it selfe which as he calleth it there the beginning so also the

crowne and fulnesse of wisedome
but the place is not rightly translated in the latine which bellarmine doth follow
for the greeke text is undefined span alphabet the wrathfull man cannot be justified or as some editions doe read undefined span alphabet unjust wrath cannot be justified according to that of iames the wrath

of man doth not worke the righteousnesse of god
and that the former part of the vers speaketh of wrath is proved by the latter which is the reason of the former undefined span alphabet for the sway of his wrath is his ruine and by the words going before where the feare of the lord is present it turneth away wrath and represseth anger


iii
so his second psal

and third prov

where it is said that the feare of the lord is the beginning of wisedome and by wisedome saith bellarmine is meant perfect justification hee should say sanctification or godlinesse
for as the wicked man is salomons foole so the godly man is the onely wise man
and in this sense moses prayeth psal

teach us lord so to number our daies that wee may apply our hearts to wisedome that is to true godlinesse and to the same purpose iob speaketh

the feare of the lord it selfe

is wisedome and so eccl

now in these places the hebrew word reshith which is translated undefined span alphabet beginning may fitly as in many other places bee translated the head that is a chiefe or principall part or the top and the meaning is that the feare of god is a principall part of godlinesse and as you heard even now eccl

the crowne of wisedome
otherwise cannot conceive how feare which is a fruit both of faith and of love should truely be said to bee the beginning of godlinesse which by consent of all is the prerogative of faith
and yet faith it selfe doth not justifie as it is the beginning of inherent righteousnesse and much lesse feare which concurreth with it not to justification but onely to sanctification
now that servile feare is not meant in these places it is evident not onely because such commendations are given unto it as belong not to servile feare but also because they that are indued with this feare are pronounced blessed psalm




prov

whereas those who have the greatest measure of servile feare are accursed and contrariewise they are happy who are most freed from it
the blessednesse promised to abraham and all the faithfull in his seed is by zachary expounded luk
to be this that being redeemed from the hand of our enemies wee should worship the lord without feare
and saint iohn testifieth that there is no feare in love but perfect love casteth out feare iohn


fourthly the feare mentioned prov

where it is said the feare of the lord is a of life to avoid the snares of death is the feare of which salomon speaketh in the words next going before
in the feare of the lord

there is strong confidence
fifthly the feare of the lord mentioned eccl

is the feare which in that chapter from the tenth verse is highly commended
of this feare it is said among other things that it is gladnesse and a crowne of rejoycing that it maketh a merry heart and giveth joy and gladnesse verse
which are things repugnant to servile feare


iv
but let us see how he proveth his unlike likenesse that servile

feare doth in a manner justifie as faith doth viz by scriptures by fathers by reason

first because as it is said of faith heb

so without feare we cannot please god
answ
this is true of the feare which is an unseparable companion of justification though bellarmines allegation of eccles


proveth it not as have shewed
but of the servile feare it may be truly said that they who please god most have the least of it
for the greater a mans love is the lesse is his feare and perfect love expelleth this feare iohn

but though without the true feare of god we cannot please him yet that doth not prove that feare doth justifie
for the like may be said of the obedience of the law of humility of charity of repentance of perseverance heb

and of the like
neither doth faith justifie because without it no man can please god but because by it alone wee receive christ in whom god is well pleased and reconciled unto us that is because by it alone wee are justified

secondly because as faith is the beginning of justice so seare is the beginning of wisedome
answ of this comparison neither part is to be understood of justification but of sanctification or righteousnesse inherent
for as faith is the mother of grace of all both internall graces and also of externall obedience so the true feare of god is a principall part of true piety
but what doth this make for servile feare which is found in them who have no grace

thirdly because as faith doth justifie by making us seeke god and to come unto him so also feare
answ
if by seeking of god be meant the worship of god then that which causeth it is the cause of sanctification
but servile feare in it selfe serveth rather to drive men from god though in the gracious dispensation of gods providence it be made sometimes a meanes to draw them to him
and this he proveth by psal

when he he slew them they sought him and psalm


fill their faces with shame and they shall seeke thy name and ion

from the example of the ninivits
the thing consesse that by servile feare men are often times forced to seeke god how beit that which is forced many times is fained as we see in the example of the israelites psal

who though by the judgements of god were brought to make semblance of repentance yet they did but dissemble for their hart was not upright with god neither were they stedfast in his covenant vers
but his proofes allow not
for the first place speaketh of gods judgments the second of shame the third of the faith of the ninivites none of feare
fourthly because as by faith christ is formed in us so by feare the protasis he proveth because paul saith gal


my little children of whom travell in birth againe untill christ be formed in you
but christ is not formed in us by justification but by regeneration whereby we are renewed according to his image the apdosis because esay saith

according to the septuagint from thy feare we have conceived and have brought forth the spirit of salvation
but why doth hee flee from the latine translation unto which hee is bound which maketh no mention of feare but onely saith we have conceived and have brought forth the spirit of health as some editions read which last words are not read together in the greeke nor in the true editions of the latine but divided by a note of distinction peperimus spiritum salutes non fecimns
thus bellarmine for his owne advantage eiteth the fomer part out of the septuagint and the later out of the vulgar latine and that corrupted when neither of both agreeth with the originall
from which if bellarmine would argue he should make himselfe very ridiculous
the words are we have conceived we have travailed we have as it were brought forth wind so pagninus vatablus tremellius salutes non fecimus in terra no salvations have we wrought on the earth which words being a complaint cannot import that they had from the feare of god which is not here mentioned brought forth the spirit of salvation
so farre is this place from proving that christ by feare is formed in us

fifthly as faith doth justifie because the just man shall live by his faith

hab

so of feare it is written that the feare of the lord is the fountaine of life prov

answ
the former place speaketh both of the life of grace which is our vivification and the life of glory to which wee are intitled by faith
the latter as have shewed speaketh of sonnelike feare which as all other habits of grace may bee called fountaines of living well which all arise from one common spring which is faith and are all not causes and much lesse preparations but fruits of faith and consequents of justification

sixthly as faith doth justifie by purging of sinnes so feare
answ
to the proposition
faith doth justifie by absolving from sins act


rom

and removing the guilt
and it purgeth also from the corruptions by sanctifying and purifying the heart act


to the reddiction that feare which expelleth sinne eccles

is as have shewed the feare of sonnes and not of slaves neither doth it concurre to justification but to sanctification



to the testimonies of the fathers affirming some of them

that feare serveth to prepare and to dispose men to sanctification and likewise to his reason that it is the nature osfeare to flee from evill and to seeke remedies whereby evill may be avoided willingly subscribe
but though feare be one meanes among many to dispose or prepare men for sanctification or yet for justification yet neither it nor any of the rest doth justifie and therefore doth not disprove justification by faith alone
legall faith working feare is a preparative to the evangelicall justifying faith but is so farre it selfe from justifying that it pronounceth accursed those that are endued therewith


vi
his third disposition is hope which he saith ariseth of faith

no otherwise than feare doth
but yet by his leave with this difference that servile feare is the fruit of a legall faith applying the threatnings of the law to a mans selfe but hope of salvation is the fruit of evangelicall faith apprehending the promises of the gospell and is therefore called the hope of the gospell col

neither can there be any sound hope of eternall life untill a man doth truely beleeve that the promise of salvation doth belong unto him and that he cannot beleeve untill he have the condition of the promise which is justifying faith and therefore of necessity justifying goeth before hope
as for that hope which goeth before justifying faith it is evident that it doth not justifie neither is it an habit of grace infused but a naturall affection such as is in all men who attempt any thing
as the apostle saith

he that ploweth ploweth in hope and hee that thresheth thresheth in hope
although therefore this hope doe dispose men to justification and sanctification as after a sort it doth in animating of men to use the meanes of grace and salvation in hope that their labour shall not bee in vaine yet for all this hope which doth not justifie at all faith doth justifie alone


vii
but let us examine his proofes which are a few testimonies

of scriptures and fathers impertinenty alleaged
his first testimony is prov

qui sperat in domino sanabitur
the second psal

salvabit eos quia speraverunt in eo
the third psal

quoniam in me

speravit liberabo eum answ
none of these three places doe speake either of justification or preparation thereunto nor of hope otherwise than as it is included in affiance which as it hath reference to the future time is all one with hope nor of hope or affiance as it goeth before but as it followeth justifying faith what therefore could be more impertinently alleaged the first

place according to the originall is but he that trusteth in the lord undefined span alphabet shall be made fat
the latine in the next verse

translateth the same words thus qui confidit and the septuagint undefined span alphabet
the second psalm


the word chasah is translated sometimes

confidere to trust sometimes and as take it in that place onely sperare to hope in the same sense of affiance those that thus trust or hope in god he delivereth them from the wicked and saveth them
but before they can either be saved or trust in god they must be justified by faith
and therefore this hope or affance is no forerunner of justification but a follower thereof

the third psalm


the hebrew chashak which by some is translated sperare by others valde or vehementer amare amore in aliquem propendere and might better have beene alleaged for love than for hope both which are consequents of justifying faith
the words then are because he hath set his love upon me therefore will deliver him he doth not say will justifie him
but let us heare bellarmines

commenting upon this place the hebrew word saith he doth signifie to adhere to love to please therefore not every hope but that affiance which proceedeth out of a good conscience and out of love and filiall adhering to god doth deliver a man


viii
his fourth testimony matth


confide fili have a good heart sonne so the rhemists translate thy sinnes are forgiven thee
for our lord faith bellarmine did not as some falsely teach justifie the man who had the palsey before he said undefined span alphabet be of good courage my sonne but contrariwise as the councell of trent very learnedly signifieth first he saith be confident my sonne and when he saw him raised up in hope of health hee added thy sinnes remittuntur tibi are forgiven thee
whereby bellarmine would signifie that by this hope or affiance the man was prepared for justification
answ
first the party and those that brought him had faith as all the three evangelists note matth


mark


luk

and therefore was justified before god for if they who brought him had faith much more he who no doubt desired them to bring him and had already his sins forgiven
secondly the verbe is undefined span alphabet in the time past and ought to be translated not as bellarm readeth remittuntur are now forgiven or in forgiving but remissasunt they are already forgiven
and by that argument our saviour putteth him in comfort that hee should be cured because his sinnes which were the meritorious cause of his sicknesse were forgiven
by which glad tydings hee would have him to be assured by speciall saith of the remission of his sinnes and in that assurance to be confident
so that although the word undefined span alphabet be confident were uttered first yet the words following containe the cause of that confidence
and therefore not onely remission of sinnes but assurance

thereof by speciall revelation went before his confidence which therefore could be no preparative disposition thereunto
and this is usuall in such consolations first to bid the party to be confident or not to feare and then to set downe the cause thereof as genes


feare not abraham am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward
esai

feare not israel for have redeemed thee
in the same ninth of matthew verse
daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole
luk

feare not mary for thou hast found grace or favour with god
luk

feare not for behold bring you good tidings of great joy and so in other places
and these were his testimonies of scriptures in which he hath found no releefe


ix
let us see what helpe the fathers will afford him
no man

saith

ambrose can well repent him of his sinnes who doth not hope for pardon
answ
hope of pardon is a motive to repentance and to the use of other good meanes whereby wee may through gods grace attaine both to justification and to sanctification
howbeit repentance belongeth to sanctification and not to justification

augustine whatsoever thou declarest so declare it that hee to whom thou speakest by hearing may beleeve by beleeving may hope by hoping may love
from whence nothing can be gathered but that as faith by which we are justified commeth by the hearing of the word as the apostle also

teacheth so from faith proceedeth hope and from both faith and hope love
so that here hope which is a fruit of justifying faith and a consequent of justification is made a disposition not to justification but to love

cyprian to those who had fallen in time of persecution giveth this advice· that they should acknowledge their grievous crime neither despairing of the lords mercy nor as yet challenging pardon viz untill they had truely repented thereof which was indeed wholesome counsell
for no man can be assured of the pardon of any crime untill he have truly repented of it vpon which words of cyprian bel larmine though he can gather nothing out of them for his purpose but that those who desire pardon must not despaire of gods mercy yet as a notable bragger he insulteth over us as if he had us at some advantage when god knoweth hee hath scarce brought any thing worth the answering
by which words saith he our adversaries are plainely refuted who begin not to repent before they are fully assured that they are highly in gods favour and are confident that they are to be ranked with the cherubin and seraphin which is an impudent and yet a witlesse slander as though wee were either so arrogant as the papists who assume to themselves perfection which we doe not or so senselesse that we should teach that men are tyed to begin their repentance when they have attained to perfection and not till then
if it be said that wee make repentance to be the fruit of faith which we define to be a full assurance of gods favour
answere that that definition agreeth onely to speciall faith
not that all speciall faith is a full assurance but that every virtue is to be defined according to the perfection of it and as it is in it selfe considered in

the abstract
otherwise we acknowledge degrees of assurance
and if any of our divines have held the speciall faith to be the onely justifying faith they are to be understood as speaking of justification in the court of conscience and as judging them onely to be justified and to have remission of sinnes who are in their owne consciences perswaded and in some measure assured thereof
but besides and before the speciall faith whereby wee are justified in our owne conscience applying the promise of the gospell to our selves a formall degree of faith is to bee acknowledged being the condition of the evangelicall promises by which we aprehend receive and embrace christ as hath been shewed and by which we are justified before god
this degree of faith in order of nature goeth before repentance though in time repentance seemeth to goe before faith as being sooner discerned
but in order of nature as well as of time repentance goeth before speciall faith
because no man can be assured of gods favour in remitting his sinnes who hath not repented thereof

cap xii
of foure other dispositions viz love penitencie a purpose and desire to receive the sacrament the purpose of a new life



his fourth disposition is love for so soone as a man

doth hope for a benefit from another as namely justificacation from god hee beginneth to love him from whom hee doth expect it
in which words there is some shew that hope disposeth to love but that love doth dispose to justification not so much as a shew
but that some love goeth before justification and disposeth thereto he endeavoureth to prove which if he could performe were to little purpose or so long as this love doth not justifie his assertion doth not disprove justification by faith alone but indeed he proveth it not though to that purpose hee produceth besides foure testimonies of scripture the authority of the councell of aurenge
his first testimony is a supposititious senrence of

an apocryphall booke
for neither is the sentence in the originall greeke nor the booke canonicall neither is the sentence it selfe to the purpose yee that feare the lord love him and your hearts shall be he doth not say justified but enlightened that is as iansenius expoundeth comforted
for they that feare god and love him are already justified by faith from which both feare and love doe spring


ii
his second testimony luk

many sinnes are forgiven

her because she loved much therefore love is the cause of forgivenesse
answer by denying the consequence
for here in the papists are many times grossely mistaken who thinke that in every aetiologie the reason which is rendred is a cause so properly called when as indeed it may be any other argument or reason as well as the cause
for undefined span alphabet the cause in a large sense doth not onely fignifie that which causeth the effect which properly is called the cause of a thing or action but also any reason which proveth the thing propounded which is a cause undefined span alphabet not of the action or thing it selfe but of the reasoning or conclusion or as wee use to say consquentiae non consequentis of the consequence not of the consequent
thus it is called the fallacie undefined span alphabet non causa pro causa when that is brought for any argument which it is not
so the word undefined span alphabet which is tra~slated redditio causae is the rendring of any reason from any argument whatsoever
for in any syllogism that which is the medium though it bee the effect of the thing is the cause of the conclusion because it is the reason which proveth it and in this sense

undefined span alphabet for which cause and wherefore is all one
thus the papists prove christs humiliation to have beene the cause of his exaltation as wee heard before

because he apostle saith therefore god exalted him thus they prove the workes of mercie to bee the cause of salvation because our saiour saith for was hungry so here that love is the cause of forgivenesse because it is said for she loved much when indeed our saviour argueth not from the cause to the effect but from the effect to the cause as is most evident
first by the parable of a creditour who having two debtors whereof the one owed him five hundred pence the other fiftie and neither of them having any thing to pay he freely forgave them both their debt
our saviour therfore demanding of the pharisee who had invited him which of these debtours would love the creditour most the pharisee truely answered suppose he to whom he forgave most which answer approved by our saviour plainely proveth that love was not the cause of forgivenesse but forgivenesse of love and the forgiveing of more the cause of greater love and the forgivenesse of lesse the cause of lesse love and consequently that the greater love was not the cause of greater forgivenesse but the effect of it
this parable our saviour applying to the pharisee that invited him as the lesse debtour and to the woman which had been a notorious sinner as the greater debtor to both which he had forgiven their debts they having nothing to pay sheweth that her greaer love was an evidence of her greater debt forgiven
secondly by the antithesis in the same verse but to whom little is forgiven hee loveth but a little
it is therefore plaine that the forgivenesse is the cause of love and the forgiving of more of more love and the forgiving of lesse of lesse love
and as lesse love is a token of the lesse debt forgiven so greater love of more forgiven hee speaketh therefore of her love not as the cause going before but as the effect following after justification


iii
and such is bellarmines argument out of ioh

we are

translated from death to life that is we are justified because we love the

brethren therefore the love of the brethren is the cause of justification
deny the consequence the love of the brethren is not the cause but the fruit of our justification whereby it may be knowne
and this appeareth manifestly out of these words which bellarmine hath fraudulently omitted
nos scimus quia translati sumus wee know that wee are translated from death to life because wee love the brethren
our loue then is not the cause of justification but a manifest signe and evidence whereby it is knowne that we are already justified for so he saith speaking in the time past undefined span alphabet that we are already passed or translated from death to life
and to the like effect our saviour speaketh luk

as if hee had said hereby it appeareth that many sinnes are forgiven her because shee loved much
but that it was not her love that justified her but her faith our saviour who had so highly commended her love doth in expresse termes testifie thy faith hath saved thee goe in peace upon which wordes of our saviour shee who was formerly justified before god by a true justifying faith which our saviour professeth and which shee testified by her love and by her repentance departed home justified in the court of her owne conscience by speciall faith and being justified by faith had peace with god


as for his allegation out of gal

that faith worketh by love it hath no colour of proofe that love disposeth unto justification but rather the contrary
for he that is indued with faith working by love is already justified


iv
the councell of aurenge hee alleageth against himselfe

for if god doe first inspire faith and love it speaketh of those who are adult that wee may faithfully require the sacrament of baptisme then are we first justified by faith and afterwards receive the sacrament as abraham did circumcision as the sacament and seal of justification by faith
and this is generally to be understood of sacraments received by them who are come to yeares of discretion that they must be endued with justifying faith when they come to receive the sacraments otherwise they receive no benefit by them
for as touching baptisme our saviour saith hee that beleeveth and is baptized shall be saved but hee that beleeveth not whether hee be baptized or not baptied he shall bee condemned
and as touching the eucharist it is certaine that no man can receive christ therein without faith which is both the hand of the soule to receive him and as it were the mouth of the soule to eat his body and to drinke his bloud
and further sacraments are seales anneed to the letters patents of gods promises in the gospell and therefore confirme or assure nothing but what is contained in the promise and upon the same conditions
the condition is faith

obiect
but you will say if a man must be justified before he receive the sacrament to what end doth hee then receive it answ that hee who is justified before god by the former degree of faith may by speciall faith confirmed by the sacrament bee justified in his owne conscience that is that hee may in some measure be assured thereof


bellarmine having produced his owne arguments hee commeth

now to answer such as he saith are ours
the first out of ioh

wee love god because he first loved us
now god loveth no man actually whom hee doth not justifie and reconcile unto himselfe in christ for untill then wee are in the state of enemies
neither doth any that is not justified nor reconciled to god in christ love him or if hee doe then doth hee love god before god loveth him
gods love therefore goeth before our justification and our justification goeth before our love of god
neither is this onely true that god loveth us before wee love him but before wee can love him aright wee must bee perswaded of his love towards us which perswasion is faith from which love proceedeth tim


bellarmine answereth that god indeed loveth men first and by loving them maketh them just but by little and little and by certaine meanes
for whom hee loveth hee first calleth to faith then he inspireth into them hope and feare and love inchoated lastly he justifieth and infuseth perfect charity
reply first that which he speaketh of making just by little and little may agree to sanctification but to justification it agreeth not for thereof there are no degrees
secondly it would bee knowne whether this beginning of charity which he saith goeth before justification bee the same which in justification is infused differing only in degree if it be not the same how is it charitas inchoata and if it be not infused as well as that in the act of justification why doth he say it is inspired if it bee the same then gratia gratum faciens is inspired before regeneration before which wee are nothing but flesh and in our flesh there is no good thing
and by this reason justification shall bee nothing else but the perfecting of that charity which before was begun neither can a man bee truely said to bee justified by charity who is not endud with perfect charity perfectly and fully expelling all sin which in this life is never perfect much lesse in incipients nor ever doth so expell sinne but that allwayes whiles wee are in our mortall bodies sinne remaineth in us
wherefore the papists doe never attaine to that which they call justification which indeed is not justification but the perfection of sanctification
or if they say they doe attaine unto it and that they have no sinne they are lyars and there is no truth in them


vi
our second argument no man can love god in any acceptable

measure unlesse hee have the spirit of god dwelling in him for love is a fruit of the spirit gal

to this purpose hee citeth for us rom

which allegation hee cannot answere because he understandeth the place of our love of god which is shed abroad into our hars by the holy ghost
now no men have the spirit of god but they who are regenerated and justified for the spirit of truth the world cannot receive
ioh

bellarmine saith this is true of perfect love but imperfect love and inchoated which even now out of the counsel of aureng he confessed to be inspired of the holy spirit may be had without the spirit but not without gods speciall helpe
which words discover unto us one of the depthes of satan in the mystery of iniquity
for the papists as they doe wonderfully extenuate originall sinne so doe they use to magnifie

the strength of nature corrupted
they doe not acknowledge that which the scriptures plainely teach that by nature

wee are dead in sinne onely they say that we are diseased with sinne and entangled and bound with the chaines of sinne so that if wee bee not holpen of god wee are not able to doe that which is good
but if god doe afford his speciall helpe then we can have faith and feare and hope and love and the other preparations
and further the privative corruption which they cannot deny to be in originall sinne they confesse by the halves or not so much for the privation which is in originall sinne is not onely of the act which they doe not wholly confesse but of the power and the habit it selfe
so that in us by nature there is a meere impotencie to that which is spiritually good in respect whereof wee have lost bonum possibilitatis as augustine teacheth
wherefore that wee may bee enabled to beleeve to hope to love to feare god to purpose amendment of life it is necessary that wee should bee not holpen or loosed but renewed regenerated created a new and raised from the grave of sinne


vii
and here am to mention two things both for the comfort

of true though weake christians and also for the detestation of popery
these beginnings of faith of hope of love of amendment of life the papists doe not acknowledge to be graces infused but the fruits of nature assisted with gods special helpe by which they being holpen of god doe prepare and dispose themselves to the grace of justification which is given to man according to their owne preparative dispositions
but forasmuch as these beginnings of faith and other vertues are not the fruits of nature for in our flesh there is no good thing and that which is borne of the flesh is flesh the very disposition of our nature being enmity against god but of the regenerating spirit the weake christians therefore though the graces of god in them are weake and small even as a graine of yet if they bee true and unfained they are to be perswaded that the lord who in his children accepteth the will for the deed will accept of them as the fruits of his spirit seeing hee professeth that hee will not quench the

smoaking flaxe nor breake the bruised reed
and surely if the spirit of god bee the author of no charity but that which is perfect then is he author of none in this life wherein wee receive but the first

fruits of the spirit


the papists doe not hold themselves to bee justified untill perfect charity bee infused into them by infusion whereof all sinne is expelled
so that in any one of them being justified no sinne remaineth
and therefore whiles sinne remaineth in them as it doth alwayes even in the best during this life they are not justified
no marvell then that papists cannot be assured of their justification seeing they may bee assured that they are never justified because they never attaine to perfect righteousnesse in this life and because sinne doth alwayes remaine in them


viii
our third argument propound thus

none that is a child of wrath and an enemy to god can love god whiles he continueth in that estate

but untill their reconciliation and justification all men are children of wrath and enemies to god

therefore before reconciliation and justification no man can love god

bellarmine answereth that a man may love god though god be angry with him which is in respect of gods children who are justified and reconciled unto him but the question is whether those that are not yet reconciled and justified can love god wee know that gods anger may stand with reconciliation
for god is angry with his dearest children when they sinne

against him and in his anger hee doth also correct them with whom notwithstanding he is reconciled for he doth correct them in love and for their good
gods children therefore may love god where they know him to be justly angry with them but they that are enemies as all are untill they be reconciled doe not love god but the very disposition of their corrupt nature is

enmity against god


ix
his fifth disposition is penitencie which as he saith is a sorow

for sinne and a detestation of it which deny not ordinarily to be a disposition in the children of god to repentance
but this is to be understood of the godly sorrow which some call contrition which is not to be found in naturall men which is a sorrow conceived not so much for the punishment deserved as for the offence of god whom they have displeased and dishonoured being so gracious a god unto them
this proceedeth from faith and from love
of this it is said cor

that undefined span alphabet godly sorrow worketh repentance never to be repented of
as for that sorrow which is conceived not for the offence of god but for the shame and punishment which follow sinne which some call attrition it is of the same nature with servile fear which though in it owne nature it rather driveth from god than draweth to him as we see in

iudas yet god is pleased sometimes to use it as a meanes to draw his elect unto him
but though contrition dispose men to repentance and attrition be used sometimes as a preparative to faith because humiliation is the way to exaltation yet neither of both justifie and therefore for all them faith alone doth justifie



but let us examine his proofes wherein though his premisses

be very weake yet his conclusion as allwayes is very confident
his proofes are these act


therefore god hath given to the gentiles penance unto life
cor

the sorrow which is according unto god worketh penance to salvation that is stable
ezek

when a wicked man shall turne himselfe from his wickednesse hee shall quicken his soule
what can be more cleare if penance be given of god unto life that is to obtaine life if sorrow for sinne undertaken for god worke penance to salvation if he which doth penance doth quicken his owne soule how doth faith alone justifie or how doth penance not justifie answ
when consider your arguments wonder at your confidence
the word which in the vulgar latine is in the two first places translated poenitentia and by the rhemists penance in the originall is undefined span alphabet which is not sorrow for

sin but repentance it selfe which importeth a change of a mans mind and disposition and is not a forerunner but a consequent of justification before god which in the first place is called repentance unto life because though it bee no cause but a consequent of justification yet it is the way to life and a necessary forerunner to glorification
the godly sorrow in the second place is commended as an excellent disposition to the renewing ofrepentance in the faithfull not to bee repented of
the third bellarmine readeth thus when a wicked man shall turne himselfe from his wickednesse hee shall make alive his soule as if a wicked man could either turne himselfe from his wickednesse or quicken his owne soule or as if a dead man could restore himselfe to life
but then is the wicked turned when god doth turne him and then is his soule quickned when god doth quicken him
the words are when the wicked turneth from his wickednesse hee shall preserve his soule from death that is as it is expounded in the next verse he shall live
howsoever this place speaketh not of any foregoing disposition but of repentance it selfe which in order of nature never goeth before justification though many times it be discerned before it as the cause many times is knowne by the effect
but not whatsoever is necessary to salvation doth justifie
all the graces of sanctification and namely repentance have their necessary use but justification is ascribed onely to faith because it is the onely instrument ordained of god to receive christ who onely is our righteousnesse


xi
his sixth disposition is a purpose and desire to receive the

sacrament by which as he conceiveth justification is conferd
answ
if we did hold with them as we doe not that the sacraments doe conferre grace ex opere operato and that without them no man could be justified and therefore also that they who would be justified· ought to desire and purpose to be made pertakers of the sacrament yet what would this hinder the justification by faith alone which if bellarmine disprove not all that hee saith is impertinent
how much more if neither the sacraments doe conferre grace according to the popish conceit nor the desire of the sacrament be a disposition to justification
all that in this case can truely be said is that forasmuch as god in his great mercy hath ordained the sacraments as effectuall meanes to confirme our faith and to seale unto us our justification that it is a signe of a prophane and unsanctified heart to neglect or to despise such holy ordinances of god


xii
his seventh disposition is the purpose of a new life and of

observing all the commandements of god without which wee ought not to be made pertakers of the sacraments
answ
this purpose of a new life is that which the scriptures call undefined span alphabet repentance which is a fruit of justifying faith and a consequent of justification
seeing therefore those adulti which come to the sacraments ought to bring with them this purpose it followeth that they ought first to be justified before god by faith as abraham was and then to receive the sacrament as a seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith
so that this purpose

though it be necessary to salvation yet neither doth justifie nor dispose to justification
the place which hee citeth out of ezek

is an exhortation to both the parts of sanctification viz mortification in those words cast from you all your transgressions vivification in those and make you a new heart and a new spirit
but of justification he speaketh not
neither are we any where exhorted thereto or to the parts thereof which are not our acts but the actions of god himselfe who onely remitteth our sinnes and accepteth of us as righteous in christ by imputation of his righteousnesse
thus much of his first principall argument taken from the seven dispositions

chap
xiii
bellarmines second principall argument that faith doth not justifie alone because being severed from love it cannot justifie




bellarmin second principall argument is this

if faith be severed from hope and love and other virtues without doubt it cannot justifie therefore faith alone doth not justifie
answ
if the meaning of his consequent be this therefore that faith which is alone doth not justifie grant the whole for though faith doe justifie alone yet that which is alone svered from charity and other graces doth not justifie as heretofore hath beene shewed
but though true justifying faith be never alone but is alwayes accompanied with other graces yet it justifieth alone though it never be without other graces yet it justifieth without them his consequence therefore deny which hee laboureth to prove thus if the whole force of justifying were in faith alone insomuch that other virtues though present conferre nothing to justification then faith might justifie as well in the absence as in the presence of the rest but that it cannot doe therefore the force of justifying is not wholly in faith but partly in it and partly in the rest
answ
this consequence also doe deny and doe referre you to the similitude of the eye heretofore propounded which though it be not alone yet doth see alone and though whiles it liveth it cannot be severed from the other parts of the body yet it seeth without them against which similitude bellarmine might as well argue after this manner
if the whole force of seeing were in the eye alone insomuch that the rest of the members being present conferre nothing to the act of sight then the eye might see as well in the absence as in the presence of the rest
but every body knoweth the inconsequence of this proposition
for though to the act of seeing other members doe not concurre with the eye as any causes thereof yet to

the true being of the eye their presence is necessary for it cannot be a true living organicall eye and instrument of sight that hath not union with the other parts and is not animated by the same soule
even so answere concerning faith that although to the act of justifying other graces doe not concurre with faith as any causes thereof yet to the true being of faith their presence is necessary
for it cannot be a true lively justifying faith which is severed from all other graces of sanctification and is not wrought and made effectuall by the spirit of regeneration


ii
now he commeth to prove the antecedent of his argument viz that conditionall proposition if faith may be separated from hope and love and the other virtues withot doubt it cannot justifie
but he unskilfully troubleth both himselfe and his reader with his conditionall proposition which as it is not fitly made the antecedent of an enthymeme so is it not easily concluded
an enthymeme is an unperfect syllogisme which is to be made up or perfected by adding that part of the syllogisme which is wanting
in this enthymeme though the antecedent be a conditionall proposition yet the proposition or major of the syllogisme which also is conditionall is wanting and ought thus to be supplyed if faith alone doth justifie then it may justifie being severed from hope and love and other virtues
but it cannot justifie being severed from hope and love and other virtues therefore faith doth not justifie alone in stead of this simple or categoricall assumption he assumeth hypothetically if faith be severed from hope and love and other virtues then without doubt it cannot justifie
this assumption he endevoureth to prove by three arguments but to no purpose
for though we doe constantly hold that faith doth justifie alone yet wee deny that faith being alone and severed from all other virtues doth justifie either alone or all and therefore to that faith which is alone we attribute lesse than the papists themselves
but he will needs prove it first because faith according to our doctrine doth justifie relatively and consequently faith and justice are relatives ther fore where faith is there must needs jstice he mneth justice inherent for one relative cannot be withot the other
this saith he or adversaries will admit willingly who teach that by every sin faith is lost


iii
answ
we doe indeed teach that faith doth not justifie

as it is an habit or gift inherent in us or in respect of its owne worthinesse but relatively or in respect of the object which it doth receive
as the hand which receiveth the almes releeveth the poore man in respect of the almes which it doth receive
and yet doe not conceive that therefore the hand and the almes be relatives
but we confesse that justifying faith is not without his object yet that object by apprehening wherof it justifie reltively is not righteousnesse inherent as here bellarmine against his owne conscience doth suggest but the righteousnesse

of christ by which wee are justified betweene which and faith there is such a relation that as justifying faith is called the faith of christ or faith in christ faith in his bloud so the righteousnesse of christ by which wee are justified is called the righteousnesse of faith
and further confesse that whosoever is justified by righteousnesse imputed is also in some measure just by righteousnesse inherent though he be not justified before god thereby
but whereas he saith that wee will easily admit this argument that where faith is there is also inherent justice and consequently that justifying faith cannot be severed from other virtues because wee teach that by every sinne faith is lost doe much marvell at his impudency for though he and his consorts doe wickedly teach that by every act of infidelity faith is lost yet wee are so farre from granting that faith is lost by every sinne that we confidently hold that true justifying faith is never totally or finally lost by any sinne whatsoever that is incident to the faithfull and regenerate man
some indeed have taught that by hainous offences which doe vastare conscientiam waste the conscience faith is lost yet that is farre from saying it is lost by every sinne

secondly againe saith he if faith doth justifie relatively then it cannot be in a mans minde but justice also must be there and without love there is no justice
answ
without love there is no justice inherent but that is not it to which faith when it justifieth hath relation but that which faith having justified us bringeth forth in us as a consequent of justification
thirdly moreover saith he if faith severed from all other virtues doe justifie alone then it may also justifie being accompanied with those vices which are contrary to those virtues
but this cannot be imagined that a man should be justified and yet remaine a wicked man
answ
if by vices he understand certaine vicious dispositions which though they doe not reigne in the faithfull yet remaine in them as their infirmities confesse that justifying faith may and doth stand with such
but if he meane the contrary habits of sinne which reigne in the hearts of the wicked and impenitent sinners professe that justifying faith cannot stand with such
for where these doe reigne the man is wholly unregenerate and where regeneration is not there faith which by regeneration is wrought cannot be
it is therefore against the nature and being of a true justifying faith to harbour in a soule unregenerate


iv
to this argument he saith we answere that they assume that

which is impossible viz that faith may be alone which beleeve not to have beene the answere of any of our doctors for a man arguing undefined span alphabet may suppose that which is impossible and yet the argument be of no lesse force
but our assertion that faith cannot be alone which before have made good in the second chapter of this booke and defended against bellarmines objections chap
hee laboureth

here to take away by three reasons first by cavilling with luther and calvin
first

luther saith that faith justifieth both before and without charity
rejoyne it justifieth before because in order of nature it goeth

before without because though charity be present with it yet it justifieth without it even as the eye though the eare be with it yet seeth without it
secondly

calvin saith that the seed of faith remaineth in the greatest falles of the faithfull and therefore without charity
rejoyne calvin saith no more than iohn doth

that the seed of god doth alwaies remaine in those that are borne of god which seed of god is as well the seed of charity as of faith and both the one and the other remaine in the greatest fals of gods children as wee see in peter in whom though he fell most grievously in denying and sorswearing his lord yet the seeds yea the habits of faith and love did remaine as have proved

elsewhere

secondly saith he because our argument assumeth not that faith may be alone but that if faith did justifie alone it would doe so though it were alon this reason doth not confute our assertion that faith cannot be alone but taketh away that answere which he falsely thinke assigneth to us
but this consequence of his have denied and disproved

his third reason which is but the second to disprove our assertions if it bee true saith he that true faith is never alone then it is because faith begetteth those other graces even as a good tree bringeth forth good fruit
and if this were so then faith should goe before love and other graces if not in time yet in nature
but faith cannot be conceived to be in nature before justification or justice infused or those graces wherein justification consisteth because these are relatives as they say god justifying and faith receiving justification for relatives are simulnatura answ
the relatives that we meane are christs righteousnesse imputed of god and faith apprehending or receiving it which though they bee simul natura in respect of the one to the other yet both of them are before the other graces in order of nature
but if justifying faith be before charity and there be no righteousnesse without charity then saith he the same man may be just and not just at the same time
answ
it followeth not
for though in order of nature faith be before love tim


yet in time they goe together
neither is that such an absurdity as he imagineth that the same man at the same time should be a sinner in himselfe and righteous in christ a sinner according to the law because he hath broken it but righteous according to the gspell because in christ he hath fulfilled the law
christ being the end of the law

to every one that beleeveth insomuch that every one that beleeveth in christ is reputed as if he had fulfilled the law
lastly because saith he it is false which they hold that faith cannot be severed from charity and other virtues and this he taketh upon him to prove in the next

chapter unto which have fully

answered in the second question concerning the nature of faith

chap
xiv bellarmines third principall argument from the removall of those causes which may be given why faith doth justifie alone




hhis third principall argument is taken from the removall

of those causes he meaneth reasons which may be given why faith alone doth justifie
all which as he saith may be reduced to three heads
the first is the authority of gods word
for if the scriptures any where expresly say that faith alone doth justifie it must he beleeved though no other cause could be rendred

the second is the will of god justifying namely because it hath pleased god to grant justification upon the onely condition of faith
the third is the nature of faith it selfe because it is the propery of faith alone to apprehend justification and to apply it unto us and to make it ours
besides these have rendred other causes the chiefe and principall whereof is this because we are justified not by any righteousnesse inherent in our selves but onely by the righteousnesse of christ which being out of us in him is imputed onely to them that beleeve and is received onely by faith


ii
but these three causes or reasons which he mentioneth will not

easily be remov'd the first the authority of the scriptures this being the maine doctrine of the gospell
yea but saith bellarmine it is no where said in expresse termes that faith alone doth justifie when we saith he have expresse termes that a man is justified by workes and not by faith onely iam

answ
to the place in the epistle of iames shall answere fully in his due

place
onely here say thus much
that saint iame speaketh not of the justification of a sinner before god by which he is made or constituted just of which our question is but of that whereby a just man already justified before god may be approved declared and knowne both to himselfe and others to be just
and that the apostle iames speaketh not either of workes as causes but as signes of justification or of the habit of true faith but of the profession of faith or faith professed onely and concludeth that a man is justified that is knowne and approved to be just not onely by the profession of the true faith but by workes also a godly conversation being as it were the life and soule of the profession and without which it is dead
but though in expresse tearmes it be not said in so many words and syllables that faith doth justifie alone yet this doctrine is by most necessary consequence deduced from the scriptures
and what may by necessary

consequence be deducted out of the scriptures that is contained in the scriptures as all confesse
wherunto may be added that the fathers so conceived of the doctrine of the scriptures who with one consent as you have heard

have taught according to the scriptures that by faith we are justified alone
and the papists must remember that by oath they are bound to expound the scriptures according to the co~sent of the fathers


iii
now that this doctrine is contained in the scriptures

have plentifully proved before

and something here shall bee added
there are but two righteousnesses onely mentioned in the scriptures by which wee can bee justified either that which is prescribed in the law which is a righteousnesse inherent in our selves and performed by our selves or that which is taught in the gospell which is the righteousnesse of christ inherent in him and performed for us
the former is the righteousnesse of the law or of workes the latter is the righteousnesse of faith
a third righteousnesse by which wee should bee justified cannot be named
and betweene these two there is such an opposition made in the scriptures that if wee bee justified by the one we cannot by the other
if therefore the scriptures teach that wee are justified by faith and not by workes it is all one as if they said that wee are justified by faith alone
if it bee all one to say by faith and not by the workes of the law or by faith alone then saith bellarmine demand whether

all workes and every law be excluded or not
for if all workes be excluded then faith it selfe which ioh

is the worke of god and if every law then the law of faith and consequently faith it selfe and so to be iustified by faith shalbe nothing else but to be justified without faith
answ it is plaine that by the law is meant the law of workes and by the workes of the law all that obedience which is prescribed in the law
now in the law which is the perfect rule of righteousnesse all inherent righteousnesse is prescribed
then saith bellarmine faith it selfe and the act of faith is excluded from the act of justification
answere first in this question the apostle opposeth faith to workes

and therefore faith is not included under workes
secondly faith as it is either an habit or an act and so part of inherent righteousnesse doth not justifie but as hath beene said relatively in respect of the object which being received by faith doth justifie as it was the brsen serpent apprehended by the eye which did heale and not the eye properly


iv
againe the scriptures teach that we are justified gratis gratiâ

per sanguinem christi per fidem
gratis that is freely without respect of any good workes done by us no not by the workes of righteousnesse which wee have done tit

but by his meere grace and favour when we had deserved the contrary through the bloud and alone satisfaction of christ received onely by faith
to the word gratis bellarmine answereth that it excludeth our owne merits which indeed can be none but not the free gifts of god as love and penitencie and the like for then faith also should be excluded
that followeth not for when wee are justified by faith onely we are justified gratis gratis saith the apostle freely by his grace through the merits of christ by faith bringing onely faith to justification

as the fathers have taught and that not to bee any essentiall cause of our justification but onely to be the instrument and hand to receive christ who is our righteousnes and therfore it is the condition required on our part in the covenant of grace
the rest as love and hope and repentance being not the conditions of the covenant but the things by covenant promised to them that beleeve
vpon the condition of faith which is also the free gift of god the lord promiseth remission of sins and justification and to those who are redeemed and justified by faith he doth by oath promise the graces

of sanctification
so that faith only on our part is required to the act of justification besides which we bring nothing else thereunto but love and the rest of the graces as augustine saith of workes non precedunt justificandum sequuntur justificatum and therefore wee are justified by faith alone



and by this the second head is also proved namely that it is the

good pleasure of god to grant justification upon the condition of faith alone
if ye looke into all the promises of the gospell ye shall find that they interpose only the condition of faith
see act






ro

gal


and so every where
before the incarnation of christ it was the good pleasure of god by faith onely to justifie the faithfull as bellarmine himselfe hath confessed
and doth he require any other condition of us are not we justified as they were by his knowledge that is by faith in him

my righteous servant shall justifie many

yea but the scriptures saith bellarmine much more plainely exact the condition of penance and of the sacraments to justification than

of faith as ezek

the wicked if hee repent of his sinnes shall live
luk

unlesse yee repent ye shall likewise perish
ioh

unlesse a man be borne of water and the holy ghost he shall not enter into the kingdome of god
answ
many things are required to salvation which are not required to justification which as they be necessary forerunners of glorification so are they the fruits of faith and consequents of justification viz repentance and newnesse of life which is the thing mentioned in these places
againe happinesse which consisteth partly in justification or remission of sinnes which is beatitudo viae and partly in eternall life which is beatitudo patri is oftentimes attributed to those things which are not the causes of happines but the notes and markes of them that be happy
there is but one happinesse properly and that is to be in christ who is eternall

life whom whosoever hath hath eternall life
of this happinesse christ alone is the foundation and the cause and faith the instrument of our union and communion with christ
all other virtues and graces are but the fruits and consequently the signes and markes of faith or of our being in christ by faith
and therefore are not so many beatitudes though they are blessed that have them but so many notes of one and the same happinesse
it is true that if we be sorry for our sinnes because by them we have displeased him who hath been so gracious a god unto us if we confesse them crave pardon for them and forsake them all which are duties of repentance the lord hath promised to forgive them
and

yet these are not causes of our justification before god but fruits of faith by which we come to be justified in our owne conscience
by faith we obtaine remission of sinnes and by these duties of repentance which are the fruits of justifying faith we attaine to the assurance of it
that prayer which somuch prevaileth with god is the prayer of faith

that repentance which is to life is caused by faith without which it is impossible to please god and therefore the disciples when they understood that the gentiles were brought to beleeve in christ conclude that god had given them repentance unto life act


as for the sacraments the justification which is assigned to them doth not hinder justification by faith onely but serveth to seale and to assure it


vi
the third cause or reason proving that faith doth justifie

alone is because it is the property of faith to apprehend and to apply the promise of justification to our selves
for the clearing whereof desire the reader to call to minde what hath beene said concerning the two degrees of justifying faith
for by the former wee apprehend receive and embrace christ who is our righteousnesse offered in the promises of the gospell to our justification before god
by the other wee apply the promises of the gospell to our selves that we may be justified in our owne consciences
both which actions of receiving and applying the promises to our elves cannot be ascribed to any other grace but are proper to faith onely

to this argument bellarmine shapeth two answeres the former

whereof is a meere cavill at the word apprehension which wee make proper to faith as if by apprehending we did meane the first act of the understanding when it conceiveth the object
but this point cleared before in the first question concerning the nature of faith where shewed that this apprehension whereof bellarmine speaketh goeth before all judgement of the minde
and that the understanding having first conceived and apprehended the object judgeth of it either by withholding the assent if it be doubtfull which is called doubting or by giving assent either weakely which is opinion or firmely which is knowledge this firme assent or knowledge is grounded either upon the evidence of the thing which is either manifest in it selfe and that is undefined span alphabet the cleare intelligence or manifested by discourse which is undefined span alphabet or science or else the thing being not evident either to sense or reason upon the infallible authority of god speaking in his word which is faith
by this beleefe we receive christ not onely in our judgements by assent but also if this assent be lively and effectuall we receive embrace and lay hold upon him as our saviour with all our soules acknowledging him in our judgements in our hearts desiring to bee made partakers of him in our wils resolving to professe him to bee our saviour and to obey him as our lord


vii
this is the apprehension whereof we speake and which is

peculiar to fai as it is evident
be it saith bellarmine that justification after a sort is apprehended by faith
surely it is not so apprehended that indeed it is had and doth inhere but onely that it is in the minde after the manner

of an object apprehended by an action of the understanding and will and so saith he love and joy apprehend

in these things bellarmine sheweth himselfe to be a diviner rather than a divine we doe not say that in our justification before god justification is apprehended by faith but the righteousnesse of christ unto justification
and that this righteousnesse of christ though not inherent in us is as truely and really made ours by imputation as our sinnes though not inherent in him were made his when he truely and really suffered for them
by this hand of faith we receive christ ioh

by it we receive and embrace the promises heb

by it we receive remission of sinnes act




by this mouth as it were

of the soule we eate the body of christ and drinke his bloud
that which hee speaketh of justification being in the minde after the manner of an object apprehended by an action of the understanding and the will may in some sort be verified of the apprehension of speciall faith applying justification to the beleever
but to say that after this manner love and joy apprehend it is against sense
for faith apprehendeth it by a perswasion yea by a firme perswasion upon which follow love and joy not apprehending but loving and rejoycing at that which faith doth apprehend
but these two are not incident unto a papist who renounceth speciall faith
for canst thou love christ and rejoyce in him as thy saviour if thou be not by speciall faith perswaded that thou shalt be saved by him seeing then unto our justification before god we are to receive christ as hath beene said by a true and lively assent and unto justification in the court of our owne conscience by a plerophory or assured perswasion we are to apply the promises to our selves which are the peculiar acts of faith and cannot be attributed to any other grace it followeth therefore from the proper nature of faith that by it alone we are justified


viii
his second cavill is taken from the sacraments which by

our confession as he saith doe apply the promises and justification it selfe to the receiver therefore saith he faith doth not justifie alone after the manner of an instrument applying
in this argument he greatly pleaseth himselfe but without cause
for first when we say that faith alone doth justifie we meane that in us nothing concurreth to the act of justification with faith but without us we acknowledge many things to justifie
secondly faith justifieth alone ut manus accipientis the sacraments ut manus dantis
thirdly faith doth actually justifie before god the sacraments doe not justifie before god but serve to seale our justification to our owne consciences neither doe they actually conferre grace but confirme it as the seales

of that righteousnesse which is by faith
when as therefore the termes of washing cleansing sanctifying saving are attributed to sacraments these phrases are to be understood sacramentally
and this is our answere as for those which bellarmine frameth for us hee hath good leave to make or to marre them at his pleasure

chap
xv bellarmines fourth principall argument taken from the manner how faith doth justifie and the fifth from the formall cause of justification


if faith saith hee doth justifie as a cause as the beginning

as the merit of justification then faith doth not justifie alone for love and penance and other good acts doe the like but the antecedent is true therefore the consequent
deny first the consequence of the proposition and the proofe thereof
for neither love or penance nor other good acts doe either cause begin or merit justification
and therefore though faith did justifie as a cause as the beginning as the merit whereby justification is obtained it might for all them justifie alone
this were sufficient to overthrow his whole dispute
but all his care is to prove the assumption which hee endeavoureth in all the parts thereof
and first that faith is a cause of justificatition which we doe not deny yea we affirme that nothing in us doth concurre to the act of justification as a cause thereof but faith onely
but you will aske what cause we say the instrumentall onely
if bellarmine meane any other cause as no doubt but he doth he should have done well to have named it and to have proved it


ii
he proveth faith to be a cause by the prepositions ex and per

by and through attributed to faith whereto answere that these particles sometimes are used to signifie the instrumentall cause
as namely when we are said to be justified or saved through or by the word or the sacraments rom

tit

ioh

cor



faith commeth by hearing rom

preachers are ministers by whom you doe beleeve cor

ephes


and first for those plàces wherein it is said that we are justified by faith or saved by faith rom




ephes


in these and the like places saith he the preposition by or through doth signifie a true cause
but he should have done well to have set downe what cause for an instrumentall cause is also a true cause
the preposition per saith

bllarmine in another place is not fitly accommodated to the favour of god which is the efficient cause of justification but either to the formal as per gratiam or meritorious as permeritum filii or instrumentall cause as per fidem sacramenta where you see by bellarmines confession per is attributed to faith as to the instrumentall cause
it is also attributed to the matter and merit as rom

when as therefore it is also attributed to faith it cannot be attributed in the same sense as to the death and obedience of christ in propriety of speech

but of necessity it is to bee understood by a metonymy faith being put for the object of faith which is christs righteousnesse
and this manifestly appeareth when justification by the preposition is attributed both to christ and to faith as rom


wee are justified undefined span alphabet by the redemption which is in christ undefined span alphabet by faith in his blood by christ we have accesse to god undefined span alphabet by faith in him eph

by the name of christ we have remission of sinnes by faith in his name act




as it is said of the cure of the creeple act


that the name of christ by faith in his name had healed him
thus have shewed before that the same benefits of justification and salvation which properly we receive from the death and obedience of christ are attributed to faith not properly but relatively and metonymically
not that faith it selfe worketh them but the object which it as the instrument apprehendeth


iii
but bellarmine will prove that in these and such like places

the prepositions by and through doe signifie a true cause first by the contrary
for when the apostle rom


gal


and elsewhere doth prove that a man is not justified by workes nor by the law without doubt he excludeth the force and efficacie of workes and of the law in justifying and not a relative apprehension alone
for no man could doubt but that the law and works did not justifie by apprehending righteousnes relatively
and therfore the saying of the apostle had been very foolish if his meaning had beene that justice is apprehended by faith and not by the law or workes
even as a man should speake foolishly who should say that the almes is received by the hand and not by the heele
neither did they whom the apostle confuteth looke to be justified by their workes relatively but by the merit of them
and therefore that which the apostle denyeth to works he ascribeth to faith
answ
this manifestly proveth that the question of justification by faith or by workes is thus to bee understood whether wee are justified by the righteousnesse of christ alone apprehended by faith which is the righteousnesse of the gospell the righteousnesse of faith or by a righteousnesse inherent in our selves which is the righteousnesse of the law or of workes
for if the question should bee understood of faith it selfe there would be no more opposition betweene faith and workes than is betweene the first and second justification of the papists which are so farre from opposition that they are the one proving the other
for if we be justified by righteousnesse inherent wee must bee justified both by habituall and actuall righteousnesse neither of them alone sufficing in adultis and therefore if by the one then by the other also

againe faith being but one grace among many cannot as it is an habit inherent in us by it owne worthinesse or merit justifie or sanctifie alone but there must be a concurrence of charity and of other graces neither can the habits of grace suffice to the sanctification of one come to yeares unlesse they bring forth the fruits of obedience neither are the fruits of obedience called good works of any account before god unlesse they proceed from the inward habits of faith and love
but faith

considered relatively as the instrument apprehending christs righteousnesse it self alone sufficeth to justification as the fathers before have testified
this is the worke

of god which with god is in stead of all workes that wee beleeve on his sonne
for hee that truely beleeveth is reputed as if he had fulfilled the whole law

christ being the end of the law for righteousnesse to every one that beleeveth rom


undefined span alphabet he therefore saith the apostle that beleeveth in christ fulfilleth the law because christ hath fulfilled it for him christs obedience being imputed to him and accepted of god in his behalfe as if hee had performed the same in his owne person


iv
secondly bellarmine by other places where the preposition is used indevoureth to prove that faith is deciphered as a true cause
for if saith he in all other places the preposition by or through doth signifie a cause why should it not betoken a cause when a man is said to be iustified by or through faith answer first that the preposition is often used to signifie no cause at all as where it is attributed to wayes and meanes occasions and times waies as undefined span alphabet mat

by another way undefined span alphabet mat

or set times as three dayes mat

secondly that the preposition is often used to signifie the instrumentall cause as in that hebrew phrase by the hand of his servants gen
as god commanded by the hand of moses exod

so by his prophets viz as his instruments

thus god wrought miracles by the hands of paul

or as himselfe speaketh undefined span alphabet by his ministery act


rom

undefined span alphabet by me

thirdly that faith is no such cause of justification as is usually meant by the preposition joyned either with other causes of justification or with faith upon other occasions
and first to mention those which bellarmine saith he will here omit as that we are justified by christ by his blood by his death by his obedience it may not be thought that

when it is said that wee are justified by or through christ and by or through faith or by or through the bloud the death the obedience of christ and by or through faith that faith though the same preposition be prefixed before it should signifie the same kind of cause
when the apostle saith rom

that we are justified by the grace of god there bellar noteth the formall cause of our justification confounding gods grace and our charity freely that is saith he by the bounty of god noting the efficient by the redemption wrought by christ iesus which noteth the meritorious cause by faith in his blood we must needs conceive that faith is a distinct cause from the rest
for neither is it the formall for there is but one and that one is charity as they teach nor the efficient undefined span alphabet for that is gods bounty and justice nor the undefined span alphabet or the meritorious cause for thath onely is the merit of christ
it remaineth then that it is the instrumentall which is plainely signified when it is said that we are justified through the redemption or satisfaction of ghrist by faith or when the preposition is attributed both to christ and to faith as noted before



bellarmine saith
that in that place rom

faith is there noted

to be the dispositive cause which have allready disproved
the truth is that for all this flourish which bellarmine here maketh hee maketh faith to be no cause at all of justification but a remote disposition which disposeth to justification no otherwise thn servile feare doth which is farre enough from being a cause of justification
if it bee said that he maketh it a part of the formall cause of justification answer that according to the councell of trent they constantly hold

that there is but one formall cause of justification and that is charity which being lost justification is lost though faith remaineth
the habit of faith infused indeed a chiefe part of our sanctification as a mother grace and root of the rest but of justification it is no part but an instrument
for justification consisteth wholly upon imputation of christs righteousnesse which faith as the hand doth receive


vi
for the better understanding the manner how faith doth

justifie wee are to distinguish the acts of faith both in justifying and sanctifying
the act of faith in justifying is the elicite and immediate act of faith which is credere credendo christum recipere amplecti to beleeve and by beleeving to receive and embrace christ
the acts of faith in sanctifying and producing morall dueties are immediate acts or imperati which faith produceth by meanes of other virtues commanded by faith such are sperare confidere amare timere obedire pati of justification the man indued with faith is not the efficient but the subject and the patient who receiving by faith which is his onely act the righteousnesse of christ is thereby justified god imputing to the beleever the righteousnesse of his sonne and therefore though to beleeve bee his owne act yet hee is not said in the active to justifie himselfe by faith but in the passive to bee justified by faith rom





but in the duties of sanctification and in all morall duties the faithfull

man is the efficient of them and his faith as it is said of arts other habits is the principium agendi the principle wherby he worketh and of them faith under god is the prime cause and as some call

that which is principium agendi undefined span alphabet such actions are the most of those which heb
are so highly commended which though they were the fruits of justifying faith yet were the acts of faith not as it justifieth but as it sanctifieth fortifieth or otherwise qualifieth them who are endued with it and this efficiencie of faith in greeke and latine is oftner signified without the prepositions than with as heb
though the sence be the same
of justification therefore faith is but the instrumentall cause justifying relatively that is in respect of the object which it doth receive being the onely instrument to receive that object which alone doth justifie
but of the dueties of sanctification and other morall actions such as for the most part are mentioned heb
whereof the faithfull man is the efficient justifying faith which purifieth the heart and worketh by love and other virtues as affiance is the prime cause working them not relatively by apprehending the object but effectually producing them as principium agendi wherby bellarmines dispute out of heb
is confuted
for there it is said saith hee that by faith the saints overcame kingdomes wrought righteousnesse obtained the promises stopped the mouths of lyons
where the particle by doth not signifie apprehension but the true cause
for faith was the cause of abels religious offering of noahs preparing the arke of abrahams obedience
all this confesse but that which he would inferre therupon that faith therefore doth not justifie relatively by way of apprehending the object have already answered for that which hee spake before of apprehending relatively was idle and frivolus


vii
the second part of his assumption was that saith is the beginning

of justice and consequently the inchoated formall cause of justification
so that now belike the seven dispositions shall be the inchoated formes of justification the entire forme being but one viz charity and consequently the disposing faith and the disposing feare and so of the rest shall be inchoated charity which is ridiculous
bellarmine in this argument as allwayes by justification understandeth sanctification whereof and of all inherent righteousnesse wee acknowledge faith to bee the beginning and consequently the beginning of that righteousnesse by which we are formally just
but of justification not the beginning only but the accomplishment and perfection is to be attributed unto faith because no sooner doe we by faith lay hold upon the righteousnesse of christ which is most perfect but wee are perfectly justified thereby
and therefore the fathers as you heard before acknowledge faith alone to suffice unto justification

if faith alone sufficeth unto justification then doth it not onely begin but also perfect and accomplish it
for rom

being justified by faith wee have

peace with god
but bellarmine endeavoureth to prove his assertion by authority of scriptures and testimonies of fathers
his first testimony

out of the scriptures is rom
to him that beleeveth in him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousnesse where saith he faith it selfe is counted righteousnesse and consequently faith doth not apprehend the righteousnesse of christ but faith in christ is it selfe justice
and if it be lively and perfected by charity it shall be perfect justice if not it shall at the least be unperfect and inchoated justice
answ
if the question were concerning the approbation or justification of the act of faith or the habit would acknowledge that the lord doth accept the same though unperfect in it selfe as righteous
as the zealous act of

phinehas was counted unto him for righteousnesse throughout all generations
but the apostle speaketh of the justification of the person who cannot by one habit and much lesse by one act of faith be formally just
but forasmuch as by faith in christ the beleever receiveth the perfect righteousnesse of christ this faith in respect of the object doth fully justifie the beleever and is therefore counted to him for righteousnesse not that it selfe is his righteousnesse nor that he is righteous in himselfe who still in himselfe remaineth a sinner but in christ
and such was the faith of abraham and of all the faithfull that not in themselves but in the promised seed all that beleeve in him should be blessed that is justified
the greeke word used sometimes by the septuagint as gen



and retained by the apostle gal


is very significant viz undefined span alphabet to signifie that not in themselves but in the promised seed they should be justified and blessed for so the apostle rom

useth these words promiscuously as also gal


the scripture foreseeing that god would justifie the heathen through faith preached before the gospell unto abraham saying in thee that is in thy seed shall all nations be blessed
this blessednesse therefore this justification is obtained by faith and therefore is faith counted righteousnesse because it receiveth it
as for faith it selfe absolutely considered without relation to its object we according to the popish doctrine are justified by it neither in the act of justification nor before
not before for untill it be as they speake formed with charity it cannot justifie nor in the act for charity alone is the formall cause of justification and then only are we formally justified when charity is infused or else there are more formall causes of justification than one which bellarmine according to the doctrine of the councill of trent doth utterly deny


viii
his second testimony corinthians


another

foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid which is christ iesus
by foundation saith hee augustine and other interpreters understand faith in christ
but paul himselfe say in expresse termes saith that this foundation is christ himselfe who most properly is called the foundation of his church
if therefore saith bee but the beginning and a part of justification because in bellarmines conceit it is called the foundation then christ himselfe the author and finisher of our faith and our perfect saviour who most properly

is the foundation

shall afford us but a beginning and a part of our justification
but be it that faith is called the foundation yet would rather thinke that it is called the foundation relatively because christ whom it apprehendeth is the foundation than that christ should bee called the foundation because faith is
sometimes faith is put for the object of it and so is hope and thus some understand gal


but that christ should bee put for faith suppose is not usuall
but whereof is it the foundation it is the foundation the beginning the root the fountaine of sanctification and of all inherent righteousnesse yet of justification it is not but christ onely who alone is the foundation of all our happinesse
augustine indeed by foundation understandeth

not onely christ himselfe but faith also working by love which as bellarmine said in the last argument is not as here he speaketh the beginning but the perfection of justice
chrysostome and theophylact whom hee quoteth speake not of faith but of christ onely
howbeit if faith must be held to be this foundation doubt not but that according to the scriptures

we are to understand the doctrine of faith concerning christ which often times is called faith which foundation the apostle laid when hee preached the gospell and whereupon other preachers are to build
this argument therefore was farre fetched and cannot be brought to conclude the point
the foundation is christ and not faith
or if faith then either the habit of faith working by love which is not the beginning or foundation of justification but of sanctification or the doctrine of faith of which the question is not understood


ix
his third testimony is act


purifying their hearts by faith

which plainely speaketh not of justification but of sanctification
for we having received christ by faith hee dwelleth in our hearts by faith and by his spirit applying unto us not onely the merit of christ his death and resurrection to our justification but also the virtue and efficacie of his death to mortifie sinne in us and of his resurrection to raise us to newnesse of life

the testimonies of the fathers serve all to prove that saith is the foundation and beginning of a godly life which because we doe freely confesse he might have forborne to prove



the third part of his assumption was that faith doth obtaine

remission of sinnes and after a sort merit justification and therefore justifieth not by receiving and apprehending the promise
answ
in the antecedent of this reason bellarmine contradicteth the councill of

trent which hath decreed nihil eorum quae justificationem precedunt sive fides sive opera ipsam justificationis gratiam promeretur
none of those things which goe before justification whether faith or workes doe merit the grace of justification
but here bellarmine ought to have proved three things which because he could not prove he taketh for granted
the first is that by other things besides faith we doe merit justification which notwithstanding god doth grant us gratis that is freely and without merit
for if faith did merit it which nothing else in us can

doe it would follow that faith doth justifie alon
the second that faith doth not obtaine remission of sinnes by receiving and apprehending the object which is christ
but the scriptures say plainely

that by beleeving in christ that is by receiving of him we receive remission of sinne
the third that impetrare est quodammodò mereri to impetrate is after a sort to merit for then what by faithfull prayer we begge of god we should be said to merit and in like manner the beggar should by begging merit his almes
but what saith bellarmine elsewhere

multum inteesse inter meritum impetrationem that there is great difference betweene merit and impetration and

thomas impetramus ea qu non meremur
meritum nititur justitia dei impetratio benignitate wee impetrate those things which we doe not merit
merit relieth upon gods justice impetration on his bounty
but let us examine his proofes


xi
the first out of luk

where our saviour telleth the

woman to whom he had said thy sinnes are forgiven thee that her faith had saved her for saith he it could not wel be said that her faith had saved her from her sinnes that is justified her if it conduced no more to justification than onely to receive the pardon
for who would say to a poore man who onely put forth his hand to receive the almes thine hand hath releeved thee or to a sicke man who received a medicine with his hand thy hand hath cured thee
answ
bellarmine before chap
alleaged this place to prove that the great love of this woman towards christ had procured the remission of sinnes which if it had beene true would have proved that not her faith but her love had saved her
secondly when our saviour saith thy faith namely in me hath saved thee his meaning is that himselfe being received by faith had saved her
as for the similitude of the hand say thus that if releefe by almes or cure by phycke were promised upon this condition onely that whosoever would but put forth his hand to receive the almes or the physicke should be releeved or cured it might truely be said that by the hand as the instrument elatively the party is releeved or cured
for such gracious promises hath god made to us that if we shall but put foorth the hand of faith to receive christ wee shall bee justified and saved from our sinnes
and such is the accompt that he maketh of this instrument by which onely we receive christ that for our comfort he may say unto any true beleever as hee did to the woman thy faith hath saved thee
for as when the people of israell

were bitten by the fiery serpents the lord having promised safely to all that should but lit up their eyes to behold the brasen serpent which moses had set on high to that purpose it might then have beene said of those that were saved that their eye had cured them so our saviour was lift up upon the crosse that whosoever doth but looke upon him with the eye of faith shall be saved
not that the hand absolutely doth releeve or cure but relatively in respect of the almes or of the medicine which it doth receive
nor that the eye of the body did cure those who were stung but the brasen serpent which was a figure of christ beheld with the eye nor the eye of the soule which is faith doth absolutely and by it selfe justifie or save

but relatively in respect of the object which it doth behold that is to say the lord iesus whom god hath propounded to be a saviour to all that see

him and receive him by faith


xii
his second proofe is from the speech of christ to the woman of canaan who had earnestly prayed unto him and would take no repulse matth


woman great is thy faith and mar

for this saying goe thy way the devill is gone out of thy daughter for here plainely saith he the efficacie of obtayning health is attributed to faith
neither may it be answered that it is one thing to speake of justification and another to speake of the cure of a bodily disease
for our lord in the very same words attributeth to faith both the one and the other
for as hee said to the woman which was a sinner luk

thy faith hath saved thee so in like manner to the woman whom hee cured of a bloudy issue
matth


and to the blind man whom hee restored to sight
mark


answer
though the woman of canaan and the blind man by prayer obtained their desires yet it was the prayer of faith as saint iames calleth it which was effectuall and prevailed with christ iam

and therefore to faith confesse the efficacie is to be ascribed
and although it may well be thought that our saviour when hee used the same words thy faith hath saved thee to the woman which had the issue of bloud and to the blind man which hee used to the sinner whose sins he had forgiven that he being the physitian of the soule used them in the same sence to assure them of a greater blessing than the bodily cure matth


yet doe not deny but that by faith and by the prayer of faith the health both of the body and soule is obtained for as by beleeving or apprehending by faith the righteousnesse of christ which hee had and performed for us wee are justified so by beleeving the divine power and goodnesse of christ many were cured of their bodily diseases
and yet as it was not their faith apprehending the power and goodnes of christ which did heale them but the power and goodnesse of christ which by faith they apprehended as it is said act


his name by faith in his name hath made this man strong so is it not our faith absolutely whereby wee apprehend the righteousnesse of christ which doth justifie us but the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith
and whereas bellarmine will have the like efficacie to be ascribed in justifying unto faith as in obtaining bodily health take him at his word for hereby it is evidently proved that faith alone doth justifie for our saviour for the obtaining of bodily health required faith onely
luk

mar

bee not affraid only beleeve and the like may bee gathered out of matth


mark

xiii
his third proofe is from the example of abraham rom



in the promise also of god he staggered not by distrust but was strengthened in faith giving glory to god most fully knowing

or being fully perswaded that whatsoever he promied he also is able to performe therefore it was also reputed to him for righteousnesse
here saith bellarmine the apostle rendreth te cause why faith was reputed to abraham for righteousnesse because by beleeving he gave glory to god

therefore that faith pleased god by which he was glorified and therefore by the mrit of that faith which notwithstanding was the gift and grace of god hee justified abraham
his reason may thus be framed

whatsoever pleaseth god meriteth justification
abrahams faith pleased god because he was glorified thereby
therefore abrahams faith merited justification

the proposition is to bee denyed for before men can please god they must bee reconciled unto him and justified by faith therefore our pleasing of god is not a cause but a fruit of our justification and it is evident that before that promise was either made to him by god or beleeved by him abraham was justified and therefore not by the merit of that beleefe
againe where men or their actions doe please god not in and for themselves but in and for christ in whom alone hee is well pleased there mercie is to bee ascribed unto god but not merit to them
yea but the apostle inferreth therefore it was reputed to him for righteousnesse
that argueth gods acceptation not his merit
howbeit that place may bee understood as that iam

that this was an evidence of the true faith of abraham which was imputed to him for righteousnesse not that abraham did then first beleeve or was then first justified and much lesse that he merited by that act of faith his justification which he had long before


xiv
his fourth proofe is out of rom
to which answered

before

the thing which here hee would but doth not prove though indeed it needs no proofe is that faith by invocation obtaineth justification
howbeit the apostle doth not there set downe the order of our justification but the series and order of the degrees of salvation beginning at our vocation unto which three degrees are referred viz hearing of the word which presupposeth preaching and that sending upon which followeth faith and justification thereby faith bringeth forth the dueties of anctification and namely invocation which sometimes and namely in that place of ioel

is put for the whole worship of god which is the forerunner of salvation but here is no snch thing ·either mentioned or meant that by invocation faith obtaineth justification and therefore little reason had he from thence to inferre that therfore faith doth not justifie relatively by receiving for sooth justification offered but by seeking knocking asing and finally by invocating and imperating it doth justifie
but passing by the weakenesse of his argument answere to that which hee inferreth that faith beggeth justification no otherwise but with relation to christ and his merits by it received
for as god forgiveth no sinnes for which christ hath not satisfied nor accepteth any man to life for whom christ hath not merited it so are not we to beg justification at the hands of god but in the name and mediation of christ beseeching god for christ his sake that forasmuch as christ hath satisfied the justice of god for the sinnes of all that beleeve in him and hath merited salvation and all spirituall blessings in heavenly things for them that it would therefore please god to accept of

christs satisfaction and merits in our behalfe imputing unto us both his sufferings for the remission of sinnes and his obedience for the acceptation unto life of us who receiving him by faith desire to be made partakers of his merits to our justification
for as in our mindes we receive christ by a lively assent or beleefe as hath beene shewed so in our hearts we receive him by an earnest desire expressed in our prayers to be made partakers of him and his merits
neither doth it follow that if by faith we imptrate or obtaine remission of sinnes that therefore faith is the meritorious cause of justification unlesse it bee understood relatively in respect of christ who is the onely meritorious cause both of our justification and salvation whom faith as the instrument doth apprehend


xv
his fifth and last reason is out of heb
where the apostle

by many examples teacheth that by faith men doe please god and consequently that faith is of great price and merit with god
answ
that faith doth please god and is of high account with god meane a true lively justifying faith not the faith of papists hypocrites and devils wee freely acknowledge to the honour of god the giver of it and to the shame of the papists who for all their saire pretences here doe much vilifie it
howbeit merit wee ascribe none to it unlesse it be relatively by apprehending christs merits to our justification and salvation
that abel henoch and others mentioned heb
did please god by faith doth not disprove our justification relatively but proves it
for god is pleased with none but in christ in whom he is well pleased
he is pleased with none in christ but with them only that by faith receive him


xvi
to these places of scripture bellarmine addeth tenne testimonies out of augustine nine whereof doe testifie that by faith

righteousnesse is impetrated that is by request obtayned and the righteousnesse which hee speaketh of is not the righteousnesse of justification but of sanctification
neither doe they prove any thing in this point but what wee confesse that by faith which purifieth the heart and worketh by love wee obtaine for that augustine meaneth by merits both the graces that is the habits and the fruits that is the acts of sanctification which we call good workes the testimonies are these

fides inchoat meritum ut per munus dei bene opertur where by merit he understandeth the grace of living well

that faith doth merit that is obtaine the grace of working well

lex adducit ad fidem fides impetrat spiritum largiorem diffundit spiritus charitatem charitas implet legem

quod factorum lex minando imperat hoc fidei lex credendo impetrat

per legem cognitio peccati per fidem impetratio gratiae contra peccatum per gratiam sanatio animae

violentia fidei spiritus sanctus impetratur per quem diffusa charitate in cordibus nostris lex non timore poenae sed justitiae a more completur

in nov testamento fides impetrat charitatem

ex fide ideo dicit apostolus justificari hominem non ex operibus quia ipsa prima datur ex qua impetrentur caetera quae proprie opera nuncupantur in quibus justè vivitur

fidès non potita conceditur ut ei potenti alia concedantur
his tenth testimony which in order is the second nec ipsa remissio peccatorum

sine aliquo merito est si fides hanc impetrat neither is the remission of sinnes it selfe without any merit if faith doe obtaine it
neither is there no merit of faith by which faith hee said

god bee mercifull to mee a sinner and worthily did that faithfull man being humbled goe home justified because hee that humbleth himselfe shall be exalted
where augustine abusively useth as other latine fathers often doe the word merit in the sence of obtaining and that by request and that appeareth by

bellarmines owne confession that augustine doth use to call merit any good worke in respect whereof we obtaine some other thing and by the place it selfe
in which sence hee saith the publican by his humble and faithfull prayer having obtained remission of sinnes went home justified
for if merit properly so called did goe before remission of siune then men should merit before they bee in state of grace which bellarmine denyeth then should wee not bee justified either gratis that is as all even bellarmine himselfe expound it sine meritis or by the grace that is the gracious and undeserved favour of god when wee deserved the contrary
againe beore remission of sinnes and justification all men bee sinners and unjust
now as augustine saith in the very next words going before quid habere boni meriti possunt peccatores what good merit can sinners have and a little before that meritis impii non grattam sed poena debetur to the merits of a wicked man not grace but punishment is due
finally the papists themselves ordinarily confesse that their first justification cannot be merited which is grace onely and not reward
though some of them sometimes doe talke of merits of congruity which properly are no merits or if they be pelagius his maine errour must take place gratiam secundum merita dari that grace is given according to merits
bellarmine here saith that hee hath proved

elsewhere that faith and contrition and other dispositions doe merit the grace of justification which the councill of

trent expressely denieth


xvii
his fifth principall argument to prove that faith alone

doth not justifie consisteth of two arguments drawne from two principles which he will but point at now but hereafter demonstrate
the one is from the formall cause of justification the other from the necessity of good workes unto salvation
for if the formall cause of our justification bee a righteonsness infused and really inherent in us and not the righteousnesse of christ apprehended by faith then faith alone doth not justifie but the former is true therefore the latter

the consequence of the proposition we grant for unto sanctification faith alone doth not suffice but there must be a concurrence not onely of other habituall graces thereunto but also of actuall obedience
but justification is not to be confounded with sanctification
neither doe we say that the righteousnesse of christ is the formall cause of justification but the matter by imputation whereof we are justified

the assumption namely that we are justified by a righteousnesse infused and really inherent in us he saith hee will fully prove in the next

booke

but all his proofes have already fully answered and confuted

in the third and fourth controversies concerning the matter and forme of justification and have by necessary arguments both disproved the negative to wit that wee are not justified by any righteousnesse inherent in us or infused into us and proved the affirmative viz that we are justified onely by the righteousnesse of christ imputed unto us
from whence have also demonstrated the truth of this assertion that we are justified by faith alone that is by the righteousnesse of christ alone apprehended onely by faith

a treatise of ivstification
the seventh booke concerning good workes
cahp

to avoid popish calumniations it is shewed that we doe hold the necessity of good works and doe urge the same by better arguments than the popish religion doth afford



as touching his last argument which he

bringeth to prove that faith doth not justifie alone drawne from the necessity of good works am now to treat
for this is the sixth capitall errour of the papists in the controversie of justification in that they stiffely hold that good workes are necessarily required unto justification as causes thereof and to salvation as the merit thereof
but before dispute the question am to meet with some calumniations of the papists
the first that wee by denying the necessity of good workes as being neither causes of justification nor merits of salvation doe disourage the people from wel doing and by teaching that by saith alone we are justified and saved doe animate and encourage them to the practise of all sinne and iniquity

answere that we doe not deny the necessity of good workes and that

use better arguments to deter the people from sin and to encourage them to well doing than the papists by their doctrine can doe
for to teach men to do good works with an opinion either of satisfaction propitiation or of merits which are the three chiefe arguments of the papists that they are satisfactory propitiatory and meritorious is to teach men to mar good works rather than to make them
because a good work undertaken with an opinion either of satisfaction or justification by them or of merit though otherwise it were good becomes abominable unto god as dergating from he alone and merit and satisfaction of christ
neither can they encourage men to well doing by these arguments that by their good workes they are justified and for them shall be saved whiles teir conscience must needs tell them that besides the guilt of their manifold sinnes their good workes are impure and that they can merit nothing at the hands of god but punishment these therefore who have just cause to doubt or rather to despaire of justification by their workes and of salvation by their merits cannot by these arguments receive true encouragement to well doing but rather discouragement there from
but although wee deny good workes to be either causes of justification or merits of salvation yet we affirme them to be not only undefined span alphabet good and

profitable but also undefined span alphabet necessary
the which will shew to prevent both the malitious slanders of the papists and also the prophane abuse of carnall gospellers who turne

the grace of god into wantonnesse
good say as being commended and commanded of god and therefore to be ensued phil


rom

psalm


profitable as being rewaded both beatitudine vice

with the blessednesse of this life and beatitudine patriae with the blessednesse

of the life to come tim




ii
necessary though not necessitate efficientiae as causes yet necessitate presentiae as necessary consequents of justification and as necessary

antecedents of glorification
they are necessary say by a necessity not onely privative if may so speake but also positive
privative because without them the profession of faith is not onely vaine and unprofitable but also hurtfull and pernicious vaine because such a aith is dead

and countereit justifying neither alone nor at all
hurtfull because being planted in the vineyard of god that wee might become trees

of righteousnesse if we bring not foorth good fruit wee must looke to be

cut downe or stocked

up or like the figtree which having greene leaves but no fruit

christ accursed
such professours are like the barren ground

which receiving the raine often falling upon it and bringig forth thornes and bryars is rejected and nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned
like to the foolish

virgins who having a lampe of an externall profession but wanting the oyle of saving grace when the bridegroome commeth are to be shut out
like the chaffe

in the floore which is to be winnowed from the wheat
like goates

in christs flocke which are to bee separated from the sheepe
like bondservants in gods house

which are not there to abide but with the bondwoman and her

sonne are to bee cast out who having a

formall profession of religion

but denying the power of it which is the faith of hypocrits must looke to have their portion with hypocrits

where is weeping and gnashing of teeth


iii
they are necessary also by a positive necessity and that manifold
as first by the necessity of infallibility in respect of gods

decree word oath

in respect of of his decree
for whom god hath predestinated to salvation hee hath predestinated unto

sanctification that they may be conformable to the

image of his sonne
and therefore whosoever doth hope

to become like unto christ in glory he must endeavour in some measure to resemble him in grace
we exhort therefore our hearers that they doe not abase the doctrine of predestination with those who were called predestinatiani as to thinke that either because they suppose they are elected they shall be saved howsoever they live or because they thinke that they are not elected they cannot be saved though they should live never so godly as if godlinesse if they be elect were needlesse or if not bootlesse
but forbearing to prye into gods secret counsels which are to be adored and not searched into to have recourse to gods word
for the

secret things belong unto the lord our god but the revealed things to us that wee may doe them
for there we shall finde these two things first that where god hath ordained the end hee hath also ordained the meanes
and therefore as it is necessary that the end should be accomplished because decreed by god so it is as necessary in respect of the same decree that the end should be atchieved by the same meanes which god hath preordained
now whom god hath elected them he calleth

whom he calleth according to his purpose them he justifieth by faith whom hee justifieth by faith them he sanctifieth by his spirit· whom hee calleth justifieth and sanctifieth them and no other he glorifieth
therefore as it is necessary in respect of gods decree that those who are elected shall be saved so it is as necessry in respect of the same decree that they should attaine to salvation by these degrees that is first they must be called and converted unto god they must bee justified by a true faith they must in some measure be sanctified by the holy spirit
the second thing is that in the word the lord revealeth his purpose concerning those that live well or ill
thou thinkest because thou hast a conceit that thou art elected thou canst not be damned though thou live never so wickedly
but be not deceived for god hath revealed his purpose concerning impenitent sinners who live and dye in sinne unrepented of

that there is no inheritance for them in the kingdome of god
as for example thou art a drunkard and wilt not be reclaimed from this sinne and yet presumest that thou shalt be saved because thou hast a conceit that thou art elected
but be not deceived no drunkards shall inherit the kingdome of god
on the other side thou hast a conceit that because thou art not elected thou canst not be saved though thou

shouldest live never so godly
but the scripture is plaine that whosoever truely beleeveth in christ whosoever unfainedly repenteth him of his sinnes whosoever walketh uprightly before god making conscience of his wayes hee shall bee saved
therefore whatsoever thy concit may bee concerning thine election or not election if thou doest truely beleeve in christ and repenting of thy sinnes doest endevour to lead a good life as sure as god is true thou shalt be saved


iv
secondly in respect of gods word which is infallibly true

now the word plainely testifieth that whosoever is in christ

is a new creature that those who are in christ

live not after the flesh but after the spirit that they who are christs doe crucifie

the flesh with he lusts thereof that christ was made unto us not onely righteousnesse

and redemption but also sanctification that christ came not with water alone

or bloud alone but with water and blood the bloud of redemption to cleanse us from the guilt of sinne and the water of ablution to purge us from the pollution of sinne that in whom christ dwelleth by faith

hee dwelleth in them by his spirit and that if any man have not the spirit

of christ he is none of his that faith being a fruit of the spirit and a grace of regeneration it cannot bee where the spirit of grace and regeneration is not and that unlesse men bee regenerate and borne

they cannot see the kingdome of god


thirdly in respect of gods oath in which it is impossible

that he should lye
now god hath sworne that whom he redeemeth from the hand of their spirituall enimies

he will give them to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of their life
for redemption is as well from the dominion of sinne as from the guilt of it
as for those who commit sinne

that is in whom sinne raigneth they are the servants of sinne and therefore not actually redeemed by christ for whom the sonne freeth

they are free indeed
those that are freed from sinne

become the servants of righteousnesse
those that are delivered from the hand that is the power of their spirituall enemies are ipso facto made the servants of god

whose service is true freedome
thus much of the necessity of infallibility


vi secondly they are necessary necessitate pracepti imposing a

necessity of duety towards

god
our neighbour
our selves

towards god that wee may bee not onely obedient

obsequious and well pleasing unto him but also which ought to be the chiefe respect of all our actions that wee may shew our selves thankefull unto

him who hath been so gracious unto us
first by loving him againe who hath lovedus first

for when the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts

by his spirit that is when by faith wrought in us by his spirit we are perswaded of gods infinite and unspeakable love towards us it cannot be but that our hearts should reflect some love towards him which is to be shewed in a willing observation

of his commandements
secondly in bringing forth those fruits which god expecteth and in atchieving

that end which god propoundeth to himselfe in all his benefits bestowed upon us
this is the will of god

even our sanctification that fruit

which he expecteth that end whch hee aimeth at in all his blessings
this is the end of our elction

secondly towards our neighbour first for avoiding of

offence cor
phil


making straight pathes

unto our feet that others treading in our steppes need not stumble or fall providing things honest

in the sight of all men labouring and endevouring to have a good concience void of offence

secondly that wee may edifie our neighbours by a godly example and provoke

them to good workes and winne them unto christ pet


thirdly that wee may stoppe

fourthly that wee may cause them also to glorifie god matth

secondly that wee may be made partakers of those blessings which are promised

viii
thirdly they are necessary necessitate signi as necessary

signes and evidences whereby wee are to gather assurance to our selves of our justification whereby our faith is

to bee demonstrated whereby wee are to make our calling and our election

sure
our election can not bee knowne priori by any foregoing thigs but posteriori and namely by the fruits of sanctification which are also the fruits of our election
for by a godly life our faith and justification is manifested ioh

respect wherof the faithfull are said to be justified by their workes iam

being justified

it is certaine that they are called according to his purpose and so called then elected are they elected then undoubtedly they shall bee saved
they are the cognizances of them

that are to bee saved for by faith wee receive the inheritance among them that are

sanctified
they are the evidences by which we shall be judged at the last day at which time god will judge men

according to their workes
for wee must all appeare before the judgement seat of christ that wee may receive according to those things which we have done in the body

whether it bee good or evill
those that have done good

shall goe into everlasting life and they that have done evill into everlasting punishment
for good workes though

wee are not justified by them nor saved for them yet they are the evidence according to which our saviour will pronounce the sentence of salvation matth


according to that psal

and to thee lord mercie for thou rewardest a man meaning the godly man according to his workes


ix lastly they are necessary necessitate medij and as that which

though it be no cause is called causa sine qua nn
and thus they are necessary first as the way which leadeth to life eternall via qua nos perducturus est ad finem itsum quem promisit

the way by which hee will bring us unto that end which he hath promised saith augustine
for those that are justified and by justification entituled to the kingdome of heaven they are to goe in the way of sanctification towards their glorification eh

good workes therefore though they bee not the cause of raigning yet they are the way to the kingdome
and so saith bellarmin himsele

that although god in predestination hath determined to give the kingdome of heaven to certaine men whom he loved without any prevision of workes notwithstanding hee did withall ordaine that in respect of the execution the way to come to his kingdome should be good workes
say then with the prophet esay

this is the way let us walke in it
secondly as necessary fruits of our election for wee are elected to that end that we should bee holy ephes


as necessary fruits of faith without which it is judged to bee dead am


as unseparable consequents of our redemption and justification luk

and as they are necessary consequents of our justification so they are necessary forerunners of salvation by which wee are fitted for gods kingdome because no uncleane thing can enter into the kingdome of heaven apoc

and finally so necessary is a godly life that without it no man shall see god
heb

conclude with bernard

that good workes are occulia predestinationis jndicia futur flicitatis presagia via regni non casaregnandi tokens of our secret predestination presages of our future happinesse the way to the kingdome but not the cause of our obtaining that kingdome
for howsoever good workes are necessary in many respects as have shewed necessitate presentiae yet they are not necessary necessitate efficientiae as causes of our justification


secondly the papists calumniate us as if wee taught that

good workes are not necessary to sanctification which slander as all the rest ariseth from their willfull and pernicious errour in consounding justifiction and sanctification
in the question of justification we hold according to the scriptures that if our owne workes or righteousnesse should bee obtruded unto the lord as the matter or merit thereof whereby wee should bee both acquitted from our sinnes and so delivered from hell and also entituled to the kingdome of heaven they are not onely to bee rejected but also detested as

menstruous clouts as dung

as losse
but in the question of sanctification where they are considered both as fruits of faith and the spirit as consequents of justification whereby wee testifie our thankefulnesse to god gather testimonies to our selves of our justification benefit and edifie our brethren

and also as necessary forerunners of glorification whereby we are fitted and prepared for gods kingdome unto which by justification wee are entituled and as the way wherein we are to walke towards our heavenly countrey and as the evidences according to which our saviour will judge us at the last day wee doe acknowledge they are highly to be esteemed of as those things wherein our sanctification doth in good part consist
for wee doe teach that our sanctification is partly habituall consisting in the habits of sanctifying graces faith hope charity humility the feare of god which is the first justification of the papists and partly actuall consisting in our new obedience or which is all one in good workes which is their second justification
this then is that which we doe hold that although good works doe not concurre with faith unto the act of justification as any cause thereof yet of necessity they must concurre in the subject that is the party justified as necessary fruits of faith as necessary consequents of justification as necessary antecedents of salvation
and this is that which not only we but bellarmine himselfe often citeth out of augustine bona opera accedunt justificato non praecedunt justificandum or thus bona opera non praecedunt justificandum sed sequantur justificatum good workes doe not goe before but follow after justification which is a pregnant proofe that they are no causes thereof

cap ii
that we are not justified by workes


having thus avoided the calumniations of the

papists wee are now to dispute the question which is to bee understood not of justification before men whereby we are declared or knowne to bee just but of our justification before god whereby hee maketh us just nor of workes as fruits and consequents but as of causes of justification
for we doe confesse that men are justified declarativè that is declared and knowne to be just to themselves or others by good works as the proper fruits of faith and undoubted consequents of justification but wee deny that we are justified before god by good works as any causes therof
and this our assertion we will first prove by necessary arguments and then defend the same against the objections of the papists


ii
and first prove it by all the arguments which used before to prove the five severall points already handled
for first if justification

is not to be confounded with sanctification as if it consisted in a righteousnesse inherent in our selves or performed by our selves then are we not justified before god by workes but the former hath beene clearely proved therefore the latter is to be confessed

if wee bee justified by the meere grace of god and that freely without respect of any workes done by us then are we not justified before god by works
for the holy ghost maketh such an opposition

betweene grace and workes that if we be justified by the one we cannot be justified by the other
but the antecedent hath beene formerly proved therefore the consequent cannot be denyed


if we be not justified before god by righteousnesse inherent in or performed by our selves but onely by the righteousnesse of christ through fith then are we not justified by workes
but the first have demonstrated by many undeniable arguments therefore the second must be granted


if we be justified by imputative righteousnesse that is to say by the righteousnesse of christ imputed to them that beleeve the lord imputing righteousnesse unto them

without workes then it is evident that wee are not justified by workes but that is most true as hath plentifully beene proved therefore this


if we be justified by faith alone then not by workes
but we are justified by faith alone as hath beene proved therefore not by workes
the arguments reduced to these five heads which were very many and impregnable might satisfie any reasonable man who is not wilfully addicted to his owne erroneous conceits though should adde no more but because wee have to deale with men unreasonable will adde some


iii
and first out of rom

he that worketh not is not

justified by workes he that beleeveth worketh not as the apostle there sheweth
and againe to whom faith is impured unto righteousnesse without workes they are not justified by workes to all the faithfull faith is imputed unto righteousnesse without workes therefore none of the faithfull are justified by workes
the assumption is thus proved if to abraham his faith was imputed for righteousnesse without works then are all the faithfull justified without workes for abraham is by the apostle propounded as a patterne therefore as he was justified so are we rom



but to abraham his faith was imputed for righteousnesse as the apo stle teacheth rom

therefore all the faithfull are justified without workes

the true doctrine of justification is taught in the scriptures justification by workes is not taught in the scriptures for the justification taught in the scriptures is an action of god justifying a sinner but this by workes is neither an action of god neither is it the justification of a sinner but the action of the justitiary himselfe who by the exercise and practise of good workes increaseth his inherent justice or fanctification which hath no affinity with that justification which is taught in the scriptures


none that are justified by faith are justified by workes all the faithfull are justified by faith therefore none of the faithfull are justified by workes
the proposition is evidently proved by that opposition which the apostle constantly maketh betweene faith and workes in the question of justification asfirming that men though abounding with works of grace are justified by faith without workes and saved by faith and not by workes rom



ephes


tit



if any be justified by workes then either the regenerate man or the unregenerate but neither the unregenerate as the papists confesse nor the regenerate for they are justified already
neither doe the scriptures acknowledge any sorts or degrees of justification before god


iv
all that are justified by workes are justified by that obedience

which they performe to the law but none are justified by the obedience which they performe to the law therefore none are justified by workes

the proposition is manifest
because the law being a perfect rule of all inherent righteousnes there neither are nor can be any good works which are not prescribed in the law
yea whatsoever worke is not conmable to the law is sinne
the assumpion may bee proved by many undeniable arguments
first by all those places which plainely testifie that by the workes of the law that is by obedience done to the law no man living shall be justified rom

gal


for by the workes of the law wee understand all duties prescibed and all that obedience which is required in the law

those that are accursed by the law are not justified by their obedience of it
for to bee justified is to bee blessed rom

and therefore to be justified and to be accursed are things repugnant

but all men whatsoever even those which seeke to bee justified by their obedience to the law are by the law accursed
therefore no man is justified by his obedience performed to the law
and this is the apostles argument gal


as have shewed before


all transgressours of the law are by the law accursed

all men since the fall are transgressours of the law christ onely excepted this assumption the apostle omitteth because hee taketh it for granted as being a truth received among the faithfull in those times though in these dayes denied by the justitiaries of rome but elsewhere it is by the apostle expressed as rom

all have sinned
wherefore as god hath concluded all under sinne rom

gal


so the law hath concluded them under the curse


all that are justified by their obedience to the law doe perfectly fulfill it by a totall perfect and perpetuall obedience for he that doth not so fulfill it by doing the things commanded though he did nothing that is forbidden by doing all though he did the most by continuing in doing all and in that measure and degree which the law requireth though he sinned but once in all his life and that either by omission or

comming short of his duety is a transgressour of the law and therefore subject to the curse of the law because hee hath not continued in all things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them
and he that offendeth in one is guilty of all iam


to whom the perfect fulfilling of the law is impossible by reason of the flesh they cannot be justified by their obedience performed to it
to all even the most regenerate the perfect fulfilling of the law is impossible by reason of the flesh rom

gal


as elsewhere prove at large
therefore none though regenerate can bee justified by their obedience performed to the law
sixthly that doctrine which is repugnant to the scriptures is false
the doctrine of justification by workes is repugnant to the scriptures
therefore it is false

the assumption is thus proved because the scriptures in all places where they treat of justification before god doe from the act of justification exclude workes
the places of scripture which we produce to this end bellarmine reciteth at least some of them with purpose

to answere them

rom

where is boasting then it is excluded
by what law

of workes no but by the law of faith

verse
therefore wee conclude that a man is justified by faith without the workes of the law to which hee might have added verse
therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified

rom

if abraham were justified by workes he hath whereof to glory but not before god
to which he might have added vers


to him that worketh not but beleeveth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousnesse even as david also describeth the blessednesse of the man unto whom god imputh righteousnesse without workes

gal

knowing that a man is not justified by the workes of the

law but by the faith of iesus christ to which adde the words following in the same verse for by the works of the law shall no flesh bee justified adde also chap
vers

as many as are of the works

of the law that is who seeke justification by the workes of the law are under the curse
for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them
but that no man is justfied by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith

ephes


by grace are yee saved through faith not by workes

lest any man should boast

account all things but losse and dung that may gaine christ and may be found in him not having mine owne righteousnesse which is of the law as all inherent righteousnesse is but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousnesse which is of god by faith

tit

not by workes of righteousnesse which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us


vi bellarmine before he maketh answere to these testimonies

noteth three things
first what the apostle meaneth by the law of workes and by the law of faith
secondly what difference there is betwixt the justice of the law and the justice in the law
thirdly what the apostle meaneth by workes when he saith a man is justified without workes
for the first he cavilleth with calvin and chemnitius and others as though they understood simply by the law of workes that which requireth workes and by the law of faith which requireth faith as if the law of faith did not also require workes and the law of workes did not also require faith whereas our writers distinguish the two covenants of god that is the law and the gospell whereof one is the covenant of workes the other the covenant of grace doe teach that the law of workes is that which to justification requireth works as the condition thereof the law of faith that which to justification requireth faith as the condition therof
the former saith doe this and thou shalt live rom

gal


mat

the latter beleeve in christ and thou shalt be saved iohn

act


but the papists whiles they teach that in the gospell perfect righteousnesse is required in us to justification and salvation as the condition thereof as much or rather more than in the law they doe either confound the law and the gospell making either of them to be the law of workes

or else as the apostle speaketh of the false teachers of the galathians they teach another gospell than that which christ and his apostles taught which whosoever doth though he were an angell from heaven he ought to be held accursed
but you will say is not obedience to the law required in the gospell answere it is not required unto justification and salvation as the condition but the ability of performing obedience is the grace of the new testament which is promised

to those that beleeve
and therefore our new obedience is required as the fruit of our redemption and as the way wherein wee being justified are to walke towards our glorification and as the cognizance of them that shall be saved


vii
bellarmine having rejected our exposition setteth downe

his owne the summe and effect whereof in plaine termes is thus
that the law of workes is the letter or the doctrine whether of the law or of the gospell prescribing what is to be done but affording no helpe to performe the same
and that the law of faith is the spirit or the grace of the new testament promised to those that beleeve whereby they are enabled to performe that which is commanded
which distinction betweene the letter and the spirit as it is propounded by saint

augustine is true but cannot bee applyed to this place rom

where by law on both parts is meant doctrine according to the proper signification of the hebrew word thorah
the law of workes signifying the morall law which unto justification requireth workes the law of faith signifying the gospell which to justification requireth

faith onely and is therefore called the

word of faith and the law of faith
for although bellarmine elsewhere

seemeth to make this to be a principall difference betweene the law and the gospell that the law is the letter commanding the gospell is the law of faith meaning thereby the grace of the new testament which is the law written in our hearts wherby we are enabled to performe obedience to the law yet hee confesseth that the gospell in the scriptures doth ever signifie the doctrine of the gospell and withall confesseth the doctrine of the gospell as it commandeth any thing to be a law of workes
so that lex fidei the law of faith according to this exposition is as well opposed to the gospell as it signifieth the doctrine thereof as to the law
but the difference betweene the law of workes which is the morall law and the law of faith which is the gospell in the question of justification whereof the apostle treateth is to bee fetched from that righteousnesse which either of them requireth to justification
for both of them require righteousnesse therunto
the law requireth the righteousnesse of workes the gospell in which without the law is revealed the righteousnesse of god by which we are justified teacheth the righteousnesse of faith undefined span alphabet

saith chrysostome upon this place undefined span alphabet what is the law of saith to be saved by grace
and this explication fitly agreeth to the scope of the apostle teaching that by the doctrine not of the law but of the gospell all boasting is excluded
as if the apostle had thus argued the true doctrine of justification excludeth all boasting
see ephes


but the law of workes that is that doctrine which teacheth justification by workes doth not exclude all boasting
see rom

which the law of faith doth teaching that wee are justified by remission of sinnes and saved by grace therfore that doctrine which teacheth justification by works is not the true doctrine but that which teacheth justification by faith without workes


viii
as touching the difference which hee putteth betweene

the justice of the law or that which is in it or by it
have spoken before

in the third question of this controversie where shewed that if it be admitted according to augustines meaning who was the author of it it maketh wholly against bellarmine
for though a man could performe justitiam legis considered in the abstract as it is described in the doctrine of the law and as bellarmine himselfe de justif lib
cap

doth consider it would justifie him because it is perfect yet considered in the concrete for that righteousnesse which men attaine unto in or by the law doth not justifie because it is unperfect
and therefore that righteousnesse which men have in or by the law doth not fulfill the righteousnes of the law which the apostle calleth undefined span alphabet
these two distinctions bellarmine hath devised to shift off onely two of the places cited viz rom

and phil


both which distinctions being rightly understood make against himselfe as have shewed


ix
now he commeth to the third thing viz what is meant by

workes
for saith he our adversaries by workes which the apostle excludeth

from justification understand all works whether done before or after faith yea faith it selfe considered as a work which opinion to be most absurd and proceeding from the ignorance of the scriptures augustine saith hee teacheth

men not understanding what the apostle saith we make account that a man is justified by faith without the workes of the law have thought that hee had said that faith is sufficient to a man though he live wickedly and have no good workes which be it farre from that vessell of election to thinke
and farre bee it also from us so to thinke
but although faith alone doth not suffice unto the perfection of a christian who is to bee saved yet it alone sufficeth unto justification wherein wee have had the consent of many of the fathers
and although to the act of justifying nothing in us concurreth with faith but it alone sufficeth yet in the party justified there must concur with faith both inward graces and also outward works
but here the papists are divided among themselves
some of them thinke that by the workes of the law are excluded not the workes of the morall but of the ceremoniall law others that the workes of the morall law are also excluded not all but such as goe before faith such as are done by the strength of nature without grace and without faith
answere first to both joyntly that not onely the workes of the law are expressely excluded but all workes whatsoever indefinitely rom



eph

and more specially the workes which wee have done in righteousnesse tit

the workes which god hath prepared for the regenerate that they should walke in them
ephes


againe in him that is said not to worke workes are not to bee distinguished but all are understood to be excluded but hee that is justified by faih is said not to worke rom

and to have righteousnesse imputed to him without workes verse
therefore his workes are not to bee distinguished but all are understood to be excluded



to the former severally answere first that when the holy

ghost nameth the law indefinitely he meaneth either the whole law which is called

mishmereth the observation of the lord or his charge containing three branches the morall the ceremoniall and the judicial law or the chiefe part which is the morall law
and that the apostle meaneth it especially because he speaketh of that law by which commeth the knowledge of sinne and which was common both to iewes and gentiles unto which the whole world was subject
rom

whatsoever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may bee stopped and all the world may become undefined span alphabet obnoxious to the judgement of god
therefore by the deedes of the law there shall no flesh that is neither iew nor gentile be justified in his sight for by the law commeth the knowledge of sinne

moreover it is evident that the apostle in that place speaketh of that law which forbiddeth morall offences mentioned

from the tenth verse to the ninteenth and by which all both iewes and gentiles are convicted to be under sin ver

secondly it is unreasonable to be thought that any man who was a transgressour of the morall law should looke to bee justified by the observation of the ceremoniall law which was

but a being but an appendice of the first table of the morall law as the judiciall was an appendice of the second table
and further the apostle professeth that whosoever would be circumcised was bound to the performance of the whole law
therefore the observer of the ceremoniall law could not be justified without the observation of the morall law
thirdly this answer which is given by some of the pontificians is rejected by bellarmine

and the greater part of learned papists who with us following the interpretation of augustine and other of the ancient fathers doe confesse that by the workes of the law which the apostle excludeth from justification are meant the

workes of the morall law as well as of the rest


xi
but then say all good workes whatsoever are excluded
for in the law which is the perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse all good workes are prescribed and therefore those which proceed from faith
for if charity which is the fulfilling of the law proceedeth from faith unfained tim



then doe those good workes which the law prescribeth proceed from faith also or else they are not such as the law requireth
and therefore frivolous is the distinction of bellarmine and other papists who by the workes of the law excluded from justification undertand workes done before or without faith by the strength of nature not workes proceeding from faith or workes of grace
the absurdity of whch distinction being applyed to the question in hand may further appeare


if workes going before justification bee excluded from being any cause thereof then much more those workes which follow justification for causes doe not use to follow after but to goe before their effects at least in order of nature

the question concerning justification by workes must of necessity be understood of good workes for of those which are not good no question ought to be made
but workes done before or without faith are not good
for whatsoever is not of faith is sinne and without faith it is impossible to please god
neither can the fruit be good whiles the tree is bad
neither can it be imagined that a man should bee justified by the workes of the law going before faith unlesse it bee presupposed that a man without faith and before grace is able to fulfill the law
for hee that doth not fulfill the law transgresseth it and hee that transgresseth it is cursed not justified by it

when the apostle termeth those workes which hee excludeth from the act of justification the workes of the law the word law is added not by way of extenuation as if hee spake of such as are not good or devised by men but of those good workes which god himselfe hath commanded and to the perfect performance whereof hee hath promised justification rom

and life gal


rom



the holy ghost speaketh generally of all men whether regenerate or unregenerate and of all workes whether going before faith or folloing it that a man that is every one who is justified is justified by faith without the workes of the law rom

that a man is not

justified that is that no man is justified by the workes of the law

but by the faith of iesus christ for by the workes of the law no flesh that is as the psalmist

speaketh no man living shall be justified
gal


for as in the first act of justification wee are justified by faith without respect of workes so our justification is continued unto us without respect of our workes
and this appeareth most plainely in the examples of abraham of iob of david of paul as shewed before

who though they abounded with good works which they wrought by faith

yet were not justified by them but by faith onely
for that which chrysostome saith of abraham is also verified of all the godly for saith hee that a man having not workes should bee justified by faith it is no unlikely thing

undefined span alphabet but this that a man flourishing in good workes should not thereby be justified but by faith it was wonderfull and very much setteth forth the force of faith


when the apostle excludeth workes from justification hee cannot bee understood to exclude them from the first justification only of the papists for that as themselves teach is meerely habituall consisting in the habits of grace
now it is a senselesse thing to imagine that the apostle would so seriously labour to prove that habituall iustice is not actuall or that good works are no part of habituall righteousnesse nor doe concurre to habituall justification


xii
notwithstanding bellarmine will prove that good workes only going before faith are excluded first out of rom

to him that worketh the reward is not reckoned of grace but of debt
nw saith hee such onely are those which are wrought by the strength of for to works done by grace that which is given is not simply merces wages but grace also yea grace rather than wages
answ
first the meaning of the apostle is this to him that fulfilleth the law whether it bee by strength of nature or by helpe of grace if any such were to him the reward of justification and salvation would bee due by gods covenant doe this and live
but to him that fulfilleth not the law which was the case of abraham and still is the case of the best but beleeveth in him that justifieth the ungodly such as he doth judge himselfe to be in himself he is justified gratis or of grace his faith being imputed unto him for righteousnesse without workes this place therefore proveth justification by faith without workes

secondly this assertion of bellarmine is confuted both by other papists and by himselfe also in other places
for first there is no rewards due to him that fulfilleth the condition of the covenant that is to him that fufilleth the whole law for he that doth not fulfill the law doth transgresse it and to him that transgresseth not reward but punishment is due
but to hold that a man before or without grace is able to fulfill the law is meere pelagianismes
againe all men before or without grace are wicked sinners and to such no reward is due but punishment
mritis impii saith augustine non grati sed poena debetur
secondly the papists and namely bellarmine himselfe teach that to

workes of grace proceeding from charity the wages of eternall life is as due as the promised hire to the workeman and that by workes of charity men doe merit and that condignely not onely ratione pacti by reason of the covenant sed etiam ipsius operis for the worth of the worke it selfe and yet forsooth the wages of their merit must be counted grace when the very place alleaged doth teach that the wages which is of debt is not of grace


xiii
secondly from the scope of the epistles to the romans and to the galatians which was to perswade men that without the faith of christ neither the iewes by the law nor the gentiles by their philosophie could bee justified or saved
which is untrue
for the apostle writeth not to unbeleeving either iewes or gentiles but to christians who were already perswaded of that truth
neither was there ever any beleeving iew who held that they might be justified by the works of the law without faith neither any beleeving gentiles who thought that by their morall works they might be saved without faith
that question therefore the apostle doth nowhere dispute
but whereas many of the beleeving iewes being zealous of the law and many of the beleeving gentiles being by the iewes were perswaded that they were to be justified not onely by faith in christ but also by the observation of the law that is to say by a righteousnesse inherent in themselves and to bee performed by themselves the apostle therefore sheweth that the righteousnesse whereby we are justified is the righteousnesse of god

and that neither iewes nor gentiles are justified by inherent righteousnesse wich is prescribed in the law to which end he proveth at large in the three first chapters of the epistle to the romanes that both iewes and gentiles were sinners and therefore were not to be justified by inherent righteousnesse which is the observation of the law but were to be justified freely by the grace of god through the redemption which is in christ by or through faith that is to say by the righteousnesse of christ both active and passive apprehended by faith
this righteousnesse of christ is that righteousnesse of god by which we are justified which is revealed in the

gospell as being the principall argument thereof rom

for so the apostle saith

that we are justified through the redemption that is in christ that wee are justified by his bloud rom

reconciled to god by his death vers
and constituted or made just by his obedience rom

of the scope of the epistle to the galatians am shortly to speake
but bellarmine in his whole disputation impudently perverteth the apostles scope as if the question which he disputeth were not this whether faith doe justifie without workes which every where he affirmatively concludeth but whether workes doe justifie without faith which the apostle never mentioned nor meant though bellarmine makes him to conclude it negatively viz that workes without faith doe not justifie
and to this scope hee maketh the whole discourse of the apostle to aime
by this sophisticall tricke bellarmine seeketh to avoid the force of the apostles arguments as if he concluded not against them we conclude that a man is justified

by faith without workes but thus wee conclude that a man is not justified by workes without faith neither the iewes by the workes of the law nor the gentiles by their morall workes without faith as if with faith they did justifie
and this he maketh to be the apostles meaning that workes done before or without faith doe not justifie but proceeding from faith they doe justifie and so is not ashamed to make the apostle to contradict himselfe
but the apostle doth constantly teach that a man is justified by faith without the workes of the law by faith and not by workes and maketh such an opposition betweene faith and works in the question of justification that if we bee justified by the one we are not justified by the other

for if by faith then of grace and if of grace then not by workes or if by workes then not of grace
it is therefore a most shamelesse and antichristian perverting of the apostles doctrine to make him teach that works proceeding from faith doe justifie and that we are justified both by faith and by workes when hee plainely teacheth the contrary

chap
iii
bellarmines answers to the forenamed places of scripture refuted



from these three things thus premised bellarmine

saith it will bee easy to answere all those places which were alleaged
and first to rom

he shapeth

an answere unto which have sufficiently replyed before saving that here hee addeth that not all glorying is excluded but only that which ariseth from such workes as are only done by the strength of mans owne freewill
and that hee proveth because the apostle saith ubi est gloriatio tua where is thy boasting that is that boasting whereby thou gloriest in thy selfe and not in the lord
whereunto reply that the word tua thine is not in the originall
and if it were yet that glorying whereby thou dost glory though it bee in the lord though in the grace and favour of god though in thy workes proceeding from grace is thy glorying
as the apostle saith this is our glorying even the testimony of our conscience cor

and cor

it were better for to dye than that any man should make my glorying void
cor

by our rejoycing which have in christ iesus our lord


ii
the second testimony recited by bellarmin was from the

example of abraham rom
for if abraham who was a most excellent precedent of faith and obedience and is propounded as a patterne

for the matter and forme of justification was not justified by his works which proceeded from his faith but notwithstanding that he abounded with workes of grace hee was justified by faith without workes then all the faithfull in like manner though abounding with workes of grace proceeding from faith are not justified by their workes of grace but are justified by faith without workes but the antecedent is evident by the testimony of the apostle therefore the consequent is a certaine truth

bellarmine answereth that abraham was justified by faith not by workes going before faith because they could not bee truely just unlesse it were in respect of externall righteousnesse and therefore if he had beene justified by them which he could not have beene unlesse they were truly just hee should have had glory but with men not with god
but when we reply that abraham at that time whereof the apostle speaketh that he was justified by faith and not by workes and that righteousnesse was imputed unto him without workes was a man regenerate excelling in the grace of faith and abounding in good workes which he wrought by faith and therefore when hee denieth him to bee justified by workes he plainely teacheth that the faithfull are not justified by workes proceeding from faith but although they abound with workes of grace proceeding from their faith yet they are justified by faith without workes
to this unanswerable argument taken from the example of abraham bellarmine frameth two answeres but such as men use to make when they are brought to a meere
first he saith that abraham indeed at that time whereof the apostle speaketh was regenerate and through faith wrought many good workes notwithstanding the apostle when hee saith that hee was justified by faith and not by workes doth not reject his workes wrought by faith but affirmeth that they were not wrought without faith because if they had beene such they would not have justified him
therefore he excludeth the workes which abraham might have wrought not by faith


iii
where bellarmine first taketh that for granted which the apostle

professedly disputeth against and concludeth the contrary namely that abraham was justified by workes
as if the meaning of the apostle when he argueth that abraham was justified by faith without works had beene this that he was justified by workes but yet such as were not without faith

secondly he inverteth the question and perverteth the disputation of the apostle for the mainetenance of his owne errour
as if the question were not whether faith doe justifie without workes which the apostle affirmatively concludeth but whether works doe justifie without faith which question the apostle doth not once mention which desire the readers to take notice of
for if the question which the apostle disputeth be not this whether works doe justifie without faith but this whethe faith doth justifie without workes then are the papists evidently confuted by the disputation of the apostle


he supposeth that faithfull abraham endued with abundant grace

might doe good workes without faith and without grace and that the apostle excludeth such workes not which abraham did but such as the might have done but did not
for it is certaine that the faithfull as when they sinne through infirmity doing that evill which they would not doe may say with the apostle rom

not but sinne that dwelleth in me so when they performe any good worke they may say with the same apostle cor

not but the grace of god which is with me


it is against sense to make the apostle dispute that abraham was not justified by such works as he might have done but did not but more senselesse when he maketh the apostle to dispute that abraham was not justified by his sinnes
for how doth he prove that they who have faith may worke sometimes without faith by two instances as namely first when they sinne
as if the apostle had said though abraham were a faithfull man yet some workes he might doe not of faith as namely when he sinned for sinnes are not of faith and by such workes hee was not justified
and the like is his second instance when they doe workes purely morall without relation to god for such if they be not of faith are sins
but these morall duties in the faithfull because they are not workes of the flesh must needs bee the fruits of the spirit gal



and although perhaps performed to men yet are done in obedience to god

neither doth the apostle distinguish betwixt abrahams workes as if hee were justified by some and not by others but in generall denieth him to have beene justified by any workes at all
and that hee proveth because his faith was imputed for righteousnesse
as if hee had said to whom faith is imputed for righteousnesse he is not justified by workes to abraham faith was imputed for righteousnesse therefore abraham was not justified by workes
the proposition is thus proved to him that worketh that is to him that fulfilleth the law righteousnesse is not imputed or reckoned of grace but of debt
but to him that worketh not that is that doth not fulfill the law but beleeveth on him that justifieth a sinner as all are and as hee acknowledgeth himselfe to be who therefore can merit nothing but punishment his faith is counted or imputed for righteousnesse

by this example of abraham bellarmine is notably confounded in two other respects


iv
for first whereas justification before god is but one wherein

the lord by imputation of christs righteousnesse to a beleeving sinner doth absolve him from his sinnes and also accepteth of him as righteous in christ not onely in the first moment of justification wherein being a sinner in himselfe he was first constituted righteous in christ but also in the continuance of justification wherein the beleever being still a sinner in himselfe is continued in the favour of god by the merits and intercession of christ and though a sinner in himselfe yet beleeving in him that justifieth a sinner is made the righteousnesse of god in christ
bellarmine notwithstanding maketh two justifications

the first wherein a sinner is made righteous by infusion of habituall righteousnes the second when a just man maketh himselfe more just by the practise of actuall righteousnesse that is to say of good works which two are degrees of sanctification and not of justification and saith that the apostle in the epistle to the romans speaketh only of the former wherein workes going before faith are excluded from the act of justification
so that in bellarmines conceit when the apostle saith that a man is justified by faith without workes his meaning is without workes going before justification
but what the apostle speaketh of other men hee affirmeth of faithfull abraham at what time he was a man regenerate as bellarmine consesseth and abounded with good workes which as the same apostle testifieth heb

he wrought by faith
and yet of him the apostle saith that he was justified by faith and not by works that the lord imputed unto him righteousnesse without workes that his justification or blessednesse consisted in the remission of his sinnes and imputation of righteousnesse and being a sinner in himselfe as all mortall men are hee was in christ the promised seed made blessed through faith
by the example of abraham therefore we learne first that that distinction of justification is forged
for abraham as when hee first beleeved was justified by faith without workes so afterwards when hee abounded with good workes hee was justified by faith and not by workes
and undoubtedly if ever any man attained to the second justification which the papists ascribe to workes abraham had it then when the apostle affirmeth that he was justified without workes
secondly that workes are excluded from justification not onely those which goe before faith but also those that follow and are wrought by it



the second respect when bellarmine endeavoureth to reconcile

the seeming difference betweene the apostle paul rom

and saint iames chap
hee saith that paul speaking of the first justification saith that a man is justified by faith without workes namely going before justification but saint iames speaking of the second justification saith that a man is justified by workes and not by faith onely

but both the apostle use the example of abraham for the proofe of their assertion paul proving that a man is justified before god by faith without workes demonstrateth his assertion by the example of abraham who though hee were most fruitfull of good workes yet he was justified by faith without workes
and as abraham was justified so are all the faithfull
saint iames concluding that a man is justified that is declared and knowne to be just by workes and not by profession of faith onely proveth also his assertion by the example of abraham who demonstrated his faith by his workes
by which though he were declared and knowne to be a just man as saint iames saith yet by them he was not justified before god but by faith only as saint paul teacheth
this example therefore of abraham doth prove that the apostle paul doth not speake of the first justification which is habituall nor of workes onely going before justification for abraham was a man long before regenerated

and justified and his workes were such as hee wrought by faith
but that this is a false and counterfeit distinction of justification it may further be proved
for if this be true that the apostle excluding workes from justification speaketh of the first justification which they say is meerely habituall then the apostle must bee thought to have taken all these paines to prove that to habituall righteousnesse good workes doe not concurre or that habituall righteousnesse is not actuall which needeth no proofe
and againe if onely workes going before grace be exculded from justification then the apostle must be thought to have boured seriously to prove that we are not justified by such workes as are not good which needeth no proofe for how should a man be justified by that which is not just this example therefore of abraham is as chrysostome speaketh undefined span alphabet abundant matter of much victory wherein we may truely and seriously triumph


vi bellarmine second answere is that the apostle speaketh with condition

if abraham was justified by workes not proceeding from the grace of faith as they thought who to their owne strength attributed righteousnesse then surely he had glory but not with god
and because it is evident enough that abraham had glory even with god thence hee gathereth that hee was not justified by workes without faith but by faith from which good workes truly proceed hee should have said by workes which proceed from faith if he meant to contradict us for we doe confesse that he was justified by faith from which good workes did proceed but withall we say that he was justified by his faith and not by his workes

but in this senselesse answere of bellarmine there are many absurdities for first by incredible impudencie hee taketh for granted that which the apostle disputeth against namely that abraham was justified by workes viz such workes as proceeded from faith secondly hee perverteth the question as if the apostle disputed that abraham was not justified by workes without faith or not proceeding from the grace of faith as they forsooth thought who to their owne strength attributed righteousnesse
as though either abraham had any good workes which did not proceed from grace or the apostle would busie himselfe to prove that he was not justified by such as he had not or as if the justitiaries among the iewes did attribute righteousnesse to their owne strength when the pharisee himselfe luk

gave thankes to god for it or as if they thought that abrahams righteousnesse proceeded from his naturall strength when they knew that god did chuse

abraham and by his preventing grace called him out of ur of the caldeans where

they served other gods
thirdly hee doth againe contradict the apostle in saying that abraham had glory with god which the apostle plainely denieth the word in the originall is undefined span alphabet which signifieth not glory but glorying or boasting
if abraham saith the apostle was justified by works then had he wherof to glory or to boast but he had no cause to glory or to boast before god
fourthly his contradicting of the apostle maketh against himselfe
for if abraham had beene justified by workes done without grace hee had more cause to

glory and that before god than if his workes proceeded from grace
for in that case it might have beene said to him what hast thou which thou hast not received and if

thou hast received it why dost thou glory or boast as if thou hadst not received it wheras therfore the apostle denyeth that abraham had whereof to glory before god he is to be understood as speaking of his workes proceeding from grace by which if abraham had beene justified he had whereof to glory but not before god
but being justified by faith without workes all matter of glorying was taken away
by what law of workes no but by the law of faith rom

for by grace we are justified and saved not by workes lest any man should boast ephes


and that this contradiction maketh against himselfe appeareth further by that which himselfe saith

in the same chapter out of rom

but unto him that worketh the reward is not imputed according to grace but according to debt
whence he proveth that by workes which the apostle excludeth from justification he meaneth such workes whereto not grace is given but wages rendred
and such are onely those saith hee which are wrought by the onely strength of
for to the workes which are wrought by grace that which is rendred is not simply merces wages but it is also grace yea grace rather than wages
if therefore abraham had beene justified by workes done by the power of his owne and not by grace hee might have gloried that he had made god a debtour unto him
but to abraham his faith was imputed unto righteousnesse and therefore his reward was of grace and not of debt
for to him that worketh that is fulfilleth the law of god the wages is not reckoned of grace but of debt as being due ratione pacti in respect of the covenant doe this and thou shalt live
but to him that worketh not that is that fulfilleth not the law which the apostle maketh to have beene abrahams case but beleeveth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousnesse rom



vii
and this also confuteth the doctrine of the papists concerning

the merit of good workes proceeding from grace unto which bellarmine here saith the reward is not rendred as of debt but onely to such as are wrought by strength of nature
but he and his fellowes when they treat of merit ascribe to works of grace merit of condignity
in respect whereof the reward of eternall life is due unto them in justice not onely in respect of gods promise or covenant but even in respect of the workes themselves
for every good worke proceeding from charity absolutely deserveth as they teach eternall life insomuch that heaven is no lesse due to the good workes of the faithfull than hell to the sinnes of the wicked


viii
as to the example of abraham so to these three places gal


ephes


tit

wherein all workes of all men are generally excluded from the act of justification bellarmine answereth that in them all those workes onely are excluded which are done before faith
but we will speake of them severally

and first to that gal


bellarmine saith that in that epistle there

are two questions handled the former speciall whether the ceremonies of the law doe belong to christians so that without them they cannot be saved
the other generall whether by the law and strength of nature justification can happen to any man without grace and without the faith of iesus christ
vnto both which the apostle answereth negatively
and afterwards he saith that the state of the question in that epistle is whether workes doe justifie without faith

whereunto reply that no such question is mentioned in that epistle nor the contrary concluded as being altogether heterogeneous and besides the purpose of the apostle which was to reclaime the galathians from their errour who thought that besides faith the workes of the law must concurre to justification
for both the false teachers

who seduced them were christians who lest they should suffer persecution for the crosse of christ perswaded them to bee circumcised gal


and the galathians themselves who were seduced did not cease to bee christians neither were they perswaded to renounce the faith of christ but were made to beleeve that unto their faith in christ they were necessarily to joyne the workes of the law that by them both they might be justified
against this assertion the apostle disputeth directly proving that a man is justified by faith and not by the workes of the law
but if he had disputed against the other that workes without faith in christ doe justifie or that workes done by the knowledge of the law only by the strength of nature doe justifie without faith in christ his disputation had beene to no purpose
for the galathians and their teachers would in their owne defence have answered that they did not from justification exclude faith in christ god forbid but did adde unto faith the observation of the law desiring as the papists now doe to bee justified not by faith alone but both by faith and workes together
and therefore as in the epistle to the romanes so here the question is not whether wee bee justified by workes without faith in christ which asserion never any christian held but whether by faith without workes which the galathians and their teachers would have with faith to concurre unto the act of justification
to which purpose call to minde the words in the very place alleadged
wee saith the apostle speaking of himselfe and saint peter knowing that a man is not justified by the workes of the law but onely

by the faith of iesus christ even we have beleeved in iesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the workes of the law
for by the workes of the law shall no flesh be justified
for if the faithfull such as peter and paul bee justified by faith and not by workes then are they justified without workes neither doe the workes of the faithfull concurre unto their justification


ix
but for all this bellarmine will prove that in the epistle to

the galathians the workes only done without faith are excluded from justification by certaine consequences which the apostle inferreth which saith he are most strong against workes done without faith but most weake against workes wrought by faith

page duplicate

page duplicate

that they are strong against the workes of nature doe confesse but that they be weake against justification by workes of grace they being equally strong against all doe deny
for the apostle when in the question of justification hee excludeth workes doth not distinguish of workes whether proceeding from nature or from grace as if by the one wee were justified and not by the other but generally excludeth all even those which are commanded in the law of god thereby meaning all inherent righteousnesse whatsoever even charity it selfe which is the

end of the law and proceedeth from faith unfained
for the law is a perfect rule of all inherent righteousnesse whencesoever it proceedeth
neither are the papists able to produce any one place of scripture wherein the apostle either affirmeth that wee are justified by workes proceeding from grace or propoundeth this question to bee disputed whether workes doe justifie without faith but even whether faith doth justifie without workes alwaies concluding the affirmative that wee are justified by faith without workes thereby teaching that workes doe justifie before god neither without faith nor yet with it



for the better understanding of this needfull point worthy

to be insisted upon and for the satisfying of bellarmines objections wherein hee pleaseth himselfe wee are to take notice that there are two wayes to life eternall which god hath propounded to man the one in the state of innocencie the other after his fall
the former was the covenant of workes or of inherent righteousnesse to be performed by himselfe the sacrament whereof was the tree of life
but when man had broken this covenant and was fallen from the state of integrity into the state of disobedience and corruption it being now not possible that he should be justified or saved by inherent righteousnesse according to the covenant of workes the lord therefore in his infinite mercie and love of mankind made with man being now a sinner the covenant of grace in the promised seed that whosoever truly beleeveth in him though in himselfe a sinner as since the fall all are should bee justified and saved by his righteousnesse
the faith in this covenant concerning the justification of sinners and salvation by christ was professed from the beginning after the promise was once made by all the patriarches and ancient beleevers who had testimony that they pleased god

and by faith in the messias wrought those things which were pleasing to god which without faith in christ they could not have done
and it was represented and figured in the sacrifices which were types and figures of christs sacrifice even from the

beginning
and the same was afterwards confirmed by sacraments viz circumcision which was ordained to bee a seale

of that righteousnesse which is by faith and the passeover which was a type of christ our passeover

who is immolated for us and prefigured by the propitiatory which covered the arke in which were the two tables of the law by the which did beare away the sinnes of the people by the high priest who was a type of christ in many respects but most plainely by

the brasen

serpent
but lest men should either through ignorance or pride neglect the benefit of the messias and consequently their owne salvation which is the common corruption of all naturall men it pleased the lord to renew the covenant of workes by publishing the morall law not with purpose that any should by the obedience thereof be justified or saved which bellarmine himselfe

confesseth but partly that to naturall and unregenerate men it should bee a schoolemaster unto christ discovering unto them their owne damnable estate in themselves both in respect of their sinnes and of the curse belonging unto them for the same that so they might be forced to seeke for salvation out of themselves in christ and partly that to men regenerated and justified it should bee a rule whereby to frame their lives and as it were a councellour and a guide to direct them in the way which god hath appointed them to walke in towards our country in heaven


xi
those therefore which looked to be justified by the observation

of the law as the galatians were taught by their false teachers were in a pernicious errour both because none can bee justified by the obedience of the law all men without exception being sinners and subject to the curse and also because there is such an opposition betweene these two covenants in the matter of justification that to bee justified according to the covenant of workes by inherent righteousnesse is a disanulling of the covenant of grace which cannot bee disanulled in it selfe though to him that seeketh to be justified by works it is made void as the apostle proveth gal

and therefore with him say

that if justification be by the works of the law whatsoever then the covenant of grace is disanulled and made void then is the promise made of none effect then christ died in vaine gal


then is the inherent no more of promise gal


but faith is made void and the promise made of none effect rom

then men are made debtours to the whole law and consequently christ is become of none effect to them
and finally they that seeke to be justified by the law are fallen from grace gal


according to all the consequences alleaged by bellarmine
from when argue thus

to them that are debtours to the whole law christ is become of none effect to them the covenant of grace is disanulled and the promise made of none effect
they that seeke to be justified by the workes of the law that is by righteousnesse inherent whatsoever whether before or after grace are debtours to the whole law

therefore to them that seeke to bee justified by righteousnesse inherent christ is become of none effect

the proposition is thus proved those that are debtors to the whole law are subject to a double yoake of most miserable bondage opposite to the liberty of justification the former in that they are to be subject to the fearefull curse of the law if at any time they transgresse it though in the least degree as wee doe very often and sometimes in an high degree the other to be excluded from justification if they doe not otally

perfectly and perpetually fulfill it which by reason of the flesh is utterly impossible to us
now christ came to free us from this double bondage of the law himselfe being made a curse for us and performing all righteousnesse in our behalfe that by the imputation of his sufferings and of his obedience wee might not onely bee freed from the curse but also bee entituled to the kingdome of heaven
and therefore to him that remaineth under this double yoake of bondage christ profiteth nothing
come to the assumption those that seeke to bee justified by the workes of the law that is by righteousnesse inherent are debtours to the whole law for neither are they free from the curse if they breake it as all doe
and therefore the apostle concludeth

them who are of workes that is who seeke justification by righteousnesse inherent are under the curse
neither can they be justified unlesse they perfectly keepe it
therefore they who seeke to be justified by the workes of the law that is by inherent righteousnesse whatsoever whether going before or following grace to them christ is become of none effect to them he dyed in vaine to them the covenant of grace is disanulled to them the promise is of none effect
so that whether you conceive of workes as going before or following grace the consequences of the apostle are one and the same


xii
indeed if the popish doctrine were true that christ hath

merited for us the infusion of that righteousnesse by which we are justied as hee hath done that by which wee are sanctified and that hee hath merited for our workes to make them meritorious of eternall life then those consequences would not be so strong against the workes of grace as of nature
but the scriptures teach us that christ doth justifie and save us by his blood and by his obedience that is by his owne personall righteousnesse and merits and not by any satisfaction of ours purchased by him nor by any merit of ours by him made meritorious
for if his satisfaction and merits for us be full and perfect what need we to patch to them the ragges of our owne satisfactions and merits but if that were the end why christ died for us that wee by his merits should obtaine both inherent justice whereby we should be justified and also merits of our owne whereby we should be saved as the papists teach then either that righteousnesse and those workes wich wee have by grace are sufficient to justifie and to save us or else christ died in vaine for us
but neither is that inherent righteousnesse which we have from christ sufficient to justifie us nor those good workes of grace which wee performe sufficient to merit eternall life as have in this treatise abundantly proved neither did christ dye in vaine for that to imagine were blasphemy
therfore that was not the end why christ our saviour died for us
say againe if christ dyed to this end that he might merit grace for us whereby we might in our owne persons satisfie the law and so be justified thereby then he merited not onely that we should perfectly and perpetually without any omission or intermission in all our life fulfill the law and be alwayes and altogether without sinne which by reason of our sinfulnesse is utterly impossible wee having beene sinners

from the wombe yea in the wombe but also that wee should in our owne person satisfie the penalty which cannot be done but by punishment eternall or that which is equivalent for where hath beene guilt of sinne as in all hath beene there the law cannot be satisfied without the punishment threatned in the law
and therefore if this were the end of christs death it must be confessed that he died in vaine but this consequent is blasphemous and therefore the antecedent is antichristian


xiii
to the fourth place which is ephesians

bellarmine

vouchsafeth no severall answere but sleights it over with that common answere that it excludeth onely workes done before faith

but this place ought not so to bee sleighted
for it doth ex professo teach that salvation and all the degrees thereof as namely justification are to bee ascribed wholly to the grace of god in christ through faith and not to any workes or deserts of ours whether going before or following justification
for first it may seeme needlesse that the apostle should tell the ephesians whom before in the same chapter hee had convicted to have beene before their conversion children of wrath as all are by nature dead in sinne bondslaves of satan living according to to the course of this world in all manner of sinne untill god in his abundant mercies in christ by whose grace they were saved quickned them together with christ that hee say should tell them that they were not justified by the workes which they had wrought before their conversion
secondly when the apostle saith you are saved by grace and not by workes will they say hee excludeth onely workes going before salvation why then hee excludeth all
and that distinction with which bellarmine contenteth himfelfe as a sufficient answere cannot be fitted to this place
if it be said that the apostle by salvation meaneth justification
confesse that among the degrees of salvation hee doth specially meane justification whereby we receive the right to our inheritance

and are intitled to the kingdome of heaven and saved in hope
but from hence it is inevitably proved that by what wee are justified we are saved and by what we are saved we are justified
but we are saved as the apostle here saith by the free grace of god through faith not of any workes of ours whatsoever or whensoever performed therefore in the like manner we are justified
what then will you say if we bee neither justified by good workes nor saved for them are they therefore to bee neglected answere in the third place that good workes though they be excluded from the act of justification or merit of salvation yet they are not excluded from the conversation of the faithfull but are therein required as necessary fruits of our regeneration and consequents of our justification as also being the way wherein wee are to walke towards our glorification
as the apostle sheweth in the next words vers
for wee are saith he gods wokemanship created in christ iesus unto good workes which god hath preordained not that wee should bee justified by them or saved for them but that wee should walke in them as the way to eternall life where we are to observe

that those words being a prevention of a secret objection viz if wee be not justified by good workes nor saved for them are they therefore to be neglected no saith the apostle they that are justified are the workemanship of god created unto good workes which god hath prepared that we being justified and regenerated should walke in them
and therefore the apostle speaketh manifestly not of workes going before grace but of such good workes as are consequents of our justification and fruits of our regeneration wherein we being regenerated and justified are to walke as in the way to our glorification


xiv
the next place viz tit

which is like to the former bellarmine shifteth off with the like common answere that it speaketh of workes going before faith
but hee may not carry it so
for the apostle having as hee had done eph
signified that all of us before our conversion lived in all manner of sinne but after that the kindnesse and love of god our saviour to man appeared not by the workes of righteousnesse which wee have done but according to his mercie hee saved us
where as in the former place he useth the phrase of saving unto which as said bellarmines distinction cannot bee fitted
and secondly the workes which he excludeth hee doth expressely call the works of righteousnesse which terme cannot agree to the works of such men as the apostle describeth vers
and such are all men unregenerate


xv
the sixth and last testimony whereunto bellarmine answereth

is phil


where the apostle in the question of justification renouncing his owne inherent righteousnesse which not onely hee had in his pharisaisme but which then hee had according to the law desireth to bee found in christ having that righteousnesse which is through the faith of christ
bellarmine answereth according to his distinction formerly used that by the righteousnesse which is of the law are meant workes done through the knowledge of the law by the onely strength of nature which have before confuted
neither would paul make any question of his justification by his works done before his conversion
for before his conversion notwithstanding his pharisaicall proession of righteousnesse hee doth confesse that he was a blasphemer and injurious and of all sinners the chiefe tim


and whereas chemnitius objecteth that paul rejecteth not onely his workes before his conversion which he sinifieth speaking in the time past ver
but what things were gaine unto me counted losse for christ but also the workes of his present condition which hee noteth speaking in the present tence and using particles of amplification undefined span alphabet yea doubtlesse and doe count all things but losse
as if he should have said nay more than that even now doe count all things as doe count all but as dung bellarmine answereth that as the apostle in the beginning of his conversion had counted them losse so hee did still
but if the apostle had spoken of the same workes whereof he spake ver
the amplification used vers
would have been but an idle repetition and the exposition which we give was long since delivered by

chrysostome
the apostle saith hee having said these things undefined span alphabet counted losse for

christ he saith undefined span alphabet yea that which is more doe count all things losse undefined span alphabet he said all both past long since and also present


xvi
but here bellarmine thinketh he hath chemnitius at a great advantage as if hee had spoken blasphemy for saying that the apostle calleth his workes done after his calling which were the fruits of the spirit and for which he expected a reward tim


even a crowne of righteousnesse undefined span alphabet dung
whereunto reply in the question of sanctification wee doe highly esteeme of good workes but in the question of justification if they shall be obtruded as the matter by which wee stand just before god by which we are both freed from hell and entituled to heaven if affiance or trust be put in them for our justification before god then seeme they never so glorious they are to bee esteemed as things of no worth yea as losse
and in the like cause as hath beene shewed the godly

have compared their most righteous works to menstuous clouts
and in this sense chemnitius

speaketh that the apostle quod attinet ad articulum justificationis did thus speake of his workes done after his renovation
immo saith he si fiduc justitiae cor am deo ad vitam aeternam illis operibus assuaur pronunciat ille esse stercora detrimenta but if the word undefined span alphabet translated by the vulgar latine stercora offend bellarmine hee may translate it quisquilias as hierome

doth meaning thereby things of no value such things as use to be cast to dogges or· swine according to the notation of the word
for as suidas saith undefined span alphabet or as others undefined span alphabet

that which is cast to swine
and from hence is the verbe undefined span alphabet which signifieth

to bee rejected as a thing of no worth
chrysostome and theophylact upon the place by undefined span alphabet understand undefined span alphabet chaffe
photius undefined span alphabet straw or stubble
but heychius expoundeth it by undefined span alphabet dung
conclude as bellarmine doth against chemnitius eat nunc bellarminus queratur
let him complaine that wee are enemies to good workes because in the question of justification when men trust to them to bee justified before god by them and so make idols of them which the holy ghost calleth deos stercoreos

wee esteeme them not onely as things of no alew but also as losse


xvii
to these testimonies added others out of the same

chapters or epistles no lesse pregnant than these unto which more might bee adjoyned as rom

being justified freely by his grace which text affordeth two arguments from the words gratis and gratia from the former argue thus

those that are justified freely gratis are justified without workes
all the faithfull are justified gratis freely
therefore all the faithfull are justified without workes

the assumption is proved out of the text
the proposition because the word gratis is so expounded by all sors of writers both old and new both protestants and papists gratis id est sie ueribus sine meritis as have shewed heretofore

gratis saith quia nihil perantes

nec vicem reddentes sola fide justificati sunt dne dei by which words hee excludeth all workes as well following after as going before
oecumenius undefined span alphabet thou art saved freely without any good workes of thine which words exclude all merits as well from salvation as from justification
and so doe those words of the apostle ephes


tit

to avoid this evident truth

bellarmine coyneth a twofold distinction
first that the word gratis may bee understood as opposed to merits of condignity going before justification and so it excludeth not the dispositions and preparations which the papists teach goe before justification which according to their doctrine are but merits of congruity
but it is evident that not onely merits of condignity but all merit whatsoever yea and all respect of our owne worthinesse and well doing is excluded so that gratis is as much as without any cause in us or any desert of ours or worthines in our selves
and thus the councill of trent

it selfe expoundeth this word
we are therefore said to be justified gratis freely because none of those things which goe before justification whether faith for workes deserve the grace of justification for if it be grace then is it not of workes for it were of workes then grace were not grace as the same apostle saith secondly saith he it may bee understood as opposed to our owne merits or good workes done without grace for those that proceed from grace are not opposed to grace and therfore not excluded

whereunto reply we cannot have any good thing but by gift from god and what good thing we have from god that is called ours as our faith our charity our hope our good orkes neither can wee without grace merit any thing but punishment
it is therefore absurd to understand the apostle as excluding merits without grace when as if we should doe all that is commanded which cannot be done without grace we must confesse that we deserve not so much as thanks because we have done but what was our duty to doe
neither can wee bee said to be justified gratis if there be any meritorius cause of justification in our selves though received from god in regard of our selves indeed wee are justified gratis but it is not gratis in nor without paying a great price in respect of christ
and therefore to those words justified freely by his grace is added through the redemption whih is in or by christ
by the word gratis therefore the apostle signifieth tha in us there is no materiall cause no merit of justification but onely in christ
and where he saith that grace cannot bee opposed to grace say it may as in that opposition which is of relatives as of the cause and the effect
for the effect cannot be the cause of its owne cause and therfore works which are the fruits and effects of justification cannot bee the causes thereof

the other argument is from the word grace
for if our justification be of grace then not of workes as the apostle teacheth rom

and if of workes then not of grace
so ephes


you are saved by grace not of workes
for to him that worketh the reward that is justification or salvation is not imputed of grace but it is rendred as of debt but

to him that worketh not but onely beleeveth in him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is imputed namely of grace to righteousnesse rom

even as david also describeth the blessednesse of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousnesse without workes verse

chap
iv
bellarmines arguments proving the necessity of good workes and first from the difference betweene the law and the gospell secondly from the doctrine of christian liberty




now come to bellarmines arguments concerning

good works which when he should prove they concurre to justification as causes thereof hee proveth them to be consequents thereof rather than causes
and having little to say to the question it selfe he intermingleth many impertinent discourses
impertinent say to the question though not to his purpose which was to calumniate us as though we held all those assertions which he laboureth to confute

in his fourth booke therefore which is de justitia operum he propoundeth two maine questions to be disputed unto which divers others are coincident
the former concerning the necessity of good workes the other concerning the truth of them
as if we either denied that good workes are necessary or that they are truely good
to the former hee referreth three questions the first whether the faithfull are bound to keepe the law of god as though wee taught they were not the second concerning the difference betweene the law and the gospell as if we taught that the difference standeth in this that by the law good workes are necessary by the gospell not
the third concerning christian liberty as though we taught that the faithfull in their conscience and before god are subject to no law

concerning the truth of the righeousnesse of good works after hee hath disputed the question whether the law be possible whether the workes of the righteous bee sinnes he commeth at length to handle the controversie it selfe whether good workes doe justifie or not
concerning the former questions it shall suffice to shew what our tenet is in every of them and to defend our assertions against his cavils farre as concerneth this present controversie of justification by workes passing by the rest as impertinent
as touching therefore the first principall question which concerneth the necessity of good works

the reader will beare me witnes by that which before have delivered that we hold good workes necessary in many respects and that we urge the necessity of them by better arguments than the romish doctrine doth afford we confesse that they are necessary necessitate presentiae for persons come to yeeres that are already justified and are to bee saved as necessary consequents of justification and as necessary forerunners of salvation onely we deny them to be necessary necessitate efficientiae as causes either of justification or salvation


ii
that good workes are necessary to salvation which we deny

not bellarmine greatly busied himselfe to prove but that they are necessary to justification as causes thereof which is the question betweene us for ought that can discerne he goes not about to prove in his whole discourse of the necessity of good workes wherein he spendeth nine chapters
for after he had in the first chapter calumniated us as if wee denied good workes to bee necessary to salvation in the chapters following hee proveth they bee necessary because as hee propoundeth his proofes in the argument of his booke we are bound to keepe the law of god
and that he proveth by discussing the other two questions concerning the difference betwixt the law and the gospell and concerning christian liberty
but by these arguments bellarmine neither proveth his owne assertion nor disproveth ours
his assertion is that good workes doe concurre unto justification as a cause thereof which we deny
he argueth they be causes why because they are necessary
as if every thing that is necessary were a cause
but whereto are they necessary to salvation saith bellarmine
why but the question is of justification
now many things are required to salvation which doe not concurre to justification as namely

confession

holinesse of life

patience

perseverance which though they goe before salvation yet they follow after justification and therefore cannot be causes thereof
in all this discourse therefore bellarmine is farre from concluding the point in question

notwithstanding it will not be unprofitable if shall make a short excursion to follow him in his discourse but not to answere every particular which is not worth the answering
that therefore he may confute our most pernicious errour as he calleth it

he saith he will prove three things first that in the gospell is contained the doctrine of workes and divers lawes and that the promises thereof require the condition of fulfilling the law secondly that the just are not free from the observation of the law of god thirdly that good workes are simply necessary to salvation


iii
his intent in the first is to disprove that difference which

we make betweene the law and the gospell from whence he had collected in the former chapter that we deny the necessity of good works
the difference was this that the law propoundeth justification and salvation upon the condition of our fulfilling the whole law
but the gospell promiseth justification and salvation upon the condition of faith only excluding works as the causes by which we are justified or for which we be saved which difference if it be true as it is most true

plainely proveth justification by faith only and disproveth justification by workes

for the better understanding whereof wee are to distinguish the

this doctrine teacheth us that our gracious god out of his meere grace having elected his children in christ before all times did in the fulnesse of time send downe his sonne to save us and that the benefit of the messias might be applyed unto us vouchsafeth unto us the gospell of grace by which according to the purpose of his grace given unto us in christ before all secular times

he calleth us working in us the grace of faith being endued with faith hee imputeth unto us the righteousnesse and merits of christ making us partakers of redemption reconciliation justification and adoption and so freeing us from hell and from all the enemies of our salvation hee entituleth us unto the kingdome of heaven
and that wee may be fitted and prepared for his kingdome into which no unholy thing may enter apoc

hee hath promised to them that beleeve that being redeemed reconciled justified adopted and so entituled to the kingdome of heaven hee will give them grace to worship him without feare in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our life that is in the voluntary upright and constant obedience of his law
luk


it is true that the things which god in this covenant of grace hath promised to give as namely faith and new obedience are also required of us deo dante quod jubet god giving to us what he requireth of us the one as the antecedent condition whereby we are entitled or have right to his kingdome being saved in hope the other as the consequent and fruit

of the former whereby we being entitled to gods kingdome are prepared and fitted for it without which though none who are adulti are saved heb

yet none are saved by it or for it it being the way to the kingdome but not the cause of it nor the title that we have unto it and therefore necessary as have said necessitate presentiae as causa sine qua non but not necessitate efficientiae as any true or proper cause thereof


these things thus premised it will be easy to answere bellarmines

arguments taken from the difference betweene the law and the gospell to prove the necessity of good workes
and they are two the former disproving the supposed false difference the other proving the pretended true
as touching the former having first propounded an idle distinction of the divers acceptions of the word gospell that it signifieth either the doctrine which christ and his apostles taught or the grace of the new testament which is the quickning spirit or the efficacie of the holy ghost working in the hearts of the elect or the law written in the heart which therefore call idle because as soone as he hath propounded it he confesseth that the word gospell in the scripture

doth never signifie any other but the doctrine hee proveth that in the gospell is contained the doctrine of good workes and divers lawe divers comminations and divers promises made upon condition of good workes

all which we doe confesse to be true as the word gospell is taken in the larger sense
but as those promises and doctrine of grace contained in the bookes of the old testament did not belong to the law properly which is the covenant of works but to the gospell which is the covenant of grace so in the books of the new testament divers precepts comminations and promises are contained which belong not properly to the gospell which is the covenant of grace and law of faith but to the law of works
for even as the preachers of the gospell at this day doe in their preaching intermingle many things appertaining to the law either for the preparing of their auditours who are not yet justified by the terrour of the law or for directing those that doe beleeve to lead their life according to the rule of the law even so our saviour christ and his apostles in their doctrine intermixed legall precepts legall promises and threatnings as the necessity of their auditours required
but upon all this being granted what will he inferre he saith in the title of this chapter though in the chapter it selfe he doth not expresse it that from hence is proved the necessity of good works which we deny not
so pertinent a disputer is this great master of controversies


vi
and forasmuch as the promise of eternall life as of a reward

made to our obedience is the principall ground whereon the papists build their antichristian doctrine of the efficiencie and merit of good workes will endeavour to cleare this point
we are therefore to understand that eternall life is vouchsafed to the faithfull in three respects
first as the free gift of god without respect of any worthinesse in us
secondly as our inheritance purchased by christ
thirdly as a free reward promised and given to our obedience
in the first respect our salvation and all the degrees thereof is wholy to be ascribed to the gracious

favor of god in christ
in the second to the mercy of god and merit of christ
in the third to the mercies of god redoubled and multiplied upon us and not to any desert of ours
for as touching the first god before the foundation of the world was laid of his free grace elected us in christ

graciously accepting of us in his beloved without respect of any goodnesse in us whom when he foresaw fallen into the state of perdition ex massa perdita humani generis did chuse us in christ in him and by him to be justified and saved
and as out of his undeserved love he did chuse us so by the same grace whom he hath elected

he hath called whom hee hath called he hath justified whom hee hath justified hee hath sanctified and whom hee hath called justified and sanctified he hath glorified according to the purpose of his grace

given unto us in christ before the world began
as therfore all the degrees of salvation are wholly to be ascribed to the grace that is the gracious favour of god in christ for by his grace we were elected called justified regenerated and sanctified so also by his grace wee are saved

and not of works
for although eternall death be the wages deserved by sin

yet eternall life is undefined span alphabet the free gift of god through iesus christ our lord no way deserved by us
rom

this his purpose of grace god revealed by his gracious promise to our first parents and ater to abraham and others viz that in the promised seed

all the nations of the earth should be blessed


vii
now that this his purpose of grace might be put in execution

and this his gracious promise concerning he promised eed might be performed to the illustration of the glory both of his mercie and also of his justice god in the fulnesse of time out of his infinite goodnesse and love to mankind sent his owne and his only begotten sonne into the world that hee taking our nature upon him might not onely in the state of humiliation by his sufferings redeeme us from hell and by his meritorious obedience purchase heaven for us but also that in the state of exaltation he having conquered all the enemies of our salvation in and before his resurrection might by his ascension take possession for us of that kingdome which he had by his merits procured for us and by his sitting at the right hand of his father might make us to sit together

with him in heavenly places and by his comming from thence againe might put us both in body and soule in possession that heavenly inheritance which he had purchased for us
and to the end that the benefit of our blessed redeemer and saviour might be applyed and communicated unto us the ord according to the purpose of his grace

givn unto us in christ before all secular times doth in his good time call those whom hee hath elected by minitery of the gospell mae effectuall by the gracious operation of his hly spirit working the grace of faith in us whereby wee receiving christ with all his merits are actually made partakers of redemption and are actually reconciled unto god justified and adopted and by our justification entituled to the kingdome of heaven and by our adoption made heires thereof and coheires with christ insomuch that being justified by faith wee have thereby not onely remission of sinnes

but also the inheritance or at least the right and title to it in respect whereof it is said in the scriptures of so many as truely beleeve that wee are saved ephes


that we are passed from death to life and that we now have eternall life ioh



ioh

and in this respect eternall life is our inheritance which christ hath purchased or us
and according to this tenure christ will put us in possession thereof at the last day when hee shall say unto us come yee blessed of my father undefined span alphabet]· inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world matth


for you say who before the beginning of the world were in christ elected to be heires of this kingdome which is not to he attained unto by any purchase or merits of ours but shall bee given us as an inheritance intended from the beginning and prepared for the elect for whom christ by his merits hath purchased it


viii
now to those who by gods speciall grace doe beleeve

in christ and by faith receive him by whom so received they are justified and adopted and by their justification and adoption are in such ort

entituled to this kingdome as heires apparent thereof that they are allready said to bee saved and to be set in heavenly places with christ to these say that they might be fitted and prepared for this inheritance unto which no uncleane

thing can come he hath in the covenant of grace freely and out of his undeserved mercie promised the grace of sanctification by his holy spirit whereby wee are enabled according to the measure of grace received

to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him

and to the end that we might be moved to performe the dueties of sanctification hee doth not onely in his word seconded and made effectuall by his spirit invite by exhortations and precepts to these dueties but also that hee might encourage us thereunto in his redoubled and multiplied mercies he hath promised not only the blessings of this life unto us but also eternall life it selfe as a gracious reward of our piety and obedience
here therefore in admiration of gods bounty towards us we have just cause to exclaime with augustine

the great goodnesse of god to whom when in respect of our condition we ought to render unto him the duties of obedience as servants to our lord and god as subjects to the almighty as captives saved to our redeemer he doth promise unto us the rewards of friendship that hee might draw from us the dueties of service which wee doe owe unto him
it was of gods free grace that hee elected any of us that being elected hee called us that being called and endued with faith hee justifieth and adoptet us and thereby giveth us right to his kingdome it was also of his free grace that to them whom hee redeemeth and justifieth hee hath promised to bestow his graces upon them whereby they are enabled to serve him in holinesse and righteousnesse and are fitted for his owne kingdome
but this is a multiplication of his grace upon us that to encourage us to the practice of piety whereby wee are fitted for the kingdome of heaven he doth promise to reward our good works with everlasting happinesse and in the end doth crowne his owne blessings with blessednesse which though hee bee pleased for our encouragement to call a reward yet is it not deserved by us but freely bestowed by him as his free gift granted unto us in christ before all times as our inheritance purchased by christ as his bountifull reward of his owne gifts which as hee freely promiseth so in his good time hee freely bestoweth as his undefined span alphabet that is free gift


ix
to this purpose let us consider the lords dealing with

abraham to whom the lord at his first comming towards the land of promise made divers gracious promises which afterwards hee often repeated
but when upon that commandement of tryall to offer up his onely sonne abraham had by gods speciall grace notably approved

his faith and obedience hereupon the lord doth sweare that he will bestow upon him the things which before hee had promised as the reward of that his obedience for so hee saith because thou hast done this thing and againe because thou hst obeyed my voice
can any man hereupon inferre that abraham by his obedience had deserved these

promises which god long before had made unto him and oftentimes repeated nothing lesse so god in his eternall counsell hath to the elect designed eternall life as his free gift by christ christ by his merits hath purchased it to bee our inheritance god hath graciously promised to bestow freely this inheritance on them that beleeve in christ when as therefore god doth promise to reward our piety with eternall life wee may not thinke that by our piety it is deserved which god long before had decreed and promised and christ our saviour had purchased for us
but though it bee a reward yet it is a most free and undeserved reward



when the papists therefore object that if eternall life be the

reward of our obedience then our obedience doth deserve it answere first thou canst deserve nothing at gods hand by that which he hath freely given and much lesse that which hee freely bestoweth on thee secondly if thou shouldest doe all that is required of thee thou couldest deserve nothing thereby for where is debt and duty there is no

merit luk

thirdly we doe not all that is commanded but come short of our duty and that which we doe is unperfect and defective in respect of manner and measure and therefore in justice deserveth punishment rather than reward and consequently the reward when it is given is to bee ascribed to gods undeserved

mercie and not to our merit
fourthly sanctification and the duties thereof are not causes of salvation and therefore in serie causarum in the chaine of the causes of salvation rom

they are left out and where they are mentioned they are inserted not as a cause of salvation but either as the way unto it ephes


or as the markes and cognizances of them that shall be saved or as the evidences according to which god will judge
as marks say for they are occulta praedestinationis indicia futurae faelicitatis praesagia as

bernard speaketh
our saviour setting downe the end of the ministery of the gospell saith that a man being thereby called may by faith obtaine remission of sinnes and inheritance among them that are sanctified act


so also act




xi
and thus are wee to expound many testimonies of scripture

as speaking of notes which the papists expound as speaking of causes
thus rom

the spirit it selfe beareth witnesse with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children heires of god and coheires with christ who shall be glorified with christ if hee hath given us grace not onely to beleeve

but also to suffer with him and for him he doth not say that our suffering doth make us sonnes and heires of god who shall be glorified with him but the spirit beareth witnesse that if we suffer with him we are the sonnes and heires of god who shall be glorified with him
so tim


if we suffer wee shall reigne with him if we patiently suffer it is not a cause but a signe that we shall reigne with him rom

there is no condemnation to them that are in christ iesus
but how shall we know who they are that shall be saved by christ that walke not after the flesh but after the spirit where walking after the spirit is not the cause of salvation but a signe

of their being in christ which is the cause
christ is the foundation and cause of all our happinesse and faith is the only instrument whereby wee receiving christ are united unto him all other graces and duties unto which happinesse any where is ascribed as it is to many matth


psalm


are but notes of our being in christ by faith and presages of our future happinesse
thus in the same chapter rom

if by the spirit yee doe mortifie the deeds of the body that is of the flesh as the vulgar latine rendreth it and as paul speaketh cor

ye shall live
so rom

whosoever calleth upon the name of the lord shall be saved that is whosoever hath this grace given him unto him truly to worship god it is an evident signe and assurance unto him that he shall be saved and so of the like ambrose

this is the signe of justification in a man that by that which dwelleth in him he that is justified may appeare to be the sonne of god


xii
as evidences according to which the lord will judge

for so it is often said that god will judge men acccording to their workes
thus matth


come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world for when was hungry you gave me meat this rationall particle for though it be called causall and the sentence where it is used is called undefined span alphabet the rendring of the cause doth not imply a cause properly so called but any argument or reason as have shewed heretofore as here it implyeth an argument from the fruits as signes and evidences of their bleessednesse in christ by faith
the causes of this sentence of salvation are set downe vers
first because they are blessed of god that is justified
secondly because elected for whom god in his eternall purpose hath provided this kingdome
thirdly in that it is called the inheritance purchased for them that truely beleeve in christ who as soone as they beleeve are by justification blessed as being entitled or having right to this heavenly inheritance and this is implyed in the verbe undefined span alphabet inherit shewing that they come to that kingdome by right of inheritance
salvation therefore is given as a fre gift of god depending upon election and justification and as an inheritance purchased by christ for all true beleevers and therefore not merited by them that are saved
but because god hath promised salvation to all that have true faith in christ which is a secret and inward grace and many men deceive themselves with a vaine opinion and profession of it therefore the lord will judge of men according to the fruits thereof when as men therefore professing the true faith doe demoutrate their faith by good workes and namely by the workes of charity and mercie they give good proofe of their election whereby this kingdome was prepared for them and of their redemption by which christ purchased this inheritance for them and of their justification whereby they are entituled to this kingdome and so are blessed of god
and therefore according to these fruits christ pronounceth the sentence of salvation


xiii
wherefore to proceed in my answeres to the afore said

objection for by that which hath beene said it appeareth
fifthly that eternall life is not deserved by our obedience because it is the free gift of god depending upon gods free election
sixthly because we come to it as to an inheritance purchased by christs merits and not by ours
seventhly though it be a reward yet it presupposeth no merit of ours because it is a free and undeserved reward whereby the lord out of his meere bounty doth crowne his owne gifts
ea enim est dei bonitas saith learned casaubon

ut beneficia gratuitò in suos collata ali beneficiis coronet atque hoc mercedem appellet such is the goodnesse of god that such benefits as he hath freely bestowed upon his children he crowneth with other benefits and this hee calleth reward nihil tamen saith calvin

quasi debitum solvens sed mercedis titulum imponens suis beneficiis not as rendring any debt but imposing the name of reward on his owne benefits


xiv
now let us examine the testimonies which bellar alleageth

wherein upon condition of obedience eternall life is promised
the first is matth


unlesse your righteousnesse exceed the righteousnes of the scribes and pharisees ye shall not enter into the kingdome of heaven which words containe directly a threatning and not a promise for hee doth not say if your righteousnesse doe exceed the righteousnesse of the scribes and pharisees which was but externall and in outward shew yee shall enter into the kingdome of heaven but if it doe not which argueth that internall righteousnesse is necessary to salvation necessitate as causa sine qua non but doth not prove it to be so necessitate efficientiae
and so doe other threatnings heb

luk

matth


cor

gal




xv
the second testimony is mat

if thou wilt enter into

life keepe the commandements
where a rich man being a justitiray as many of the iewes

were quia

omnis spes saltis apud iudaeos in

operibus erat non in fide taking it for granted that by his workes he must bee saved but not satisfied as justitiaries never are but ever remaine doubtfull and uncertaine of their justification as wee see in the papists say not satisfied with all that obedience which he had performed from his

youth up but finding that something still was lacking hee commeth to our saviour to know what good

works those were by doing whereof he might bee saved
good master saith hee what good thing shall doe that may inherit eternall life
to him our saviour fitteth his answere and first to confute his errour and to let him understand that no man living who is but a meere man can be justified by inherent righteousnesse he telleth him that no man is good that is purely and perfectly just and therefore reproveth him for that hee thinking our saviour to bee but a meere man as others were did call him good
but in the second place to answere his question hee telleth him that if by his owne workes hee did hope to bee saved hee must doe those workes which god himselfe had commanded and so referreth him to the comandements of the law of which god himselfe had said doe this and thou shall live which is the legall promise levit


rom


gal


thus our saviour fiteth according to the law his answere to the disposition of the party who was a justitiary
but oterwise when our saviour and his apostles were a ked the like qestion they made answere according to he doctrine of the gopell
for our aviour being asked ioh

what shall wee doe that we may doe the workes of god answered vers
this is the worke of god that which he esteemeth in stead of all workes that ye beleee in him whom hee hath sent for he that beleeveth hath fulfilled the law christ being the nd of the law to every one that beleeveth rom

and the apostle paul being demanded of the iaylour what must doe to bee saved answereth beleeve on the lord iesus christ and thou shalt bee saved act




xvi
in the third place he alleageth testimonies out of the doctrine

of the apostles viz rom

tim


iam

pet


ioh

apoc
answ
the place cited out of iames is no promise but a commendation if you fulfill the royall law ye doe well
of rom
and tim


spake before

but concerning them and all others that are or may be alleaged there is a distinction of conditions to be held that either they import the cause of the thing promised which is salation or happinesse or the proper markes and cognizances of such as shall be saved or are happy which doe not shew propter quid sunt vel servandi· sed quals beats sunt quales servandi
christ our alone saviour is the onely cause of salvation and the onely foundation of our happinesse he is eternall life

and whosoever hath him hath life eternall
faith is the only instrument whereby we receive christ and therfore to it also is salvation ascribed in respect of the object which it doth receive as when it is said thy faith hath saved thee it is to be understood as if it were said christ received by faith hath saved thee
a condition therfore of receiving christ by faith or of christ received by faith betokeneth

the cause but all other coditions either of graces or of works doe not signifie the cause of salvation but the proper markes and cognizances of those which shall be saved
and therfore prove that the markes ae or may be necessary by the necessity of presnce but not by necessity of efficiencie


xvii
and this also may seve to answere his fouth and fifth arguments

his fourth is fetched from the doctrine of the prophets
ezek
if the wicked shall turne from all his sins that he hath committed and shall keepe all my statutes and doe that which is lawfull and right he shall surely live
that is if he shall turne from the wrong way into the right and goe on therein as sinne is an aberration and the errour

of his way hee shall come to the end of his way which is salvation
so that this condition is not the cause but the way
yea but saith bellarmine in the same place to turne from righteousnesse and to breake the commandements of god is a condition upon which dependeth the commination of death for if a righteous man turne from his righteousnesse and commit iniquity he shall surely die
therefore as the turning from righteousnesse unto sinne is the cause of death the turning from sinne to righteousnesse is the

cause of life
answere that there is not par ratio
there is no equality be tweene the sinne of the wicked and the righteousnesse of the godly
death is the due

wages of sinne and sinne is the meritorious cause of death
but eternall life is the free gift of god and not merited by our righteousnesse
sinne is of infinite demerit and so deserveth death eternall
but not the obedience of any man but onely of christ if it did merit at all or can be of infinite merit to deserve eternall life
the sinnes of he wicked are purely and perfectly evill but the righteousnesse of the reenerate is not purely and perfectly good
the sinnes of the wicked are their owne workes wholly proceeding from themselves and to themselves the wages thereof is wholly and properly to be ascribed and imputed the good workes of the regenerate proceed from gods free grace and therefore when they are rewarded god crowneth his owne graces in them and not their merits

that which he babbleth concerning promises absolute and conditionall as if we held all the promises of the gospell to bee absolute is a shamlesse and senselesse cavill
wee are so farre from saying that they be all asolute as if indifferently and without condition they promised salvation to all that we rather say they are all conditionall
but we di+stinguish of conditions that some are from the cause as where the condition of faith is interposed and such conditions wee doe hold to bee necessary necessitate efficientiae some from other arguments and such are necessary onely necessitate presentiae


xviii
his fifth argument is taken from the condition of

faith which we doe not deny to bee contained in the evangelicall promise
now saith he by what words the scripture requireth the condition of faith by the same or more cleare it teacheth the condition of fulfilling the law to be required
answ
the condition of fulfilling the law is required no where but in legall promises and is a condition by reason of the flesh impossible
but in all these promises which hee citeth excepting that matth


not the condition of fulfilling the whole law is required but of some speciall duties betweene which and the condition of faith is great odds
for faith relatively understood that is christ received by faith saveth alone it alone entituleth us and giveth us right to salvation
aske of any particular duty to which salvation is promised will invoction rom
will suffering rom
will any other duty or grace save a man or entitle him to salvation no one part of righteousnesse though it may be a proper marke of them that shall be saved can save a man
but faith that is christ received by faith saveth alone
thus much may suffice to have answered his former argument in defence of that difference which wee make according to the scriptures betweene the law and the gospell in respect of justification


xix
his other argument to prove the necessity of good works

which wee deny not is taken from his true pretended differences betwixt the law and the gospell whereof he setteth downe two principall and six secondary differences arising from the principall
all of

them impertinent to the matter in hand excepting the first and also

the last which serveth to confute the first is that such is the difference betweene the law and the gospell as betweene a doctrine begunne and perfected for as in respect of the mysteryes to believed and the promises to be hoped for the gospell excelleth the law should have said the new testament excelleth the old for of the the two testaments that is of the law and the gospell largely and not strictly taken this difference is to be understood so also in respect of the precepts which are to be done
for to omit the ceremoniall and judiciall lawes which hee impertinently mentioneth hee saith that the law and the gospell have in a maner the same morall precepts but with this difference that in the gospell some more heavy or weighty things are imposed upon christians tha were in the law exacted of the iewes as in the matter of polygamy and billes of divorce which not withstanding by the morall law were as much forbidbed to them as now to us secondly that christ did perfect the moral law prescribing a more perfect righteousnesse than the law required
thirdly that to the precepts hee hath added counselles tending to perfection answ
this difference is suitable to the rest of their wicked and antichristian doctrine which in this whole treatise confute wherby as they confound justification and sanctification so also the law and the gospell saving that in the gospell they say greater perfection is required of inherent righteousnes to justification than the law prefcribeth and so make it a law of workes as much or rather more than the law it selfe


xx
this is confuted by the eigth or last difference wherin

hee truely saith that the law of mose was most heavy and unportable but the gospell of christ is an easie yoake

and a light burden
if petor therefore exclaimed against those which sought to impose the law of moses upon christians act


what shall wee thinke of our popish rabbins that impose an heavier yoake than the law it selfe
for whereas bellarmine saith the gospell is the easier because of the grace of the newe testament accompanying it yet the difference is to be understood in respect of the doctrine it selfe and the letter which if it reqire more perfect obedience is in it self the heavier burden

ii
this difference by confounding the law and the gospell doth make void the covenant of grace which god made with abraham and performed in christ which was concerning iustification by faith which as it could not be disannulled

by the covenant of works so much lesse was it repealed but renewed and ratified in the gospell
but if in the gospell were taught justification by works and not by christs righteousnesse apperhended by faith the covenant of grace made with abraham should in the gospell be repealed rather than renewed
for the covenant of works promiseth justification and life upon condition of perfect and perpetuall obedience the covenant of grace upon condition of faith
and these two in the article of justification are undefined span alphabet incompatible
if therfore the gospell doe teach justification by workes it maketh void the covenant of grace and thus the popish gospel overthroweth the gospel of christ

thirdly this difference overthroweth a maine benefit which we have by christ and without which we can neither be justified nor saved which is this that he hath freed us from the rigour of the law which standeth in an exaction of perfect righteousnesse to be inherent in us and perfect obedience to be performed by us unto the acceptation either of our persons or actions which by reason of our corruption is impossible unto us
and therfore miserable is their estcate who are in bondage to the law either subjecting them to the curse if they offend in the least degree when in many things wee offend all or excluding them from justification and salvation if they yeeld not perfect and perpetuall obedience which by reason of the flesh is impossible
from this curse christ hath freed us in being made

a curse for us bearing the punishment due for our sinnes and from this exaction of perfect righteousnesse to be performed by our selves hee hath freed us in being made unto us of god

righteousnesse

even iehovah our righteousnesse performing perfect obedience to the law for us
but if the gospell which they call the new law require more perfect obedience than the old law unto justification and salvation then doe wee continue in that miserable estate neither doth our blessed and most perfect saviour availe us any thing
neither will this free us from this bondage that with the newe law the grace of the new testament whereby we should be enabled to obey the law is conferred
for first it is conferred onely to those who are already justified and secondly to whom it is conferred it is not given in such perfection in this life but that ever they are sinners in themselves sinne alwayes abiding in them
so that still if wee must be justified by no righteousnesse but that which is inherent in us we remaine in that fearefull bondage seeing we have nothing either to free us from the curse in respect of our former sinnes or to entitle us to the kingdome of heaven our best righteousnesse being unperfect and stayned with the flesh

fourthly the righteousnes required in the new law to justification is either the same with that which was prescribed in the old law or more perfect
if the same how then are we not justified by the works of the law if more perfect then the law of god was not perfect which the scriptures testifie to be so perfect as nothing can bee added thereto
neither did our saviour christ perfect the law by adding more perfection unto it in respect either of the precepts or the counsells which the papists conceive to have bin added by christ to the precepts
for as touching the precepts he did but more perfectly explaine them freeing them from the depravations of the scribes and pharisees who rested in the outward letter as if the law were not spirituall nor did forbid any more but the grosse sins which in the of the law are expressed
and as for the counsells they are also morall duties for omission wherof men may according to the sentence of the law be condemned as not to love our enemyes not to forbeare swearing in ordinary talke not to give a mans goods to the poore

and to follow christ when hee is thereunto required
mat

mar

these things are so manifest that bellarmine

in the end of the next chapter doth confesse them viz that our saviour doth not say except your righteousnesse exceed the righteousnesse of the law and the prophets but of the scribes and pharisees to signisie that his meaning was not so much he should say not at all to adde to the burden of the precepts as to take away the corruptions of the scribes pharisees
and again those things which seem to be most heavie in the new law are to be found in the old as the loving of our enemyes the restrayning of concupiscence such like
for proofe wherof he quotes augustine lib contr
adimant cap

lib
contr
faustum
in the former place augustine saith nulla in evangelica at{que apostolica disciplina reperiuntur quamvis ardua divina precepta promissa quae illis etiam libris veterib desint
in the latter vel omnia vel penè omnia quia monuit su praecepit christus ubi adjungebat ego a dici vobis inveniuntur in illis veterib libris
and so much of the first difference


xxi
the second difference is that the law commeth alone but

the gospell is accompanied with grace
which is not a difference of the doctrine and letter of the gospell from the law but of the covenant of grace from the covenant of works
for in the covenant of grace as justification is promised to them that being called doe beleeve so sanctification to them that are justifyed
which as it proveth the concurrence of good workes with faith in the party justified as consequents thereof so it excludeth them from being any causes of justification
but as touching this second difference two popish errours are to bee avoided
first in respect of the covenant of workes
for though that covenant doth not promise nor afford the grace of sanctification wherby a man should be enabled to performe the covenant which grace is promised in the covenant of grace and given to them that beleeve yet wee are not so to conceive that they who lived in the time of the law were void of grace nor all that live under the gospell are endued with grace
for the covenant of grace hath alwayes bene in force from the beginning so that to the faithfull who beleeved in the messias which was to come the grace of sanctification was given according to the covenant of grace so that in the old testament even under the law there were as excellent examples of holynesse as have bene in the time of the new under the gospell
so also the law hath its use even among those that live under the gospell insomuch that untill men doe beleeve they are under the law and not under grace
secondly in respect of the grace of the new testament that it is not promised in such perfection in this life where wee receive but the first fruits

of the spirit as that wee may expect to be justified by it or saved for it


xxii
from these two difference the rest as hee saith arise viz from the first arise the third the fourth and the fifth
the third is this that the law of moses was given to one nation the law of

christ to all nations
the fourth that the law of moses for the most

part contayned shadowes and figures of things to come the gospell exhibiteth

the body and truth
the fifth that the law of moses because it was not perfect was to be changed by the law of christ but the law of christ was

not to be changed by any succeeding law

these three differences of the law doe not agree to the law morall which belongeth to all nations which did not consist of shadowes and figures which was not to be changed no not by addition because it was and is a perfect immutable and perpetuall rule of righteousnesse
the other three viz the sixth seventh and eigth arise as hee saith from the second
the sixth that the law of

moses had no power to justifie neither was it given that it might justifie but that it might shew the disease and stirre up men to seeke the physitian
but the law of christ that is the gospell hath power to justifie and was given to that end
for as hee alleageth out of rom

it is the power of god to salvation to every one that beleeveth he doth not say that worketh
for therein is revealed the righteousnesse of god from faith to faith as it is written the just man shall live by faith
this is a true difference of the law of faith from the law of workes but agreeth not to bellarmines new law which is a law of workes as well as the old conteyning the very same morall precepts with the morall law in

the observation whereof not our justification but our sanctification consisteth prescribing also the same righteousnesse viz charity which is the summe of the law
the seventh that the law of moses is a law of fearefullnesse and bondage but the gospell the law of love and of liberty which is true
for the obedience of men who are under the law is forced by the terrour and coaction of the law working servile feare in them
but the obedience of men who are under grace that is of men justified is voluntary and cheerfull proceeding from faith and from some measure of assurance of gods love and favour to them in christ
therfore this voluntary obedience is no cause but a consequent of justification not onely before god but also in the court of our owne conscience that is not onely of justification it

selfe but also of the assurance thereof in some measure
of the eigth which confuteth the first have already spoken


xxiii
so much of the first thing which bellarmine undertooke

to demonstrate for the proofe of the necessity of good workes which we hold as well and urge as much as he
now followeth the second which is to prove

that the justare not free from the observation of the law of god
for hee saith that we place christian liberty in this that we are not subject in our conscience and before god to any law and that the decalogue it selfe doth not belong unto us
which is a most devillish slander
we professe that we so many as truly beleeve are by christ freed from the curse of the law from the rigour and exaction of the law requiring perfect righteousnesse in us unto justification from the terrour and coaction of the law from the irritation of the law as have shewed in my treatise of christian liberty but not from the obedience of it
for freedome from obedience is the servitude of sinne
but wee being freed from sinne

become the servants of righteousnesse
and we

doe freely professe that by how much wee have received the greater favours from god in redeeming us and bringing us into the liberty of his children in freeing us from sinne and from the yoake of the law by so much the more are we bound to obedience not to be justified or saved by it but to testifie our thankefulnesse and to glorifie god who hath beene so gracious unto us much more might be said concerning christian liberty but this is as much as is pertinent to the question in hand
if any desire to bee better informed in this point referre them to my treatise of christian liberty which published many yeaes agoe

cap that good workes are not necessary by necessity of efficacie




all this while bellarmine as we have seene hath wandred from the question but now he saith he will come neerer unto it
for now hee will prove the necessity of good workes not onely by way of presence but by wy of efficacie
but to what will he prove them necéssary to justification no such matter
but yet that is the question which hee ought to prove if hee will disprove justification by faith alone that good workes doe concurre to justification as causes thereof
for though they were as they are not causes of salvation yet it is manifest that they are consequents and therefore no causes of justification
so that bellarmine though hee be come neerer the question yet he is not come home to it
but perhaps it will be said that bellarmine prevented this objection when he first

propounded this as his fifth principall argument to prove that faith doth not justifie alone because good workes are necessary to salvation
his argument may thus be frarned
if faith did justifie alone then it would save alone but faith doth not save alone without good workes which are necessary to salvation in those that are come to yeares
therefore faith doth not justifie alone without good workes which are so necessary to salvation etiam hominibus justificatis even to them that are justified that without them faith alone doth not save
answ
the proposition is denied first by bellarmine himselfe who teacheth though falsely that not all who are justified shall bee saved when notwithstanding the apostle saith

hom the lord hath justified he also hath glorified
and further he holdeth that they who are justified may utterly and finally lose their justification though they lose not their faith and farther that they may also lose their faith

which as he absurdly teacheth is lost by any act of infidelity and consequently both their justification and salvation
yea but saith bellarmine their justice cannot be lost nor their salvation whiles they have faith if they be justified by faith onely
but bellarmine himselfe saith though falsely that the faith of them who are justified may be lost and with it their salvation and therefore by his doctrine a man bee justified by faith and yet not be saved by it
secondly it is denied by some of the fathers who though they teach that faith alone sufficeth to justification as you have heard yet deny that it alone sufficeth to salvation because some other things as namely good workes are thereunto required
to the assumption that saith alone doth not save if such a faith be meant as is alone severed from charity and void of workes doe confesse that it neither saveth nor yet justifieth doe not say alone but not at all
but if he speake of a true lively faith in christ which purifieth the heart and worketh by love of which onely we speake and understand it relatively as we doe then constantly affirme that faith in christ alone that is christ alone received by faith is the onely meritorious cause of our salvation and that neither workes nor any other graces are causes of salvation unlesse hee meane caussas sine quibus non which are no causes


ii
but for the further proofe of his consequences bellarmine

saith that we cannot deny them because luther teacheth that a christian man cannot lose his salvation unlesse he will not beleeve and that the ltherans affirme that salvation as well as justification is to bee ascribed to faith alone
answ
wee can deny what either luther or those that are called lutherans doe affirme without warrant of gods word therefore this was but a slender proofe
howbeit we doe not deny that assertion of luther nor the like which though full of true comfort yet are most maliciously calumniated by the papists as if hee taught men not to care what sinnes they commit so that they can say they have faith
whereas luther delivereth speeches of that kinde to comfort the distressed consciences labouring under the burden of sinne assuring them that although their sinnes bee many and great yet they ought not to despaire if they can finde in their heart to beleeve in christ
which is most true
for though our sinnes be many the mercies of god are more though great yet the merrits of christ are greater
and though the lutherans doe say that salvation as well as justification is to bee ascribed to faith alone yet that is no proofe of bellarmines consequence but a flat deniall of his assumption which it behoveth him to prove
upon these things thus premised bellarmine inferreth that all the testimonies which afterwards namely in his fourth booke he was to alleage out of scriptures and fathers to prove that good workes are so necessary to salvation even to men that are justified that without them faith alone doth not save them doe also prove that faith alone doth not justifie which is the thing saith hee which wee have undertaken to prove which notwithstanding wee doe constantly deny protesting against this inference of bellmine and affirming that although good

workes be so necessary to salvation as that that faith which is without them doth not save a man yet that doth not hinder our assertion that faith doth justifie alone because they doe not concurre to the act of justification at all and much lesse as the causes thereof for they follow justification though ordinarily they goe before salvation and howsoever that faith which is alone severed from charity and destitute of good workes doth neither justifie as have shewed heretofore nor save yet notwithstanding faith relatively understood that is christ received by faith doth save alone


iii
but to returne to his fourth booke though bellarmine still

doe wander yet must be content to follow him
to prove therefore that good workes are necessary to salvation by necessity of efficiency

as causes thereof hee useth three kindes of proofes testimonies of scriptures sentences of fathers and reason
out of the scriptures hoe produceth tenne testimonies besides some whole epistles
the first testimony heb

for patience is necessary for you that doing

the will of god ye may receive the promise
here first saith he wee have the terme necessary and that unto salvation contrary to the lutherans who deny good workes to be necessary to salvation and againe we have that patience is necessary not onely in respect of presence but also of relation to salvation that they may receive the promise
answ
hee hath not here the terme necessary but in the vulgar translation the phrase in the originall is undefined span alphabet opus habetis you have need of patience which phrase is often used in the scriptures to signifie things usefull or needfull without any shew or colour of signification implying the necessity of efficiency as matth


your father knoweth whereof undefined span alphabet you have need the lord undefined span alphabet hath need of the asse and her colt matth


buy those things undefined span alphabet whereof we have need against the feast ioh


but wee grant that patience is a necessary vertue and that also to salvation yea but it is necessary saith he with relation to salvation for so he saith that you may receive the promise
ridiculous for how can it bee necessary to salvation without some relation to it but every relation is not causall or importing a cause as in those examples which he alleageth
meate is necessary that we may be nourished
but many times the relation is of other arguments as of meanes and helpes and such other things without which the thing desired cannot well be had as the asse and her colt were needfull for christ going to ierusalem
shooes or bootes are needfull for him that travaileth
and such is the relation of the way to the journies end
hee therefore that would goe to heaven had need to goe the way which leadeth to it that is the way of good workes which god hath prepared for us to walke in them
and that is the meaning of this place yee have need of patience as of a necessary fruit of faith that having by faith runne the race

that is set before you viz
of patience you may come to the end of your faith which is the salvation of your soules


iv
his second testimony tim


the woman being

deceived was in the transgression
but shee shall be saved by bearing of children if shee continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety
where saith hee perseverance not onely in faith but in faith love sanctification and sobriety is put as necessary to salvation and as a certaine condition without which the woman cannot bee saved
answ
all this we grant but conditio sine qua non is no cause nor doth import any efficiency
if hee would have taken hold of any thing in this text as implying efficiencie hee should rather have urged the phrase undefined span alphabet per filiorum generationem by as it is better translated than by bearing of children to avoid ambiguity because it is said in the words following if they shall continue which is not to bee understood of the children but of the woman that is to say the sexe which being a word collective signifying a multitude is per synthesin joyned to a verbe of the plurall as turbaruunt
as if childebearing were a cause or had some relation of efficiency to salvation which notwithstanding is so farre from being in it selfe a cause of salvation that it was inflicted upon that sexe as a curse
howbeit to the faithfull the nature of it as of all other afflictions which in themselves be evill is changed and they sanctified to them as the strait way or as the word

undefined span alphabet signifieth a way of affliction by which

they are to come to heaven
in such places therefore though the preposition undefined span alphabet which many times importeth a cause bee used yet not the cause but sometimes the way is signified and sometimes the estate the way as acts

paul and barnabas confirming the soules of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith affirmed undefined span alphabet by or through many aflictions wee must enter into the kingdome of god
not that afflictions or the patient bearing of them is the cause of salvation as the papists would collect out of some other places but that afflictions patiently borne are the way to it
the estate as rom

abraham the father of all that beleeve undefined span alphabet being in uncircumcision
so in this place as beza hath well observed where undefined span alphabet is put for undefined span alphabet
and him doth bellarmine follow
this is to bee noted saith hee

that per by the bearing of children is put for in
for it was not the apostles meaning that procreation of children is a cause of salvation but that a woman in the state of marriage or in the state of childebearing shall bee saved if shee abide in the faith




his third testimony phil


with feare and trembling

worke your salvation
surely saith hee if good actions worke salvation they are necessary not onely by way of presence but also of efficiency
answ
very true
but where doth the apostle say that good actions doe worke salvation hee exhorteth indeed the philippians that they should worke or rather worke out their salvation not that they are the authours or workers of it for salvation and every degree thereof is the worke of god
we are his workemanship

even in respect of our spirituall life

he hath made us and not we our selves

he worketh all our workes in us

wee are not able to thinke a good

thought as of our selves but as it followeth in the next words

god worketh in us both to will and to doe according to his good pleasure
and we are to observe that this exhortation is directed to the

saints at philippi in whom god had begun this good worke
as therefore god himselfe having begun this worke would as the apostle saith finish it

or bring it to perfection so the apostle exhorteth them who had entred into the course of salvation that they should goe on in the same course cooperating with god and accomplishing their sanctification in the feare of god as the apostle elsewhere

speaketh


vi
his fourth testimony
cor

for the sorrow that

is according to god worketh penance unto salvation that is stable
here also wee see saith hee the respect of efficiency
for sorrow worketh penance penance worketh stable salvation
for sorrow doth truly worke in a man penance that is detestation of sinne and a purpose to avoid sinne
therefore penance also it selfe dth truly worke stable salvation and is therefore necessary not one in regard of presence but as a cause
answ
it is true that godly sorrow or the spirit of god by it worketh undefined span alphabet repentance never to be repented of even repentance unto salvation
but it is not said that either godly sorrow or repentance doth worke salvation
but the apostle saith that godly sorrow worketh repentance even such repentance as is a forerunner unto salvation or as the faithfull speake act


that god had given the gentiles repentance unto life and therefore such a repentance as was not to bee repented of
for the apostle seemeth to have relation unto his owne words verse
that he had repented that hee had made them sorry
but when hee understood that their sorrow had brought forth in them repentance he did not repent thereof
repentance therefore which is unto salvation is indeed a necessary and undoubted forerunner of salvation and salvation a certaice consequent of repentance necessary say because without it a sinner cannot bee saved luke

undoubted because to whom god hath given grace truely to repent it is an infallible token that such an one shall be saved acts

but a cause of salvation it is not neither can bee unlesse hee meane causa sine qua non


vii
his fifth testimony
cor

for that our tribulation

which presently is momentany and light worketh above measure exceedingly an eternall weight of glory in us
what could bee spoken more plainely if patience in tribulation doth worke a weight of eternall glory who can deny but that there is some relation betweene patience and salvation vnlesse perhaps to worke salvation be not to worke something or that upon the working there followeth no relation
answ
if the apostle had said that patience in affliction doth worke an eternall weight of glory hee might from thence have had some colour that patience hath a relation of efficiency to salvation and yet but a colour
but when the apostle doth not once mention patience how could hee bee so confident as to aske what could bee spoken more plainely the

apostle speaketh of affliction both light and momentany and saith that it undefined span alphabet worketh unto us an eternall weight of glory
here then wee are to consider in what sence affliction which in it selfe is evill and miserable should worke glory and happinesse being light should worke that which is most ponderous being momentany should worke that which is eternall whether as a cause properly and in it owne nature causing or working or as an occasion which besides or rather contrary to it owne nature which is evill is to us sanctified of god to be a meanes and occasion of our so great good
and to this purpose let us consult with other places of holy scripture as rom

and iam

in the former place the apostle saith wee rejoyce in afflictions knowing that affliction undefined span alphabet worketh patience and so saint iames

not that affliction in it selfe worketh patience but rather the contrary as appeareth in men unregenerate whom it maketh to murmure and sometimes to blaspheme god which the divell by experience well knew when hee moved god to fflict iob chap



doe but touch all that he hath saith he and againe touch his bone and his flesh and hee will curse thee to thy face
but afflictions are said to worke patience in the faithfull because the holy ghost sanctifieth their afflictions to them and excercising them thereby worketh in them patience and what followeth patience worketh undefined span alphabet probation that is as have formerly expounded it maketh him that by affliction is tryed undefined span alphabet
not that patience maketh him undefined span alphabet but that by patient bearing of affliction hee is found and knowne to be undefined span alphabet that is a sound approved and upright christian
for therefore god sendeth tryals of all sorts that those who are

undefined span alphabet may bee knowne
now when men have beene by patient bearing of afflictions found to bee undefined span alphabet they are crowned with eternall life as saint iames saith chap

blessed is the man who patiently beareth temptation that is affliction for when hee shall bee found to bee undefined span alphabet hee shall receive the crowne of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him
the meaning therefore of this place is neither that affliction causeth patience nor patience salvation but that when the godly are afflicted the holy ghost by affliction where with they are exercised worketh patience in them and patience worketh probation because by patience when they are tryed they are knowne to bee sound and approved and probation worketh hope of salvation
for when upon try all men are found to bee approved they shall receive the crowne of life which god hath freely promised to give them
and it is to be observed that the word undefined span alphabet which is translated to worke is given not onely to causes but also to occasions
and therefore in such places undefined span alphabet doth signifie it occasioneth as when it it said rom

the law undefined span alphabet worketh anger


viii
his sixth testimony
rom

if by the spirit yee mortifie the deeds of the flesh you shall live whence hee would prove that the mortification of carnall concpiscence is necessary to salvation

as a condition and cause and therefore hath relation to salvation from the conditionall particle if and from the antithesis of the words going before if you live according to the flesh you shall die
answ
the conditionall particle used in conditionall or connexive propositions alwayes pretendeth a necessity of consequence insomuch that the connexion if it bee not necessary is not absolutely true but the necessity of efficiency it implyeth none
and as for the necessity of consequence that ariseth not onely from causes but from all other arguments
and whereas from the antithesis hee would prove that as to live according to the flesh causeth death so to mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the spirit causeth life answere that in both the parts the connexion or consequence is equally that is necessarily true for if it were not necessary it were not absolutely true but it is absolutely true because of the authority of the scriptures which are infallible which is sufficient to make good the antithesis
but hence it followeth not that the condition of either part should be taken from the same arguments seeing it may bee taken from any other
this sufficeth for the antithesis that if by the spiri ye mortifie the deeds of the flesh it is an evident argument that you shall live but if you live according to the flesh it is an evident argument that you shall dye therefore though the condition of the latter part bee the cause of the consequent yet it is not so in the former for sinne is the meritorious cause of damnation but our obedience being a duety and yet but unperfect cannot merit salvation
a servant not doing his duety but the contrary is punished
a servant doing or rather but endeavouring to doe his duety is rewarded
in these two the arguments are not the same
a servant that doth not his duety deserveth punishment and his disobedience is the meritorious cause of his punishment
but by doing his duety especially if it bee done unperfectly which is alwayes our case he doth not deserve reward and therefore if hee bee rewarded it is to be ascribed to his masters bounty and not to his desert
such an antithesis the apostle maketh betweene the reward of sinne and of godlinesse rom

death is the due wages of sinne but eternall life which is the reward of godlinesse is the free gift of god
and further as said before when formerly answered this allegation in this and many other such conditionall speeches the antecedent is not the cause but a signe token or presage of the consequent
if god have given you grace to mortifie the deeds of the flesh it is an evident token that you shall live
if god hath adorned you with his grace it is to be presumed that he will crowne his owne grace with glory


ix
and such is his seventh testimony as before have shewed

rom

the spirit beareth witnesse with our spirits that we are the sonnes and heires of god and coheires with christ if we suffer with him that wee may also bee glorified with him where is no relation at all of efficiency betwixt our sufferings and glory
but bellarmine will prove it first by the conditionall particle of which

spake in answere to the last argument which doth not as hee saith point out the cause but the evidence by which the holy ghost doth assure us that wee are the sonnes and heires of god and coheires of christ who shall bee glorified with him namely if we suffer with him
secondly from the reason which is added concerning the excesse of glory to our sufferings which to my understanding doth plainly confute it
for if the sufferings of this life be not condigne as the vulgar readeth it to the glory that is to come how should they merit it ex condigno as they arrogantly speake but the scope of the apostle in this place is to encourage the faithfull to suffer for christ which he doth by two arguments the one from the happy event which is assurance of glorification testified by the holy spirit who testifieth unto us that if we have grace from god to suffer with christ that we are the sonnes and heires of god and coheires of christ who shall bee glorified with him
not that ou sufferings doe make us the sonnes and heires of god but that they are the signes and evidences by which the holy ghost doth assure us that we are so
the other from the disproportion betweene our sufferings from him and the glory which we shall have with him
for the aposle having weighed both resolveth for so hee saith undefined span alphabet that all the sufferings of this life are not comparable to that glory but of this place more hereafter



his eighth testimony rom

with the heart wee beleeve

unto righteousnesse and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
we see here saith he that faith sufficeth not to salvation because it is not

true and entire in the heart unlesse thereto be added externall confession
and it seemeth that the apostle alludeth to that speech of our saviour matth


him that confesseth me before men will confesse before my father and him that denyeth me before men will deny before my father that is in heaven

answ
all this we confesse that besides faith confession and many other graces and duties are necessary to salvation not as causes but as causae sine quibus non as have often said which are no causes


xi
his ninth testimony matth


come yee blessed

of my father possesse the kingdom prepared for you before the beginning of the world
for was hungry and you gave mee to eate surely saith hee the reason which is rendred doth plainely shew that good workes are aliquo modo some way causes of salvation and that for them the kingdome of heaven is given
answ
of this place have spoken before

when shewed that the causes of salvation were noted vers
come yee blessed of my father inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world
and the reason which is rendred is taken from good workes not as the cause for which salvation is given but as the evidence according to which our saviour judgeth


xii
his tenth testimony is out of the epistle of saint iames and

it is twofold the former iam

he that is not a forgetfull hearer but a doer of the worke this man shall bee blessed in his deed the latter iam

what will it profit my brethren if a man say that he hath faith

and have not workes will faith save him but how saith hee out of the former is a man blessed in his deed if his deeds have no relation to happinsse but affodiheir idle presence
answ
wee confesse that good works have relation to happinesse as they are necessary unto it as the way as the causa sine qua non
neither doe conceive how good works can be idle where they are present though they doe not merit that which infinitely exceedeth their worth
and as touching the other place iam
we confesse also that that faith which is in profession onely and is void of good workes doth not save a man because it is an idle and dead faith
this therefore proveth good workes to be necessary necessitate praesentiae but for necessity efficioncie there is no shew nor colour


xiii
after those severall testimonies he appealeth to the whole

epistles of peter iohn iames and iude whose chiefe intention was to prove that to justified men good workes are necessary to salvation and that faith alone doth not suffice as some in these times out of the epistles of paul not well understood began to preach
answere that as the apostles whom he nameth urge the necessity of good workes so doe all true preachers of the gospell at this day yea paul himselfe did urge it

as much as any of them if not more
but the necessity of efficiencie he may as soone prove out of our sermons as out of the writings of the apostles


xiv
to the scriptures hee addeth the testimonies of the fathers

who as they censured for heretickes those which denyed workes to bee necessary unto salvation so themselves taught that they bee necessary
to which both censure and doctrine of the fathers wee doe most willingly subscribe
and wee should greatly wonder how this great master of controversies could bee so idle so impertinent so frivolous a disputant but that as said before these his discourses proving the necessity of good workes though they bee impertinent to the maine question because they prove not that which is in controversie betwixt us yet are not impertinent to his purpose which was to calumniate us and to beare the world in hand that wee are such as deny the necessity of good workes
but if the question were tryed by voices of the fathers innumerable testimonies might bee produced out of their writings wherein they teach that wee are justified by faith and not by workes yea in direct termes affirming that which is the question betweene us that we are justified by faith

alone
but that workes are necessary as causes either to salvation or which is the question to justification not any one pregnant testimony out of the ancient fathers is or as suppose can bee produced
but to prove the necessity of good workes by way of presence shall not need to recite the severall testimonies seeing have my

selfe delivered more to prove and to urge the necessity of good workes than can be gathered out of all these testimonies put together


xv
in the third and last place he bringeth a reason like to that

which he framed

cap

that faith alone doth not justifie
but doth he not dispute the same question here did he not propound five

principall arguments to prove that faith doth not justifie alone the fifth and

last wherof was from the necessity of good works the handling whereof

hee put off to this place
should he not then from the necessity of good workes prove that faith doth not justifie alone
but in stead of proving that hee endevoureth to prove that faith doth not save alone
thus craftily hee glydeth from one question to another for his owne advantage because hee knew that more is required to salvation than was required to justification
for sanctification commeth betwixt justification and salvation
and although we are justified without works going before justification yet we are not saved without workes going before salvation they being the way which god hath prepared for them that are justified to walke in towards their glorification
might therefore according to the lawes of disputation hold him to the question or refuse to give him answere
but he is so farre from proving that faith doth not justifie alone that hee is not able to prove that it doth not save alone disputing in that sence according to which we doe hold that faith doth justifie alone
now for the understanding of our sence and meaning certaine distinctions heretofore propounded must for avoiding of calumniations bee here repeated
first that wee doe not meane that faith is the onely grace which doth sanctifie as the papists will needes misunderstand us but that to sanctification not only other graces doe concurre with faith but good workes also
and consequently that besides faith the said graces and good workes be forerunners of our salvation
secondly when wee say faith alone wee doe not meane that faith which is alone being a solitary an idle a counterfeit and dead faith severed from charity and other graces and destitute of goodworks but we meane a true and lively aith which purifieth the heart and worketh by love which cannot be severed from charity and other graces as have heretofore proved
and therefore wee hold that although in respect of the act of justifying or saving it alone yet in respect of the being thereof it never is nor if it be a true justifying and savingfaith can be alone
thirdly when we doe say that faith alone justifieth and saveth wee speake with relation to the object or relatively meaning that the object which faith alone receiveth doth justifie and save us when wee say therefore that we are justified or saved by faith alone our meaning is that we are justified only by the righteousnesse of christ which is apprehended by faith alone and not by our owne righteousnesse and that wee are saved by the merits of christ alone received by faith and not by our owne workes or merits and consequently that christ received by faith is the onely meritorious cause of our salvation


xvi
now let us heare bellarmines dispute
iffaith alone did

save and that workes were not otherwise ecessary than in respect of presence as the fruits and signes of faith then it would follow that faith could save though it wanted all maner of good workes and were joyned with all maner of vices and sinnes but the consequent is false therfore saith hee faith alone doth not save and good workes are necessary not onely in regard of presence but also of some efficiencie
to the proposition answere first that it is senselesse and implyeth a contradiction
for if good workes must

necessarily be present with saving faith which hee confesseth wee doe hold how can it be supposed without implying a contradiction that it can save being not onely destitute of all good workes but also accompanied with all maner of sinne this is sufficient to overthrowe his whole dispute
secondly deny the consequence of his proposition
for justifieing and saving faith though it justifie and save alone yet it never is nor can be alone
even as the eye in respect of his being cannot if it be a true living eye be alone severed from other parts of the body yet in respect of the act of seeing unto which no other part doth concurre it seeth alone
even so faith which is the spirituall eye of the soule in respect of its being cannot if it be a true lively faith be alone severed from the other graces which are with it fellow members of sanctification but yet in respect of the act of justifying and saving unto which no other graces concurre with it as any causes therof it justifyeth and saveth alone because it alone and no other grace doth receive christ unto justification and salvation
thirdly we do not say that the presence of good workes is necessary to salvation onely as they are the fruits and signes of faith but also as necessary forerunners as causa sine qua non as the way to salvation and as the evidence according to which the sentence shall be pronounced
which consideration disproveth the proofe of his consequence which is that according to our doctrine good workes are required to the act of saving onely by accident whose presence addeth nothing to the virtue of faith in justifying and saving and so their absence detracteth nothing from it and therefore being taken away faith never the lesse saveth

answ
things whose presence is necessary cannot be said to bee present by accident
for such may be present or absent but that which is necessary cannot be otherwise the thing being safe
but we hold the presence of workes not to be contingent but necessary both in respect of salvation as the way to it and as causa sine qua non and of faith as the unseparable fruits of it without which it is said to be dead
for what will it profit a man saith st iames

if hee shall say that hee hath faith and hath not workes will that faith save him for as the body without the spirit is dead

so that faith which is in profession onely and is without workes is dead


xvii
but this reason of his hee doth illustrate by two unlike

similitudes
for saith hee even as fire because by its heat alone it heateth if from the fire were taken away all other qualityes which are by accident joyned with heat it would still without doubt heat
and as a father because by the onely relation of paternity hee hath reference to his sonne if from him who is a father all other attributes were removed as knowledgen bility power health beauty and in stead os them there should succeed ignorance basenesse weaknes sicknes deformity and among all these attributes paternity should remaine yet still that father should have relation to his sonne even so because a christian apprehendeth salvation by faith alone and unto it is referred by our adversaryes surely it followeth that faith remayning hee may

be saved although hee have no good workes and have many ill

answ
in the former similitude hee compareth a christian man to fire faith to heat and other graces and good workes to such other qualityes as in fire by accident concurre with heat
in which similitude nothing is like
for neither doth a christian man justifie or save others by faith as fire by his heat doth heat other things neither is hee justified or saved by his faith as it is a quality inherent but as it is the hand to receive christ neither are other graces or duetyes of sanctification which wee call good workes to be compared with know not what accidentall qualityes concurring with heat but to those unseparable qualityes of fire viz light and drynes
for even in the fire that is inflamed there doe concurre necessarily with heat drynesse and light neither were it a true fire without them and yet the act of heating is to be ascribed to the heat of the fire properly and not to the light or drynesse of the element so in a true christian that is justified there doth concurre necessarily with faith both other sanctifying graces answerable to the drynesse of the fire and also the light of a christian conversation without which hee is not to be held a true christian or truely justified and yet the act of justifying or saving is not to be ascribed either to other graces or to good workes but onely to faith receiving christ or rather to christ onely received by faith
in the other similitude he compareth the reference which faith hath to salvation unto that relation with is betweene father and sonne
but faith and salvation are no such relatives
neither are the graces of the sanctification or good workes to be compared to those accidentall adjuncts attributed to a father which may come and goe as being not necessary to the being of a father but rather to those properties of the humane nature as reason will understanding wit
for although a man cannot become a father without these yet his being a father is not not to be ascribed to these


xviii
and whereas hee would seeme to take away the answeare of his adversaties who alleage that his supposition is impossible both because in his first booke he had proved that saith may truely and indeed be severed from charity and good workes and also because at least in conceit it may be severed from them which he saith is sufficient for the confirmation of an hypotheticall prposition neither can his adversaries deny it who teach thah faith and workes have that relation which is betweene the cause and the effect hereunto reply first that have formerly not onely answered his arguments which hee produced to this purpose

but also proved by unanswereable arguments that true justifying faith cannot be severed from charity and good workes
secondly as said even nowe his supposition implyeth a contradiction and therefore is impossible
impossible say that workes being supposed to bee present necessitate presentiae should in the same speech be truely supposed to be absent
thirdly if bellarmine can conceive that true justifying and saving faith may be without charity and good

workes then hee may also conceive that that faith may save which is severed from charity and destitute of good workes

his assumption grant for wee teach according to the scriptures that that faith which is alone severed from charity and good works doth justify or save neither alone nor at all and doe ascribe lesse to such a faith than the papists themselves doe
but his conclusion is faulty as contayning more than can be inferred upon the premisses that good workes are necessary not onely in regard of presence but also of some efficiencie which was not so much as mentioned in the antecedent of the proposition which the conclusion should gainsay and say no more
thus much of the necessity of good workes

chap
vi
of the verity of the justice of works and of the possibilitie of fulfilling the law


now bellarmine will discourse of the truth of the justice of workes or of actuall righteousnesse

and in this dispute he spendeth eigth chapters

but to what end for feare hee wandreth still
hee had in the first booke propounded five principall arguments to prove that faith doth not justifie alone
the fifth and last was that good workes also doe justifie and therefore not faith alone
this assertion hee laboureth to prove by divers arguments
the first from the necessity of good workes which have answeared
the second from the verity of the justice of workes namely that the good workes of the faithfull and regenerate are truely good which wee doe not deny wee say indeed that the seeming good workes of men unregenerate are not truely good because an evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit
but the good workes of the regenerate being the workes of grace and the fruits of the spirit wee acknowledge to be truely good
but will it hereupon followe that therfore they are or may be justified by workes nothing lesse
hee must prove that the workes of the regenerate are not onely truely good but also purely and perfectly good and not onely that but that they are also perpetually and universally good
for if they faile in any one particular as in

many things we saith iames the just offend all they cannot be justified by their obedience
for hee that offendeh in one is guilty

of the breach of the whole law and is so farre from being justified by his obedience that by the sentence of the law hee is accursed because

he hath not continued in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them unlesse therfore he can prove that not onely some but all the workes of the faithfull are not onely truely but also purely and perfectly good which is impossible to be proved he cannot possibly conclude that they are justified by them will you then know to what end serveth this discourse the subtile sophister because hee would seeme to have the better end of the staffe chooseth rather to confute our pretended errours than to defend his owne


ii
but indeed this whole dispute is defensive serving to answeare

a piece of one of our arguments against justification by inherent righteousnesse because our obedience is neither totall nor perfect nor perpetuall
not totall because wee neither doe nor can fulfill the whole law of god
not perfect nor pure because it is stayned with the flesh
not perpetuall because interrupted either by omission of duetyes or commission of sinnes
to the two former bellarmine answereth the third being unanswerable and maintayneth the contrary assertions setting downe the state of the question thus whether men justified may by the helpe of gods grace so fulfill the law of god that their workes are not onely not to be called sinnes but also deserve truely and properly to be called just
but this question commeth short of that which hee ought to prove in two respects
for first if the just meaning all the just are justified by their workes hee must proove that not onely some choice men may by the speciall help of gods grace fulfill the law but that all doe or else hee must confesse that they are not justified by their obedience
neither is it sufficient that their workes be not sinnes or truely just unlesse their workes not some but all be not onely truely but also purely good
but of this question so propounded by him he saith that we whom hee calleth heretickes hold the negative the papists who are no heretikes hold the affirmative whose assertion hee setteth downe in three articles

first that the law of god to just men is absolutely possible not indeed by the onely strength of nature but by the help of divine grace
secondly that the workes of the righteous are simply and absolutely just and after their maner prefect
thirdly that a man is truely justified by workes
thus you see how as it were by chance hee stumbleth upon the maine question where unto his whole dispute ought to be referred bringing it in as a proofe of the verity of the justice of good workes wher by it selfought to be either proved or defended otherwise all this discourse of the verity of good workes is impertinent
these three he saith hee will prove in order
and in all three must have the patience to followe him


iii
and first of the possibility or impossibility of fulfilling the law
concerning which what wee doe hold may appeare by

these distinctions for first wee doe not hold that it is absolutely impossible

for god if it so please him can enable man perfectly to fulfill the law as hee did in our first creation and as hee will doe at our full redemption
but in this estate since the fall to a man living in the flesh it is not possible
and thus

augustine if the question bee whether god bee able to make a man to live without sinne doth freely confesse it but if the question bee whether god ever enabled any man to be without sinne that he denyeth
the second distinction is concerning the regenerate and the unregenerate
for unto the unregenerate being fallen in adam the law through their owne fault is impossible
but the regenerate may bee said to keepe the whole law and that in three respects
first in regard of their faith for hee ithat truely beleeveth in christ hath fulfilled the law

for christ is undefined span alphabet the end and complement of the law to every one that beleeveth his obedience being imputed to them
qui credit in christum saith

theodoret scopum legis adimplet he that beleeveth in christ fulfilleth the scope of the law and

photius undefined span alphabet the apostle therefore saith that hee which beleeveth in christ fulfilleth the law
ambrose likewise on those

words not the hearers of the law but the doers shall be justified hoc dicit saith hee quia non hi justi sunt qui audiunt legem sed qui credunt in christum quem tex promisit hoc est facere legem
this hee saith because not they are jst who heare the law but they who beleeve in christ whom the law promised and this is to performe the law and againe qui credit in christum hic fecisse legem dicitur whosoever beleeveth in christ hee is said to have performed the law
the like hath sedulius that faith standeth for the perfection of the whole law in rom

secondly in respect of our new obedience
thirdly in respect of gods acceptation accepting of our syncere though weake endevour and pardoning our defectivenesse therein which being forgiven our obedience is reputed as if wee had performed all
for as augustine saith

omnia ergo mandata facta deputantur quando quicquid non fit ignoscitur
all the commandements are esteemed as done when that which is not done is pardoned
but the question is properly understood of our new obedience in regard whereof another distinction is to bee acknowledged betweene the keeping or observing of the law and the fulfilling of it which the papists feeme to confound
for all the faithfull by their new obedience keepe the law according to the measure

of grace received but none fulfill it
their new obedience consisting in studio pretatis justitia in the study of piety and righteousnesse whereby they are studious of good workes
this study standeth in a syneere desire an unfained purpose an upright endevour to walke in the obedience of all gods commandements
and this study and practise of piety though accompanied with manifold yea with many slippes both of omission and commission happening contrary to their generall desire and purpose through humane infirmity the lord who in his children accepteth

of the will for the deed esteemeth so highly of that those things which are done with an upright heart and syncere endevour are said

in the scriptures to bee done with the whole soule and with a perfect heart which must be evangelically and not legally understood this perfection standing not in the perfect performance but in the uprightnesse of the heart striving towards perfection
thus all the faithfull keepe the law who have a syncere desire purpose and endevour to obey it but none doe or can fulfill it unlesse they continue in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them
which never any since the fall christ onely excepted were able to doe for the law is kept with the heart psal



but not fulfilled but by the

whole man say the whole man performing the whole law alwaies


iv
but that the law is possible to the faithfull bellarmine endevoureth to prove by scriptures fathers and reason
out of the scriptures he produceth three sorts of testimonies the first of these which testifie that the law is not onely possible but also easie as first mat

for my yoke is easie and my burden light
secondly ioh

and his commandements are not grievous
to the former answere that by the yoke and burden of christ wee are not to understand the yoke of the law exacting perfect obedience to bee performed by us unto justification or for default thereof subjecting us to the curse for this was the chiefe yoke of bondage which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare act


from which our saviour hath

made us free but by the yoke and burden of christ we are to understand his law and doctrine evangelicall which may bee reduced to two heads the law and doctrine of faith the law and doctrine of obedience and that twofold the obedience of his precepts which is called our new obedience and obedientia crucis which is the taking up and bearing our crosse
the law of faith respcteth our justification the doctrine of our new obedience respecteth our sanctification the obedience of the crosse is christian patience or tolerantia crucis
and these yokes or burdens christ is it seemeth would have men comming unto him to take upon them by learning of him which argueth that by them christs doctrine or discipline is meant that they might bee eased from those yokes under which they labour and those burdens under which they are wearied
and these are of two sorts the guilt of sinne which is a most heavie yoke or burden under which the guilty conscience laboureth and the corruption of sin wherewith men being overladen are wearyed
from the former men are freed in their justification by the law of faith which is easie and light christ having taken our burden upon him
for even as the israelites in the wildernesse when they were bitten by the fiery serpents had no greater burden or taske laid upon them than to lift up their eyes towards the brasen serpent and were cured

even so wee when wee are stung by the old serpent and labour under the guilt of sinne and desire to bee eased or

cured thereof this charge our saviour layeth upon us to lift up the eye

of faith to him that was figured by the brasen serpent and wee shall finde rest unto our soules
from the second men are freed in their sanctification by christs law or doctrine of obedience both active and passive
the active is our new obedience whereof as of sanctification there are two parts mortification whereby we dye to sinne and our vivification wherby we live to god both which the doctrine of christ doth teach
tit

the grace of god which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all teaching us that we should renounce all ungodlinesse and wordly lusts there is mortification and that wee should live soberly and justly and holily in this present world there is our vivification
so ephes


those that have learned christ have been taught to be put off the old man and to put on the new



this yoake also is easie to the faithfull and this burden light

first because the faithfull being freed from the terrour and coaction of the law are enabled to obey god with willing minds as not being under the law but under grace
secondly because as the lord promised in the covenant of grace which is the doctrine of the gospell to give grace to the heires of promise wherby they are enabled to serve him with upright hearts and with willing and constant minds so doth he assist them with his grace making them both able and willing to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse

thirdly because the new obedience required of us doth not consist in the perfect performance which the lord doth not expect from such weakenesse as is in the best of us but in the sincere and upright desire purpose and endeavour to walke in obedience according to the measure of grace received

fourthly because our unperfect obedience is accepted of god in christ and the wants thereof pardoned by the intercession of christ who with the odours

of his own sacrifice perfumeth the incense of our prayers and of other duties making them acceptable unto god
and this was figured by that ceremony of the golden

plate as have shewed heretofore which the high priest who was a type of christ was to weare in the foresront of the miter with this inscription holinesse of the lord that is of the messias who is iehovah our righteousnesse to the end that christ figured by the high priest might beare the iniquity of the holy things which the children of israell should hallow in all their holy gifts and it was alwaies to bee upon his forehead that they may be accepted before the lord

fifthly because if through humane frailty the flesh prevailing against the spirit the faithfull doe at any time offend as in many things we all doe we have an advocate with the father christ iesus the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sinnes ioh

he sitting at the right hand of his father maketh intercession for us rom

heb



vi
against the fourth reason bellarmine taketh exception
for

whereas some of our divines have taught as he saith that therefore it

is called an easie yoake and light burden because of the remission of such offences as the faithfull commit he pusheth at them with this dilemma
that this remission or not imputation either taketh away the obligation of the law so that the faithfull hough they doe offend doe inurre no guilt or else doth not take away this obligation but that the faithfull contract the guilt which afterward is remitted
if the former then saith hee it ceasseth to be a law
for it is no law which doth not binde
if the latter then it is a hard yake and a heavy burden which cannot be borne
to the former answere that remission is of guilt contracted and therefore it is absurdly surmised that there should be remission where was no guilt
to the latter that according to the law of faith the guilt contracted is remitted to the faithfull returning unto god confessing their sinne and craving pardon in the name and mediation of christ
which proveth the law of workes to bee an hard yoake and heavie burden but the law of faith to be easie and light
for by the law of workes the guilt is contracted and by the law of faith it is remitted


vii
but the obedience of the crosse also serveth to free us

from the corruption of sinne
for hee that hath suffered in the flesh ceasseth from sinne
and therefore david pronounced the man blessed whom the lord chasteneth

and teacheth out of his law
for undefined span alphabet quae nocent docnt
wee learne obedience

by that which wee suffer
david therefore professeth

that it was good for him that hee had been afflicted that hee might learne the statutes of the lord and confesseth that before hee was afflicted

hee went astray but now saith hee have kept thy word
this also is a yoke which ieremy saith it is good for a man to beare even in or from his youth lam

for to the godly it is made an easy yoke and light burden
first in comparison of that superexcellent

eternall weight of glory wherewith the lord doth recompence our momentany and light afflictions which are

no way comparable to the glory which shall be revealed

secondly because affliction worketh patience and patience probation and probation hope and hope of eternall glory makethus to swallow all the difficulties of this life and with patience and comfort to beare afflictions yea to rejoyce and to triumph in them rom



looking unto iesvs

the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the crosse despising the shame and is set downe at the right hand of the throne of god
wherefore saint

iames and saint

peter in their epistles doe teach it to be a matter of joy to the faithfull when they are afflicted

thirdly because the nature of afflictions to the faithfull is changed being not evill not punishments to them but rather blessings as being either fatherly chastisements or tryals for their good which proceeding from gods love are so moderated by his mercy that they doe not exceed their strength cor

and are through gods providence made to worke for their good rom

and profit that they may be partakers of his holinesse heb

affliction therefore

to the faithfull is undefined span alphabet a commodious or easie yoake

fourthly because christ by his spirit doth minister such comfort

to the faithfull in their afflictions that as their sufferings increase so their consolation aboundeth by christ cor



viii
so much of his first testimony
in the second place

ioh

the holy ghost setteth downe two notes whereby wee may know that we love god
for this saith he is the love of god first that we keepe his commandements for this in other places also is made the proper note of his love viz to keepe his commandements exod

iohn

the second that his commandements are not grievous for

nihil difficile amanti
nothing is difficult to him that loveth
and so

augustine answereth the pelagian urging this place quis esse grave quod diligendo fit non timendo
so that if we truely love god we will out of love and not out of servile feare and constraint yeeld willing obedience to the commandements of god
so that this is the meaning to him that loveth god the commandements of god are not grievous but he delighteth in them according to the inner man yeelding voluntary and cheerefull obedience thereto not in perfection but according to the measure of grace received
for when the love of god is shed

abroad in our hearts by the spirit of god assuring us in some measure of gods love towards us then are our hearts enlarged to love god againe and being enlarged

we doe not onely walke but runne also in the way of gods commandments that is willingly and cheerefully according to the measure of our faith and love wee obey them
but though the faithfull doe willingly obey gods commandements so according to their ability yet they cannot perfectly fulfill them


ix
his second sort of testimonies is of such as teach that the

law is kept by them that love

of this sort he citeth three testimonies the first concerning the love of god ioh

if a man love me he will keepe my word
the other
concerning the love of our neighbor rom

he that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law gal


all the law is fulfilled in one word thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe
from hence he argueth thus they that are able to love god and their neighbour are also able to fulfill the law the faithfull are able to love god and their neighbour therefore they are able to fulfill the law
the proposition hee proveth by these three testimonies of scripture
the assumption thus
if we cannot love god and our neighbour then can wee not be the disciples or friends of christ but it is absurd to say that none can be the disciples or friends of christ therefore we are able to love god and our neighbour
the proposition of this prosyllogisme he proveth out of ioh

hereby shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another and iohn

you shall be my friends if you doe the things that command you
now the thing which he did command was that they should love one another
to this long discourse a short answere may suffice we doe confesse that all they who love god and their neighbour doe keepe gods

commandements according to the measure of their love but wee deny that any can fulfill the law of god who have not a full and perfect love and that to the perfection of love such as the law requireth none can attaine in this life
for our knowledge is but in part therefore our love our regeneration is but in part wee being but partly spirituall and partly carnall and therefore our love
the law is impossible by reason of the flesh therefore whiles the flesh remaineth in us the law is not possible unto us


bellarmine confesseth that our charity in this life is unperfect because

it may be increased and because it shall bee greater in our country
notwithstanding he holdeth that it is so perfect as may suffice for the fulfilling of the law
but david saith that the law of god is

perfect and so perfect as nothing may be added thereto and therefore requireth perfect righteousnesse not onely in respect of the parts but also of the degrees unto which nothing can be added
for if any thing can bee added to it then something is wanting which is required to perfection and what is wanting is a fault
peccatum est saith

augustine cum vel non est charitas qu esse debet vel minor est quàm debet
it is a sin either when there is not charity which ought to be or when it is lesse than it ought to be
and no doubt but it is lesse than it ought to be when it is not so great as the law requireth and it is not so great as the law requireth whiles it may be increased
for as

augustine saith quamdi augeri potest charitas profectò illud quod minus est quam debet ex vitio est
whiles charity may be increased assuredly that which is lesse than it ought to be is faulty or vicious
by reason of which vice there is not a righteous man upon earth that doth good and sinneth not
by reason of which vice no man living shall be justified before god
by reason of which vice if we shall say that we have no sinne we deceive our selves and the truth is not in us
and for which though we be never so good proficients we must of necessity say forgive us our debts


xi secondly hee replyeth that the law which prescribeth love requireth no more but that we should love with our whole heart
but that this not onely may be done but also should be done in the new testament the scripture doth witnesse deu

answ
the phrase of loving with the whole heart being legally understood according to the perfection prescribed in the law doth signifie as it soundeth neither can be performed by any mortall man though regenerate because he is partly flesh and partly spirit
neither can more than the law requireth in this behalfe be performed in our country
for as

august
saith in the life to come our love shal be not only above that which here we have but also far above that which we either aske or think
notwithstanding it can be no more than what the law requireth with all our heart with all our soule and with all our minde
for there doth not remaine in us any thing which may be added ad totum to that which is all for if any thing remaine which might bee added then it is not totum all
but the phrase is many times evangelically understood as in the place quoted to signifie not absolute or legall perfection but the

integrity and uprightnesse of the heart which is the evangelicall perfection as have shewed elsewhere

and shall againe ere long declare


xii thirdly he replyeth that the scriptures teach that men may bee perfect in this life
and to this purpose allegeth gen



matth




phil


ioh

the use of the word in these and some other places is to bee distinguished
for in the most of them it is not opposed to imperfection and so many places are impertinently alleaged but either to hypocrisie and so it signifieth up right and sincere as gen



or to partiality when wee are good to some but not to others as matth


be you perfect as your heavenly father is perfect doing good to men of all sorts both good and bad both friends and foes or to infancy and childhood and so it signifieth adultus a growne man and so it is used cor

and so in the place cited phil


where the apostle acknowledging that he had not attained to perfection but still labouring to bee a good proficient exhorteth so many as are perfect to be of the same minde with him that is to strive towards perfection as having not yet attained to

the phrase is varied

there remaineth onely the answere of christ to the justitiary matth


if thou wilt bee perfect
which as have shewed before our saviour fitteth to the disposition of that justitiary whom having a great conceit of himselfe that he had kept all the commandements of god from his youth he thought good to discover and unmaske by a commandement of tryall
if thou wilt

saith hee bee perfect that is if thou wilt approve thy selfe to be a perfect observer of the law as thou pretendest goe and sell that thou hast and give to the poore and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow mee
for if thou refusest so to doe thou shalt bewray thy selfe to bee a meere wordling preferring the love of the world besore the love of god and desiring to retaine thy earthly wealth rather than to obtaine the heavenly treasure


xiii
his third sort of testimonies is of such as doe testifie that some have kept the commandements of god and namely those of loving with the whole heart and of not coveting
and to to this purpose he alleageth the examples of david of iosiah of asa and his people of iosuah and others whom hee doth but name of zachary and elizabeth of the apostles and namely of paul and in conclusion of ezechias and of abraham
answ
all these were sincere and upright keepers and observers of the law but none of them were perfect and perpetuall fulfillers of it none of them wre wthout sinne

david was a man according to gods owne heart in respect of his uprightnesse and integrity king


and for that and not for any absolute perfection he is commended in the places alleaged psal

king


act


king


and yet for all this david was a sinner and in many of his psalmes

bewayleth his manifold sinnes

desiring the lord not to enter

into judgement with him for if hee should neither he nor any other could be just in his sight placing his justification in the remission

of his sinnes and in gods acceptation of him imputing unto him righteousnesse without workes

iosias also was a godly and upright king but yet not without fault in that hee harkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god but presumptuously fought against him chron



of the people under asa no more can be gathered

but that with upright hearts and willing minds they entred into a covenant to seeke the lord in sincerity and truth
of asa himselfe the scripture indeed doth testifie

that his heart was perfect that is upright before the lord all his dayes
notwithstanding in the same place it is said that the high places were not taken away and in the next chapter three sinnes of his are recorded

that hee had relied on the king of syria and not on the lord that being reproved therefore by the prophet hanani he committed the prophet to prison that in his sickenesse he sought not to the lord but to the physitians

that which is said of

doth not concerne the observation of the morall law but those politicke precepts which the lord had given to moses and moses to iosuh concerning the utter destruction of the

canaanites whom the lord had delivered into his hands

of

zachary and elizabeth it is said first that they were just before god that is upright and secondly that they walked in all the commandements and ordinances of the lord blamelesse which latter they might doe and yet bee farre from that perfection which the law requireth
for paul professeth of himselfe that even before his conversion he was touching the righteousnes which is in the law blamelesse phil


they were blamelesse before men but not faultles before god
for zacharias did use to sacrifice for his owne sinnes as well as for others as augustine saith in his answere to this argument alleaged by the pelagians
and who knoweth not that for the sinne of incredulity hee was both deafe

and dumbe for a time

as touching the apostles before the resurrection of christ though our saviour call them his friends and giveth them this testimony that

they had kept his word yet who can bee ignorant how farre they were

at that time from perfection and with how great imperfections they kept his word

but it is strange that he should alleage the example of paul
rom
as one that had kept the commandement forbidding concupiscence when in that chapter hee doth not onely confesse that by that commandement

hee was convicted to bee a sinner in that hee had concupiscence but also that that habituall concupiscence might appeare exceedingly sinnefull it did take occasion by the law to worke in him all manner of actuall concupiscence


xiv
but bellarmines conceit is that concupiscence in the apostle

was no sinne because he did not consent to it
whereto answere first that as he was carnall

he did consent unto it but not as he was spirituall

for so hee saith delight in the law of god after the inward man

but see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
whereupon he cryeth out
wretched man that am who shall deliver me from the body of this death meaning therby the flesh or the body of sin
secondly though the apostle had not consented to concupiscence yet both the habituall concupiscence it self remainning in him after his regeneration and the actual concupiscences going before cosent· arising from thence were sins
the habituall is often called by the apostle a sin and is noted to be the sinning sin which taking occasion by the law to send forth evill concupiscences namely which the law forbiddeth was exceedingly sinfull
as for those undefined span alphabet or first motions of sinne in the thought or affections going before consent and arising from our owne concupiscence they are those very sinnes which are directly forbidden in the tenth commandement for those which are joyned

with consent are forbidden in the former commandements
neither could paul who had beene trayned up in the law bee ignorant of that which the very heathen knew by the light of nature that evill concupiscence accompanyed with consent was a sinne
but that which is forbidden in the tenth commandement the apostle had not knowne to bee a sinne except the law had said thou shalt not lust or thou shalt not have any evill concupiscence

hence bellarmine concludeth that because the law hath beene kept by many it is possible
neither doe we deny it to bee kept by the faithfull in respect of their upright walking in all the commandements of god but wee deny it to be perfectly fulfilled by them
their new obedience which they performe with upright hearts and willing mindes hath the title of perfection given unto it and is a perfection begunne in respect of the parts for even an infant that is formed in the wombe is perfect in respect of his parts and is accepted of god in christ the lord not imputing to the faithfull their imperfections
and it is a good saying of augustine

onia ergo mandata facta deputantur quando quicquid non fit ignoscitur
all the commandements are esteemed as done when that whch is not done is pardoned

xv
but this answere concerning perfection of obedience begunne

and the imperfections remitted will not serve the turne saith bllarmine
for he cannot absolutely be said to fulfill the law that sinneth in keping it
but the scripture saith of the fathers that not onely thy did absolutely keep the law but also that they kept it with their whole heat and with a perfect heart
yea zechias professth that he had walked before the lord in truth and with a perfect heart
and if ezechias walked before god with a perfct heart who will deny it to abraham to whom it was said

walke before me and be perfect
answ
wee doe read that the faithfull did keepe the law but wee never read that they did abolutely fulfill it but that all of them had their imperfections and their sinnes
and although many them abounded with good workes yet their justification consisted in the remission of their sinnes and gods acceptation of them in

christ imputing righteousnesse unto them without workes

and where as it is said that they obeyed god with their whole heart

and with a perfect heart this is to be understood of an entire or upright heart
the hebrew words tham thom tmin and shalem which signife perfect or perfection are synonyma or words of the same sence with ashar iosher and emeth that is upright uprightnesse and truth or sincerity and are signified by the phrase of walking with god or be fore god and ae the same with the greek words undefined span alphabet all of them opposed not to imperfection but to hypocrisie
for thom tham and thamin consider these places psal

where thom and iosher are used as synonima the latter being the exposition of the former
let perfection and preserve mee
iosh

where thamin and emth are used promiscuously serve the lord in perfection and in truth
psal

where tham and iashar are put for the same observe the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace
so iob is commended to have been ish th vejashar a perfect and upright man
the word shalem which in the same speech of ezechias king


is by the
translated undefined span alphabet perfect is by them redred esay

undefined span alphabet a true heart as an upright heart is called heb

the phrase not with an heart and an heart is expounded vers to be a perfect or upright heart

and to praise god with the whole heart psal



is to praie him with uprightnesse of heart psal


thus to walke with god or before god is to bee perfect or upright gen

and to bee perfect or upright is to walke with god or before him for to walke with god is for a man to behave himselfe as in his pesence· and to walke before god is to behave a mans selfe in his sight that is uprightly
thus hench gen


noh gen

abraham and isack gen

david and others are said to have walked before god
of david it is said that hee walked before god in truth and righteousnesse and uprightnesse of heart kin
of ezekias king


that hee walked before god in truth with a perfect that is an upright heart
for you are not so to understand it as if ezekias had no imperfections
for when the lord left him a little unto himselfe that he might try him and know that is make knowne unto him what was in his heart he rendred not againe according to the benefits done to him but hs heart was lifted up with pride chron


from this example of ezechias as it were from the lesse bellarmine inferreth
if ezechias walked before god with a perfect heart who will deny it to abraham to whom it was said walke before me and be perfct

answ
doubt not but abraham did walke before god· that is to say was perfect or upright
for so much the scriptures testifie of him gen





and that hee was the friend of god chr

esai

iam

but bellarmines proofe is very slender that abraham was such because hee was required so to be
for so the whole people of israel which for the uprightnesse required in them was called ieshrun deut



are exhorted deut

thou shalt be perfect that is upright with the lord thy god
ios

serve him in perfection and in truth
sam


in truth with all your heart
and thus it appeareth that the termes of perfect heart and whole heart in the places before mentioned doe not import any legall perfection but uprightnesse and integrity of hear which though it be but a perfection inchoated or begun being only a perfection in respect of the pars and not of the degrees towards which notwithstanding it aspireth· yet neverthelesse it is the evangelicall the christian and the best perfction which we can attaine unto this life


xvii
these were his proofes out of the scriptures
now

he will prve out of the fathers that the law of god is not impossible

he shold say for so he propounded the state of the question absolutely posble

but he fathers may be distinguished into two rankes
for either they we such as wrote before pelagius spred his errour or after
those whh wrote before did as

augustine saith write more carelesly of thee things insomuch that would seeme to father his errours up them
those who wrote after hee had broached his heresies as naely hierome in his latter dayes and augustine had the like controvere though not altogether the same with pelagius that we have with the apists
for both doe hold the same assertion that the law is possibl both doe use the like arguments and both doe abuse the same testonies of scripture to confirme their errour


xviii
there are confesse two seeming differences betweene

the pagians and the papists
the one that the plagians held that a man strength of nature might fulfill the commandements of god which papists deny
the other that a man might so fulfill the law of god as that he might live without si which the papists also deny
but if it considered that the pelagias did call the power of nature gods grac and did acknowledge that the direction and instruction which men hae by the word and law of god was to bee ascribed to gods grace ad that the grce of god doth helpe men more easily to obey the law god will appeare that there is no such great differenc in the foer respect as is pretendd

againe the betweene the pelagians and papists is not in respect of or impossibility but in respect of greater or lesse difficulty
for the papists do not aknowledge that men by natre are dead in sinne utterly deprived of the spirituall life but that they are sicke and weake and yed with the bands of sinne so that they cannot fulfill the law of god unlesse they olpen and loosed by

grace but being holpen by grace then the fulfilling of the commandements is easie to them
the pelagians likewise confesse that by the grace of god which they call bonum naturae or the power or possibility of nature they were enabled by the grace of god vouchsafed in his word and law guided and directed by the justifying grace of god freed from the bond of their sinnes and by the sanctifying grace of god holpen with more ease to fulfill the commandements of god
so that the papists although they doe not with the pelagians deny originall sinne or the necessity of saving grace yet they doe extenuate the originall corruption and so magnifie the strength of nature that they differ not much from them
for whereas originall corruption is both a privation of the habit of originall righteousnesse and also an evill and wicked disposition and pronenesse to all manner sinne infecting all the parts and faculties of the soule they make the rivation to be of the act onely and not of the habit or power as if it were not a meere impotencie to that which is spiritually good but a dfficulty the evill disposition either they altogether deny saying that iginall sinne is onely carentia justitiae debit ae in esse the want of originall ighteousnesse or else they so extenuate it that they make it to be lese than any veniall sinne and in the regenerate no sinne at all
but auustine doth truly teach against both pelagians and papists that man by nne lost both bonum possibilitatis and also possibilitatem non peccandi as vill hereafter

shew

and as touching the other difference though the papists hold at a man cannot bee altogether without sinne for any long time thoh for some short time in which short time if he shall say he hath no sine he shall make saint ion and not himselfe a lyar ioh

yet ey say they may be without all sines excepting those which they do all veniall which they doe so extenuate that indeed they make the no sinnes as being no anomies or transgressions of the law comtted against the law or repugnant to charity but onely besides the aw such as may well stand together with perfect inherent righteoesse
for they say he onely is a righteous man in whom there is no sie and yet that there is no man so righteous as that he liveth without ese veniall sinnes
but if they be and not contrary to the lw then they are neither commanded nor forbidden and so no sinnes all but undefined span alphabet things indifferent


xix
but let us examine his testimonies two whreof are scarce worth the examining the one out of

orign the othr out of cyrill and yet both of them so little to his purpo as theseeme to make against him rather than for him
orig compareth to women such men as say they are not able to observe certaine pepts of christ which the papists doe not call precepts but counèlls and therefore belong not at all as they teach but to those who would be thought to live in a state of perfection
besides which notorios hypocrites all in the church of rome are by this testimony to be ompared to women who not onely say they cannot but also thinke hey need not to observe

them as to sell all that a man hath and give it to the poore which indeed is neither a commandemen nor counsell given by christ unto all but a precept of tryall to that one wealthy justitiary

to him that striketh thee on the one cheeke turne to him the other also blesse him that curseth thee pray for him that persecuteth thee and such like which are indeed precepts given to all the faithfull and not counsailes directed onely to such as are or would seeme to be perfect

cyrill

saith hee affirmeth that the precept it self thou shalt not lust which is noted to be most difficlt may through grace be fulfilled
answ
that place of cyrill as it is translated into latine is in a maner without sence neither can any thing be soundly inferred from it
he seemeth to say that christ restoring mans nature to his originall perfection which is but begunne in this life said· to them of old it was said thou shalt not commit adultery but say unto you thou shalt not lust quamvis res sit ut pinor ad qum pertingi nequeat though it be a thing as suppose which cannot be attained unto namely in this life yet to this perfection christ hath reformed or restored us viz inchoative in this life and perfectly in the life to come


xx
the rest of the testimonyes are of wo sorts for either

they deny the commandements of god to be impossible as bsil orat in illud attende tibi deut

hiere dvers
pelag lib
in matth

de natura gratia cap
or else they affirme that they are possible if men would as cncil
arsican

can ult hilru in psalm

chrysstom in matth om
in hebr homil



answ
to preserve these fathers from contradicting themselves certaine distinctions are to be admitted
for the same men who dey the law to be impossible doe conesse

that god commandeth some things which wee cannot doe ad that never any since the fall of adam did or could fulfill the whole law of god and that there is no man that liveth without sinne
their meaning therfore is that although no man can fulfill the law yet it is not impossible
the first distinction is that which mentione before btwixt the perfect fulfilling and the upright keeping of gods commandments for although they cannot in this life be fulfilled in tht prfection which the law requireth yet they may and usually are kept of the faithfull in sincerity and uprightesse which the lord in the covenant of grace acceptech
the second is consering impossibility
for when it is said that the law is impossible to be fulfilled pctly it is either understood simply per se as the fathers understood it as it is impossible saith basil for the eye of a man to see his owne backe or conditionally and per accidens in respect of mans condition or estate
for the law was possible to man in his integrity when he was in the earth by paradise before his fall and shall be possible againe when hee shall be fully renewed in the heavenly paradise
but to man being fallen into the state of disobedience the fulfilling of the law is impossible by

accident
for

undefined span alphabet the fleshly disposition of our corrupt nature is not subject to the law of god neither can it be
the third distinction is in respect of the persons for men are either undefined span alphabet unregenerate or undefined span alphabet regenerate
the regenerate man by the grace of god is both willing and able to keepe the law according to the measure of grace received
the unregenerate man is not able to keepe the law because hee will not the very frame of his will being enmity against god
rom

gen



and here it is to be observed that those fathers which had to doe with the pelagians who held that men by strength of nature were able to fulfill the law of god or else the lord commandiug them unpossible things should be unjust neither should the fault be in men who cannot obey but in god who enjoyneth impossible things did grant unto them that god did not command impossibilityes yet they did hold which the papists also confesse that no man without grace could performe them
for indeed to an unregenerate man who is dead in sinne it is as unpossile to fulfill the wole law of god which is spirituall as it is for a dead man to perfrme the actions of the naturall life
for as said before out of augustine

man by his sinne hath lost not onely bonum possibilitatis so that ee can doe no good but also

possibilitatem non peccandi so that hee cannot but sinne though hee sinne most freely
for this is the freedome of a man not regenerate quâ potest peccare non potest non peccare dam nabiliur saith the master

of the sentences whereby hee is able to sinne and can doe no other but sinne and that damnably


xxi
and further to those testimonies which affirme that

men may fulfill the commandements if they will answeare that nothing can be inferred from thence ulesse it be proved that men at all times are willing to fulfill them
for if they be not willing they are not able and much lesse doe they actually performe them
thus therefore they must argue

to them that are allwaies willing to keepe the commandements the law is not impossible
but all men are alwaies willing to keepe the commandements therefore to no man is the law impossible
the proposition is not generally true in respect of the regenerate themselves unto whom to will is oftentimes present when how to performe that which is good they find not rm

for the good that they would they doe not and the evill which they would not that they doe

but the assumption is manifestly false and the contrary is generally true
no man is allwaies willing
and therefore from those testimonyes wherein the condition of the will is interposed nothing can be concluded for the absolute possibility of fulfilling the law but rather against it
for those who are not at all times so willing as they ought to be to fulfill the law they cannot allwaies fulfill it
but no man is at all times so willing as he ought to be to fullfill the law

augustine

averreth nminem esse qui tantum velit res exigit therfore no man is able allwaies to fulfill it
for although perhaps he could if hee would which as even now said is not generally true of the regenerate themselves yet whiles hee will not hee cannot
for the will of obeying is the chiefe part of obedience
the meaning therfore of those fathers is that the impossibility of the law is not to be ascribed to the law as if it were not possible but to the will of man who will not obey it

xxii
now that the fathers who deny the law to be impossible

doe not meane that it is absolutely possible to be perfectly fulfilled appeareth by these reasons
first because they yeelded so farre to the objection of the pelagians as not to deny it to be possible to the unregenerate as noted before
secondly because they held that all men are sinners and that no man in this mortall life can live without sinne and consequently without transgressing the law
now it is manifest that hee who transgresseth th law doth not fulfill it
but when we thus argue bellarmine saith we confound two questions which ought not to be confounded whether the commandements may be kept and whether a man may live without sinne· which questions are so different that to the former gustine allwayes answered affirmatively to which purpose ee citeth
peccat merit
remiss lib
cap


de ntur gratia
de gratia lib arbitr
in psal
and to the latter negatively to which purpose hee quoteth lib de natur gratia cap

de spiritu litera cap ult contr

epistolas pelag
epist


and the whole booke de perfectione justiti

asw
this say is a plaine evidence that augustine when hee saith which wee also say that a man may keepe the commandements meaneth not the perfect fulfilling of the law
for if the question be propounded concerning the perfect fulfilling of the law it is the same in effect with the other
for hee that perfectly fulfilleth the law doth undoubtedly live without nne and hee that doth not live without sinne doth not perfectly fulfill the law
wherefore the affirmation of the one question understood of perfect fulfilling and the negation of the other doth imply a contradiction

thirdly because the fathers explane their meaning when they say that the law is possible and that a man may keepe the commandements not in respect of the perfect fulfilling but partly in respect of the sincee study and upright endevour to performe and partly in respect of gods mercie in christ pardoning what is wanting in their obedience
so saith augustine

hîc studium pracepta servandi gratia dei tribuit qu si quid etiam in eis prceptis minus servtur ignoscit
here the grace of god bestoweth the study of keeping the precepts which also if any thing in those precepts be not kept it pardoneth which cited before

all the commandements are reputed to be done when whatsoever is not done is pardoned and elsewhere hee saith

that our righteousesse in this life doth consist rather in remission of sins than in perfection of virtues
for as touching perfection he saith

vrtutem quae nu est in homine justo perfectam hactenus nominare ut ad ejus perfectionem pertineat etiam ipsius imperfectionis in veritate agnitio in humilitate confessio· that the virtue which now is in a just man is farre forth called perfect that to the perfection thereof appertaineth both the acknowledgment of the imperfection there of in truth and the confssion of it in humilily


xxiii
but hee bellarmine holdeth a strange paraoxe
that although a man cannot live without sin yet he may perfectly fulfill the

law of god
the absurdity whereof hee hopeth to salve with the distinction of sinnes into veniall and mortall because veniall sinnes without which none are in this life doe not hinder the fulfilling of the law
but this distinction will not serve his turne unlesse hee can prove that veniall sinnes are no sinnes
for if they be sinnes they are transgressions of the law
and if they be transgessions of the law as undoubtedly thy are or else they

be no sinnes then hee that cannot live witout them cannot live without transgression of the law and hee tht cannot live without transgression of the law cannot perfectly fulfill it
will not enter into the full discussing of this question at this time because it is another controversy onely for the clearing of the point in hand doe avouch according to the sriptures that the wages of sinne or stipend rom

the undefined span alphabet the just recompence of reward heb

is death and that the least sinne according to the sentence of the law if it be a sinne maketh a man subjct to the curse of god gal


and that as every sinne deserveth death and therefore in it self is mortall so every sinne is punishd with death either with the death of the party who hath no part in christ to whom all sinnes are mortall or with the death of christ as the sinnes of those who are his members to whom their sinnes which in their owne nature are mortall become veniall as being allready punished in christ and the justice of god satisfied for them by the satisfaction given by christ whose bloud doth cleanse us

from all our sinnes both great and small none being so small but that it is of sufficient weight to presse down the sinner to hell being of infinit guilt committed against infinite justice deserving infinite punishment for which the justice of god cannot be satisfyed but by a propitiation of infinite value
thus therefore reason
that sinn which is punished with the death of christ is in it selfe mortall all and every even he least sinne of the faithfull is punished with the death of christ therfore all and every even the least sinne of the faithfull is in it selfe mortall

but bellarmine hath a conceipt

that veniall sinnes are not simply sines nor against the law but besides it
answere
first that which is besides the law is an aberration from it and a declination from it ither to the right hand or to the left and that is undefined span alphabet]· and is

absolutely forbidden
secondly to doe that which is besides the

law is not to doe that which is commanded but hee that doth not the thing commanded that doth not all that doth not continue in doing all is subject to the curse
thirdly whatsoever is not agreeable or conformable to the law is undefined span alphabet that is a sinne
but that which is besides the law is not conformable unto it therefore it is a sinne and a transgression of the law which whosoever committeth hee doth not fulfill the law

fourthly things forbidden in the law are against the law
those which they call veniall sinnes are forbidden in the law
for either they are forbidden or commanded or neither forbidden nor commanded
if they be commanded then are they duetyes and not sinners if neither commanded nor forbidden then are they undefined span alphabet things indifferent it remayneth therefore that they are forbidden


xxiv
now because the proofe of this point that the fulfilling

of the law is not possible unto us is a matter of great consequence for thereby the popish doctrine of justification by inherent righteousnesse in generall and by workes in particular is evidently confuted will to those arguments heretofore

used adde the testimonies of antiquity in requitall of bellarmines allegations out of the fathers

first therefore iustin martyr

saith that never any man did accurately performe all the things that are commanded
undefined span alphabet

secondly eusebius caesariensis demonstrates

that things required in undefined span alphabet to all men impossible

thirdly ambrose

tanta mandata sunt ut impossibile sit servari ea so great things are commanded that it is impossible they should be kept whence peter in the acts of the apostles saith why doe you impose a yoke upon the brethren which neither our fathers nor we were able to beare

fourthly chrysostome

what did the law intend to make a man just but it was not able undefined span alphabet for no man did fulfill it


no man

could be justified by the law unlesse hee fulfilled all undefined span alphabet but this was not possible to any man therfore that righteousnesse it self is quashit


that the apostle

by testimony cited out of deut proveth undefined span alphabet that no man hath fulfilled the law

hierome and augustine in this point deliver the same things against the pelagians which wee doe against the papists

fifthly quoniam a saith hierome

nemo potest implere legem that no man can fulfill the law and doe all things that are commanded the apostle testifieth also elsewhere
for that which was impossible of the law in that it was weake through the flesh rom




this is the onely perfection of men

if they know themselves to be unperfect
and you saith hee when you have done all say wee are unprofitable servants wee have done what was our duety to

doe
if hee be unprofitable who hath done all what is to be said of him who was not able to fulfill


and againe thou saist the commandements of god are easie tamen nullum proferre potes qui universa compleverit and yet canst bring forth none that hath fulfilled them all


god

saith the pelagian hath given possible commandements and who denyeth this but how this sentence is to bee understood the vessell of election most plainely teacheth that which was impossible of the law in that it was weak through the flesh c· that is that the law is not simply impossible but by reason of the flesh that which was possible before the fall is since the fall impossible by reason of mans coruption


when

the pelagians said that although no man bee without sinne yet he might be without sinne what kinde of arguing saith he is this posse esse quod nunquam fuerit that that may be which never was posse fieri quod nullum fecisse testeris that that may be done which your selfe testifie never any man did and to attribute that know not to whom which you can never prove to have beene in the patriarches or prophets or apostles


that

which our saviour christ saith if thou wilt be perfect is said to him who could not yea would not and therefore could not


then

are we just when we confesse our selves to be sinners and our righteousnesse consisteth not of our owne merit but of gods mercie


if

wee doe not that which we would but worke that which wee would not how say ye that a man may be without sinne if he will behold the apostle and all beleevers are not able to accomplish what they would


having cited many testimonies to prove that no man is justified by the workes of the law all these saith he

runne through ut ostendam a nullo legem esse imletam that might shew that the law is fulfilled of none meaning by the law all the commandements which are contained in the law


if you

can shew the man who hath fulfilled all then may you shew a man who needeth not gods mercie


the

law is made weake quoniam nemo potest iplere eam nisi dominus because none but our lord can fulfill it

vi augustine

saith that to that immortall life appertaineth that precept thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soule and with all thy might but to this life let not sinne reigne in your mortall bodies to obey the lusts thereof to that life thou shalt not lust to this thou shalt not goe after thy lusts


god doth

so worke righteousnesse in his saints labouring under the temptation of this life that notwithstanding there remaineth both what he may largely adde to them when they aske and also what he may mercifully forgive when they confesse


in the same chapter hee had said that the two commandements

of loving god with all our heart and our neighbours as our selves wee shall fulfill when we shall see face to face
but saith he the same is now commanded us ut admoneremur quid fide exposcere quò spem praemittere ut oblivisendo quaeretro sunt in quae anterira nos extendere debeamus that wee might be admonished what by faith to desire whether to send before our hope unto what things which are before we should preasse forward forgetting what is behind


that the virtue

which now is in a just man is so farre to be called perfect that to the perfection thereof there belongeth the acknowledgment of its imperfection in verity and the confession thereof in humility for then this petite justice is according to its small measure infirmely perfect when it understandeth what is wanting to it selfe
and therefore the apostle saith both that he is unperfect and that hee is perfect unperfect considering how much he wanted unto justice the fulnesse whereof he did as yet hunger after and thirst perfect both because he is not ashaed to confesse his imperfections and goeth forward well that he may attaine unto it


surely hee that is renewed from day to day

which is the cause of the most regenerate is

not yet wholly renewed and how much he is not yet renewed so much he is in his old estate


it is

the fulnesse of virtue which the law saith thou shalt not covet hoc modò impleri non potest this now cannot bee fulfilled


so long

as love may and ought to bee increased as in this life alwayes it may and ought certainely that which is lesse than it ought to be is faulty by reason of which faultinesse there is not a just man upon the earth that doth good and sinneth not
by reason of which faultinesse no man living shall be justified in gods sight

sedulius

upon those words for christ is the end of the law that is saith he perfectionem legis habet qui credit in christ hee hath the perfection of the law who beleeveth in christ
for seeing no man was justified by the law quia nemo impleat legem because none did fulfill the law

oecumenius

for this cause they who adhere to the law are accursed undefined span alphabet because they are not able to fulfill the law

ix bernard

neither was the ignorant that the weight of the commandement did exceed the strength of men but hee judged it profitable that by this meanes they might bee admonished of their insufficiencie and that they might know unto what end or perfection of righteousnesse they ought according to their ability strive wherfore mandando impossibilia by commanding things impossible hee made not men transgressours but humble


therefore

he hath straightly comanded his commandements to be kept that seeing our imperfection to be defective non posse implere quod dbet that it cannot fulfill what it ought we might flee to mercie

thomas aquinas

on those words gal


for it is written

cursed he proveth saith hee his purpose viz that no man can be justified by the workes of the law quia nullus potest servare legem because no man can keepe the law in that manner that the law prescribeth deut
because every one is accursed who doth not continue in all things which ar written in the booke of the law to doe them that is who doth not fulfill the whole law
sed implere totam legem est impossibile but to fulfill the whole law it is impossible

xi cardinall csanus

nemo vunquam adimplevit legem never any man fulfilled the law which consisteth in love but christ only who came not to breake the law but to fulfill it

against all these the sacred councell of trent

denounceth anathema

cap vii

bellarmines sixe reasons to prove that the law of god is absolutely possible answered and refuted




now come to bellarmines reasons which are in

number sixe
the first a man may doe more than is commanded therefore much more hee is able to fulfill the commandement
the antecedent hee proveth by three testimonies
the first of christ matth

who after he had said if thou wilt enter into life keepe the commandements and the party had answered all these have kept from my youth he saith unto him againe

if thou wilt be perfect goe and sell all that thou hast
the second of chrysostome who saith

that many exceed the commandements
the third of augustine

who saith no great burden is imposed upon virgins greater love hath imposed a greater weight
as if they should say what dost thou command that we should not bee adultresses is this that which thou commandest in love to thee we doe more than thou commandest

answere by distinction
for when he saith a man may doe more than is commanded that more may be understood either extensivè to things not commanded at all or intesivè in respect of things commanded but done in greater perfection than is commanded
and thus he meaneth either some speciall commandement or the whole law
if he meane the whole law deny the antecedent
for have proved that no mortall man is able to fulfill the whole law and much lesse to doe more
the law of god is a perfect rule of righteousnesse unto which nothing can or ought

to bee added
and to him that goeth about to adde to gods law god will adde

his judgements because

hee addeth nothing but and sinne
and to such it will be said who required these things at your hands neither is that obedience to god which god hath not required
and this is the case of all the religious orders among the papists who professe greater perfection than god hath required the severall religions being so many misleading them from that way which leadeth to heaven
and this overthroweth all their superarrogant workes of supererogation
for there can bee no workes of supererogation over and above the law unlesse first the whole law be fulfilled and then more bee added thereunto
neither of which can bee done
if hee meane either things not commanded or the duties of any one speciall commandement then deny the consequence
for as touching things not commanded it is manifest that they who are addicted to doe many things not commanded who notwithstanding neglect the things commanded making the commandements of god of none effect

through their traditions
and this is the condition of all popish votarles who though they should fully observe the rules of their severall orders yet would bee very farre from fulfilling the whole law of god
if hee meane some speciall commandement as by his proofes it seemeth hee doth then also deny the consequence
for though man should doe more than is required in some speciall commandement yet hee would bee defective in respect of others and hee that faileth in any is guilty of all


ii
but suppose it would be hard for any papist to shew that

in respect of any necessary morall duety more can bee laudably performed than is by duety required
for whatsoever can be done it is either commanded of god or forbidden or neither commanded nor forbidden
if it be forbidden it is evill and not to be done
if it bee commanded it cannot bee done in greater perfection than god in his law doth require it to be done
if it be neither commanded nor forbidden then it is in it owne nature indierent and therefore in respect of our christian liberty free either to bee done or to be left undone
but because our liberty is not a loose licentiousnesse but a true liberty bounded with the lawes of piety and charity therefore we are so to use or forbeare the use of these things as that therein wee doe not offend against either piety or charity
if therefore wee shall use these things as meanes or helpes to performe the dueties either of piety or charity or refuse them as impediments to either having either in the using or refusing respect to the glory of god to the good of our selves or of our brethren wee shall doe more than is commanded in respect of the particular thing it selfe which is simply neither commanded nor forbidden· but not more in respect of the generall lawes of piety and charity· which as they command us to love god with all our soules and our neighbour as our selves and forbid the contrary vices so they command all the meanes and helpes which may bee used for the pformance of these

duties of piety and charity and forbid both all impediments of the dueties commanded and also all provocations to the evils forbidden
now in these things which are neither simply commanded nor forbidden counsels have place either for the using or refusing of them as shall bee most for gods glory the benefit of our brethren and our owne spirituall good which counsels as it is a vertue to obey so to disobey them is a sinne and consequently the observer of them doth no more than hee ought to doe
and therefore the papists whiles they enjoyne the observation of the counsels onely to them who would seeme to live in a state of perfection they teach all others to sinne by disobeying them as not being tyed to the observation of them
as for example not to sweare in ordinary communication not to revenge nor to resist evill to blesse them that curse us to pray for them that persecute us and many such like among which they reckon the eigth beatitudes matth



in which a good part of the power of religion consisteth
so that to sweare ordinarily in common talke to seeke private revenge and such like are no sinnes with the papists


iii
but let us come to his proofes
the first whereof is mat



if thou wilt bee perfect goe and sell all that thou hast upon which place they ground their counsell of voluntary poverty
but it is evident by that which before have said that this was not a precept or counsell given to all that would aspire towards perfection which is the duety and property of all true christians but a precept of triall directed in speciall to that rich iustitiary to discover unto him his owne imperfection
or if it had been but a counsell according to the popish coruction given to one that had already fulfilled all the commaements which no man can bee said to have fulfilled untill he ave fulfilled his course then had it been no sinne for him not to obey this counsell nor any hinderance to his salvation
for having fulfilled all the commandements as the papists conceive of him he might enter into life though he did not this which here hee is advised unto
but he sinned in disobeying this precept of triall which if he had obeyed hee had done no more than in duety he was bound to doe having received a speciall commandement to that purpose
neither had hee fulfilled those commandements which hee saith hee had kept from his youth otherwise than according to the interpretation of the scribes and pharisees and consequently according to their righteousnesse which whosoever doth not

exceed shall not enter into the kingdome of heaven and much lesse had he fulfilled all the commandements of god
for by disobeying this commandement of christ he plainely bewrayed himselfe to be a transgressour of the first and last commandements yea that he did not truely affect and prize his owne salvation but being a meere worldling preferred the love of his pelfe to the love of god and desired rather to enjoy his worldly wealth for a short time than to obtaine and for ever to enjoy the heavenly treasures which christ

promised him if hee would follow him
and for this his sinne in disobeying christ his entrance into heaven was hindered
insomuch that of him and all such as he was our saviour giveth this

censure that it is easier for a camell to goe through the eye of a needle than for a rich man that setteth his heart upon riches as this man did to enter into the kingdome of god


iv
as for their counsell and vow of voluntary poverty

though will not insist thereupon it being another controversie yet thus much briefly will say
first that it hath no ground in the scriptures and therefore being obtruded as a matter of religion it is meere which is neither acceptable to god nor availeable to themselves
secondly as it is practised among the papists it is nothing worth being done neither out of the love of god nor of their neighbour but out of a pharisaicall conceit· by their works of supererogation to make god their debtour
for as the apostle saith if should bestow all my goods to eed the poore and have not charity it would profit me nothing
cor

thirdly it is repugnant to the scriptures and namely to the eigth the fifth and second commandement
in the eigth commandement as could shew there is required a moderate desire of temporall blessings avoiding the contrary extremes of coveing too much or of affecting voluntary poverty
and accordingly wee are to frame our prayers and our practice
our prayer as our saviour

hath taught us to begge of god undefined span alphabet that is that portion of temporall blessings which god in his wisedome doth know to bee expedient for us that is as agur prayeth prov
give mee neither poverty or beggary as the latine rendreth it nor riches feed mee with food convenient for me
where lechem chqqi is the very same with undefined span alphabet
our practice not to live idlely upon the sweat of other mens browes as friars mendicants and other lusty beggars doe but every mans duety is to worke with his hands the thing that is

good that is to earne his living by the lawfull workes of his lawfull calling not onely that hee may eate his owne bread which our saviour teacheth us to begge of god and the apostle to labour for that we may eat our owne bread thes

and the psalmist promiseth as a blessing to him that feareth god psal

for thou shalt eat the labour of thine owne hands but also that hee may have to give to others ephes


therefore the apostle act


exhorteth the faithfull by labouring in their lawfull callings to support the impotent and to remember the words of our lord iesus for though the papists esteeme them to live in a state of perfection who live in voluntary beggary yet our saviour was wont to say it is a more blessed thing to give than to receive
and therefore a more blessed estate it is to be able to give than to live upon the almes of others

the fifth commandement teacheth us to honour our private and our publike parents in the church and common wealth and the common mother of us all that is our country all which we are to

honour with our service and with our goods as occasion is offered and need requireth and not to behave our selves as if we were borne for our selves alone neglecting others whom we ought to honour
and therfore by this their counsell the papists teach men especially when they take young men or women into their cloisters against the liking of their parents to breake the commandement of god as the

pharisees did
neither can they truely say that they helpe others with their devotion

for their devotions· are superstitious and idolatrous or if they were good they needed not to goe into a cloister to performe them which might and ought to be afforded in a lawfull calling

the second commandement under that one kind of making to our

selves images forbiddeth willworship aud all devised meanes of gods worship

according to the doctrine and inventions of men as all the religions of those manifold orders among the papists are willworship and superstition
and under that one kind of worshipping of images or of god by them he condemneth all false and counterfeit worship and namely hypocrisie but the seeming poverty of popish votaries is hypocriticall
for under the profession of voluntary poverty they live in all ease and aboundance
for although the severall monks and fryers professe that they have nothing in their owne proper possession yet they are rich in the common possessions of their monastaries which being many times very large are imployed for the maintenance of them
so that a carnal man who maketh no conscience of living incontinently in single life and maketh account that he was borne for himself alone hath reason to choose this monasticall life above all others as most likely to give contentment to his idle and crnall disposition
now then to obtrude this vowed poverty which as it hath no ground in the scriptures so it is repugnant therunto in so many respects as a matter not only of religion but also of satisfaction both for themselves and others of merit of perfection of supererogation is a thing to bee detested as most wicked and antichristian



as for his other testimonies it is plaine that chrysostome

and augustine speake but of that one commandement which forbiddeth adultery
but though a man were able to doe more than that one commandement requireth yet it would not follow that hee were therefore able to doe more than the whole law requireth
but indeed in respect of that one commandement more cannot bee done lawfully than that commandement prescribeth or if more should be done it would not be done in obedience to that commandement
indeed if you respect onely the outward letter of that commandement as the fathers did it being a prohibition of the externall act of adultery it cannot be denyed but that all who are not adulterers have fulfilled that commandement
but if these two things be considered first that the law is

spirituall and therefore forbiddeth not onely the outward act of adultery but all uncleannenesse whatsoever in thoght in word and indeed insomuch that he who looketh

on a woman to ust after her hath broken this commandement

and secondly that this commandement as all the rest hath two parts the negative forbidding all uncleannenesse the affirmative commanding all

chastity both outward and also inward which is the purity or cleannenesse of the soule from all the lusts of the flesh it must be granted that nothing can bee added to the perfection of chastity which this commandement prescribeth yea but the chastity in single life is more than is commanded
for the law forbiddeth women to be adulteresses but they that follow this cousell vw perpetuall virginity which is more as saint augustine saith
it is more than the letter of the negative forbidding onely the outward act of adultery doth require but not more than the affirmative being spiritually understood doth prescribe
which is to observe chastity in that condition wherein wee live whether it be in single life or in marriage
indeed no where is it simply either commanded or forbidden to live either in single life or in wedlocke it being in its owne nature a thing indifferent
but chastity in both is absolutely required
for there is a chastity of wedlocke as well as of single life though the papists most wickedly oppose wedlocke to chastity
chastity say is simply commanded to all as an especiall ornament of the soule from whence it hath its

name being the purity and cleanenesse of the soule from all unlawfull lusts
but single life or mariage are not simply either commanded or forbidden but to certaine persons
for to them who have not the gift of continencie which all have not neither are all capable of for so much is signified in the verbe undefined span alphabet matth


but onely they to whom it is given to them marriage is commanded as an holy ordinance of god and as an holy remedy against lust and to them being not able to containe continuance in single life is forbidden
for the avoiding of fornication and all uncleannesse every man

that hath not the gift of continencie is commanded to have his wife and every woman that hath not the gift of continencie is commanded to have her husband
of them who have the gift of continencie some are not fit for procreation but are impotent from their mothers wombe math

to these marriage is forbidden
others are not unfit for procreation and to those whiles they have the gift of continencie which in very few who are fit for procreation is perpetuall they are neither commanded to marry nor to live single but as they finde it to be expedient for them
and that estate which they finde most expedient for the glory of god and their owne good they are to choose
and if they make choice of single life in love to god whom they cannot love sufficiently
and to their owne soules uto which they ought not to bee wanting making themselves unuches for the kingdome of god matth


they in their choice do no more than they ought to doe they being bound by the law to that perfection of chastity which no man in this life can attaine unto
for besides the externall there are two degres of inward chastity the one is a purity and cleanenesse of the soule not only from all passions but also motions of lust which are called undefined span alphabet and this is

pure and perfect chastity which we cannot attaine unto whiles wee are infected whith originall or habituall concupiscence the other is called continencie which is a virtue restrayning and repressing the concupiscences of the flesh which

warre against our soules maintaining a continuall warfare against them
to this those who have the gift of continencie in some measure attaine but notwithstanding come farre short of that purity which the law of god requireth


vi
as for the vowed chastity among the papists it is so

farre from being a state of perfection or supererogation as that it is for the most part a sinnefull state and that in three respects
first in respect of making the vow
for it is sinne to vow that which a man doth not know to be lawfull or not in his owne power then doth hee sinne with an high hand not onely resolving but also vowing to sinne and to continue therein
secondly in respect of the performing the vow when the thing vowed viz continencie in single life doth appeare not to be in their power and yet to performe their vow of single life live in incontinency and uncleanenesse
many times it falleth out that a man at the first doth not know the thing vowed to be either not lawfull or not in his power yet because he doth not know it to be lawfull and in his power he sinneth by rash vowing but when afterwards it doth appeare to be either unlawfull or not in his power he is not bound to keepe that vow which rashly he made but hee is bound to breake it for by performing it he addeth sinne to sinne and many times a greater sinne to a lesse that is to the rashnesse of his vow the incontinencie of his life
and this is perpetuall among the popish votaries who never dissolve their vow though the performance of it bee never so wicked
thirdly because the vowed single life among the papists being for the most part so filthy and abominable that all the world cryeth shame upon them for their filthinesse yet by them is obtruded unto god as a matter not onely of religion and satisfaction but also of merit of perfection and supererogation

and the like might be said of their vow of blinde obedience
for simple and absolute obedience is onely to bee vowed and performed to god
but to vow the like towards any sinfull man who either doth or at least may command that which is unlawfull as sometimes they doe to murther princes or to attempt other traiterous practises and to thinke that in so doing he doth merit and supererogate it is to forsake god


vii
his second reason if the commandements were impossible they would binde no man
and so the precepts should bee no precepts for

it cannot bee imagined how any man should sinne in that which hee cannot avoid

his reason is thus to be framed to that which is impossible no man is tyed to the commandements all men are tyed therefore the commandements are not impossible

the assumption which no man denyeth he proveth because if they did not binde they were no precepts neither were the transgression of them a sinne

the proposition he proveth because it cannot bee imagined how a man should sinne in that which he cannot avoid
answere as heretofore by distinction
that the commandements are said to be impossible either simply or by accident
if therefore the meaning of his conclusion be that the commandements bee not simply and absolutely impossible then grant all for wee never held that the commandements are simply impossible for to man both before his fall and after his resurrection they were and shall be absolutely possible
but since the fall they are impossible in respect of the perfect performance in and by our selves not simply but by reason of the flesh that is to say through our owne default
for if wee would not have sinned in adam the law had beene possible unto us but by our voluntary sinne we lost both possibilitatis and also possibilitatem non peccand
now it were absurd to imagine that our fault should free us from obedience
howbeit even after the fall there is a distinction to be held betweene men unregenerate in the corrupt state of nature and the regenerate in the state of grace
to the unregenerate the law is impossible through their owne default which doth not lessen their sinne for they sinne voluntarily and many times of malice as the devils also doe who though they have brought upon themseles a necessity of sinning so that they can doe no other but sinne yet this doth not as said extenuate their sinne for they commit sinne with greedinesse but rather aggravate their finfulnesse
those that are habituated in sinne in whom custome is become as it were another nature they can no more of themselves ceasse from sinning than a can wash away his blackenesse ier



viii
yea but saith bellarmine it cannot bee imagined how a

man should sinne in that which hee cannot avoid
answ
that seemeth to be true in respect of the liberty of contradiction but not in respect of the liberty of contrariety
in respect of a sinfull action a man hath liberty to doe it or not to doe it which wee call the liberty of contradiction
but he hath not liberty to doe that which is good his naturall will enabling him onely to sinne
so that although a naturall man may abstaine from this or that sinfull act yet he sinneth in whatsoever he doth neither can he doe any other but sinne
if therefore they doe not sin who are not able to fulfill the law then all infidels yea all naturall men who cn doe nothing but sinne should be exempted from sinning which is absurd
to the regenerate man as said before the law is possible both in respect of his faith
for he that truely beleeveth in christ hath fulfilled the law in christ
secondly in regard of his new obedience and that in three respects
for first his new obedience though it be not compleat yet it is obedientia inchoata and though it be not a fulfilling of the law yet it is an acceptable keeping thereof
secondly though it be unperfect and stayned with the flesh yet being ntyre that is sincere

and upright it is in christ accepted as perfect
thirdly because the imperfection thereof being covered with christs perfect obedience and cured by his intercession is remitted
now all is esteemed done when that which is not done is remitted


ix
his third reason if god should command things impossible he

should be more cruell horresco referens and more foolish than any tyrant in exacting atribute from his owne friends which none were able to pay and making such lawes which he knew none were able to performe
but the consequent is blasphemous therefore the antecedent
to the proposition answere as before by distinction
that if god should command things simply impossible there would besome colour for his blasphemous consequence
but the lord commandeth nothing but what to man in his first creation was absolutely possible neither doth he exact any tribute which he did not make us able to pay nor make any law which we were not able to observe
and although now wee cannot in our selves fulfill it yet god was not tyed to accommodate his law like a lesbian rule to our weakenesse contracted by our owne default but it became him to propound such lawes as were answerable to our first integrity describing what we were and not what we are that seeing from what wee are fallen we might seeke to bee repaired in christ who is the end of the law for righteousnesse to every one that beleeveth rom

the covenant of workes god made with man in his state of integrity when he was able to keepe it
but after the fall because it was not possible that man should performe that covenant in and by himselfe he in great mercie made with man the covenant of grace in christ
but lest any man should either through ignorance or pride neglect the benefit of the messias it pleased god to renew the covenant of workes not to that end that men should be justified or saved thereby but that it might bee a meanes to drive them unto christ
and fo bellarmine himselfe hath taught

lex non data erat ut justificaret sed ut morbum stenderet ad quaerndum medicum excitaret
the law was not given to that end that it should justifie but that it might shew the disease and stirte up men to seeke to the physitian

againe a distinction is to be made as in the answere to the second reason of the parties to whom the law is given
for to the wicked and reprobate who are gods rebellious subjects the law is indeed impossible through their owne default and yet god exacteth most justly that righteousnesse in which hee did create them hee requireth most justly an accompt of those talents which hee committed to them though now they be not able to pay
the debt is duely exacted of the debtour though through his own default hee bee not now able to make payment
as for the elect whom the lord hath before they were loved in christ hee hath given his law to them not to this end that either by the observation thereof in their own persons they should bee justified or by the breach thereof they should bee condemned for then who could be saved but the use of the law to them before their conversion is that it might bee unto

them a schoolmaster unto christ and after their conversion and justification it might bee a rule whereby to frame their lives and conversation aspiring alwaies towards that perfection which the law prescribeth though they cannot fully attaine unto it
why then saith augustine

should not this perfection bee enjoyned to man though no man in this life have it non enim rectè curratur si quò currendum est nesciatur quomodo autem sciretur si nullis praeceptis ostenderetur
for men cannot runne well if they know not whither they must runne and how should they know that if by precepts it be not made known to them and worthy is that saying of bernard

to be repeated againe and againe
neither was the commander ignorant that the weight of the commandement doth exceed the strength of men but hee judged it profitable that hereby they should be admonished of their owne unsufficiencie and that they might know to what end or perfection of righteousnesse they should aspire
therefore by commanding impossible things hee did not make men transgressors but humble that every mouth may bee stoppod

and the whole world made obnoxious to god
for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified in his sight
for receiving the commandement and feeling our defectivenes wee shall cry to heaven and god will have mercie on us
and wee shall know in that day that not by the workes of righteousnesse

which wee have done but according to his mercie hee hath saved us



his fourth reason is collected out of three places of scripture
rom

mat

heb

in the first it is said that christ suffered that the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us
in the second we are taught to pray that gods will may bee done upon earth as it is in heaven
in the third that christ is made to all that obey him the cause of eternall salvation
but saith hee if we cant fulfill the law then christ misseth of his end
for notwithstanding his sufferings the justification of the law is not fulfilled in us neither is our prayer ever obtayned of fulfilling gds will and commandements on earth as in heaven neither is christ the authour of salvation to any because none obey him

answ
as touching the first place because it is often alleaged by bellarmine will somewhat insist upon it
the place is two wayes expounded either of sanctification or of justification
ifit be to be understood of sanctification as the papists commonly expound it we acknowledge that our sanctification is the end and fruit of our redemption by christ and that this end is atchieved all those who live not after the flesh but after the spirit that is in all true believers
say it is archieved in this life and perfectly in the life to come
but as suppose it is rather to be understood of justification
for the apostle having assured the faithfull vers
that notwithstanding sinne and the body of sinne and of death wherof hee had complayned chap
remayneth in them yet forasmuch as we are delivered from the same by iesus christ our lord vers
there is no condemnation to them which are in christ as his members

whom hee describeth by this character that they walke not after the flesh but after the spirit in the verses following he confirmeth the same conclusion showing how christ hath delivered us
for saith hee vers
the law of the spirit of life in christ iesus hath delivered me from the law of sinne and of death
whereby the law of the spirit of life we understand the virtue and power of holynes or sanctification not in us but in christ iesus for so hee saith though they doe not observe it who understand this place of sanctification and righteousnesse inherent who by his righteousnesse and merits hath delivered us from the power of sinne and of death
but the apostle as in the former chapter vers
so here in the singular number speaketh of himself teaching by his owne example every true christian to apply the benefits of christ to himself
for that which was impossible for the law to doe that is to justifie us in that it was weake through the flesh god sending his owne sonne in the likenes of sinfull flesh that is in the humane nature subject to passions and infirmities and that for sinne that hee might take away the sinne of the world for so saith

undefined span alphabet condemned sinne in the flesh that is exacted the due punishment of sinne in his humane nature that the guilt of our sinnes being taken away by his alsufficient satisfaction undefined span alphabet that which the law requireth unto justification might by christ bee fulfilled in us who are his members which walke not as also hee had said in the first verse not after the flesh but after the spirit


xi
as if the apostle had said although the body of sinne and

death remaine in us who are both justified which made mee cry out chap
yet forasmuch as wee are delivered therefrom by iesus christ our lord to whom all thanks is therefore due vers
doe therfore now assure all the faithfull and true members of christ who may be knowne by this marke that they live not after the flesh but after the spirit that they are delivered from damnation and their salvation is sure
now there are
things whereby christ hath delivered us from the law of sin and death that is from the power or guilt of sin and of death the former is the power and merit of christs perfect obedience and holynes which is called the law of the spirit of life in christ the other his sufferings wherein he yeelded an allsufficient satisfaction by bearing the punishment whereby sinne was condemned in our nature which had sinned which nature though undefined span alphabet free from sinne as chrysostme

speaketh yet like to the sinfull flesh that is to say passible hee therefore tooke upon him that because by the observation of the law in our owne persons it was impossible by reason of our flesh to be justified all which the law required to justification might ee doth not say by us but in us that is in our nature be performed by christ for it is christ as

chrysostme saith that fulfilled undefined span alphabet in us and for us who are his true members and are to be knowne as said by this marke that live not

after the flesh but after the spirit
and therefore this place proveth that because it is impossible by reason of the flesh to bee justified by that righteousnesse which is prescribed in the law therefore god in his mercy sent his sonne to take our nature upon him that therein he might performe for us whatsoever the law it selfe required to justification
thus this place is expounded by

chrysostome undefined span alphabet saith he is undefined span alphabet not to be subject to the curse and that christ fulfilled it for us

oecumenius in like maner if any man should say what is this to us he saith these things christ did that the scope of the law for that is undefined span alphabet might be fulfilled in us
and what is the scope of the law that wee should not bee obnoxious to the curse
or as

chrysostome in another place the end of the law is that a man might be justified
for what did the law intend to make a man just but it was not able because no man fulfilled it

theodore when the law was not able to performe what it intended by reason of their weakenesse to whom it was onely begotten word of god made man by the humane flesh overcame sinne having fulfilled all righteousnesse
and being not infected with any blemish of sinne and having undergone the death of sinners as if hee had been a sinner
and on those words that the righteousnesse of the law might bee in us hee paid our debt saith hee and performed the end and scope of the law what was that that he might declare them to be just that is that hee might justifie them to whom the law was given

ambrose quando impletur in bis justificati legis nis cum datur remissi omnium peccatorum when is the justification of the law fulfilled in us but when the remission of all our sinnes is granted to us for as have before alleaged out of

augustine all the commandements are reputed done when that which is not done is pardoned
if therefore this place were to bee understood of our fulfilling the righteousnesse of the law in or by our selves christ had not obtained his end· for so long as the flesh that is our inbred cotruption by reason whereof it is impossible for the law to justifie remaineth as in this life it alwayes doth even in the best so long it is not possible either to fulfill the law or to be justified by the observation of it


xii
to the second place which is the third petition of the

lords prayer answere that wee pray not that we upon earth may in equality of obedience match the angels in heaven but that we may imitate their obedience and bee like to them in doing the will of god willingly readily faithfully constantly
for the particle undefined span alphabet as signifieth not parity but likeness
in the life to come wee shall indeed be undefined span alphabet matth


as the angels but here wee may not dreame of angelicall perfection

to the

third answere that our saviour is authour of salvation to all that obey him which is to bee understood both of the obedience of faith which is the principall for this is the

worke of god by which in christ wee fulfill the law that wee beleeve in christ

and also of our new obedience
but neither of both doth argue the perfect fulfilling of the law in our owne persons
this threefold cord therefore is easily dissolved


xiii
his fifth reason whosoever have the holy spirit they fulfill

the law

all that are truely justified have the holy spirit rom



cor

gal


tit

therefore all that are truely justified fulfill the law

the proposition hee proveth thus whosoever have the fruits of the spirit gal

they fulfill the lawe all that have the spirit have the fruits of the spirit therefore all that have the spirit fulfill the law
this second proposition hee proveth because against those who produce the fruits of the spirit as charity joy peace
there is no law that is the law hath not whereof to accuse them as the breakers thereof
therefore whosoever is justified by the helpe of the spirit he fulfilleth the law and if he doe not fulfill the law then hath he not received the spirit neither is he truely justified
to the proposition of the first syllogisme answere that those who have received the spirit doe keepe the law
but none fulfill the law who have not the fulnesse of the spirit and none have the fulnesse of the spirit in whom the flesh remaineth lusting against the spirit
in whom this conflict is as it is in the best they cannot doe the things that they would gal


and much lesse can they fulfill the law from which they are so farre as that the good things they would they doe not and the evill things which they would not they doe rom

and so to the proposition of the second syllogisme that those who have the spirit have the fruits of the spirit but not without measure nor in full measure but according to the measure of the gift of christ ephes


having received but the first fruits of the spirit rom


as for his third prosyllogisme that against such there is no

law the meaning is not that those which have the fruits of the spirit doe never transgresse the law for in many

things we offend all but the words are to be understood either of the fruites of the spirit that against such there is no law but against the contrary fruites of the flesh or of the persons indued with the fruites of the spirit and then the meaning is either as tim


that the law is not given to such or as gal


that those who are led by the spirit are not under the law that is they are neither under the curse not yet under the terrour and dominion of the law as if they needed thereby to bee forced to obedience but they are as it were a law unto themselves willingly performing obedience to that which the law prescribeth according to the measure of grace received not but that sometimes they faile the flesh prevailing against the spirit
not under the curse nor subject to the accusation and condemnation of

the law because in christ who hath freed them from the curse their sinnes are forgiven

who then shall lay any thing to the charge of gods children seeing it is god that doth justifie who shall condemne seeing christ who dyed for us maketh also intercession for us
but this doth not prove that therefore the faithfull sinne not
but this proveth that when having sinned they confesse their sinnes god is just to forgive them because wee have an advocate with the father christ iesus the righteous and hee is the propitiation for our sinnes
in this forgivenesse of our sinnes and gods acceptation of us in christ and not in our obedience doth our justification consist
but he that fulfilleth the law needeth not remission of sinnes which all doe need
and therefore desperate is bellarmines conclusion that whosoever is justified fulfilleth the law and whosoever doth not fulfill the law which no man doth is not justified


xiv
and such also is his last argument which may thus bee

framed

whosoever sinneth not fulfilleth the law
of every justified man it may be verified that he sinneth not
therefore every justified man fulfilleth the law

the proposition he proveth because he that sinneth not doth not transgresse the law and he that doth not transgresse the law doth fulfill it

first answere to the proposition and the proofe thereof that they are true if understood of continued acts as thus hee that sinneth not that is that never sinneth hee that transgresseth not the law that is that never doth transgresse it doth fulfill it
for none doe fulfill the law but they who continue in all the things that are written in the booke of the law to doe them which is duely to bee marked
for the papists seeme to bee of this opinion that by any one act of obedience wherein a man sinneth not hee doth fulfill the law
and so they feare not to say that every worke of charity doth absolutely merit eternall life wherein they doe grievously erre imagining that as one act committed against charity doth absolutely deserve damnation so any one act proceeding from charity doth absolutely merit salvation
but who knoweth not that the whole law of god is copulative and so to bee understood
as therefore in a copulative proposition consisting of many suppose twenty parts if any one bee false though all the rest be true the whole proposition is false and to be denyed
so if a man should keepe all the commandements and transgresse any one though it were but once hee is a transgressor of the law and is as

saint iames saith guilty of all and by the sentence of the law is subject to the curse because he hath not

continued in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them
hee that would bee thought to fulfill the law must not onely abstaine from all the things forbidden but hee must also doe the things commanded hee must doe all hee must continue in doing all
and thus if the proposition and the proofe thereof bee

understood he that sinneth not he that transgresseth not the law that is he that never sinneth he that never transgresseth the law doth fulfill it are true but otherwise they are false and to be denyed


xv
come to the assumption which bellarmine proveth thus
whosoever is regenerate and borne of god sinneth not
all that are justified are regenerate and that because no man denyethit he proveth by manifold testimonies ioh



pet

ioh

rom

therefore those that are justified sinne not

the proposition he proveth out of ioh

whosoever is borne of god sinneth not neither can he sinne because he is borne of god
yet will not answere him as he answereth us

viz that there be five expositions of this place and never a one of them to the purpose and so dismisse it being indeed unanswerable but answer that the apostle doth not meane that the regenerate are undefined span alphabet or doe not sinne at all for to that erroneous sense both iouin and pelag did abuse that place as bellar here doth but his meaning may be explained out of his own words in the same epistle for as in the fifth chapter

when he saith whosoeveris borne of god sinneth not he meaneth as appeareth by the words going before that he sinneth not unto death that is committeth not that unpardonable sin for which we are not to pray
so here when hee saith whosoever is borne of god doth not commit sin his meaning may be collected out of the next verse going before vers
compared with ioh

he that is borne of god worketh not sinne undefined span alphabet for hee that worketh sinne he that is a worker of iniquity is of the devill as hee saith vers
he that worketh sinne saith our saviour ioh

is the servant of sinne and therefore in him sinne reigneth
as therefore in the fifth chapter when hee saith he that is borne of god sinneth not he meaneth that he doth not so sinne as he had said vers
viz unto death so here when it is said he cannot sinne his meaning is in that manner as a worker of iniquity as the child of the devill as the servant of sinne in whom sinne reigneth
and in this sense augustine

saith in quo peccatum non regnat non peccat in whom sinne reigneth not he sinneth not namely as those who in the scriptures are called

sinners that is impenitent sinners servants of sinne in whom sinne reigneth workers of iniquity luk

matth


who shall bee condemned
but although they who are borne of god are not such as the scripture calleth sinners neither doe so sinne as the servants of sinne in whom sin reigneth yet they are penitent and beleeving sinners in whom sinne remainteh who often sinne through humane frailty
there is no man that sinneth not saith salomon

yea there is not a righteous man upon earth

that doeth good and sinneth not in many things we saith iames the just doe offend all
if we say that wee have not sinned or that wee have no sinne saith the most holy apostle saint iohn

wee deceive our selves we make him a lyer and there is no truth in us
and therefore desperate againe is bellarmines assertion that whosoever is justified or regenerated sinneth not that is never sinneth and on the other side whosoever sinneth is not a man regenerate nor justified which is to

exclude all men from iustification and consequently from salvation


xvi
and thus have answered bellarmines arguments concerning

the possibility of the law
now it may be expected that should propound and mainetaine ours
but this taske have already performed in handling the third question of this controversie concerning the matter of our justification where among many other arguments proving that we are not justified by any righteousnes inherent in us or performed by us but onely by the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him we used this

for one
by what righteousnesse we are justified the law is satisfied by christs righteousnesse alone the law is satisfied and not by that which is inherent in us or performed by us
and this assumption wee prove because wee are not able to sati fie the law neither in respect of the commandement it being by reason of the flesh impossible unto us nor in respect of the penalty which cannot be satisfied by us but with endlesse torment
so that as said before all this discourse of the possibilitie of the law is nothing but a defence against a piece of one of our arguments

now should follow him to the second point which hee propounded

to prove that the workes of the righteous are simply and absolutely just and after their manner perfect which may also seeme to be an answere to another piece of our argument
for that righteousnesse by which wee are justified is perfect such onely is the righteousnesse of christ which is out of us in him such is not that which is inherent in us as the habituall or performed by us as the actuall
bellarmine there+fore in opposition to that breach concerning perfect actuall righteousnesse propounded the proofe of this point
but that our best righteousnesse is unperfect and stained with the flesh have fully proved before and have answered all the arguments which bellarmine produceth here in my fourth

booke whereunto referre the reader
here onely signifie againe that bellarmine falleth very short in his proofes for where he should prove that the workes of the faithfull are simply and absolutely just and perfect as hee propounded the question hee now seemeth to prove this that the good workes of the righteous are truely good which we deny not


xvii
yes but you protestants will they say doe teach that

the best workes of the faithfull are sinnes ans
we doe not say that their good workes as namely their prayer or their almes are sinnes but that in them they being otherwise good there are some imperfections and staines which are sinnes in respect whereof the faithfull man in doing that which is good sinneth according to that eccl

we doe confesse that the duties which the faithfull performe are good workes and so called in the scriptures though not purely and perfectly good but having their imperfections and being stained with the flesh
even as we call a man regenerated a just or a good man though he be not perfectly just being partly flesh and partly spirit
thus a vessell wherein there is wax mixed with hony before it be clarified is truly

called a vessell of hony though not sinceri mellis of pure or sincere honey
a cup of wine wherein is a mixture of some water with wine is truely called a cup of wine though not vini meraci of pure wine
in like manner a wedge of gold wherein there is some drosse is truely called a wedge of gold though not of pure gold
an heape of corne in the floore wherein there is perhaps as much chaffe as wheat is truly called an heape of wheat
a field wherein are tares and other weeds as well as corne is notwithstanding called a corne field the denomination being taken from the better part
verily whiles we live in this world we are as gold wherein there is much drosse and never are fully refined untill wee are to bee translated into the celestiall house of god
whiles we are in the church militant as it were in gods floore we are mingled with much chaffe and are never perfectly cleansed from the chaffe of our corruptions untill we are to be translated into the lords granaries
and such as wee are such also are our actions such as the tree is such is the fruit
but if hee will prove that men are justified by their workes hee must prove not onely that they are truely good but also purely and perfectly good and not onely that some of their workes are truely and purely good but that all their workes are truely and perfectly and not that onely but also perpetually good
for if any of his workes bee sinnes he cannot be justified by his workes
but this can never be proved
neither doth hee goe about to prove that all the actions of justified men are good but some onely and these not purely and perfectly but truely good
to which purpose he spendeth three whole

chapters which have fully answered in my fourth

booke

chap
viii
whether good workes doe justifie
bellarmines proofe but especially that testimony of saint iames chapter
fully discussed and clared


after so many wandrings bellarmine at length commeth to make good his fifth argument

which he propounded to prove that faith alone doth not justifie because good workes doe also justifie though here as have noted this argument is brought in to prove the truth of actuall righteousnesse
the title of this chapter is that good workes are not onely just but that also they doe justifie
in stead whereof he presently propoundeth this assertion to be proved that by good workes a just man is more justified and made more just
but this is not the question
for we doe confesse that a man already justified before god by the practise of good works increaseth in righteousnesse inherent and is made more holy and just
the thing which we deny is this that good workes doe not concurre with faith unto the act of iustification before god as any cause thereof
against this assertion he ought to have disputed if he would seeme to contradict us
but he hath altered the question because he is not able to mainetaine the contradictory of our assertion and maketh the question to be this whether by good workes men are justified that is to say made more just viz in respect of righteousnesse inherent
but we deny that there are any degrees of justification or that a man may be more justified or that justification doth ever signifie increase of righteousnesse wee reject their new· found distinction of justification into the first and second and acknowledge no other justification but that which in the scriptures and fathers is called the justification of a sinner and thereby wee understand a continued act of god who as when we being sinners did first beleeve did justifie us so remaining sinners in our selves he doth still justifie us by imputation of christs righteousnesse acquitting us from our sinnes and accepting of us as righteous in christ
and this justification which is onely acknowledged by the scriptures and fathers is every where ascribed to faith
whereas the first justification of the papists is ascribed to charity as the onely forme the second to workes as to the merit thereof
but all this ariseth from their erroneous and wilfull confounding of justification and sanctification
for their first justification is that which the scriptures

call regeneration and is the first act of sanctification by which we are habitually sanctified for they make it to be nothing else but the infusion of the habits of grace their second justification is their actuall fanctification or exercise of good workes whereby their inherent righteousnesse or sanctification is increased
but the question is not of sanctification but of justification which the papists by their wicked doctrine confounding it with sanctification have wholly abolished it being the maine benefit of the messias by which we are both freed from hell and entitled to heaven
neither is the question understood of justification before men but before god
for before men we doe confess that by good workes men are justified that is declared and known to be just as by the fruits effects consequents and signes of justification by faith but before god we are not justified that is made or constituted just by works as any cause thereof for good workes goe not before justification but follow after which is a plaine evidence that they are no cause of it


ii
but let us examine his proofes the first and principall is out

of iames
which being the onely place of scripture whereupon with any shew of probability they ground their doctrine of justification by workes will not content my selfe to answere bellarmines cavils alone but will endevour to stop the mouthes of all the papists who use to vaunt of this place especially of the
verse where they bragge that their assertion is expressed and ours confuted in plaine termes yee see then that a man is justified by workes and not by saith onely
which words are a consectary or conclusion deduced from the example of abraham who though he were justified by faith without works as saint paul teacheth yet was hee also justified by workes and not by faith onely as saint iames affirmeth
a conclusion therefore in shew of words contradictory

to that of the apostle paul rom

wee conclude that a man is justified by faith without the workes of the law and gal


we know that a man is not justified by the workes of the law· undefined span alphabet that is but onely by faith which no doubt was the apostles meaning
for as have shewed heretofore if this be a good disjunction that we are justified either by faith or by works that is either by the righteousnes of christ which is out of us in him apprehended by faith or by the works of the law that is by righteousnes inherent in our selves all which is prescribed in the law as undoubtedly it is for a third thing cannot be named whereby we might be justified and by both we cannot for if by faith then of grace and if of grace then not of works and contrary wise rom



then it followeth necessarily that if we are not justified by workes we are justified by faith alone
hence ariseth this great controversie between the true catholiks and the papists we affirming that we are justified by faith without works or by faith alone the papists contending that wee are justified by workes and not by faith only we alleaging the authority of saint paul in his epistles to the omanes galatians ephesians the papists this testimony of saint iames


iii
the way to determine this weighty controversie is to reconcile

the seeming difference betweene the two apostles
some

a when they were not able to untye this gordian knot have sought with alexander to cut it by questioning without just cause the authority of that epistle of saint iames
but the papists and wee are thus farre agreed
first as they doe not deny those epistles of paul which were never questioned so we acknowledge this of saint iames though it hath beene questioned to bee canonicall
secondly that the two apostles acted by the same spirit of truth in penning their epistles could not possibly deliver contrary assertions and consequently that they onely are to bee esteemed to hold the truth who fitly reconciling the seeming variance betweene the two apostles doe teach that doctrine which is agreeable to both
here then am to demonstrate both against the papists and for our selves against the papists three things
first that the doctrine which they ground upon this place of saint iames is contrary to that of saint paul
secondly that their exposition of saint iames they make him contradict the apostle paul
thirdly that their doctrine cannot be grounded upon this text
for our selves two things
first that by our exposition the two apostles are easily reconciled
secondly that the assertion of the two apostles according to our doctrine not onely may well stand together but also of necessity must goe together
for the first wee have the same controversie with the papists as have noted before which the apostle maintayned against the justiciaryes of his time
and their opposite doctrine to saint paul which they would gladly father upon saint iames standeth in those six maine errours which have plainely and fully confuted in this treatise
and namely in this particular they affirming that men are justified by workes which the apostle every were constantly denyeth
to the second whiles they understand the two apostles to speake in the same sense of faith of workes of justifying as namely that both speake of a true justifying faith of workes as causes of justification of justifying as making just by righteousnesse inherent they make the one directly to contradict the other
for if paul affirme that men are justified by a true faith without workes and iames deny it if paul deny that we are justified by workes as the causes of justification and iames affirme it if paul deny that wee are made just before god by workes and iames affirme it how doe they not contradict one another


iv
bellarm hopeth to salve the matter with his distinction

of the first and second justification that paul speaking of the justification wherein a man of a sinner is made just excludeth workes done by the strength of nature without faith and without grace and that iames speaking of the second justification wherein a just man is made more just saith that by the workes of grace proceeding from faith a man is justified

answ
such a distinction might be applyed to sanctification which is partly habituall the which they call their first justication consisting chiefly in charity and partly actuall which is their second justfication consisting in good workes but being applyed to justification it hath no ground either in the scriptures or in the ancient

fathers
neither can any such distinction possibly bee applied to that justification which the scriptures teach as have showed

heretofore
secondly if there could be such a distinction would say that paul when hee denyeth abraham to have been justified by workes did speake of the second justification wich bellarmine himselfe confesseth
for abraham when he was said to be justified by faith without workes did abound which workes as bellarmine confesseth and yet was not justifyed by them
and that iames when hee speaketh of rahab the harlot whom hee affirmeth to have been justified by workes speaketh of the first justification as bellarmine also affirmeth
if therefore paul say that in the first justification none are justified by workes and iames affirme that some are as namely rahab if the apostle iames say that abraham in his second jstification was justified by workes and paul doe as planiely deny it how are they reconciled againe saith bellarmine paul from justification onely excludeth the workes done without grace iames includeth onely the workes of grace
answeare that paul excludeth from justification abrahams workes which as else where

hee testifieth he wrought by faith and iames includeth the workes of rahab the harlot which was done as bellarmine saith without grace going before
where desire the reader to observe what bellarmine answeareth
as paul saith hee when he did speake of the first justification brought the example of abraham which was indeed of the second that hee might prove as it were majori from the greater that a sinner cannot bee justified by workes done without faith if righteous abraham was not made more just by his workes done without faith even so iames when hee did speake of the second justification brought the example of rahab which is of the first justification that hee might prove majori hee should say minori if my logicke faile me not from the lesse that a just man is made more just by his workes and not onely by faith if rahab of an harlot was made just by workes and not onely by faith
answ
thus then hee maketh the apostles to argue
if abrahams workes would not have justified him without faith much lesse would the good workes of the wicked
and if rahab by her worke of mercie was of an harlot made just how much more shall the good workes of the righteous make them more just



where by the way you may note diverse absurdities which have partly touched before
first that the apostle forsooth bringeth abraham as an example of justification by workes when it is most evident that hee bringeth him as an example of justification by imputation of righteousnesse without workes and maketh his example the exemplar or patterne of all others who in like maner are justified by faith without workes or by imputation of righteousnes without workes

secondly that paul produceth abraham as an example to prove that a just man is more justified by his workes for which there is no colour praeter impudentiam asseverandi the contrary is proved that

paul speaking of the justification of a sinner applyeth what hee saith to abraham
for hee proveth that abraham was not justified by workes because the scripture saith

abraham beleeved god and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse
now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt
but to him that worketh not but beleeveth on him that iustifieth the ungodly which was abrahams case his faith is counted for righteousnesse

thirdly the apostle when he excludeth abrahams workes from iustification doth not exclude his good and gracious workes but such as hee did or might have done without grace that is to say gracelesse workes
but no doubt the apostles intent in producing the example of abraham which chrysostome also hath observed was this if abraham who did abound with so many notable works which hee wrought by faith was not iustified by them but onely by faith then it is certaine that none are iustified by workes though their workes be never so gracious
fourthly he supposeth that gracious abraham might have done good workes without grace and that the apostle denyeth him to have bene iustified by such workes as hee might have done but did not
fifthly by an impudent devise whereof there is no colour hee maketh the apostle from the example of abraham to argue majori
if abrahams workes would not have iustified him unlesse they had proceeded from faith then much lesse can the workes of sinners and unregenerate men done without faith iustifie them
sixthly he shamefally inverteth the apostles question and perverteth his whole disputation as if the apostle disputed this question whether workes doe iustifie without faith which hee doth never so much as mention and not whether faith doth iustifie without workes which is indeed the question
seventhly where hee saith that the apostle excludeth workes onely from their imaginary first iustification which is meerely habituall hee conceiveth that the apostle tooke all these paines to prove that workes are no part of habituall righteousnesse
eightly where hee saith that the apostle excludeth from iustification workes of nature and not of grace it is as much as if hee should have said that the apostle doth so seriously labour to prove that men are not justified by such workes as are not good but evill

to conclude it is evident that the apostle paul excludeth from the act of justification all workes in geall whether done before grace or after of all men whether unregenerate or regenerate even of abraham himself
yea more specially the workes of the faithfull and regenerate
first because he speaketh of good workes even the workes of righteousnesse which wee the faithfull have done tit

secondly the question being whether faith doth justifie without workes or whether faith and workes together the

apostle must be understood to exclude those workes from the act of justification which with faith concurre in the party justified
even as abraham though his faith was accompanied with store of good works yet he was justified and so are all the faithfull by faith without works

if therefore st iames doe affirme that men are justified in the same sence that paul denyeth the same and that abraham was justified by his workes which paul denyeth he is made to contradict the apostle paul


vi
but as the popish doctrine is repugnant to the doctrine of the apostle paul so neither can it bee grounded upon this text

which may appeare by a briefe analysis thereof
where first you are to consider the occasion of this discourse and thereupon the scope of the apostle therein
the occasion was the dissolute life of many

christians who as iude speaketh vers
did turne the grace of god into wantonnes vaine men as st iames calleth them vers
who when they had learned that a man is justified by faith without workes hereby tooke occasion to cast of all care of good workes
as if it were sufficient for them howsoever they lived to professe them selves to believe

the scope therfore and intendement of the apostle is not to confute the doctrine of paul concerning justification by faith alone but according to pauls direction tit
to perswade all those who professe themselves to believe to be studious of good workes
and that hee doth by this argument because howsoever faith doth justifie alone yet the profession of faith alone without good workes will not justifie nor save a man but is altogether vaine and unprofitable
the undefined span alphabet or state of the question which hee propoundeth to argue manifestly appeareth by the proposition wherein the question is propounded and by the conclusion wherein the question is concluded the proposition vers
what profit my brethren if a man say hee hath faith and hath not workes will undefined span alphabet that faith save him marke the wordes if a man shall say hee hath faith that is if a man shall professe himself to believe and hath not works that is a conversation answerable in some measure to his profession will that faith which is in profession onely justifie or save him this interrogation implyeth a most emphaticall negation wherein hee doth not onely deny that faith which is onely in profession and doth not worke by love doth justifie or save a man but also for the truth of his deniall hee doth appeale as it were to their conscience sor so much is meant by the interrogation
the question then is not whether true faith doe justifie alone as bellarmine would have it but whether that faith which is alone and by it selfe vers
without workes without a christian conversation be a true justifying or saving saith
this the apostle denieth and so doe wee
in the rest of the discourse hee proveth this negative assertion by an argument from the contrary namely that this fruitlesse faith is not a true faith because it is dead
where the apostle argueth to

this effect that faith which is dead doth not iustifie or save a man the faith which is profession onely and is alone without workes is dead
therefore that faith which is in profession onely and is alone without workes doth not iustifie or save a man

the assumption hee proveth in this whole discourse where the conlusion is alwayes this that the faith which is alone and without workes is dead and therefore that is the question wich is disputed and concluded


vii
now that the faith which is alone and without workes

is dead hee proveth by five arguments


the first par that charity which is onely in word and not in deed is vaine and unprofitable vers

even so pariratione that faith which is in profession only having no works to accompany it is dead vers

the second argument is taken from the effects
for a true lively faith may bee demonstrated by good workes and that which cannot be demonstrated by good workes is but a dead faith
and this hee proveth vers
against the carnall gospeller as it were by the partyes owne testimony or forced confession provoking him to make experience which kind of proofe is called undefined span alphabet
thou professest the faith having no workes also professe the faith and have workes come now to the tryall hee that hath a true faith may approve it by the fruits shewe then they faith if thou canst by thy workes which thou knowest thou canst not doe and by my workes will approve my faith

the third argument is from the subject
for a true justifying faith is not common to all men

thes

and much lesse to devils but is proper to the elect tit

but that faith which men professe without charity and without good workes is common to devils vers
thou professest that thou believest that there is one god thou doest well but if this thy beliefe be not accompanied with charity and good workes know this that the devils themselves who hate god doe though with horrour knowe and perforce believe the same


the fourth argument to prove that faith onely professed or which is in profession onely is not a true and a lively but a conterfeit and a dead faith is a twofold example of abraham and of rahab who were justified that is declared and knowne to be just by their workes
for in this sence as the word is often used in the scriptures as mt

luk




tim

so of necessity it must bee taken in this place
for by good workes which alwaies followe and never goe before justification wee are not made just but being already justified wee are by them declared and knowne to be just
for hee is a righteous

man that worketh righteousnesse
and this the schoolmen themselves doe teach that works do justifi clarativè ths aquinas saith

opera nn sunt casa quòd aliqui sit itus apud deum workes are not the cause why

any man is just before god but rather they are the executions and manifestations of iustice
nam nullus per opera iustificatur apud deum sed per habitum fidei
for no man is iustified before god by workes but by the habit of faith
and whereas it might bee obiected out of iam
that abraham was iustified by workes hee answeareth

the word to be iustified many be taken two wayes whereof the one is quantum ad executionem iustitiae manifestationem inrespect of execution and manifestation of iustice hoc mdo iustificatur homo iustus ostenditur ex operib operatis and thus a man is iustified that is declared be iust by the workes which hee hath done
and thus the ordinary glosse expoundeth the word in this place
but let us come to the words
vers


viii
but wilt thou know vaine man that faith that is

that faith professed or in profession onely without workes is dead or that the faith which is without workes is knowne to be dead
for the life of faith it self doth not depend upon workes as the cause but is thereby knowne as by the effects
you see againe what the question is which hee will conclude namely that the faith which is without workes or which is in profession onely without workes is not a lively but a dead faith and consequently not a justifying faith
for a justifying faith is like the faith of abraham and of rahab but that faith which is in profession onely and wanteth workes is not like the faith of abraham and of raba
for though abraham was iustified by faith without workes as the apostle paul proveth yea by faith alone as the papists themselves confesse yet the faith by which hee was justified was not alone but was fruitfull of good workes by which both hee and his faith were justified that is knowne to be just and upright


ix vers
was not abraham our father saith hee justified

by workes when hee had offered his sonne isaack upon the altar of which wordes the meaning is not that abraham by that worke was justified before god or made just for long before the holy ghost gave him this testimony gen
abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousnesse not that then hee first believed or was then first justified for when hee first left his countrey which hee left by faith heb

hee had believed and his faith no doubt was imputed to him for righteousnesse but that by that speciall worke after hee was proved hee was approved and knowne to be a righteous man
for upon abrahams approbation of his faith and obedience when he was tryed the lord gave him this testimony gen

now know that thou fearest god did not god know it before yea no doubt but hee speaketh after the maner of men
he had tempted abraham that is by a commandement of tryall hee had proved his faith and obedience not that hee did not know but that he would make it knowne to abraham and others
as on the contray god is said
chron

to have left ezechias to try him that hee might know that is that hee might make knowne

all that was in his heart when as therefore abraham being tryed had by that act of offering his sonne approved his faith and obedience the lord saith now know that is now by this tryall it is made knowne that thou art a just man and one that feareth god
and in this sence as it is most manifest hee is said by his workes to have been justified that is knowne declared approved to be a just man


hereupon st iames inferreth vers
doe you not see

how faith did to or with his workes the verbe undefined span alphabet may be understood two wayes either that faith with other graces did to the bringing forth of this worke as namely with the feare of god and love of god gen

though faith was the principall heb

or else that faith did with his workes not to justifie him before god but to manifest declare and approve his righteousnes
in which sence we must understand the word faith as in the proposition vers
for faith professed or the profession of faith which doth concurre together with workes to make a man truely justified to bee knowne
and in this sence faith doth with works and may be said to justifie by declaring a man to be just though bellarmine holdeth the contrary
for that a man may bee acknowledged to be a man truely justified before god by faith two things must concurre the profession of the true faith and a christian conversation neither of which alone is sufficient

it followeth in the same verse and by workes was faith made perfect
which words saith bellarmine cannot signifie any other but that his righteousnesse which was begunne by faith was perfected by good works
answ
but iames doth not say that his righteousnesse but his faith was perfected and whereas hee saith the words cannot signifie otherwise say they may be understood two other wayes
first that faith by workes is perfected because by workes it is manifested and perfectly knowne in which sence gods strength is perfected in our weakenesse
cor

secondly because workes bring the fruits and effects of faith to be perfected when it bringeth forth good fruits according to his kind
for when any thing hath attayned to the end as it hath when it doth effectually produce those uses or fruits for which it was ordayned it is said undefined span alphabet to be perfect
now the end of our justification by faith is our sanctification
for when faith was wrought in us that is to say in our regeneration we were the workemanship of god created unto good workes which god hath preordayned that wee should walke in them
eph

faith therefore may then bee said to be perfected when it doth effectually bring forth the fruit of good workes whereby a man is not made but declared to be just


xi vers
and this appeareth yet more plainely by that which followeth
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse

this scripture was fulfilled gen

above
yeares before his offering of isaake and here againe it is said to have been fulfilled in this act that is the truth of that testimony which was given him so long before was then manifested when by this worke hee evidently declared that hee was indued with a true lively iustifying faith
and to the like purpose the same sentence might as bellarmine confesseth be applyed to abraham in respect of any other notable fruit of his faith that then also that sentence was verified abraham believed god
for then it was declared and manifested that hee was indued with a true iustifying faith
as for that conceipt of bellarmine that if the hebrew word be well scanned it will appeare that the meaning of the words is that abrahams believing god was a ust worke it is but a poore shift
for paul understandeth it of abrahams person and maketh that text his principall ground of the iustification of the faithfull by imputation of righteousnesse without workes
and iames likewise understandeth it of abrahams person shewing that by this act of offering his sonne the truth of that testimony was manifested that hee was indued with a true faith by which hee was iustified

it followeth in the same verse and hee was called the friend of god

chron


esai

that is by this act hee approved himselfe to bee such a one


xii hereupon saint iames verse
inferreth this consectary

or conclusion you see then by this example of abraham that a man who is justified before god by faith alone as abraham was and that by imputation of righteousnesse without workes is also justified by workes as abraham was that is by them as by fruites and effects hee is declared and approved to bee just and not by faith professed onely
hee doth not say a man is justified by workes as causes but as the effects
for that and not the other is deduced from the example of abraham


xiii
the other example is of rahab verse
for though

you may thinke that you need not compare with abraham and yet have a true justifying faith yet you will bee ashamed to bee behinde rahab the harlot who was no sooner justified before god by faith but she was also justifyed that is declared and knowne to bee just by her worke of charity towards the espyes which shee wrought by faith heb


concerning this example of rahab bellarmine hath foure assertions of which never an one agreeth with another
first that rahab was not declared to bee just because shee was an harlot which is false
for though shee had beene an harlot yet now she beleeved and by her faith was justifyed before god and by her worke which shee wrought by faith was justified as saint iames saith that is declared to bee just
secondly that iames brigeth the example of rahab to prove that by good workes a righteous person is made more righteous which also is false and contrary to his former assertion
thirdly that by

this worke of mercy shee was truely justified and of a sinner made just
but rahab as bellarine saith was an example of the first justification and therefore of a sinner not made just by her worke but by the habit of grace infused
the trueth is by faith shee was justifyed before god and by her worke shee was declared to bee just before men
fourthly that by that worke as a disposition she was prepared unto justificaion
which agreeth neither with his third where he said that by this worke shee was truely justifyed and of a sinner made just nor with saint mes whose meaning plainely is not that shee was prepared unto justification by this worke no more than abraham was by his but that she was declared by this worke as a fruite of her faith and a consequent of her justification as abraham was by his workes to be justifyed before god
and thus much of the two examples


xiv
there remaeth his fifth argument which is a similitude

verse
for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without workes or that faith which is without workes is dead which words also may bee two wayes expounded
for either the apostle iames speaketh of the habit of faith or of the profession of it
if of the habit then the comparison standeth thus as the body of man without the spirit that is without breath which is the prime signification of the word undefined span alphabet derived from undefined span alphabet to breathe in which sense it is called the spirit of the mouth and spirit of the nostrils say as the body without breath is dead so that saith which is without workes which are as it were the breathing of a lively faith is judged to be dead
for as

bernrd also saith as we discerne the life of this body by its motion so the life of faith by workes
if therefore faith it selfe be here meant wee must by spirit understand breath and not the soule
for although the papists absurdly make charity which is a fruite of faith tim

to be the forme of it yet me thinkes they cannot bee so absurd as to compare faith to the body and workes to the soule as though workes which are the fruites and effects both of faith and of charity were the forme and as it were the soule of faith

if by faith we understand faith professed or the profession of faith as in this discouse hitherto it hath beene used and as it is used elsewhere as act


rm

then you may understand the similide thus as the body of man without the spirit that is the oule is dead so the profession of faith without a godly life which is as it were the life and oule of our profeon is also dead
for hypocrites whose life is not conformable to their profession though they have a ame that they live yet they are dead
apc

thus by five arguments saint imes hath proved that the faith which is alone and without workes is not a true and a lively but a dead and counterfeit faith and yet both here and lib
justif cap

will needs have saint ames to speake of a true faith as if he supposed that a true faith might be without workes

therefore the popish doctrine of justification by workes as

causes thereof cannot be grounded on this txt of saint iames


xv yea but will some say the contradiction is not yet salved

for saint paul affirmeth as you say that faith alone doth justify and saint iames in plaine termes denyeth that a man is justifyed by faith onely
answere when we say that faith onely doth justify we doe not meane absolutely that nothing doth justify but faith in no sense whatsoever
for many things may truely bee said to justify ali atque ali sensu in divers senses as have shewed heretofore
god the father as the prime efficient christ as the meritorious cause god as the iudge christ as the advocate
god as the creditour christ as the surety
the grace of god as the moving cause the righteousnes of christ as the matter the imputation thereof as the forme the holy ghost as the applying cause the word and sacraments as the instruments of the holy ghost faith as the hand of the receiver works as testimonies and signes but our meaning is that we are justified by the righteousnesse of christ onely which is apprehended by faith alone and that in us nothing doth concurre to the act of justification but faith alone it being the onely instrument whereby wee receive christ

and thus have you heard what is to be alleaged against the papists
first that their doctrine concerning justification by workes which they would build upon this text is repugnant to the scriptures
secondly that by their exposition they make saint imes to contradict saint paul
thirdly that their doctrine cannot bee grounded on this text


xvi
now for our selves will shew that by our exposition

the seeming difference betweene the two apostles is manifestly reconciled and that by our doctrine their assertions not oely may

well stand together but also must necessarily goe together
the reconciliation is easily made if we consider two things first the diversity of the parties with whom the two apostles had to deale
for the apostle paul having to deale with pharisaicall iustitiaries who sought to bee justified by a righteousnesse inherent in themselves and by an obedience performed by themselves proveth by invincible arguments that a man is justified by faith without workes
saint iames having to deale with carnall gospellers vaine men turning the grace of god into wantonnesse who having heard that faith doth justifie without workes did cast off all care of good workes thinking it sufficient to professe themselves to beleeve though their life were dissolute
against these saint iames proveth that vaine is the profession of faith without good works that the faith which is without works is not a true liuely justifying faith but a dead and counterfeit faith that whosoever is justified before god by faith must also be justified that is declared and approved to bee just not onely by profession of his faith but also by the practise of good workes
wherefore in this respect there is no more difference betweene the two apostles paul and iames than betweene lther and us who are preachers of the

gospell at this day
for as luther having to deale with popish justitiaies who taught justification by workes urgeth most zelously justification by faith alone and in the question of justification after the example of saint paul speaketh contemptuously of workes so we having to dle with libertines and carnall gospellers insisting in the steppes of saint iames urge the necessity of good workes


xvii
secondly wee are to consider the divers acceptions of

the words faith workes justifie in the writings of the two apostles
paul speaking of a true lively faith which worketh by love saith in effect that faith alone doth justifie
iames speaking of the faith of hypocrits which is in profession only svered from the grace of sanctification and destitute of good workes aith that such a faith doth neither justifie alone nor at all as being not a true but a dead and counterfeit faith

paul speaking of the cuses of justification before god denyeth workes to concurre to the act of justification as any cause thereof· iames speaking of the effects and ignes of justificatin whereby it may be knowne affirmeth that workes must concurre in the parties justified that by them our faith may be demonstrated nd our justification manifested
paul therefore rejecteth workes obtruded as causes of justification iames urgeth thm as effects and signes thereof
paul speaking of iustification in the proper sense as it signifieth that gracios action of god whereby wee are made or constituted just affirmeth that wee are justified by faith without workes
iames speaking of tht justifiction whereby we are not mde just before god but declared and to god our and our conscience to bee just and indued with a true faith that we are so justified not onely by the profession of faith but also by good workes

now these very well stand together
for although it be most true which saint paul affirmeth that true faith doth just fie alone yet it is true which saint iames faith that the faith which is alone doth not justifie neither lone nor at all because it is not true and a lively but a and dead faith
for the living eye though it see alone yet is not alone so a liuely fith though it justifie alone yet never alone though it justifie without workes yet it is not without works
though good workes doe not to the act of justification a any cause therof according to saint pauls doctrin yet they must concurre in the same subject that is the party justified as necessary fruit and of true justifying aith saint iaes cheth
though we be justified before god that is both absolved from our and accepted in christ as righteous by faith alone without respect of work as saint paul teacheth yet according to the doctrine of aint iames we are to bee justified that is declared and approved to be just not onely by faith professed but also by good workes
finally though good workes nn yet justifica as augustin useth to speake or as he also saith non predunt iustifiandum sed justificat though they doe not go before justification as causs pl teacheth yet they must follow in the parties justified

as effects according to saint iames his doctrine


xviii
but the assertions of the
apostles not only may wel stand

togeher but also according to our doctrine they must necessarily goe together
for if we shall be altogether conversant in setting forth the commendation of good works and in urging the necessity thereof not informing the people in the doctrine of justification by faith alone they will be ready to place the matter of their justification and the merit of their salvation in themselves as the papists doe
and so being ignorant of gods

righteousnesse and seeking to establish their owne righteousnesse they doe not submit themselves to the righteousnes of god
but wee must so urge the necessity of good workes in the doctrine of sanctification that wee remember that in the question of justification they are of no value
on the other side if wee shall be wholly taken up in the doctrine of justification by faith alone teaching that in the question of justification they are of no worth and doe not withall informe the people of the profit and necessity of good works in other respects how ready will they bee to cast off all care of good workes and content themselves with a bare profession of faith but wee joyne these assertions together after the doctrine and practise of the apostles in their

epistles
wee teach that justification and sanctification are unseparable companions
and theresore as they who are sanctified may bee assured of their justification so without sanctification none can bee

assured of their justification
it is true that there is no condemnation to them that are in christ iesus but who are they that live not after the flesh but after the spirit

that are new creatures cor

that crucifie the flesh with the lusts thereof gal


it is true that a true lively faith doth justifie alone but what manner of saith is that that purifieth the heart act


and worketh by love gal


and may be demonstrated by good workes
iam

it is true that wee are not justified by our workes nor saved for them yet those are neither justified nor saved that are without them for as they are necessary consequents of justification so they are necessary antecedents of salvation
for though they be not the cause of our salvation yet they are the way by which we are to come to salvation though they be not causa regandi as bernard saith yet they are via regni
though they bee not the merit of salvation yet they are the evidence according to which god will judge us
by faith wee have our inheritance and our title to gods kingdome but it is to be inherited among those that are

sanctified
a godly conversation though it be not properly a cause of our glorification yet it is causa sie nn
for as the apostle saith without holinesse no man shall see god
heb

and for this cause we seriously exhrtall men who professe themselves to beleeve and to be iustified by faith to be careful that they may be

precedents of good works for these are good and profitable and necessary as shewed before

when propounded those arguments which wee doe use to move men unto good workes
so much of his first testimony


xix
to that place of saint iames he addeth

sixe other testimonies

to which a short answer will suffice
to the first out of eccles

have fully answered in the first

controversie


his second testimony is rom

as you have exhibited your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity so now exhibit

your members to serve justice unto sanctification
where unto sanctification doth not signifie to get the first holinesse sor he speaketh to them who were holy and just but to increase sanctification
but that by sanctification is meant justification and by sanctity justice it is plaine by the antithesis for he opposeth sanctification to iniquity
his argument is thus framed sanctification may and must bee increased by good workes which is proved by this text and not denyed by us

iustification is sanctification
and that he proveth because what is opposed to iniquity is justification sanctification is here opposed to iniquity
therefore here sanctification signifieth justification
ans
that justification and sanctification are by no means to be confounded
proved at large in the first

question for this is the source of all their errours in the doctrine of justification
the apostle doth carefully distinguish them
for having in the former chapters treated of justification by faith without works that men should not abuse that doctrine to licentiousnesse of life in this and the next chapter he treateth of sanctification shewing in this

chapter that sanctification is a necessary companion of justification
and therefore exhorteth those that are justifi to the dueties of sanctification
the abuse he preventeth vers
and
for wheras he had taught in the doctrine of justification that where sinne abounded grace did superabound he maketh this objection what then shall we continue in sinne that grace may abound god forbid so againe by iustification we are freed from the curse of the law and from the rigour and terrour or dominion it what then shall we sin because wee are not under the law but under grace god forbid

the unseparable conjunction of these two benefits is shewed by the

sacrament of baptisme for as it is a seale of that righteousnesse which is by faith unto us being baptized into the remission of sins so it is the laver of regeneration wherin as the apostle saith we are baptized into christs death and resurrection that as he dyed so we should dye unto sin and as he rose againe never to dye any more so wee should arise from the grave of sinne never to dye any more for how should they that are dead to sinne live any more therein and hereupon followeth his exhortation that we should not let sinne reigne in us nor give our members as instruments of unrighteousnes unto sin
and as he doth dehort us from suffering sinne to relgne in us so he assureth the faithfull that sinne shall no more haue dominion over them because they are not under the law but under grace and having prevented the abuse of that doctrine vers
he reneweth both his dehortation from suffering sinne to reigne in them because if it did reigne in them they must needes be the servants of it when as in their redemption they were freed from the bondage of sinne that they might become the servants

of righteousnesse and also his exhortation vers
that they

would yeeld their members as seruants to holinesse

to his reason that by sanctification here is meant justification because it is opposed to iniquity answere that both justification and sanctification are opposed to sinne and iniquity but with this difference
in sin there are two things the guilt and the corruption or pollution
by justification which is opposed to accusing and condemning rom

wee are freed from the guilt of sin and damnation by our sanctification which is opposed to pollution wee are freed in some measure from the corruption that it is to say from the dominion of sinne


xx
his third testimony is cor

where the apostle exhorteth

that having these promises of our justification and adoption chap
wee should cleanse our selves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit perfecting or accomplishing our sanctification in the feare of god
the apostle doth not exhort us unto justification for that is never done in all the scriptures but being justified and adopted wee are exhorted with our justification and adoption to joyne the dueties of sanctification and therein to grow and increase untill wee come to a perfect man in christ


xxi
his fourth testimony cor

he will multiply your

seed and will augment the increases of the fruits of our justice
where we are taught saith he that by our wealth is diminished but our jstice is increased
answ
we answere that by the christian practice of vertues our justice but not our justification is increased
howbeit the apostle doth not speake of justice it selfe to be increased but of the fruites of justice by justice in this place meaning as vers
and matth


liberalitie in and by the fruites of righteousnesse almes
unto which that they might bee more and more enabled the apostle prayeth that their seed may be multiplyed meaning thereby their store which in the faithfull is as it were the seed of almes that having alwayes all sufficiency in all things they might abound to every good worke being enriched in every thing to all bountifulnesse ves
so farre is the apostle from signifying that by their almesgiving their wealth should be diminished


xxii
his fifth testimony ioh

if any love me hee will

keepe my word and my father will love him
this new living after the fulfilling of the commandements what is it sath he but the increase of love and thereby of righteousnesse which by observing the law of god is required
answ
wee confessè that by the observance of the law of god our love of god is exercised and our righteousnesse increased though it be not proved out of this place
for this love after the keeping of christs word here mentioned is gods love to us not ours to him


xxiii
his sixth testimony is apoc

hee that is just let him be justified yet
answ
the word yet or still doth not signifie increase but continuance or if increase were meant it could not bee understood of the righteousnesse of justification but of sanctification
but to this allegation have answered twice before

to conclude in these six places wee have seene scarce any colour of

proofe either of justification by workes or of increase of justification and yet these besides iam
are all the testimonies which he hath alleaged out of the scriptures which being compared with those plentifull and pregnant testimonies that plainely deny justification by workes doe manifestly shew the cause of the papists to bee most desperate

but it may bee you will say that although the scriptures faile him yet hee hath store of testimonies of the fathers and plenty of reasons
out of the fathers he produceth not one testimony neither doth he give any reason but such as have beene already confuted


xxiv
to these testimonies saith he two reasons may be added out of

those things which have been proved in the former chapters concerning the possibility of the law and the truth of actuall righteousnesse for saith he if a just man can fulfill the law as before it hath beene demonstrated then ay he also without doubt be justified by workes
againe if a just man can performe workes truly good which are polluted with no vice as we have shewed before then he may worke righteousnesse and consequently may by multiplying of just workes increase his justice
answ
he should say his justification
but in both hee disputeth a posse ad esse it is possible for a man to fulfill the law and consequently to be justified by workes it is possible that a righteous man may performe some workes truely and purely good by multiplying whereof he may increase his justice
but the question is not whether some choise man one of a million can fulfill the law and bring forth workes purely good but whether every one that is justified doth fulfill the law that is doth continue in all the things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them
whether the workes yea all the workes of every one that is justified be purely good
for if he should transgresse in any one particular though it were but by omission he hath not fulfilled the law
if any of his workes were not truely and purely good or if all his workes be not pure then hee cannot be justified by workes
but he is so farre from proving these things as it were the esse that he is not able to prove the posse that any one mortall man is able to fulfill the law or that any one action of any one regenerate man is purely and perfectly good
the contraries of both which have plentifully proved before

a treatise of ivstification
the eighth booke concerning the merit of good workes
chap
setting downe the state of the controversie and propounding our arguments against the merit of good workes




there remaineth the last though not the least errour of the papists in this controversie which is concerning the efficacie of good workes
for the papists not contented to affirme that good works doe justifie doe also teach that at the hands of god they doe merit or deserve the reward of eternall life
and this in effect is the same with that which bellarmine laboured to prove when he disputed of the necessity of good workes unto salvation not onely necessitate praesentiae as the way to gods kingdome which we confesse but also necessitate efficientiae as causes thereof
for by the efficiencie which they ascribe to workes they meane no other but morall which is as they say by way of meriting
howbeit the former assertion of the necessity of efficiencie seemeth to containe a further degree of damnable errour viz that not onely good workes doe merit or deserve salvation but also that none can be saved without their owne merits for so much is implyed in the terme of the necessity of efficiencie


ii
but first we are to set downe the state of the controversie in setting downe whereof the papists are very sparing because in this

point they differ much among themselves
but yet in this they do agree

that all the good works of the regenerate are truly meritorious of eternall life
now for the explacation of the termes by good works which they say are meritorious they meane all such works as are qualified according to those seven conditions which

bellarmine requireth
first that they be materialy good or good in their kind
secondly that they be done in obedience to god
thirdly by such as are viatores men in this life
fourthly that they be free that is as they expound it voluntary proceeding from their freewill
fifthly persormed by men who are in the state of grace
sixthly having the promise of eternall reward
seventhly proceeding from the virtue of charity

secondly by all such workes they doe not onely meane all joyntly

but every one in particular affirming omne opus bonum that every good worke proceeding from charity is meritorious of eternall life
thirdly by truely meritorious the word used by the councill of trent wee understand that which properly and absolutely and for it selfe deerveth the reward thereby excluding first merita ex congruo merits of congruity which indeed doe not deserve and therefore are not veri nominis merita truely and properly merits
notwithstanding bellarmine and others retaine the name giving it chiefly to those dispositions and preparations going before justification according to which grace is given wherein they have rewarded the old assertion of pelagius gratiam secundum merita dari
for if those dispositions be merits and if according to them grace is given as the councill of trent in plaine termes

defineth doe they not hold that grace is given to men according to their merits secondly by this phrase truly and properly meritorious are excluded these workes which ar said to merit onely ex pacto which ever happeneth when there is a great disproportion between the worke and the promised reward
as if a man should for a daies labour which in commutative justice deserveth but denarium diurnum the promise an hundred pound this reward were due ex pacto but yet not deserved by the labourer
the halfe of herods kingdome was due to the daughter of herdias ex pacto if shee had asked so much but no way deserved by her
by truely and properly meritorious therefore is meant that which is condigne merit or merit of condignity that which is absolutely meritorious and not onely ex pacto by reason of the promise which happeneth when there is an equall proportion betweene the worke and the promised reward sed ratione peris ipsius for the workes sake and for the worthinesse thereof


iii
this point is duely to bee observed
for there are some tergiversators

that dare not professedly take upon them the defence of condigne merit who notwithstanding would seem as stiffe defenders of merits as the best of them
as for that qnestion whether works deserve heaven condgno or not and such like they say they are but schoole points which not being yet determined by the church may freely bee disputed of pro con
yea but thus much your church hath determined that the faithfull who are the members of christ doe by their

workes truely

merit or deserve eternall life and denounceth a curse against those who shall deny that a justified man doth by his good workes truely

merit eternall life
but there is nothing which can truly and properly be called merit but that which is of condignity and doth for it selfe and for its owne worth absolutely deserve the reward
that which is said to merit by way of congruity is not truely and properly meritorious nor that which is said meerely to merit ex pacto as where is no proportion betweene the merit and the wages
for neither of these doth truely deserve that which it is said to merit
wherefore the most and the most learned of the papists hold that there is a due proportion betweene the workes of the faithfull proceeding from charity and the heavenly reward and that they condignely merit eternall life not only in respect of gods promise but also for the worthinesse of the workes which are so dignified they say by the merit of christ that they become truely meritorious and doe in iustice according to their worth deserve the heavenly reward even as justly as the sinnes of the wicked deserve the punishment of hell
in so much that our rhemists

say good workes be meritorious and the very cause of salvation so farre that god should be unjust if he rendred not heaven for the same unjust they meane for not rendring a just and equall reward
where fore howsoever some like snailes when they are touched doe pull in their hornes yet this undoubtedly is the tenet of the learned papists at this day

opera bona justorum meritoria esse ex condigno non solum ratione pacti sed etiam ratione operum that the good workes of the righteous are condignely meritorious not onely in regard of the covenant but also in respect of the workes themselves
as for those who heretofore have denyed the absolute merit of condignity and have held either merits of congruity onely or onely ex pacto they are censured by some of the learned

among them to have differed from us in words but in deed to have agreed with us

but as for us we acknowledge no merits of eternall life but the merits of christ onely and wee doe constantly hold and confidently professe

that no meere man can merit that is deserve at the hands of god the reward of eternall life by any thing or by all the things which hee can doe or suffer in this world


iv
for the handling of this controversie will observe this order first will propound our arguments and maintaine them and then

will answere the objections of the papists

and first will speake of the name and then of the thing neither of which hath any ground in the scriptures and therefore both the name and the thing of all true christians who desire not in matters of such moment as concerne our eternall inheritance to bee wis above that which is written are to be rejected
the word mereri properly signifieth to deserve and meritum desert or that which deserveth a reward and that which doth not deserve is not properly and truely called merit
now there is neither in the canonicall scriptures nor in the greeke fathers any word or phrase truely and properly translated which being

ascribed to good workes doth signifie or import the deserving of eternall life at the hands of god
there are words and phrases importing the reward of workes both good and bad but with this difference that the eternall reward of good workes as it was according to the purpose of grace given unto us in christ

before all secular times and freely intended and preordained and according to the covenant of grace to them for whom christ hath merited the same freely promised so it is freely bestowed as undefined span alphabet the free gift of god
but the eternall reward of sinne as it is justly deserved so it is in justice rendred as the iust stipend or wages of sinne
rom

the wages of sinne is death but eternall life is the free gif of god



the latine fathers indeed doe often use the words mereri and

meritum both in the better sence and in the worse but with this difference that in the worse sense they use it properly for deserving and desert
for sinnes duely and in justice deserve punishment
but in the better sense they doe not use the word properly for deserving and desert which every man knoweth to be the proper signification but in other significations and therefore unproperly if not undefined span alphabet

the verbe is used by them sometimes and indeed very often in the generall sense either of obtayning

joyned commonly with the accusative case or of finding favour to have or to get any thing joyned with the infinitive without respect of merit and worth or relation to wages
vocabulum merendi saith

cassander the word meriting among the ancient ecclesiastical writers for the most part signifieth to obtaine or to be made fit to obtaine
the which among others appearth by that one place of cyprian

for where paul saith tim


undefined span alphabet but obtained mercie as the vulgar

latine and

erasmus cyprian readeth misericordiam merui
and so doth augustine

also
thus you see how joyned with an a accusative it signifieth to obtaine

vi sometimes they use th word in a more speciall sence and

and that two wayes

first for imptration and obtayning by request
and thus the fathers say· that men hae meited remission of sinne justification and reconciliation wit god which the papists themselves doe confesse cannot be merited se ipsa remissio saith augustine

sine aliquo merit est si fides impetrat
where to merit is to impetrate and to impe is to rit but not in the proper sence of deserving
for betweene impetratig and meriting in the proper sence there is great difference as you before out of thomas aquinas and bellarmine himselfe
thus orig

peccaum remissionem peccati meretur hierome

qui peccat merentur humilitate clementiam salvatris
of that notorious sinner augustine saith

tha when he humbled before god ita gratiam dei btinuit ut mereretur iter dei aicos postdum numer ari

sometim it signifieth to doe good workes either with relation to the reward or without
the former is as suppose he most that can bee truely gathered out of the fathers as seeming to favour the popish sence and yet even so it signifieth but to do rewardeable workes or to doe such workes by gods grace as he hath promised graciously to reward
but in the proper sense of deserving bellarmine was not able as after wee shall see when we come to his restimonies out of the fathers to produce any one testimony out of any one of them testifying that the good workes of the faithfull in and for themselves deserve eternall life or that they are truely that is condignely and absolutely meritorious of salvation


vii
so much of the verbe mereri to
the noúne meritum or name merit taken in the better part if referred to god it signifieth his beneficia if to men our officia
for those actions which the grecians call undefined span alphabet and the authours of the latine tounge officia the latine father commonly call merit ming also officia or good workes and that either simply and without relation to reward which sense is most usuall or implying relation to reward
am not ignorant saith vega

that the name merit is used of the fathers where is

no respect of merit either of congruity or of condignity
and as for augustine he is won saith bellarmine

meritum appellare quemlibet bonum actum to call merit any good act in regard where of wee receive some other thing
where it is used as the relative of reward it signifieth no more but a rewardeable work or a worke which god is pleased to reward
but wee must remember withall that gods reward of eternall life is his free gift and not deserved by us freely intended unto us in our election freely promised unto us as the inheritance purchased by christ freely given unto us as the gracious reward of our obedience by which hee doth most graciously crowne his gifts and not our merits in us as have shewed before at large


viii
now as touching the thing it selfe merit is best defined

to be a good worke deserving the reward of eternall life
some define it to be a worke to which that reward is due
but that definition is too large unlesse it bee added that to it the reward is de absolutely for the workes sake
for the reward may be due ither by dese or by promise or covenant onely as namely where there is a great disproportion between the worke and the promised reward
but that properly is not merited which is due onely by promise and is not deserved when an hundred pounds is promised for a dayes labour in the vineyard where in commutative justice the onely were sufficient the reward indeed is due when the labour is ended in regard of the promise but yet it is not deserved by the labourer
whatsoever the daughter of herodias had lawfully asked of herd though it had beene to the halfe of his kingdome it had beene due to her by promise but not deserved by her for there was no proportion between her worke or play rather and his promised reward
no more is there or rather not so much betweene the bst workes of the faithfull and the eternall reward


ix
now proceed to our arguments proving that the good

workes of the faithfull are not truely meritorious of eternall life
my proofes shall bee either demonstrative reasons drawne from the very nature and conditions of merit or authorities of holy scripture or testimonies of the fathers

unto merit so properly called divers conditions are required in respect of those relations which are considerable in merits and those are either

betweene the

parties viz

who would merit· of whom he would merit

things

meriting which is the merit selfe merited which is the reward

the parties are god and man
but man cannot merit of god for these reasons

first because betweene god and man there is no proportion

deus homo distant in ifinitum for god is infiite man compared to god is as nothing esai

one man indeed by doing good offices may merit of another
but no man that is but a man can deserve any good thing at the hands of god
our goodnesse doth no reach unto him psal


secondly because god is the absolute lord of all his creatures to whom they owe themselves and whatoever they can doe though no reward were to be expected
in so much that not adam in paradise nor the angells in heaven nor christ himselfe if hee had beene but a man could have mered any good thing at the hands of god
god deserveth of all men more than they are able to render and the better they are the more they are beholding to him
he is thy creator aith

bernard thou his creature thou the ervant hee the lord he the potter thou that which the potter frameth
totm ergo qdes

qo ttum habes
thou doest therfore owe to him all that thou ar from whom thou hast all
although faith he

a man may perhaps seeme to render more to his neighbour than hee oweth yet never any man redreth to god all that hee oweth
aristotle said well

that to god and ou parents wee cannot render as they deserve of us especially to god
for as pereris a learned iesuire saith

besides the debs or duties of thankeflnesse which none can sufficiently render unto god those debts also which by gods commandements we are bound to discharge no man perfectly dischargeth
wee therefore being no way able to render what is due to god but on the contrary by our innes making our elves debtours to him owing unto him deserved punishment is it any lesse than antichristian insolencie or rather blasphmy for infull men to professe themselves ale to merit any good thing at the hands of god and to make him their debtour neither can ufficiently wonder how men whose conscience if it be not cauterized doth tell them that they sinne daily against god and by sinne provoke his judgements can speake or thinke of meriting any thing injustice at the hand of god but punishment
for as

augustine faith si deus velle pr meritis agere non inveniret isi quos damaret
if god would deale according to merits he should finde none but whom he should condemne



if it be said that the lord by promising any thing maketh

himselfe a debtour for the performance of it
answer first with augustine

he is become a debtour not by receiving any thing of us but by promising what hee pleased and therefore no debtour to us
for god is not debtour to any not so much as by covenant for hee covenanteth non de debit sed de gratui· not for rendring a due debt but for freely bestowing his owne free gift nor according to debt

but according to grace
to whom hen should he be a debtour by his promise

answer in the second place with

thomas that the lord who is faithfull and just in performing his promises maketh himselfe a debtor not to us but to himselfe for the gracious performance of his free and undeserved reward which hee had freely and graciously promised
thirdly with bonaventre he hath made himself a debtor not to men to whom he could owe nothing but to himselfe that he might bee faithfull in his promises
for if god be a debtour to man then debet dare ei vitam aeternam then hee ought to give him eternall life
but hoc verbum debet venem hbet saith the

master of the sentences therefore saith hee ratio debiti secundùm quod obligationem dicit propriè in deo non cadi

some famous writers saith cassader among whom is

durandu deny that god by his promise is bound to us

fourthly gods fidelity and justice in giving the reward according to his promise that is to say freely doth not argue our merit but gods trueth who annot lie nor deny himselfe

fifthly that reward which is due onely ratione pacti is not deserved ratione operis and that which is rendred

non redditur ex debito operis sed ex promissione
and therefore as it was freely promised so it is freely and undeservedly given


xi· secondly in the party that is to merit it is requisite that

he should be his owne man ad not the other parties man of whom he would merit
for if he be his all that hee can doe is duety not merit
nay as hee is not his owne man but his lords so his workes are not his owne and for his owne advantage but for his master
et quicquid suo labore acquirit saith bellarmine domino suo acquirit non sibi and whatsoever he getteth by his labour he getteth it for his lord not for himselfe
but wee are all the servnts of the lord not onely by right of creation but also of redemption in regard whereof wee are not our owne men but his that bought us
cor


and therefore a servant when hee hath done his duety deserveth not so much as thankes of his lord luke

even so when we have done all that is commanded which wee are never able to doe but our saviour speaketh by way of supposition wee must confesse that wee are unprofitable servants we have done but what our duety was to doe and indeed not so much


xii thirdly the thing by which a man should merit ought to bee thus qualified
first that which meriteth quatenus meretur it must be our owne and from our selves and not his nor from him of

whom wee would merit
but all our good workes as they are good and as the papists hold them and all those virtues and graces which we have with their uses are not our owne as from our selves but they are the free gifts

and graces of god

moritò debetur merces to merit wages is due saith

bellarmine debitum autem non oritur nisi ex quòd unus dat alteri quod sum era
nam si rem non suam sed alienam daret nihil ei deberetu
now debt ariseh not but from this that one man giveth to another that which is his owne for if he should give any thing which is not his owne but the other mans nothing should be due unto him

origen

vix mihi suadeo ullum opus esse posse quod ex debito remunerationem dei depscat cum etiam hoc ipsum quod agere aliquid possumus vel cogitare vel proloqui ipsius dono largitione faciamus
can hardly perswade my selfe that there can bee any workes which can require as debt a reward from god seeing also even this that wee can doe or thinke or speake any thing we doe it by his gift and bounty

dona dei non merentur apud deum gods gifts doe not merit of god
by them perhaps we may merit of others but not of him who gave them for it is against sense that the doer should by the gift received from the doner merit of him
all the good that a man hath is from god

and by consequent god cannot owe any thing to man
gods gifts are his merits of us not ours of him
it is strange that by his gifts hee should bee obliged to give more
as if by the receit or use of an hundred pounds we should merit a thousand

non talia sunt hominum merita saith

bernard ut propter a vita erna debeatur ex merita omnia dei dona sunt it a homo magis propter ipsa do debior est quàm deus homini

anastatius scinaita for when we shall offer all the good things whatsoever we have he doth not owe to us a reward for all are his
but no man receiving his owne things is a debtor to give a reward to them who offer unto him the same

whereunto will adde that of

durandus both that which we are and that also which we have whether they be good acts or good habits or uses all is in us from the liberality of god freely giving and conserving
and because by a free gift none is bound to give more but the receiver rather is more bound to the giver wherefore by the good habits good acts and uses given unto of god god is not obliged to us out of any debt of justice to give more as if he did not give he should be unjust but we rather are obliged to god
and it is a rash or blasphemous thing to thinke or speake the contrary

if it be said that by the good use of gods gifts wee may deserve greater answere that as the good gift it selfe so the good use of it is also the free gift of god which if god reward hee doth not reward our merits but crowne his owne gifts as agustine often

speaketh


xiii
secondly that which meriteth is free not onely from

the necessity of coaction which condition the papists acknowledge but also of duety for quod est debitum non est meritum that which is duty is not merit
in rendring that which is due wee may satisfie perhaps our debt but not merit reward
this is a certaine trueth if the worke bee due the reward is not due ratione operis for the workes sake

quid meriti apud deum poterimus obtrudere qui debemus omnia how can wee plead merit before god who owe him all things of that which we doe owe we are not owners the money which is owed is aes alienum nihil propriè nostrum est nisi quod pro arbitrio possumus facere vel omittere saith

bellarmine nothing is properly our owne but that which we can upon free choise doe or omit

all the good things which wee can doe are due from us to god luk

so that if we should doe all that is commanded we were but unprofitable servants because we have but done that which was our duety to doe
but indeed wee doe not nor cannot performe all that is due so farre are we from merit
againe there is no good thing which wee can doe but it is commanded of god and therefore due
not to doe it is a sinne to doe it is not merit but duety

saint

bernard doth demonstrate for many causes that all our good workes are due unto god saith

bellarmin so that he may exact them all though he would give no reward

if thou didst know saith

bernard how many things and to how many thou doest owe thou shouldst see how they are nothing which thou doest and how not to bee reckoned among the least in comparison of thy debts

all that thou art thou owest to him from whom thou hast all
and after who then will grumble any more saying wee labour too much wee fast too much wee watch too much when hee is not able to answere the thousand yea not the least part of his debts
object
but it will be said doth not he well that payeth his debt answ
in not paying it hee should sinne but in paying hee satisfieth onely his debt he doth not merit a new reward


xiv thirdly that worke which meriteth must bee pure and

perfect and not stained with any corruptions and imperfections for otherwise it will not so much as satisfie our debt but rather make us obnoxious unto punishment every defect and imperfection being a sinne and much lesse will it merit at the hands of god eternall life
but all our best obedience is unperfect and stained with the flesh as have heretofore proved at large all our righteousnesses being as polluted cloutes

gregory saith omne virtutis nostrae meritum esse vitium

object

yea but the imperfection is taken away by the bloud of christ
answ
where is remission of sinne there can bee no merit of condignity

object

veniall sinnes may stand with perfect righteousnesse

answ
true in respect of imputed righteousnesse by which sinnes are made veniall but in regard of inherent righteousnesse it is absurd
fourthly that which meriteth is more than is due for debitum non est meritum for debt is not merit but all that we can performe is lesse than that which is due

xv
the thing that we are to merit that is to say the reward first it must bee proportionable to the merit
for justice standeth in equality

but betweene the best works or sufferings of this life yea martyrdome it selfe and eternall life there is no proportion
for the one is finite the other infinite as being the everlasting fruition of god the infinite and chiefe good
wherefore

bernard quid sunt saith he omnia merita ad tantam gloriam what are all merits to so great glory and

augustin how great labor is that rest worthy of which hath no end
if you will make a true comparison and judge truely eternall rest is rightly bought with eternall labour for eternall

rest eternall labor should have been undertaken
thou who art to receive eternall happinesse thou oughtest to beare eternall our labour and tribulations were for a thousand yeares weigh a thousand yeares with eternity
why doest thou weigh that which is infinite with a thing that is finite be it never so great

non valent vitae praesentis obsequia aeternae vit gaudiis comparari

tantum ubi gratiae divinae retributionis exuberat ut incomparabiliter ineffabiliter mne meritum qvis bon ex deo datae humanae voluntatis operationis excedat

secondly it should bee due upon just desert and not bee given of grace rom

the given to the worke of one houre is from bounty
matth


but eternall life is given freely by gods grace rom


of the wicked

chrysostome saith undefined span alphabet these are justly punished but of the godly undefined span alphabet]· and they are crowned according to grace
undefined span alphabet
for although they should performe ten thousand workes it is the

munificence of grace that for such small and vile workes such an heaven and kingdome and so great an honour should be given them

thirdly the rule by which rewardis rendred to condigne merits is not meere grace but justice and that either commutativè which

standeth in equality or distributivè which respecteth dignity the former· observing an arithmeticall the other a geometricall proportion
but neither is their equality betweene he merit and the reward

neither are the things which wee doe or suffer condigne or any way comparable to the glory that shall bee revealed
but the reward of eternall life is given of meere grace in respect of us rom

according to the good pleasure of god luke

who

crowneh us with mercies psal

for by grace we are saved and not by workes ephes


now we must remember that that grace is not grace any way which is not gracious every way

non enim gratia dei gratia erit ullo modo nisi fuerit gratuita omni modo


xvi
these conditions of merit whereof none agreeth to our workes as have shewed all of them are found in christs meritorious obedience both active and passive
the three first because our saviour was and is both god and man
the fourth with all the foure branches thereof for first it was his owne and from himselfe
mereri jus est saith hilarie

qui sibi ipse meriti acquirendi author existat
for although what he had he had from god yet he had his power of meriting not from an externall principle but from himselfe as being god not by grace but by nature and by generation
secondly it was libera non debita free and not of duety because he is god
esa

oblatus est quia ipse voluit ioh

thirdly it was most perfect absolute
the seventh because it was more than hee did owe
the eighth because his merits are of infinite valew and therefore condigne to the glorie which shall be revealed
insomuch that pope clement whom bellarmine

doth follow did not sticke to say guttam unam sanguinis christi propter infinitam personae dignitatem ad totius mundi redemptionem sufficere ptuisse
the ninth because by his sufferings the justice of god is fully satisfied and by his obedience heaven is merited for us even according to the rule of justice

but not one of the nine conditions agreeth to the obedience and sufferings of any mortall man
therefore not the obedience of any meere man is truely and properly meritorious but onely the obedience of christ to whom alone merit is properly to be ascribed
to these reasons we may adde all those arguments which produced either to prove that we are not justified by any righteousnesse inherent or that we are not justified nor saved by works which arguments for number were many and for strength impregnable but especially those which did prove either that all our obedience is defective and stayned with the flesh or that wee are not able perfectly to fulfill the law of god
for if our obedience be unperfect and defective then is it farre from meriting any thing but punishment
and if wee bee not able to lfill the law then are wee in our selves subject to the curse of the law so farre are wee from meriting heaven by our owne obedience

chap
viii
testimonies of scripture disproving merits vindicated from bellarmines cavills


now come to testimonies of scriptures and first those which bellarmine by his sophistry seeketh

to wring from us
and first wee alleage those testimonies which ascribe the reward of good workes to gods mercie and not to our merits
as exod

psalm




gal


mat

but more specially tit

eph

from whence we argue thus

that which is freely given of gods meere mercie and grace is not rendred to our merits as deserved thereby and whatsoever is rendred as due to our merits that is not given of grace
eternall life is freely given of gods meere mercie and grace which is proved by the testimonies alleaged
therefore it is not rendred ro our merits as deserved thereby

to the proposition bellarmine seemeth to answere or rather to the conclusion that eternall life though it bee rendred to our merits yet is given of gods free mercie
but the proposition is generally true
for to him that worketh and by his work meriteth the reward is given not according to grace but according to debt rom
and such is the opposition between merit and grace that what is of grace is not of works and what is of workes is not of grace rom

omne meritum saith aquinas

repugnat gratiae
and bellarmine himselfe

gratia inde nmen accepit quod gratis detur oppnitur autem debito
likewise bernard

non est quo gratia intret ubi iam meritum occupavit
and againe deest gratiae quicquid meritis deputas so that grace and workes mercie and merit cannot stand together
if therefore eternall life be of workes it is not of grace and if of merit then not of mercie


ii
yea but bellarmine will prove that eternall life is to bee ascribed

both to gods mercie and our merit by two expositions which he saith augustine

giveth of the places alleaged the one wherein he joyneth gregory

with him
that eternall life though it bee the due reward of merits yet it is called gratia because the merits themselves to which it is rendred are the free gifts of grace
whereunto reply that the assertions both of augustine and also of gregory make strongly against the

merit of condignity
for if eternall life be called grace as he faith because it is freely given and the good workes which he unproperly calleth

merits be also the free gifts of god how is it possible that eternall life should bee rendred to them as a deserved reward it be freely given how is it rendred as a debt if good works be gods free gifts they mke us debtours to god not him to us
augustine in that epistle cited by bellarmiue saith

debita redditur poena damnato indebita gratia liberato ut nec ille se indignum queratur nec dignum se iste autem gratia nullis utique meritis reddita sed gratuita bonitate donata
and againe ipsa vita nuncupatur nec ob aliud nisi quia gratis detur
and yet againe
quaerimus meritum misericordiae nec invenimus quia nullum est ne gratia evacuetur si non gratis donatur sed meritis redditur
augustine therefore speaketh of good workes as the free gifts of gods grace and therefore not merits properly but onely such workes as god will freely reward bellarmine himselfe being the interpreter and of eternall life hee speaketh as the free and undeserved reward of good workes quae gratia nuncupatur non ob aliud nisi quia gratis datur
eternall life is called grace for no other respect but because it is freely given
the same augustine

writing on those words of psalm


melior est misericordia super vitas saith multae sunc vitae humanae sed deus unam vitam promittis non illam dat nobis quasi propter merita nostra sed proper misericordiam suam
gregory

writing on those words psal

cause me to heare thy mercie in the morning where by morning he understandeth the future resurrection wherein gods mercy shall be shewed towards the faithfull hee frameth this objection
if that felicity of the saints bee mercie and is not acquired by merits what shall become of that which is written and thou shalt render to every one according to his workes if it be rendred according to works how shall it be accounted mercie whereunto he giveth two answeres both of them making against merit
the first sed aliud est secundum opera reddere aliud propter ipsa operareddere
it is one thing to render according to workes another to render for the workes themselves for in that which is said according to workes the quality of the workes is meant that whose workes shall appeare to be good his retribution may be glorious according to workes therefore is according to the quality of them whether

good or evill
for if good then he will reward them with blisse if evill then will he condemne them
for to that blessed life saith he wherein we live with god and of god no labour can bee matched no works can be compared especially seeing the apotle saih the sufferings of this life are not condigne to the future glory which shall be revealed in us
his other answere howbeit in this respect also it may be called mercie because it is given for such workes as no man can attaine unto without mercie
it is evident therefore saith hee that to whom god in mercie giveth grace to worke well in this life to them in greater mercie he granteth that in eternall blisse they shall be rewarded with an hundred fold this is that grace which for grace the apostle saith shall bee given to the saints of god that unto whom in this life the grace of sanctification is given of god to them the grace of eternall happinesse is given in the life to come which also maketh strongly

against merits· both because eternall life is a free gift and also because that righteousnesse to which it is given is a free gift and because greater mercie is shewed in giving glory than in giving gracc


iii
the second exposition which he assigneth to augustine is a

fiction of his owne braine viz that in the crowning of the saints mercie is necessary for the remission of veniall sinnes
not that ths mercie saith hee is the crowne of life but because it doth accompany it the crowne of life being given to their merits and the remission granted to their venial offences which fiction as it is falsely fathered upon aug so it is not agreeable to the doctrine of the church of rome nor consonant to the truth it self
for seeing in the faithful sin according to the truth both in respect of the guilt and also of the corruption is wholly taken away in the end of this life or according to the church of romes doctrine is purged and taken away by the fire of purgatory it is a grea absurdity to imagine that the faithful whose soules before the resurrection enjoy as they also teach the beatifical vision should after the resurrection need remission of venial sins


iv
for our second argument bellarmine propoundeth in our behalfe two object
out of esa

and dan


which he saith might

be made
the former wherof is availeable against the merit of grace not only the first which he confesseth· but the second also and not onely against merit of grace but of glory for that also is promised without price the later against affiance reposed in our own merits
for if we are not to trust in them for the obtaining of temporall benefits wherof bellar understands the prophet to speak then much lesse eternall between which and our supposed merits there is a farre geater disproportion


our third argument is aken out of luk



which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattell will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field
goe and sitdown to meat and wil not rather say unto him make ready wherwith may sup and gird thy selfe and serve me till have eaten and drunken and afterwards thou shalt eate and drink
doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him row not
so likewise you when you shal hve done all these things which are commanded you which is spoken by supposition and is all one with this connexive if you shall doe all things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants wee have done that which was our duety to doe
which place affordeth three unanswerable arguments against the merit of condignity· taken from three of those conditions required in merits which before were mentioned
the first in respect of god who is our absolute lord
the second in respect of us who are his bondservants the third in respect of our workes because all that we can doe though we should doe all that is commanded is but our duety


vi
for the first if earthly masters who with their servants are fellow· servants to one heavenly master doe not owe so much as thanks to their servants for doeing that which they command then much lesse

our heavenly master who is our absolut lord doth owe the heavenly reward to his servants when they do that which hee commandeth

though they should doe all that is commanded which they are never able to doe

for the second bondservants who are not their owne but their masters men for a servant as the philosopher saith is undefined span alphabet and altogether his man another mans man doe owe themselves and all that they can doe to their master and cannot deserve so much as thankes at his hands for doing what hee commandeth though

they doe all that is commanded and although their service be profitable to their master and finally though they receive not from him either the will or power of yeelding obedience to him but all that they can desire or expect by their uttermost endevour is to be undefined span alphabet wll pleasing to their master when if their service be any way defective are wel apayed if they escape the whip as

theophylact speaketh how much lese wee who are the lords mancipia and bondservants both by the right of creation and by the right of redemption being in regard thereof servi quia servati and consequently not our owne men but his who hath made and redeemed us and therefore doe owe our selves and all yea more than all we can doe doe wee or can we deserve at the hands of god the reward of eternall life by doing what he commandeth though we should doe all that is commanded which we never doe especially seeing and also seeming that wee doe not all that is commanded and lastly seeing that our service bringth him no profit iob



for that which we doe wee receive both the will and power from him
wherefore all that in reason we can desire or expect in regard of our obedience is that wee may bee well pleasing unto him
yea forasmuch as our service is alwayes defective and unperfect wee ought to thinke our selves mercifully

dealt with if wee escape the punishment which by the law of god is due unto us
but here it will bee said if the master shall bee pleased to promise rewards unto the servant for his service well performed may not the servant expect the promised reward answere that what reward soever shll in this kinde be either promised or given it is wholly to be ascribed to the masters bounty and not to the servants merit


vii
for the third that which is done of meere duty by a servant to his lord there belongeth no reward in justice as deserved by him
but all that we who are the servants of god can doe though we should doe all that is commanded is done of meere bounden duety to our lord
therefore to all that we can doe though we should doe all that is commanded there belongeth no reward as justly deserved by us
but when we have done all that is commanded speak by supposition as our saviour doth we must no lesse truely than humbly confesse that wee are unprofitable servants that is as is manifestly gathered out of the parable such as cannot deserve so much as thankes of our lord
if therefore our gracious lord shall be pleased out of his bounty freely to promise and according to his promise graciously to reward our imperfect obedience which he might justly

punish it is not our merit but his great mercie that he doth not punish it more that he doth accept of it as well pleasing unto him in his welbeloved but most of all that he doth most graciously and undeservedly reward it
from whence reason thus

whosoever are unprofitable servants they doe not merit no deserve the reward of eternall life of their lord

all the faithfull though they should doe all that is commanded are unprofitable servants therefore none of the faithfull though they should doe all that is commanded doe merit or deserve at the hands of god the reward of eternall life
and if they who doe all that is commanded cannot merit then much lesse they whose obedience is defective as the obedience even of the best is
so saith hierome

si inutilis est qui fecit omnia quid de illo dicendum qui explerenon potuit


viii
the assumption is proved first because our saviour

commandeth his apostles to confesse as the truth is that when they have done all that is commanded they are unprofitable servants and therefore they who neither doe nor can doe all are impudent lyars when they professe themselves to be profitable servants
secondly by a comparison of earthly lords and servants
for if earthly lords and masters owe not so much as thankes to their servants who are indeed their fellow servants for all the service which they can doe though they doe not give them the will and the power to doe them acceptable service how much lesse doth god who being our absolute lord doth also give us will and power to serve him owe unto his servants the reward of the kingdome of heaven and if servants by doing all possible service to their earthly masters who are but their fellow servants cannot deserve so much as thankes at their hands how much lesse can wee who serve the lord of lords deserve the kingdome of heaven at his hands by our unperfect and defective service of him
thirdly from the antithesis or opposition that is betweene debitum and meritm duety and merit
for hee that doth but his duety though he performe his whole duty cannot merit a reward of his master but must confesse himselfe to be an unprofitable servant how much lesse can they merit an heavenly reward at the hands of god who performe not their whole duty but faile in many particulars both by omission and commission as the very best of us doe


ix
to avoid the force of this unavoidable argument bellarmine

seeketh many evaions which he would gladly father upon the fathers of the church
for he saith there be foure egregious expositions given by the fathers none whereof make against the merit of good workes
the first of saint ambrose

that of our selves and by nature we are unprofitable servants apt and unable to fulfill gods commandements

which our saviour would have us humbly to acknowledge though by grace we become profitable and therefore as he saith agnoscenda est gratia sed non ignoranda natura
reply ambrose doth not speake

of our corrupt nature neither is it his meaning that by nature wee are unprofitable servants by grace profitable but that by nature wee are servants and by grace sonnes
for by nature corrupted wee are not the servants of god but of sinne and satan
but he understandeth the meaning of our saviour to be that the children of god who are in the state of grace should not glory in their workes as if by them they did merit any thing of god quia jure domino debemus obsequium
because by right we owe obedience to god
neither should we thinke our selves exempted from continued obedience because we are sonnes for as we are sons by the grace of adoption which we are to acknowledge so by nature and creation whereof we are not to be ignorant we are servants
as therefore thou who art a master dost not content thy selfe with one worke of thy servant and then biddest him sit downe and eate but having done one worke thou exactest of him another vers
so god doth not require the use of one worke in thee but whiles we live we must alwaies work
secondly our saviour doth not speake of naturall men as being unprofitable because unapt to fulfill gods commandements but directeth his speech to the faithfull and namely to his owne apostles and disciples who study and endeavour to keepe all gods commandements which without grace cannot be done requiring them to make this humble and true confession that even when they have done all that is commanded they are but unprofitable servants such as are described in the parable who deserve nothing at the hands of their master because in doing all that is commanded they doe but their bounden duty and that excludeth merit
for debitum non est meritum

yea but bellarmine proveth out of tim


that by grace men

become profitable to god
for he that purgeth himselfe shall become a vessell profitable unto the lord
answ
the greek is undefined span alphabet fit for the master of the house to use for the benefit of the houshold and fitted for every good worke
but that our piety or obedience bringeth no profit to god have shewed before
and this is the very second exposition of this place which though repugnant to this present assertion bellarmine himselfe doth commend in the second place
for so hee saith



we are commanded as bede expoundeth this text to acknowledge that we bring no profit to god but that what good thing soever wee doe is profitable to our selves but not to god
reply beda giveth two reasons though bellarmine conceale the better why we doing that which is commanded are notwithstanding called unprofitable servants
the former quia dominus bonorum nostrorum non indiget because the lord hath no need of our good things
which though true yet doth neither so well fit the comparison wherein the servant though usefull to his master both abroad and at home could not by all his endevour deserve to himselfe so much as thankes· neither agreeable to the reason which our saviour rendreth because we have one what is our duty to doe

the latter we are unprofitable servants because saith he non sunt

condignae
the sufferings of this life are not worthy of the glory that shall be reavealed that is because we cannot deserve the reward of eternall life by our service
but as it is elswhere said saith he who crowneth thee in mercie and loving kindenesse hee doth not say in thy merits and workes because by whose mercie wee are prevented that we may in humility serve god by his gift we are crowned that in sublimity we may reigne with him
so bede


xi
the third exposition he saith is augustines viz
that

we may be called unprofitable servants when we have kept all gods commandements because we doe no more than our duty which indeed is the reason which christ himselfe doth render neither can wee from thence demand

any just reward unlesse god had made a liberall covenant with us
for by our condition we are the of god and if he will he may bind us to performe all manner of workes as it pleaseth him without reward
this our condition christ for the preservation of humility would have us to acknowledge
howbeit by his gracious covenant we may expect reward tim


matth


which god in his great bounty hath promised to this end that thereby he might draw us to performance of our duety as augustine teacheth

replpy this answere of bellaamine is worthy to be observed or rather admired first for the impudencie of it in that he fathereth this exposition upon augustine who in the place by him quoted doth not once mention this text of luk

nor hath one word to that purpose for which this exposition is alleaged excepting the clause of gods bounty which as it proveth this to bee that very testimony of augustine which he quoteth so doth it evidently exclude merit
secondly for the force of truth which forceth him to contradict his owne assertions both here and in other places
for first hee confesseth that hee which doth no more but his duty doth not merit and that wee doe no more but our duty
whereupon it followeth that we doe not merit
secondly where hee confesseth that wee can doe no more than our duty he renounceth all workes of supererrogation
and thirdly in that he confesseth that for the same cause wee are unprofitable servants he taketh away all merit of condignity
fourthly he confesseth that without gods gracious promise we could expect no reward
which proveth that the reward is due onely ratione pacti and not ratione ipsius operis which afterward he denyeth
fifthly he confesseth that such is the bounty and goodnesse of god that to allure us to the performance of our duty hee doth freely promise a reward
now what god doth freely promise to give he giveth freely and without desert
for eternall life which in his word hee hath promised as a reward in his eternall counsell hee purposed freely without any respect of our worthynesse to bestow upon us and what in mercy hee either purposed or promised christ by his merit hath purchased for us
so that we attaine to heaven by a threefold right
by gods free donation electing us in christ as his free gift
secondly by christs merit as our inheritance thirdly by gods free

promise as his gracious reward whereby he crowneth not our merits but his owne gifts and graces in us
god indeed hath promised freely to reward our workes but that our workes should merit the reward he hath no where promised or taught


xii
his fourth exposition is of chrysostome that the lord doth not say ye are unprofitable servants but biddeth them say so which is true
but what will bellarmine inferre therefrom that therefore they were not so god forbid for then our saviour should have taught his disciples to lye
neither doth god allow of counterfeit humility
but the meaning of our saviour was to teach his disciples in humility to confesse the truth that because they had but done their duty if they had done all that is commanded they should not bee lifted up with a proud conceite that thereby they had merited but should no lesse truly than humbly confesse that they were unprofitable servants who by doing no more than their duty could not merit of god
and this objection is also answered by

bernard
sed hoc inquies propter humilitatem monuit omne dicendum
planè propter humilitatem numquid contra veritatem but you will say that for humility sake hee admonisheth them thus to say
no doubt for humilitie
but did hee bid them speake against verity and the same is taught by

chrysostome elsewhere
no man saith hee doth shew foorth such a conversation as to be worthy of the kingdome but it is wholly of his gift therefore hee saith when you shall doe all that is commanded say we are unprofitable servants we have done what is our duty to doe
and againe in another place where he sheweth that what the sonne of god did for us hee did not of duty

but what good we doe wee doe it of duty
wherefore himselfe said when you shall have done all say ye are unprofitable servants for wee have done what was our duty to doe
if therefore wee shew foorth love if we give our goods to the poore we performe our duty

object
yea but the servants

which imployed their talents well were commended as profitable servants
answ
they were commended as good servants and faithfull to their master
and of him because they profitably imployed their talents were graciouslie rewarded
but of their merit nothing is said
if they had not imployed their talents well they should have beene punished
and in that they did imploy them well they did but their duty and that also by assistance of gods grace who both gave them the talents and grace to imploy them well and therefore though they had reward yet they did not merit it


xiii
our fourth testimonie is rom

for the stipend

of sinne is death but the free gift of god is eternall life through iesvs christ our lord where is an antitheis or opposition betweene death meaning eternall death the reward of sinne and eternall life the reward of righteousnesse that death is the stipend of sinne justly merited by it but eternall life is not a stipend or wages merited by us but undefined span alphabet the free gift of god which is a

most pregnant place for if the apostle had supposed eternall life to be a stipend or wages or merited reward he would have said that as death is the stipend of sinne so eternall life is the stipend of righteousnesse
but the apostle making an opposition between the reward of sinne and the reward of righteousnesse saith that the one is undefined span alphabet a military stipend due to those who serve under satans colours the other is not a stipend or wages deserved but undefined span alphabet the free gift of god
undefined span alphabet signifieth a military stipend or wages due to souldiers
as when iohn baptist biddeth the souldiers to bee content undefined span alphabet with their stipend luke

so cor

for as augustine saith

quod est merces operanti hoc militanti stipendium and worthily saith hee is death called a stipendium

quia militiae diabolicae mors aeterna tanquam debitum redditur

the word undefined span alphabet which the vulgar latine translateth gratia signifieth a free gift not rendred as due to the merit of the receiver but vouchsafed freely out of the free bounty and undeserved favour of the giver
for as primasius saith

non est gratia si non gratis datur si debita merentibus redditur quod absit and augustine

non erit dei gratia ullo modo nisi gratuita fuerit omni modo wherefore it is called gratia that we may understand it is of grace and not not of merits
the verbe undefined span alphabet whence it is derived signifieth freely to bestow to gratifie or graciously to give
and therefore is eternall life called undefined span alphabet because god undefined span alphabet doth freely bestow it
the argument standeth thus
a free gift which is opposed to stipend or wages is not merited by us
eternall life is the free gift of god and is opposed to stipend or wages therefore it is not merited by us


xiv bellarmine answereth that augustine hath diligently answered

this argument epist

enchirid ap
but chiefly in libro de gratia lib arb cap


from whence hee gathereth two assertions
first that the apostle might well have said eternall life is the stipend of righteousnesse even as he said the stipend of sinne is death which confession of augustine cutteth the thrat hee saith of our assertion
scondly that the apostle did not say eternall life is the stipend of righteousnesse as he said death is the stipend of sinne least any man should thinke that we so have righteousnesse of ourselves as we have sinne of our selves therefore eternall life is called grace not because it is not the reward of merit but that we have the merits themselves from grace

to the former reply that when augustine saith that eternall life might well be called a stipend which hee maketh to bee all one with merces hee meaneth a stipend or reward freely given as if there were stipendium gratitum as well as merces gratuita
and that this was his meaning demonstrate out of the same places which bellarmine doth quote and first out of epist

debita redditur pna demnato indebita gratia liberato nec ille se indignum queratur nc dignum se iste glorietur
si antem gratia atque null is meritis reddits sed gratuita bnitate aterna vita gratia nuncupatur nn ob alid nisi quia gratis datur

secondly enchirid cap

ipsam vitam aeternam quae certa merces est operum bonorum gratiam dei appellat apostolus stipendium enim inquit pccatimors gratia autem dei vita aeterna in christo iesu domin nstro· stipendium pro opere militiae debitum redditur non donatur
idò dixit stipendium peccatimors ut mortem peccato non immeritò illatam sed debitam demonstraret
gratia verò nisi gratis sit gratia non est

thirdly praefat in psal
merces nostra gratia vocatur figrati est gratis datur quid est gratis datur gratis reddatur tibi quod debetur puniendus es quid ergò fit non tibi deus rddit debitam poenam sed donat indebitam gratiam
fourthly degratia lib arbitr cap

cum apostolus prius dixisset stipendium peccatimrs merit inquit stipendium quia militiae diabolicae mors aeterna tanquam debitum redditur
vbi cum posset dicere rectè dicere stipendium autem justitiae vita aeterna maluit dicere gratia autem dei vita aetern ut hinc intelligamus non meritis nostris deum nos ad aeternam vitam sed pro sua miseratione perducere
whereby it appeareth that although hee saith that eternall life may bee called a stipend yet hee meaneth not a stipend or wages deserved or merited by us but a reward freely given us of god


xv
and as the former assertion maketh not against us so the

later maketh wholly for us against both the pelagians and the papists
the pelagians held that their good workes were done not by the helpe of grace but by the strength of their owne free will and so in that respect a reward was due unto them whereas they who bring forth good workes ex don gratiae had neither commendation nor merit
against them augustine in many places disputeth proving that eternall life which is the reward of our good workes is called by the apostle gratia not onely because it selfe is freely given but also because the good workes whereof it is the reward are to be ascribed to gods grace
and that therefore the lord when he rewardeth the godly life of the faithfull with eternall life hee giveth them gratiam progratia and that when he rewardeth our merits thereby meaning our good workes hee doth crowne not our merits but his owne graces
thus hee writeth epist


omne meritum nostrum non in nobis facit nisi gratia cum deus cronat merit nstra nihil aliud quàm muner su sict enim ab initio fidei misericordiam consecuti sumus non quia fideles eramus sed ut esseus sic in fin quod erit in vita aeterna cronabit nos sicut scriptum est

in miseratione ipsa vita aeterna qu utique in fine sine fine habebitur ideò merit is praecedentibus redditur tamen qui eadem merita quibus redditur non nobis parata sunt per nstram sufficientiam sed in nobis facta per gratim etiam ipsa grtia nuncupatur non ob aliud nii quia gratis datur nec ideò qui meritis non datur sed quia data sunt

ipsa merita quibus datur

stipendium peccati mors rectè stipendium quia debetur quia dignè retribuitur quia merit redditur
deinde ne justiti de humanose extolleret sicut humanum meritum malum non dubitatur esse peccatum non contra

retulit dicens ipendium justitiae vita terna haec ne praeter mediatorem aliqua alia via quaereretur adjecit in christo iesu domino nostro tanquam diceret audit quod stipndium peccai sit mors quid te disponis extollere humana non justitia sed nomine justitiae planè superbi quid te disponis extollere ac contrariam morti vitam aeternam tanquam dbitum stipendium flagitare

quaprpter homo si accepturus es vitam aeternam justitiae quidem stipendium est sed tibi gratia est cui gratia ipsa justitia
tibi enim tanquam dbita reddereur si ex tetibi esset justiti cui debetr
nunc igitur de plenitudine ejus accepimus non slum gratiam qua nunc justè in laboribus usque in finem vivimus sed etiam gratiam pro hac gratia ut in requie postea sine fine vivamus

intelligendum est igitur etiam ipsa hominis bna merita esse dei munera quibus cum vita aeternae redditur quid isi gratia pro gratia redditur

vita bona nostra nihil aliud est quam dei gratia sine dubi vita eterna quae bonae vitae reàditur dei gratia est
et ipsa enim gratis datur quia gratis data est illa datur
sed illa cui datur tantummod gratia est haec autem quae illi datur quniam praemium ejus est grtia est prgratia tanquam merces pro justiia

that which augustine speaketh of the grace of justification is true of all grace

quomod est gratia si ex debito redditur how is it grace if it be rendred of duety


xi
the papists when thy are pressed with the authority of saint augustine would seeme to differ much from the pelagians but it is more in shew than in trueth
for they doe hold the merit of congruity and that grace is given to men according to their owne preparations

and dispositions and that the efficacy of grace when it is offered is so to bee ascribed to our owne free will as that it is in our owne power either to accept or reject it
for this

alphonsus a castro setteh downe as a catholike assertion that when god hath stirred up our will to that which is good it is in the power of mans will either to assent to gods monition or to dissent
ex hc autem qud nos monitioni illius consentimus qui tamen dissentire pteramus debetur nobis merces precium inde meritum nostrum
and so our rhemists that those whom god pardoneth worke by their owne free will and thereby deserve their owne salvation
if therefore the grace of righteousnesse or the grace of glory be deserved by us both which the papists teach the former by merit of congruity the latter by merit of condignity then contrary to augustines assertion neither the one nor the other is to bee called grace
for that hee denieth to bee truely called grace which is not omni odo gratuita
so much concerning augustines exposition now let us search the judgements of some others of the fathers


xvii

tertullian interpreteth this text thus stipendi delinquentiae

mrs donativum autem dei vita aeterna in christ iesu domino nostro

origen benè autem metaphram figuram militiae ex initio propositam

servat ut militantibus sub peccati debita mortem dicat exolvi
deum verò non erat dignum militibus suis stipendia tanquam aliquod debitum dare sed donum gratiam quae est vita aeterna in christo iesu domino nostro
the same hath

sedulius

hierome stipendia peccati mors qui peccato militat remunerationem accipit autem dei vita aeterna non dixit similiter stipendia enim nostro labore quaesita est sed dei munere condonata

chrysostome the apostle having spoken of the wages of sinne concerning the good he doth not observe the same order for hee did not say undefined span alphabet the wages of your good deeds but the free gift of god shewing that they were not delivered of themselves nor received undefined span alphabet a due debt nor retribution or remuneration of their labours but that all things came to them by grace

theodoret worthily he called death undefined span alphabet a military stipend but here saith hee upon those words gratia autem dei he doth not say wages but grace for eternall life is the gift of god
for although a man should performe very great and absolute righteousnesse yet temporall labours are not equivalent to eternall blessings

phoius undefined span alphabet
he said not the wages of your good workes but the free gift of god

theophylact sinne to its servants for a reward of their service rendreth death but that which is to come from god hee calleth grace and not reward as if hee should say for you receive not the wages of your labours but by grace all these things happen to you in christ who worketh these things

haymo what is it that speaking of the reward of sinne calleth it stipend but of the remuneration of the elect he calleth it the grace of god
for they that goe to warfare receive their owne wages but whatsoever the elect have they receive it wholly from the grace of god whether they have faith or charity or any good worke and moreover for this grace of faith and good workes gratis accipiunt they freely receive eternall life
and the same hath rhemigius

and to these you may adde two famous cardinals the one

cajetan hee doth not say that the stipend of righteousnesse is eternall life but the gift of god is eternall life that we may understand that not by our merits but by the free gift of god we attaine to eternall life for the end
the other

contarenus it is here to bee noted saith

hee that the apostle signifieth that death is due to sinne in justice for so much the name stipend doth import but that eternall life is

of the free gift of god


xiii
our fifth testimony is rom

which our rhemists

according to the vulgar latine read thus
for thinke that the passions of this time are not condigne to the glory to come that shall be revealed in us which words so translated non condignae or as

ambrose and

augustine in many places read indign are a direct contradiction

to the merit of condignity
neither ought they to cavill at our former translations which reade they are not worthy
for what is their non condignae or ambrose and augustines indignae but not worthy or unworthy
and what is it not to be worthy or to be unworthy but not to deserve yea bellarmine himselfe both in his second and third chapters

endevoureth to prove merit from all those places where the word worthy is used for dignum esse praemio saith he mereri pr aemium idem sunt bee worthy of reward and to deserve it are all one
therefore according to this translation which with the papists is the onely authenticall text of scripture the apostle teacheth that the sufferings of this life deserve not the life of glory
neither is it materiall whether we read worthy of it or worthy to it that is equall in worth to it or worthy to be compared to it
for if they be not worthy to it they are not worthy of it neither can they merit or deserve it
the words in the originall are undefined span alphabet not worthy to the glory or not worthy to be compared to it
thus prov

where the greeke readeth undefined span alphabet no precious thing is worthy of wisdome the latine hath non valent comparari they may not be compared with it according to the hebrew
so eccl

alias
undefined span alphabet lat· omnis autem ponderatio non est digna continentis animae
no weight is worthy of her chast mind that is nothing of worth is equall ot to bee compared in worth to it
the meaning then of the words is this
resolve saith the apostle the greeke is undefined span alphabet which signifieth that when a man hath cast his accounts and well weighed the matter he concludeh resolveth determineth as rom



undefined span alphabet of this present time that is the sufferings which the godly sustaine undefined span alphabet are not worthy of so the word undefined span alphabet throughout the new testament doth fignifie or not worthy to bee compared or comparable or equall in worth to the glory which shall bee revealed in us or upon us


xix
in the former sense these words are a direct and absolute

deniall of the merit of condignity
for if the passions of this life are not worthy of eternall life then much lesse the actions of this life
for by the sufferings of this time martyrdome is chiefely meant
now the papists teach that the merit of a martyr is greater than of a confessor that by it as infants by baptisme those which suffer though not before baptized are purged from their sinne and are immediately translated into heaven
and yet of them saint augustine saith

nullo modo superbiant sancti martyres tanquam dignum aliquod pr illius patriae prticipatione fecerint ubi aeterna est vera faelicitas
let not the holy martyrs by any meanes bee lifted up with pride as though they have done something for the participatio of that countrey where is eternall and true felicity

bellarmine

who telleth us that wheresoever in the new testament there is mention of worthinesse there merit is meant is faine to lee from the signification of unworthinesse to the second sense importing disproportion and inequality signifying though hee doth not very well exprsse himselfe when hee saith that the apostle speaketh of the

substance of the workes not of the absolute proportion that howsoever they bee unequall yet they are not unworthy of eternall life
so that this inequality he understandeth not in respect of worth but in respect of length and greatnesse
whereto reply first if undefined span alphabet every where in the new testament signifieth worthy and worthinesse implyeth merit as bellarmine teacheth then undefined span alphabet fignifieth non condigna as their own authentique translation readeth that is they are not worthy which is all one as as if it were said they deserve not nor merit the future glory
oecmenius

upon the place saith undefined span alphabet the apostle sheweth that we are not able either to suffer or to conferre any thing worthy the remnueration that is there

ambrose

the apostle that hee might exhort us unto suffering addeth this reason because all things which we suffer are lesse and unworthy for the paines whereof there should be rendred so great a reward of future good things

eusebius emissenus

ergo totis licet animae corporis laboribus desudemus totis licet obedientiae viribus exerceamur nihil amen condignum merito pro coelestibus compensare afferre valebimus
non valent viae pr sentis obsequia terna vitae gaudiis comparari
lassescant licet membra vigiliis pallescant licet ora jejniis non erunt tamen condignae passiones hujus temporis ad futura gloriam

athanasius in vita sancti antonii cited by bellarmine

ne orbi renunciantes dignum aliquod habitaculis possumus compensare clestibus

augustine

quanto labore dign est requies quae non habet finem si verum vis comparare verum judicare aterna requies terno labore rect emitur
see the testimony of gregory

cited

of this chapter
secondly if they bee unequall if there be a great or rather infinite disproportion betweene our short and light asflictions and the eternall superexcellent weight of glory then cannot our sufferings merit eternall life
for betweene the merit and the reward there must bee some proportion of equality
wherefore this text as in the former sense it directly contradicteth the merit of condignity so in the latter it doth disprove it by necessary consequence
for condigne merits are equall to the ward the sufferings of this life are not equall to the future glory therefore they doe not merit eternall life


xx neither will it helpe our rhemists nor ellarmine himselfe to salve their errour with blasphemy
the note of the rhemists upon the word condigne is this
our adversaries grond hereon that the workes or sufferings of this life be not meritorious or worthy of life ever lasting where the apostle saith no such thing no more than he saith that christs passions be not meritorious of his expresseth onely that the very afflictions of their owne nature which suffer with or for him but shrt momentay and of no account in comparison of the recompece which we shall have in eaven
no more indeed were christs paies of their nature compared to his glory any whit comparable yet they wre eritorious worthy of heaven and so be ours
where they seeme to put no difference between the head and

his members
if christ did merit his glory by his short fufferings then doe we if wee doe not then not he
but their wisedomes should have considered the obedience of christ was the obedience of god that is of him who was and is god that the sufferings which hee did sustaine were the sufferings of god the bloud which he shed for us was the bloud of god act


and therefore of infinite and all sufficient value and merit both to satisfie for our sinnes and to merit for us eternall life
whereas our obedience and our sufferings are the sufferings and obedience of sinnefull men
and therefore if they will not still bee antichristians they must acknowledge that to satisfe sor the punishment of hel and to merit heaven are priviledges and prerogatives peculiar to christ our head whose sufferings and obedience by reason of the dignity of his person are of infinit valew and worth not to satisfie or merit for himselfe sor that needed not seeing the man christ by reason of the hypostaticall union was in the dayes of his flesh as the papists themselves teach both viator and comprehensor enjoying from the first instant of his conception the beatificall vision but for the world and for more worlds if there were more
but here bellarmine doth instance first that as the passion of christ was much shorter than the paines of hell yet because of the dignity of the person which suffered was most worthy to be esteemed a ful satisfaction so though the passions of this time be short and that glory be eternall notwithstanding betweene these sufferings and that glory there is a proportion by reason of the dignity of charity whence they proceed
and this seemeth to have beene the meaning of bellarmines distinction that the apostle denyeth the sufferings of this life to be equall to the future glory in respect of the substance of the worke and considered in hemselves as they are humane as they are short and light they are no way equall to the future glory yet as they are as it were divine proceeding from the divine grace of charity they have an equall and as hee calleth it an absolute proportion
thus they make an idoll of charity as if it being not onely finite but also unperfect and but begunne were of sufficient worth and dignity to merit an infinite reward
and yet the apostle speaking of the sufferings of the faithfull who as it was said in the verses going before are the sonnes and heires of god endued with the spirit yea of martyrs who are endued with a great measure of charity denyeth them to be condigne to the glory which shall be revealed

his second instance is by comparison taken from the delights of sin which are incomparably lesse than the torments of hell yet because of the contempt of god they are worthy to bee punished with those torments
reply
whatsoever the delights of sinne be the guilt of sinne is infinite and cannot be taken away but by an infinite satisfaction
the third instance is of an unlike smilitude of seed compared to the tree as though the tree were merited by the seed betweene which though very unequall there is a proportion
reply
betweene all things that are finite there may be a proportion though not an equall proportion which must be between the merit and the reward betweene that which is finite and that which is infinite there is no proportion at all


xxi
but letting passe all other proofes bellarmine will needes

make the apostle contradict himselfe as if elsewhere he did teach that the sufferings of this present time are worthy or meritorious of eternall glory
because he saith cor

for that our tribulation which presently is momentany and light worketh above measure exceedingly an eternall weight of glory in us
worketh saith he non physicè sed moraliter id est non efficienter sed meritoriè not naturally but morally that is not efficiently but meritoriously et per hoc dignas esse passiones hujus temporis quibus gloria illajusto judicio tribuatur and consequently that the sufferings of this time are worthy that in just judgement that glory should be given unto them which is the direct contradiction of this place
but this allegation fully answered

before it being his fifth testimony whereby he would prove good workes to be necessary to salvation by the necessity of efficiencie
here it shall be sufficient to shew that merit cannot hence be proved
yea but saith hee afflictions are said to worke this weight of glory which must not bee understood physically that is efficiently but morally that is meritoriously whereto reply that a meritorious cause is an efficient cause and that which worketh meritoriously worketh efficiently though not contrariwise
and therfore although from hence sufficiency were proved yet merit is not
for pray what is here said to worke tribulation but though tribulation worke as it and all things else doe worke together for the good of gods children rom

yet doth tribulation merit then is it a meritorious thing to be afflicted and punished
for affliction is malum poenae the evill of punishment merited by sinne
doth affliction then worke salvation surely no more then the afflicter who is the instrument of our affliction and seeketh our destruction
doth not the afflicter merit no more doth the affliction there may be some efficiency both in the afflicter and in the affliction but meanes there can be none in either
the efficiency may be shewed thus
affliction undefined span alphabet

worketh patience not meritoriously but by another kind of efficiencie and that not of it selfe and in it owne nature which being evill moveth rather

to impatience but by accident and occasionally the holy ghost using it as a meanes to exercise our faith and to worke patience in us and therefore in this and such like places

the word undefined span alphabet signifieh no more than occasioneth
patience worketh undefined span alphabet probation viz declarativè for bearing afflictions patiently a man is knowne to be undefined span alphabet iam

that is a sound and approved christian undefined span alphabet or probation worketh efficiently or produceth hope and in spe in hope though not in re we are saved
this working therefore is not by way of merit

but what manner of thing is that which is here said to worke and what manner of thing is that which is here said to bee wrought that which worketh is undefined span alphabet]· the momentany lightnesse of our affliction the thing wrought is undefined span alphabet which is more emphaticall and hyperbolicall to signifie the infinitenes of that glory than am able to expresse
there being then no proportion betwixt the momentany lightnes of affliction and the more than hyperbolicall

exceedingly exceeding weight of glory eternall how can thre be merit to that which hath beene said concerning this place rom

three other considerations may be added the two former out of hierome

id est that a man could not suffer any thing worthy the eternall glory though it were such as this present life is
the other is that all he can suffer is not more but a great deale lesse than by his sinne he hath deserved
and how then can he by the sufferings of this life wherby he is not able to atisfie for his sinne deserve eternall life the third out of bernard

we doe know saith he that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to the future glory nec si unas omnis sustineat no that they are not though one man should sustayne them all which though it be a very great yet is a very true amplification that if one man should beare all the afflictions of all men in this world yet his afflictions of this time would not be worthy of the glory that shall be revealed
such amplifications are used no lesse truely by chrysostome and anselm
chrysostome

saith undefined span alphabet
if we should dye ten thousand deaths and if wee should shew forth al virtue yet could wee not recompence the least part of those honours that god hath already bestowed upon us
and if wee cannot by all such meanes be answearable to god for his favours ouchsafed in this world by what meanes might we hope to merit eternall life in the world to come if a man should serve god most devoutly

a thousand yeares yet he should not condignely merit to bee in the kingdome of heaven halfe a day saith anselme


xxii
in the sixth place bellarmine alleageth three testimonies

as objected by us viz phil


ephes


tit

the first we doe not use to produce against merit of salvation but against justification by inherent righteousnesse and was the sixth testimony of ours which bellarmine endevoured to answere as hee doth here
see lib
cap



the second was the fourth testimony which he tooke upon him to answer
see my reply lib
cap



the third was the fifth testimonie of which see lib
cap



but though we doe not alleage the first against merit of workes yet by

by consequent it doth disprove it
for if workes doe not concurre to justification as the matter therof then can they not be the merit of salvation as hath beene said
secondly if in the question of justification which concerneth our title to salvation they are to be accounted as things of no worth yea as losse then are they not meritorious of eternall life
and whereas bellarmine challengeth us to alleage any one father that understandeth paul to speake of workes done after grace alleaged before saint chrysostome upon the place who understandeth the apostle as speaking of all undefined span alphabet he said all both old and new both past and present and that confirmed by reason
and when he saith that augustine calleth the righteousnesse of the faithfull eminentissimam it is apparant that he speaketh not of that which wee have by our obedience performed to the law but of that most eminent righteousnesse which wee have by

faith
the other two places exclude workes from being any causes as well of salvation as of justification
and it is plaine that the apostle speaketh of salvation and of all the degrees thereof that it is wholly to bee ascribed to the grace of god and not our worthinesse

his words in the former by grace you are saved through faith no of workes
the latter not by workes of righteousnesse which we have done but according to his mercie he saved us
whence ariseth this argument
if by our merits we are saved then by workes but not by our workes therefore not by merits
or thus if not by workes we are saved because we are saved by grace then much lesse are we saved by our owne merits

cap iii
a new supply of reasons produced against merits and maintayned against bellarmines cavills


ovr first reason
the true doctrine of justification

and salvation taketh from us all cause of boasting in our selves that he

which glorieth may glory in the lord and contrariwise that which doth not take away all cause of boasting in our selves is not the true doctrine

the doctrine of justification by faith without workes and of salvation by gods free grace without our merit taketh from us all cause of our boasting in our selves but the doctrine of justification by workes and of salvation by our owne merits doth not take away all cause of boasting in our selves
both proved rom



ephes


the effect of bellarmines answere is that they who plead their owne merits as proceeding from grace do not glory themselves but in the lord

reply first so long as they bee ours though given of god as all other good things are we are apt to glory in them as appeareth by the pharisee who boasteth

of his merits though he acknowledgeth that hee received them from god and therefore rendreth thankes for them
secondly the pleading of merit is it selfe a proud boasting matth


thirdly the papists plead merit as proceeding from their owne free will which they require as a necessary condition of merit
fourthly if the good worke proceed meerely from gods grace then can we not by it merit any thing of god
but

the papists teach that by it they merit of god and consequently deny it so farre forth as it meriteth to proceed fom the grace of god and therefore when they plead merit they glory in themselves rather than in the lord


ii
our second reason that doctrine which derogateth from the infinite and merit of christ is to bee renounced as false and antichristian

the popish doctrine of merits viz that we are to be saved by our owne merits and that the faithfull by their owne workes doe truely and condignely merit eternall life derogateth from the infinite and merit of christ
therefore it is false and antichristian
the assumption they deny yea though indeed they doe derogate from the merit of christ yet they denounce

anathema against them that shall say so
but we not only say it but prove it
for first if christ hath already most sufficiently and fully merited heaven for us then our merits are needlesse or if our merits bee needfull as they teach then are not christs sufficient for us which is no better than blasphemie

secondly they who teach that christ hath not merited for all that beleeve and as soone as they truely beleeve the right of eternall life doe greatly derogate from the merit of christ
for the scriptures doe teach that christ hath so merited the right of eternall life to all the faithfull that by him they have

alreadie eternall life being alreadie translated from death to life

but they who teach that the faithfull are to merit the right of eternall life by their owne good workes doe in effect teach that christ hath not merited it to the faithfull
therefore they who teach that the faithfull are to merit the right of eternall life by their owne good workes doe greatly derogate from the merit of christ

this assumption may thus bee demonstrated that which a man hath already he needeth not to merit
for to merit is to obtaine by desert that right which a man hath not yet
nullus meretr saith

thomas quod am habet and againe

meritum non est nisi ejus quod nondm habetur
therefore the faithfull if they have already right to gods kingdome they need not merit it or if they must merit then have they not as yet that right by christ but must purchase it by their owne deserts which is greatly to derogate from the merits of christ
but the faithfull before they produce any good works have right to gods kingdome
nm hoc ips saith bellarmine

quòd incipi esse fili dei jus habere ad hareditatem falicitatis ternae rom

gl

utem esse filii dei ntequam incipimus benè jus habemu ad aternam bareditatem per gratiam benè operari
for in that very respect that wee bginne to bee the sonnes of god wee beginne to have right to the inheritance of the eternàll feliciy rom
gl
now wee beginne to bee the sonnes of god before wee beginne to bring forth good

workes
merit igitur christus saith hee christ therefore merited the inheritance it selfe whiles he merited the grace of adoption and againe

unto him who is the sonne of god by grace the inheritance is due by the right of adoption before all workes
in which place bellarmine teacheth another point of doctrine whereby is excluded the merit of good workes

ex eo quod aliquis saith hee est filius dei per gratiam meretur ex condigno haereditatem vitae aeternae sine alio pacto sed merito personae non merito operis
by this that any man is the sonne of god by grace hee doth merit condignely the inheritance of everlasting life without any other covenant for if sonnes then heires but hee doth merit it by the merit of his person not by the merit of his worke what needeth then the childe of god bring forth good workes with purpose to merit heaven by them seeing before hee produceth any good workes hee hath right unto the kingdome of heaven by the merit of his person in that hee is the sonne of god why forsoooth as it is an inheritance hee meriteth it by the merit of his person but as it is a mercenary reward or stipend or wages hee must earne it by the merit of his workes which is absurd for if it bee a free gift intended in our election without any relation to our desert a free inheritance purchased for us by christ and freely promised to all that beleeve and free reward of our obedience which is therefore by augustine and others called gratia because it is freely given it cannot without absurdity be made the mercenary reward or wages of hired servants

thirdly to attribute that honour to every member of the body which is peculiar to christ alone the head is to derogate from the honour of christ our head
but to merit eternall life is an honour peculiar to christ alone our head
for eternall life in heaven being of infinite worth as being the eternall fruition of god who is infinite cannot be condignely merited but by that which is of infinite value and price
such are the merits of christ and of him alone such neither ours nor any meere creatures are or can be
for the infinite merit of eternall life dependeth on the infinitenesse of the person who meriteth it such an one is christ such are none of his members
therefore to christ alone it belongeth to merit heaven for his members and not to his members who are not to merit but by faith to apprehend the merit of their head
fourthly that which taketh from christ the glory of being the onely meritorious cause of salvation doth grealy detract from the of christs merits
the popish doctrine concerning the merit of workes taketh from christ the glory of being the onely meritorious cause of our salvation therefore it doth greatly derogate from the merit of christ

fifthly they who ascribe the condigne merit of heaven to their owne good workes and to salve the matter doe faine that christ hath merited for their good workes that they may condignely merit heaven doe indeed robbe christ of the honour of meriting for us eternall life and doe arrogate it unto themselves
thus doe the papists who ascribe the condigne merit of heaven to their owne works and to bleare the eyes of the simple they faine that christ merited for our workes that they might be meritorious of eternall life for neither by the scriptures nor fathers nor any sound reason doe they so much as goe about to prove this fiction this novelty
christ did not save us to make us our owne saviours but in his owne person and as the apostle speaketh undefined span alphabet

by himselfe he performed the worke of our redemption and the merit of our salvation

object

but you will say did christ merit for us that we should be idle answere wee are the workemanship of god created unto good workes which god hath preordained that we should walke in them not to merit by them but to glorifie god by them to testifie our thankefulnesse and to make our calling and elction sure and for many other reasons which delivered when proved the necessity of good workes
object

it is not fit that christs merits should bee applyed to men without workes
answ
the merits of christ are applyed to us that is wee are justified by them without workes as the apostle teacheth howbeit in them that are justified good workes doe follow but not as causes of justification or as merits of salvation
object

but it is necessary we should be like unto christ

answ
wee must bee like to him in the graces of sanctification which we receive from his fulnesse even grace for grace rom

ion

pet


but wee cannot bee like unto him in office of mediation or in the power of meriting which is proper to the head


iii
this argument that the doctrine of merits is derogatory to the merits of our onely saviour is worthy to bee insisted upon and defended against all exceptions and cavils of the papists which indeed are many but may be reduced to these three heads for either they serve to shew that their doctrine doth not derogate from christs merits or that their doctrine setteth forth the glory of christs merit no lesse than ours or that wee by denying their doctrine doe extenuate such is their impudency the merit of christ

to the first purpose

bellarmine hath foure evasions
the first that the merits of just men are not opposite to the merits of christ but spring from them
and what commendation soever our merits have that wholly redoundeth to the praise of christs merit
for hee is the vine wee are the branches
and as a branch canot bring forth fruit unlesse it abide in the vine even so we without christ can doe nothing
and as never any man was so unwise as

to say that the fruitefulnesse of the branches detracteth from the glory of the vine so no man that is not a very foole would say that it is a derogation from the glory of christ if his servants by his grace by his spirit by faith and charity inspired from him bring forth good workes which are so truely just that unto them is due from the just iudge a crowne of iustice

repl
to which answere assent in some particulars
first that it is indeed a great honour to christ if his members doe bring forth much fruit iohn

as contrarywise it is a great dishonour to him when any of his members defile themselves with any crime cor

secondly that having union with christ as his members wee have also communion with him both in his merits to our justification and salvation and also in the vertue of his death to mortifie sinne in us and of his resurrection to raise us unto newnesse of life
by influence of which virtue from christ our head the holy spirit enableth us to bring forth the fruites of good workes
but that these good works though wrought by the spirit though proceeding from faith and charity though acceptable to god in christ though graciously rewarded by him are so perfect and of such value that they should bee either satisfactory to gods justice or meritorious of eternall life that we utterly deny these being prerogatives peculiar to our head who onely hath both satisfied the justice of god and also merited heaven for us and that to this end that neither satisfaction should be required of us for our sinnes for which wee cannot satisfie but by eternall punishment nor merit of eternall life expected from us which cannot bee merited but by a price of infinite value
for if there be need of either then either christ hath not fully satisfied or not sufficiently merited for us
and as it is a certaine trueth that christ did not to this end satisfie for us that wee should satisfie which to us is impossible but that we should be freed from the necessity of satisfying gods justice as being already satisfied so it is no lesse true that christ did not to that end merit heaven for us that we should merit it which to us is impossible but that wee should bee freed from the necessity of meriting it which christ hath merited and should rely wholly and onely on the satisfaction and merit of christ
if they say that christ hath merited for us those graces and works by which wee are to merit heaven demand whether christ himselfe did merit heaven for us or not if so then need not our merits
if not then doe they not onely part stakes with christ but assume the greater merit which is of glory to themselves and leave the lesse which is of grace to christ and that not entire neither
for the obtaininig of righteousnesse as they doe not wholly ascribe to their owne free will so neither to gods grace but partly to god offering grace and partly to their owne free will which willingly accepteth of grace when it might refuse it
and this willingnesse whatsoever they pretend to the contrary is in mine opinion the very root from whence their conceipted merit doth spring


iv
his second evasion that merit of men are required not becase

of the insufficiency but because of the great efficacy of christs merits which merited with god not onely that wee shld obtaine salvation but that wee should obtaine it by our owne proper merits or which is all one that they merited not onely eternall salvation for us but also the virtue or power of meriting

repl
this answere is nothing but a meee begging of the question taking for granted that which wee uttey deny and none of them shall ever bee able to prove that christ merited for us that wee our selves should merit eternall life
for first the power of meriting heaven at the hands of god is christs peculiar neither can ny meere man no not in the state of innocency nor any angell not any meere creature merit any reward at the hands of god because when they have done all they have done but their duety
much lesse can wee who never doe all and that which wee doe is stained with the flesh and is mingled with manifold transgressions if not of commission from which none are free yet at least of omission

secondly that christ died for our sinnes to free us from hell and that hee in his owne person performed all obedience both

passive and active that thereby we might be justified and saved wee read in the scriptures
but that he dyed for our good workes to make them meritorious or that he merited for us the power of meriting heaven which power is proper to himselfe alone and presupposeth infinitenesse of merit and worth we reade not
the similitude which bellarmine useth of the sunne whereby god doth illuminate the world and of other secondary causes which god doth use as meanes whereby to worke which argue not gods inability but his omnipotencie in giving such power to his creatures to prove that god his saving us by our owne merits doth not argue the insufficiency of christs merit but the sufficiency in giving such power to our merits is as meere a begging of the question as the former taking for granted that as god doth enlighten the world by the sunne which all men know by experience so hee doth save us by our owne merits when as the scriptures in plaine termes deny us to bee saved by our workes but wholly and onely by the merits of christ
besides the similitude is altogether unlike
for god doth not illuminate the inferiour world by himselfe but by the sunne nor performe those other actions by himselfe immediately for which he hath ordained secondary causes as his instruments working ordinarily by meanes
but christ by himselfe

hath merited for us giving the virtue and power of meriting to nothing out of himselfe



his third evason that they doe not part the glory betweene christ and themselves becase they acknowledge their merits to be the gifts of god and that there is no good thing in themselves which is theirs and not

gods from whose grace the force of merit dependeth
which answere altogether taketh from our workes the power of meriting with god

for how can we merit of god by that which is his but indeed this evasion which here is used to serve the present turne is not suitable with the popish doctrine which teacheth men to part stakes with god as have said
first in respect of grace the efficacy whereof they divide betweene god and their owne free will
secondly in respect of their justification for the first they ascribe after a sort to grace the second which is increase of justice to their owne merit
thirdly in respect of goo workes which as they bee wholly gods so be they wholly their owne as bellarmine here saith


vi
his fourth evasion that though wee be saved by our owne merits yet wee are no lesse beholden unto christ than if wee were saved without them but rather more
because wee are not onely saved by his grace but are also by it saved after a most noble and onourable maner that is to say by our owne merits which he hath merited for us that we by them might merit eternall life
as if hee should say christ hath saved us that is hath merited grace and good workes for us that wee by them may become our owne saviours
this soundeth well for mans praise who would faine have a share in his owne salvation
but it becommeth to say

not unto us lord not unto us but to thy name give the praise
for what glory we arrogate to our selves we derogate from god who will not give his glory to another
if god is to have all the glory then are wee to have none
if wee take any part to our

selves we doe not ascribe it wholly to god
it is very true that we are beholden and bound to christ not onely for salvation it selfe but also for those graces and good workes unto which eternall life is rendred as a free reward
but the more gifts and graces wee receive from christ the more we owe unto him the lesse we can merit of him
if we call his graces our merits and his gift and free reward our deserved hire as the papists doe then doe we challenge unto our selves the praise both of the one and of the other
but if christ in his owne person and by himselfe hath merited for us both eternall life it selfe and those things also unto which it is promised as a free reward with what face can wee ascribe it to our owne merits or if we doe ascribe it to our owne merits though but in part how doe we not part stakes with god


vii
and whereas hee saith it is a most honourable way to be

saved by our owne merits aske whether more honourable to god or to us if to us the scripture teacheth us to strippe our selves of all honour in the matter of our salvation and to ascribe all honour and glory to god
it were indeed more honourable for man to need no saviour than being utterly lost in himselfe to be saved by another
it were more honourable for man to be free from all sinne and to bee indued with most perfect righteousnesse and if it were possible to merit his owne salvation than being by sinne fallen into the state of damnation to need a saviour
but now man having by his apostasie from god lost that honourable estate wherein hee was created and fallen into a state of misery his glory wherein hee is now to rejoyce

is that god who gave no redeemer to the angels that fell gave his onely begotten sonne to redeeme him his merit as gods mercy his honour that of a child of satan and of a firebrand of hell hee is by christ made the sonne of god and heire of eternall life
and for gods glory it is not to bee doubted but that it was most honourable to god for the illustration of the glory both of his mercy and also of his justice that man being fallen should bee saved by the merits of christ that being redeemed and justified he should still bee subject both to inward infirmities and corruptions and also to outward temptations that in our weakenesse his strength might appeare that we should not trust to our owne merits or boast in our owne worthinesse but should rely wholly on the mercies of god and merits of christ ascribing the whole glory of our salvation thereunto and not to our owne merits who can deserve othing but punishment at the hands of god if hee should enter into judgement with us
and these were bellarmines evasions


viii
others say that their doctrine of merits nothing derogateth

from the merits of christ there being no great difference as they conceive betwene our doctrine who teach that christ our saviour did himselfe and in his owne person both pay our debt and purchase heaven for us and theirs who hold that christ indeed paid our debt but to purchase heaven hee himselfe did not lay downe the price but did as it were put money into our purses whereby wee might purchase and merit the same for our selves
but as the paiment of our debt requireth a ransome of infinite value so the purchase of heaven is not to be procured at a lesse price
christ therefore gave himselfe to be

undefined span alphabet a full price of redemption for us not only by

himselfe purging our sinnes and paying our debt by satisfying the penalty of the law but also by giving a sfficient price which is his merit to purchase the heavenly inheritance for us
the benefit of this his merit christ applyeth and communicateth to all that truly beleeve in him but the power of meriting is not communicable to the members who are meere creatures but is peculiar to our head who is both perfect man and perfect god also
and therefore no obedience whether active or passive of any but of his person onely is meritorious


ix
the more impudent is the recrimination of our english

iesuits who are not ashamed to affirme that wee who use justly to censure them for derogating from the merits of christ that we say extenuate the merit of christ in denying that hee mrited for our good workes that they should condignely merit eternall life and that therein wee erre fundamentally
the impudency whereof is much the greater because they are not able to alleage any text of scripture or testimony of any of the ancient fathers testifying that christ did merit for us the power of meriting
for it was not the purpose of our saviour to communicate that power to his members which is a peculiar prerogative of the head neither was it his meaning to

save us to that end that we should be our owne saviours
neither is it credible that hee would give us money as it were to enable us in our owne persons either to pay our debt or to purchase our iheritance seeing himselfe in his owne person hath paid the full price of our redemption and by his owne personall merits hath fully and al sufficiently purchased he heavenly inheritance for us
for to what end should he give us wherewith to merit when he himselfe hath more than sufficiently merited for us so that no oher merit needeth
but if other merits are required besides how his is merit acknowledged againe if it had beene christs purpose to give us wherewith to merit then would he have infused most perfect righteousnesse into us which should not have beene stained with any sinfulnesse neither should need remission or indulgence but we are so farre from having this power to merit heaven that the best of us had need to pray with david

as being not more just than he enter not into judgement with thy servants lord for if thou shouldest marke what is amisse who should stand and with the apostles as being not more holy than they forgive us our trespasses our chiefe righteousnesse in this life consisting as augustine

truely saith in remission of sinnes rather than in perfection of virtues
now whiles we are sinners in our selves as all are wee cannot merit any thing but punishment at the hands of god and whiles wee deserve hell how can we possibly merit heaven


these were the arguments which bellarmine tooke upon him

to answere but could not satisfie
now wee are to adde some others
our third reason therefore is this if we cannot merit so much as temporall blessings at the hands of god then much lesse eternall but wee cannot merit so much as temporall blessings at gods hands and therfore much lesse eternall


the assumption prove thus first by the confession of iacob gen

that he was lesse than the least of gods mercies
of david concerning mankinde in generall psal

and concerning himselfe in particular sam


secondly if by all our labours and endevours wee are not able to merit of god so mch as a piece of bread but must beg it at gods hands then can wee not merit eternall life of him
but the former is true for therefore our saviour hath taught us to make this daily praier that god would give us day by day our daily bread
to this purpose saint hierome

saith well that a man could not suffer any thing worthy the heavenly glory though it were such as this present life is
but chrysstome

goeth further if we should dye ten thousand times as he was before
anastasius

for what good things soever we doe we are not answerable to god undefined span alphabet for the aire alone which we breathe

basill those which are esteemed retributions are granted to men onely for the lords bounty sake for all the righteousnesse of mortall men doe not match the gifts already vouchfafed much lesse those which are to come which exceed our thought
but most agreeable to our doctrine is that assertion of gregrius

ariminensis quòd dum aeerna vita that no act of man though proceeding from never

so great charity doth condignely merit with god not onely eternall life but not so much as any other reward whether eternall or temporall


xi
our fourth reason that which we attaine unto by right of

adoption as our inheritance purchased by christ and prepared for us from the beginning of the world without any respect to our merits that we doe not obtaine by our merits

vnto eternall life we doe attaine by right of adoption as our inheritance purchased by christ and prepared for us from the beginning of the world and that without any respect of our merits
therefore we doe not attaine to eternall life by our merits

the assumption is manifest for therefore in many places of scripture the kingdome of heaven is called our inheritance act




gal


ephes





col

and that an eternall and incorruptible inheritance heb

pet


and of this kingdome the faithfull are heires iam

for therefore are we adopted the sons of god that we may be heires heires of god and fellow heires of christ rom

gal


and to the same end are we justified by his grace that we might according to hope bee made heires of eternall life tit

bellarmine himselfe hath taught as we have

heard that we are entituled to the kingdome of heaven jure adoptionis
and in that

we begin to be the sons of god wee begin have right to the inheritance of the eternall elicity now we begin to be the sonnes of god before wee begin to bring forth good workes
and hereby appeareth the truth of the proposition for we have our right of adoption not by merit but by the free grace of god who hath predestinated

us unto the adoption of children by iesus christ to himselfe according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
and this inheritance was prepared for us from the beginning of the world mat

if it be objected that as it is called an inheritance so also a reward and reward presupposeth merit for so the councill of trent

teacheth that eternall life is to be propounded to the godly both as grace that is a free gift promised by christ and as a reward duely to be rendred to their merits according to gods promise
answere that eternall life is no such reward as presupposeth merit for it is a free reward freely promised freely given
neither can those things stand together which the councill of trent hath conjoyned that eternall life should both bee gratia a free gift graciously promised and freely bestowed and also a due wages to be rendred to desert neither if it be the reward of inheritance as it is called col

which is freely bestowed on the sonnes of god it cannot be a mercenary wages which is due to hired servants


xii
our fifth reason if good workes do merit eternall life

then are they causes of it for merits be the causes of that which is merited

but good workes are not the cause of eternall life therefore they doe

not merit it
the assumption prove first from that received testimony of

bernard that good workes are via regni non causa regnandi
quid autem hac conclusione firmius saith

cassander who also saith that thomas bradwardin and divers other schoolemen deny good workes to bee the cause of the eternall reward and that some who call them causes doe meane causam sine qua non which properly is no cause

secondly true causes of salvation may bee trusted in for the obtaining of salvation

our good workes are not to be trusted in for the obtaining of salvation
therefore they are not true causes thereof

the proposition is bellarmines

licet confidere in omni vera causa

the assumption also in effect is his
for if it be most safe as he truly saith

by reason of the uncertainty of our owne righteousnesse which none of them can be certaine of without speciall revelation and danger of vaine glory not to trust in our owne merits but to repose ur whole affiance in the only mercy and bountyof god then are they fooles who repose affiance in their owne workes
and no doubt but they are fooles who trust in their owne heart as salomon saith prov

for as adrian saith

who after was pope our merits are like astaffe of reed which not onely breaketh when it is leaned upon but also pierceth the hand of him that leaneth on it
to trust in a mans owne righteousness is the property of a proud iustitiary and hypocrite ezec

luke

and of one that is accursed

because hee removeth his heart rom god and putteth his trust in man that is to say hmselfe for as

bernard well faith for a man to trust in himselfe non fidei· sed per dem est nec confidentiae sed diffidentiae magis in semetipso habere fiduciam
but the true and upright christian renouncing all confidence in his owne righteousnesse as being a beggar in spirit matth


resteth wholly on the mercies of god and merits of christ psal



dan


cor

phil


according to the advice of our saviour luk


if it be objected that the godly in many places of scripture doe alleage their owne innocency and integrity as seeming to put some affiance therein· king


nehem


psal

tim


answere first it is one thing to place affiance in our good works as causes of our salvation as

use to doe another from our good workes as tokens and signes of our election vocation justification and as presages of our glorification to gather comfort assrance and hope to our selves of our justification and salvation which the faithfull use to doe and to that end are they commanded to practise good workes that they make their calling and election sure pt

this distinction is acknowledged by

bellarmine sciendum est saith hee aliud esse fidciam nasci ex alid fiduciam esse ponendam in meritis
it is one thing out of our good workes to gather assurance and affiance in god which the faithfull doe as they

are exhorted in the scriptures pet


iob

rom

probation worketh hope ioh

if our heart condemne us not then have wee confidence towards god and it is another thing to place affiance in our merits which none but proud iustitiaries and pharisaicall hypocrites use to doe
secondly we must distinguish betwixt the innocency and justice of a mans cause and the innocency and justice of his person
for the same men in the scripture who for the justification of their persons desire the lord

not to enter into judgement with them for the justification of their cause have not feared

to appeale to gods judgement


xiii
our sixth reason those who cannot fully discharge their duety much lesse can they merit
for they that merit must doe more than their duety
for they that doe but their duety though they doe all that is commanded must acknowledge

themselves to be unprofitable servants
but if they faile in their duety and come short of that which is commanded then can they merit nothing but punishment at the hands of god
but no mortall man is able fully to satisfie his duety
our duety is to abstaine from all sinne yea to be from all sinne and to doe the things commanded to doe all and to continue in doing all and that in that manner and measure which the law requireth
but those things no mortall man is able to doe as hath beene proved heretofore
so farre is every mortall man from meriting any thing but punishment at the hands of god

our seventh reason
if good workes doe merit salvation then wee are saved by them but we are not saved by good workes ephes


tit

therefore they doe not merit salvation
eightly the last reason
the heavenly canaan is a land of promise as the earthly canaan was which the lord gave to the israelites not because of their merits deut

nor for the merit of their forefathers iosh

but because he loved them and that for no other cause but because hee loved them deut

in which love as hee freely promised it so in the same undeerved love he did freely bestow it
and yet hee was just in giving it because hee had promised it nehem


the same wee are to conceive of the heavenly canaan whereof the other was a type that it is a land of promise and no of merit freely promised and freely bestowed on the heires of promise

cap iiii
testimonies of fathers disproving merits and first those which bellarmine hath sought to answere and then others



to the former testimonies and proofes will adjoyne the testimonies of fathers and other writers
and first those which bellarmine

hath endeavoured to answere of which hilarie

is the first
spes in misericordia dei in sculum in seculum seculi est
non enim illa ipsa justitiae opera sufficient ad perfect beatitudinis meritum nisi misericordia dei etiam in hac justiae voluntate hmanarum demutationum motuum vitia non reputet hinc illud prophetae dictum est melior est misericordia tua super tantum misericordia dei muneratur ut miserans justitia voluntatem aeternitatis quoque suae justum quemque tribuat esse participem
his intendement is that the hope of salvation is to bee placed in gods mercy which is better than our righteous life
for the workes of righteousnesse without gods mercy in forgiving of sinnes will not suffice to obtaine the reward of blessednesse which the mercy of god pitying our will of righteousnesse bestoweth on the just
but bellmine maketh him speake what pleaseth him for to omit that for sufficient hee readeth sufficerent hilary saith hee doth teach that with our goodworkes are mingled certaine sinnes which though they make not a man unjust as being light nd venill yet they need pardon and mercy because nothing that is defiled can enter into the kingdome of heaven
bellarines meaning is that at the day of judgement the faithfull shall need gods mercy for the pardoning of veniall sinnes as heretofore

ee hath taught
but there is no such matter in hilary neither is it tue as have shewed

befor that at the day of udgement the faithfull shall need remission of veniall or any other sinnes neither doth hilary say that the sinnes which are forgiven by the mercy of god are light and such as the papists call veniall
neither is it true that there bee any sinnes which doe not make them sinners in whom they are seeing bellarmine here confesseth that men are so defiled by them that they being not remitted exclude them from heaven neither doth hee say with good merits are mingled sines neither doth he call those workes which are mingled with sinnes good merits for that implyeth a contradiction but hee saith they doe not suffice to merit or obtaine the reward of blessednesse and therefore indeed denyeth the workes of righteousnesse to merit eternall life


ii
the second is basil mane sempitern requies illos qui in hac

vitalegitimè certaverunt non ob eorum merita factorum sed de munificentissimi dei gratia in quem sperârunt which is a pregnant testimony
but bellarm· taking advantage at the printers fault in the old edition of basil leaving out the word undefined span alphabet which since hath bin supplyed answereththat chemnitius did not rightly translate the words of basil for in the greeke neither the words non ob eorum merita are found nor the word grati
the words are these undefined span alphabet
there is propounded an evelasting est to them who lawfully strive in this life not rendred according to the debt or due of works but according to the grace of the most bountifull god in whom they have trusted where the word undefined span alphabet]· if it were not expressed is of necessity to be understood and the rather because he seemeth by allusion to invert the words of the apostle rom
undefined span alphabet
for with bellarmine in stead of undefined span alphabet to repeate undefined span alphabet as if he had said according to the duety or debt of the most bountifull god or great giver it is absurd gift and debt being contrary
and also by undefined span alphabet debt or duty to understand as hee doth measure which becommeth the bounty of god that is much greater than is due to the workes is no lesse absurd
for neither doth undefined span alphabet siignifie measure neither is the word undefined span alphabet repeated in the latter clause which signifieth rendred but undefined span alphabet that is exhibited which bellarmine leaveth out
neither doth hee say undefined span alphabet as bellarmine absurdly understandeth him to speake for there is no debt or duety of god
neither would it hinder our cause if the word rendred were repeated in the latter clause for what is promised is to bee rendred
but in plaine termes basil saith that eternall rest to them that live well is not rendred undefined span alphabet according to the merit of their workes but undefined span alphabet according to the grace of the munifint god exhibited

but his second evasion is more grosse that basil speaketh of the reward as rendred not according to the merit of workes which men have done by their owne strength but such as are done by grace
repl· basil plainely speaketh of those who fought a good fight in this life and have trusted in god and saith that the eternall rest is laid up for them and that it is rendied not according to the merit of works but given according to the gace of god the great giver
neither doth he speake of naturall or gacelesse men of whom he never dreamed that the eternall rest is pepared for them but of godly men such as david was whose wods returne unto thy rest my soule were the occasion of this speech
besides if the rewrd bee rendred as bellarmine saith supra condignum· how is it merited condign or if it be merted ex condigno how is it supra condignum


iii
the third is saint augustines out of whom reciteth

onely three places as ited by us the firl

sunt dei sunt
the sinnes are thine the merits are gods
supplicium tibi debetur cum praemium vnerit ua dona corabit non meria
punishment

is due to thee
and when the reward shall come hee will crowne his owne gifts not thy merits


pro

nihilo salvos facies illos nihil invenies unde salves multum invenis vnde damnes thou wilt save them for nothing thou findest nothing for which to save and thou findest much for which to condemne


maluit dicere gratia dei vita terna ut intelligeremus non pro meritis

nostr is deum nos ad aeternam vitam sed pro sua miseratione perducere he chose rather to say that life eternall is the grace of god that wee might understand that not for our merits but for his owne mercie hee doth bring us unto eternall life
which are most plaine and pregnant testimonies
bellarmine answereth in grosse wheresoever augustine condemneth merits he speaketh of such merits as be in us from our selves that is to say without the grace of god
and to this purpose he quoteth august
epist

ad sixtum in two places and his book de gratia lib arbitr



reply augustine by merits understandeth good workes which hee considereth either as going before grace wrought by the strength of our owne free will which against the pelagians he denyeth merit either grace or glory or he speaketh of them as proceeding from grace which he acknowledgeth to be rewarded with eternall life
but these though he call them merits because they are to be rewarded yet every where he saith that the reward is given to them not as to our merits deserving it but as to the free gifts of god
and therfore that the reward it selfe is called gratia both because it is freely given and because those workes to which it is given are wholly to bee ascribed to gods grace and consequently that the lord when he rewardeth our workes with eternall life doth not reward them as our merits but as his owne gifts than which what can be spoken more effectually against the merits of condignity for if our good works be not our owne as from our selves how can hey merit of him whose gifts they are
if they were our owne and from our selves and were also perfect as they are not then perhaps it might be said that when god rewardeth them he rewardeth our merits but not being from our selves but meerely by his gift when he rewardeth them hee doth not reward our merits but crowne his owne gifts
it is plaine therfore that whereas august
considereth good works two wayes either as our merits or as gods gifts he both constantly denyeth eternall life to be rendred unto them as to our merits and also affirmeth that it is given to them freely as to the free gifts of god
and this is proved out of those very places which bellarmine alleageth in the first place he saith

cùm deu coronat merita nostra nihil aliud coronat quam muner a sa
when god doth crowne our merits so hee calleth good works he crowneth nothing else but his owne gifts and in another place

ergo coronat te quia dona sua coronat non merita ta and againe in the same epistle he saith

that howsowever eternall life is rendred to our good workes which hee therefore calleth merits yet because these good works or merits unto which it is rendred are not from our selves but from grace it selfe therefore is called grace non ob aliud

nisi quia gratis datur for no other cause but because it is freely given nor for that it is not given to merits or good works but because they themselves are given to which it is given
and againe that eternall life is the reward of true righteousnesse to which righteousnes if it were from our selves and were to bee found in us the reward should be due as the stipend thereof but being not from our selves but from the grace of god therefore to us eternall life is grace as being the free reward of grace to which as it is freely promised so it is freely given
and the like is to be said of the other places some wherof have before alleaged as being pregnant to our purpose
wherein as in innumerable other places augustine doth not speake of the workes of naturall men but of the workes of the faithfull and regenerate proceeding from grace to which not as to merits but as to the free gifts of god eternall life is freely given
and it is apparent that he speaketh of the faithfull who are in the state of salvation even then when they are to be saved

ut intelligeremus non pro meritis nostris deum nos ad eternam vitam sed pro sua miseratione perducere

and againe

cum pr aemium venerit sua dona coronabit non merita tua
and againe pro nihilo salvos facies illos nihil invenis unde salves multum invenis unde damnes

to these three will out of very many places which might be alleaged out of augustine· against the condigne merit of our workes adde a few more


for writing on those words psal

propter nomen tuum domine vivificabis me in justitia tua spoken in the future tence of a faithful and regenerate man viz the authour of that psalme in ua justitia saith he non in mea non quia eg merui sed quia tu miser eris nam si meum ostenderem meritum nihil abs te mererer nisi supplicium
in thy righteousnesse not in mine not because have merited but because thou hast mercie
for if should shew my merit should deserve of thee nothing but punishment


againe writing on those words of the
psalme

melior est misericordia tua super vias he saith multa sunt vit humana sed deus unicam vitam no illam dat nob qasi propter merita nostr sed propter misericordiam suam


si

vellet pro meritis ager non inveniret nisi quos damnaret


promisit

enim bminibus divinitatem mortalibus immortalitatem peccatoribs abjectis glorificationem quicquid promisit indignis non quasi operibs merces promitteretur sed gratia nomine so gratis quta hoc ip sum quòd justè vivit in quantum mo potest justè vivre non meriti ani sed beneficii est divini



meitis suis niil tribunt just non tribuerat tum nisi misericordia des



no

pro merito quidem accipies vitam ateram sed tantum pro gratia


debita

redditur poena damnato indebita gratia liberato ut nec ille se indig quer atur nec dignum se iste glorietur


si autem gratia utique nullis meritis reddita sed gratuita bonitate donata


and againe gratia evacuatur si non gratis donatur sed meritis redditur


iv
in the fourth place he citeth for us prosper by the halves or

not so much for in the beginning of that chapter which bellarmin citeth he speaketh of those who having lived in wickednesse are converted a little before their end and saith this happeneth ut indubitanter agnoscas gratuita esse dei munera icut nulla sunt tam detestanda faeinora quae possunt gratiae arcere donum ita nulla posse tam praeclara opera existere quibus hoc quòd gratis tribuitur per retributinis judicium debeatur
therefore no debt due to us from god no merit in us afterwards he saith that those who were sent into the vineyard at the eleventh houre did represent those who are called in the end of their life and that the lord did make them who came at the eleventh houre equall with those who wrought all day non lbori pretium solvens sed divitias bonitatis suae in es quos sine operibus elegit ffundens ut etiam hi qui in multo labore sudarunt nil amplius quàm novissmi acceperun intelligant donum se gratiae non operum accepisse mercedem not paying an hie to the labour but powring forth the riches of his bounty on them whom hee chose without workes that they also who tooke great paines and received no more than the last should understand that they received a gift of grace and not the wages of their worke
by the the equality of eternall life is signified as prosper teacheth as

bellarmine himselfe confesseth
and therefore it is not rendred as an hire or wages to mens labours for then the reward should have beene proportionable to the labour but as a gift of grace which the lord bestoweth according to his good pleasure matth



hee bellarmines answere that prosper denieth eternall life to be the wages of such workes or merits as goe before grace but granteth it to be wages of those which proceed from grace is not worth the refuting for the workes to which the was given were the workes of the labourers which they performed after their calling
unto which notwithstanding it was given not as the price or hire of the labour but as a gift of grace for if the reward was not the deserved wages of their workes but the free gift of their lord then their workes were not merits of their reward
but that prosper did not deny true merits which proceed from grace bellarmine saith it is plaine by the same place where he saith bona merita sequi in homine post adeptam gratiam non autem praecedere answere if hee had said so his meaning had beene the same with that which he learned of augustine that good workes doe not goe before but follow grace
but indeed there is no such saying of prosper in that place



the fifth is gregory the great on those words of iob si

habuer quippiam justum non sed meum judicem depreabor which it selfe is an excellent testimony against merits commenteth thus velut si apertius fateaur dicens si ad pus virtutis excr'vero ad vitam

non ex meritis sed ex venia convalesco as if he should more plainely confesse and say though grow up to the worke of virtue yet to life am enabled not by merits but by pardon
to this bellarmine giveth the same answere which he did to agustine and prosper which is that one and the same bush whereby he seketh to stoppe all gapps that he speaketh of such merits as wee have from our selves which neither are nor can be any
but to this place this answere cannot be applyed seeing gregory speaketh those words in the person of iob whose workes proceeded from grace he being the most gracious man that was then upon the earth

the same gregory writing on the seventh penitentiall

psalme speaketh to this effect
if that felicitie of saints be mercie and is not acquired by merits which hee had noted before out of the psalme what then shall become of that which is written and thou rendrest to every man according to his workes if it be rendred according to works how shall it be esteemed mercie but it is one thing saith he to render according to workes another to render for the workes themselves
for in that it is said according to workes the quality of works is meant that whose workes shall appeare to bee good his reward may be glorious
for to that blessed life wherein we live with god and by god no labour may be matched no workes compared especially seeing the apostle saith the passions of this time are not condigne to the future glory
where he teacheth these three things
first that eternall life is not gotten by merits no not of saints
secondly that it is not given for our workes as the meritorious cause though according to our workes
thirdly that our workes are not worthy of it and therefore cannot condigney merit it


vi
the sixt and last is bernard out of whom he citeth as objected

by us foure testimonies
the first de annunciat serm
where is an excellent passage against merits out of which bellarmine citeth for us one onely sentence
but will recite the whole place
now as touching life eternall we know that the passions of this time are not condigne to the future glory though

one man should sustaine them all
neither are the merits of men such that eternall life should bee due to them by right or that god should doe some injury if hee did not give it
for to omit that all our merits are gods gifts and so for them man is more a debtour to god than god to man what are all merits to so great glory finally who is better than the held it necessary to say unto god enter not into judgement with thy servant lord and a little after when hee had commended speciall faith whih the papists cannot abide he aith ipse peccata condonat ipse donat merita pramia nihilominus ispe redonat hee forgiveth our sinnes he giveth us merits or good workes and he neverthelesse giveth us the rewards

in which words are contayned six good arguments against merit of condignity

the first if the passions of this life even martyrdome it selfe are

not condigne or worthy to the future glory though one did beare them all then much lesse are our actions or good workes but the passions of this time though one man should sustayne them all are not condigne or worthy to the future glory therefore much lesse are our good workes worthy of that glory

secondly condigne merits are such that eternall life is due unto them by right insomuch as god should seeme to doe wrong if he did not bestow it as the papists most presumptuously teach but our good workes are not such as bernard here plainely testifieth therefore our good workes are not condigne merits of eternall life
thirdly those things which bee the gifts of god doe not merit of god yea they are so farre from meriting at the hands of god that they make men who have them debtours to god and not god to them
but our good workes which some call merits are all of them the gifts of god
fourthly betweene merits of condignity and the reward there is an equall proportion but what are all our good workes which they call merits to so great glory fifthly they who have condigne merits may boldly appeare before the judgement of god and challenge their due reward but the holiest man that liveth ought to say with david enter not into judgement with thy servant lord for no man living shall be justified in thy sight if thou enter into judgement with him
sixthly if god doth give unto us both our good works or merits and also the reward then our good workes doe not condignely merit everlasting life but the antecedent is true therefore the consequent
of these six bellarmine citeth onely the second and that onely he answereth viz that bernard teacheth that eternall life is not due to merits by right absolutely because they presuppose both the grace and the promise of god but grace and promise being presupposed eternall life is due by right which he would prove out of tim


and heb
reply bernard speaketh with presupposall both of gods grace and promise and teacheth that good workes though proceeding from grace though having the promise of reward yet to them eternall life is not due by right neither doe they merit it condignely as is proved by the six reasons whereof bellarmine answeareth never a one
for in th first reason he speaketh of the sufferings according to the apostles meaning of the sonnes and heires of god which they suffer for or with christ having this promise that if they suffer with christ they shall be glorified with him yet these though one man should sustaine them all are not condigne to the future glory
as for the second which he would seeme to answere instead of explaining it he plainely contradicteth it saying that our merits are such as eternall life is due to them by right

in the third argument bernard doth not onely presuppose that the good works or merits where of he speaketh doe proceed from grace

but from thence proveth that because they are gods gifts they cannot merit of god but the more a man hath of them the more he is indebted to god

in the fourth he sheweth that betweene all our workes though never so much proceeding from grace and the future glory which is promised to them there is no proportion
in the fifth he speaketh of them that are most godly who have both grace and promise of glory that they are so farre from condigne merit that if god should enter into judgement with them none of them could be justified in his sight

in the sixth he setteth downe the degrees of grace freely bestowed upon us that hee doth condonare peccata donare merita redonare praemia
of his grace hee forgiveth our sinnes of his grace he giveth us good workes which hee calleth merits of his grace redoubled upon us he graciously giveth the reward which hee hath freely promised as for his proofes out of tim

heb
shall answere in their due

place
unto this testimony bellarmine might have added another out of the same sermon
it is necessary first of all to beleeve that thou canst not have remission of sinnes but by the indulgence of god then that thou canst have no good worke unlesse he also give it lastly that by no good workes thou canst merit that is obtaine eternall life unlesse it also be freely given thee nisi gratis detur illa


vii
the other three places are these
first totum hominis

meritum est si totam spem suam ponat in eo qui totum hominem salvum facit
secondly proinde meritum meum miseratio domini
thirdly fateor non sum dignus ego confesse am not worthy neither can by mine owne merits obtaine the kingdome of heaven
but my lord possessing it by a double right the inheritance of his father and the merit of his passion contenting him selfe with the one hee giveth mee the other

to these three together bellarmine frameth two answeres
first that bernards meaning was that our merits are not of our selves but from gods mercy and that hee would prove out of his
sermon on the canticles merita habere cures habita data noveris
and therefore say his meaning was that our good workes doe not merit for being his free gifts they make us indebted to god as he teacheth and not him to us
but indeed bernard doth not speake of our workes or merits either as from us or as in us but of the mercy of god in pardoning our sinnes for the merit of his sonne
and therefore whiles god aboundeth with mercies in christ he saith hee cannot want merits
for mans justice is gods indulgence and therefore blessed is the man to whom the lord imputeth not sinne solus

verè beatus cuinon imputavit dominus enim mihi ad omnem justitiam solum habere propitium cui soli peccavi
omne quod mihi ipse non imputare decreverit sic est quasi non fuerit
nnpeccare dei justitia est hominis justitia indulgentia dei

his second answere is conjecturall that perhaps bernard out of humility and perhaps not was ignorant of his merits and out of the uncertainty of his owne grace did not trust in his merits but in the mercie of god alone

reply he knew that he had no merits but gods mercies in christ because he was not ignorant that he had many sins which notwithstanding he was confident in the mercies of god and merits of christ
neither was he so uncertaine of such inherent righteousnesse in himselfe as whereby he might hope to be justified and saved as hee was certaine of the contrary

as for his allegation out of the
serm· in cantic
it is evident th bernard by merits understandeth nothing but good workes and not merits properly so called as appeareth by that before alleaged ex serm
de annunciat and out of the same

serm in cantic
non est quod jam quaeras quibus meritis speremus bona presertim cum andias apud prophetam non propter vos sed propter me ego faciam dicit dominus which is no lesse than to deny merits and in one of the places by bellarmine

cited meum proinde meritum miseratio domini
non planè sum meriti inops quandiu ille miserationum non fuerit quòd si misericordiae dei multae mults nihilominus ego in meritis sum
but that famous testimony of his may not omit though have mentioned it before in the end of his booke degratia arbitr where he distinguishing the gifts of god into merita and praemia and therefore speaking of merits as proceeding from grace hee saith those things which wee call our merits that is to say good workes spei quaedam sunt seminaria charitatis incentiva occulta praedestinationis indicia suturae faelicitatis prsagia regni non caus regnandi they are certaine seminaries of hope motives of charity tokens of secret predistination presages of future felicity the way of the kingdome not the cause of reigning and therefore no meritorious cause of salvation


viii
and these were all the testimonies which bellarmine

taketh notice of as alleaged by us out of the fathers
but have not so done with them
for as in the question of justification by faith alone produced a multitude of testimonies to prove the consent of the ancient church with us so in this place that good workes are not truely meritorious of eternall life doe prove not onely by all those testimonies for if we be not justified by them wee are not saved for them but also by a new supply of testimonies which by divers learned men have been collected but chiefly by our most learned

primate whereof will recite so many as his

adversary hath meddled with that may briefly and as it were in transcursu vindicate them from his cavils
of these the first is

origen can hardly perswade my selfe that there can be any worke which may of duty or debt require the remuneration of god

seeing even that that we are able to doe to thinke or to speake wee doe it by his gift and bounty what debt then shall there be of his whose grace hath gone before from whence reason thus to no

gifts of his god is a debtour or oweth reward as due

all our good workes are his gifts therefore to none of our good workes is god a debtour or oweth reward as due
wherof the reason being because they are the gifts of god proceeding from his grace which precedeth our good workes hee is proved to bee ridiculum caput who answereth that origen speaketh of such workes as are done by the sole power of mans free will without grace


ix hilarie writing upon the parable of the workemen matth

having said that the gentiles who upon the preaching

of the gospell were to bee saved by the justification of faith were meant by those who being called at the eleventh houre were the first that in the evening received the gift of the wages appointed for the labour of the whole day he addeth these words
merces quidem ex dono nulla est quia debetur ex opere sed gratuitam deus omnibus ex fidei justificatione donavit
wages indeed by gift there is none because by the worke it is due but to all by the justification of faith god hath given the same free
whence argue no wages is of free gift
why because it is due to the worke

eternall life is of free gift which god giveth to all that beleeve by the justification of faith
therefore eternall life is not wages

mat yea but hilarie elsewhere saith that the kingdome of god

is the wages of such as live well
answ
it is merces indeed non debita sed gratuita not wages but a free reward
for so in this very place he calleth it first donum mercedis the gift of reward secondly gratuitum free thirdly in the words next following gratuitam mercedem a free reward and lastly hee saith that the gift of grace doth give the reward of the law well and blamelessely kept to them that beleeve by faith being of the last made the first that is saved
for the first which were made last who murmured at this free reward were of the many that were called

but not of the few which are chosen
absurd therefore is his answere who saith that hillarie saith no more but that faith and justification by faith is the free gift of god but that there is not a word to signifie that heaven is not the wages of good workes which notwithstanding is the thing to bee concluded from hence
so that according to this wife exposition by the wages which according to the parable is in the evening given to the labourers is faith or justification by faith meant and not eternall life which is the end of our faith and the reward of all our labours which according to the judgement of all writers even bellarmine himselfe is signified by the given to them who of the last were made first for the was both the mercenary wages contracted for by those who were first and the free reward which the bounty of the master of the vineyard bestowed freely on the last who were made first that is saved


ambrose after hee had said hîc quidem luctamur sed

alibi coronamur here we wrestle but elsewhere we are crowned lest he should seeme to arrogate unto himselfe as if by his wrestling hee deserved the crowne addeth by way of prevention spake not of my selfe alone but of all men in generall
nam unde mihi tantum meriti cui indulgentia pro corona est for whence should have so great merit to whom indulgence is for a crowne hence reason thus to whom gods indulgence or mercie in pardoning their sinnes is their crowne they cannot plead their merits but to ambrose and to all good men

indulgence is their crowne therefore they cannot plead their merits
wherefore this was not more humbly than truely spoken of ambrose
and elsewhere

which of us can subsist without mercie quid possumus dignum praemiis facere coelestibus what can wee doe worthy the heavenly what merit of man is it granted that this corruptible flesh should put on sufferings of this time are unworthy to the glory that is to come
therefore the forme of heavenly decrees doth proceed with men not according to our merits but according to gods mercie
to this a frivolous answere is given that ambrose speaketh of merits as contradistinguished from gods mercie when ambrose speaketh of himselfe and of all the faithfull who are endued with grace who notwithstanding are not able to doe or suffer any thing worthy of the future glory


xi basil on those wordes psalm


the eye of the

lord is upon them that hope in his mercy hee saith that he doth hope in his mercie who not trusting in his owne good deeds nor looking to bee justified by workes hath the hope of salvation onely in the mercies of god

to this an impudent answere is given that they are said to hope in gods mercie who hope that their good workes proceeding from the grace of god are by his mercie made meritorious of eternall life
for which they have have no ground either in scriptures or fathers praeter impudentiam asseverandi
and surely if this had beene basils meaning he should have set downe the description of a proud justitiarie rather than of an humble christian such as he intended to describe
for speaking of those words who hope in his mercie he saith undefined span alphabet the psalmist setteth forth the humility of them that serve the lord how doe they hope on his mercies for hee that doth not trust to his owne good deeds nor expecteth to bee justified by workes but hath his onely hope of salvation in the mercies of god but he that trusteth that by the grace of god his workes are made meritorious hee doth with the pharisee trust in his workes as proceeding from grace
for the pharisee though he acknowledged his righteousnesse to come from god and therefore thanketh him for it yet he is noted to have trusted

in himselfe
the mercie of god in which the faithfull hope is his mercie in forgiving their sinnes not in making their good workes meritorious as appeareth by the words immediately following for saith basil when he shall

call that saying to minde behold the lord and his reward to render to every man according to his worke and shall consider his owne evill deeds he is indeed afraid of punishment and through feare subjecteth

himselfe to those things which are threatned but that hee may not be swallowed up of sorrow undefined span alphabet he conceiveth good hope looking to the mercies of god and his love to mankinde undefined span alphabet and the hope which he conceiveth is this that his soule shall be delivered from death
but though they cannot answer this place yet they will clavum clavo petere and requite us with another out of basil which shall be answerd in his due place

in the meane time adde two other testimonies out of basil for writing on those words of the psalme and redeeme us for thy mercies sake
see saith he

how hee concludeth his speech
after a thousand virtues whence doth hee pray to be saved by gods mercie and bounty


and againe in psal

where david having descrybed the just and upright man who shall bee saved saith this man shall receive the blessing from god and mercy from god his saviour
here saith basil he sheweth the fruit of good deedes and very fitly did he conjoyne blessing and mercy
for the rewards which men doe thinke of are granted to men onely for gods bounty sake
for all the righteousnesses of men doe not equall so much as the gifts already granted much lesse those which are to come which doe exceed the thought of man


xii

hierome pro nihilo salvos facies eos haud dublum quin

qui on prprio merit sed dei salvantur clementia for nothing thou shalt save them no doubt he meaneth the just who are not saved by their owne merit but by the mercy of god


againe

animadverte quod beatam se dicat maria mater domini non merito atque virtute sed dei in se habitantis clementia
observe that the blessed virgin calleth her selfe blessed not by her owne merit or virtue but by the clemency of god dwelling in her


and againe

tunc justi sumus then we are just when wee confesse our selves to bee sinners and our righteousnesse consisteth not in our owne merit but in the mercy of god



god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble but where is grace it is not the retribution of workes but the largesse of the giver that the saying of the apostle may be fulfilled it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy


writing on those words

esai

thou art our father hee saith si nostra consideremus merita desperandum est si tuam autem clementiam
if wee consider our merits wee must despaire but if thy clemency who doest scourge every sonne whom thou receivest we dare powre forth our prayers



when the day of judgement or of death shall come all hands

will bee no worke shall bee found worthy gods justice and in his sight shall no man living be jstified namely if he enter into judgement with him whereupon the prophet saith in the pslme if thou lord observe iniquities who shall abide

to these two that answere is given that they speake of humane workes not assisted by grace when it is plaine that the former words are spoken in the person of gods children whose good workes are alwayes assisted by grace the latter of all men even of the best whose workes though proceeding from grace are stained with the flesh and therefore not worthy of gods justice


xiii
the same answere is given to the testimonies of

macaius and marcus the eremits which cannot bee so eluded

macarius speaking of the dignity of christians for whom god hath prepared a kingdome writeth thus as touching the gift therefore which they shall inherit a man might well say that if any one should ven from the creation of adam to the consummation of the world fight against satan and should suffer afflictions undefined span alphabet hee should doe no great matter in respect of the glory which he shall inherit

marcus among his twenty two

sentences concerning those who thinke to bee justified by workes which in the first entence hee calleth undefined span alphabet hath divers against merits whereof will cite a few

our lord saith he

when he would shew that the keeping of the whole law is undefined span alphabet debita to bee performed as a debt and that the adoption of sonnes is given by his blood hee saith when you shall have done all things that are commanded you say wee are unprofitable servants we have done what was our duety to doe undefined span alphabet therefore the kingdome of heaven is not wages or a mercenary reward of workes but the grace or free gift of the lord prepared for his faithfull servants

the

servant doth no require liberty undefined span alphabet as a deerved receiveth it undefined span alphabet as given by grace

some not doing the commandements thinke they beleeve well
others doing them looke to receive the kingdome undefined span alphabet as due wages undefined span alphabet both sorts misse the heavenly canaan

from lords no reward is due to servants undefined span alphabet neither doe they obtaine liberty unlesse they serve well

if christ dyed for us according to the scriptures and wee live not to our selves but to him that dyed for us and rose againe surely undefined span alphabet wee are bound as debtours to serve him utill death how then shall we esteeme the adoption or inheritance of sonnes undefined span alphabet due unto us


xiv
out of chrysostome many pregnant testimonies are alleaged first

in coloss homil

why doth hee call it undefined span alphabet lot or

inheritance by lot undefined span alphabet he sheweth that no man by his owne good workes doth obtaine the no man sheweth forth such a conversation that hee should bee worthy of the kindgdome but this is altoether of the gift of god wherefore he saith when you shall have done all say we are unprofitable servants for what things wee ought to doe wee have done
the same hath thephilact

to this you may adde that which cited before out of his treatise de compunctione ad stlochium and that which hee writeth in psal

and in his sermon de prim homine praelato mni creatur
in which it is said though we should die ten thousand deaths and should shew forth all virtue though we should performe ten thousand good workes yet we cannot performe any thing worthy of those honours bestowed upon us worthy of that heavenly kingdome or correspondent unto it but it is of his mrcie of his love of his grace that we are saved than which nothing can bee spoken more plaine against the merit of ondignity
to all which a senselesse answere is given that heaven is the free gift of god and yet is purchased by our merits which implyeth a contradiction within it selfe and is expressely repugnant to the scriptures rom·



and the reason which is given to prove it doth overthrow it because the good works which they call merits are the free gifts of god and therfore cannot merit of god as have shewed before


xv
to that which is alleaged out of the life of saint

anthny and out of augustine in psal
conc
in both which places is notably expressed the infinite disproportion betweene that we can doe or suffer which the papists call merits and the heavenly reward which evidently overthroweth the popish doctrine of meris as have heretofore proved it is answered that notwithstanding all this disproportion eternall life is given and justly given as the reward thereof
but the question is not whether god doth justly give the reward which he hath freely promised but whether we doe merit and deserve it
this answere therefore is frivolous

out of augustine have before produced manifold and manifest testimonies but yet because the papists alleage out of him two assertions which to them seeme contrary to that wee hold to wit that god is our debtour in respect of eternall life and that in justice he doth render it unto us will brefly cleare them
for first augustine

every where professeth that god is not a debtour unto us in respect of out desert but in regard of his gracious promise which proveth not our merit but the contrary
for what he freely promised without respect of our worthinesse or desert that hee also promised to give freely
and therefore eternall life when it is given according to his promise it is given freely and without our desert
god is a debtour onely in respect of his promise a debtour unto himselfe as have said before in respect of his trueth and fidelity it being

impossible that he should lie or deny himselfe but not a debtour to us in respect of our desert or dignity
or whatsoever hee hath promised us

he hath promised it to them that are unworthy as was alleagd befor out of augustine in psal
that it should not bee promised as a wages or a mercenary reward but being grace might according to the name be graciously given

againe it is just with god that hee should render to the faithfull eternall life not because they deserve it but because he hath promised it for what he hath promised he is faithfull and just to performe
but hee hath promised without respect of our desert to give it freely therefore it is just that he should freely give it to us and without our desert

theodoret the salvation of men dependeth on

gods mercie alone for wee doe not attaine unto it as wages but it is the gift of gods goodnesse wherefore the lord saith propter me salvabo will save for mine owne sake

to this the answere is shamelesse that this place maketh not for our purpose
and why for by salvation is not meant eternall life but of our first vocation wherof there is no shew
as though theodoret did contend that we doe not attaine to our first vocation by which we are as it were called into the vineyard as wages
and againe he speaketh of the church that is of them that are already called and no doubt but that by the same grace by which wee are elected called justified wee are also saved but that was free and undeserved and therefore so is this

againe

the crownes surpasse the fights the rewards are not to bee compared with the labors
for the labour is small but great gaine is hoped for and therefore hee called those things which are expected not wages but glory rom

and in rom

hîc non dicit mercedem sed gratiam heere hee doth not say wages but grace

it is answered that although the reward doe much surpasse the paines yet it is a just reward
no doubt
but why just not because it is equall as it ought to bee if it bee rendred to merit of condignity but because it is promised and accordingly given of god the righteeous iudge

prospers testimony

which bellarmine to whom his disciple

doth referre us sought to obscure was before cleared to bee most pregnant against the merit of good workes unto which wee may adde that on psal
upon these words who crowneth with mercy that we may understand saith he that by the same mercy the crownes of good workes which hee calleth merits are given by which were given the merits of the crownes that is freely and without merit or desert


xvii
and this was the doctrine of the primitive church for the first five hundred yeares and was continued in the next five hundred and in the third also as is plentifully proved by multitude of

testimonies in the said learned worke of our most learned primate unto which because his adversary giveth no answer will referre the chri stian reader citing onely a few of the latter times as it were for a taste
venerable bede

et hoc non ex meritis sed sola gratia
and thus that the godly man shall bee well rewarded is not by merits but by grace onely

haymo vita aeterna nulli per debitum redditur sed per gratuitam misericordiam datur eternal life is rendred to none by debt or duty but is given by free mercie

rupertus the greatnesse or eternity of heavenly glory is a matter not of merit but of grace

photius in rom

hee did not say that eternall life is undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet the wages of good workes but a free gift

oecumen in coloss


undefined span alphabet well did he call it undefined span alphabet as being a certaine inheritance and gift for the sufferings of this present time are not worthy rom

on which place also hee saith

the apostle sheweth that wee neither can suffer nor conferre any thing worthy the remuneration that shall bee there

conclude with

anselmus si homo mille annis serviret deo etiam ferventissimè non mereretur ex condigno dimidiam diem esse in regno coelorum
if a man should serve god a thousand yeares and that most fervently he should not condignely merit to bee halfe a day in the kingdome of heaven

chap
bellarmines dispute sirst concerning the name merit
secondly concerning the thing which he endevoureth to prove out of the scriptures



now we are come to bellarmines dispute concerning

merits
wherein he discourseth first of the name and afterwards of the thing it selfe
as

touching the name hee endevoureth to prove that it is grounded on the scriptures
and to this purpose he alleageth in the first place eccl



which he according to the vulgar latine translation readeth thus omnis misricordia faciet locum unicuique secundum meritum operum suorum all mercie shall make place for every one according to the merit of his workes
so that his first proofe is nothing but a corrupt translation of a testimony cited

out of an apocryphall booke
the words in the originall are these undefined span alphabet make way for every worke of mercie undefined span alphabet for every man shall finde according to his wokes that is saith bellarmine according to the merit of his workes

answ
but the phrae undefined span alphabet which is often used in the scripture as when it is said god will judge every man or he will render to every one according to their workes doth not import merit that the name of merit should thereon be grounded but the quality of mens workes whether good or evill that is hee will graciously reward them that have done well and he will severely punish those that have done evill and so it is expounded cor

according to that which hee hath done whether good or evill so rom

matth

ioh

this truth is acknowledged by

gregory the great it is one thing saith hee to render secundum opera according to workes and another thing to render propter ipsa pera for the workes themselves for in that which is said according to workes ipsa operum qualitas intelligitur the quality it selfe of the workes is understood that whose workes shall appeare to bee good his retribution also shall bee glorious which words were spoken by gregory in answer to an objection which is the same with bellarmines in this place
if the felicity of saints be mercie and not acquired by merits as you say what shall become of that which is written and thou shalt render to every man according to his workes
if it be rendred according to workes how shall it be esteemed mercie but saith he it is one thing to say according to workes whereby the quality onely is noted good or bad another for the workes themselves which noteth merit
but the scripture no where saith that god doth reward the godly prpter opera sua but thus it speaketh to thee lord mercie for thou rewardest every man that is every good man according to his work you see then that the objetion made against gregories assertion or rather davids is bellarmines the answer which gregory maketh is ours

yea but hierome saith bellarmine who was most skilfull in the three languages doth use to translate that which in the hebrew and greeke is according to workes by the word merit saying according to the merit of their workes

answ
if he did so that would not prove the use of the name merit in the scriptures but indeed he doth ot so for usually hee rendreth secundum opera according to their workes
indeed latine interpreters of latter times in the church of rome being poisoned with the popish doctrine of merits are very forward as might be shewed at large to oist in the word merit into their translations where the originall which they translate hath no such thing an instance whereof will hereafter give in the translatour of ignatius
the vulgar latine is more sparing howsoever gen

it rendreth the words of caines complaint thus major est iniquitas mea quam veniam merear my sinne is greater than can merit that is according to the ordinary use among the latines obtaine pardon for it cannot without great absurdity bee understood

of merit properly
howbeit the words are rather thus to bee rendred my punishment is greater than am able to beare which interpretation is proved by those reasons which cain useth in that place to aggravate not his sinne but his punishment
besides that place the verbe mereri is used but eight

times in the latine bible and alwaies in sense the worse viz deserving punishment and that is the proper sense for sinnes are properly merits of punishment and therefore to merit punishment is properly attributed to them
the nowne merit is used but thrice and that onely in the booke of ecclesiasticus that is to say besides this place in two others where it signifieth not merit of reward but worth or dignity as namely of the soule chap
of the men chap

so that the name merit taken in the popish sense for a good worke deserving the reward of eternall life hath no warrant at all not so much as in the latine vulgar translation and much lesse in the originall scriptures themselves


ii
his second testimony is heb
to doe good and to communicate

forget not talibus enim hostis promeretur deus for with such hosts say our rhemists god is promerited
the greeke word is undefined span alphabet unaptly and barbarously translated promeretur when as it properly signifieth is well pleased and the meaning is that such sacrifices are undefined span alphabet well pleasing or acceptable unto god
oecumenius expoundeth it by the word undefined span alphabet is pleased
but not all hings that please god doe merit of him
servants must bee undefined span alphabet well pleasing to their masters tit
and doe that which is pleasing in their sight who notwithstanding cannot merit any thing at their hands
so all our obedience in doing that will of god which is undefined span alphabet acceptable is pleasing to god and wee our selves in so doing are undefined span alphabet acceptable to god but when wee have done all things that wee can wee cannot merit so much as thankes but must confesse our selves to bee unprofitable servants in doing but that which was our duety to doe luk

here therefore nothing but a barbarous translation is alleaged to prove that which is not in the originall text
bellarmine though hee cannot deny it to bee barbarous yet he saith it is a very fit translation for most properly we say in latine that one man doth merit of another and oblige him to him to himselfe wh doth any thing whereby another is pleased or delighted
answere first that who so doth merit of another doth also please him but not whosoever doth that which is pleasing unto another doth also merit of him as said before of servants
secondly there is great disparity between god and man
one man may merit of another or oblige or make him beholding unto him
it is therefore a strange conceit of bellarmine because one man may merit of another by doing him a pleasure that therfore a man may mrit of god· or oblige him unto him
by doing good we profit our selves and others but we cannot profit god our goodnes reacheth not to him psal

can a man bee profitable unto god saith eliphaz is it any pleasure to the almighty that thou art righteous or is it gaine to him that thou makest thy way perfect iob

and so elihu iob

this translation therefore as it is barbarous

so it is impious in making god beholden unto us
yea but saith bellarmine this word being joyned with that of sacrifices
doth not onely signifie that god is delighted with good workes but that his favour is procured and hee induced to reward them that doe well
answer
the apostle doth not say undefined span alphabet god is made propitious or as bellarmine alleaging out of latine chrysostome placatur where the greeke is undefined span alphabet as in the text of the apostle
for the sacrifice of christ alone by it selfe is propitiatory the sacrifices of the law onely as they were types of it
as for the spirituall sacrifices whereof the apostle speaketh they are not undefined span alphabet propitiatory but onely undefined span alphabet acceptable and well pleasing in christ as being perfumed with the odours of his sacrifice
this therefore was but a poore and indeed a base shift which bellarmine was put to who finding no releefe in the originall text of the scripture is faine to flee unto corrupt translations as he doth not only in these two places already alleaged but also in that allegation of chrysostome for placatur and as afterwards wee shall see in citing ignatius and other greeke fathers


iii
and this is all the footing that the name merit hath in the scriptures
for though bellarmine adde two other arguments yet they belong not to the name but to the thing
so that here bellarmine might have begun his third chapter with this transition sed ut ad rem ipsam veniamus having spoken of the name let us come to the thing
for his other two arguments the one from the word dignity the other from the name reward used in the scriptures doe not prove the use of the of the name merit in the holy scriptures but serve in his conceit to prove the thing and are indeed two principall arguments which he bringeth to prove the merit of good workes which it shall suffice to answere in their due place
for doe not thinke them worthy of double

paines
only for the present answer to the first that where is speech of our dignity it is to bee ascribed to gods dignation as bernard well saith

digni nos sumus sedipsius dignatione non dignitate nostra wee are worthy but by his dignation or deigning to accept of us as worthy not by our own worthines secondly the words dignus and dignè sometimes do signifie not the equality of worth but that which is convenient meet or becomming as undefined span alphabet

undefined span alphabet col

undefined span alphabet thess


ioh
undefined span alphabet eph

undefined span alphabet phil



to the second thatthere are rewards free liberal and undeserved as wel as those which be mercenary and deserved and therfore the name of reward doth not alwaies presuppose merit or desert
to which purpose let the reader compare these paralell places mat

luk

where the words undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet are used in the selfe same sense
for if you love those that love you what reward have you quam mercedem habetis saith matthew quae vobis est gratia saith luke what thankes have you in the one is undefined span alphabet in the other undefined span alphabet
thus much of the name


iv
for the thing bellarmine bringeth three sorts of proofes

authority of scripture testimonies of fathers and reason
the authorityes of scripture he reduceth to seven heads
the first is of those places whre eternall life is called merces reward
his reason is thus framed if eternall life be the reward of good workes then good workes doe merit it but the former is true viz that eternall life is the reward good workes therefore the latter viz that good workes doe merit eternall life

answ
the proposition he taketh for granted all his proofe in this place being that sine dubitatione without doubt it is true
but in his second chapter he proved it by this which goeth for a maxie among them that merces and meritum are relatives
but answere by distinction
that merces reward is of two sorts
it is either debita due as justly deserved or gratita as freely bestowed and without desert as ambrose also distinguisheth
alia est merces saith hee

liberalitatis gratia aliud virtutis stipendium laboris remneratio which distinction is insiunated by the apostle rom

for reward is either imputed undefined span alphabet according to grace as the inheritance of an adopted sonne or rendred undefined span alphabet according to debt or duty as the hire or wages of an hired servant or labourer

who is worthy of his hire
and is acknowledged by

bellarmine
for when the apostle saith to him that worketh the reward is not imputed according to grace but according to debt satis aperitè indicat esse quandam mercedem qua imputari possit secundum gratiam non secundum debitum he doth plainely enough shew that there is a certaine reward which may bee imputed according to grace not according to debt
merces noftra saith

augustine gratia vocatur
si gratia est gratis datur
our reward is called gratia so the latine translateth undefined span alphabet if it be grace it is freely given
and againe

god hath sent a physitian hee hath sent a saviour hee hath sent him who should heale freely that is but little that hee should heale freely who should also give reward to them that are healed
nothing can be added to this benevolence
who is he that will say let me heale thee and give thee a reward
of this free reward wee have examples and testimonies in the holy scriptures as first that which bellarmine in the first place citeth

very impertinently to prove the name merit gen

where the lord saith to abraham am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward
psalm


heritage and reward used promiscuously
children are an heritage from the lord and the fruit of the wombe is his reward
and so merces and gratia as was noted before out of matth


and luk

such a reward is our inheritance in heaven which is therefore called the reward of inheritance col

and this most plainely appeareth in the antithesis which the apostle maketh betweene the reward of sinne and the reward of piety
the wages of sinne is death but eternall life is undefined span alphabet the free gift of god in iesvs christ our lord rom

but of this place we have spoken in our fourth testimonie whereby it appeareth that howsoever merces debita that is wages and merium are relatives yet merit and the reward of eternall life

or any other free reward are not relatives
among men wages hath place because the labourer deserveth it and he that hireth him is benefited by the labour and there is ordinarily a due proportion betweene the labour and the wages
but with god it is otherwise we can deserve nothing of him neither is hee benefited by our labours neither is there any proportion betweene our workes and the reward of eternall life
the proposition therefore though by him taken for granted is by us to be denyed



the assumption that eternall life is the reward of good

workes wee freely confesse so it bee understood of a free reward which as it was graciously promised so it is freely and undeservedly given
bellarmine therefore should have proved that eternall life is a mercenary and on our part a deserved reward
but of all the places which he quoteth both in the second and third chapters where the word meres is used not one doth prove eternall life to bee a deserved reward or imply the merit of condignity
as genes


am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward chron


your worke shall be rewarded prov

to him that soweh righteousnesse there shall bee a sure reward
for as hos

vi onely there may bee question of that place matth



call the labourers and give them their wages which bellarmin citeth in the third chapter and afterwards urgeth both in the same chapter and in the seventeenth and also nineteenth
and for as much as this place is often alleaged by the papists to prove that eternall life is the wages or hire due to good wokes will therefore shew first that it maketh not for them secondly that it maketh

against them
for the first affirme that from parables nothing can be proved that is besides the scope of them
the scope of this parable is to shew that many who are first shall be last and the last first and that many are called but few chosen as appeareth both by the last verse of the former chapter for proofe whereof this parable is· propounded for so he saith vers
for the kingdome of heaven
and also by the sixteenth verse of the chapter which is the reddition of the parable
so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few are chosen
the first are they who were called early in the morning and hired for a certaine wages or hire viz for a penny by the day
but the first in the sequele of the parable became the last
if therefore it bee alleaged that to these eternall life was given for the hire of their labour say it is not onely besides but also contrary to the scope of the parable which was to shew that those who were first clled were of the many that are called but not

of the few that are chosen and consequently not of the few that are saved
the penny therefore that was promised by the housholder and received by these workemen doth not signifie eternall life as saint

basill supposeth
for though they received the penny yet because they were called but not chosen they missed of eternall life
thus therefore argue eternall life was not received by these workemen for they were called and not chosen
the penny which was promised was received by these workemen vers
therefore the penny which was promised is not eternall life
and this may be gathered out of the parable it selfe
first because these wee meere hirelings who would not worke but for a certaine hire led onely by reward for the obtayning whereof they trusted in their owne merits
secondly because after they had received their penny they envied their fellow workemen whom the lord rewarded not according to their merits but according to his owne bounty to which they trusted and not to their owne merit
thirdly because they murmured against the housholder as if he had not dealt with them according to their desert who had wrought twelve houres and had borne the burden and the heate of the day
fourthly because being sharpely reproved by the lord of the vineyard they were sent away with indignation saying to one of them which was intended to all take that which is thine and bee gone but whither doth hee bid them goe basil gueseth whither they who be on the left hand shall be

commanded to goe
and this may further be proved by conference with the like place luk

where our saviour having told the iewes who were first called that they should bee excluded out of the kingdome of god and the gentiles from all parts of the world should be admitted saith and behold there are last which shall be first meaning the gentiles and there are first meaning the iewes which shall be last that is excluded out of the number of them that shall bee saved
for as elsewhere also he saith many are called matth


of which number was hee that comming without his wedding garment was cast into utter darkenesse vers
but few are chosen


vii
for the second that this parable maketh against them

prove thus
if this reward whatsoever it be were rendred according to merit and according to justice as a just and deserved reward then there would have beene a due proportion observed betweene the labour and the reward so that a greater reward should have been given to the greater labour and a lesse to the lesse
but here the unequall labours of of of of of one houre the same reward is given viz to every one a peny not according to the merit of the labourers for then dividing the penny into twelve parts to them that were called at the third hour nine parts of a penny to them that were called at the sixth houre halfe a penny to them at the ninth houre the fourth part of a penny to them at the eleventh houre but one twelfth part of a penny should have beene given but according to the good pleasure of the housholder who alleageth he might doe

with his owne what hee plealeth and therefore would give to him who wrought but one houre and that in the coole of the day as much as to him that wrought twelve having bone the burden and the heate of the day
whereupon

prosper as you have heard inferreth that whereas god did make those who were called at the eleventh equall with the first he did it to commend the excellencie of grace not paying a price or hire to their labours but powring forth the riches of his bountie upon them whom he chose without workes that they also who tooke great paines and received no more than the last might understand that they received a gift of grace and not wages of workes
for as rdulphus

ardens speaking of these words vers
diddest thou not agree with me for a penny let no man saith he thinke that god is by covenant as it were bound to us to pay what he hath promised
for as god is free to promise so also he is free to pay especially seeing as well the merits as the rewards are his grace
for god in us doth crowne nothing but his owne grace who if he would deale strictly with us there would no man living bee justified in his sight
whereupon the apostle who had laboured more than they all saith reckon that the sufferings of this time are not condigne to the future glory shall bee revealed in us ergo hac canventio nihil alid est quàm voluntaria dei promissto therefore this agreement is nothing else but gods voluntary promise

ferus also writing on these words saith this parable doth teach us that it is grace and not debt whatsoever is given unto us of god and that where is no debt or duty but all is given of grace there no wrong is done

and further that you may see how little this parable maketh for wee may observe that as divers of the fathers understood by the first the iewes at least the justitiaries among them who the lord having made a covenant with them of workes that for their dayes labour hee should give them a penny expecting reward according to their merit were of the first made last so by the last the faithfull among all nations with whom the lord hath made the covenant of grace not promising to pay them according to the merit of their worke but to

give them what to him should seeme just according to the covenant of grace which promiseth the reward of keeping the whole law to them that truely beleeve who expecting reward not according to their owne merit but according to the grace

and good pleasure of god in whom they trusted were of the last made the first
so farre is this parable from proving thatet ernall life is given to men according to the merit of their workes that it proveth that the reward which is given is freely given and that those who seeke obtayne eternall life by their owne desert doe misse of it


viii
but here bellarmine cavilleth with the answeres of

melancthon and calvin who as is it seemeth understanding as the most doe by the the equall reward of eternall life doe answere first that it may be called merces a reward in regard of the

promise which it selfe is free of that which is freely given and therefore is a reward of grace and not of merit secondly because it is the reward of the inheritance

which though given in gods purpose before all times to those whom hee hath elected in christ without respect of workes yet to draw us unto obedience and to fit us for our inheritance he hath promised it as a free reward of our faith and obedience to the first bellarmine replyeth that the reward is given to the workes which is the condition of the promise and not to the promise it selfe
rejoyne that it is given to the works according to the promise that is as a free reward

to the second hee saith that eternall is more properly called reward than inheritance
answere primarily it is the inheritance intended before all time in christ without respect of workes and in the fulnesse of time purchased by christ and so promised to all the faithfull and yet in a secondary respect that we might be allured to obedience and to good workes by which we might be fitted for that heavenly inheritance into which no uncleane thing can enter it is also promised as a gracious reward freely given of god not merited by us
even as a father having adopted a sonne thereby intending to him and indeed entitling him to his inheritance should upon his obedience either already performed or to be performed promise to make him his heire
in this case who seeeth not that although the sonne come to his fathers patrimonie both as his inheritace and as a reward yet the prime title is the right of inheritnce· the second is the title of free donation
but of merit though the sonne behave himselfe never so well no title at all
neither is that the more honourable title as bellarmine here absurdly avoucheth unlesse that we rre to thinke that the mercenary title of an hired servant is more honourable than the hereditary title of a sonne
for this is all the honour which by their doctrine accrueth to the children of god that they turne the adopted sonnes of god into mercenary servants and the inheritance of sonnes into the wages of servants
but of this heretofore

ix others perceiving that the equality of reward rendred to labours so unequall as of twelve houres and of one cannot stand

with justice if rendred as in justice due for it is just where the reward is of duety that the greater labour should receive the greater reward howbeit as you heard out of ferus where all is of grace no wrong is done for may not doe with mine what pleaseth mee

saith the master of the vineyard have sought out another evasion
that they who were called at the eleventh houre and so wrought but one houre laboured as much as the first who laboured all the day which is not worth the confuting
for if in one houre they laboured as much as the other in twelve then deserved they as great a reward at the least
why then did their fellow labourers expect a greater reward why did they murmure at their lords unequall dealing and why did not the lord himselfe plead that equall reward was

to bee given to equall labours why did he plead his right to doe with his owne what he pleaseth but that he would have it understood that the reward by him given was not of duety but of grace not rendred as a debt out of duety but given as a free reward out of his owne bounty and as bellarmine himselfe saith

non ex justitia sed ex liberalitate
this fiction therefore never heard of before was by maldonate

devised for a poore shift in a desperate cause

bellarmines second argument is taken from those places

wherein it is taught that the heavenly reward is given to men according to the measure and proportion of their workes and labour
his argument is thus to be framed

what is given according to the measure and proportion of workes that the workes doe merit eternall life is given according to the measure and proportion of workes therefore workes doe merit eternall life

the proposition he proveth because if the reward be given according to the proportion of workes then there is regard had in giving that reward not onely of the promise or of the bounty of the rewarder but also of the dignity of the workes
the assumption he confirmth by divers texts of scripture as psalm


thou shalt render to every man according to his workes
mat

the sonne of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall render to every one according to their workes
luk

with the same measure that you mete it shall be measured to you againe

cor

behold come quickly and my reward is with me to render to every man according to his workes

xi
before apply mine answer to the parts of his syllogisme

am to propound a twofold distinction concerning the reward of our inheritance
first that it may bee considered either as our inheritance or as our reward
secondly that it may be considered in respect either of the substance of it as it is eternall life or of the degrees of glory therein
as it is our inheritance as it is eternall life it is one and the same equally given to all that ae saved and not given unequally according to the proportion of our virtues or workes
it is one and the same first in respect of the same meritorious cause which is the merit of christ
for as by his righteousnesse we are equally justified so by his merits we are equally saved equally made partakers of that inheritance which by the same price of his mrits is equally purchased for all that truely beleeve
secondly it is one and the same objectivè in respect of the same object it being the vision or fruition of the same god who is the chiefe good
thirdly in respect of continuance in regard whereof it is called eternall life which is one and the same to all being the same everlasting inheritance and the same ternall fruition of

god and fellowship which we shall ever have with christ and by him with the whole trinity
but however eternall life in respect of the substance be on and the same equally procured by the merit of christ yet it is not to be doubted that there are divers degrees of glory where with god doth crowne the divers degrees of grace which he hath bestowed on his children in this life
for although all that shall bee saved shall have fulnesse of felicity so much as they are capable of yet some are more capable than others
even as vessels of divers measures being put into the sea will all be fll of liquor according to their capacity yet some will containe a greater quantity than others
so all the saints though all full of happinesse yet shall not all bee endued with the same measure of glory but according to their capacity
this is that which heretofore alleaged out of

ambrose that god doth give to all that are saved aequalem mercedem vit non gloriae equall reward of life not of glory
these things thus premised answere first by denying his proposition
for although according to the proportion both of habituall grace and of actuall obedience which we call good workes the degrees of glory in the life to come shall bee bestowed yet these degrees are not thereby merited but god doth graciously crowne his greater graces which hee freely bestowed in this life with a greater measure of glory in the life to come
besides bellarmin and other papists doe teach that god crowneth our good workes supra condignum therefore those crownes cannot be merited ex condigno
secondly deny his assumption averting that eternall life it selfe is not bestowed according to the proportion of our workes but as it is wholly merited by the obedience of christ so is it equally bestowed upon all the faithfull who are equally justified by the merits of christ

xii
but here bellarmine cavilleth with two answeres given

as he saith by our divines the former that divers rewards are given to good workes both in this life and in the world to come but not eternall life it selfe against which he proveth that good workes are rewarded with eternall life and that there are no rewards in the world to come which doe not belong to eternall life
whereas no doubt the meaning of those who gave that answere was this that there are divers degrees of rewards given both in this life and in the world to come as namely the divers degrees of glory but there are not divers degrees of eternall life that is one and the same to all that are saved
we doe not deny but eternall life is the reward of good workes and therefore bellarmine might have spared his paynes in proving that which we doe not deny but we deny it to be given in divers degrees according to the proportion of mens workes
the other answere that etrnall life is to given to good workes no otherwise bt as they are signes of faith which also hee solemnely disputeth against utterly mistaking the matter
for first wee say that god doth graciously reward the virtues and

obedience of his owne children not as their merits but as his graces
secondly we say indeed that in the gospell eternall life is promised to those that beleeve without respect of workes and damnation denounced gainst those that beleeve not but because both faith and infidelity are inward and hidden and many deceive themselves with an inward opinion and an outward profession of faith therefore the lord at the last day will proceed in judgement according to the evidence of mens workes
so that the lord pronounceth the sentence according to workes as the signes and evidence of faith but rewardeth both faith and them as his owne gifts and graces
howbeit more properly eternall life it selfe is rendred to the righteousnesse of faith which is the righteousnesse and merits of christ imputed to them that beleeve by which the faithfull are equally justified and equally entituled to the kingdome of heaven but the degrees of glory are given according to the degrees of our sanctification that is to the degrees both of the habits of faith and other graces and of the acts and exercise thereof which wee call good workes
all which being gods owne free gifts hee doth freely reward crowning his greater graces with greater glory

xiii
as for the places of scripture which testifie that god will reward men according to their workes answere that secundum

opera according to workes doth not signifie the proportion but the quality of workes as have shewed before out of gregorie

that is as in some of the places it is expressed good workes are to

be rewarded with glory evill with punishment rom

cor


and so is that gal

to be understood as the apostle explaineth himselfe vers
that as every man doth sowe so he shall reape viz he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reape corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reape

everlasting life
the allegation out of luk

is impertinent as appeareth by his paralell mat

iudge not that you be not judgd for with what judgement ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure you mete it shall be measured to you againe
for first it seemeth to speake of humane judgement that as wee judge others so we shall be judged of others according to the

law of like for like
secondly it speaketh of active judging in the worse sense which is therefore forbidden and the reason is from the like judging passive

as an evill though just reward thereof so farre is it from speaking of the reward of eternall life
or if the place should be generally understood of mens judging well or ill and of their being judged according either by god or man nothing else can necessarily be gathered but the like judgement in quality that is either good or bad

and the like is to be said of cor

where the apostle doth not spake of the eternall reward either of life or death rendred to good or evill workes according to the proportion thereof but of the blessing of increase which god giveth to those that are planters or waterers in his garden as a reward of their labours
by planters

he understandeth himselfe and other apostles who were the planters of the church by waterers apollo and other evangelists and preachers who fed the church with their doctrine
the reward of their labours who are gods workemen vers
labouring for him and not for themselves is the blessing of increase which god giveth thereunto
even as the harvest is the reward of the earing not to be asscribed to the merit of earing but to the blessing of god
and so it is here plainely said though the planter and the waterer shall have their owne rewards yet their reward is not to bee asscribed to the merit of their labour but to the blessing of god
have planted saith paul and apoll hath watered but god gave the increase
so then neither he that planteth is any thing nor he that watereth but god that giveth the increase or if the place should generally be understood all workes both good and bad the meaning would be that the reward would be answerable either good or bad
that of the psalmist psal

to thee lord mercie for thou rendrest to every man according to his worke is not generally to be understood of the workes of all men both good and bad for the bad works of the wicked hee doth not reward in mercie but judgement without mercie shall bee executed upon them but of the good workes of the godly onely which though they bee good and acceptable to

god in christ yet he rewardeth them not according to merit but according to his mercie
the place apc

may be an exposition of the rest
for whereas in the rest it is said that god will judge undefined span alphabet according to their deds here christ saith he will render to every one undefined span alphabet as his worke shall be viz good or bad
but here the papists would seeme to bring a reason pari that as the wicked are damned prpter peccata for their evill workes so the godly are saved propter opera bona for their good workes
and as vill workes merit hell so good workes pari ratione merit heaven
answ it is impar ratio there is no equality in the comparison for first the scripture plainely teacheth that by and for their evill works men are condemned and as plainely denieth that by or for good workes men are saved
ephes


tit

secondly any one sinne meriteth death because it is a breach of the law yea of the whole law iam

but not any one good worke can merit heaven because it is not the fulfilling of the whole law for there must be a concurrence of all duties
in so much that if a man should performe all the commandements and faile in one the breach of that one maketh him guilty of all
thirdly evill workes are

purely and perfectly evill and therefore absolutely deserve death but the good workes are not purely and perfectly good as have heretofore prooved therefore death is the due stipend of sinne but eternall life is the free gift of god
fourthly sinne is absolutely meritorious of damnation but so is not our obedience of salvation
for though we could performe all the commandements by a totall perpetuall and perfect obedience yet wee must acknowledge our selves unprofitable servants

and much lesse could we merit thereby because we have done but our duety and where is no more but duety there can bee no merit
debitum non est meritum

xiiii
his third argument is taken from those places which do so testifie eternall life to be rendred to good workes that they place the very reason why eternall life is given in good workes
the places bee these matth


come ye blessed of my father possesse the kingdome prepared fr you from the beginning of the world for was hungry and you gave mee meat and in the same chapter vers
because thou hast beene faithfull in few things apoc

these are they who came out of great tribulation therefore they are before the throne of god
in which places the particles enim quia ideo for because therfore are all causall
his reason standeth thus to what things the causall particles are applied they are causes of that to which they have relation as namely of salvation

to workes of charity the causall particles are applied therefore workes of charity are causes of salvation

to the proposition answere that causall particles doe not alwaies nor for the most part signifie causes so properly called
for that is a grosse erour of the papists as noted before
the word cause sometimes is used properly to signifie that argument which hath relation onely to its effect by virtue whereof the effect hath its being either as from the efficient or as of the matter or as by the forme or as for the end
sometimes it is used generally to signifie any argument or reason whatsoever which is not the cause of the thing or of the being of that whereof it is said to bee a cause but of the consequence or conclusion and thus the rendring of any reason is called undefined span alphabet a rendring of the cause though perhaps it bee from the effect or any other argument
and forasmuch as persons are discerned and knowne by their effects for as our saviour saith by their fruits you shall know them therefore it is usuall in the scriptures from the effect to argue and declare the cause as thus god is mercifull for hee rewardeth the godly according to their workes
god is just for hee rewardeth the wicked according to their sinnes
this man is elect because he truely beleeveth and repenteth this man truely beleeveth because hee is fruitfull of good workes
this is a good tree for it bringeth forth good fruite
to the woman that was a sinner

much was forgiven for shee loved much
in those and infinite more examples the cause or reason which is rendred is from the effect
therefore the proposition is false


xv
now let us consider the places of scriptnre which hee alleageth and first matth


for when was hungry
this reason which is alleaged is not from the cause as if good workes were the meritorious cause of our inheriting the kingdome of heaven but from the effect to prove the cause which is expressed verse
as have shewed

before for for what cause are men to be saved first because they are blessed of the father that is justified and therefore entituled to this kingdome
secondly because they are elected and

therefore this kingdome was prepared for them from the beginning
thirdly because they ar the heires of god for whom our saviour purchased this inheritance noted in the word undefined span alphabet irit
but how shall it appeare who they are that are blessed and justified for whom this kingdome is prepared for whom this inheritance is purchased by the fruits of justification election redemption and namely by the workes of mercy and chariy towards the poore members of christ according to which as the evidence our saviour christ will judge
and thus his reaso standeth those who are blessed of god that is justified for whom this kingdome wa prepared and this iheritance purchased they are to inheri this kingdome

but you are such as appeareth by the fruits for your excercising the workes of charity and mercy towards my poore members and that for my sake is a plaine evidence of your election justification and redemption and accordig to this evidence judge of you come therefore inherit the kingdome
but to this allegation have answered twice

before

the second place is out of the same

chapter verse
in which there is no causall particle epressed in the originall neither is it any desert but duety of the servant to be faithfull neither any debt or duety of his lord but his houy and largesse in rewarding of his fidelity in few things with making him ruler over many things

the third place is apoc

thes hey who came out of great tribulation therefore they are the throne of god in alleaging whereof bellarmine leaveth out that which is most mariall that they had washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lambe undefined span alphabet therefore they are before the throne of god which sheweth that they stood before the throne of god not in their owne merits but in the merits of christ by which they were justified
that which is said of their tribulation doth not insinuate their desert as though thereby they had deserved to bee before the throne of god but the order of their afflictions going before their glorification and the consecution of eternall life following thereupon for as it is said of our saviour phil

that hee having humbled himselfe unto death the lord did therefore exalt him verse
and luke

that hee was first to suffer those things and so to enter into his glory so of the faithfull it is likewise said that through much tribulation they must enter into the kingdome of god act


and this is the answere which calvin

giveth to some of these places that they signifie ordinem consequentiae magis quam causam
for whom god hah appointed to salvation for them he hath prepared the way of

obdience and

patience that therein they make walke towards their countrey which is eaven good workes therefore and afflictions are not the cause of salvation but the way to it


xvi
but saith bellarmine christ could not more plaiely have expressed that good workes are the causs of salvation than when hee said for when was hungry you did especilly seeing hee seth the same forme of

fpeech against the wicked for was hungry and you did not
in which the cause of damnation is noted
answere that our saviour if hee had meant that good workes are the meriorious cause of salvation hee was able to have expressed it in as plaine termes as bellarmine dothbut his intent in these reasons which hee giveth was not to set downe the causes of salvation or damnation but the notes and markes of them who are to bee saved or condemned as the evidence according to which hee pronounceth sentence
yea but bellarmine will prove that the particles for and because are truely causall
by what reason forsooth by a circular augmentation becse good workes are causes
and how did hee prove good workes to be causes because these particles are causall
to prove that workes be causes meaning meritorious causes he alleageth three texts of scripture cor

gal


phil


two whereof discussed before in their due place where he endevoured to prove that good workes ae necessary necessitate efficitiae as causes of salvation viz cor

lib
cap



and of this eighth booke cap



and phil


lib
cap



that of gal


he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reape life everlasting maketh against him rath than for him
for as in the naturall harvest the increase is not to be ascribed to the ploughing and sowing but to the blessing of god so much more in the spirituall


xvii
but that these particles are not alwaies truely and properly

causall calvin sheweth by a notable instance
god had promised abraham when hee first called him out of vr that in him that is in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed
this promise the

lord often renewed as appeareth in his story which againe hee confirmeth by oath gen


when abraham had upon tryall in an excellent manner and measure approved both his faith and obedience unto god
by my selfe have sworne saith the lord that because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy sonne thine onely thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed becaus thou hast obeyed my voice
here both in the beginning of the oath and in the end the causall particle is used shall wee therefore say that abrahms obedience did merit that all the nations of the earth that is abraham himselfe and all the faithfull in all nations should bee blessed in the promised seed god had long before made this gracious promise to abraham without respect of this or any other his workes and had this act of obedience never beene the promise of the promised seed in his posterity would have beene performed so that the grace and love of god was the onely cause why hee promised to send his owne sonne who should take on him the seed of abraham and not abrahams obedience
all that can truely bee said is that upon this obedience god tooke occasion to renew his promise and to confirme it by oath for the further confirmation of abrahams faith
so that his obedience was so farre from being the cause of the thing promised as it was but the occasion of renewing the promise
but bellarmine in this example mentioneth onely that inferiour promise concerning the multiplication of

abrahams seed and saith that as god did promise it so he would have him to merit it by his good workes even so the lord having predestinated all the elect unto glory yet his pleasure is that they should attaine unto it by their owne merits
which cleane overthroweth the grace of election which which was without respect of workes and also of salvation
for if our election or salvation be of workes or merits then is it not of grace
and if this answere of bellarmine be good then may it in like manner bee applyed

to that part of the oath concerning the promised seed namely that abraham by his obedience had merited that in the promised seede the faithfull of all nations should bee blessed which is no better than blasphemy
it is true that god hath elected us that wee might bee

holy and that by the

sanctification of the spirit we might bee fitted for his kingdome and receive the

inheritance among those that are sanctified
and this holinesse is so necessary a property and cognizance of them that shall bee saved as that without it no man

shall see god wherefore hough it bee not the cause as have shewed heretofore yet it is the way to the kingdome and consequently causa sine qu non
and therefore that wee may bee stirred up to seeke after holinesse which is so necessary the lord in aboundant mercie hath promised eternall life thereunto as the reward whereby hee doth superaboundantly recompence all our service and obedience and most graciously crowne his owne gifts and graces in us
yea but saith bellarmine god in like maner promised children to saack yet his pleasure was that hee should obtaine them by the merit of prayer
reply that a man should merit by prayer is as absurd as to imagine that a poore man who hath nothing doth by his begging merit almes
it is true that when god promiseth good things unto us as the end wee are to use those meanes which god hth preordained whereof prayer is a principall and to walke in that way which leadeth to that end but those meanes are no merits nor that way no cause of obtaining that which god as hee hath graciously promised so hee freely bestoweth


xviii
the fourth argument is from those testimonies where

the reward is said to bee rendred to good workes out of justice as thess


we glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and fath in all your persecutions and tribulations which you sustaine for an example of the just judgement of god and after vers
if yet it bee just with god to repay tribulation to them that vexe you and to you that are vexed rest with us
tim


have fought a good sight have consummate my course have kept the faith
concerning the rest there is laid up for me a crowne of justice which our lord will render to me at that day a just judge
heb

god is not unjust that hee should forget your worke
iam

blessed is the man that suffereth tentation for when he hath beene proved he shall receive the crowne of life
apoc

bee thou faithfull untill death and will give thee the crowne of life
hereto also saith hee belong those places pro


foeneratur domino he lendeth as it were upon usury to the lord who hath piy on the poore cor
know you not th they which runne in the race all runne indeed but one receiveth the price so

runne that you may obtaine
tim


am sure that he is able to keepe my depositum unto that day
for he should doe wrong who should either not repay that which was lent or not pay the prize to him that overcommeth or not restore the depositum that is the thing which is committed to his trust for all these include justice
his argument is thus to be framed

that reward which god in justice rendreth to good works is merited by them eternall life is a reward which god in justice rendreth to good works therefore eternall life is merited by them

the proposition he taketh for ranted the assumption hee proveth by all those testimonies which he hath alleaged


xix
but first answere to his proposition by distinguishing

the word justice which is taken either universally

comprehending all morall virtues and so it is all one with gods goodnesse both as hee is good in himselfe and as hee is good to his creatures comprising the bounty and therein the love the grace and mercie of god as well as that which more properly is called his justice
so that what good things is rendred accoring to this justice is not therfore merited

more particularly justice is either in word or deed
god is just in his word both in respect of his precepts which are just

as a just lawgiver and also in respect of his promises in performance whereof hee is

faithfull and

just
for it is a just thing for any to stand to his promises yea as the oratour saith

fndamentum est justiti fides
hence in the scriptures faithfull and just are sometimes joyned as synonyma ioh
if wee confesse our sinnes he is faithfull and just to forgive us our sinnes
and in this sense god is said to be just when hee doth render unto us that which he hath promised
so in the places alleaged tim


heb

iam

hee is just also in his workes psal



for god doth whatsoever he willeth

and whatsoever he willeth that is just
this justice by philosophers is distinguished into distributive and commutative both observing equality the former geometricall the later arithmeticall
but this distinction doth not agree to the justice of god in respect of the later branch which consisteth in commutation that is in mutuall giving and receiving
for god giveth all things to all act


but receiveth not any thing from any
rom
as have said before and therefore cannot be a debtour to any but to himselfe in regard his promise
thus then the justice of god which is in fact may more fully be distinguished that it is either disponens or remunerans disposing either as a just but most free and absolute lord of all or as he is the just god the creatour governour and preserver of all things
remunerating as he is the just judge
as a most free and absolute lord hee disposeth things according to his absolute will and pleasure
who possessing

all things by full and absolute right may according to his pleasure dispose of them doing with his owne what he pleaseth rom

matth


as hee is the just god that is the creatour preserver and governour of all hee disposeth of all things according to his goodnesse mat


giving all good things

to all not universa singulis but such as are agreeable and fitting to all according to their severall kind nature and quality
and from this justice the order of the whole vniverse dependeth
this goodnesse os god sometimes in the scripture is called his justice psal

and so translated by the
gen



exod

esai

and this justice is by the said
rendred mercie
deut



psal





esai

dan




and as he is god of all and just to all in giving to all those good things which belong to them so is he after a more peculiar manner the god of the faithfull gen

even the god of their righteousnesse psa

as their justifier and saviour by the righteousnesse of god

and our saviour iesus christ by imputation whereof he is just in justifying us rom

and in remitting our sinnes psal

ioh

and accepting of us as righteous in christ unto eternall life and to this justice of christ and not to ours doth the lord in justice as a just iudge render eternall life being no lesse just than mercifull in saving us
and in this justice of god as well as his mercie· are wee to repose our affiance both for our justification and salvation
for if wee truely beleeve in christ we have in him satisfied gods justice in him we have fulfilled the law and therefore remission of sinnes and eternall life is in justice due unto us not for any merits of ours but for the merits of christ
there remaineth the remunerating or distributive justice of god as a just iudge judging the world in righteousnesse psal

and rendring to every one according to the quality of their works psal

rom

ier

for it is just with god to reward the righteousnesse of the righteous and to punish the sinnes of the wicked as in the place alleaged thess


and psal

mat

tim


exod

and this justice is distinguished according to the quaity of the persons towards whom it is exercised for towards the godly it is justitia liberans beans of which psa



deliver me in thy righteousnesse and towards the wicked vindicans or puniens psal

exod





the proposition therefore is not true unlesse it bee understood of commutative justice which belongeth not to god
for the reward which god giveth to good workes if it bee according to his universall justice it is to bee ascribed not to our merits but to his goodnesse
if according to his justice in word not to our merits but to his fidelity
if according to his justice as he is absolute lord not to our merits but to his good pleasure
if according to his justice as he is creator not to our merits but to his bounty
if according to his justice as hee is the god of our righteousnesse not to our merits but to the merits of christ
if according to his remunerating justice not to our merits but to his liberality

answ
god may bee said in justice to render reward either in respect of the worthinesse or desert of the worke or in some other respect if not in that respect or if in any other respect it argueth not merit
but not in that respect for all our workes are unperfect and

stayned with the flesh and no way in worth comparable to the reward but in other respects as first in regard of his promise which it is just with him to performe secondly in regard of christs merit applyed to us


xx
come to the assumption which understood of commutative

justice is not true of others it is to no purpose
let us then examine his proofes whereof not one doth prove the question
for as touching the first viz thes

we have said that it is just in respect

of gods remunerative justice by which hee rendreth to every one according to the quality of their workes to recompense tribulation to the wicked which persecute the church and to the godly who are troubled rest with the saints
the second tim


it

is just with god when the faithfull have fought a good fight have finished their course have kept the faith that he should render unto them the crowne of righteousnesse both according to his fidelity in performing his promise for it is just that the crowne which hee hath promised to the faithfull hee should give them having kept the faith and also according to that righteousnesse as he is the god of our righteousnesse that is the justifier and saviour of all that beleeve
for it is just that the righteous judge should give to the apostle having kept the faith that crowne of righteousnesse which god hath promised and which christ hath purchased and which in respect of christ his merit and righteousnesse imputed is in justice due not onely to the apostle but to all the faithfull who are described by this note that they love his comming
if it bee demanded why it is called the crowne of righteousnesse

bernard shall informe us
est ergo quam paulus expectat corona justiiae sed justitiae dei non suae
it is therefore a crowne of justice which paul expecteth but of gods justice not his owne
for it is just that he should render what he oweth and he oweth what he hath promised
and this is the justice whereof the apostle presumeth the promise of god
the third heb


god having promised that he would be

mindefull of his servants he is not unfaithfull to breake his promise nor unjust to forget them
but what is this to the purpose or that which followeth iam


that when a man is by bearing affliction found to be undefined span alphabet approved he shall receive the crowne of life which god hath promised to all that love him or that apoc

where to him that is faithfull unto

death the lord promiseth to give out of his gracious bounty a crowne of life

as touching those places which concerne loane the prize and the depositum in all three it is presupposed in the very nature of the contracts that a promise is made by the borrower by the master of the game by the depositary that the thing borowed is at the day of payment to be restored the prize is to bee given to him that winneth it and the depositum is to be rendred when the depositor doth demand it and therefore that it is just that the promise in every one should be performed
and even so

paul in the last place as

bernard hath

well observed dei promissum suum appellat depositum quia credidit promittenti fidener promissum repeit promissum quidem ex misericordia sed jam ex justitia persolvendum calleth gods promise or that which he promised his deposum and because he beleeved the promiser he doth confidently call for the thing promised promised indeed in mercie but now in justice to be rendred


xxi
his fifth argument is taken from those testimonies

wherein eternall life is promised to good workes as math


if thou wilt enter into life keepe the commandements and vers
every one that shall leave house or father hee shall receive an hundred fold and shall possesse eternall life
tim


godlinesse is profitable for all things having the promise of this life and of that which is to come iam

he shall receive the crowne of life which god hath promised to them that love him
now saith hee a promise made with the condition of a worke doth not onely make the thing promised a debt for he that promised is bound to stand to his promises but also causeth that hee who shall fulfill the worke may be said to have merited the thing promised and may by right require it as his reward
his reason briefly is this eternall life is promised upon condition of good workes therefore good workes are meritorious of eternall life

deny the consequence though eternall life bee promised upon condition of good workes yet good workes are not the meritorious cause thereof
first the reasons of my deniall are these first because eternall life before we had a being was freely intended to all of us that shall be saved not according to our workes but according to gods owne purpose and grace which was given us in christ iesus before all secular times tim


secondly because christ hath merited it for all the elect and there is no other meritorious cause of salvation besides him
thirdly because in christ it is freely promised to all the faithfull as their inheritance purchased by christ and therefore not to bee obtayned by their owne merit
fourthly as it was a reward freely promised so it is freely given as undefined span alphabet as the free gift of god
fifthly because as it selfe is the free gift of god so the graces and good workes to which it is promised as a reward are the free gifts of god of which the more we have the more are we indebted to god so sarre are wee from meriting any thing at the hands of god by them
sixthly because all our workes are debita debts or dutyes which we owe unto god and therefore when we have done all wee must say we are unprofitable servants
seventhly because there can bee no merit of condignity where is not an equall proportion betweene the worke and the reward
eighthly because our best workes are stained with the flesh

ninthly because god is our absolute lord and wee are his bondservants

to whom we owe our selves and whatsoever wee can doe neither are we able to render unto him so much as is due and much lesse can we merit any thing from him

tenthly because god to all his creatures giveth all

good things but receiveth

nothing from any and therefore cannot be made a debtour to any of his creatures

therefore though eternall life bee promised to good workes yet it is not merited by them
yea but saith bellarmine the promise made with a condition of workes doth make the thing promised due
answ
first where the condition is fully performed there the thing promised is due
but wee all faile in the fulfilling
and therefore if reward bee given to such as come short of their duety as all doe it must be acknowledged to bee of gods grace and not of our merit
secondly the thing promised is due not by merit but by promise not in espect of the worke done which is a dutie and that not so perfectly performed but that it needeth pardon but onely in respect of the promise because hee who hath promised hath bound himselfe to keepe his promise
but gods promise was gratuit non de debito say his promise was freely to give eternall life and so according to his promise he freely bestoweth it
yea but saith he by performing the condition not onely the thing promised becommeth due but he also that hath performed may truely be said to have merited the reward promised
but this say should have beene proved and not taken for granted being denyed by us and disproved by all the tenne arguments even now produced


xxii
his sixth argument is taken from those places wherein

mention is made of dignity or worthinesse
for as before hee had said in his second chapter to be worthy of reward and to merit it is all one according to that saying of our saviour luk

the labourer is worthy of his hire
the places are these wisd

god proved them and found them worthy of himselfe thes

that you may be counted worthie of gods kingdome for which allso ye suffer luk

they that shall be accounted worthy of that world and the resurrection from the dead
apoc

they shall walke with me in whites because they are worthy
his reason may thus bee framed whosoever are worthy of eternall life they doe merit or deserve it

those that doe good workes are worthy of eternall life therefore they doe merit or deserve it

answere by distinction
for there is difference betweene these two to be worthy and to be counted worthy undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet to be worthy by a mans owne worth or merit or by acceptation and grace or favour vouchsafed by another to be esteemed worthy to be worthy in our selves or to be accepted as worthy in christ
if the word be understood in the former sense deny the assumption if in the latter deny the proposition
for to be worthy or rather

to bee accounted worthy of eternall life by mercie and grace not dignitate sua sed dignatione divina not in themselves but in christ which is the case of all the faithfull and yet to merit and to deserve it by a mans owne worth implyeth a contradiction

against the assumption say that none of the faithfull though fruitfull of good workes is in himselfe or by his owne worth or merit worthy of eternall life
this hath beene the confession of the faithfull in all ages as partly noted before
iacob confesseth gen

that hee was lesse than the least of gods mercies that is unworthy of them though but temporall what would he have said of eternall david professeth himselfe unworthy of those temporall honours which god had vouchsafed unto him sam


chron


iohn the baptist confesseth that hee was not worthy to carry christs shoes mat

or to loose the latchet of them luk

iohn

the centurion whose faith is so highly commended professeth himselfe not to bee worthy that christ should come under his roofe mat

the afflictions of this life though one man did beare them all are not worthy of the future glory roman


adde to these the confessions of the fathers though cited many of them before

ambrose quid pssumus dignum pramiis facere coelestibus

herome nullum opus dignum dei justitia reperietur
againe

rever a nihil posset condignum pati glria coelesti etianisi talis esset illa qualis modò est vita

no man sheweth forth such a conversation as to be worthy of the kingdome of heaven
no

though a man should die ten thousand deaths and should performe all virtuous actions

the author of the worke not finished upon

matthew what doe we in this world worthy that wee may deserve to bee made partakers of our lord in the heavenly kingdome therefore the apostle rightly saith reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy of the future glory

augustine debita redditur poen damnato indebita gratia liberato nec ille se indignum queratur nec ignum se iste glorietur

in psal



salvum me fac non in mea justitia nn in meis meritis sed in tua misericrdia non quia ego sum dignus sed quia tu misericors es
so in psal

and


quicquid

promisit indignis promisit ut non quasi operibus merces prmitteretur sed gratia nomine suo gratis daretur

eusebius

emissenus professeth that wee can neither suffer nor doe any thing worthy of the heavenly good things

gregorie

the great illi beata vita in qu deo deo vivitur nllus ptest aequari lbor nulla opera comparari presertim cùm apostolus dicat non sunt condign passines

anatasius

sinaita this is true humility to practise good things and to esteeme himselfe uncleane undefined span alphabet and unworthy of god thinking to bee saved by his goodnesse alone

oecumenius he sheweth that we are not able either to suffer or to conferre any thing worthy of that remuneration which shall bee there

anselme professeth that a thousand yeeres devout service of god doth not condignely merit the being in the kingdome of heaven halfe a day

bernard fateor non sum dignus ego nec propriis possum meritis regnum obtinere coelorum and elsewhere

nihil sumus in cordibus nostris fortè in corde dei potest aliud latere de nobis
lege homo in corde tuo lege intra teipsum de teipso testimonia veritatis etiam hac communi luce judicabis te indignum

againe

nos sumus sponsa dei sed in corde dei
nos sumus sed ipsius dignatione non dignitate etsi ns puerili animositate gratis servari nolumus meritò non salvamur excludit miseriae dissimulatio miserationem nec dignatio locum habet ubi fuerit praesumptio dignitatis

the faithfull indeed are digni worthy as it is said apoc

sap

but it is dignatione divina non dignitate sua worthy not in themselves but in gods acceptation in christ even as they are just not in themselves but in christ cor

augustine

propter nomen tuum gratis propter nomen tuum non propter meritum meum quiatu dignatus es facere non quia ego dignus cui facias
and this is signified in the places alleaged luk

thess


which speake not of being worthy but of being accompted worthy in gods acceptation

to the proposition answere that they who are worthy not in themselves but in christ not in respect of their owne dignity but of gods dignation which is the case of all the faithfull though they be accompted worthy of eternall life yet they doe not merit it themselves but the merit of christ is imputed unto them which excludeth our merit
to that of luk

and likewise tim


the workman is worthy of his hire hath place among men who can deserve and earne their wages one of another so that the one bee not the of the other but gods workemen of whom those places speake though they deserv heir hire of them among whom they labour yet cannot being not their owne men but the bondservants of god deserve any thing at his hands
againe even among men the labourer is not worthy of his hire who hath but begun and not perfected his worke but our obedience our righteousnesse our charity whereby we serve god is but inchata non perfecta justitia

xxiii
his seventh argument is taken from those places

where it is said that god is a righteous judge and no accepter of persons as rom

gal


pet


act


but acception of persons is a vice contrary to distributive justice viz when a judge giveth reward without merits or a greater reward to lesse merits or a lesse reward to greater merits
god therefore in the retribution of rewards considereth the merits of men and according to the diversity of merits he assigneth the mansions of eternall life
this argument if it shall conclude the question must thus bee framed if god doe render to men the rewards of

eternall life neither without their merits nor greater rewards to lesse nor lesse to greater merits than god in the retribution of rewards considereth the merits of men and consequently the good workes of the faithfull are meritorious of eternall life but the antecedent is true therefore the consequent
the assumption hee proveth because the contrary is repugnant to distributive justice
thus therefore he proveth it
if god doe render rewards to men without their merits or greater rewards to lesse merits or lesse rewards to greater merits then is he an unjust judge and an accepter of persons which god forbid

but god is a righteous judge and no accepter of persons as is proved by the testimonies alleaged therfore he doth not render to men rewards without their merits neither doth he give greater rewards to lesse nor lesse rewards to greater merits
answ
deny the assumption of the former syllogisme and the proposition of the second
the assumption was that god doth not render to men rewards of eternall life without their merits
for that god doth give the reward of eternall life to some at the least without their merits it is evident in the elect infants who having no merits of their owne are saved only by the merits of christ
and the like is to be said of all other beleevers for whom our saviour by his merits hath purchased everlasting life
therefore that assumption is so farre from being true that the contrary thereof is alwaies true viz that god doth give the reward of eternall life as his free gift to all that are saved without any merit of theirs
neither is there any other merit of eternall life but the merit of christ which is more than sufficient for all that beleeve

the proposition of the prosyllogisme hath two branches in both the parts thereof of both which deny the consequence for as touching the first although god doe render to men the reward of eternall life without their merits yet hee is not an unjust iudge
for though they have no merit of their owne yet they have the satisfaction and the infinite merit of christ unto which eternall life is in justice due
for the second although the lord should give greater rewards to lesse offices and graces and lesse to greater yet were hee not unjust nor an accepter of persons
for by the parable of the workmen mat
wee learne that the master of the vineyard though he gave the to them that wrought but one houre which was as much as he gave them that wrought twelve houres yet was not unjust therin
for in that which is free and meerely of grace there is no injustice nor acception of persons
indeed where the wages or hire is to bee rendred undefined span alphabet as deserved and earned by the workemens labours it is to bee distributed according to distributive justice
but where the reward is free and of grace the rewarder may doe with his owne what

pleaseth him god especially to whom in all things whatsoever hee doth his will is the rule of justice

xxiv
to these hereticall premisses bellarmine addeth a sutable

corollary wherein there is more malice than might
therefore saith hee augustine saith well if there bee no merits how shall god judge this world wherefore the heresie of our adversaries which taketh away merits doth also take away the article of faith concerning the future judgemnt
answ
augustine by merits understandeth workes which are to bee rewarded both the good workes of the godly proceeding from grace sanctifying and helping the will which he though unproperly calleth their merits and also the evill workes of the wicked proceeding from their free will not freeed by grace which also hee calleth and that properly their merits
for whereas there were two sorts of men living in the monastery of

adrumetium whereof valentinus was to whom hee writeth who ran into contrary extremes the one so holding that they denied grace the other so holding grace that they denied and which was worse said that at the day of judgement god is not to render to every man according to his works augustine writeth against both
si non est dei gratia quomodo salvat mundum et si non est liberum arbitrium quomodo judicat mundum
if gods grace bee not how doth he save the world and if there bee no how doth hee judge the world and afterwards in the place which bellarmine citeth having denyed against the pelagians that grace is given according to merits hee addeth these words non qui nullum est meritum vel bonum piorum vel malum impiorum aliquin quomodo judicabit deus mundum not because there is no merit either good of the godly or bad of the wicked otherwise how shall god judge the world that is if there bee no workes to bee rewarded neither good with blisse nor bad with punishment how shall god judge the world but wee acknowledge that god will render to every man according to his workes rewarding the good workes of the godly which are unproperly called merits both themselves and their reward being the free gifts of god with eternall life and the evill workes of the wicked which properly are called their merits with everlasting death
so farre are wee through gods grace from denying that article of the future judgement whereof the pope and the papists seme to make but a mockery hee granting and they accepting or defending his grant of indulgences and pardons for many thousands of yeeres whereby is presupposed that the day of judgement may perhaps bee so long differred
for at the day of judgement when all shall bee adjudged to eternall either life or death purgatory shall bee at an end as themselves teach and together with purgatory the use of pardons endeth

cap vi
the testimonies of the fathers alleaged by bellarmine

answered




now come to his allegation of the fathers
but

before examine the particular testimonies am to admonish the reader that hee have an eye to the point in question
for that the latine fathers doe often use the termes of merit or meriting we doe acknowledge but without any advantage to the papist
for the papist useth the words in the proper sense for deserving and desert
but merits with the fathers signifie no more but good workes or at the most good works which god will reward that is either simply good workes or with relation to reward
and the verbe merit besides the generall sense of obtaining or finding favour which is very frequent they use it more particularly for doing workes of grace which god will graciously reward
in which senses the use of the words though unproper were not to bee misliked in the fathers were it not that the have taken occasion thereby to use the words properly for deservnig and desert and that in justice for the workes sake as well in good workes as in bad
meane that good workes doe as truely and as properly deserve eternall life as evill workes deserve everlasting death which was not the meaning of the fathers who meant not that a man doth deserve those good things at the hands of god which by them hee is said to have merited
if therefore his allegation bee of merits and meriting used by the fathers in the former that is the unproper senses as indeed they are hee shall proove nothing but that the fathers doe not dissent from us
and if they serve not to prove either that the works of grace in themselves doe merit that is deserve eternall life as the meritorious causes thereof or that christ hath by his merits made them meritorious then doe they not at all make fo the papists against us
but am confident that they are not able to produce any one pregnant testimony of the ancient fathers affirming either that our good workes doe truely and properly that is condignely merit eternall life or that christ hath merited for our workes that they might bee meritorious of everlasting life

ii
hee beginneth with the greeke fathers of whom hee citeth

eight
the first is ignatius sinite me ut bestiarum esca sim per

quam possim deum promereri
here bellarmine for a poore shift is faine to make use of a corrupt latine translation as it were a puddle leaving the fountaine and the purer streames
the originall is undefined span alphabet suffer me that may become the food of wild beasts by whom may obtaine god
and so their owne vairlemius translateth sine me ferarum escam fieri per quas licebit deum adipisci
but the same latine

translatour doating as it seemeth upon his helena of merit more than once or twice in that epistle useth the word merear that may merit where the greeke is undefined span alphabet that may finde enjoy obtaine and in the first sentence of the epistle twice deprecans deum obtinui ut videre merear dignos vultus vestros sicut plurimum optabam promereri
the greeke is undefined span alphabet which vairlemius rendreth thus deprecatus deum obtinui ut viderem divinas vestras facies quas plurimum expetebam
and in the third sentence for undefined span alphabet si modo graiam consequar the latine translatour whom bellarmine followeth readeth si quidem per graiam meruero
and in the next sentence for undefined span alphabet dem asseqi hee readeth deum promereri
and in the next where ignatius saith shall not have the like opportunity undefined span alphabet deum assequendi of attaining to god he readeh ut deum promeruissem five times in the five first sentences
omit the rest
but how little ignatius favoured the proud and antichristian conceit of merits may appeare by that which followeth in the same epistle
now being bound in him lea ne to covet no woldly nor vaine thing
by sea and land even from syria to rome fight with beasts being night and day bound to ten leopards which is a guard of souldiers who by benefits become worse
but by their injuries am more instructed
notwithstanding

am not hereby justified

the second is iustin martyr homines qui dignos se dei voluntate

consilio operibus praestiterint cum eo victuros esse meritis suis sumpsimus ac regnatur os sicut ab oni interitu perturbationéque sint liberi
where bellarmine againe maketh use of a corrupt translation the greeke text is this undefined span alphabet
where having said that god hath created all things for men addeth who if by their workes shall shew themselves worthy his will or to his will wee have received or learned that they are vouchsafed or accounted worthy of conversation with him raigning together with him made incorruptible and impassible
here in stead of being vouchsafed or deemed worthy his that is gods conversation or fellowship viz in heaven where they shall raigne with him without corruption or passion hee absurdly readeth they shall live and raigne with him by their merits

the third is irenaeus let us thinke that crowne precious which is

gotten by conflict or contending for it and commeth not unto us of it owne accord that is wihout seeking
and by how much the more it commeth unto us by striving or contending for it by so much it is the more precious

not that contention or conflict is the meritorious cause of eternall life but the way to heaven luke

matth


act


and the meanes to victory to which god hath promised freely to give a crowne of life iam

apoc



bellarmines reference of his reader to the forty fourth chapter is but to make him lose his labour

the fourth is origen whom bellarmine falsifieth reading pro meritis

in stead of pro operibus
will recite the whole place
nunc requiramus de justo judicio dei in quo reddet unicuique secundum opera sua
et primo guidem excludantur haeretici qui dicunt animarum natur as bonas vel malas audiant non quia pro natura unicuique deus sed pro operibus suis pro meritis suis saith bellarmine reddit
secundo in loco aedificentur fideles nè putent sibi hoc solum sufficere posse quod credant sed sciant justum judicium dei reddere secundum opera
where if hee will needs read pro meritis in stad of the apostles words on which

origen writeth undefined span alphabet yet according to that latine translation he expoundeth the words twice secundum opera retaining the words of the apostle

the fifth is basil for as for clemens alexandrinus and such other testimonies

of the fathers as bellarmie doth but point at meane not to trouble my selfe with the search of them
for if they had said any thing for him to better purpose than those which hee doth cite presume hee would have recited their words being forced to such poore shifts even in those whom he doth cite

out of basil he citeth two testimonies the former

homo exjustitiae operibus salvatur which words as bellarmine citeth them directly contradict the doctrine of the holy ghost who saith that a man is not saved by the workes of righteousnesse tit

ephes


yea of basil himselfe in other places as in psal and in psal
before cited
but indeed the words are these undefined span alphabet
as though a man saved by his workes of righteousnesse were farre from bereaving the holy ghost of his due glory which censure let the papists who looke to bee saved by their workes apply to themselves
for if the words were as he citeth them they would further erasmus his censure

that this part of that booke is not basils

the other testimony is this

omnes qui viam evangelicam incedimus mercatores sumus per oper a mandatorum nobis possessionem coelestium comparantes
here also bellarmines reliefe is in the translation as shall appeare by recitall of the place
the kingdome of heaven saith he out of matth


is like a merchant man undefined span alphabet
all wee therefore who goe the way of the gospell are merchants· gaining to ourselves the possession of heavenly gifts or goods by the traffique or negotiation of the commandements
it behoveth us therefore to gather much and manifold heavenly riches where by heavenly things hee doth not meane the heavenly joyes or glory of heaven but heavenly gifts and graces in this life

which in the words following hee calleth heavenly wealth
neither doth hee speake of purchasing the reall possession of heaven by the workes of the commandements but of gaining spirituall and heavenly gifts undefined span alphabet by exercising the trade or by the gaine for that is the undefined span alphabet of merchants and trades men math


act


of gods commandements both legall and evangelicall which is a rich stoke for in the keeping of them there is great reward and by imploying the talents which god hath committed unto us that wee should undefined span alphabet trade with them matth


and by trading with them gaine unto our selves a treasure of heavenly riches
for as our saviour saith matth


habenti dabitur exuberabit habenti that is to him tha imployeth his gifts and tradeth with them it shall bee gven and he shall abound
for those that excercise the trade of gods commandements being rich in good workes they doe as the apostle saith

treasue up to themselves a good foundation that is assurance of eternall life for so he saith that they may lay hold on eternall life viz by the ssurance or plerophory of faith and hope
for by being rich in good workes men doe make their

calling and election sure and so are

saved in hope
but that we should purchase the reall possession of the heavenly kingdome by the workes of the law which christ alone hath purchased for us were little better than blasphemy from which saint basil is sree
and that this which have delivered was basils meaning appeareth by that which followeth
for after he had said that we must gather heavenly wealth he addeth if we would not be ashamed at the shewing undefined span alphabet of our negotiation as those

who had received the talents nor heare tou wicked and slothfull servant but having laid up our wares which before hee called heavenly riches to endeavour to passe through this life safely and securely
and this further appeareth by the whole discourse
for having said before the words alleaged that to our navigation in this life the gift of governing as it were of our shippe is necessary for we are all merchants for saith hee in the next words after those which alleaged last many who from their youth have gathered geat store namely of that heavenly wealth in the middle of their life for the want of the skill of governing and not able to withstand the tempests of temptations have made shipwracke which saith he is a miserable spectacle undefined span alphabet
that hee who hath prospered in the negotiation of the commandements should become like a merchant of great wealth who glorying in the multitude of his wares his ship also failing wih a prosperous winde and having passed the dreadfull seas at length suffering shipwracke at the very haven is at once deprived of all

the sixth is chrysostome if god be just hee will render both to the

godly and to the wicked according to theirmerits
but if he will render both to the one and the other according to their merits and in this life neither de receive neither the one the punishment of wickednesse nor the other the reward of vertue it is manifest that there remaineth another time in which they shall have either of them a convenien reward

here also the force of bellarmines argument is in the translation
for the words which twice hee translateth pro merits are undefined span alphabet according to their worthinesse which is of a larger extent than merit
now men are said to be worthy either of eternall punishment and that in and of themselves by their sinnes or of eternall life but not of or in themselves but in christ and by grace god accepting of them in christs worthinesse his merits being imputed to them without any merit of their owne
and thus god will repay the wicked for their demerits and reward the godly according to their worthinesse which standeth not in dignitate sua but in dignatione divina as have said before
howbeit his meaning in this place by undefined span alphabet is all one as suppose with undefined span alphabet that is according to the quality of their works that is to say rendring damnation to the wicked and salvation to the godly
for so in the words going before hee saith that the godly shall receive undefined span alphabet the rewards of their vertue and the wicked undefined span alphabet and in the allegation it selfe hee explaneth what hee meaneth by undefined span alphabet to wit that the wicked shall receive undefined span alphabet the punishment of their wickednesse and the godly undefined span alphabet the rewards of their vertue

the seventh is gregory nazianzen crede resurrectionem judicium

mercedem adjustum dei lancem exigendam
the words are undefined span alphabet
besides these articles of the christian faith receive the resurrection judgement remuneration by gods just balance
what is that balance but the righteous will of god which is the rule and standard of all justice which will render to every one according to their workes that is to say to the wicked everlasting death and to the godly eternall life
but merit of condignity was no point of his faith

the eighth is gregory nissen denique pro suis quemque meritis ornatum

cerno
gregory in that place deciphereth the judgment to come
and having described the iudge and them that are to bee judged heare saith he the speech as of the iudge and their answers then followeth undefined span alphabet which are the words which bellarmine citeth and import no more but this that hee distributed to every one fitting rewards which hee doth particularize in the words following to them that have led a godly life the fruition of the kingdome but to the inhumane and wicked the punishment of fire and that everlasting
and these were his greeke fathers whose learned judgements hee hath not alleaged but for the most part the popish conceits of their partiall translatours


iii
of the latines he citeth eleven fathers
to whose test imonies

if it bee remembred that they use not the word meriting for justly deserving but either for obtaining and finding favour to obtaine or for doing that which god will accept and reward or the word merits in the better sense properly for such workes as doe truely and condignely merit or deserve but onely for good workes either simply or with relation to a free reward that is for such good works as god will freely reward it will not be hard to answere
neither will the papists as suppose

bee ever able to alleage any one pregnant testimony where the word is used in the popish ense for that which truely properly and condignely deserveth a reward to bee rendred in justice for the workes sake
neither doe we deny merits in the sense of the fathers but confesse that the good workes of the faithfull are such as god accepteth reward them
and so vega defineth merit the name of merit saith hee

is restrained to those works which god accepteth to some reward
and so augustine useth the word as bellarmine confesseth

to signifie any good act for which wee receive any other thing

but let us briefly examin the particulars
and first the testimony of tertullian· which as hee alleageth it is to mee a riddle

oro meriorum dispositorum nomine disponetur merita autem cum corpori quo{que adsribantur ordo quoque corporm disponatur necesse est ut possit esse meritorum which cannot assoile though should read with pamelius ordo enim non alud quam meritorum dispositor unlesse wee understand the word merits not actively for good workes meriting or obtaining but passively for the rewards obtained
for actively merits cannot be attributed to the body· which cannot produce any act of freewill and therefore cannot according to the doctrine of the papists merit
but the rewards are attributed as well to the body as to the soule and from thence hee proveth the resurrection of the body out of cor


the second is cyprtan out of whom hee citeth two testimonies
the

former

justtia opus est· ut promereri quis possit deum that a man may obtaine gods favour there is need of justice wee must obey his precepts and monitions ut accipiant meita nostra mercedem that our good workes may receive the reward which god hath promised
the other testimony

is the last sentence of his booke de opere eleemosynis containing an effectuall exhortation to the workes of charity from the reward that god hath promised and will graciously bestow on those that are forward in these workes
nusquam dominus meritis ad premium deerit god will no where bee wanting to our good workes to reward them
to them that overcome in peace he will give a white crowne for their actions and to them that overcome in persecution hee will redouble a purple crowne for their suffering
where hee saith no more being rightly understood than te preachers of the gospell use to say upon the like occasion

his allegation ou of hlarie regnum dei vitae nostrae stipendiis quaramus

is a grosse making of stipends for merits which are contraries
for merits in his owe conceit are mens workes stipends are the rewards which god gveth to our workes
and this absurdity is increased by our

ieuites translation set forth in capitall letters
let us saith he endevour to puchase the kingdom of heaven by the price of our good life so that in his learning quaerere is to endevour to purchase and stipenia vitae nostrae is the price or merit of our good life
the words are spoken by way of exposition upon matth


where our saviour having disswaded us from seeking inordinately the things of this life directeth us what wee are first to seeke

but first seeke the kingdome

of god and his righteousnesse and all these things shall bee added unto you all these things that is stipendia vitae nostrae the stipends of this life of ours which god hath promised to give to them that seeke his kingdom and his righteousnesse as the petty rewards of our piety
for those things that hee calleth stipends must either bee stipends by us given to god or by us received from him
but the former is absurd if not blasphemous therefore by the stipends of this life wee are to understand undefined span alphabet the things of this life as food and apparell which god undefined span alphabet as it were by way of advantage or surplusage addeth to these to whom hee giveth his kingdome and righteousnesse which they first sought for so hee saith undefined span alphabet
but if the kingdome of god which with these things

is to bee sought were by them to bee purchased then the righteousnesse of god by which wee are justified and entitued to that kingdome that is the righteousnesse of god

and our saviour iesus christ should also bee purchased by gods temporall gifts for so hee saith seeke the kingdome of god and his righteousnesse and therfore it rather than they should be called stipendium or merces which the papists themselves deny it being gratia onely a they confesse and not mrces

as for those other words

which bellarmine citeth de nostro igitur est beata illa aeternitas promerenda
presume that hee himselfe would not subscribe unto them as they sound as if wee attained to heaven by any thing that is properly ours and from our selves
but hiari's meaning may bee gathered from that which went before
for writing upon matth


many shall say to mee in that day lord lord have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils saith that christ condemneth the hypocrisie of counterfeit preachers who though they were vod of sanctifying grace yet because they prophesied and wrought wonders in his name did therefore promise to themselves the kingdome of heaven quasi verò eorum aliquid proprium sit quae loqntur aut faciun as if any of those things which they say or doe were their owne they beng but the instruments of god by whom hee speaketh and worketh for the good of others and therefore both the word and the worke is not theis but gods
but if wee desie to attaine to that blessed eternity prstandum aliquid est ex proprio at bonum velimus malum omne vitemus totoque affectu praeceptis caelestius obtemperemus wee must doe something of our owne that wee will that which is good and shun all evill and with all our affection obey the heavenly precepts which though they be not from our selves yet may be called ours as being our workes and properly tending to our owne good

to the testimony of ambrose nonne evidens est meritorum aut praemia

spplicia post mortem manere wee readily subscribe understanding by merits according to the language of the latine fathers workes with relation to reward whether good or bad

to the testimony of ierome denarius quas indalgentia veri principis

mnes per baptismum omittit de carere
am nostri laboris est pro dversitate virtutum diversa nobis praemi praeparare answere that hee diputing

against iovinan who held equality of rewards in the life to come using for his argument one and the same which was given to unequall labours answereth that unus denarius no est unum prmium one peny is not one and the same reward sed un vita ac una de gehenna libe ratio but one life and one deliverance out of hell
but as at the granting of a princes pardon men that are guilty of divers crimes are all released out of prison and every one according to his labour or his workes is in this or that state of life even so the penny as it were the pardon of the true prince by baptisme releaseth all out of prison
now it must bee our lbour according to the diversity of virtues to prepare unto our selves divers rewards
his meaning is that in the life to come which as it is eternall is one and the same to all there are divers degrees of glory
whereas therefore wee have deliverance from hell and title to heaven by the true princes pardon it being purchased for all true beleevers by the merit of christ which in baptisme is equally applyed to all the faithfull it must therefore bee our endevour by labouring for a greater measure of grace to prepare as it were for our selves a greater measure of glory
for the lord doth crowne his own graces in us with glory and the greater graces with greater glory
and although both the life it selfe and the degrees of glory therin as to sit some on christs right hand and some on his left in his kingdome are prepared by god as it is said matth


and by our saviour who therefore ascended into his fathers house wherein are many mansions that hee might prepare or provide a place for each of us ioh

yet we may be said after a sort to prepare for our selves greater rewards when wee labour to be endued with greater graces

to the testimony of paulinus tuarum tibi praemia se debere virttum justus jdex agnoscet onely answere this because have not the booke that although it bee a harsh speech that god should bee said to bee a debtour to any crature yet as augustine saith hee may bee said to be a debtour as hee is a promiser and because it is a just thing to keepe promise hee may be said to owe the performance of that which hee hath promised

but as his promise was not de debito but de gratuit so what hee freely promised he freely giveth


out of augustine he citeth three testimonies two out of his epistle

to sixtus out of which epistle have before produced divers pregnant testimonies against merits so properlycalled
his first allegation is this nullane sunt merita justorm sunt planè quia usti sunt sed ut justi fierent merita non fuerunt
in which testimony there is nothing for the merit of condignity but onely the name of merit which notwithstanding ignifieth nothing but the good workes of the just which god will reward
as if hee had said have the just no good workes which god will reward they have no doubt because they are just
for as saint iohn saith he tht worketh righteousnesse is righteous ih

but as the former words doe not prove the merit of condignity so the later words plainely disprove merits of congruity that they might become righteous saith hee they had no merits for as in the same epistle

augustine teacheth against bothsorts of merits
sicut ab initio fidei misericordiam consequuti sumus non quia fideles eramus sed ut essemus sic in fine quod eit in vita aeterna coronabit nos sicut scriptum est in miseratione misericrdia

secondly as touching the other

augustine indeed saith that as the apostle calleth death the stipend of sinne so he might truly have called eternall life the stipend of righteousnesse
but yet hee could not say that it was debitum stipendium
because the apostle by way of opposition saith that death is the stipend meaning the due and deserved stipend of sinne but eternall life is the free gift of god
nay he saith the contrary

that it is not to be demanded tanquam debitum stipendium
and

elsewhere as we heard before though the apostle might have said that eternall life is the stipend of righteousnesse yet he would rather say that it is the grace of god that hereby we might understand that god doth not bring us to eternall life by our merits but by his mercie
and in the same hundred and fifth

epistle
the stipend of sinne is death and worthily it is called a stipend because it is due deinde ne justitia de humano se extolleret bono sicut humanum meritum malum non dubitatur esse peccatum non contrario retulit dicens stipendium justiti vita aeterna sed gratia inquit dei vita diceret audito quòd stipendium peccati est mors quid te disponis extollere contrariam mrti vitam aeternam tanquam debitum stipendium flagitare but of this point have spoken more than sufficiently when urged

our fourth testimony out of rom


but the third testimony

bellarmine chiefly urgeth vita aeterna est ttum praemium cujus promissione gaudemus
eternall life is the whole reward in the promise whereof we doe rejoyce nor can this reward come before merits be had neither may it be given to a man before he be worthy
for what more unjust than this and what more just than god we must not therefore demand the reward before wee merit to receive it

answ
augustine as himselfe

testifieth wrote this booke when he was newly baptised and as yet not accustomed or well versed in the scriptures and therefore if he should have written any thing therein contrary to that which have heretofore proved out of him it ought not to prejudge those manifold pregnant testimonies by mee cited before which he wrought when he was of more mature judgement and of riper yeares
notwithstanding out of this testimony such as it is bellarmin collecteth five conclusions against us
first that a man he meaneth doubt a righteous man hath the merits of eternall life that is as bellarmine acknowledgeth augustine to use the terme that he hath good workes which god will reward with eternall life and that we confesse

secondly that eternall life is one and all our reward
but augustine doth not say unm neither is it true
for temporall blessings are also rewards

though but petty rewards in comparison of eternall life neither doth he say simply totum but ttum cujus promissione gaudemus

for temporall benefits we are to use but not to set our hearts upon them but spirituall blessings are those wherein

we are to rejoyce them we use these we are to enjoy for those are utenda but these are sruenda

thirdly that the reward of eternall life is given in justice that we should not say that it is given of meere liberality
but augustine every where else teacheth that it is given of grace and that it is called grace non ob aliud nisi quia gratis datur for no other cause but because it is frely given and that it is not grace si non sit omni modo gratuita
neither doth it hinder it to be of gods free grace that it is given in justice
for these two in the workes of god especially in the worke of justification and salvation doe meet together
grace and mercie in respect of us in that he doth justifie and save us gratis by

his grace justice not in respect of our merits which in justice can merit nothing at the hands of god but punishment but partly in repect of christs merits unto which eternall life is due and partly in respect of his promise made in christ to all that truely beleeve which promise he is faithfull and just to performe

fourthly that the reward is not given before they be found worthy of it that shall have it lest wee should fay there is no dignity in workes
answere that our dignity standeth in gods dignation or acceptation in christ which dignity he vouchsafeth to all that truely beleeve in christ
for to them christ

is the end and complement of the law insomuch that whosoever beleeve in christ they are esteemed to have fulfilled the law wee acknowledge the dignitie of good workes as being the fruits of the spirit and as being good profitable and necessary but no dignity of merit doe we ascribe to them
and yet the faithfull are not therefore unworthy nor destitute of merits so long as they are accepted in christ and made partakers of his merits by faith unto which faith augustine useth to ascribe merit
for indeed faith is that worke of

god which hee requireth instead of all our merits because by it wee are partakers of the merits of christ which whosoever hath is not without merits nor unworthy of the kingdome of heaven

fifthly that it is a most unjust thing to desire eternall life of god the most just judge before we merit to receive it
where faith he he plainely condemneth all lutherans who will not by their workes merit eternall life and yet by assurance of faith they presume it shall be given them
answ
if by his word petere he meane desiring by prayer say we must desire it before we be worthy of it in our selves
but augustine hath the word poscere meaning that no man ought to challeng or demand eternal life as his due before he hath deserved to receive it to which answere that none can deserve to receive it by their owe merits and that none but pharisees will challenge it
but yet all that truely beleeve in christ doe in him deserve it yea in him they have it and he that will not beleeve this he maketh god a lyar ioh

and therefore every one that knoweth himselfe

to beleeve doth or ought to know that he hath eternall life iohn

he might have added a sixt collection that nothing is more unjust than that god should give rewards to men before they deserve them
but this sheweth the unsoundnesse of this testimony not beseeming augustine
for what god giveth he freely giveth and in that which is gratitum free there is no unjustice
may not god doe with his owne

what pleafeth him and therfore no unjustice when he gave the whole dayes wages to them that had wrought but an houre and therefore to such as had not deserved it
and if it be unjust with god to give the reward of eternall life to them that have not in their owne persons deserved it what will he say of gods dealing with the elect infants who dying in their infancie are crowned with eternall life
this testimonie therefore was but the assertion of an ungrounded divine
and yet this testimonie alone with our

braggadochio is sufficient to put us all to silence

eighthly his allegation of prosper justificatus homo id est ex impio

pius factus nullo praecedente bono merito accipit donum quo medio acquir at meritum maketh wholly against the merit of congruity which with the pelagians the papists doe hold but against us it hath nothing except perhaps the word merit which is not against us in that sense that he and augustine use it for a rewardable worke which before justification men have not but with their justification they receive grace from which what good workes doe proceed are to bee rewarded with eternall life

ninthly the word merit being understood in that sense as undoubtedly

it is in all the latine fathers we subscribe to the testimonie of caelestinus bishop of rome as making for us rather than against us
for having said dei gratiâ omnia hominis merita praeveniri that all the good workes of men are prevented by gods grace hee addeth tant a est enim erga omnes homines bonitas dei ut nostra velit esse merita quae sunt ipsius dono pro his quae largitus est aeterna premia sit donaturus which notably setteth forth the unspeakable goodnesse of god to us but not our desert towards him

tenthly the like is to be said of his allegation out of gregory on

those words of iob

parvus magnus ibi sunt quia in hac vita nobis est discretio operum rit in illa proculdubio discretio dignitatum ut quo hic alius alium merito superat illic aius alium retributione transcenat where he using promiscuously the words opera and merita by merita understandeth opera bona proceeding from grace which hee acknowledged to bee the free gifts of god
wherefore his meaning is no more but this that on those to whom in this life god doth give greater grace he bestoweth in the life to come greater glory

eleventhly in the last place hee alleageth bernard who in the

whole controversie of justification and in this question of merits is wholly ours
out of him he citeth two testimonies
the former merita habere cures habita data noveris perniciosa paupertas penria meritorum
answ
bernard useth ordinarily the word merit unproperly

according to the use of the latine fathers meaning thereby good workes and that either simply or with relation to reward that is to say rewardable workes such workes or merits saith bernard we must be carefull to have and having them we must acknowledge them to bee gods gifts the penur of them is

pernicious poverty
the other

omne quod feceris bonum malúmve quod quidem non facere liberum sit meritò ad meritum deputatur
answ
that is worthily accounted merit that is a rewardable worke which is free for a man not to doe
for what is not voluntary but forced it deserveth not reward
but to speake of merits properly as justly and condignely deserving a due and proportionable reward for the workes sake bernard acknowledgeth no merits but the mercies of god and the merits of christ denying our workes to be our merits but gods gifts nor to be merits properly or meritorious causes of our salvation as have shewed

before

and these were all the testimonies of the fathers which bellarmine thought good to produce which when the reader hath compared with those which formerly alleaged let him pronounce secundum allegata probata whether wee or the papists have the consent of antiquitie in this great question of merits

iv
but to the testimonies of the fathers bellarmine adjoyneth the authority of foure councels
the first whereof is the second councell held at aurenge

in france
debetur merces bonis operibus si fiant sed gratia qui non debetur praecedit fiant
reward is due to good workes when they bee wrought but grace which is not due goeth before that they may be wrought which canon as all the rest is collected out of the writings of augustine for the confutation of the and is to bee understood according to the constant and perpetuall doctrine of

augustine that reward is due to good workes not in respect of the dignity or worth of workes but in regard of gods promise
now there is great difference betweene that

which is due by desert and that which is due by promise
for where a great reward is promised to a small worke the reward is due by promise but not by desert
but much more when eternall life is promised to our workes betwixt which there is no proportion
therefore though eternall life bee a reward due in regard of promise yet it is a free and undeserved reward and is therefore called undefined span alphabet the free gift of god or as augustine useth to render it according to the vulgar latine gratia and that in opposition to the wages or deserved reward of sinne rom

and is so called gratia non aliud nisi quia gratis datur as have shewed before

as for the other three popish councels viz lateranense florentinum tridentinum they are not to bee accepted as witnesses but to be excepted against as parties

wee have heard bellarmines testimonies both of scriptures

and fathers now wee should heare his reason but that wee have heard and confuted it before
in the last place saith hee there may bee

added one evident reason from those things which were prooved in the former booke
for it hath beene demonstrated that the good workes of the just are truely just that they satisfie the law of god that they justifie a man whereupon it followeth that they are truely meritorious
whereunto retrne this answere
first to the antecedent that it hath beene sufficiently demonstrated that the worke of just or justified men though they may bee said to bee truely good yet they are not purly good that they doe not satisfie the law of god that they doe not justifie a man before god so farre are they from being truely meritorious
secondly to the consequence that although they were truely good although by them men did satisfie the law of god by doing all that is commanded yet so long as men do but their duety they must confesse themselves to bee but unprofitable servants neither doe they merit any thing at the hands of god
for debitum non est meritum that which is debt is not merit
and if they could which they cannot by their obedience satisfie the commandement for the time to come yet how shall they satisfie the penalty for their sinnes past wherefore a servant is well apaied as theophylact said if he escape the whippe though hee cannot deserve so much as thankes which is but a verball reward
but hee prooveth the consequence because the chiefe reason why wee poore heretikes deny merits is because wee thike that no worke in this life is truely just or doth satisfie the law but that all our workes are mortall sinnes in their owne nature answ
though wee were heretickes which hee with all his complices shall never bee able to prove yet would it not become him to belie us
for neither doe wee denie the good workes of the faithfull to bee truely just neither doe wee say that they are sinnes and much lesse mortall sinnes neither is that the chiefe reason why wee deny them to bee meritorious as you may perceive by the reasons before alleaged neither if that reason doe as it doth prove them not to bee meritorious doth it follow that therefore the contrary doth prove them to bee meritorious at the hands of god
for though they were not onely truely but also purely good though they were not sinfull nor stayned with the flesh as all are yet so long as they are our duties so long as they are gods free gifts so long as there is no proportion betweene them and the reward so long as they are accompanied with manifold sinnes and infirmities and so long as all the reasons before alleaged against merits stand in force it followeth necessarily that we neither doe or can by all the workes wee can performe merit any good thing and much lesse the eternall reward at the hands of god

chap
vii
other questions concerning merits discussed as of trust in merits and of an eye to the reward



and yet here is not an end for still ac ording to his methode such as it is hee hath certaine qustions to discusse
in mine opinion hee being to dispute of merits if hee had meant to deale plainely and sincerely should first have shewed what merit is and what is required to a meritorious worke
secondly what sorts of merits there are and what thereby is merited
thirdly whether the good workes of the faithfull bee meritorious or not and if they be how farre forth and then in the last place the two questions might have beene propounded undefined span alphabet that seeing as hee teacheth good workes doe merit reward whether it bee lawfull to doe a good worke having an eye to the reward
secondly whether men may trust in their merits
but he first disputeth against us that the good workes of the faithfull bee truely meritorious of eternall life which hitherto hee hath endevoured to

prove in his first sixt chapters
in the second place hee disputeth the to accessary questions the one whether and how farre forth men may trust in their merits cap

the other whether it bee lawfull in doing good workes to have an eye to the eternall reward cap

then hee commeth to shew against some learned men of their owne side among whom there is great dissention in this question of merit
first what is required to make a worke meritorious and sheweth that to a merit seven conditions are required cap

secondly how farre forth good workes are either meritorious or rewarded
meritorious whether ex condign cap

and if so whether in respect of the promise onely or also in regard of the worke it selfe cap

and as touching the reward whether god doth reward good workes supra condignum cap

in the last place what those things are that are merited ex condigno viz eternall life

and the increase of justice but not the grace of justification cap

nor reparation after a fall nor perseverance to the end which three are merited ex congruo as he saith cap


ii
his discourse

concerning trust and affiance whether it be to bee reposed in merits and how farre forth serveth to no other purpose but to answere one of our arguments and therefore handled

this question so farre as was needfull in our eleventh argument
neither shall it now bee needfull to insist thereupon first because having as hope sufficiently prooved that wee have no merits it is needlesse to prove that wee are not to trust in them
secondly because bellarmine confesseth that by reason of the uncertainety of or owne righteousnesse and danger of for how can a man trust in his owne merits when he knoweth not whether hee hath any or not which is the condition of

all papists or how is it possible that a man who is guilty to himselfe of sinne should without pharisaicall pride trust to bee saved in his owne merits and therefore to say it is lawfull to trust in our merits modo superbi caveatur is as if should say it is lawfull to worship idols with divine worship modò idlolatria caveatur it is

most safe to repose our whole affiance in the mercie and bounty of god whereunto hee might have added the merits of christ by trusting in which wee are taught also to rerepose affiance not onely in the mercie but also in the justice of god
and if our whole affiance be to be reposed in gods goodnesse then no part thereof is to bee placed in our owne merits or if our affiance bee to bee reposed in our merits at all then it is not most safe to place our whole affiance in gods mercie
and if it bee most safe to repose our whole affiance in the goodnesse of god then are they unwise who place it in their owne goodnesse
but besides the danger of pride which cannot bee avoided and of being perniciously deceived if wee trust to our owne merits as to a broken staffe wee should also commit horrible impiety in making idols of our owne merits or rather of our selves
for in what wee repose our trust for salvation that wee make our god
so should wee sbject our selves to the curse of god who saith

cursed bee the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arme and whose heart departeth from the lord


iii
his other discourse de intuitu mercedis in the overt intention

or pretence which hee expresseth is a meere calumniation in the covert intent which hee dareth not pretend it is a meere aberration from the truth
the overt intention is to calumniate calvin and all true catholicks as if wee held it unlawfull when wee doe any good workes to have in the doing of them an eye to the eternall reward when it is evident by the very places which hee alleageth out of

calvin that he taught nothing in this point but that which bellarmine affirmeth to bee the doctrine of the councill of trent and which himselfe acknowledgeth to be true to wit that it is lawfull in doing good to have an eie to the reward but that this ought not bee our chiefe respect
for our chiefe respect ought to bee the glory of god which wee must seeke by a godly life to advance though there were neither heaven nor hell but the desire of the eternall reward is but a secondary respect which is subordinate to gods glory and to bee desired for it
bellarmine saith

well cupimus deum videre atque ex ea visione felices effici ut tanto ardentius securius deum diligamus
the glory of god we are to seeke though our

profit were not subordinated unto it and therefore though wee were not to have an eye to the reward
non sine praemio diligitur deus saith bernard etsi absque praemii intuitu diligendus sit
for those that doe good

onely or chiefely for the eward are led like hirelings by a mercenary respect without which they would not serve him which becommeth not the sonnes of god neither doth their obedience or service proceed from the love of god or their neighbours but from neither is eternall life to bee expected as the stipend of servants but as the inheritance of sonnes undefined span alphabet saith

marcs eremita he that doth good and seeketh remuneration only or chiefely he serveth not god but his own will neither doth he love or serve god propter ipsum sed propter se not for gods sake but for his owne


iv
but that in a secondary respect after the glory of god wee

may and ought to have an eye to the eternall reward it is confessed or rather prosessed by us
and it is evidently proved first by gods promises rewards and blessings and by his threatnings and curses which god doth therefore propound as by threatnings to deterre from evill for feare of the punishment so by promises to allure us to the doeing of good in expectation of the reward

secondly by plaine direction of scripture as tit

the saving grace of god doth teach us to performe the duties of sanctification in expectation of the happines hoped for
so luk
make you friends of the mammon of iniquity that when you faile they may receive you into everlasting habitations
col

servants are to doe that which they doe to their masters heartily as to the lord knowing that of the lord they shall receive the reward of the inheritance
thirdly by the examples of the godly in the scriptures as first of moses who by faith refused to be called the sonne of pharaohs daughter because hee had an eye undefined span alphabet to the recompence of reward heb

of david psal

have enclined my heart to doe thy statutes for ever is the reward or as the septuagints and the vulgar latine read because of the reward
of paul phil


of the example of all examples our saviour christ whom wee are to imitate who for the joy that was set before him endured the crosse and despised shame heb

fourthly in doing good workes which is the way wherein we are to walke we have an eye to the end of our journey which is the end of our faith pet


and of our sanctification rom

that is the salvation of our soules
they who are in a journey as we all are viatores travell that they may come to their journeyes end and they who are in a race doe runne that they may obtaine cor


fifthly because as the glory of god is the soveraigne universall end so eternall salvation is the undefined span alphabet the supreme particular end of man subordinate to the universall end
and therefore as in all our actions wee are to have respect to the glory of god cor

so wee may have respect to our salvation as subordinate unto it
and who knoweth

not but that the finall cause though it bee last in execution yet is the first in the intention



the thing which bellarmine covertly intendeth is that it is lawfull to doe good workes with an intention to merit eternall life thereby to which end if his discourse de intuitu mercedis bee not referred it is impertinent and yet not any one of his testimonies or proofes doth conclude so much we are to performe good workes indeed that wee may obtaine and may gather assurance that we shall obtaine the gracious reward which god hath freely promised and will freely bestow upon all those that lead a godly life but not that wee should merit any reward of god as due in justice for the works sake
and this is one of the papists chiefe quarrels against us that wee forsooth discourage the people from good workes in that we teach they doe not merit nor are to be done to that end when notwithstanding wee use betterarguments than they doe to encourage men to well doing
but we reply that the papists by telling the people that they are to doe good workes that thereby they may merit eternall life doe teach them to marre their workes and instead of performing works meritorious or well pleasing to god to doe that which is odious and abominable in his sight as being derogatory from the merit of christ
for if christ hath fully purchased by his merit the kingdome of heaven for us then our merits need not or if they need then christ his merit is not sufficient for us
we are therefore in the performance of good workes to have an ye to the eternall reward they being the way wherein we are to walke towards it and the meanes whereby we may gather assurance to our selves that wee shall obtaine it
but we are no to doe good workes to that end that by them we may merit eternall life which is purchased by the alone merit of christ

cap viii
questions which bellarmine disputeth against other papists concerning merits
and first concerning the conditions of merit


hitherto bellarmine hath opposed the true catholikes whom he calleth heretickes
now because merit as the papists conceive of it is a fiction which hath no ground either in the canonicall scriptures or in the writings of the ancient fathers it is not to be marvelled if in this question which is de non ente they be miserably divided among themselves
bellarmine therfore in the chaptrs following maintaineth that doctrine which he hath delivered against us as the received doctrine of their church against the private opinions of some learned men among themselves who in some particulars either agree with us or at least disagree from the common tenes of the papists
and first against holkot and a doctor of lovaine whose private opinions were censured and condemned by pius the fifth and guilielmus alisiodorensis concerning the conditions required to a meritorious worke
which as bellarmine saith

are seven

the first condition is that the worke be good
for if it bee bad it

meriteth nothing but punishment
suppose hee meaneth materially good as being a thing commanded or good ex genere suo in respect of his kinde as prayer almes
for to a worke formally good he requireth all the conditions following

secondly that it be done in obedience to god and out of a desire

to please him for so much the phrase in obsequium dei seemeth to import otherwise we cannot expect a reward from him
this as it is evident in the duties which immediately we performe unto god so it is true in those which we performe immediately to man and mediately to god whom we are to serve not onely in holines but in righteousnes also

thirdly the good works whereunto reward is promised are the

works of men living in this

world who are called viatores to whom alone as the commandents are directed so the promises are made
for of those who are in heaven the question cannot bee understood seeing they are comprehensores who have already obtayned the reward
these three are as he saith agreed upon the other foure are questioned


ii
the fourth condition therefore is that it bee liberum free disputed against robert holkot
this is indeed a proper condition if

by liberum be meant indebitum
for if it be debitum it is not meritm luk

but by liberum bellarmine understandeth that which is

willingly performed meaning no more but that to merit is required without which condition the worke indeed cannot bee so much as morally good for such proceed undefined span alphabet from election and muchlesse meritorious
but though without this condition a worke cannot merit yet neither it nor all the rest which he nameth are sufficient to make a worke truely meritorious of eternall life
howbeit bellarmine should have done well to expresse himselfe whether hee speake of liberum coactione or ab obligatione or necessitate officii and if the former whether he speake of arbitrium liberum or liberatum whether free by nature or freed by grace
for if the good worke proceed from gods grace it cannot merit at gods hand as have shewed before
and it is the opinion of some papists as it was of the pelagians that the virtue of meriting which they conceive to bee in their workes proceedeth from the power of their owne as have shewed before
neither needed bellarmine to have heaped up testimonies of scriptures and fathers to prove that is required to good workes unlesse hee dispute of by nature
for that all good workes doe proceed from the will free by grace and are voluntarily performed by the faithfull there is no doubt to be made


iii
the fifth condition that he who must be thought to merit

be in the state of grace and the childe of god by regeneration and adoption which he proveth against the aforesaid doctor of lovaine
this condition is also necessarily required to every good worke not onely meritorious of heaven for how should he attaine to the inheritance of heaven who is not the sonne and heire of god but also good and acceptable unto god
for without faith it is impossible to please god heb

and without it whatsoever is done is sinne rom

and it is certaine that untill the person be accepted his actions cannot bee acceptable
neither whiles the tre is bad can the fruit be good
neither can a man doe any thing that is good and acceptable to god who is not in christ as a branch

cannot be fruitfull that is not in the vine
neither is any man in christ but he that is endued with a true faith whereby he abideth in christ and christ in him
and this we hold both against the papists that no works of men not regenerate are good and with the papists against the pelagians that they are not meritorious which point good leave hath he had at large to dispute

against the pelagians and so proceed to the sixth


iv
the sixt condition proved

against the said doctor of lovaine that to the merit of eternall life is required the free and

and gracious promise of god which condition acknowledge to be required unto every rewardable worke

for first seeing god is our absolute lord to whom wee owe our

page duplicate

page duplicate

selves and all that we have or can doe who may exact from us what he pleaseth without any reward we could not expect any remuneration from him unlesse it had pleased him for our encouragement unto well doing to promise a reward unto us
but we must remember that his promise is not de debito but de gratuito not of rendring a debt but of giving a free reward for he needed not to make a promise for doing those things which he commandeth which without a promise we are bound to doe and therefore in that he promiseth a reward it is of his free grace and when according to his promise hee giveth the reward it is wholly of his grace and not of our merit

secondly when there is no proportion of equality betweene the worke and the reward but the reward incomparably exceedeth the worke it is evident that such a reward promised to such a worke can no way be due to the worke as merited thereby but is wholly to be ascribed to the bounty of the lord who freelygiveth what he had freely promised

thirdly when a superaboundant reward is promised to a small worke and the party to whom it is promised is no way able either to doe or so much as to will the performance of it but receiveth wholly his will and ability to performe it from his lord the thing promised cannot be ascribed to his merit but to the gracious bounty of his lord



the seventh and last condition is that a meritorious work must proceed from charity which we acknowledg to be required in every good worke
but in the proofe hereof he falleth into a nice dispute proving against guihielmus that the vertue of meriting is to be ascribed more principally to charity than to faith
and although this bee but an idle dispute seeing neither faith nor charity doth truely and properly merit yet durst be bold to affirme that if to either merit were to be ascribed that it were rather to bee attributed to faith
for by faith the merits of christ are applyed unto us and not by charity
by faith we are entitled to gods kingdome by wee are not
by faith wee obtaine the inheritance which by charity we doe not
by faith we are saved and not by charity
faith is the condition of the covenant of grace upon which and no other grace salvaion is promised
those that truly love are also saved it being the proper cognizance and as basi speaketh the character of the faithfull and none are saved without it but yet they are not saved by it nor for it but onely by the merits of christ which are apprehended by faith alone
salvation which is purchased by the merits of christ is promised to faith as that whereby we are made partakers of christs merits and are therefore said to be justified and saved by faith alone but charity and the fruits thereof are the evidence according to which god will save us
christ is the foundation of our happinesse yea he is eternall life
faith is the onely instrument wherby wee are made partakers of christ all other graces are but notes and signes of our union which we have with christ and of happinesse

by him
by faith we have this inheritance but it is had among those that are

sanctified
when it is said happy is shee

that beleeved there the cause of happinesse is noted but when it is said happy is he that loved orfeared not the cause of happinesse is signified but a note or signe of it
both faith and charity must concurre to every good act for as a worke without charity is not good so without faith it is

sin
but if you compare the graces together it is certaine that charity proceedeth from faith tim


and according to the measure of our faith such is the measure of our love for faith is the from which charity and all other graces as from the root and fountaine doe spring and flow
it may seeme indeed that sanctification and inherent righteousnesse doth more principally consist in love because charity is the fulfilling of the law yet sanctification it selfe doth flow from faith which purifieth

the heart and worketh by love
but as for the grace of justification whereunto merit if wee had any ought to bee referred for justification is the entitling of us to the kingdome of heaven neither charity nor any other grace in us doth concurre unto it but faith is all in all
will not follow him in his idle dispute confesse the point that to every rewardable or as he calleth it meritorious worke charity is required


vi
now let us recapitulate his seven conditions
and because

he shall not finde me refractary doe confesse that all and every of these conditions are required to every rewardable worke
for first it must be good
secondly it must be done in obeysance to god
thirdly it must be done by men in this world
fourthly it must bee voluntary and not forced
fifthly it must bee performed by a man who is in the state of grace
sixthly the expectation of the reward is to bee grounded on gods promise
and lastly it must proceed from charity
but now say that not any one of these conditions nor all of them put together can make a worke meritorious of eternall life before god
they are common notes and markes of all good workes whatsoever but the proper notes of merits are such as set downe in the beginning of this discourse concerning merits
for workes are not therefore meritorious because they are materially good nor because they are in obeysance to god for that is our duty and debt which wee owe to god nor for that they are performed by such as are viatores and pilgrims in this world nor because they are wrought by men in state of grace nor because the expectation of the reward is grounded on gods promise which is of a free reward and not of wages merited by us nor lastly because they proceed from charity
for our charity by reason of the imperfection thereof cannot stand in judgement to satisfie the justice of god and much lesse to merit
and whatsoever or how great soever it is it is not only a duety which we owe to god but the onely debt which wee owe or ought to owe to our brethren and that for gods sake to omit that we receive it as a free gift from god and therefore by it we cannot merit of him

chap
ix bellarmines dispute that good workes are meritorious ex condigno not onely ratione pacti but also ratione operis examined



in the fourth place

bellarmine discourfeth how farre forth good workes are either meritorious or are rewarded
meritorious whether ex condigno and if so whether ratione pacti solum or ratione operis also
that good workes are meritorious ex condigno which is the matter that hitherto hee hath proved hee now maintaineth against durandus affirming that his assertion as it is refuted by the common consent of all almost divines so also by all the arguments which formerly hee hath used against us to prove that the workes of the godly are truely and properly meritorious which desire the reader to take notice of because some who notwithstanding would seeme stiffe defenders of merits doe beare the simple in hand that it is but a to say that workes are meritorious either ex condigno or ex congruo
when as in very trueth it is the received doctrine of that church that the good workes of the godly are truely and properly meritorious of everlasting life
now it is evident that meritum ex congruo is not truely and properly meritorious


ii
in the next place bellarmie now taking it for granted that

good workes are meritorious ex condigno hee

disputeth whether they bee so ratione pacti tantum or ratione operis tantum or ratione utriusque whereunto answere that they are not ex condigno meritorious at all as have sufficiently proved before

that they are condignely meritorious in respect of the worke it selfe onely and not in respect of the promise or covenant was the opinion of cardinall cajetan and of dominicus soto
that they are condignely meritorious not ex ratione operis but ex raione pacti acceptatiotis divinae was the opinion of scotus and some other schoolemen and of andreas vega
but both these opinions bellarmine rejecteth and embraceth the third that good workes are condignely meritorious not onely ratione pacti but also ratione operis
howbeit the former part of this assertion seemeth to imply a contradiction
for that which is due ratione pacti gratuiti cannot also bee due ratione operis ipsius unlesse there bee an equall proportion betweene the worke and reward
if

promise to a labourer in the vineyard for a dayes worke an hundred pounds the summe is due in respect of the promise or covenant but not deserved by the labourer
such or rather greater is the disproportion betweene our workes and the heavenly reward

besides that which is due ratione pacti gratiti is freely and undeservedly bestowed but the reward which is rendred to condigne merit is justly deserved


iii
and whereas

bellarmine propoundeth a distinction of eternall glory or happinesse saying that it may be considered either as it is an inheritance or as it is a reward and saith as it is an inheritance it is due

to the persons of the faithfull by right of adoption but as it is a reward it is due to their workes by promise or covenant first answere that this distinction is unperfect for eternall glory may be considered three waies either as a free gift given unto us in

christ before all secular times without respect of workes and prepared

for us from the beginning of the world or as the inheritance purchased by christ or as a reward of our piety
secondly this distinction contradicteth three of his assertions first the maine assertion which in this plac he laboureth to prove viz that the good workes of the godly doe condignely merit eternall life even for the workes sake
for as it is our inheritance or as it is eternall life which hee calleth the first degree of eternall glory himselfe confesseth both here in the seventeenth chapter as also before in the fourteenth that it is not rendred to the merit of our workes but is due to the persons of the faithfull jure adoptionis by the right of adoption as they are the sonnes and heires of god which right they have before they bring forth good workes which as hee truely saith doth manifestly appeare in regenerated infants which dye in their infancy
and therefore it is evident by bellarmines owne confession both in this place and also in the fourteenth chapter that our heavenly inheritance which is eternall life it selfe is not merited by our workes but is purchased by the merits of christs our saviour and therefore is one

and the same to all that are saved
for as have said heretofore as the merit of christ is equally imputed to all that beleeve so the reward of christs merit in respect of the substance as it is the eternall inheritance or eternall life shall equally be given to all that beleeve


iv
againe as it is a reward it is given ex pacto gratuito by a free promise and therefore not merited by our workes but according to the promise freely given and not ratione operis as deserved thereby
secondly in explication of this distinction bellarmine saith

that whereas there are divers degrees of heavenly glory or happinesse yet the first onely which is our heavenly inheritance it selfe or life eternall is due to the persons of the sonnes of god by right of adoption the rest are due to workes by promise or covenant which contradicteth two other assertions
for that which truely hee saith here and in the fourteenth chapter that the first degree which is our heavenly inheritance or eternall life it selfe or salvation is due to the persons of the faithfull by right of adoption and not to their workes confuteth that

assertion of his in his twentieth chapter that eternall life even in respect of the first degree is rendred to the merit of good workes
and againe that which he truely saith in his nineteenth chapter that god doth reward good workes supra condignum above their desert and that incomparabiliter ineffabiliter as he citeth there out of

fulgentius confuteth that which here he laboureth to prove good works doe condignely merit the rewards of heavenly happinesse meaning thereby the degrees of eternall glory and that not onely ratione pacti sed etiam ratione operis

it is true that there bee divers degrees of heavenly glory wherewith god doth crowne his children in mercie and loving kindnesse neither is it to be doubted but that to those whom god hath endued with greater measure of grace causing them to bee more fruitfull of good workes and making them more excellent instruments of his glory and of the good of his chosen he will give them a greater measure of glory crowning as have said before his greater graces with greater glory
for as all that beleeve in christ are equally justified but not all equally endued with grace so all the faithfull shall bee equally saved but not all equally made partakers of glory
and as the greater measure of grace is the free gift of

god and not our merit so is the greater measure of glory wherewith he crowneth his greater graces wholly to bee ascribed to his grace and not to our merit



now let us briefly examine his seven arguments which

hee

bringeth to prove that every good worke of the righteous in respect of the worke it selfe is condignely meritorious of eternall life
briefly say for they are not worthy to be stood upon nor ye indeed to be mentioned but onely to shew the weakenesse of the popish cause which admitteth no better proofes which evidently appeareth by this that our challenging ieuit

when hee taketh upon him to prove the merit of condignity contenteth himselfe with the very same arguments for want of better

his first reason because life eternall is grace for grace ioh

that is the grace of reward for the grace of merits or charity of our countrey for the charity of the way
but betweene grace and grace sine dubio without doubt there is great likenesse and proportion
no doubt but there is some likenesse betweene grace and glory for grace is gloria inchoata glory is gratia consummata
but where is the equality on which condignity of merit should be grounded and which hee propounded to prove in the next

words going before and if both the worke bee grace and the reward bee grace how can there bee merit of condignity in the one to the other that which is given undefined span alphabet is not given undefined span alphabet]· rom

for debitum non est gratuitum
if eternall life bee gratia gratis data si gratis datur then is not due by desert
and if the good worke also be grace how can it deserve a reward and so great a reward from him that gave it for bellarmine hath taught us in the beginning of this seventeenth chapter that if the worke bee much

lesse than the promised reward it should not be a merit of condignity in respect of the worke
if saith hee the master of the vineyard should promise to a labourer for his dayes worke not the but an hundred crownes and yet the heavenly reward given to a good worke doth incomparably surpasse the unequall proportion that is betweene an hundred crownes and a daies worke


vi
in his second argument he trifleth egregiously
he saith

there is a proportion betweene the fountaine and the river running from it
grace is the fountaine ioh

and eternall life is the river which maketh glad the city of god psal

where according to the latine it is thus read fluminis impetus laetificat civitate dei which

bellarmine himselfe expoundeth thus
fluminis impetus laetificat civitaem dei non timebit populus dei quando turbabitur terra ergo literally the place is understood of the brooke kidron and of the city of ierusalem
but if it must bee allegorized then as by the fountaine grace is to be understood according to that of ioh

so by the river should be understood perseverance and increase of grace running to eternall life as the sea wherein the course of all rivers endeth
and therefore such as is the proportion of the fountaine to the sea such is of grace or of a gracious worke to eternall life

this was his first analogy the second is no lesse ridiculous
moreover saith he there is a proportion betweene the ascent and descent of water for it doth ascend as high as it doth descend and therefore the grace of the spirit which descended from heaven will ascend as high
no doubt if it be conveyed in a close conduit pipe


vii
his third reason eternall life is the of those that

labour in the vineyard matth

but the is the just hire of the dayes labour
so is eternall life
the which was given to those that wrought but one houre doth signifie eternall life which is thereby proved not to bee an hire rendred as due to equall labour but as a free reward bestowed by the bounty of the lord who may doe with his owne what he pleaseth
for if it were the just wages for the whole dayes labour then he that wrought but one houre should have had but one twelfe part of the wages

his fourth reason seed in vertue physicall is equall to that thing wherof it is the seed and containeth it grace is the seed and eternall life that whereof it is the seed therefore vertue morall grace is equall to glory

answ
this argument is grounded upon a similitude of grace and seed which are not like in those things for which this comparison is brought
for neither is seede the meritorious cause of that whereof it is the seed as hee supposeth grace to bee nor grace the seminall cause of eternall life for seed is the materiale principium
but grace meaning grace inherent is neither the materiale principium nor the meritorious cause nor any other cause of salvation unles it be sine qua non which is no cause
yea but grac saith he is called the seed of god ioh

answ
the seede of god properly is gods word

sowne in our hearts as the seede of our new and spiriuall life in this

world
this seede conceived by the power of the spirit is the grace of regeneration as the materiale principium of our spirituall life meant in that place of

iohn which alwaies abideth in the childe of god who being once borne of god is never unborne againe
the fruits in respect whereof it is called seed are the fruits of a godly life
for the seed of gods word being sowne in our hearts and there conceived and taking root fructifieth and bringeth

forth increase in some thirty in some sixty in some a hundred fold
the grace of regeneration therefore is called seed in respect of the fruit of good works which it bringeth forth in this life
and further the doing of good workes is compared to sowing of seede which hath relation to the great harvest as also the committing of the dead bodies of the faithfull to the earth
for even as he that casteth his seed into the ground doth it in hope

of increase at the next harvest or as hee that committeth the dead body to the earth

as seede doth it in hope of increase at the great harvest so hee which soweth in righteousnesse to the

spirit shall of the spirit reape everlasting life
and as the seed cast into the ground is not cast away but is recompenced with increase at the harvest and as the body though sowne in corruption doth not perish but riseth in

incorruption at the great harvest so he that soweth the seed of good workes though hee may seeme to cast them upon the waters as

salomon speaketh hee shall not lose thereby but hee shall bee rewarded an

and at the great harvest hee shall inherit everlasting life
but as the increase in harvest is not to bee asscribed to the merit of the sower but to the blessing of god and as the raising of the dead body to incorruption

at the last day is not to bee attributed to the merit of committing it as seed to the earth but to the merit and power of christ in whom

wee are made alive againe so the reaping of everlasting life at the great harvest is not to bee asscribed to our merit but to the merit of christ who hath purchased it for us and to the undeserved mercie of god who crowneth his owne graces in us
so if wee sowe to our selves in righteousnesse wee shall reape in mercie as the

prophet speaketh

ix
his fifth argument concludeth nothing to the purpose

eternall life saith hee is a certaine supernaturall action in respect of the object and of the principles bth efficient and formall but merit which consisteth in love is also a supernaturall action in respect of the object and of the principles both efficient and formall therefore they have aproportion betweene themselves and the one leadeth to the other as the right way to the end
answ
grant that the grace of sanctification is the right way to glorification but no meritorious cause thereof
that there is a proportion of likenesse in the respects mentioned but no proportion of equality
and that which hee speakeh of love in which hee taketh for granted wich wee deny that merit doth consist may bee verified not onely of the love of god but of faith and hope and the feare of

god and affiance in him and other sanctifying graces which have reltion uto god


his sixh argument
it is god in whom there is no want of power

or wiseome to what hee weth who decreed to bring the elect to life eternall as the prze and as the crowne of justice by their meri
therefore without doubt hee giveth them such merits by which truely and properly and even ex condigno they may merit the crowne
answ
if god had decreed to bring us to eternall life by our merits no doubt but hee would have provided for us such merits of our owne as should truly and properly that is condignely merit the same
but god hath not provided such merits for us as hath been before aboundantly proved neither hath hee purposed by our merits which indeed are none to bring us to heaven but onely by the merits of christ which alone doe properly and condignely yea and merit eernall life for us

xi
his eventh argument our merits depend upon the merits of

christ both because hee hath merited for us the virtue or power of meriting and also because wee merit as the lively members of christ and by influence from him as our head therefore they detact from the glory of christ who say that our erits are so unperfect that they doe not merit ex condigno but in respect of gods acceptation
answ
the power of meriting eternall life is proper and peculiar to christ our head and not communicable to his members as have hretofore shewed
neither doth it detract from his glory to say that our workes are not meritorious but on the contrary to give that to the members which is proper to the head
neither did hee merit for good workes that they should be meritorious which is an impudent fiction of these latter times
neither was it his purpose to save us by making us our owne saviours but in his owne person

to merit our salvation by his owne

obedience both active and passive which being in themselves most sufficient our merits are needlesse

and these were bellarmines proofes against his owne good catholikes
in the next place hee answereth their allegations which with many more have urged before

and maintained

xii
after hee hath disputed how farre forth good workes are

meritorious and hath after his manner proved them to merit ex condign and that also ratione operis now he questioneth

how farre forth good workes are rewarded
and hee telleth us that it is the common and received opinion of divines that good workes are rewarded by god supra condignum and evill workes citra condigum
to the former subscribe and from thence disprove the merit of condignity
for if the heavenly reward even in respect of the first degree doth incomparably and unspeakeably exceed the worth of our best workes as hath beene proved then that it selfe because it is given supra condignm cannot bee merited ex condigno
to the latter also subscribe if it bee understood of the sinnes of the faithfull in respect of the faithfull themselves
for the lord doth not deale with us after

our sinnes nor reward us according to our iniquities psal

but in all his judgements he remembreth ercie lam

hab

and ever correcteth us under our deserts ezra


say in respect of themselves for in respect of christ our surety hee exacted such a punishment as did fully satisfie his justice for our sinnes
and therefore he never punisheth properly that is in ordine justitiae by way of vengeance to satisfie his justice the sinnes of the faithfull which he hath punished in christ neither doth hee exact or expect any satisfaction from them for their sinnes for which our saviour christ hath fully satisfied his justice
notwithstanding it cannot bee denied but they are many times

afflicted and the judgements of god inflicted upon them but yet when wee are judged

wee are not punished by way of vengeance but wee are chastized of the lord that wee should not bee condemned with the world
now if god from our saviour hath exacted such a penalty is satisfied for the sinnes of all the elect it may bee thought that hee will exact from the wicked a lesse punishment than will satisfie his justice
some say that god will not render to the wicked secundum rigorem justitiae quos justè posset annihilare but that also may bee questioned seeing of those who shall bee condemned our saviour saith that it had beene better for them that they had not beene borne

xiii
in the last place bellarmine disputeth of the things which

may bee merited or as hee speaketh quae cadunt sub meritum de condigno and first hee saith that the eternall life it selfe the essentiall reward which he calleth the first degree of heavenly glory and which before hee said was due not to the merit of workes but to the persons of the faithfull by right of adoption it selfe say and not onely the degrees thereof which are incomparably and unspeakably supra condignum may bee condignely merited
secondly the increase of justice is condignely merited by good workes wee deny not but that by the practice of pietie and exercise of good workes mens inherent righteousnesse is increased according to that luk

habenti dabitur to him that hath that is doth exercise his talents it shall bee given but that hee shall ex condign by his works merit his second justification as they call it and increase of justice which is gods blessing upon them wee have not learned out of the scriptures neither doe wee acknowledge that wee can by our best endeavours merit any good thing at the hands of god

xiv
and thus you see how in the last part of this controversie

which is concerning workes the papists have magnified and as it were deified their owne workes alleaging not onely that they are good but purely and perfectly good such as not onely doe fully satisfie the law of god but also supererrogate and therefore such as doe not onely justifie us before god but also merit and deserve eernall life at his hands and that truely and properly that is condignely and that not onely ratione pacti but also ratione operis that is not onely by covenant because god hath promised such a reward

but also for the dignity of the worke which is in proportion equall to the reward insomuch that it were unjustice in god if he should not render heaven to their workes which doe as properly deserve heaven as the workes of the wicked deserve hell and that by their workes they deserve not onely eternall life it selfe which they ca the first degree of heavenly happinesse but also the higher degrees of glory and finally which is a consequent of the premisses that they may trust in their workes as being true causes of salvation
all which assertions are insolent and antichristian

xv
but we being in our selves most miserable sinners say with

daiel

to thee lord belongeth mercie and iustice but to us shame and confusion of face and therefore wee pray with david

enter not into judgement with thy servants lord for no man living can bee justified in thy sight namely if thou enter into judgement with him
for if thou lord

marke iniquities who shall stand if we should argue with god we should not bee able to answere one

of a thousand with esay wee confesse

that all our righteousnesses are as polluted clothes as being stayned with the flesh and therefore have cause to cry out with the apostle

wretched men that wee are who shall deliver us from this body of death
but yet with the same apostlc

we thanke god through iesus christ our lord with david we professe that with the lord

there is mercie and forgivenesse that he may feared and with him there is plentifull redemption and hee shall redeeme the israel of god from all their iniquities
wee beleeve that christ by his death hath satisfied for our sinnes and by his obedience hath merited heaven for us that hee died for our sinnes

and rose againe for our justification that wee are justified by his

blood and by his obedience we are constituted just that hee is the end and complement of the law for righteousnesse

to all that beleeve in him that of god he is made unto us

wisedome for our vocation righteousnesse for our justification holinesse for our sanctification and redemption for our glorification that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord

and howsoever we doe teach that those who are justified are also sanctified and that no man can bee assured of his justification without sanctification though wee seriously urge as our duety is the necessitie of good workes and of a godly life protesting with the apostle

that without holinesse no man shall see god though we teach that by our good workes wee are to make our election our vocation our justification sure unto us though wee acknowledge that they are the evidence by which wee shall bee judged at the last day though finally in the doctrine of sanctification we urge the necessity and profit of good workes as much as ever any other christians whether old or new yet in the question of justification if our workes or our inherent righteousnesse bee obtruded as the matter of our justification and merit of salvation then doe we loathe and abhorre them as polluted

clouts wee renounce them as things of no value wee esteeme them or at least as luther said the opinions of them as losse and contrariwise our whole affiance for our justification and all our hope of salvation we doe entirely repose in the onely mercies of god and merits of christ ou most perfect and saviour to whom with the father and the holy spirit be all praise and glory for evermore

amen

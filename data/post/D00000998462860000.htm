AN ABRIDGE+me~t of all the Ca+nonical books of the olde Testament, written in Sternholds meter by VV. Samuel Minister.
The names of the books are in the next leaf following.
GRace mercy peace fro~ God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christe by whose meanes wée are made of strangers frée Citizins, of the houshold of god and apointed to dwel in his kingdome again, so that wée be not disobedient vnto his calling by his holy spirit, whiche spirit, is a sure certain maker of our spirit, that wée bée the true begotten sonnes of God.
Déerly beloued when that did remember how willing· that the Israelites were at the making of the Tabernacle, euery man to giue part of that whiche he had (towards the building of the same) yea and such plentie came in dayly to the woorkmen, that stay was made for bringing in any more.
And also how that in Salomons daies, euery man gaue to the building of the temple more or lesse, and now séeing it hathe pleased our Iehoas to giue commaundement to the Préests to repair the Temple at their charge.
And our Darius to forbid any man to hinder the woork, but all me~ to further the same: (as a cariar of rubbishe or filling{is}) haue thought my selfe to negligent in looking so long, and although that my labour be small, my cunning muche lesse, yet let the frée Masons (or maister woorkme~) bear with me, and accept my good wil, be séeching them to build on as they haue be+gun, that I, and suche prentises of theirs as am: may dayly learn at their hand{is}, at length to be iorney men, the head master of all assisting vs.
haue taken in hand to make in méeter, the chéef princi+pall matters in the whole Bible, keping the order of the chapters as they stand, also beginning the first· chapter of euery book with A. the first letter of the Crosserowe, and the second B. the third C. and so to the letter U. the Alphabet to last, xx. letters, kéeping on twentie Chapters.
Now if the book or part of the same be aboue twentie chapters: the~ begin with A. again, as for example, Genesis hath fiftie Chapiters, therefore because that it should not be to tedious: it is deuided into two parts, as the first part fiue twen+tie Chapters, and so the next, then when the twentie chapiters be done, A. and so B. C. D. E. whiche are fiue letters, and there ends that part, then beginneth the next part with A. againe, and so to twentie, and then those fiue letters again, and so ends that book and fiftie chapters, but some book hath not twentie chapiters, as héer in this setting out, the book of Ruthe then goeth the letters no further then there be chapters, as D. is the fourth let+ter, so hath that story but foure chapters.
Know the letter and his number, then you haue the Chapiter, for the whiche haue héer deuised how that the simple ma~ or other shall tel the moste of all the matters notable in the Bible, vpon his fingers, as héer after is a hand held abrode vpright, another hand closed in sauing the fore finger, which pointeth to the top of the thumbe on the left hand, where sta~+deth the letter A. and the number one, so holde thou out thy left hand, and point with thy fore finger of thy right hand, to the top of thy left hand thombe, and vnderstand that there is the first letter, the first in number, and the first chapiter of eche book (vnlesse that it begin again as tolde thée of Genesis then though it be the first letter, yet standeth it for one twen+tie in number and chapters.
So then to the next ioynt of the thombe and that is B· the second letter, the second number and chapter, then the third ioynt, is third in nomber and Chapter also, then to the top of the fore fiinger, and there is D. the fourth letter, the fourth in number, and the fourth chapter, and so as before, vntil that you come to the last ioynt of the litle finger, and that is the letter T. and the number ninetéen, and in the palm of the hand standeth the letter U. and that is the number twentie and chapter likewise, now then there is no more, but bée sure to learne what number euery ioynt is, and what letter, and then hauing the letter and the number, the chapiter is so in number, as the staffe dooth begin with all in letter, but be sure of the book in whi+che the story is, that you would know, as to make you parfit, héer is examples by order of questions, thou must haue ye book parfet by rote, then one asketh thée, wher is it in the book of Genesis that the Angels came lodged with Lot the night afore that Sodome and Gomorra were destroyed, if thou be not altogither parfet, aske him whether he can say the staffe, if hée cannot, if he haue the book bid him tel thée the letter, if hée cannot neither, then thy cunning shalbe the more tried, wel this it is.
The staffe beginneth with T. what num+ber is T. that is ninetéen, say then.
Two Angels lodgd, and Sodome men, would then haue them defilde: they were and after stroyd, saue Lot and his vnfilde.
THe hardest example is this, where is it that Abraham charged his ma~ to go and fetche a wife for Isaac of his owne kinred, and how hée brought Rebecca the chapter is the foure twentie of Genesis and the staffe beginneth wt D. as.
Now D. in the number of letters is the fourth, but then twentie Chapiters be afore, and therfore D. in that place is four twentie, so that A.B.C.D.E. are some times one and twentie, two and twentie thrée and twentie, foure and twentie, and fiue and twentie Chapiters.
But to conclude, this doo exhorte, that ye learne to say this book without the book, so shall you soon vnderstand all that haue said, the study is good and profitable, and it once obtained, great co~moditie shal you finde: as hearing a Preacher preache, if he say this text, this place, this story, this parable and this sentence is in the scripture, if no: thou shalt knowe for the moste places, if yea: thy conscience shal be ioyned to his, his saying to be true, and also it shalbe ioyful vnto thée, to hear that place brought into thy remembrance, yea and sometime (as now, blessed be God is often heard) a hard place or dark speaking, or a story applyed and expounded to thy great comfort and edifiyng.
And in conti+nuance thou shalt be able to say muche in holy writings, and to vnderstand many things necessary to be knowne for euery christian, which is my only desire, know+ing that exercise in godlynes is muche woorth, and all scriptures of God are good for the man of God, both to be improued and also instructed, that he may be parfet (which God send my cuntrie poeple once to be) that Gods merciful hand may be al+wayes ouer vs, who euer be praysed.
Note that if the book be deuided in two part{is}: then be sure of the number of chap+ters in the first part, and then set them to those folowing, as is shewed thée afore, as the first part of Genesis is fiue and twe~+tie chapters, then A. in the beginning of the second part is sixe and twentie, B. seauen and twentie, and foorth to fiue and fortie, and then A. is sixe fortie, and so to fiftie.
[Figure: [Figure: Picture of two hands showing counting using fingers, forming a key to chapter numbers.]
TO euery ioynt, The finger point, In order as they stand: The letter then, To all those men, That take this book in hand.

G. Ex. L.N. and D, The fiue book{is} of Moyses contayned bée.
ALmighty God did make the heauens and set therin these light{is} The Sun, the Moon, all the starres appéering in our sight{is}.
The earth, the Sea, and all therin, all these his woord did make: With man made last and yet set first, his wil on them to take.
BEgin did then the Lord to rest, From making of suche things And pointed Adam to a place.
One trée denied, and man dooth name the beast{is} after his wil: In sléep to him his make was made, whiche did his minde fulfil.
CAused was man by Sathans sleight Gods wil to break outright: The hée, the shée, and the Serpent are curst and driuen out quite.
For fear lest man should then dispair, with his wife and to hel: The womans séed yt whiche was Christe shall come and make all wel.
DOwn fel Abel, Cain him slue, in offering to the Lord: The iust was slain of the vniust, as scripture dooth record.
Then is he curst and dooth dispair, after his wicked déed: The genealogie of Adams sonnes, and their sonnes dooth procéed.
EUery yéer that Adam liued, is there moste plainly tolde: Whose age was then euen nine hundred and ful thirtie yéer olde.
And so from him vnto iust Noe the chapter dooth expresse: The names yéeres how long they liued with muche of their successe.
FUl wicked were the people tho, a flud was threat of God: With a precept to make an ark, euen as the Lord had bod.
And then did Noe prepare the ship, after the Lords deuise: And redy prest as he was wild against the flud should rise.
GOd spake these woords to Noe his ma~ and we therto must hark: Go thou and all thy familie, with spéed into the ark. Euen so did Noe as God him bad, and took of eche kinde twain: His wife, his sonnes, and all their wiues, and then began the rain.
HUndreth dayes and od fiftie, the flud began to end: Rauen and eke a Dooue also, Noe foorth for newes did send.
Then went Noe forthe and did offer, to God burnt sacrifice: Whiche liked wel the God on hie, when the smel did arise.
IN fauour then was Noe and blest, and murther is denide: rainbowe sent, and promise made with water not destroyd.
Then Noe fel drunk and lay vnhilde, and Ham his sonne was glad: The other hilde him and were blest, But Ham his cursing had.
KNowe ye may of Noe his sonnes, As Sem, Ham and Iapheth Chus, Hams sonne begot Nemrod a hunter on the heath.
Of these thrée sonnes their so~nes so~nes the earth was storde again: In tungs kindes with realms lands, But moste of them were vain.
LEwdly forth went this rout to build, Babel that great hie toure The Lord came down chau~gd their tungs in lesse space then an houre.
The kinde of Sem again is tolde, vnto iust Abraham Whiche went with Lot his fathers sonne and dwelled at Haran
MUche fauour God shewd to Abram dwelling in Canaan: Whiche God him plight, then came a dearth, to Egipt went he than.
Then willed he Sarai his wife, to call him brother tho: The king her took and was plaged, whose name hight Pharao
NEighbourlike yode Lot and hée, And toward the south they went· Then parted they their land and good that God had to them lent.
The promise then to Abram is, repeated once again: That hée and his séed after him, the blest land should obtain.
OF foren kings Lot taken was, whiche ward and wan that land: But then Abram did them destroy, and took him from their hand.
Melchisedech with bread and wine, him met with mickle boste: He gaue him tenth and paid the king, of Sodome all he lost.
PErforme would God the land he had, to Abram promised: sonne to haue he dooth beléeue, and so is iustified.
How that his féed in bondage should, in Egipt there remain: And be restorde vnto their land, and so sent home again.
QUite barren Sara thought shée was and gaue Abram her maid: Whiche did conceiue and béeing proud her mistres did vpbraid.
Her mistres chod, and shée to go, for faring with her fel: An Angel her returnd again, and plight her Ismael
REmooue did God then Abrams name, and calld him Abraham And Sarai is named Sara of whom tho Isaac came.
The sacrament is héer begun of Circumcision: Isaac is plight, and Abraham for Ismael dooth mone.
SO vnto him thrée men apéerd, like trauaylers of miles: Sara did hear that shée should bear, and womanlike shée smiles.
The ouerthrowe of Sodome then, to Abraham they tolde: He prayeth to them beeing one God, his vengeance to with holde.
TWo Angels lodg'd, and Sodome men would then haue them defilde: Blinded they were and after stroyd, saue Lot and his vnfilde.
His wife to salte was turned tho, for breaking Gods precept: His daughters he begat with childe when drunklike he had slept.
WHen Abraham did flit he dwelt, In the land of Gerar His wife was fair, he feard his life and called her sister.
Abimeleck sent for her then, his plesure for to haue: God him denide and then the king, Muche riches to her gaue.
ALmightie God to Sara sent, Isaac her onely sonne: And Agar with her childe put out, no longer there to wonne.
An Angel did her comfort tho, being in wildernes About a wel, Abimeleck and Abraham made peace.
BEing then wild, to kil his sonne, and hée therto was prest: God tolde him that for his great faith in him all should be blest.
Nachor brother to Abraham had eyght sonnes by Milcha One of her sonnes was Bethuel Father to Rebecca
COmmend to God, did Sara then her soule that was so milde: At her ful yéeres shée fel on sléep. and died vndefilde.
Then Abram bought a plat of ground, of Ephron the Hethite: He layd his wife into the caue, when it was his by right.
DEcrée did Abram to his man, and sware him by an othe: To séek a wife for Isaac méet and so he did for trothe.
He went and came with Rebecca whiche Isaac took to wife: So liued they together bothe, and led an honest life.
EFtsoones did Abram take a wife, whiche bare him children more: He died and gaue Isaac his sonne his good and all his store.
Then Isaacs wife euen at one birthe, Iacob and Esau bare: And Esau solde him land and right, And yet small was his fare.
¶Thus haue you heard of Genesis, The pith and halfe the some: Twentie and fiue in chapters past, Sith that the first begun.
Death then came in Isaacks time, and so hée did remooue: That land was plight to him and his of God that did him loue.
The king chod Isaac for his wife, because hée did but fain: And shepheards stroue about the welles, but all was wel again.
BEgilde did Iacob Esau then, Rebecca wrought the feat: While Esau hunted in the féeld, his brother got the cheat.
When Esau came from hunting home, it vexed him right sore: His father chéerd him, yet did hée his brother hate therfore.
COmmaunded Iacob sought a wife and so to Laban went: Esau did wed an Ismaelite whiche vnto euil was bent: As hée in sléep a Ladder saw, with Angels goodly dight: Of Christe is tolde a vow he made, vnto the God of might.
DEcrée with Laban, Iacob did, and serued him seuen yéer: Rahel to haue it was his fée, but Lea did appéer.
And so begil'd, yet did he serue asmuche for Rachel more: He hauing bothe foure babes he had, whiche Lea to him bore.
EChe of them bothe they gaue their maid to their husband to wiue: So had he children that they bare, they béeing stil aliue.
And Iacob askt what his reward, should be at Labans hand: The spotted lambes and kids of goats, that fel in Labans land.
FLit then from Laban God him and so he did obay: He took his wiues and all his good, and stily slipt away.
Then Rachel stale the Images, against her fathers wil: And Laban chod, but peace was made, with Iacob on an hil.
GOds hoste he saw as he forth went, his brothers wrath he feard: And therfore sent him gift{is} before, euen hundreds on an heard.
He with an Angel stroue so long, til day did end the night: The Angel chaunged Iacobs name, and Israel him hight.
HAstely Esau set him out, his brother for to méet: And Iacob sent his herds afore, and came after on féet.
But when they met they gréed wel, God so did woork with them: In parting plot{is} they dwelt in two, as Iacob in Sichem
IAcob no daughter had but one that Dina hight by name: Shée went to sée and to be séen, and so shée came to shame.
For Sichem did the damsel sée, and forced her by might: He was destroyed by Iacobs sonnes, and all the citie quite.
KNowe wel did Iacob all their spite, to Bethel then he yed: His name is tolde, and Canaan is to him promised.
In childe bed Rachel did depart, and Beniamin shée bore: Ruben vnhilde his fathers wife, and lost a fléese therfore.
LIkewise is tolde of Esaus wiues, and gentles daughters all: Hée and Iacob were very riche, in goods terrestriall.
Esau had Dukes that were his sonnes, Euen twelue in number iust: He was father to Edomits in whom God had no lust.
MOre for to hear of Iacobs life, in Canaan he dwelt: Iosephs bréethern liked him not, and cruelly they delt.
Into Egipt then was he solde, his brethern wrought the déed: They tolde his sire his sonne was slain, whiche made his hart to bléed.
NOw then is shown how Iuda took a wife of Canaan He had thrée sonnes two were destroyd, the third was nam'd Onan
And Thamar was the womans name, whiche bothe of them did wed: And Iuda by her had two twinnes, when she was brought a bed.
What an hap then Ioseph had, the Lord did so prouide: His masters wife did him prouoke, but he her sute denide.
Shée him accus'de but not deseru'de her tale as then took place: Wherby Ioseph to prison went, but giltles in that cace.
PUt in prison were Pharoes men, and bothe of them laid fast: His baker chéef, and butler bothe, whiles his anger did last.
Ioseph with them in prison was, and as they slept ful sound: They dreamed dreames whiche vnto the~ this Ioseph did expound.
QUestion askt of Pharoes dream, of Oxen fat and lean: Whiche Ioseph did expound ful plain and tolde what they did mean.
He was set vp, and ruler made in Egipt ouer all: Two sonnes he had and so the dearth, on Egipt then did fall.
RIde out for corne did Iosephs kin, and came to him vnknowne: He threat them hard that they were spies into that cuntrie blowne.
Simion laid in prison is whiles they did home return: And Beniamin they took with them, whiche made their father mourn.
SO back they went to Egipt tho, with gift{is} and present{is} great: And Simeon is deliuered out, and Iosephs chéeks are wet.
And Ioseph could not then but wéep, when Beniamin he saw: They sat and feasted in two part{is} according to their law.
THen Ioseph wrought a pretie cast, Beniamin for to haue: And theft he laid vnto his charge, suche woords to them he gaue.
But Iuda suretie he became for Beniamin his sake: His father Iacob hée did knowe, it heuely to take.
UNknowne was Ioseph all this while, at last he tolde them all: That he their brother Ioseph was, That ruled great and small.
APpointed foorth then Israel went, in Egipt for to bide: And God him bad nothing to fear, for all should wel betide.
Iacob his sonnes and all their sonnes, is then in order tolde: And Ioseph went them all to méet, ful ioyful to beholde.
BRought was Israel before the king, in his presence to stand: And Pharao wild that he should dwel, where fattest was the land.
Then Iacob sware Ioseph his sonne, euen vnderneath his thie: bones to lay in Canaan at time when he should die.
CAusd was Israel sick to bée, by course of natures kinde: And Ioseph went with his two sonnes, to knowe his fathers minde.
Iacob did wil that Iosephs sonnes, Ephraim and Manasses Should be as children to him born, whiche Ioseph wel did please.
DOwn fel his sonnes vpon their knées euen twelue of them there was: He blest them all and tolde of things that after came to passe.
Then chargd he them that they should lay his bones in Manebrey féeld: Then pluckt he vp his legs to him, and vp the ghoste did yéeld.
EChe thi~g was doon, his corps they took as he on liue did minge: And laid it down by Abrahams side, fulfilling so eche thing.
Forgiue did Ioseph all the fault, that his brethern had wrought: And so he dide and wild his bones, to his fathers to be brought.
¶Heer haue ye now the end and some, of Moyses his first book: The second shall in order come, Suche pain the writer took.
ANd then the first of Exodus the twelue tribes it dooth name: Whiche being dead laid in earth their children came to fame.
new king then to Egipt came, that gaue the midwiues charge: To kil the males when they were borne but they set them at large.
BOrn Moyses was and after cast, euen down the riuer in réeds: And Pharoes daughter took him vp and shewd him motherly déeds.
Then Moyses slue an Egiptian and fled and took a wife: The people cride vnto the Lord, whiche saw their woful life.
CAused was Moyses shéep to kéep, not far from Oreb hil: Wherin a bushe the Lord appéerd, and tolde him all his wil.
And bad him go to Egipt back, the Israelites to tel: That out of bondage they should come and liue and doo ful wel.
DEclaerd by double signes it is, that calld he was by God: His reasons all they are assoild, and foorth the Lord him bad.
As Aaron met with him in féeld, togither then they went: Of Iethro, Moyses took his leaue, and yod where he was sent.
EChe bothe of them withouten fear, tolde Pharao God his minde: The more the people were opprest· the king was so vnkinde.
Then cride they out and gan to chide, with Moyses and Aaron And Moyses axed God the cause, whiche looked them vpon.
FEft fully was deliuerance, vnto the Israelites Also the land of Canaan whiche made them chéerful wight{is} Then Rubens spring with Simeon is tolde and Leuy too: Of whom came Moyses and Aaron that had Gods hest{is} to doo.
GOd made Moyses Pharoes God, and Aaron his Prophet: And then God turned Moyses rod, into a Serpent great· The sorcerers did euen the same, to harden Pharoes hart: Then were their waters turnd to blood yet did he not conuart.
HIt was Pharao then and plagued, with Frogs ouer the land: He sent for Moyses and Aaron to take the thing in hand.
He mocked them, therfore the Lord turned their dust to lice: And they put by, then came there ies, after the Lords deuice.
IN stéed thereof came moren of beast{is} that died in Pharoes land: And sixtly sores with botches great, yet did he God withstand.
The seuenth was haile thunder muche that made the land to shake: And lightning great from heuen on hie, whiche causd them all to quake.
KNowledge he yet would not his but God he did resist: He did it not in ignorance, but wel he knew and wist.
The eyght plage next was that God almightie sent: The ninthe was darknes in the day, they knew not where they went.
LEaue then was giuen the Israelites the Egiptians to spoil: Against they should depart and go, and giue them all a foil.
At midnight then the Lord did vow, to make so great a slaughter: The first born of Egipt to kil, as it is tolde héer after.
MAde héer is next the passeouer, and swéet bread for to eat: And if their children axt the cause, the meaning they must treat.
The first born then destroyed are, and robbed were the rest: And so the Hebrues took their way, towards the land behest.
NOw all the first in Israels birth, the Lord did take and chuse: Commaunding them yéerly feast, among them for to vse.
Then passed they the wildernes, with Iosephs bones also: Two pillers for the day and night, they had therby to go.
OUt Pharo went hard in his hart against the Israelites So folowde he with all his train, and came within their sight{is} But God his people did defend, by night and day from harm: They past the sea but Egipt men, lay drowned in a swarm.
PAst whe~ they were this dau~ger great they sang a goodly song: woman came with diuers mo, and daunced all along.
The bitter water was made swéet, and plesant for to drink: God must be heard in his couenant and on him must we think.
QUainted when that they were two months within the wildernes: They wisht them selues again to be, in Egipt at their fleshe.
It rayned Quailes from heauen on hie, and Manna for their bread: And fortie yéeres in wildernes, with that they were all fed.
REmoouing on they lacked drink, and grudge then did the flock: At Moyses sute then had they some whiche came out of a rock.
Foorth came a king hight Ameleck against them for to fight: When Moyses hands were holden vp, then were they put to flight.
SO Iethro Moyses father in law, came Moyses for to sée: Who welcomde him, his wife sonnes after the best degrée.
When Iethro saw what paines he took, when iudgement he did vse: Suche actiue men as loued not coin to help, he wild him chuse.
THen as they went they came vnto, the mount of Sinai royall people they are calld if Gods wil they apply.
The Lord did say, he that dooth touche the hil, shall die outright: But Moyses wild, went vp to him in thunder and great light.
WHen he was come he gaue to him, ten iust commaundements: Precepts to kéep and guide vs by with all their whole contents.
An aulter of earth then God did bid, his man Moyses to make: And if of stone he did it build, no tool therto to take.
¶Twentie chapters afore are tolde, in order as they stand: The rest heere after ye may read, if ye wil take in hand.
ANd then this book, as it is calld, euen Exodus by name: Dooth tel good lawes for magistrates, to execute the same.
That masters be not ouer sore, their seruants for to main: And he that kils a man is iudgd, for it he must be
BEholde you then these godly lawes of theft the fourth paid: He that defiles an vnplight lasse, he marry must the maid.
witche and he that knowes a beast bothe die they must of right: All vsury it is forbod, and in Gods sight.
COupeling wise these chapters thrée, ronne all of ciuil lawes: Iudges are wild to take no gifts, but héere the poore mans cause.
Thou maist not followe a multitude, wickednes to commit: Nor haue to doo with forren Gods, though thou shoulds die for it.
DEcrée to Moyses God did then, and to the head rulers: To worship him the whiche dooth dwel, on hie aboue the starres.
The law was tolde and all the rout, with voice therto obayes: So Moyses went vp to the mount, and bode there fortie dayes.
EUen then to him did God describe the fashion of his place: His tabernacle how to build, in euery point and cace.
He promised that in that house, with Moyses he would treat: Betwéen the Cherubs in their place whiche was his mercy seat.
FOorth on is tolde in these two next, chapters of Exodus: Whiche was declarde to Moyses there as God did it discus.
How that his holy place and house, whiche was his temple tho: Should be as he had it deuisde, wherby he might it knowe.
GOd did also to him describe, how Aaron should be clad: Suche garments might the people tel what office Aaron had.
brest lap and a tunicle, a strait cote vnder that: With other things that he must were, whether he stood or sat.
HOw Aaron should a Préest be made, to him was reuelated: With all his sonnes after what sorte they should be consecrated.
And God to him did promise then, that he would be their God: they should knowe he had the~ saued, from Pharao and his rod.
INioynd an aulter he must make, theron to burn incence: on it to reconcile, yéerly for their offence. brasen lauer he must make, to washe and make all clean: The anointing oyl, with all the rest, more holy things did mean.
KNowledge two men the~ had of God to woork the holy things: The Saboth eke and day of rest, God vnto Moyses minges. Tables twain the Lord did giue, to Moyses on the hil: were writ the ten precept{is}, whiche was th'almighties wil.
LIke fooles a calfe was made there the people were so vain: And Moyses praid to God for them, and burst the tables twain.
When he came down he chod the préest, and burnt the calfe in fire: Moyses earnestly praid for them, yet some were paid their hire.
MArche on forward God to them bad, that they should thense depart: But God denide to go with them, they were of froward hart.
And when the people hard therof, they did lament in minde: Moyses willed to sée Gods face, and saw him but behinde.
NOw were the tables made again, and God his mercy plight: To cope with gentles or their Gods it is forbidden quite.
The swéet bread feast is first begon, and Saboth day is tolde: The first frutes Moyses heard exprest, whose face did shine like golde.
OF diuers things to them is tolde that is afore exprest: To offer tithes and pay their frutes, eche one of them was prest.
Bezaleel, Ahaliab, whiche wrought in silk and sayes: The tabernacle they must make, and Moyses dooth them praise.
PLentie of things did these two make as God gaue them in gift: Kings of golde and curtens eke, to run all in a drift.
The people brought suche store of stuffe, that there was ouer muche: Willing they were to build Gods house and for to make it riche.
QUite all of wood the Ark was made, the mercy seat of golde: The tables and the candlesticks, were made of the same molde.
Lamps like cups that stood on them, to burn and to giue light: The incence aulter it was made, according vnto right.
REard vp for offrings was the next, whiche should there on be burnt: brasen lauer for to washe, muche like vnto a funt.
Of Sicles thousands was the some, that of good wil they gaue: They sparde no cost to please the Lord, so he their soules might haue.
SO Aarons garmen{is} they did make Appointed for the nones: Of costly golde and goodly silk, all set with pretious stones.
So finishe then they did the woork, as God to Moyses wild: And he it blest and praisd it muche, when he the woork beheld.
THen last of all, almightie God, to Moyses tolde his minde: How he should set the holy things, in their order and kinde.
The Lord did compasse with a cloud, the tabernacle quite: The presence of the Lord of hostes, was with it day and night.
¶Thus Exodus is finished, iust fortie chapters all: Leuiticus comes next to it, whiche haue likewise ye shall.
The first Chapiter· ALmightie God then Moyses tolde, within Leuiticus How he should offer sacrifice, the Lord did it discus.
Whether it were of beastes great, or els of cattel small: Of turtle dooues the maner how, they should be offerd all.
BAked in cakes and offering The manner them to trim: If leauen were put in therto, then should it not like him.
Fine wheat flower and frankincense, must go vnto this feast: Salte must season eche sacrifice, where it be foule or beast.
COmely how that the offering, for peace it should be To make accorde where strife was had that hate might be refusde.
Of Oxen, sheep, with lambes and gotes· attonement should be made: Leuiticus the third Chapter, dooth shew the forme and trade.
DEfault if that the préest had made, and doon by ignorance: Should reconcile with sacrifice, confessing his mischaunce.
And if a Lord did likewise so, offer he must likewise: The subiect for the same offense, must offer sacrifice.
EChe one that sware not perfourmd they must confesse the déed: And offer a Gote or els a Lambe, vnlesse he be in néed.
The order how he should be clensd, that toucht an vnclean thing: The ignorant that sinned then, an offering must bring.
FOr him that stale or did deceiue, his neighbour willingly: Or found a thing and it denied, fiue folde restore should he, The dooers euil then offer should, for their offence and sin: An offring eke is tolde ful right, for Aaron and his kin.
GIue for their trespasse the~ they must, likewise for sin and peace: The bakte and broilde, with fryed fleshe is theirs that it dooth dresse.
The fat or blood may no man eat, it is denied plain: Of beast or foule where so it die, by chaunce or els be slain.
HOw Aaron should, lo héere is tolde, anointed préest, then be: And all his garment{is} fit for him, then méet for his degrée.
And likewise for his sonnes therto, to minister also: With all their Albes and Tunicles, wherin that they should go.
IN office Aaron offring made, for him and all the rest: And then the people out of hand, by Aaron were all blest.
This likte so wel the God aboue, his glory did appéer: Consume he did the sacrifice, afore them all with fire.
KNowe wel ye may that fier straunge was offred vp a new: And they were slain for their offence Nadab and Abihu The préest{is} were then forbidden wine, to drink they were denide· But they might eat the sacrifice, if ought were left beside.
LEaue beast{is} must they that chue not cud nor wear their hoofes in twain: For man to eat for sustenance, they might not then be slain: Fishe lacking scale, or fin to swim, might not be eaten tho: Nor diuers foules, nor créeping beast{is} whiche on the earth dooth go.
MOyses receiued a law him giuen, for women that bare childe: Suche pain to them and to the like might teache them to be milde.
Eight daies in house remain they should and then be purified: And offer gift{is} for sacrifice, suche as shée might abide.
NOtes for the Lepers had the préest{is}, to iudge them by their skin white spot that is waxed black, a Lepre dooth begin: All other notes if ye wil knowe a Leper how to déem Let him then read the chapter all, whiche is of L. thirtéen.
OF them when he must be receud, among the folke again: He must be clensd then of the préest{is}, by order written plain.
And all the house that he was in, it must be clensd also: With searching had when it beginnes further that it go.
POinted out is how men should be, clensed and purged clean: If they were staind by course vnkinde vnpurenes it dooth mean.
For women also it dooth shew, that haue their birthright kinde: sacrifice to purge them with, for them then was assignd.
QUuickly is tolde then Aarons woork within the holy place: And how to clense the sanctuary, the matter and the cace.
The feast of clensing then is tolde, how that it should be vsde: And all was doon as God them bad, and nought at all refusde.
REquirde they were wtout the doores, their offrings to be slain: So was the Lord without the gates, whiche died for our pain.
And God did them commaund they should not offer vnto deuils: Nor eat the blood nor carren meat, but kéep them from suche euils.
SO then the ten and eyght dooth tel, what kinreds are forbod: To mary spouse in wedlock rate, whiche are denide of God.
But chargd they are to kéep and saue, the Lord his hest{is} and wil: And quite to flée from gentils trade whiche all together are il.
TOlde then is eke the ten precepts, in ten and nine of L: Let euery man that looues the woord, giue ear what they doo tel.
To steal or lie, or false to deale, or iudge in matters wrong: Nor man to wear a womans coat, where it be short or long.
UNto the Gods ye whiche were stra~ge their séed they might not giue: Who that did so should féel this wo, among them not to liue.
And those that woork by sorcery, thou may not to them trust: And certain kinreds are forbod, in whiche not cope thou must.
ANd if that one did hence depart, the préest might not be by: Nor yet be shauen on head nor chin, for God did it deny.
Also their wiues they must be maids, their daughters liuing chaste: Mishapen men may be no préest{is} of holy things to taste.
BEar in minde those that might not, eat of the sacrifice: Almightie God tho in his law, shewes then who he denies.
The maner how, that they should doo, when they to offer went: All this was doon to kéep them back, from dooing their intent.
COmmaund did God the Saboth day, and Easter to be vsde: The first frutes feast, and Whitsontide, it might not be refusde· The feast of clensing also must, be kept in order right: With other feast{is} that ther are as Moyses them did write.
DEcréed was then that lamps should and oyle in them light: With shew bread set vpon a boorde, eche saboth in their sight.
The childe that curst and did blaspheme was stoned vnto death: And he that kils a man must die, as God almightie saith.
EChe seuen yéer tho the saboth yéer must solemnly be kept No vine was cut, for that whole yéer nor corn yet sowne or rept.
The first yéer were the bondmen frée, and lands restorde again: All vsury it is forbod, by woords that are ful plain.
FOrbid did God all Images, by woords moste plainly tolde: To them to knéel he dooth deny, a man to be so bolde.
God wil defend his people all, that wil his woord obay: But they whiche not regard his wil their councels shall decay.
GOd tolde how vowes should prised be woman were it or man: And for the tithes that should be paid, whiche were apointed than.
All these commaundement{is} afore, were giuen in mount Sinai With charges great them to obserue, from God the almightie.
¶Leuiticus is past and gone, twentie and seauen in all: And Numeri ye shall haue next, the fourth book we it call.

CHuse out to battail might they not, the Leuites in their tribe: For the first born the Lord them took, and so set them on side.
To minister his holy things, within the holy place: And next therto to build their shrouds, they must in any cace.
DEcrée did God what they should doo their offices he tolde: And further then he pointed them, they not to be so bolde.
Eche one after his stock and kinde, ful decently was set: And euery one to kéep his course, with outen stay or let.
EChe issue, and the Lazar man, might not among them dwel: For wrongs then doon, fiue folde restord the law did them compel.

HOw that the Lord would haue the lamps to Moyses he did showe: The candlesticks in order fit, where they were hie or lowe.
For clensing offring must be had, the Leuites they must vse: Whiche when they came to fiftie yéeres offring they might not vse: The ix. chapiter.
IUstly ye time to kéep their paske, to Moyses it was tolde: And how the filde or foren man, to offer might be bolde.
He that denied to offer tho, he must be made to die: Bothe night and day a guide they had a cloud and light from hie.
KNowledge suche had the people tho, by trumpets that were blowne: Were it in warres or time of peace the sound to them was knowne.
From Sinai they did depart, their captaines numbred all: And Iethro would not flit with them, betide what might befall.
LIke fooles the people did complain, and plagde they were with fire With Manna cloyd, to Egipt back for fleshe was their desire.
Moyses then did gréeue the Lord, whose burthen he did ease: On Quailes they fed and kild they were for God they did displease.
MIriam then did grudge and swel, at Moyses God his iudge: And Aaron did consent therto, And so they bothe did grudge.
With leprosie was Miriam stroke, to teache her to rebel: At Moyses prayer she was restorde, and liued, and did ful wel.

PRescribe did God a sacrifice, for sinnes of ignorance: But die they should that wilfully, did sin by arogance.
Stonde he was that gathered sticks, vpon the Sabbothe day: Their garment{is} garded round about, Gods hest{is} for to obay.
QUarels picked certain that time, and Chorath was the one: Also Dathan and Abiron the fourth made vp of On
These did rebel against their heads, And mooued God to ire: He causd the earth to swallowe them, and burnt the rest with fire.
REceiue a token of their euil, immediatly they did: Twelue rods were brought from all the heads as God him self did bid.
Among them all then Aarons rod, did floorishe foorth with buddes: To teache them way the prechers then for loosing of their bloods.
SUche things as Leuites then did vse, did God almightie point: They were his préest{is} to serue his wil, whom Aaron did anoint.
To whom the tithes frutes were paid, to maintain their degrée: And Aaron had an heritage, as ye may read and sée.
¶Eyghteen Chapters now heere are past, of Numeri by name: And eyghteen more ye shall haue next, trust in right good frame.

BEgin did Israel for to grudge, they lacked drink to drink Out of a rock there gusht a stream, that fild them to the brink.
The Edomites would not let passe, the people through their land: Then Aaron dide, and in his roum, Eleazar did stand.
CAptain Arad then came to fight, and lost his Cittie and life: Immediatly when they were come, euen from the waters strife.
Then stung they were by serpent{is} great and heald by one on hie: They kild two kings Schon and Og as Israel passed by.
DEuise did Balack for to curse, the Israelites to hel: sent for Balam in his fume, his cursing for to tel. once denide and he went, his minde was set on gain: He smote his Asse and shée denide, his labour was in vain.
Euen as Balack had then decréed, so went he vp on hie: And Balam talkt with God a while, and spake thus by and by.
How shall curse or els defie. whom God dooth nothing so? And them he blest and blest again, or euer he did go.
FOorthe went Balam in parables, declaring Israels hap: And Balack angry with the thing, his hands in one did clap.
When he had said then Balam tolde of Christes kingdome plain: Star and scepter vp shall rise, in Iacob for to raign.
GOds people then did slip away, and whordome did commit The Moabits in their seruice, had tiste them vnto it.
Then God co~maunded Moyses straight, to hang the rulers all: As two were dooing of the déed, Phinches on them did fall.
HOw many were the Israelites that Canaan should possesse: The whole xij. tribes are numbred all, whom God did chuse and blesse.
He wild the land for to be delt, by part{is} in forme equal: The mo the more, the few the lesse so that no one haue all.

But maid or wife that did the same, without their heds consent: They must go back if he denide, for all their good intent.
NExt then to that went Israel foorth, the Madianites to kil: And slue the males burnt their townes and led the rest at wil.
The spoile was delt foorth equally, the captaines were so good: Saue certain things were giuen to God for sauing of their blood.

Not one to mixe in others part, for fear of bate and strife.
¶Now Numeri hath thus his end, the fourth book it is set: The fift in order ye shall haue, If God giue vs no let.
Not only so but also teache, their children they are bod: The Lords precept{is} both all and some that they may knowe their God.
GOd did forbid a league to make, with gentiles in no wise: They must destroy their Idols quite, and all their Gods dispise.
He also saith that he wil blesse, the kéepers of his wil: And curse the rest and charge he gaue, Idolatrers to kil.
HOw maruaylously that God had de, with Israel fortie yéer: In wildernes with benefits, as plainly dooth appéere.

IN any cace they are forbod, to trust in their owne strength: For who so dooth him wil betide, a faule to haue at length.
Moyses then a rehearsall made, ful bréefly in a sum: From time they had receiude the law til they to lust begun.
KNowe héer ye may of Israels walke, whiles they in iourney went: And how the tables were renued, when they were broke and rent.

To talke therof when that they rise or at their tting down: Or els in iourney as they walke in féeld be it or town.
MOyses once more so gaue them charge against Idolatrie: It to suppresse and put it down, and from the same to flée: And blood to eat they are forbod, in any manner wise: And onely doo as God them bad, and not what like their eyes.
NO Prophet false must bide on liue, but must be made to die: And wicked folke must not be heard, though in thy brest they lie.
God for to trie the Israelites how strong they were in faith Would suffer things to prooue them with as Moyses plainly saith.
OMit they must the Gentiles trades, and flée their dooings quite: And onely serue almightie God, with all their main and might: Suche beast{is} as they might not then are manifestly tolde: And whiche were clean is there exprest that eat they might be bolde.
PArdon their then are they bod at euery seuenth yéers end: When God his wil is serued and kept no scarsenes he wil send.
Those that wil lend to suche as néed, the maner is tolde how Deformitie in sacrifice, the Lord dooth not alow.

¶Halfe this book is now tolde afore, in seauenteen chapters iust: And seauenteen more ye shall haue next, in God put we our trust.
ALl the Leuites the whiche were préest{is}, might no possessions haue: All sorcery they must auoid, their liues to kéep and saue.
Moyses tolde then of Christe to come, and bad them him to hear: The Prophet false they must not way, nor all his dooings fear.
BEcause that murther might be doon, against the dooers minde: For refuge, Citties were set out, and there vnto assignd.
The false witnes must haue the stone, return to his owne brow: An eye for eye, and tooth for tooth, the law did them alow.
CHuse out for warres what men they should this chapter dooth expresse: The law of armes to them is tolde, to vse in war or peace.
The Cananites the Pheresites the Iebusites also: With Heuites eke they must destroy· not letting one to go.
DEcrée did God a goodly law, for him that was found dead: And how the Iew should him behaue, a gentile for to wed.
The first borne sonne he must possesse, the heritage and land: The childe that parent{is} dooth not fear, must die euen out of hand.
EChe man must help his neighbours Asse although he be vnknowne: The man denied the womans tire, shée to go in her owne.
Line wolu~e might not be worn, the adulterer must die: And order taken for that man, that with a maid did lie.
FOrbidden was the gelded man in Christes churche to dwel: The harlots bird dooth God commaund, that they should quite expel.
There might no whore among the~ bide, the Lord did so decrée: The loue of things is there denide, to lend on vsury.
GIue leaue did Moyses to deuorce, for causes that were light: The newly spousd they might not force in battaile for to fight.
For money lent and seruant{is} hire, a goodly lesson tolde: Some leysing left in féeld and town, for poore folke yung and olde.
HOw many stripes the trespasser, should haue for wicked life: man that died without a sonne, his brother should wed his wife: That weight{is} mesures should be iu, read ye the chapters end: Who so dooth vse the contrary, shall come to wicked end.
IUstly must they now pay their frutes, that first to them did fall The tithes they were commaunded to, they should then pay them all, Unto the préest{is}, the fatherles, the straunger and widowe: Such goods were then the poores of right how so they vse them now.
KNowledge was had the people an aulter vp to rear: Afore that Iordane they did passe, or came the land so néer.
The curses then that Leuy was commaunded for to speak: Against all those that did delight, Gods wil to burst or break.
LOuingly the Lord did blesse, the kéepers of his wil: To stablishe them in their good mindes to kéep them in it stil.
And curse dooth hée the contrary, with cursings very great: Those that him looue he dooth them blesse his haters hée dooth threat.
MOyses then went and thus he spake, vnto the people all: Saying to suche as feareth God, the Lord defends them all.
But they that not regard his wil, suche plagues on them shall come: As like hath not béen séen on earth, from rising of the sonne.
NOt far from them that doo it séek is Gods almightie woord: Those that it loue and it obay, are saued from the swoord.
Within our mouthes and in our hart{is} the woord is alway prest: Those that it kéep are sure at length, for it they shalbe blest.
OLde was Moyses and so did chuse, then Iosue in his stéed: To whom he said sée thou be strong, and haue no fear or dread.
This book he wrote and did it giue, into the Leuites hand: And chargde that they the same should read, when they came to the land.
PLesantly then did Moyses sing a goodly song of praise: Unto the Lord for all the acts, that he had wrought alwaies, And vp he went vnto a hil, to look on Canaan: God bad him there to run the race, that all his fathers ran.
QUietly Moyses did prepare, to sléep his fathers sléep But this he said before he went, that God his saints dooth kéep.
Also he blessed all the tribes, afore his dying day: And tolde how they should rule reign, if they did God obay.
REst from his woork did Moyses then and so gaue vp the ghoste: At his departing they did wéep euen throughout all the hoste.
And Iosue did his roum possesse as Moyses had it wild: And ruled all the Israelites in Cittie and in féeld.
¶Of Moyses books heer is the last, as he did them all write: Vnto the Lord giue ye the praise, whiche is the God of might.
AS God afore had Moyses calld his people for to guide: So Iosue to supply his roum, the Lord set him on side.
For to be strong the Lord him bad, and manly for to fight: And from the lawes of God the Lord, to turn to left nor right.
BEfore were serchers sent to spie, to Ierico they yede: harlots house they lodged in, by whom then they were hid.
Shée made them promise her to saue when spoild should be the land: And they agréed to knowe her house, by purple cord or band.
CAre to Iosua did belong, the people for to guide: Remooue he did from Settim ground, and came to Iordane side: Then was the Lord disposde to shew, the honour of his name.
He caused Iordain waters yéeld, and part a sunder twain.
DEcrée did God that his good woork should not be out of minde: And causd eche tribe to rear a stone, as monument{is} behinde.
And if their children art the cause, why these twelue stones stood there: Then should they tel what God had doon to make his name appéere.
EEhe one of all the Cananites were fraid when they hard tel How Iordane brook did part in two, whiles ouer went Israel
Then God commaunded Iosue to circumcise them all: And all the males wt sharp stone kniues, were cut bothe great and small.
FEarful then were the Cananites of Israels power and might: At seauen dayes end as God had said, the walles did fall down quite.
Consumde was all with swoord and fire, saue vessels few reserude: And Rahab saued with all her kin, whiche wel shée had deserude.
GOd then was angry with his flock, at Ai took they the foile: Because that Acan Carmies sonne, had borne away some spoile.
garment gay with siluer muche, a rung of golde therto: Because it was forbid of God, he had death with stones enow.
HAue you no fear said God but go and fight against Ai: Thou shalt it take and haue some spoile, and all the rest destroy.
So Iosue went as God him bad, and fought, but fled a while: The rest did set the town on fire, so them they did begile: The ix. chapiter.
IMmediatly the Cananites with all the heathen Kinges: They came to fight as soon as they, of Iosua had tidings.
The Gabanites dissembling part{is}, with Israel they did play: Because the heads had sworne to them, they were not made away.
KIngs that were in number fiue with Israel they did fight: At Gabaon siege with all their hostes there were they put to flight.
The Sun stood stil a whole day length and haile did beat them down: Fiue kings were slain and hanged vp, so wan they town by town.
LIke hap had all the other kings, and sudainly were slain: And Hezor burnt and none but it that stood aboue the plain.
Not one woord then was left vndoon as Moyses had him wild: But Iosua did fulfil it all, were hée in town or field.
MAny battails Israel fought, ere Iordane they did passe: To two whole tribes and halfe a one, their land appointed was.
The kings are tolde and numbred all, that Iosua did subdue.
Thirtie and one in number iust, whom they bothe took and slue· The xiii. chapiter.
NOte out the land as Iosua wild, by lots it to deuide: He béeing agde so god him bad, to set and point eche tribe.
Ruben and Gad and halfe the tribe, of Manasses by name: Were pointed plats for to posses, by Moyses set in frame.
OF Iosua Caleb did require, the Cittie Hebron walld: Whiche was possest by Enakes kinde a Giant was he calld.
Foure score yéeres and fiue he was, when he requirde his ground: And yet he said he was as strong, as when the land he found.
POinted out was Iuda his lot, the Citties tolde ful straight: The villages not named out, but townes fiue score and eight.
For killing of a Giant great, a man did mary a wife: The Iebusites among the folke, did stil lead on their life.
QUickly Ephraim so had his lot in length and bredth assignde: Euen as a tribe he had his part, according to his minde.
And tribute paid the Cananites and with them did they dwel: Although the Lord had said afore, that they should them expel.
RIght as afore that Ephraim had out his part of land: Euen so Manasses had his lot, where he and his should stand· And certain women had likewise, as they did it require: And Iosephs house would haue more land but had not their desire The xviii. chapiter.
SEuen tribes agréed to send their spies as Iosue had them wild: Of eche tribe thrée went foorth to sée, the Citties and the féeld.
And in a book in seuen part{is} writ to Iosua brought they woord: And he apointed them their plats, by lots afore the Lord.
TO Zabulon and Izachar and Aser béeing tenth: To Nepthali and Dan the last, was pointed bredthe and length.
Iosua with Eleaser and all the Lords and heds: Did make an end of casting lots, and pointing out their stedes.
WHen they had doon and cast their lots then God to Iosue said: him that killes a man vnwares, point Citties for their aid.
And they therin to dwel and liue, til the hie préest dooth die: The swoord of blood not him to touche, if thyther he doo flée.
ANd then the heads of the Leuites their porcion did require: And so they had their whole request euen as they did desire.
Fortie and eyght in Citties iust, their whole tale came therto· As God them gaue the land and rest, as he them plight to doo.
BOthe of the tribes and eke the yode back as they were sent: Ruben, Gad with Manasses to their possession went.
An aulter made, and Israel fluckt against them for to fight: When they heard tel why it was built, they said the déed was right.
CAst in age was Iosua tho, and Israel he did call: And shewed the~ what the Lord had doon, and tolde it to them all.
Muche more he said that God would doo if in his wil they bide: If not he tolde them plain afore, that they should be destroyd.
DEclare on forthe he did at large what God had for them wrought And bad them serue the Lord alone whiche thither had them brought.
So speke they did with often voice, the only Lord to fear: And Iosua dide and Iosephs bones, were earth and buried there.
¶Iosua now is ended quite, the book hath run his race: The book of Iudges now beginnes, in like to take his place.
The first Chapiter: AHead to haue they did desire, in Iosuas roum to be: And Iuda to them pointed was, who fought ful manfully.
Ierusalem they took and wan, great Giants did they slay: The Gentiles with them stil did dwel but tribute did they pay.
BEcause they did not kil them all an Angel did them chide: And Iosua dead they buried him, down by his fathers side.
When that stock all was dead gone, ful wicked were the next: And serued Gods that were forbod, whose names are in the text.
CErtain nations then are named, that with them then did dwel: But one them kild and bet them down named Othoniel Yet after that they were opprest, but Ahud them did saue: For in a parlour with the King, his deaths wound he him gaue.
DEpart did yet the flock and went, and serued Idols vain: Of Iabin King of Canaan yéeres twentie were they slain.
And Debora then did them iudge, whom Barack shée did call: They fought and wan, but Sisara In Iaels hands did fall.
EUen as the battaile ended was and Israel had the best: They sang a song of melody, wherin the Lord was blest.
But curst were some that cam not foorth to help them for to fight: And blest was shée that with a naile slue Sisara outright.
FAre foule did then the Madianites with Israel for their sin: An Angel stird vp Gedeon their fréedome for to win.
The Idol Ball he did destroy, and burst his aulter down· His Father did his cause defend, against the Cittie or town.
GEdeon foorth to battail went, the Madianites to kil: To mickle was his hoste (said God), for him to haue his wil.
So many as feard were sent home back and those that stoupt to drink: Thrée hundred slue the Madianites and made their kinges to shrink.
HAlfe angry were the Ephraites but Gedeon did them stil: Phanuel men and Sucoth bothe, did Gedeon take and kil.
Two kings he slue and then they would, haue him and his their heds: He it denide, but gaue them cause, to doo ful wicked dedes.
IEroboas had thrée score sonnes, and ten in number true: Abimeleck he kild them all, saue Ioathan the Iew.
Who them rebukte, they did him chuse, and Gaal rose in vain: So Sichem burnt and Thebez stroyd Abimeleck there was slain.
KNowe wel ye may what guide they had, as Gods that were forbod: They were opprest and did repent, and called vnto God.
Who bad them call vnto their Gods in trouble them to saue: They did suppresse their Idols quite, to God their mindes they gaue.
LOok out did then the Galadites a captain and a guide: Who willed Ammon not to fight but he his tale denide.
Then Iephthath vowd a foolishe vow the victory to obtain: He had the féeld and home returnd, then was his daughter slain.
MUrmour so did the Ephraites at Iepthah had they spight Fortie thousand of them he slue, and put the rest to flight.
woord betrayd them many times, when Iordane they would take: Thrée Iudges there, are then exprest, and when their liues did slake.
NO longer did they fear the Lord, then Iudges good did liue: The vpper hand against them all the Lord their foes did giue.
man that was hight Manoah had Samson to him plight: His wife him bare as God had said, with him dwelt God his sprite.
OF Samsons mariage ye may hear he would néeds haue his wil: As he went down his spouse to woo, a Lion did he kil.
ridle axt and thirtie men, he slue to pay the hest: His calfe had tilde the thirties land, and went to his fellowes nest.
PAstime to make then Samson went to banket with his wife: Shée went not in so sprang a cause, of hatred and great strife.
With Foxes fiery he brent their corn, Philistians did he slay: The iaw bone of an Asse he took, and thousands kild one day.
QUarel they pickt to Samson stil, and him they watche to slay: But he that night burst vp their gates, and caried them away.
He kept a whoore who béeing féed, his strength of him shée wan: Whe~ he was blinde they causd him play but he destroyd them than.
REherst is then of mony lost, a woman did it misse: Micha her sonne did it confesse and said lo héer it is.
Uowed shée had and would it kéep, an Image did she make: Leuite came and lodged there, whom Micha his préest did make.
SPies were sent to serche the land, the tribe of Dan it wrought: At Michas house they lodgd all night where councel good they sought.
Return they did with ioyful newes, and foorth they went to fight: The préest and Image they did take, and wan the land out right.
TO mary against the law of God sée what dooth them betide: Leuites wife did play the whore, and flipped from her guide.
He fetcht her home and as he went, at Gabaah was shée slain: Then sent he her in péeces twelue the déed for to complain.
UP then rose Israel for to fight, against the Beniamites For whoredome fact, yet Israel was put vnto two great flight{is}.
Then did they pray and God the~ plight, to haue the higher hand: The Beniamites were killd on morn twentie and fiue thousand.
ANd the~ they sware that none of them, the Beniamites should wed: The men that went not vp to fight they vowed them but dead.
They took their daughters and the~ gaue the Beniamites to make: Yet not suffisde the dauncing dames to wiues they did them take.
¶The book of Iudges is expirde, an end therof is made: The story of Ruthe ye shall haue next, so following scriptures trade.
Dearth then fel in Iudaes land Emeleck with his wife: And his two sonnes to Moab went, there for to lead their life.
The father died and his two sonnes, in mariage dide also: The mother then did home return, and Ruthe with her did go.
BEséech did Ruthe her mother in law, That shée some corne might lease; And foorth shée went to Booz his field whose sight shée did wel please.
He bothe inquierd and with her talkte and her intreated wel: Sée tolde her mother at the night, the story euery dele.
CAused shée was by Noemise woords, to sleep at Booz his féet: Who when he wakte and felt her there the truthe on her did wéet.
Shée tolde him all and who shée was then bad he her lie stil: And on the morne he gaue her corne and tolde her all his wil.
DOwn sat Booz then and in the gate his kinsman did he call: He shewd to him afore the heads, what land to him did fall.
He said he would not purchace it, so Booz the land did buy: And maried Ruthe who had a sonne. when he with her did lie.
¶Ruthe dooth end at Chapters foure, shewing whom she did wed: Gentile she was, yet she bare, the Graunsire to Dauid.
The first of Kings ye shall haue now, whom Samuel some doo call: The stories shall declare you how, that Kings to them did fall.
¶The first book of Samuel other+wise called the first of the Kinges.
Man two wiues had wedded tho, the one no children had: She had suche wo she praid to God, who sent to her a lad.
Elkanah was her husbands name, and Hannah was shée hight: And Samuel did shée call her sonne whom shée to God had plight.
BEgin did Hannah for to sing, and sang a goodly song: The sonnes of Ely were vnthrift{is} and did the people wrong.
Ely them did rebukte but small, for whiche God did him chide: He sent a man to tel him plain his house should be destroyd.
COnsumde was Elies sight away, and as he lay and slept: Samuel thrise the Lord did call, who vnto Ely call thée not it is the Lord, doo thou to him obay: And so hée did, and Ely knew, on him what God did say.
DOughtely fought the Israelites yet were they put to flight: The Philistian hoste twise bet the~ down and took their Ark by might.
The sonnes of Ely they were kild, whiche when their father hard: He fel out of his seat for wo, and burst his neck backward.
EArly arose the Asdodits their Dagon for to sée· The Ark of God twise thrue him down, and bated his degrée.
Stricken they were with Emerodes the Ark made them ful wo: From whence it came they did decrée, thither to let it go.
FUlly and whole they did consent, that home the Ark should wend: With mise and arses made of golde, so home they did it send Two kine new milche did cary it the right way home they went The Bethsanites they it receiude, for whiche they were all shent.
GOD willed Israel that they should, their Idols quite destroy: By Samuels mouth and they confest their sinnes to him on hie.
They willed Samuel for to pray, the enemies they did fear: They were destroyd fought no more the space of many a yéer.
HOw Samuels sonnes did wickedly the people did it ming: And not content of Samuel they did desire a king.
He them denide and axt the Lord who did to them consent: And bad him tel what he would doo, when he one to them sent.
IT came to passe that Saule Cis sonne, his Asses went to finde: The Sear fondée he did inquire, who tolde him all his minde.
Thy Asses they are found, and thou the Israelites must guide: He feasted him and on the morn, he took him sole on side.
KIsse did Samuel and anoint, then Saul to be their King: And told him things which came to passe as he afore did ming. Prophecy he did and tolde, his vnckle halfe his hap: The lot did fall to Saule as King, And vnthrift{is} grudgd therat.
LAy siege to Iabes Nahas did, whiche was an Ammonite They did submit he sent them woord, their eyes to thrust out quite.
Then seuen dayes respite they did take then ayd lesse they would yéeld.
So Saule did win the peoples hart{is} in winning of the féeld.
MArk my woords said Samuel then, your willes haue obayed: If did wrong or taken bribe, it shall again be paide.
How God had doon in time afore, and would doo he them tolde: With thunder and raine he feard all, and sharply them controlde.
NOw Saule being king, he got him men against his foes to fight: And when the hoste drue néer to Saule he did that was not right.
He offended God in dooing the thing that Samuel should haue doon, Smith to make them tooles to fight, in Israel had they none.
OUer with one then Ionathas went his signe was true they fled When Saule it knew with all his men, he folowd vpon the dead.
If any did eat ere night were come then die he should said Saule Ionathas eat and should haue dide, the hoste denide it all.
POinted was Saule of Gods owne, mouth the Amalakites to kil: He disobayd the almightie Lord, and folowd his foolishe wil.
Then Samuel shewd him how that God, was sory he made him king: Obedience more he looks to haue, then any burnt offering.
¶Halfe Samuels first book ye haue had, some say the first of Kings: VVherin is shewd the meruaylous woorks, of God in his dooings.
Of Dauids calling to be King, Samuel did him noint: It shalbe shewd you afterward, the Chapters shall it point.
APoint did God that Samuel should chuse Dauid to be King: For fear of Saule he went in close, and faind an offering.
So Dauid being chosen king, an euil sprite came on Saule When Dauid came and plaid on harp, the sprite went out of Saule
BOldly bragged Goliah then on his great might and strengthe None durst go out to cope with him, til Dauid came at length, Proffer he did to fight with him, yet harnes had he none.
sling he had and out he went, and kild him with a stone.
COme out did women and did sing in ioy of enemies fall: They sang, ten thousand Dauid slue, a thousand slain of Saule
Then Saule deuised Dauids death, yet scapte he with his life: To haue his death, Michol he gaue, to be his spoused wife.
DEuise did Saul stil Dauids death, for all the othe he sware: And when he plaid to void the sprite he thrue at him a spear: Then in his house he had béen slain, but Michol causd him flée: And they him sought, Saule and his men began to prophecy.
EFtsoones Dauid and Ionathas compact their faiths in one: If Saule him mist and were displeasd he should knowe how to gon.
Then Saule fel out with Ionathas that void was Dauids place: Then by a signe he gaue him woord, to flée in any cace.
Flée from Saule then Dauid did, to Ahimelech he came: The suttely he obtaind, but by was Sauls herdman.
The Philistians swoord he got also, to Achis king he went: He was afraid he faind him mad, the King was not content.
GO foorth dooth Dauid on his way, th' opprest to him did come: He left his kinred with a King, and went away with some.
Doeg tolde of Abimelech for whom Saule sent and slue: And all the house and Town also, saue one that the crue.
HElp did Dauid a Cittie besiegd Reylah it was calld: And Saule wel hopte to kil him there it was a Cittie walld.
In a thicket he was betraid, Saule thought him to haue spoild: The streight was great Dauid was in but Saule then home recoild.
IN daunger great was Saule the king in caue so it did hap: If Dauid would he had béen slain, he cut but his cote lap.
Then Dauid cride to Saule and said, sée what might haue doon: So Saule sware Dauid to be good, to him in his kingdome.
KNowe ye may of Samuels death· and Naball his shéep shearing: Who angred Dauid very muche, his churlishe part once hearing.
If Abigail had him not met, they had then lost their life: Immediatly the fool did die, and Dauid had his wife.
LIyng a sléep in Abners tent, Saule lost his spear and cruse: Whiche Dauid had and cride aloud, and tolde it them as newes.
When Saule had heard all Dauids minde, his fault he did confesse: And knowledge Dauids reign as king, and last he did him blesse.
MUche a doo had Dauid with Saule therfore he fled the land: And went to Achis King of Geth in the Philistian land.
He slue of them in rouing wise, and left not one a liue: And tolde the king another tale, who did his woords beléeue.
NOw battaile begins betwéen them bothe and Saule to God did speak: He had no woord of God again, when he his minde did break.
woman him raisd as he beléeued, Samuel that then was dead: Who tolde him plain he should be slain, and Dauid set in his stede.
OUt went the heathen by their ranks, the Lords did Dauid spie: They art of Achis what he was, who him extolde on hie.
But they were fumde and said plainly he would doo them some lack: And Achis tolde to Dauid all, who early sent him back.
PErished was the town with fire, where Dauids wiues did dwel: And men and women led away, then Dauid axt councel.
Followe he did and them destroid and home returnd again: The spoiles was delt and present{is} sent the riches of the slain.
QUickly fled the Israelites and gaue their foes the féeld: Saules sonnes were slain at the same time and Saule him self there kild.
His harnes and his body bothe they hung them vp on hie: His body and his sonnes were burnt their bones layd at a trée.
¶This book the first is doon and past at Saules death it dooth end: The second next while it dooth last, ye shall haue we intend.
The second book of Samuel other wise the second of the Kings.
Yung man caried Dauid woord, that Saule in féeld was slain: For making of a lie to him, death had hée for his pain.
Then Dauid wept and mourned sore for Saule and Ionathas death: And sang a song all ful of wo, that they had lost their breath.
BEgin did Dauid then to reign, in Hebron kingd he first: And Isboseth by Abners meanes, anoint him Israel durst.
Then twelue twelue so plaid in sporte, that one eche other slue: Twéen bothe the houses for that part, the battail gan to brue.
COmpany with a Concubine, made Abner to rebel: From Isboseth he yéelded vp, to Dauid Israel
When he was gone in peace away by Ioab he returnd: Who did him kil ful gilefully, for whom the king sore mournd.
DAmpt was Israel with their king, when Abners death they heard: Two of the heads slue Isboseth and had a right reward.
To Dauid they did bring his head and hoped to haue thank: As he that brought Saules death to him, so had they for their prank.
EChe sides were made now all in one Iuda and Israel And nointed Dauid once again, who ruled them ful wel. Hierusalem of Iebusites did Dauid win and take: And battails twain he wan by might, and made his foes to quake.
FRom Abinadab thark was fetcht, and Ozah God did strike: Therfore with Obed it was left, whiche made him wel to like.
When Dauid knew he fetcht it home afore it he did daunce: Michol mockt him and for her fée no children was her chaunce.
GOd vnto Dauid did deny, a house for him to build: shrowded not in Ceder trées, but dwelt alwaies in féeld.
Thy sonne a house shall rear for me, and reign for euermore: Then Dauid wholy praisd the Lord and thanked him therfore.
HOw Dauid vsde his enemies, and linde their liues and death: The Assirians he did subdue, and thousands lost their breath.
forren King to him did yéeld, and sent him gift{is} ful great: He gaue them all to God and dooth, his rulers names repeat.
IN memory came to Dauids minde, his vow to Ionathas made: Ask he did if any were left, that promise might be paid.
Miphiboseth was found and brought to whom the king gaue land: And set him at his bord alway all this he did commaund.
KNow ye may of an heathen king, towards Dauid euil behaued: Iust by their tailes he cut their coats and halfe their beards he shaued.
With Dauids men this part he playd, who did his déeds requite: He did him foile with all his power and put his ayd to flight.
LUst caused Dauid for to sin, with Bethsabe in déed: Shée was with childe and then he sent, for Vrias with spéed.
And when he would not lie with her, he sent him back again: And suche woord sent that he was set, in place where he was slain.
MAruaylous angry was the Lord, with Dauid for this part: When he it wist he did repent, the déed with all his hart.
God him forgaue but yet the childe, did die for this il thing: Then next shée bare him Salomon who afterward was King.
The xiii. chapiter· NOw Thamar was a fair yung maid, and Ammon did her lust: He faind him sick and had his wil and from him did her thrust.
Then Absalon her brother déer, did stil her from her cry: And two yéer after causd him kild and afterward did flée.
OUer passid was Dauids and Ioab wrought a By a woman for Absalon that hame he might him get.
The king did graunt and home he came, but would not yet him sée: Procured, Ioab spake for him, then kist the king and he.
PIck so away the peoples hart{is} from Dauid did his sonne: Rebel he did against the king, this same was Absalon
The King did flée for fear of bare footed and did wéep: Yet had he spies that wrought for him whose councel they did kéep.
QUietly passed he the hil, and Ziva brought him gift{is} Whom Semei curst and he preferd, God in his secreat drift{is}.
Then Husai the rebel sarud, but he was Dauids spie: And Absalon in open sight, with Dauids wiues did lie.
REfused was Ahithophel his councel took no place: But Husay his woords were liked wel, and Dauid knew the cace.
Then Dauid fled but Ahithophel him self did hang for wo: And diuers men brought Dauid food their hunger mooued them so.
SO number Dauid did his men and set them out in ray: And charge gaue Dauid for his sonne, his life in him to stay.
But contrary the féeld once wun Ioab did thrust him thorowe: When Dauid wist, he took on so, that ioy was turnd to sorowe.
TO stay his sorow, Ioab went, and brought the king in sight: Then did Israel ioy it muche, and willed him his right.
Whole Iuda came as they were wild their king home for to bring: And Israel was not wel content, for dooing of that thing.
UP then rose a rebel again, and Seba was his name: He mooued Israel to rebel, to get him self a fame.
Besiegd he was in Abel town, they had béen all as dead: But that a woman found the meanes, that cast out was his head.
Plague then came of thrée déer yéeres, Saules kindred was the cause: When his seauen sonnes were hanged vp the death began to pause.
Of mightie men the chapter speakes Philistians that were slain: Their speares as big as weauers beames, yet serued they as vain.
BEgin did Dauid then to sing, and sang a song of praise: Extolling God for his great help shewed to him alwaies.
He hath me kept and béen my shéeld and made my foes to fall: Therfore thou liue and blest be thou among the heathen all.
CHriste by Dauid héer is tolde, his kingdome and his might: And valiant men are then exprest, the whiche for him did fight.
Eight hundreth men are slain of one another withstood a féeld: Thrée fetched water through an hoste, the fourth made Lions yéeld.
DAuid did then his people tel, and numbered then soon And when he wist he did repent, the déed that he had doon.
Plagde he should be and did require, Pestilence to reign: Thréescore and ten thousands of men, afore it feast were slain.
¶The second book of Kings is doon, or Samuel as you wil: The third shall come by God his grace, and so foorth wil we stil.
Twentie and foure it hathe conteind, and twentie and two the next: In all these chapters ye shall finde, the order of the text.
¶The third book of the Kings after the Latines, after the Hebrues the first of the Kings.
AS Dauid waxed olde he had a maid to kéep him warm: Adoniah did king him self, he fearing then no harm.
By Nathans meanes was Salomon set, and crownd in Dauids seat.
The noise once heard they fled for fear, the head did him entreat.
BEcause that Dauid saw by age that death approched néer: His sonne he charged God to loue, and him alone to fear.
As touching Ioab and Semei of them he tolde his wil: Adoniah, Abiathar, these foure came vnto il.
COmmunication had the Lord, with Salomon the King: Aske what thou wilt, said God to him, for wisdome did he ming.
The Lord it likte and gaue it him and straight it was espied: Two wemen straue about one childe, and he the trothe out tried.
DEclard is then his rulers names and caters for his boord: The number of his bread and béef, that dayly he did foord.
Thrée thousand prouerbs he did write, a thousand songs and fiue: Of beastes and foules, wormes fishe he wrote of them beliue.
EUen at that time the king of Tire whiche Hiram hight by name: He sent to Salomon when he heard, of his great might and fame.
And then they two did ioyne in league, the king of him had wood: And Hiram did receiue again, corne for his dayly food.
FUlly preparde the king began, Ierusalem to build: Ful costly woork he made of it, and richely he it
Two Cherubs did he make ful gay, and coured them with golde: Galaries did he rear also, and all things as he would.
GO foorth did Salomon and did build, him self a goodly place: And made two pillers wunderful and cast they were of brasse.
Sea also, and Lauers great, with mickle things yet more: Of golde and siluer vessels gay, he made therof good store.
House did Salomon then the Ark, and set it in his place: And prayed to God ful meruailously for many a sundry cace.
He him besought for diuers things, would you red them all: And offered great offerings, as there perceiue ye shall.
IN talke was God with Salomon and these woords he him tolde If he and his would kéep his law, be in his house be would.
To Hiram gaue he Citties great, the heathen tribute paid: And thrise a yéer burnt sacrifice, afore the Lord was laid.
KNowledge then had a forren Quéen of Salomons great fame: And when shée had him proou'd and séen, shée did confirm the same.
Golde was plentie in that time, and also precious stones: And Siluer was so plentie tho, as in the stréet are stones· The xi. chapiter.
LOue did Salomon concubines whiche caused him to sin: He serued Gods beside the Lord, therfore said God to him: warned thée but all in vain, thy kingdome shalbe rent.
He stirred him vp diuers foes, ere to his graue he went.
MAny men then did flock in one, Rehoboam to noint: He answered them so churlishely, they waid him not a point.
Ieroboam then did they chuse, and him they made their King: He made them calues and hil aulters, and burnt thereon offring.
NOthing abasht a Prophet tolde, the ruine of the aulter: The King his hand was dryed vp, and God did heal it after.
The Prophet then he did not kéep but brake the Lord his wil: As he returnd for his reward, a Lion did him kil.
OLde was Ahiah when he tolde, the Quéen the kingdoms fall: And of her Lord and sonne also, and truthe he tolde her all.
Ieroboam, Rehoboam, of Iuda and Israel kings: They died bothe then and their sonnes, began in their diyngs.
PLaste was Abiam of Iuda King, a wicked man in déed: His sonne Asa destroyd the stues, when he did him succéed.
Nadab euil in Israel reignd, and Baasa him did kil: Ieroboams séed he rooted out, and ruled the realm at wil.
QUenched was Baasa and his house, his stock of Zamri slain: Amry was crownd and Zamri burnt, him selfe besieged in pain.
When Amri of Thebni had his wil then ruled he but not wel: And Ahab his sonne more wicked the~ he who maried Iezabel
RAuens fed Eliah in the drought, vntil the riuer was dry: The drought continued thrée yéer space, as he did prophecy.
At Sareptha in a widdowes house, he lay, and increast her food: And liued her sonne when he was dead so turn he did her mood.
SEarching for grasse Eliah met, with him that prophets hide By him the King met Eliah so eche the other chide.
The préest{is} of Ball for all their noise no fier could obtain: But Eliah did and causd them kild, and straight began the raine.
UHen Iezabel him vowd to kil, from whom he fled for fear: Then fortie dayes with little food he went as dooth appéer.
At Oreb hil with God he spake, two Kings he wild him noint: Elizeus then in his roum, a Prophet he did point.
WArre sure did then King Bennadab against Samaria twise: On hil or plain he was destroyd, it was the Lords deuice.
But when that Israel peace did make with that vngracious king: The king had woord to be destroid, and his realm for that thing.
AHab then sought a vineyard, of Naboth but in vain: The wicked Quéen hight Iezabel that causd him to be slain.
Possession when he went to take, his death was tolde him iust: The dog{is} should lick vp bothe their blood{is} to teache them haue suche lust.
BOldely so bad the Prophets false, Rameth besiegd to be: But Micha did from them discent, therfore to iayle went he.

QUietly hear me yet a while, God dooth not strike for nought: But for to tel and mend our sin, that we tofore haue wrought Bue if they skorn then shall they die, or if the time they track: So great is God, him to beholde, our knowledge is to slack.
RUling like as a Prince on hie, our God dooth all things guide The storme, the haile, the frost, ye snowe, of him they haue their tide.
To punishe lands or them to blesse, Iob this is moste true: Alone he guides the things he made, then giue him glory due.

BEfore the Lord Iob did repent confessing how that he: The wonderous woorks or mightie power of God he could not sée.

This is the end fear God and kéep, all his commaundement{is}: For God wil bring foorth euery woork, and giue them their Iudgements.
¶The Preacher thus his sermon ends, bothe short and sweet to hear: The plesant song of Salomon, shall now to you appeer.
By parables how Christe dooth loue, his Churche he dooth you showe: And eke againe how shee him loues, heer may you read and knowe.
Fre~dly talke the Churche dooth vse to Christe her loue so déer: And he again so sets her out, as now to bée her péer.
Though foes doo fume to sée their looue, and fault{is} in her there be: Yet by his fauour and his grace, they bothe doo wel agrée.
BEautifully as Lilly fair, her song forthe on shée sings And shade shée took to rest her self, euen vnderneath his wings.
Shée heares his voice as dooue ful milde, and dooth thereto incline: The Fory foes they are forbod, from hurting of the vine.
CAst care shée did her loue to finde, and sought in euery ground: Shée ceased not to séek and aske vntil shée had him found.
How shée did passe from wildernes, with smoky pillers smelt: How Prince like eke King Salomon within his Pallaice dwelt.
DOutles ful fair thou art my loue and blemishe hast thou none: Thy téeth, thy lips, thy neck and brest{is} are comely euery one.
My sister déer hée dooth her call, and looue on her he showes: Commaunding windes to doo her good though contrary it blowes.
EChe thing that Christ hath of his own vnto his Churche he giues: For to perfourm his tresures great to her, it not him gréeues.
His voice shée heares and dooth confes her self to be but bare: How beautiful her husband is, shée dooth at large declare.
FUl sure shée is of Christes looue, and he of hers ful sure: Whose comely state is painted out to be ful fair and pure.
Shée is but one and vndefilde, by Christe who made her cleane: Where puritie of her is spoke, none other dooth it mean.
GO on shée dooth in comely wise ful séemly to beholde: Of all her parts so beautiful, héer vnto you is tolde.
From top to toe shée is describde, of Christe the onely spouse: Who like a palme dooth growe ful trim, with Christe vpon her bowes.
HIm dooth shée chuse her for to teache, by him shée is vpholde: The looue that hée to her dooth bear, with tung can not be tolde.
Shée is again that plesant vine, that foorth her frute dooth bring: For Christe her looue forefigured, by Salomon the King.
¶This song ful hard to vnderstand, dooth end with Chapters eyght.
VVith iudgement great it woold be red, it is of mickle weight.
Though fooles doo laugh and toy thereat, yet be you sure of this: The ioyfull'st song in Bible book, assuredly it is.
Now shall ye hear what Esay saith, he tolde of Christe to fore: Ful Gospel like he telth his tale, now harken to his lore.
ALl creatures he dooth wil to bear, record what he shall say: How god had béen vnto the Iewes ful merciful alway.
But séeing God they did not fear, he threatneth them ful sore: That God would ease him on his gréef yet sauing some in store.
BEfore he telth by Prophesie, how that the Gentiles all: Should be conuerted to the Lord, and woorship him they shall.
Laying aside all variance, and strife against the Lord: But Israel should plagued be, because he was vntoward.
CAst out he would the heads and chéef, of all among the Iewes: And send them children for to rule, he telleth them this newes.
And all because their pride was suche, their rulers went astray: Their women eke should baldnes haue, whose tussocks had béen gay.
DEstruction shall so light on them their men shall so decay: That wemen seuen shall take one man, to be to them a stay.
But after this the Lord shall turn his heauy wrathful hand: And cause the remnant of the Iust, in peace to haue the land.
ESay dooth now begin to sing, a song for to describe: The Churche how like a vine it is, wel fenst on euery side.
But no good grape yet did it bear, but braunches foorth it brought: So curseth hée their gréedines, excesse and things they wrought.
FUl power he hath to Prophesie God sitting in his throne: Dooth send him foorth to tel the flock, their sinnes him self alone.
Their eares they stopt they would not hear their hart{is} they were so hard: They had no awe vnto his woords, they did him not regard.
GO tel the King, God said to him the enemies shall not harm: That Iuda haue conspired to hurt, regard not thou the swarm.
was giuen a virgin should, conceiue and bear a childe: So long before of Christe he tolde, whose comming should be milde.
HOw Israel and Iuda bothe, as captiues should be led: Th' Assirians power he telth before, who should of them be hed.
And how that Christe moste holy then should be a stumbling stone: Exhort he dooth to godlines the faithful euery one.
IN darknes though the Gentiles yet vnto light they shall: Be calld by Christe who is the God, that ruleth ouer all.
To the ten tribes he telth before, that they should be cast out: Because they did contemn the Lord, and were so proud and stout.
KNowe wo and pain they shall that make lawes the poore to noy: Th' Assirian prince should plague his churche and God would him destroy.
And yet to comfort his elect, a remnant he dooth say: For all the spoile should yet be and kept vntil a day.
LIneally how Christe should come, of Iesses stock he telth: And of his vertues and his power whiche far alone excelth.
The mightie power shalbe ful milde at time when he shall reign: His fréend{is} shall floorish his foes shal fear their brags shalbe but vain.
MUche laud praise shal then be made and sing they shall with chéer: Though God was angry with his flock, yet mercies now appéer.
And saying we saluation may, now hope to draw from him: His name we wil set out and praise let Sion sing this himn· The xiii.
NOw dooth he tel how God should call, the Medis in their might: The Persians eke for to appéer his battail for to fight.
For to destroy the Babel power, and bring their pride ful lowe: And all their fame and progeny, out right to ouerthrowe.
ONe cause he telth why Babilon should so destroyed be: Because the Iewes there captiues were but so should be set frée.
And how he should derided be, and come vnto his end: The Philistins for all his death, no ioy should apprehend.
PErfourm would God yet further more and Moab would he smite: Their chéefest townes should taken be, and spoild from them by might.
Their riuer great should stayned be, with blood of their owne stock, Their ruine should on them so light, for hurting of his flock.
QUit him now God dooth ful intend, of Moab for his pride: Because his Churche they would not help when hurt{is} did them betide.
Their pride therfore shall haue a fall, he telleth to them plain: In thrée yéeres space the multitude should taken be or slain.
REwarded should Damascus be the Sirians he dooth mean: And Ephraim that did decline, should néee be wasted clean.
By scourges great they should repent, their straying so from God: forren power shall them inuade, but sudenly forbod.
SUche ships as sayled on the sea, by Ethiopia might: He wilth to flée with wings of sailes, to tel the world the plight.
That Israel was brought vnto, for breaking of their law: How Gentiles should be calld to grace, and stand of God in awe.
THe burden of the heauy plague, that Egipt should sustain: By Assirian power because they put, their trust in Idols vain.
Yet shall the Lord giue them his law and Assur eke the same: And Israel in midst of them, these thrée shall praise his name· The xx. Chapiter.
WHen woords would not make them beléeue what Esay then said: signe he gaue by nakednes, that so they should be paid.
For thrée yéeres space th' Assirians should the Ethiopians broile: And Egipt land likewise subdue.
AGain he telth how Babilon should quite be ouerthrowne· Babel is falne, Babel is falne, so should the noyes be blowne.
Idumea and Arabie the like should them befall: The Medes and eke Persians should bring them in to thrall.
BEcause Hierusalem did trust, in walles and diches déep: Therfore the Prophet telth their fall, whiche causeth him to wéep.
And how that Sobna had him made, a Sepulture in vain: For why as captiue he should die, with tossed life in pain.
CAst down he saith that God would doo, the pride of Tirus town: The marchants that had world at wil, should be of small renown.
And yet when yéeres are past and gone, that for her plague are sent: Shée should again to former be set and so repent.
DEclare he dooth that God wil curse, and strike the earth for sin: Bothe hed and foot none should escape, when that he dooth begin.
And yet not so but that a few, should wel escape the same: Unto the end that they might shew the prayses of his name.
EXalt he dooth the Lord aboue, and praise him euermore: For punishing the wicked so, whiche set not by his
And for the sparing of his flock, and forcing foes to vade: By similitude vnto his saints, a feast to them he made.
FAithful men héer sing to their God, and doo therin confesse: Their sauing helth to come from him, and eke also their peace.
And how the dead in perfet shape, shall rise out of the dust: And how the Lord shall visit them, that in him had no trust.
GOd wil destroy Leuiathan the Deuil and all his might: And wil defend his vine the Churche, and purge her in his sight.
Then shall shée render to the Lord, his laudes with willing wil: When from their foes they be returnd, vnto his holy hil.
HOw God would plague the Israelites who wine so fast did drink: That drunkennes they wayed more, then on his law to think.
The stumbling stone that he would lay, and woork his wil when hée: Should sée his time and point his place, how euery thing should be.
IErusalem shall punisht be, their sacrifice shall ceace: Their aulter shall oreturned be, their foes on them shall preace.
With lips alone and dreames of men, because they did him serue: He would them strike and yet of looue, some séed he would preserue.
KNowing that they at Egipt sought, for help in their distresse: And that they did the Prophets mock, whiche sought them to redresse.
Therfore he telth destruction, to light vpon the swarme: But yet all suche as doo repent, he saith shall take no harme.
LIkewise the Lord dooth curse all the~, that doo his help forsake: And put their trust in man or horse, fore him that did them make.
And yet stil fauour he dooth, faith, to them that wil amend: And cast their Idols quite away, on whom they did depend.
MUche good dooth come when rulers good haue place to sit Iudge: The nature of a churle is suche, against the poore to grudge.
That careles wemen shall lament, the ruine shalbe suche: But when that Christ shal come to reign their comfort shalbe muche.
NO gain at all shall they obtain, that doo the Churche molest: When they haue spoild doon their wil, God wil their déeds detest.
And giue vnto his flock a pause, while he dooth strike their foes: That better they may kéep his lawes, that all their dooings knowes.
OF very looue that God dooth bear, to his elected sorte: He wil imbrue his swoord in blood, to bate the wicked porte.
And so destroy the cursed train, their Cittie so deface: That Oule Rauen with Ziim and Lim shall there haue dwelling place.
PErfet good ioy, beléef in Christe, to suche that héer doo dwel: Dooth bring to them their office tolde that preache to men Gospel.
And eke the frute of those that hear, the preching of it right: To Sion shall they turn again, and that in ioyful plight.
QUestionles the pride was great, of Rabsaketh the Prince: He thought by threats to make ye Iewes, not able for to quinche.
Blaspheming God with spiteful taunts and bragging in the might: Of his great King Senacherib he spake his spéeche in spight.
REnting his clothes, Ezechiah axt councel of Esay: Who tolde him plain he néed not fear, the Lord his foes would pay.
Senacherib blasphemde again, then Ezechiah praid: An Angel did his foes destroy, so fel it as was sayd.
SO sick then fel Ezechiah God did him helth restore: And caused him prolong his yéeres, for fiftéen had he more.
Then gaue he thanks vnto the Lord, when signe of helth he saw: And leaues of Figs vnto his pain, were layd his sore to drawe.
THen was the King reprooued muche, Ezechiah by name: For shewing of his treasures great, to men that were of fame.
And that was to Embassadours, that came from Babilon: Therfore the Prophet Esay saith thou shalt be wo begon.
WHiche way our sinnes remitted be, by Christe he telth before: And of Iohn Baptist he dooth shew, and what shalbe his lore.
Rebuking eke Idolaters, describing them ful plain: And eke all those whiche God forsook, and man dooth trust ful vain.
ALone dooth God his people chuse and that of mercy méer: They béeing those among them selues eche one dooth other chéer.
With comfort he dooth comfort them their Idolles are but vain: No things to come can tel but God ne make that douts be plain.
BEholde he wilth that ready prest is Christe for to obay: In humblenes by suffering wise, for our offence to pay.
The deafe, the blinde, and prisoners, with suche like to reléeue: The Gentiles all shall called be, vnto the right beléeue.
CAst care aside and haue good hope, let nought make you afraid· Thou Iacobs house, for thy God, wil surely be thyne ayd: Alone wil thy foes confound, and eke also remit: Thy sin my self of my good wil, and think no more of it.
DOo dout away, be of good chéer, yet once again my flock: am the same that alwayes hath, born looue vnto your stock.
The Image and the woorkmaster, are vain and perishe shall: Though they be false he wil perfourm, his seruants sayings all.
ERect a King he would, that should, set frée his Churche at large: Cirus by name was he that should receiue of God the charge.
There is none iust but God alone that ruleth ouer all: Who wil so woork that euery knée, shall down before him fall.
FAlne flat to ground is Babilon their Idols eke of golde: Are beaten down whiche in the stréet{is}· their shoulders vp did holde.
The Iewes he calth that they should mark his woork{is} of wu~ders wrought: His Iustice and his mercy bothe, should soon to them be brought.
GOd now dooth tel why Babel great, should once be set a side: Because that shée no mercy shewd, when Iuda shée did guide.
And for their pride and bragging boste, and eke her foolishe trust: That in enchaunting shée did put, now féel her fall shée must.
HE telth of their Hipocrisie, and dooth the same reprooue: Deferring yet them to reward, so mooued by his looue.
Exhorting them to worship him, for that to him is due: So would he out of Babilon deliuer all their crue.
Doo exhort yée nations all, that yée beléeue and holde: The promises whiche God hath plight and often to you tolde.
For sauing helth vnto you all, if you the same beléeue: By Christe and eke deliuerance, from foes yée shall atchéeue.
KNowne vnto God was wel the cause why he the Iewes forsook: The cause was their Iniquitie, the whiche in hand they took.
Yet should they knowe the power of God not minisht long to be: Christe shall obay and vpper hand, of foes attain shall he.
LOok wel vpon the faith that once, in Abraham was found: For am hée, thus saith the Lord, that shall thy foes confound.
Though scourged be Hierusalem yet shall their woful crosse: Be profitable vnto them, therby to haue no losse.
MAke mery yée my people all, captiuitie is past: And ioyful fréedome ye shall haue, giuen vnto you at last.
His messengers he wil send out, their beautie shall excel: But one of all aboue the rest, shall bear away the bel.
NOt one almoste that should beléeue, in Christe because that hée: So simple should appéer to men, and in suche pouertie.
And yet him self should bear away, our sinnes vpon the crosse: And eke the pain vnto them due, so paying all our losse.
OF Gentiles mo the Gospel shall, imbrace, then of the Iewes: And frute shall bring accordingly, as hearers of suche newes.
So God his people wil forsake, and stand aside a while: But yet at length he wil return, and fréendly on them smile.
PRoclaim he dooth, who so is dry, come drink withouten cost: And pay no more to stay your thirst, your labour is but lost.
Draw néer to God while he is nie, and doo away your sin: His woord shall not out from him passe, but somewhat it shall win.
QUe~che not the right, let Iustice passe to Iudges he dooth speak: And saith for all, his house shalbe, therin their plaint{is} to break.
The watche men blinde as Dogs are dum they wake but for their gain: From day to day to fil in wine, there in is all their pain.
RIghteous God taketh hence, lest they of plagues should taste: Whiche he preparde to punishe sin vpon the earth to cast.
Idolatrers they be rebukte, for seruing Idols vain: No peace can be to wicked men, but war and endles pain.
SPare not but cry should ministers, as watche men should they blowe: And tel the people their offence, not sparing hie or lowe.
How Hipocrites look all for méed, in fasting of their fast: Of violence and dooing wrong, suche food we should not taste.
THe wicked by his wickednes, doothe perishe and decay: But godly men their sin confes, and so are doon away.
For God him self his Churche wil saue, when strength of man dooth faile: His woord adioyned to his spirite, shall ouer all preuaile.
UNto the knowledge of the truthe, the Gentiles shall be brought: And heapes of them should come to god, as one that hath them bought.
And Sion that forsaken was, and often had il luck: Should be refresht wt paps of Quéenes, for on them should shée suck.
ANointed Christe is sent to preache the wretched to reléeue: And sauing helth to giue to them, whiche on him doo beléeue.
For whiche the faithful doo reioyce, and lauds vnto him bring: He shall cause vertue in his Churche, abundantly to spring.
BEhold the day right fain they would wherin that they might sée: The Christe that should by promise tolde set them at large and frée. Good pastours ceasse not for to preache, and teache the way aright: How people shall escape the rod, that els on them should light.
COme foorth and doo his feat alone shall God, his Churche to saue: And in his wrath tread down the foes, that gainst his flock did raue.
Great benefits of his méer looue, to his stil shew he dooth: Though Abram doo not knowe our state yet God it kens forsooth.
DIrect he dooth to God his spéeche, his prayers dooth begin: Intreating not that he would think, vpon the peoples sin.
But rather that of him they might, some succour féel and taste: In waying how their church was burnt, and Cittie lay ful wast.
EFtsoones he telth how Gentiles shall him séek and eke imbrace: And how that Iewes for scorning him should be set in their place Muche ioy the chosen should atchéeue, where as contrary wise: Great punishement shall on them light, that doo his name despise.
FUl hie abooue God hath his seat, and eke in hart of man: And not in temple made by men, and sacrifices than.
He dooth mislike when mercy want{is}: oppressed he reléeues: The wicked with eternall pain, by Iustice stil he gréeues.
¶Thus haue you heard this Prophet speak, of Christe his kingdome muche: Rebuking sin with threats ful sore, against bothe poor and riche.
And how the Iewes should feel the stroke of Gods ful mightie hand: By spoiles and waste that forren foes should make within their land.
And yet not quite forsaken should, they be, when they did yeeld: But be restorde and turne againe, their Cittie for to build.
And that their foes whiche once did flowe, and floorishe in their fume: At length should stoup and to them bow, and should no more presume.
To doo them harme, and some of them should quite their Kingdomes leese: And heaps of Gentiles God should serue, ful humbly on their knees.
For magistrates that Iudge not iust, and Prelates in their pride: And people stout with necks ful stiffe, he telth what shall betide.
Now Ieremy shall shew him self, what God by him did speak: VVho very yung was sent of God, his minde to Iewes to break.
And fortie yeeres he prophesied, fiue Kings were come and gone, At home he taught and eke abroad to them at Babilon.
AT what time he did prophecy, and also how that he: Did think him self not to be meet, to be as he should be.
But God dooth him incourage foorth· and bids him to be bolde: So then of their captiuitie, by Ieremy is tolde.
BEfore their eyes he dooth set out what God for them had wrought: How they again and eke their préests, did set the Lord at nought.
Therfore their sinne shall them destroy, so that they shall not say: That God is cause or hath delight, that they should so decay.
CRy out he dooth and calth on them, their sinnes for to repent: So should their Churche be heald again, God would from wrath relent.
Of Iudah and of Israel comparison he dooth make: Whiche for their whoring Idoll wise, deuorcement he would make.
DOutles if truly they repent, God would them not subuert: The Circumcision outwardly, not like to that in hart.
How Iudah should destroyed be, for their vngodlinesse: For whiche the Prophet dooth lament, in séeing their distresse.
EUery sort were falne away, from subiect vnto hed: Bothe swearing false, and whorishe life as neyghing horse they led.
Therfore should Iudah be destroyed, the Caldeys should them wast: So should they for their sinful life, suche sorowes féel and taste.
FRom far their foes should co~e flock, their Cittie to Their sin was cause they cared not when preachers did them threat.
The Caldeys should this reuel make, not sparing yung nor olde: He willeth them to mourn, but they regard not what is tolde.
GOd dooth rebuke the confidence, in temple that they had: For there they thought to make amends though life were nere so bad.
Muche euil should surely light on them, for Prophets they despise: Obedience God better likes, then any sacrifice.
HE telth what reuel forren power should make among the Iewes: And how if that they did repent, they should haue better newes.
The Prophets false hée dooth rebuke, for vttering of lies: Lamenting muche their sorrowe sharp that should against them rise.
IN séeing what disceit did reign, he wisheth that he dwelt: Him self alone in wildernes, where no suche thing is felt.
In knowing God we onely ought therein our ioy to finde: The circumcision of the fleshe, not like that is in minde.
KNowe wel they might that Gods of golde of wood and siluer eke: Be far from Gods when they can not once go· ne stand, or speak.
Their pastours were but beast{is} eche one their flocks did wander wide: In man there is no good at all, for succour yet shée
LOok wel they ought to kéep the law, for els hée dooth them curse: When they were wild for to amend, they were so muche the woorse.
Their fathers steps in worship false, they walke to their decay: To Idols help he wilth to séek, for them he might not pray.
MUche muse he dooth at wickeds welth yet God remayneth iust: The Iewes forsaken of the Lord, in him they did not trust· The shepheards did the shéep seduce, and trod his vine to ground: And if conuert from sinnes they would, then fauour should be found.
NOt woords alone but signes therto, God addid them to warne: But nought would help their life so bad they Iustly took their harme.
Why God to fauour did them take, and why he them refusde: If they would mend the wicked life, they should not be misusde.
OF dearth that on the land should fal and how the people praid: And suche as faith did want to them, their prayers are denaid.
The prophets that by false reporte, did say from God they came: Should féel the thing that they denied, suche peace by lies they wan.
PAst help they were tho Moyses should and Samuel for them pray: Yet pestilence with swoord and dearth, and captiue led away.
Shuld light on them yet some shuld rest, to God them dooth he call: In mid among the rout, God made him as a brasen wall.
QUaint not thy self with woma~ kinde, a wife to thée to take: For plague wil this people sore, and captiues them wil make.
In Babilon: and yet return they shall vnto this land: The Gentiles shall their Gods forsake, and take the truthe in hand.
RIght froward were the Iewes and curst for putting trust in man: Whose hart ful wicked is and il, God onely searche it can.
The liuing waters they forsook, the Saboth day they brake: Whiche if in time they mended not, their fier should not
SUche power as in the potter is, to break his pottes at wil: Suche power hath God (who can deny?) his foes with force to kil.
The Iewes conspierd that Ieremy should vexed be with spéed: And he to God his prayers made, to plague them and their séed.
TEl thou the heads, said God to him, that they shall perishe all: For sheding blood, and offring vp their seruice vnto Ball
Afore them all thy bottle break of earth out of thy hand: Euen so likewise tel them, wil destroy them and their land.
WHe~ Pashur heard that Ieremy preacht he stroke him and thereto: To iayle he went it helped not, he taught as wunt to doo.
It gréeu'd him muche yt they him mockt he thought to holde his peace: The woord so boyled in his brest, to speak he could not cease· The xxi. Chapiter.
AGain when he was wild to tel, what should of them become: He said by swoord and pestilence, all should be slain saue some.
And those should be suche of the Iewes as would them selues submit: And be content in Caldey land, as captiues for to sit.
BIdden he was to tel the King, that Iustice he should vse: If not, that God would vtterly, bothe him and his refuse.
Suche as with wrong their houses build· he cryeth on them wo: Because in welth they would not their pride should come ful lowe.
CUrse he dooth héer fro~ God his mouth, suche pastours as doo féed Them selues: and let the flock alone, God wil them pay in déed.
And pastours pure he wil prouide, wherof one shall be chéef: From Dauids house as King to guide, by him to haue reléef.
DEclare God dooth by baskets twaine, with Figs bothe good and bad: What should become vpon the flock, as he decréed had.
Whiche was that some should haue re+turn and liue in rest and peace: The King should not with many mo, whose hart{is} he could not pearce.
EXiled men in Babilon the Iewes for sin should bée: Ful seuentie yéeres the Prophet saith, in their captiuitie.
At which yéeres end that mightie power shalbe subuerted quite.
And in like wise he telth before, all rule shall lose their might.
FUl earnestly he dooth them mooue, their sinnes for to repent: They brought him foorth, he telth his tale the Iudges did relent.
But Vriah who fled for fear, was fetcht from Egipt land: Iehoyaku of Iudah King, him slue with swoord in hand.
GOd willed him that he should send bothe yokes and bonds also, To Princes, for to testify in bondage they should go.
And who so would refuse to serue, Nabuchodonozer, Should plagued be, therfore he wilth false Prophets not to hear.
HAnaniah the Prophet false did prophecy a lie: And Ieremy did him reprooue afore great company.
Also a freshe he prophecied, because his yoke was burst: That bondage muche should come to them and that therto then trust.
IN written woords he sent to them, that then in Babel were, That they should plant, wed, and pray for suche as ruled there.
For seuentie yéeres should passe and go, ere they should turn again: And in that space their land and power, should wasted be and slain.
KNowledge again fro~ Ieremies mouth, was giuen to Israel: That they should home again return, within their land to dwel And how that God would him reuenge vpon their furious foes: But comfort his afflicted Churche, and saue her from her woes.
LArge blessing héer he telth to come, when home they should return: All ioy shall come and plesantnes, to suche as once did mourn.
couenant new within their hart{is}, also he plight to make: That he would be their God in déed, if they not him forsake.
MAny were the miseries that, Ieremy did sustain: For now he is in prison cast, for speaking out so plain.
féeld he bought and hid the book, that did record the same: His prayers he made and once again, their turning home did name.
NOw is the Prophet wild to pray, for their return and rest: Whiche ful and whole is graunted them as they had had it erst.
With pardon for their former sinnes, without their owne desart{is}.
And Christe to reign in Dauids throne, for euer in their hart{is}.
OF Zedechiah who was King, of Iuda: what should come: How he should taken be and his, when Cittie and all is wun.
Because the couenant they did break, to bond folke that they made: Their lot with pine or pestilence, should be or els with blade.
PUt foorth he dooth as God him bade, the Rechabites for lore: Who would not break the olde precept{is} from fathers had tofore.
But Iewishe pride would not obey, though often they were warnd: Therfore to ruine they should go, the Rechabites not harmd.
QUenched lest yt his woords should be, God bad to write them all: So Baruch did and red the role, before bothe great and small.
The King a little heard of it, and burnt the book in fire: Again with more it written was, and God prouokte to ire.
RIght soon as Zedechiah reignd, to Ieremy he sent, To pray for him.
As Ieremy was prest away, in dungeon was he cast: But when the King had talkt with him, he begd a better taste.
SO fairly spake the councellours, the Princes eares vntil, That Ieremy to dungeon went, there thought they him to kil.
An Enuche black his life did saue, and drue him vp with cordes: The King and he did talke alone, he might not tel the Lords.
THe Babel power the Cittie took, and Zedechiah fled: He was ouer caught, his sonnes were slain his eyes put out of his hed.
The poore alone are left in land, and Ieremy at large: Who gaue them more that did him good, a comfortable charge.
UNto two things the Prophet had a choise at wil to chuse.
Babel to sée, or tary stil the first he did refuse.
Suche as for fear were fled away to Godoliah came: Whom Babel King had left to rule, all Iudah that he wan.
Murder foule committed was of Ismael by name: For Godoliah he did kil, who did deserue no blame.
And diuers more that wicked man, their liues did also end: And fled to King of Moabites who therfore did him send.
BOthe moste and least to Ieremy came his councel to haue: And willed him to knowe of God, whiche way them selues to saue.
Who willed them in any wise, to Egipt not to wend: For if they did that whiche they feard, their God would it them send.
COntrary to their former graunt, to Egipt néeds they would: The Prophet checkt, and Baruch eke, who néeds with them they should.
And there did God by Ieremy tel Egipt of her fall: How Nebuchadnezer in place should rule their Gods and all.
DEclare he dooth vnto the Iewes, for their Idolatrie, In Egipt land the whiche they did, that they should surely die.
But men and wiues with froward hart{is} did tel what they did deem: We neuer throue sins that we left, to serue the heauenly Quéen.
EUilly appaid was Baruch then, he thought his life but lost: His sorrowes did increace in him séeing the Iewes so tost.
But Ieremy him comfort gaue, and set his hart at stay: For God (he said) hath giuen to thée, thy life to be a pray.
FRom God he speaks to Egipt land, and telleth them ful plain: How that the King of Babilon withall his mightie train.
Should them destroy and eke their King their God and mightie power: But yet his chosen Iacobs séed, he would not quite deuour.
GOd bad him tel the Philistins of their decay and end: That parents to suche wo should come, their Children not to tend.
How they of Tire and Zidon eke, should wasted be also: The wrath of God not ceasing til, their pride were come ful lowe.
HE telleh to the Moabites their ruine and decay: Who once like churles to Israel vngraciously did say.
He curseth them that should them spare, or stay his hand from blood: And that because their pride was suche, and hautie stubborn mood.
IN like (he saith) the Ammonites whose valleyes were so fair And Esaus stock the Edomites that thought of no dispair.
Damascus and Kedar also, whom nothing did anoy: With Elam eke, all these he said, the Caldes should destroy.
KNoweledge tofore of Babels fall, he gaue also to them: How that the Persians and the Medes should quite destroy their steme· And how that God vpon his flock, would haue a new regard: And them restore into their state, and giue their foes reward.
LArgely he writes and telth the cause, of Babels fall and spoile: In Israels blood they did reioyce, when that they had the foile.
The power of God he dooth describe, and Idols vain denies: He saith the Caldeys should so fall, as neuer more to rise.
MArk wel what rebels come vnto, let Zedechiah preache: He first rebeld and after fled, his foes did him areche.
The temple burnt, the Cittie stroyd, and thousands captiue led: But Iehoyakim fauour found, the King lift vp his hed. FINIS.
¶Thus Ieremy that liued so long, and Kings so many saw: That bode suche broyles for saying sooth, to those that had no awe.
His tale is tolde, his book is doon, now shall you hear vs tel, How wofully he did lament, the fall of Israel.
ALl help is past, Hierusalem is now subuerted quite: Her fréends are now become her foes when fayled is her might.
Her stréet{is} are void her préest{is} are slain, her foes they doo reioice: Nothing but teares and heuines, hath sin set for her choice.
BEholde the holdes are now destroyd, the Princes ouerthrowne: The Saboths and the holy place, they cannot now be knowne.
The Uirgins and the Seniours, sit wéeping on the ground: The enemies doo clap their hands, no comfort can be found.
COmplain he dooth of all the gréefs, that many wayes he felt: And yet in God he puts his trust, that alwayes his hath helpt.
For sin, the Lord dooth his correct, whiche best is to confesse: And then he wil his fauour send, and things amisse redresse.
DOutles the wise like to fine Golde, are now like potters clay: The Nazarites that were so fair, their beautie is away.
With hunger wemen sore opprest, their Children they doo eat: The bloody préest{is} and Prophets false did bring to them this meat.
ENd héer his Lamentations, hée dooth with earnest prayer: Beséeching God to look vpon, how foes with them did fare.
Confessing yet that he dooth reign and shall for euermore: Who turning vs then shall we turn, and surely not before.
¶Ezechiel dooth now begin, to fortifie and prooue: That God would sure the Iewishe Churche, as he had said, remooue.
By visions straunge he dooth expresse, the things to come to passe: As he in Caldey land did dwel, where he a captiue was.
Yet comfort dooth he giue again, to the afflicted flock: And telth the ruine of their foes, and suche as did them mock.
But cheef of all the regiment, of Christes kingdome pure, He dooth see out an happy state, for euer to indure.
AS he in Caldey land did dwel, by Chobar riuer side: In the fift yéer that Iehoyakim the King did there abide.
Ezechiel a vision, of foules and whéeles did sée: And one vpon a bowe did sit, on hie in maiestie.
BIdden he was for to stand vp, and speak against the Iewes, Their sinnes rebuke, how they should his preaching quite refuse.
Rebelling stil, as auncetours of them had doon before: hand he saw that helde a book, that sorrowes threat therfore.
CAused he was to eat the book, and boldenes God him gaue With strength power, wt woord sprite him self for to behaue.
His charge is giuen, his office set, whiche if he should neglect, The folke in sin should perishe all, and he for blood be checkt.
DEclare he dooth Hierusalem besieged for to bée: And many yéeres the Israelites to féel captiuitie.
And hunger suche on them to fall, as like hath not béen heard: Their excrement{is} of force to eat, good food should be so bard.
EFtsoones a signe to him was giuen, by shauing of his hear: By burning some, by wherling some, and little some to spare.
That so with the Pestilence, with swoord and famine great: Should be disperst and eke so plagued, as Childe the Fathers meat.
FOr woorshipping of Images, and Idols that are vain: On tops on hils, and eke in vales, he saith they shalbe slain.
remnant yet there shalbe left, that in their woful gréef: Shall them repent and turn to God, and haue of him reléef.
GOd dooth by him tel plainly out, the ruine of the land: From Est to west, from north to south, no part of it to stand.
But all should be subuerted quite, he wil not chaunge his minde: In préest or els in auncient man, no councel should they finde.
HE sitting in his house among, the auncients in exile, Hierusalem he went vnto, in vision for a while.
And there suche euils in secret place, he saw them to commit And eke abrode whiche caused iust, them to be plagde for it.
IErusalem that did commit, suche euils as were to bad, Hath now suche measure méett to them, as once they mesured had.
But one yclad in linnen white, did mark the mourning sort· And they did scape when ruine fel, the marker made report.
KNowe moore he dooth of things tofore, The man arayd in white: Did fier fetche from Cherubins, appearing to his sight.
And then the beast{is} and eke the whéeles, that he had séen tofore: He saw again in vision wise, with sundry faces foure.
LEd now he was for to beholde the chéef that ruled il: And wild to say that they should pay, for blood that they did spil.
ruler died, then out he cride to God to holde his hand: His bown is heard, and Cherubs gone, and he in Caldey land.
MOre plainly by a fardle born, and packing in the day: Their thraldome and captiuitie, thereby perceiue they may.
remnant yet should saued be, to tel of all their gilt: And spéedely the wrath should come, though otherwaies they built.
NOw dooth he tel the Prophets false, what should of them betide: Their daubed wall that they had made, it not long abide.
Their women eke that pillowes made, and kercheues for to charme, Should perishe to, for promising the wicked safe from harm.
OF suche as Idols in their hart{is} did kéep, and yet pretends· The contrary, and Prophets false, he telth of bothe their ends.
Yet stil a remnant God wil kéep, his Churche for to increace: The righteous men alone shall scape, their sin he wil releace.
PRofitable is not the wood, that commeth of the vine: No longer then it beareth frute, wherof is made the wine: Euen so likewise Hierusalem that bringeth foorth no frute, Shalbe consumde with fier at home and eke in her pursute.
QUenche now their pride, he go'th about their progeny to tel: How bare they were, how God the~ clad, they did that was not wel.
For Sodome nor Samaria suche whordome woorked not: In woorship false to Idoles vain, as neuer more was wrought.
REherse he dooth by Egles twain, what shall of Israel hap: Who thought to plant in Egipt power, but it should take no sap.
Their King also that promise made, to Babel to obay: For breaking of his othe to him, ful déerly he should pay.
(wher it falth) shal haue reward, in him that dooth it vse: Eche man shall bear his owne offence, he shall none other chuse.
But who so dooth his sin repent, shall pardon haue therfore: And he that dooth good life forsake, shall pay ful déer therfore.
TEl now he dooth what Lions sprang out of the Lionesse: What catching Kings, Hierusalem did bréed to her distresse.
How as a vine shée floorisht once, and did from thence decay: And therfore now in wildernes, there should shée dry away.
UNto him came the elders then, who did to them declare, For all their sin from time to time, how God yet did them spare, Not hearing suche as yéelded not, but wrath vpon them take, And spare the rest that feared him, euen for his mercies sake.
Swoord hée saith shall all deuoure and spare ne hie nor lowe: The Babel power should all destroy, inchauntment taught him so.
The Ammonites should also quaile, their kingdome should be wun: The Babel power should them destroy, where they their life begun.
BEholde this chapter, mark it wel, how all was out of frame: What sinnes there reignd in Israel he dooth vnto you name.
The rulers and the Prophets eke, the préest{is} and people all, In sundry sinnes withouten shame eche one of them did fall.
COmparison of women twain, that whoredome doo commit, He dooth compare to Israel and Iuda like to it.
Whose filthy foule Idolatrie, prouoked God to ire: The Childe first born they spared not, to burn in flaming fire.
DEclare he dooth by double signes, what they shall come vntil: As fleshe in pot dooth séethe to scum, so should they for their il.
His wife dooth die, he mourned not, as he of God was wild: No more should they haue space thereto, when that their fréends were kild.
EUil hap should come of Ammonites and Moabites by name: Because they did reioyce and laugh, when Israel had blame.
The Edomites and Philistines should eke stoup to the Est, That is to say to Babel power, and be of them possest.
FOr like offence that Cittie great, that Tirus by name: Should haue the foile and be possest of straungers to their shame.
The Iles and merchant{is} wunder shall, when they shall hear the same: Cittie new in ruine great, that was of mickle fame.
GReat was the welth that Tirus had, he dooth tel it at length: Their fame, their name, their quiet state their power and eke their strength.
All these with all their men and might, their force by sea and land: Should be destroyd for euermore, by might of forren band.
HE telleth now what pride he had, that Tirus rul'd as King: And of his fall and Cittie eke, they fearing no suche thing.
To Zidon to he shewes asmuche, that like on them should fall: And how Gods folke should liue in peace when foes were stroyed all.
IN like he saith that Egipt power, should quite be ouer run: And fortie yéeres it should lie waste, after that it were wun.
The King of Babel should it haue, to be his souldiours gaines: Because at Tirus they did win small profit for their paines.
KNowe wel you may he dooth not fain but telth again their wo: Their cu~trie spoild, their Citties down, their neighbours serued so.
Their Idols eke should be defaste, their strength should not auaile: Their foes with force of God his power so fiercely should assail.
LIke power to the Assirians in Egipt could not be: And yet Nabuchodonozer the same destroyed he.
This he dooth tel that they should think, that they might not withstand The rage of Babel when it com'th, for to destroy the land.
MUche more to make now is he wild, for Pharo that was King, Who should be slain, and riuer ful of blood should ouer spring.
As other Kings were ouerrun, and brought vnto the pit, So Egipt pride should haue a fall, as iust reward for it.
NOte wel this thing when preachers preache warning men doo giue, They be dischargd if they repent: they shalbe sure to liue.
Eche man shall bear his owne offence, the godly shall haue méed: They that did rest and at him iest, ful wickedly should spéed.
OF shepheards that their profit séek, and not the shéep to féed, He dooth describe what God wil doo, euen pay them for their méed, And take his flock in hand him self, deuiding shéep from shéep, And giue the flock at length to Christe, whiche truly shall them kéep.
PUblishe vnto Idumea he dooth what God would doo: Because that Israel they had gréeu'd, they should be gréeued to.
As blooddely the Israelites they had with war opprest: So should their blood be spilt again, and none of them haue rest.
QUicken he dooth the Israelites that they should not dispair: For God would all their foes destroy, and them again repair.
His mercy onely moouing him, and not of their desart{is}, And take from them their stony mindes, and giue them fleshy hart{is}.
RIght soon as he in féeld was set, a miracle he wrought: For dried bones took fleshe and breath, that God vnto them brought.
By whiche he telth that Israel that séemed to be gone, Should safe return and Iuda bothe, and be eke ioynd in one.
SUche enemies as should arise he dooth them héer describe: As Gog and Magog in their power, the Churche for to deride.
And they to come in latter dayes, as Prophets tolde tofore: Yet God should stay their furious rage, and punishe them therfore.
THe Lord is bent against this Gog a wretched end to haue: Their slaughter such seue~ month{is} to séek to bring them vnto graue.
Then shall his people rest in peace, and heathen tolde the cause: Why Israel afflicted was, for breaking of his lawes.
UNto the Cittie he is rapt, and there he dooth beholde The building of it fair again, as it was to him tolde.
From gate to gate all mesurde out an angel with a réed An eke a line, did point the same, as it should be in déed.
AT large to him described was, the temple then of God: And mesurde out by Cubits méet, euen with a réedy rod.
The holy place, the Cherubins, and eke the Palmy trées: The courts, the doores, with all at large, in vision he sées.
BRought now he is to th'vtter court, the chambers for to sée: In length and bredth, and tolde he is that there the préest{is} should be Apointed for to tire them selues, their portion eke to eat: And holy rowmes therin, to lay, the sacrificing meat.
COme now he is for to beholde, the glory of the Lord: Who wilth him tel the Israelites that they shalbe restorde, If they repent their former life, and doo no more there after: Then dooth he sée set out to him, the fashion of the aulter.
DEclare he dooth good wholesom rules his préest{is} for to obserue: Look whiche of them had Idols likte, as préest{is} they might not serue.
What robes to were, what wiues to take, to them is héer exprest: At burials they might not come, ne féed of rented beast.
ELect apart foure portions were within the holy land: For Préest{is}, for Prince, for Cittie and Churche, eche lot set out with wand.
lesson giuen to Magistrates for measure and for weight: Oblations eke how them to make, is héer set out ful streight.
FOr sacrifice on Saboth dayes, the order héer they knowe: In temple where the folke came in, ther out they might not go.
The Prince in middle of them all, must be when God they serue: Til he go out a charge they haue, from him they may not swarue.
GOd dooth him shew the plesa~t stremes that from the gates should run: What plentie of fishe should therin be, for fisher men to come.
On sides wherof what trées should grow that monthly frute should bear: The borders of the holy land, it is appointed there.
HEer now by lot is pointed out, eche tribe how he should lie: The préest{is} and Leuites haue their parts the holy temple by.
Whose portion eke is pointed out, and all the Citties shore: The Prince again his part is tolde, this Prophet speakes no more.
¶Thus haue you heard this Prophet speak, vnto the people tho: That captiues were in Caldey land, and vnto sundry mo.
Now commeth in that man of wit, a Seer you may say: VVho tolde before of Monarchies, their reign and their decay.
The Romaine power he telleth of, of Turk and Antechriste: Of golden dayes that should be seen, in regiment of Christe.
His name to tel is Daniel, that deemed doughtie dreames: VVho stil did win of enemies, for all their craftie meanes.
ANd when the King of Babilon Hierusalem had wun: Yung men of Iewes for to be kept, he willed to be doon.
Their fare was set they it refusde, and eat and drank ful hard: Yet were they fair and wisdome had none were to them comparde.
BUt Daniel there was not one, could tel the King his dream: Who tolde it him and this therto, the truthe what it did mean.
For whiche he was a ruler made, the chéef and next the King: His fellowes thrée did rule also, to whiche he did them bring.
COmmaunded were the multitude an Image to adore: Sidrach, Misach, Abednago, would not to die therfore.
Into an ouen then were they cast, aliue with one they walkt: The King it saw and cald them out, and with them fréendly talkt.
DReam did the King another dream, whiche Daniel did expound: How that the King for his great pride, as Oxe should féed on ground.
And that seuen yéeres, the whiche he did, and after ruled again: Confessing God to haue the might, and he alone to reign.
EUen as before a prideful Prince, came now again in place: Who proudly drank in holy place, and saw before his face, hand did write vpon a wall, whiche Daniel tolde ful plain: The Medies and the Persians shoule rule when he was slain.
FUl mightie power had Daniel tho, the Princes did him hate: In Lions den they got him cast, but nought by it they gat: He was preserued, they were deuourd, their families and all.
GRreat beast{is} were séen in number foure of Daniel in his bed: By vision he this sight did sée, whiche troubled sore his head.
Foure Monarchies these beast{is} did shew their hornes were kingdomes ten: In latter dayes God by his sonne, he should destroy them then.
HE now dooth sée a mightie Ram, whose force none could resist: But with his hornes he ruled all, and did euen what him list.
The Medies and the Persians they were the Ram so whot: The Grecian power did them destroy compared to a Gote.
IN this place Daniel dooth desire, that that whiche Ieremy said: Might be fulfild and then confesse his sin he did and prayd.
The prayer is heard, the seuentie wéeks the Angel did expound: The Cittie is built, and Christe is born, to them that did him wound.
KIng Cirus ruling Persia the third yéer of his reign, man clothed in linnen white, appéerd to him again, And tolde him things that were to come, at whiche he was abasht: But that Gods Angel made him strong, his countenance had dasht.
LIke as before so now again, of Kings to him is tolde: The Persian power, the might of Greece and eke of Egipt bolde: Of Siria as some suppose, and last of Romaines might.
These kingdomes all not one to faile, against the Churche should fight.
MIchael then that mightie Prince, shall stand for to defend, The Churche of Christe the general day the troubles quite shall end, Wherin to blisse some shall arise, and some to bitter pain: Some shall their fault{is} amend before, and some in sin remain.
¶Daniel now his minde hath said, as God to him did tel: His sight he had in things to come, all others did excel.
The Iewes that in captiuitie, in Caldey land did dwel: He them reueald with ioyful speeche, deep sorowes to expel.
Hosea he dooth followe next, who then did prophesie: VVhen Israel quite from their King, Rehoboam did flie.
He tolde them of their seruice vain, in Bethel vnto calues: How vain it was vnto suche Gods, to seek for helthful salues.
Three score and ten they were his yeeres to ten tribes that he preacht: Say what he could they mended not, they scorned that he teacht.
The vengeance due for sinful life, he vouched to be sure: And mixt among Gods mercies great, by it them to allure.
To worship God as law did wil, set out by him aboue: And leauing all their owne intents, so should they haue his loue.
Harlot he is wild to wed, of whom he sonnes begat: The whorishe life of Israel is signified by that.
The Gentiles should be called in, Gods people for to be: And all the tribes should ioyne in one, and louingly agrée.
GEcause with Ball they did commit moste filthy whordome, so, The Prophet them dooth threat for it, God foorth their filth to shew.
Except that they repent and mend: whiche if they doo, that then As spoused wife moste husband like, he would them looue as when, The iii. Chapiter.
CAst of (he saith) the Iewes should be as drunk with Gods ful vain: To take a harlot he is wild, to shew the thing again.
That King or préest they should not haue and that for many dayes: And yet at le~gth Christ should them saue to whom they should giue praise.
DEclare he dooth how sin did reign, and none mislikte the same: Bothe Princes, people, and the préest{is} in sinning had no shame.
Wherfore he threat{is} that God wil strike and punishe them therfore.
So that to Idols sacrifice, they should doo so no more.
EFtsoones the sinnes he dooth tel out, of Israel by name: From moste to least they mended not, to God their liues to frame.
God should they séek, then would he not of them again be found: Of other power for ayd they should, and so them selues confound.
FUl fast to God they did then hie, repenting of their il: So knowledge they should haue to that God to them did wil.
The Prophets spared not to cut, their sin with woords so sharp: The préest{is} to steale by one consent, no other thing they carp.
GOne all affray the people were their King they did disceiue: As Bakers ouen so burned they, in sin to whiche they cleaue.
Their trust they had in Egipt help, shall not them help in déed: They turned them but not aright when that they were in néed.
HOw they a King and rulers eke, did chuse but not by God: And Idols vain did cleaue vnto, whiche he had them forbod.
For whiche their sin he wil them pay to teache them to offend: With fier their Cittie shalbe burnt· to Egipt shall they wend.
IN leading of an whorishe life, an hunger shall they haue: They said the Prophet was a fool, the spirituall men did raue.
Their wombs and brest{is} should dried their children long not liue: And for a pray vnto their foes, he would them also giue.
KIng ouer them they should haue none their Idols should be stroyd Bothe Iuda and Samaria they should be sore anoyd.
To plough and reap in righteousnes and mercy they are wild: If not betime in the morning, their King he should be kild.
LOuingly from Egipt land, he saith that he them led: And cherisht them with food therto, and gaue them heauenly bread.
Ful lothe he is to punishe them, though it they doo deserue: Thou Ephraim misvsde it self, yet Iuda did not swarue.
MUche crookednes did Ephraim vse, with Iuda dooth he talke: As Iacob liu'de and pleased God, so would he haue them walke.
In tabernacles they should dwel, as in their solemne feast{is}: Because they serued not their God, nor did regard his heast{is}.
NO end they made of woorshipping their Idols and their calues: Yet God their God remayneth God, none els for sin hath salues.
Yet Lion like he wil them vse, but so as for a time, The death of death he saith to be, and bring them down that clime.
OF Israels return he telth, how forren power they leaue: They doo confesse they did transgresse, now vnto God they cleaue.
Who wil the~ blesse make them growe, whose braunches shall so shed: That others shall return by them, and lack the life they led.
¶Hoseas heer hath tolde his minde, a Prophet ful of zeale: And Ioel now beginth to speak, Gods counsel to reueale.
Famine he dooth tel to come, their frute for to destroy: He wilth ye dru~kards for to mourn, their throtes should be ful dry.
Their wine, their oyle, their wheat and corn should be destroyd wt blasting: Therfore he wilth them to proclaim, a common prayer and fasting.
BEholde a power shall come on them, to ruine and to waste: Therfore to turn and to repent, he willeth them make haste.
And then the Lord to them wil turn, and blesse them in his looue: Their sonnes daughters shal haue gift{is} signes shalbe from aboue.
COntrole he wil the enemies, that had destroyd his land: And serue them so as they had doon, when they had them in hand.
Let Iuda now make spear and shéeld, let Gentiles quake and fear: The Lord him self wil pitche the field, Hierusalem to chéer.
¶Thus Ioels tale is finished, three Chapters ful of lore: Now Amos dooth asmuche contain, and twice so many more.
AMos hée did Prophecy, in Ieroboams dayes Damascus and the Philistins shall perishe as he sayes· Tirus and Idumea the like shalbe their lot: And Ammon for his crueltie, whiche was the sonne of Lot
BEcause of Moabs crueltie, against the Edomites Bothe he and Iuda for their fact{is} shall sée ful woful sights.
The Israelites for careles spoile, shall flée before their foes: What woorks for them the Lord had wrought he bréefly to them showes.
CAn any thing be wrought or doon, but God dooth woork the same? His Prophets that doo prophecy, they doo it in his name.
That Israel shalbe destroyd, by Egipt God dooth tel: Samaria and Bethel eke, shall haue their fée as wel.
DOwn wil he throw their rulers eke, for spoyling of the poore: They thought by outward holines, to scape so sharp a shoure.
By famin and great scarsitie, by pestilence and swoord, He punisht them: it would not serue, to bring them to his woord.
EUil hap should fall on Israel for them he dooth lament: Leaue of from wrong he willeth them, with spéed for to repent.
It wil not serue their sacrifice, ne burning of incence: When Iudgeme~t runnes as water flud he wil with them dispence.
FUl plesantly their Princes liu'de, deliting all in ease: With meat and drink and melody, thus they them selues did please.
Therfore the Lord did swear their end, they trusted in their strength: As captiue men they should be led therfore away at length.
GIue signes he dooth by Grashoppers, by fire and lined wall· That God would stroy the Israelites and ouerthrowe them all.
Amaziah vnto the King, of Amos did complain, And him rebukte, but he him tolde what therby he should gain.
HE yet again dooth tel the heads, how they the poor oppresse: And vsed shameful robbery, in making measures lesse· For whiche they should be ouer run, and perishe with the swoord: famine he would send on them, the wanting of his woord.
IF all the wayes they séek they can, yet shall they not put by: But bothe the temple and them selues, he wil them bothe destroy.
Yet wil he fift as in a his chosen from the rest And home they shall return again, and liue in quiet rest.
¶This Shepheard he hath tolde his minde, that came from keeping sheep· Now Obadiah dooth come in, to comfort them that weep.
Prophecy he dooth declare, against the Edomites For vexing of their Uncles kin, in their malitious spices.
And when that they destroyed be, for hurting Iacob so: Then shall the Churche ful quiet be, and rid from all their wo.
¶So dooth this Prophet end his woords, more speeche he dooth not vse: Now Ionas you shall hear to tel, to Niniuie her newes.
AS God him bad he would not doo, but fled another way: In ship, a tempest did arise they cast him in the sea.
In dooing so they pardon axt, a Whale did him deuoure: Thrée dayes and night{is} the fishes womb was vnto him a boure.
BEing thus of the fishe possest, his prayer he did make: Protesting suche as followe lies, Gods mercies they forsake.
But Ionas saith that he wil pay the vowes he took in hand: As God did wil, so did the Whale this Prophet cast on land.
COmmaunded was he once again, to Niniuie to shew: In fortie dayes they mending not, God would them ouerthrowe.
fasting then proclaymed was, the King and they repented: For mending of their former life, God stayd that was inuented.
DIspleased greatly Ionas was, that Niniuie was sparde: Without the Cittie in a boothe, ther angerly he farde.
gourd sprang vp and shaded him, that it decayd he chod: For Niniuee he cared lesse, so is he tolde of God.
¶Heer Ionas book is finished, in chapters foure set out: Now Michah shall appeer to you, the same we go about.
AS God him bad he spareth not but plainly dooth he tel: That down should go the kingdoms bothe of Iuda and Israel
This was the cause Idolatrie, that foully they did vse.
For whiche the power of forren folke, should them and theirs abuse.
BEcause the mightie men did spoile, the poor of house and féeld: He telleth them God would them plagin their foes should make them yéeld.
They wantonly did mock and skorne, the preachers that did preache: He that of wine would preache to them, he be of all did teache.
CRy out he dooth against the heds, that did the people spoile And sayth their cry it should be heard, when they should haue the foile.
Their Prophets did for money preache, the rulers built in blood: Their glorious state shuld therfore down in Gods displeasing mood.
DEuine he dooth that Christe his Churche shall floorishe ouer all: And that far of to serue the Lord, one shall another call.
Their worldly cares warlike minde, shall quite be laid aside: Though some conspire their ouerthrow, it shall not so betide.
ERe that they should attain this peace, muche troubles should they haue: Hierusalem with all her power, her self shée should not saue.
But Bethlehem Ephraita that little was in sight, Captain foorth should bring to them, of endles power and might.
FOr them what God had doon he telth, therby them to prouoke, That righteousnes they might embrace, and were an humble yoke.
False weight{is} mesures they did vse, the people to deceiue: Therfore the poyson of their frutes, with labour lost should leaue.
GReatly now dooth he mourn, because so few did fear the Lord: No trust in fréend could then be found, their liues were to vntoward.
But yet he wilth the foes to stop, to rage against his flock: Affirming God to kéep his graunt, to Abram and his stock.
¶The minde of Michah you haue heard, a tale ful plain he tolde: Now Nahum speaks to Niniuie, a Prophet sharp and bolde.
ALmightie Lord is God in déed, his power it passeth all: All loftie things he can destroy, and kéep his fréends from thrall.
The wicked shall consumed be, that Iuda did molest: So should their feast{is} be kept again, and they should liue in rest.
BEholde as Iacob was destroyd, so should th' Assirian power: The Caldies should with force might, their land and them deuour.
Their Quéen as captiue should be led, their treasures quite bereft: Their mightie men so Lionlike, to them should not be left.
CAst down God wil the Niniuites that owed so in pride: The glory that that Cittie had, it should be set aside· Their multitude should not them help, nor mighty men them ayd: Their Cittie burnt, their land destroyd the wrath should not be stayd.
¶VVhat Nahum said to Niniuie, to you hath been exprest: Now Abacuck his Prophecy, it com'th among the rest.
ALl wickednes did flowe at no sinful life did want: The law put by and righteousnes, among them then was
Because the godly went to wrack, the Caldeys God would raise: To teache them fishe as fishers doo, and make of them their prayes.
BE bolde of this ye prideful men your pride shall come ful lowe: But righteous men by faith shall liue, your fall the world shall knowe.
The couetous and blooddy men, the drunkards in his fre, The Idoll and the worshipper, shalbe consumde with fire.
CAll vnto God the Prophet dooth, and for his Churche dooth pray: Describing God his maiestie, in power to passe for ay. Beséeching him his foes to strike, with mercy to correct His chosen flock, and thus he ends, his book to muche effect.
¶Thus Abacuck hath tolde his tale, ful boldely to the Iewes: And Sophoniah commeth next, to tel them the same newes.
ALl liuing things the Lord wil stroy, with man for his offence: And Iuda and Hierusalem should haue their recompence.
woful ruine wil he make, for halting in their faith: Their strength, their goods, shuld not the~ help but perishe they should he saith The ii. Chapiter.
BEfore his wrath doo come in déed, he wilth them to repent: The kingdomes of the Philistines for sin it should be rent.
The Moabites the Ammonites for ioying Israels fall, With Morians and Niniuites should be destroyed all.
COrrupted were the Iudges all, the préest{is} and Prophets vain: Not one would mend what so was said, nor turn to God again.
The Gentiles shall conuerted be, the remnant of his flock Shall turn again and liue in peace, and be a faithful stock.
¶Sophoniah thus he hath said, as God did wil him speak: Now Haggay with his mouth vnclosde, his minde to you shall break.
ALl hope was past for to return, from Babilon again: God plagued them al their frutes their labours were in vain.
He found great fault they builded so, and that his house was down: And willed them with spéed to build his temple and his town.
BEholde the glory of the house, whiche Salomon did build, Should not be like to this (he saith) nor no suche beautie yéeld.
God wil them blesse with plenteousnes if they wil patient bée: Their foes shall fall but they shall reign and come to hie degrée.
¶Haggay hath tolde his tale, and made the people glad: Zachariah ye shall haue next, as yee the rest haue had.
AGain to God if they would turn· he would turn vnto them: Or els as to their forefathers, so would he doo to them.
Hierusalem shalbe new built, by vision it is tolde: The careles heathen shalbe shent, for wasting of his folde.
BE bolde of this, the temple shall be built again in déed: An Angel did the same declare, and that they should not dréed.
For God would be their ful defence, and vnto them a wall, And bring their foes to be their pray, no power withstand them shall.
COrrected was Sathan the Deuil, that would the woork haue let: And Iehosuah that was hie Préest was specially out set.
His filthy clothes were made ful fair, if he wil walke aright: The multitude shall him obay, and haue in him delight.
DEclare on foorth the Angell dooth, by vision ful plain: Hierusalem in goodly wise, should be set vp again.
Who should it build how foes should sin, and fréends should somewhat faint But God his woork should fortifie by Christe his holy saint.
EUil hap and curse shall fall on these, the swearer and the théef: flying book shall them consume, and theirs for their mischéef.
As Iuda had afflicted béen, in Babel for their gilt: So Babel now like smart should haue, and vtterly be spilt.
FOure Monarchies by charets he dooth describe to come, As sent from God to rule the world, by whom it should be wun.
The hie préest had his golden crownes, Iehosua by name: And he the building should set out and win a fame.
GOd dooth their fasting disalow, their mourning was in vain· They eat and drank vnto them selues, they stil did gape for gain.
When he did call they would not hear, his statutes to obay: They shall cry out but he shall turn, his ear from them away.
HE wil restore them home again, and stay his wrathful rage: They shall ful long there rest in peace, enioying for age, Deceit and wrong they must forsake, forswearing eke defie: The Gentiles shall their lore wel like, and thervnto apply.
IN wrathful mood for all their pride, he wil the Gentiles waste: Bothe Tire and Zidon in their welth, he wil them ouer cast.
But sure his churche he wil defend, by Christe his sonne so méek: lowely sitting on an Asse· yet shall they to hym séek.
KNowe héer you may what Idols be, soothsayers foolishe art: To Iuda he wil fréendly be, and fully take their part.
To Ephraim he wil fauour shew, and giue to them suche might: That forren power they shall not fear but shall put them to flight.
LOwe wil he bring them in his wrath, bothe shepheards and their shéep, Because they had no more respect his statutes for to kéep.
The shepheards wagis it is paid, and thirtie péeces tolde: The potter had it giuen to him, so was our master solde.
MEruaylously the Lord wil for Iuda in his power: Hierusalem shall plagued be, her foes shall it deuour.
Yet shall they bothe great fauour finde, and come to happy cace: Their foes shall faint but they shall ioy, and finde a resting place.
NO more wil God think on their sin, their Idols shall away: Their Prophets false they wil destroy, their parents shall them pay: The shepheard should so stricken be, that scatter should the shéep.
The people then to God shall flée, ful wel he wil them kéep.
Muche people shall to her resorte, the way it shalbe plain.
The moste of them that hated her, consumde shalbe and slain: And those that come not to her feast, shall want their yéerly reign.
¶Thus Zachary is finished, novv Malachy shall speak: The last he is that to the Ievves, the minde of God did break.
He and the tvvo that spake before, the Ievves did comfort giue: VVhen they thought least then home to go in peace and rest to liue.
Til Iohn did come that did Baptize, no Prophet did appeer: This Prophets speaks vnto the Preests, his vvoords novv let vs hear.
Louing minde to Israel alwayes the Lord did And yet both they eke their préest{is} they had of him no fear.
The aulter and his table bothe, they past not to abuse: Polluted things they offer did, on gain their hart{is} did muse.
BEcause they did their office il, their blessing he wil curse: Their parent first did not so wel, but they did mickle wurse.
Their mariages they were amisse, their hart was not aright: Therfore despisde, God let them be and that in eche mans sight.
COme spéedely shall Christe in déed but Iohn shall come before: And wrongful life shall passe away, God shall good life restore.
The prosperous state of wicked men, did somewhat them molest: But at the length they should wel sée that God did them detest.
DOutles the day shall come (saith hée) that God the proud wil burn: But saue he wil the faithful men, whiche vnto him do turn.
Eliah he shall come before, Iohn Baptist it dooth mean: Who shall the sonnes and fathers teach their hart{is} for to be clean.
¶The Prophets thus are finished, and books Canonicall: Apocripha ye shall haue next, if death doo not me call.

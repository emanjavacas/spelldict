a letter sent to the speaker of the parliament of england from the three generals of the english navy touching the last great and bloudy engagement between the two fleets of england and holland

sir

the instant in the morning being some five leagues distant from the english shore we discryed the dutch fleet early in the morning consisting as we then judged are since informed by some of their own number of
all men of war and some merchant men a league and an half to windward of the weathermost of our ships and of most of the fleet two or three leagues

the ship triumph with the fairfax speaker and about more being nearest unto them the dutch admiral might probably if he had pleased to have kept the wind gone away with his whole fleet and we had not

been able to have reached him with our main body onely with a few frigots our best saylors which had not been likely to have done very much upon them but the said admiral so soon as he had discovered us put all his merchant men to windward and ordered them to stay there as some that we have taken have since informed us and himself with his body of men of war drew down upon us that were the weathermost ships where we were in a short time engaged and by reason the greatest part of our ships were to and much a stern those that were weathermost had a very sharp conflict of it that whole day till about a clock in the afternoon by which time a considerable number of our ships and frigots had got so far a head that by tacking they could weather the greatest part of the dutch fleet which so soon as the dutch admiral perceived he tacked likewise and those with him and left us we spent the remainder of that day and night to man our selves out of the weaker ships and to repair our rigging masts and sails without which we were not in a capacity to move in the sea
we took and destroyed in this day or men of war

they had possession of captain barker in the prosperous captain bourn in the assistance the oak and some other ships but blessed be god we repossest them again with the losse of some in the assistance
the leewardmost part of our ships continued fighting till night separated being engaged within two hours as soon as wee we lost the sampson whereof captain button was commander which was so much torn and unserviceable the captain and many more wounded and slain that we took out the men that were left and let her sink into the sea
at night the dutch fleet and we kept as near one another as we could conveniently without mixing

each of us having our lights abroad all night the wind westernly and little wind they steered directly up the channel their merchant men a head and men of war in the rear we were in the morning some three or four leagues to the southward of the isle of wight as soon as it was day we made what sail we could after them but being calm could not get up until noon and our main body not until two of the clock by which time we drew very near each other and had warm work while night parted us we took and destroyed this day some five sail of men of war the dutch fleet steered up the channel with their lights abroad wee followed the wind at a fine little gale all night

the day about a clock in the morning we fell close in with them with some great ships and all the frigots of strength though very many others could not come up that day and seeing their men of war somewhat weakned we sent smaller frigots and ships of lesse force that could get up amongst their which put their whole body to a very great trouble that many of them and their men of war began to break off from their main body and towards the evening we pressed so hard upon them that they turned their merchant men out of their fleet upon us as is conceived for a bait we gave strict order that none of our ships that could get up to their men of war and had force should meddle with any merchant men but leave them to the rear we continued still fighting with them untill the dusk of the evening by which time we were some leagues and a half of blacknesse in france the wind at we steering directly for the point of land having the wind of the dutch fleet so that if it had pleased the lord in his wise providence who sets bounds to the sea and the waies and actions of men it had been but one hours

longer to night we had probably made an interposition between them and home whereby they might have been to have made their way through us with their men of war which at this time were not above as we could count the rest being destroyed or dispersed the merchant men also must have been necessitated to run ashore or fallen into our hands which as we conceive the dutch admiral being sensible of just as it was dark bore directly in upon the shore where as it is supposed he anchored the tide of ebb being then come which was a leewardly tide we consulted with our pilots and men knowing those coasts and parts what it was possible for them to do whose opinions were that he could not weather the french shore as the tide the wind was then to get home and that we must likewise anchor or we could not be able to carry it about the flats of soam whereupon we anchored blacknesse being and by three leagues from us

this night being very dark and blowed hard the dutch got away from us so that in the morning we could not discover one ship more then our own which were betwixt and the rest being scattered and as many prizes as made up in all we spent all this night and day while a clock in fitting of our ships masts and sails for we were not capable to stir till they were repaied at which time being a windward tide and the dutch fleet gone we weighed and stood over to the english shore fearing to stay longer upon the coast being a lee shore
the day in the morning we were fair by the isle of wight being the place whereunto we then thought fit to repair for accommodation but the wind blew so hard nouthwardly we could not get in that day

the day we weighed and got near the st ellens

road and sent for all the captains on board to understand the state of the fleet but it blowing hard we could not accomplish it onely we commanded all the ships that were disabled to turn into stokes bay and the rest remained about us

the day we sent for all the captains on board of this ship and ordered out squadrons one to ply to the eastward the other to the westward of the isle of wight
the last of which sailed yesterday being the present
it hath blown so hard that we have scarce been able to send our boats one from the other or do any thing till this day that we got up to this place
thus you see how it hath pleased the lord to deal with us poor unworthy instruments imployed in this late transaction wherein he hath delivered into our hands some or of their ships of war which have been by your fleet without the losse of any one ship save the sampson taken and destroyed besides merchantmen whose number we know not they being scattered to several ports
we have many men wounded and divers both of honesty and worth slain

postscript starts here several of the dutch are driven a shore in france one without any men at all in her
six merchant ships are brought prize into foy in cornwal
a list of prizes are already brought into the
the parl ordered a letter to be written to the generals and commanders with the parliaments resentment of their great and faithful service in the late engagement with the dutch

on the of this instant march we received further advertisements that sir john evarson one of the dutch admirals was slain in the late ingagement and that de ruttier is sore wounded most of the fleet that got off to calice road are extreamly rent and torn both in their masts sails rigging which the high states hearing of forthwith set out their placaert or declaration throughout all the cinqueports in the united provinces expresly charging and prohibiting all captains masters and other officers of all and every respective ship or vessel not to depart upon pain of death without licence from the general councel and thereupon immediately dispatched a messenger to de witte requiring him not to go forth to sea with his fleet without special orders from the states general so that as yet he lies in the tazel

they talk high that the treaty between holland and denmark is concluded and that a treaty is driven on in france for a league also wherein the interest of the king of scots will likewise be included which pleaseth the orenge party highly for indeed they were alwaies very active to have him personally in the netherlands and are now in hopes to prevail with the province of holland to unite in this chimical design because the chief obstructer thereof the lord paw is now dead

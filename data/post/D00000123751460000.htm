reader

here protest before the searcher of all hearts that have no end either of faction or relation in this ensuing treatise
am no papist no sectary but a true lover of reformation and peace my pen declines all bitternesse of spirit all deceitfulnesse of heart and may safely in this particular with saint paul say speak the truth in christ and lye not my conscience bearing me witnesse in the holy ghost that neither walk nor write in craftinesse nor handle the holy scriptures deceitfully therefore if thy cause be iesus christ in the name of iesus christ adjure thee to lay aside all wilfull ignorance all prejudice all private respects and interests and all uncharitable censures deale faithfully with thy soule and suffer wholesome admonitions search the severall scriptures herein contained and where they open a gate climbe not thou over a stile consult with reason herein exercised and where it finds a mouth find thou an eare and let truth prosper though thou perish and let god be glorified although in thy confusion

the loyall convert
the kingdome of england that hath for many ages continued the happiest nation on the habitable earth enjoying the highest blessings that heaven can give or earth receive the fruition of the gospell which setled a firme peace which peace occasioned a full plenty under the gracious government of wise and famous princes over a thriving and people insomuch that shee became the earths paradise and the worlds wonder is now the nursery of all sects her peace is violated her plenty wasting her government distempered her people discontented and unnaturally imbroyld in her own blood not knowing the way nor affecting the meanes to peace insomuch that she is now become the of the earth and the of nations
the cause and ground of these our nationall combustions are these our nationall transgressions which unnaturally sprung from the neglect of that truth we once had and from the abuse of that peace wee now want which taking occasion of some differences betwixt his majestie and his two houses of parliament hath divided our kingdome within it selfe which had so divided it selfe from that god who blest it with so firme a truth so setled a peace and so sweet an vnity
as that sinne brought this division so this division sharpned with mutuall jealousies brought in the sword
when the lyon roares who trembles not and when iudgements thunder who is not troubled among the rest who brought some faggots to this combustion stood astonisht and amazed to whom the mischiefe was farre more manifest then the remedy at last laid my hand upon my heart and concluded it was the hand of god where being plundered in my understanding began to make a scrutiny where the first breach was made that let in all these miseries
found the whole kingdome now contracted into a parliament which consisted of three estates a king a house of peeres and a house of commons by the wisdome and vnity whereof all things conduceable to the were be advised upon presented and established
found this vnity disjoynted and growne to variance even to blood the king and his adherents on the party and his two houses and their adherents on the other

the pretence of this division was the true protestant religion which both protested to maintaine the liberty of the subject which both protested to preserve the priviledges of parliament which both promise to protect yet neverthelesse the first never profaned the second never more interrupted the third never more violated

standing amazed at this riddle turned mine eyes upon his majesty and there viewed the lords annointed sworne to maintain the established lawes of this kingdome turned mine eyes upon the two houses and in them beheld the interest of my country sworne to obey his majesty as their supreame governour
heard a remonstrance cryed from the two houses read it approved it inclined unto it a declaration from his majestie read it applauded it adhered to the justnesse of it the parliaments answer turned to the parliament his majesties reply returned to his majestie
thus tost and turned as a to my own weaknesse resolved it impossible to serve two masters
fled to reason reason could not satisfie me fled to policie policy could not resolve me at length finding no councellour but that which first should have sought hyed me to the booke of god as the great oracle and ushering my inquest with prayer and humiliation opened the sacred leaves which not by chance presented to my first eye the
of the proverbs
the feare of a king is as the roaring of a lyon and who so provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soule
now began to search and found as many places to that purpose as would swell this sheet into a volume so that in a very short space was so furnished with such strict precepts backt with such strong examples that my iudgement was enlightned and my wavering conscience so throughly convinced that by the grace of that power which directed me neither feare nor any shall ever hereafter remove me unlesse some clearer light direct me
but above all the rest a precept and an example out of the old testament strongly confirmed by a precept and an example out of the new setled my opinion and established my resolution

the first precept

out of the old ieremy

where it pleased god to own nebuchadnezzar his servant although a knowne pagan a profest idolater and a fierce persecutor of all gods children concerning whom he saith
they that serve not the king of babylon and that will not put their necks under his yoake will punish them with the sword famine and the pestilence till have consumed them
verse
therefore

hearken not to your diviners and prophets that say unto you you shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophecie a lye unto you
but the nations that shall serve the king of babylon and bring their necks under his yoake those will let remaine in their own land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein

can there be a stricter precept or could there be a more impious prince and yet this precept and yet this prince must be obeyed nay sub poena too upon the paine of gods high wrath fully exprest in famine sword and pestilence not only upon the people but upon the priests also that shall perswade them unto disobedience

the second precept

is enjoyned us out of the new testament rom

let every soule be subject to the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation
this power this king to whom paul commandeth this subjection was nero the bloudy persecuter of all that honoured the blessed name of iesus christ

gods command should bee a sufficient argument undefined span alphabet is enough but when he addes a reason too he answers all objections but when he threatens a punishment no lesse then damnation upon the resistance thereof he hath used all meanes to perswade a necessity of obedience
let every soule be subject
not equall much lesse superiour
and what is taking up of armes but an implyed supposition of at least equality what are the hopes of conquest but an ambition of superiority what is condemning judging or deposing but supremacie for it is against the nature of an inferiour to condemne judge or depose a superiour
and lest the rebellious should confine his obedience to a good prince the next words reply for there is no power but of god
power in it selfe is neither good nor evill but as it is in subjecto the person if an evill king an evill power if a good king a good power god sends the one in mercy and we must be subject the other in judgement and we must be subject in things lawfull actively in things unlawfull passively if a good king he must have our praise and our plyance if an evill king he must have our prayers and our patience
he that resists the power whether good or evill for all power is of god resists an ordinance of god ordinances of men are not resisted without ruine and whosoever resisteth shall receive but what undefined span alphabet damnation to themselves

now compare this place with that cor

hee that shall eate this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily eateth and drinketh what undefined span alphabet damnation to himselfe

if then there be proportion betwixt the sin and the punishment you may hereby gather the heynousnesse of disobedience the punishment whereof is the very same with his that is guilty of the body and blood of our lord to the for not discerning the lords body to the other for not discerning the lords annointed

the lords annointed

and who is he none but the regenerate christ is not christ to any to whom jesus is not iesus

gods word answers your silly objection

not was not saul gods annointed

was not cyrus gods annointed and many more whom god acknowledges so and yet wicked kings

cyrus is mine annointed yet he hath not knowne me

the first example

for our obedience the old testament proposes to our imitation

dan


nebuchadnezzar the king of babilon sets up a golden image shadrech meshach and abednego were commanded to fall down and worship it

the king a known pagan commands a grosse idolatry did these men conspire or being rulers of the province of babel did they invite the jewes into a rebellion did these to strengthen their own faction blast their soveraigns name with tyrannie and paganisme did they endeavour by scandals and impious aspersions to render him odious to his people did they encourage their provinces to take up armes for the defence of their liberties or religion did they seize upon or stop his revenues or annihilate his power did they estrange themselves from his presence murther his messengers or would they have sleighted his gracious offers no being called by their prince they came and being commanded to give actuall obedience to his unlawfull commands observe the modesty of their first answer we are not carefull to answer thee in this matter

and being urged mark their pious resolution in the second be it knowne king we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image thou hast set up

the king threatens the fornace they yeeld their bodies to the fornace and say

god whom we serve will deliver us out of thy hands and not hee will deliver thee into our hands
they expect deliverance rather in their passive obedience then in their actuall resistance

but they were few in number

and their forces not considerable

admit that

which all histories deny
was not god as able to subdue him with so few as to deliver them from so many had their weaknesse

lesse reason for the cause of gods apparent dishonour to expect a miraculous assistance in those dayes of frequent miracles then we after so long a cessation of miracles gods glory will not be vindicated by unlawfull meanes or unwarrantable proceedings



but we take up armes not against the king but against his evill counsellors

adherents ye meane

a rare distinction and tell me whose power hath his adherents the kings
by which appeares ye take up armes against the kings power he that resisteth the power it is not said the prince shall receive damnation

againe where the word of a king is there is power god joyned the king and his power and who dare separate them they that take up armes against the parliaments power you say take up armes against the parliament doe not they then that take up armes against the kings power by the same reason take up arms against the king now look back upon your intricate distinction and blush

but

if the king betray the trust reposed in him by his subjects they may suspend their obedience and resist him

kings are gods vicegerents

and cannot be compelled to give an accompt to any

but to god against thee against thee onely have sinned that is to thee to thee only must give accompt
though have sinned against vriah by my act and against my people by my example yet against thee have onely sinned
you cannot deprive or limit them in what you never gave them
god gave them their power and who art thou that darest resist it

by me kings raigne

but

his crowne was set up upon his head by his subjects upon such and such conditions

why was the penalty

upon the faile not expressed then coronation is but a humane ceremony
and was hee not proclaimed before hee was crowned proclaimed but what a king and did not you at the same instant by relative consequence proclaim your selves subjects and shall subjects condition with their king or will kings bind themselves to their subjects upon the forfeiture of their power after they have received their regall authority

but

the king hath by writ given his power to his parliament and therefore what they doe they doe by vertue of his power

the king

by his writ gives not away his power but communicates it
by the vertue of which writ they are called ad tractandum consulendum de arduis regni to treat and advise concerning the difficulties of the kingdom here is all the power the writ gives them and where they exceed they usurp the kings power being both against the law of god and the constitutions of the kingdom

well

but in case of necessity when religion and liberty lies at the the constitutions of the kingdom for the preservation of the kingdome may suffer a dispensation

admit that

but what necessity may dispence with the violation of the law of god the deviation wherefrom is evill and thou shalt doe no evill that good may come thereon

but

we take no armes against the king but onely to bring delinlinquents to condigne punishment

and

who are they even those that take up arms for the kings which an unrepealed statute
hen
acquites
but admit statutes may be broken and you seek to punish them who gave you the power so to doe the law and what law denies the king power to pardon delinquents god that hath put power into the hand of majesty hath likewise planted mercy in the heart of soveraignty and will ye take away both his birthright and his blessing also take heed you doe not slight that which one day may prove your sanctuary

but

the king being a mixt monarch is bound to his own lawes

there be two sorts of lawes

directive and coercive as to the first he is only bound to make his accompt to god so to the second he is onely liable to the hand of god

who shall say unto him what doest thou

but

kings now a dayes have not so absolute a power as the kings mentioned in the scripture

who limited it

god or man man could not limit the power he never gave if god shew me where till then this objection is frivolous

but

when kings and their assistants make an affensive and a destructive warre against their parliaments may they not then take up defensive armes

it is no offensive war for a king to endeavour the recovery of his surrepted right

however

are not the members of a parliament subjects to their soveraign if not what are they if subjects ought they not to be subject gods people the iewes that were to be destroyed by the kings command neither did nor durst make a defensive war against his abused power untill they first obtained the kings consent

but admit it lawfull though neither granted nor warranted that subjects may upon such tearmes make a defensive war does it not quite crosse the nature of a defensive war to assaile pursue and dispossesse you shot peeces of ordnance before one was returned at edgehill was that defensive when you besieged redding which you after slighted was that defensive when ye affronted was that defensive

the warrantable weapons against an angry king are exhortation disswasion wise reproof by such are nearest to him petition prayer and flight all other weapons will at last wound them that use them

the second example

was lest us out of the new testament by him that is the true president of holy obedience our blessed saviour

whose humility and sufferance was set before us as a copy for all generations to practice by

the temporall kingdom of the jewes successively usurpt by those two heathen princes augustus and tiberius two contemporaries was his naturall descended from his tipe and ancestour king david
had not he as great an interst in that crowne as wee have in this was not hee as tender eyed towards his owne naturall people as we to one another was not the truth as deare to him who was the very truth and the way to it as direct to him that was the onely way as to us was not he the great reformer
had the sword been a necessary stickler in reformation how hapned it that he mistook his weapon so instead of a trumpet hee lifted up his voice

was plots policies propositions prophanations plunderings military preparations his way to reformation were they not his own words he that taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword

nor was it want of strength that he reformed not in a martiall way could not hee command more then twelve legions of angels

or had he pleased to use the arme of flesh could not hee that raised the dead raise a considerable army sure iohn the baptist would have ventured his head upon a fairer quarrell and peter drawn his sword to a bloodier end no question but paul the twelve apostles and disciples would have proved as tough colonels as your associated essex priests did captaines and doubtlesse peter who converted
in one day would have raised a strong army in six
our blessed saviour well knew that caesar came not thither without divine permission in respect whereof he became obedient to the very shadow of a king and whom he actively resisted not he passively obeyed



but there was a necessity of his obedience and subjection to make him capable of a shamefull death

no

his obedience as well death was voluntary which makes you guilty of a shamefull argument

but

he was a single person we a representative body what is unexpedient in the one is lawfull in the other

worse and worse if our blessed saviour be not pepresentative tell me whereof art thou a member woe be that body politicke which endeavours not to be conformed according to the head mysticall

he preacht peace your martiall ministers by what authority they best know proclaime warre he obedience they sedition he truth they lyes he order they confusion he blessednesse to the peacemakers they courage to the persecutors he blessedness to the persecuted they brand them with malignity that call them blessed
god was not heard in the whirlewind but in the still voice
but his thoughts are not as our thoughts neither are our wayes like his wayes
but whence proceeds all this even from a viperous generation which hath long nested in this unhappy island and those encreased multitudes of simple soules seduced by their seeming sanctity who taking advantage of our late too great abuse of ceremonies are turnd desperate enemies to all order and discipline being out of charity with the very lords prayer because it comes within the popish liturgie

how many of these have lately challenged the name of sanctified vessels for conteyning the poyson of unnaturall sedition how many of these have usurpt the stile of for disaffected peace how many of these have counterfeited the honour of good patriots for largely contributing towards the ruines of their country how many does this army consist of how for their sakes is blasphemy connived at sacriledge permitted how for their encouragement are lyes and impudencies invented nay publisht nay published in the very pulpits and tolerated if not commanded even by them who perchance were this quarrell ended would throw the first stone them how many of our learned religious and orthodox divines who by their able tongues and pens have defended and maintained the true ancient and catholique faith and vindicated the reformed religion from the aspersions of her potent adversaries are now plundered in their goods sequestred in their livings imprisoned in their persons if not forced in their consciences whilest their wives and poor children begging their bread are left to the mercy of these unmercifull times even for the encouragement of them whose pedanticke learning durst never shew her ridiculous face before an easie

whose livelyhoods they unworthily usurpe not dispensing the bread of life but the darnell of fancie and sedition abhorring the way to peace and maligning those that ensue it



but we desire peace so we may have truth too

what mean ye by having truth

the preservation of the old truth or the institution of a new

if ye feare the alteration of the old having your soveraignes oath which you dare not beleive what other assurance can you have the blood you shed is certaine the change you feare is uncertaine it is no wisdome to apply a desperate remedy to a suspected disease
if the enjoyment of peace depends upon a full assurance of truth our discords may beare an everlasting date god hath threatned to remove his candlesticke and our wickednesse justly feares it and so long as we feare it shall we abjure peace the blessed meanes to prevent it he that seeks to settle truth by the sword distracts it
or is it a truth ye want if so is it of doctrine or of discipline if of doctrine actum est de nostra religione farewell our religion
or is it of discipline discipline is but a ceremony
and did the lord of the sabboth dispence with a morall law for the preservation of an oxes life or an asses and shall we to alter some few indifferent ceremonies allowed by the parliaments of three pious and wise princes and the practice of many holy martyres who sealed the true protestant religion with their blood cry downe peace and shed the blood of many thousand christians our seduced protestants will have no set formes of prayer but what proceeds immediatly from their own fancies
this is their truth
our will heare our sermons if they like the teacher but no divine service
this is their truth
our separatists will not communicate in our churches nor in our congregations
that is their truth
our auabaptists will not baptize till yeares of discretion and rebaptize
that is their truth
our antinomians will have no repentance
this is their truth
our independants will have an universall parity this their truth
good god when shall we have peace if not till all these truths meet

but

christ sayes come not to bring peace but the sword therefore for the propagation of peace it is lawfull to use the sword

so

he is termed a stumbling blocke and does that warrant us to stumble so

he sayes all you shall be offended because of me and does this patronize our offences the law is good and just because then we had not knowne sin but by the law

is it therefore lawfull for us to sin god forbid

our saviour brings the sword among us as wholesome meat brings sicknesse to a weakely sicke stomack or physick to a body abounding with humours not intentionally but occasionally
thus by your erronious and weak mistakes you make the prince of peace the patron of your unnaturall warre and the god of truth the president of your unexamined errors
but almighty god the champion of his own truth and maintainer of his own cause hath to more then common admiration appeared in this great enterprize
he that delivered israels handfull from the hand of pharaohs host hath shewed himselfe in the almost incredible proceedings of this warre the briefe relation whereof may move those hearts that are not scared or stone to melt into a thankfull acknowledgement of his power and remaine as monuments of his mercy that children yet unborne may say hereafter god was here viz

the two houses of parliament made first a generall seizure of all the armes ammunition castles forts magazines and ships being the whole visible strength of this unhappy kingdome to whom having now setled the militia both by sea and land in their own hands tides of proposition gold came in upon the publicke faith monie like blood from the liver conveyed through all the veines issued to make a large supply and where it stopt awhile mountaines of massie plate from the vast goblet to the slender thimble this faith removed into their safe possession and when the great milch cow began to they prest her nipples and by hard streyning renewd the streame
as physitians evacuate the body sometimes by vomit sometimes by purge sometimes by phlebetomie sometimes by sweating sometimes by sluxing sometimes diuretically yet purge but the same peccant humour so did they first by proposition then by way of contribution now by way of loane then by way of subsidie no lesse then at one time hereby way assessement there by way of twentieth part then by way of excise one while by way of sequestration then by way of plunder but still the issue mony and to work the better upon the affections of the multitude all this for the behoofe of king and

parliament for the pretended defence of god knowes what religion insomuch that men came in like swarmes to the next tree or rather like treacherous decoyes with their innocent multitude into the net and horses without number

thus were they supplyed with all necessaries which the arme of flesh could provide for the waging of an inconquerable warre whereon the money already expended makes no lesse figures then
millions sterl besides the revenues of the king queen prince duke of yorke and the whole estates of all such that take up armes against them besides free quarter and souldiers yet unpayd
his majesty on the other side driven away with a few attendants not having among them so many swords and pistols as these had cannons wanting both mony horses and ammunition onely what hee received from the piety of some beleiving subjects whose eares were against all defamations and scandals cast upon sacred majesty finding slender provision in his own dominions and that stopt or seized which came from forreigne parts no shipping but what he purchast with the precious and extream hazard of his few but valiant subjects no armes but what he gained by the couragious venture of his own neglected life the subject of our continuall prayers
yet hath god covered his head in the day of battaile and blest him with such successe that he is by the divine providence become a great master of the field and almost able to maintain fight with his own ships at sea
the god of heaven blesse him and prosper him and make his dayes as the dayes of heaven that being here the faiths defender he may still bee defended by the object of that faith
nor is the providentiall hand of god more visible in prospering him then in punishing his enemies whose ruines may remain as to us and pyramids of gods power whereof a touch
sir iohn hotham then governour of hull who first defied and dared his soveraigne to his face what is become of him how stands he a marke betwixt two dangers having nothing left him but guilt enough to make him capable of a desperate fortune

master hambden that first waged law and then warre against his own naturall prince hath not he since these unhappy troubles began been first punished with the losse of children nay visited to the third generation to the weakning if not ruining of his family and then with the losse of his own life in the same place where hee first took up armes against his gracious soveraign was it not remarkeable that the

lord brooke who often excepted against that clause in the lyturgie from sudden death good lord deliver us was slaine so suddenly who was so severe an enemy against peace should perish in the same warre he so encouraged who so bitterly inveyed against episcopall government should be shot dead out of a cathedrall church who labouring to put out the left eye of establisht government his left eye and life were both put out together

how is duke hamilton scarce warme in his new honour taken in his own snare having entangled his lord and master in so many inconveniences how is holland whose livelyhood was created by his soveraignes favour branded with a double treachery and like a shittlecocke fallen at the first return and scarce able to raise himselfe by a sorry declaration is not bristoll fines who at his councell of warre condemned and executed innocent blood himselfe condemned pleading innocence at a councell of warre from the mouth of his owne generall though finding perchance more mercy then he either deserved or shewed but that blood that cryed to him for mercy will cry to heaven for vengeance
and are not many more ripe for the same iudgment whose notorious crimes have branded them for their respective punishments how many of those ministers have died expectorating blood whilst others at this time labouring under the same disease can find no art to promise a recovery
all whom leave to possible repentance and passe over
cromwell that profest defacer of churches witnesse peterborough and lincolne and rifeler of the monuments of the dead whose prophane troopers if fame has not forgot to speake a truth waterd their horses at the font and fed them at the holy table that cromwell
sandes whose sacrilegious troopers committed such barbarous insolencies with his at least connivance in the church of canterbury and used such inhumane tortures on the tender brests of women to force confession of their hidden goods the golden subjects of their robbery what can the first expect and what reward the other hath found neither prophecie nor judge
if these and such as they doe fight for the reformed religion god deliver every good man both from them and it cursed be their wrath for it is fierce and their anger for it is cruell

these and of such many are they that whilst they pretend a reformation need first to be reformed

nor do in taxing this army of such impious barbarismes excuse or rather not condemne the other whereof no question too great a number are as equally profane whilst all together make up one body of wickednesse to bring a ruine on this miserable kingdome for whose impieties
his majesty hath so often suffered



but his majesties army besides those looser sorts of people consists of numerous papists the utter enemies of true religion

to whom the king hath sworne his protection

from those hee may require assistance

but unto all his people as well papists as protestants hee hath sworne his protection therefore from all his subjects as well papists as protestants he may require assistance
neither does he call in papists as papists to maintaine religion as himselfe hath alwayes manifested but as subjects to subdue or at least qualifie sedition
the ayde of the subject is either in his person or in his purse both are requireable to the service of a soveraigne
put case his majesty should use the assistance of none but protestants tell me would ye not be apt to cavill that he is favourable to the papists neither willing to endanger their persons nor endammage their purses or at least that they are reserved for a last blow or in case papists should largely underwrite to your propositions send in horses armes or other provisions would you not accept it and for its sake their persons too are you so strict in your preparations as to catechize every souldier or to examine first every officers religion or having the proffer of a good popish or debaucht commander tell me should he be denied his commission remember sir arthur ashton whom his majesty entertaines by your example
these things indifferently considered it will manifestly appeare that the honest minded vulgar are meerly seduced under the colour of piety to be so impious as by poysoning every action of their lawfull prince to foster their implicite rebellion

but in case your side should prosper and prevaile what then would then our miseries be at an end reason tels us no god keeps us from the experience think you that government whether new or

reformed which is set up by the sword must not be maintained by the sword and how can peace and plenty bee consistent with perpetuall garrisons which must bee maintained with a perpetuall charge besides the continuall excursions and injuries committed by souldiers judge you

or put the case this necessary consequence could be avoided think you the ambition of some new accustomed to such arbitrary and necessitated power on the one side and the remaining loyalty of his majesties subjects watching all opportunities to right their injured soveraigne and themselves on the other side would not raise perpetuall tempests in this kingdome or if such an almost unpreventable evill should not ensue think you such swarmes of sectaries sweat for nothing are their purses so apt to bleed to no end will not their costs and paines expect at least a congratulatory connivance in the freedome of their consciences or will their swords now in the strong possession of so great a multitude know the way into their quiet scabbards without the expected liberty of their religions and can that liberty produce any thing but an establisht disorder and is not disorder the mother of anarchie and that of ruine open then your eyes closed with crasse and wilfull blindnesse and consider and prevent that which your continued disobedience will unavoidably repent too late
but the truth is they are all papists by your brand that comply not in this action with you admit it were so are not papists as tolerable for his majesty as anabaptists brownists separatists atheists antinomians turkes and indeed all religions and factions nay papists too for his subjects these of his majesties side come freely out of their allegiance as subjects yours are preached in comming out of obstinacie as rebels they at their own charges proportionable to their abilities these like iudas selling their soveraignes blood for ill paid wages yet both sides pretend a quarrell for the true protestant religion
good god what a monstrous religion is this that seeks protection from the implacable opposition of her two champions his majesty protests to maintain it the two houses protest to maintain it for an oedipus to read this riddle his majesty addes one clause more wherein if the other party would agree the work would be at an end which is

according to the establisht constitutions by oath taken by him at his coronation and there the two houses leave him contending for a yet undetermined alteration

and for my part dare not conceive such evill of the lords annointed and my gracious soveraigne as to feare him perjured
hath not his majesty in the presence of that god by whom hee reignes imprecated the curse of heaven on him and his royall posterity sub sigillo sacramenti too if he to his utmost maintaine not the true protestant religion exercised in that blessed queenes dayes and propagated by the blood of so many glorious martyrs at which time god blest this island in so high a measure if hee preserve not the just priviledges of parliament and the liberty of the subject nay more did not his majesty so promise the severe execution of the statute against all recusants that if he failed he desired not the ayde of his good subjects what inferiour person would not think his reputation wronged not to take up confidence upon such terrible termes what notorious evill hath his majesty perpetrated to quench the sparkles of a common charity consider consider hee acts his part before the king of kings whose eye is more especially upon him he acts his part before his fellow princes to whom he hath declared this his imprecation
hee acts his part before his subjects whose stricter hand weighes his pious words with too unequall ballances
were he the acknowledger of no god yet the princes of the earth if guilty of such a perjury would abhorre him
or were all the princes of the earth blind deafe or partiall would not he think his crown a burthen to be worne upon his perjured brow before his owne abused people or having renounced his subjects ayde upon his faile could he expect that loyalty which now he wants upon a meen suspition but he is a prince whom god hath crowned with graces above his fellowes a prince whom for his piety few ages could parallell
what vices of the times have branded his repute his youth high diet strength of body and soveraign power might have inclined and warpt him to luxurious vanity as well as other monarks whose effeminaries have enerved the strength of their declining kingdomes how many would have held it a preferment to be attorny to his royall lust or secretary to his bosom sinne yet he remaines a president of unblemisht chastity

he might have pleased and pampered up his wanton palate with the choise of curious wines to lighten cares which wait upon the regall diademe yet he continues the patterne of a chast sobriety he might have magnified his mercy and sold his justice to reward a service in pardoning offences committed by those of neare relation yet hee abides the example of inexorable justice

these and many other eminent graces and illustrious virtues can claime no birth from flesh and blood especially in those whose pupillages are strangers to correction nor is it safe divinity to acknowledge such high gifts from any hand but heaven
which being so my conscience and religion tells me that almighty god who is all perfection will not leave a work so forward so imperfect but will from day to day still adde and adde to his transcendent virtues till he appeare the glory of the world and after many yeares be crowned in the world of glory

the new distemper

hoc habet proprium ecclesia dum persecutione patitur floret dum opprimitur proficit dum laeditur vincit dum arguitur intelligit tunc stat quum superari videtur

oxford printed by leonard lichfield printer to the vniversity


the new distemper
as it is in a principality or in a republique
the further it swerves from the first constitution and fundamentall principles the faster it declines and hastens towards ruine so is it in the church the more she deviates and slips from her first foundations the more she growes into distempers and the nearer she comes to desolation
it hath been the wisdome of all princes and free states of former times to carry a watchfull eye upon the growing inconvenients of their kingdomes and republiques that as evill manners daily breed diseases so the continuall making and execution of good lawes should daily be prescribed as lest by too long neglect and sufferance the body of the commonwealth should grow so foule with superannuated evils and the humors waxe so prevalent that the desperatenesse of the disease might enforce them to as desperate a remedy

it is no lesse prudence and providence in those that are appointed by the supreme power as under him chiefe governours and overseers of the church to be very circumspect and not onely faithfully to exercise their ministeriall function by due and careful preaching of the gospel but likewise diligently to discharge

their office in governing that is in making wholsome ordinances and duly executing them that the inconveniences that grow daily in the church may be daily rectified lest by too long forbearance they gather head and so become either incureable or else capable of remedy with too great a losse

the naturall affection so dearly owe to this my native country to which my soule alwayes hath doth and will for ever as much happinesse as heaven can please to give permits me not to think our church in so forlorne and desperate a case but that it may be capable of a wholsome cure yet sense and reason flying with the naturall wings of love and duty bids me feare that those unnaturall humors pride negligence superstition schisme and that harbinger of destruction security have so long been gathering and now setled in her that she cannot without long time and much difficulty or else especiall providence and divine mercy be restored for the hastning whereof be that unworthy member that shall not apply the utmost of his endeavour and diligence and not returne the best of those abilities he suckt from her in health to her advantage in this her great and deplorable extremity of distemper
the wearyed physitian after his many fruitlesse experiments upon a consuming body advises his drooping patient to the place of his birth to draw that ayre he was first bred in the likelyest way to recover our languishing church is to reduce her to her first constitutions that she may draw the breath of her first principles from whence having made so long a journey her returne must take the longer time
the physitian requires not his crazie patient to take his progresse thither in a rumbling coach or a rude waggon they are too full of motion for a restlesse body nor to ride poste the swiftnesse of the passage makes too sudden an alteration of the climate but in an litter the flownesse of whose pace might give him a graduall change of ayre

the safest way to reduce our languishing church to her first constitution is to avoid all unnaturall commotions and violence in her passage and carefully to decline all sudden alterations

which cannot be without imminent danger and to use the meanes that may be that nothing in her journy may interrupt her and prove too prejudiciall to her journyes end

the disease of our distempered church cod be praised hath not as yet taken her principall parts her doctrine of faith is sound the distemper onely lyes in her discipline and govern+ment which hath these many yeeres breeding and now broken forth to the great dishonour of her mysticall head christ jesus to the unhappy interruption of her owne peace the legacie of our blessed saviour to the great disquiet of our gracious soveraigne her faiths defender to the sharp affliction of his loyall subjects her faithfull servants and to the utter ruine and destruction of this kingdome the peacefull palace of her glory

as for her discipline in the happy dayes of edward the sixt when all the romish rubbish and trumpery was seavengerd out of this the new reformed church and the wholsome doctrine of undubitable truth was joyfully received into her gates being for many yeeres with ignorance and error the piety and providence of her newly chosen governours whose spirituall abilities and valour were after characterd in their owne blood thought good in the first place to make gods worship the subject of their holy consideration to which end they met and finding in the scriptures no expresse forme of evangelicall discipline in each particular and therefore concluding it was left as a thing indifferent
to be instituted according to the constitutions of every kingdome where religion should be astablisht they advised what discipline might best conduce to the glory of god and the benefit of his people they first debated and put to the question whether the old lyturgie should be corrected and purged or whether a new should be contrived

cranmer then archbishop of canterbury a pious moderate and learned father of the church and not long after a glorious martyr finding that the old lyturgie had some things in it derived from the primitive church though in many things corrupted conceived it most fitting for the peace of the church not to

savour so much of the spirit of contradiction as utterly to abolish it because the papists used it but rather enclined to have the old garden weeded the errors expunged thereby to gaine some of the moderater sort of that religion to a conformity but ridly bishop of london a man though very pious yet of a quicker spirit and more violent and not many yeares after suffering martyrdome too enclined to a contrary opinion rather wishing a totall abolition of the old liturgie and a new to be set up lest the tender consciences of some should be offended

the businesse being thus controverted it was at length voted for the purging of the old to which service were appointed

whereof three were famous martyrs and the rest men of unquestionable sanctity soundnesse and learning which being done was authorized by act of parliament in that blessed kings reigne edw
and with a full consent received into the church of england confirmed by divers acts of parl in the dayes of
eliz
king iames and king charles our now gracious soveraigne whom almighty god long preserve

but this establisht discipline had no sooner being but enemies of which sort the devill hath alwayes instruments to nip the plants of religion in the bud whose number daily since encreasing grew hotter and hotter in opposition and stronger and stronger in faction being too long for peace fake conniv'd at and at last too unseasonably and violently opposed insomuch that the disease in these our late dayes grew too powerfull for the remedy so that the distemper of our church in that respect is growne so high that feare phlebotomy will rather produce a further languishment being already come to madnesse then a cure
nay so far have the enemies of this establisht government and discipline given way to their exorbitant and refractory opinion that they will neither allow the matter nor the forme nor the authority and testimony of the composers

not the matter though they cannot but acknowledge it in the generall to be very good yet because it was unsanctified by superstitious lips

not the forme because set and composed by humane invention

not the composers because bishops and so though martyrs for the cause of god and his true religion members of antichrist


as for their exceptions against the matter how ridiculous they are let reason judge have not superstitious tongues and eyes viewed and read the scriptures in their very originall and purity shall therefore the scriptures be disallowed have not superstitious persons profaned our churches with their popish doctrines sacraments and ceremonies and shall our churches therefore be cryed downe or shut against the ordinances of

god because those poets were heathenish was paul afraid to use their sayings was the spirit of god too blame to endite them good things abused work evill effects upon the abusers but lose not their goodnesse by the abuse


as for their exceptions against the forme being set and not conceived the authority of the scriptures hope will answer
god the father warrants it god the son prescribes it god the holy ghost allowes it

god the father warrants it in the old testament at the time of the law by his command to moses numb

where he gives him a set forme and words to blesse the people the lord blesse thee and keep thee the lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee

god the sonne prescribes it in the new testament in the time of the gospel iohn the baptist had taught his disciples to pray the disciples of jesus christ whose house was called the house of prayer humbly requested the fame boone from him who prescribed them that forme which he had formerly used in the end of his sermon mat

which he intended not as a model as some would have it but a very prayer it selfe to be used in those very words as they were delivered luke

not after this manner but when ye pray undefined span alphabet say
that he will'd the same words to be used is evident for his disciples would be taught as iohn taught his and how were they taught iohn taught them the words onely he could not give them the spirit to make an extemporary descant upon them
so that being a direct set forme it warranted set formes which were used from the beginning of the primitive church from whence this part of our discipline had her originall

god the holy spirit allowes it who dare question that the holy spirit inspired paul in all his epistles written to the churches in all which epistles he concludes with this one prayer the grace of our lord iesus christ


as for their exceptions against the composers of this lyturgie who were no lesse then holy martyrs and by saw more revelations then these objectors did by

men of approved learning and true piety though some have impudence and spirituall pide enough to think their owne abilities and inspiratious to flye a higher pitch and ignorance enough to acknowledge greater knowledge in themselves yet the most humble able and truly sanctified minds have alwaies had martyrdome in so high reverence that they conclude that god that made their blood the seed of the church and gave them the courage and honour to dye in the maintenance of the truth would not permit that seed to bring forth such darnel of superstition or them to die guilty of those errors they so resolutely cryed down with their dying blood


as for her government by episcopacie the extirpation wherof being a great addition to her distemper it hath as much or more ius divinum to plead then that which endeavours to demolish succeed it presbyterie both are but mentioned in the scripture at large but no particular rules for the executing the office of either which being left wholly as arbitrary it rests in the power of the supreme magistrate whom god hath constituted his vicegerent to choose and establish which may best be found consistent with the constitutions of the kingdome and stand to most advantage with the civil government
but admit the civil government will stand with either when the balances stand eavenly poised the least grain turns it
in things indifferent the smallest circumstance casts it

this island of bitaine if we look back above yeares being a long prescription when she first received the faith was then governed by king lucius whom god made a great instrument for reducing of this kingdome from paganisme who sending to rome and accommodated from thence with two christian and learned divines by their labours and gods assistance upon them planted the gospel at the beginning of which plantation and flamins were put downe and in their roome archbishops and bishops were introduced which government successively continued and flourisht through the reigns of many wise princes confirmed by many acts of parliament since the reformation exercised and approved by holy martyrs and allowed of as most fitting until the yeare of our lord

at which time multitudes of the lower sort of people throughout this kingdome petitioned and tumultuously troubled the parliament so that some of the members perchance according to their inclination and others for quietnesse sake consented to the abolition and extirpation of episcopacy the unadviz'd contents of their clamorous petitions

now if these governments hierarchicall and presbyteriall be indifferent these circumstances first of the time when episcopall government began secondly of the unintermissive continuance for so many ages thirdly the credit of the persons confirming and approving it me thinks should cast such a kind of necessity upon it that the other being an untry'd government and having no consent or approbation from the supreme magistrate and being onely cryed in by the ignorant multitude affected to novelties and change should have no wise friend to plead for it

we reade in the scriptures of elders which are members of a presbyterie as it is written

titus

for this cause left thee in creete that thou shouldest set in order things that are wanting and ordaine elders in every city as had appointed thee
also pet


the elders which are among you
exhort who am also an elder
by which it appears that titus had instructions to set up a presbyterie

you take the scriptures by snatches

had you read in titus the next verse following but one you would have had saint pauls meaning with his words viz ver
for a bishop must be blamelesse as the steward of god not
so that it plainly appeares that elders mentioned in the
verse are expounded bishops in the
or had you compared saint peters first verse before mentioned with his fift in the same chapter you would have found elders no positive but a relative word no office but a degree of age
ver
likewise the younger submitting themselves to the elder the apostle here shewing what the behaviour of the elder ministers should be towards god and of the younger towards them
so that if either of them had set up a presbyterie it was suddenly pulled downe againe and episcopacie which you so much dislike placed in the roome

we are so far from disliking bishops

that where there is one we desire there were twenty nay that every church in england and ireland had a severall bishop diocesan bishops we dislike parochiall we allow

how suddenly to crosse a setled and warranted establishment your windmill fancies can make an alteration

titus

had a co~mand from paul to ordain elders in every city which he interprets bishops not in every church or parish which ordinance the church of england hath punctually observed from the primitive times to this day
but you have refractory and spirits spirits of contradiction that understand not the scriptures but by your owne interpretations alwayes stirring but never setled hating order despising government and resisting all authority

but this episcopall government had her originall from rome

and being poysoned in the root it cannot be wholsome in the branch

ignorance is the mother of all error

your chronologie failes you if you carefully search antiquities you will find your objection against it a good argument for it
confesse episcopacie had her originall from rome but in those dayes when we conformed according to the church of rome the church of rome conformed according to the word of god
rome was then part of the primitive church not being above
yeares after christ the bishops of rome were then so far from being antichrists that most of them were martyrs and dyed for christ

but our bishops have too great revenues

whereby they are occasioned to riot pomp and glory

those princely benefactors whose bountifull pieties thought nothing too much for gods ambassadours

and therefore enlarged their revenues so much well knew their places and callings requir'd it whose gates were to be open to all commers and bread to be given to all that wanted
their places owe reliefe to the fatherlesse comfort to the widow supplies to the needy and succour to all that are afflicted and hospitality to all strangers
no their great revenues are greater then inconveniences if not abused

but these great revenues might have been decimated

and the tenth part might have sufficiently maintained a preaching ministry and the nine other parts might have been added to the kings revenues which would have made him the richest and most glorious king in christendome and taken away the necessity of subsidies from the subject

this is robbing peter to pay paul

beggering the keyes to inrich the sword and the next way to bring a curse upon the king and all his people in generall by a generall guilt of sacriledge
the shewbread must not be eaten but upon more necessity then god be thanked his majesty was at that time put to
the holy oyle must not be put unto a civil use but his majesties pious and resolute refusall hath in one word fully and fairely answered this objection

but bishops have too absolute a power

which gives them occasion and opportunity to be tyrannicall and to exercise an arbitrary jurisdiction over their brethren

from the beginning

confesse it was not so neither stands it with wisdome or policy to suffer it to be so for the government of the church must have proportion with the government of the state government of severall natures in one nation breeds confusion and that ruine we therefore being a mixt monarchy necessarily require a mixture likewise in the hierarchy which excledes all arbitrary power

it is true absolute monarchy and an unlimited hierarchy are apt to fall into the distemper of tyrannie and democracie and a parity in government is as apt to run into the disease of tumult but of the two evils tyrannie is the least by how much it is the easier to be cured
a monster with one head is sooner overcome then a hidra with many
if our hierarchy hath slipt into this irregularity it is great wisdome and reason for a parliament to rectifie it

but the king having the sole election of bishops

and so much favouring them will hardly consent to the abridgement of their power and greatnesse so that being his creatures their power wil be upheld by him to the end that upon any difference betwixt him and his people they may be the more able to uphold him

and ready to make a strong party for him so that the more their power is weakned the lesse his party will be prevalent whereby his prerogative may want advocates and the liberty of the subject no enemies

his majesty

by his yeelding to the bill of taking away their votes in parliament hath given a sufficient earnest of a further moderation of their power and no question was and will be ready to hearken to this or such like humble and reasonable petitions for the extirpating this jelousie viz
that when any bishop dyes or is translated he would give liberty to the whole clergie and freeholders of those diocesses to choose nominate present foure learned and religious divines most unblameable in and doctrine able for government and diligent in preaching of which foure his majesty to prick one which maybe consecrated bishop of the dioces by which meanes both his majesty and his people having an interest in him he will be equally engaged who in cases of difference may become rather a mediator then partaker and receiving just power from the king may execute it as uprightly amongst his people

but they are lords

and lord it over gods inheritance whereas pet


forbids it be not lords over gods inheritance and christ luk

sayes the kings of the earth exercise lordship but it shall not be so with you

our bishops were lords

as they were peeres of the land and as peeres they had votes in parliament which being taken away they are no more now then what the dignity of their calling and their owne merits make them
as for that place in peter thus it is meant ye shall not be lords over gods inheritance that is tyrants lords and rulers being at that time none but heathens and persecutors whose tyrannie made the very name of lord terrible and odious so that in that place by lordship is certainly meant tyrannie
neither can this imply a parity in our church for without a superiority and inferiority there can be no government a parity cannot be considered in order of government but onely in the work of the ministry
in this all are fellow labourers in the other some command and some obey paul and timothy had an especiall command and charge over

other ministers
as for that place in luke which you alledge the disciples striving who should be the greatest among them our blessed saviours answer was to this effect let kings exercise power and authority over their vassals as indeed their tyrannie made them little better but it shall be otherwise with you you are all to me that am your chiefe lord and bishop of your soules whilst am here all superiority lyes extinct christ was then the onely governour and the root of government was in him but at his departure he gave some to be apostles some to be pastors and yet all those degrees were equall in respect of the work he himselfe said ye call me lord and so am and yet luk

am among you as he that serveth whereby it manifestly appeares he intended a parity of the workers in respect of the worke not a parity in the government in respect of the workers

bishops whose office is to promote religion

and to advance the gospel as is pretended and to encourage prenching as the ordinary meanes conducing thereunto are so far from so doing that instead thereof they silence godly ministers and put downe weekly lectures which were set up at the proper charges and the piety of the people and to the great establishment of true religion

here lyes a mysterie

being the most crafty advantage the devil ever took of popular piety

admit the piety of the honest hearted people was the first motive to these weekly lectures how was that piety abused by those weekly lecturers they were chosen by the people their maintenance consisting most of gratuities came from the people which ebbed or flowed according as their lunatick doctrines wrought upon the people
those lecturers whose whole subsistance thus proceeded from the people must for their owne better livelyhoods please the people and what more pleasing to the people then the preaching of liberty and how should liberty be enlarged if not peeced with prerogative then down goes authority and up goes priviledge downe goes the booke and up goes the spirit downe goes learning and up goes revelation who gaining credit in the weak opinions of the vulgar

grew the seminaries of all ignorance and the nursing fathers of all rebellion
these are those godly lecturers that bishops put downe who never lost themselves so much as in not setting up better and more orthodox in their roomes which had taken away the ground of this objection

our bishops being proud

idle covetous and popishly affected are therefore fit to be extirpated

admit some be so must therefore such among them as are humble diligent charitable and enemies to popery perish shall they that are bad have more power to pull downe a setled government then they that be good to keep it up did moses the man of god extirpate the government of priesthood because aaron had a hand in the peoples idolatry or will you undertake that the elders in a presbyteriall government shall be all faultlesse let the guilty receive their respective punishments and let others take their office but the innocent to suffer with the guilty is a point of high injustice

but admit this government by bishops had nothing to plead for it neither prescription nor continuance without intermission nor the authority of parliaments in all ages yet considering it is now a government in being it seemes not consonant to reason or policy to extirpate it or take it away before an other government be pitcht upon
to pull downe one maine pillar before another be made to supply the place and to support the roome is the next way to pull the roofe upon our heads hath not episcopacie been long voted downe and is not the assembly at this time divided and in controversie nay puzzled what government to set up in the roome of it by which means occasion is administred to all disorder liberty lyes open to all schismes sects and heresies and sectaries grow bold to vent their giddy headed opinions without controlment confirming themselves in their owne errors infecting others with their new fangled and itching doctrines the nature whereof is like a tetter to run till it the whole body
have not our eyes beheld all this which if these unsetled times should long continue as god forbid would gather such head and strengthen this our confused kingdome that if her issue of blood were stopt in one

place it would break forth in another and like hercules his monster if one head were struck off another would arise to the utter confusion of the true protestant religion which already begins to be the least part of this tottering kingdoms profession and rather conniv'd at then exerciz'd by some
are not complaints preferd against brownists and separatists

unheard nay are not men afraid to complain against them for feare of punishment have not protest anabaptists challenged our ministers to dispute with them in their owne open churches have not their disputations been permitted nay unadvisedly undertaken by some of our ministers who themselves are thought little better wherein they have made many proselites and left many of the vulgar who judge the victory to the most words indifferent have they not after their disputations retired into their innes and private lodgings accompanyed with many of their auditors and all joyned together in their extemporary prayers for a blessing upon their late exercise how often hath which they lately have baptiz'd new iordan been witnesse to their prophanations how many daily make their private meetings and assemble in the city of london to exercise their ministery how many have been convicted of blasphemy and yet unpunisht how many times have their witnesses been taken against some of our most learned and religious ministers for which some are plundered some sequestred and some imprisoned how many of our ministers whose severity proceeded formerly against fornicators adulterers drunkards swearers and such like are now undone upon their revengefull witnesses and testimony appearing now for the better colouring of their malice well affected to the cause all which in time will so encourage all sects factions hypocrites and make heresie so bold strong in this kingdome that the true protestant religion will be under the detestable name of popery even turned out of doores for company or at least so little favoured that it will be forced to shrowd it selfe in corners as those sectaries did before these troubles were



but when things are setled and iustice done upon the popish faction these sectaries with their sects will vanish like the

mist before the mid day sun and a true reformed religion will be establisht to us and our posterity

you seeme by this objection but a young state physitian

and a meere novice in the curing of a disease of this nature
in some cases where the undisturbed humors keep their bounds distempers are quickly evaporated and being scatterd through the whole body every part breathes out some and nature being able to truckle with the disease by her owne power relieves her selfe and in a short time rectifies the body but upon a continuall confluence and gathering head of lawlesse humors she is so weakned that she hath no power to resist and lesse heart to struggle with her enemy but is forced to yeeld but the time you prefixe for the subduing of these numerous sects is first when all things are setled secondly when the land is cleared of papists


for the first it is all one as if you had said when the body is in good health you will easily find a cure
a rare physitian in the meane while you will connive at this continued confluence of humors which makes it at length incureable


as for the second take heed while ye goe about to cure a fever you run not the body politick into a dropsie with too much phlebotomie
but you will first cleare the kingdome of papists and who be they in your accompt all such as stand for episcopall government a government coetaneous with this our almost religion all such as approve of the book of common prayer a forme establisht by many acts of protestant parliaments all such as are passively obedient and loyall to his majestie a duty commanded by gods own mouth of the clergie all such as will not preach for blood although ministers of the gospel of peace
all such as will not take the covenant to suppresse bishops although they have formerly sworn canonicall obedience to their ordinary all such as wil not encourage subjects to resist the power of their naturall prince although having taken the oath of allegeance and the late protestation
and to conclude all that have not contributed willingly bountifully and continually to this warre and in a word that have any considerable estates to pick a hole in if all

sects and sectaries be not supprest till then we are like to have a comfortable reformation

but in case you onely meane such papists as owne and acknowledge the doctrine of the church of rome tell me what course would you take with either you must banish them or disinherit them or take away their lives

if banish them it must be done either with the kings consent or against it if against it you resist the power and he that resisteth shall receive damnation rom
if with it you make the king guilty of perjury who hath sworne to protect all his subjects in his coronation oath
if disinherit them it must be done either according to the known lawes of the kingdome or against them according to the lawes ye cannot for there is no law for it
if against them you transgresse what you pretend to maintaine in all your declarations

if take away their lives it must be done either for a cause or without a cause if for a cause shew it that the world may be satisfied if without a cause you are guilty of murther
which course soever ye take you have not christ for your example who quietly suffered the two caesars being idolaters not onely to possesse that kingdome but to usurp it because god permitted them and permissively placed them there when the disciples askt our blessed saviour didst not thou sow good wheat whence commeth it that there be tares his answer was the evil one hath done it
his pleasure being demanded whether they should weed them up his reply was no let them alone untill the harvest and then he would separate them
a good deed may be ill done when either against command or without warrant
though god hath permitted the evill one to plant papists among us yet he hath not authorized us to root them up nor yet to take the lives of any untill their actions come within the danger and compasse of the establisht lawes of the land

we have presidents for the rooting out of idolaters in the scriptures

which warrant us to doe the like

you finde it no where

but in the time of the law at which time god immediately commanded it which kind of warrants are now ceased

again in the time of the law some were accompted strangers and strangers had not the priviledges that brethren have
vsury was lawfull to be taken of strangers not of brethren now in the times of the gospel christ hath made us all brethren and called us by his own name christians and what was lawfull then to be done to strangers is unwarrantable now to be done to christians
we are brethren

then protestantisme and popery may be consistent in one kingdom

and gods name may be harmelesly prophaned with idolaetry and superstition in the same place where it is truly and sincerely worshipt

your inference is not good

it is one thing for a prince to protect his subjects and an other to be partaker with them or to allow of their superstitions
kings cannot enforce consciences though pitcht upon a false religion all that magistrates can do against them unlesse for seducing which a particular statute made treason is to punish their purses for not observing his statutes respectively or for exercising their religion contrary to his lawes but well it were if such a necessity of connivance had no such subject to work upon

how happy had it been for this unlucky kingdom if his majesties most prudent and pious offer two yeare since propounded to us had been accepted in this particular that all the children of his subjects of that religion should be taken from them and educated in the religion of the church of england by which means the whole kingdom in a short space of time would have been peaceably reduced to an vnity in doctrine and if the same course were taken with othe srectaryes an vniformity in discipline also
but our kingdom must not expect an universall and through reformation in all particulars till catechismes be more strictly used and the entercourse of embassadours which cannot simply be avoyded and legers be restrained and strict statutes made and executed against sectaries

but to returne to our first matter
admit episcopacy were a

government accidentally inconvenient and that a more fitting government were discovered prepared and made ready to be set up it would be but a new untryed government and not experimentally known what proportion it would beare without temporall constitutions
a horse may be well metled and conditioned and every way commendable for the saddle yet not draw well in a coach or chariot a great part of our is built upon the cases of bishops insomuch that if that government be changed there must be a necessary alteration of many lawes of the land and what inconvenience may arise from such an alteration leave to the judgment of lawyers being not unworthy of some consideration

but let these things be accompted not inconveniencyes and that the hierarchicall government is fit to be demolished either for the abuse of it by some few exorbitant prelates or for the mischiefes that follow in respect of it self in that it administers such occasion of offence yet the too sudden execution of a busines of so great a consequence and concernment gives a livelier testimony of passion then discretion if polititions may have credit and savours of extremity which is opposite to all virtue and too much rashnesse the distemper of all serious and honorable undertakings too sudden an alteration in matters of small moment passes not without some inconvenience but in things of such a nature as a government nay a church government too the nursery of the whole kingdoms happinesse or misery it cannot be without imminent danger but the sudden alteration of a fundamentall government of the church which necessarily carryes the state with it threatens nay brings no lesse then unavoidable ruine to both
a rashnesse too much we feare relishing of private ends to demolish that government in twelve moneths which hath been setting up and maintained by as wise generations as ours above fourteene hundred yeeres

how happy had it been for this at that time prosperous but now miserable kingdome had we taken the advantage of that greatest blessing that ever gracious prince conferred upon unthankfull subjects the trienniall parliament wherein we

might every years have inspected this new recoverd kingdome and kept it alwayes in a perfect crisis the approaching terror whereof would not have afforded popular evils so long a time or liberty to root themselves or gather head against the peace and welfare of our happy government through the benefit whereof we might have taken an advantageous leisure and mature deliberation to ripen every bill and by degrees to rectifie every nonag'd grievance and indeed what happines was there which we had not then an offerd opportunity to bring upon this now unhappy land the government of the state as in many things it was reduced into an excellent temper so questionlesse had not this unnaturall difference interposed it had in all things by the continued goodnesse and favour of his sacred majesty been perfected to the comfort of us and the happinesse of succeeding generations

the government of the church likewise might by the vertue of the granted trienniall been narrowly and exactly searcht into the governours strictly observed the bad turned out and changed for better they that deserved punishment punisht according to their misdemeanours others lesse offending through some neglect reproved and checkt and upon no amendment the next trienniall proceeded against accordingly
the was not presently cut downe root and branch but suffered till another yeare and punishments before an admonition are too rashly and severely inflicted
thus by this graduall and trienniall course mercy and justice would have incorporated the government of the church had been establisht the peace of this kingdome had been secured the bad governours had been rectified or removed the good encouraged and honoured and peace and truth had kist each other

but the multitudes of these our nationall sins were too great to permit so great a blessing on this nation as the benefit of this trienniall prrliament
god suffered abraham to see the holy land but for the transgressions of the people not to possesse it god shewed us a glimpse of that mercy which our sins made us unworthy to enjoy and snacht it from us
in which respect we

are now left to our owne wayes and governed by our owne inventions and what is we are neither penitent for our nationall sins nor our owne nor what is worst of all sensible of gods iudgements nor our owne miseries

how often have our moderne ministers in their unmeditated prayers before the open congregation given god joyfull thanks for these blessed times

whereas if their hearts had not been hasty to utter any things before god they might have rather petitioned for a removall of these his terrible judgements how often have they prayed for the continuance of these happy dayes whereas

had not their mouthes been rash they might better have deprecated those miseries
how often have they in their sermons blasphemously challenged god upon the forfeiture of his justice to crowne their cause with victory how often instead of wholsome doctrine have they delivered such reports as their consciences knew fables and were before next sabboth lyes upon record how often have they preached downe subjection to princes and encouraged the sword to grow warme in the blood of christians how often have they articled against orthodoxe able and learned divines and crowded themselves into their livings who upon my certaine knowledge some of them can neither make true latine nor write good english and then lay their preferment upon the wisdome of the parliament how many children above a yeare old because their fathers are suspected to be loyall to their prince continue unbaptiz'd many parishes can witnesse
how long time is it since the last sacrament of the lords supper was administred let the people tell if their memories be so good and then the elements deliverd in their owne new devised words
these are now the faithfull ministers of the gospel of peace these the ministers of this blessed reformation these the men that must pull downe antichrist out of his seat and set up christ iesus in his throne nay rather these are they that for filthy lucre carry men about with divers and strange doctrines these are the men that in former times separated themselves sensuall having not the spirit
these are they that despise dominion and speak evill of dignities these are such as have gone the way of cain and run greedily after the

error of balaam for reward and have perished in the of core

the feare spyes in your feasts of charity feeding themselves without feare clouds that are without water carried about with the winde

rageing waves of the sea out their own shame to whom is reserved the blacknesse of darknesse for ever

is not this a blessed priesthood are not these rare materialls for a hopefull presbytery for the house of god are not the two great nurseryes of this kingdom like to flourish when the chiefe plants are pulled up by the roots and onely suffered to prosper and beare their own naturall fruit our fathers have eaten the grapes and their childrens teeth will be set on edge
they that have been the pillars of our religion are hewn down and our falling church is shored up with these inconsiderable spars
they that grappled with and foyld the stoutest champions of the church of rome are imprisoned wanting both bread and liberty and such as neither did nor could nor durst appeare in such a quarrel are crownd with their reward they whose learning and orthodox piety made england the glory of nations and the envy of forraigne kingdoms are now disgraced and ruined and that learning made not capable of a degree advanced and honoured to the great dishonour of this kingdom

nor can heare forget how much this staggering church of england owes to her pious and religious nursing father and her faiths royall defender our gracious soveraigne whose wisdom moderation and tender piety amongst other of his princely vertues hath so manifesty showed it self in not following the example of those whom my heart bleeds to call his enemyes and blazing the new ministry of this kingdom as they have done the old had his provoked passion publisht a century to the eye of all the world of those morall vices hideous blasphemies infirmities and faylings of the clergy of the one party as they did on the other how would the church of rome and all the enemies of the gospel of jesus christ have hissed and derided our religion that by the generall confession both of prince and people had such monsters to adorne it how would forraigne christians have been frighted at the very name of the church of england

how would the stile of protestant have become the obloquy and by word of all religions it was not for want of matter report would have enough besides that which perchance would have made the truer history

nor was it scarcity of to paint their actions to the life oxford had yet hath pens sharp enough ink that wanted no gall nor can conceive how such nimble active and such salik fancyes here could have forborne it had not the wisdom providence of his sacred majesty laid upon them his restraining power by which it evidently appeares to those that are not obstinately maliciously blinded with the darknesse of resolved rebellion that his majesties solemne vowes and serious protestations for the maintaining the honour of the true protestant religion agree with his most pious intentions and published resolutions had his secret affections been warpt or the least degree wavering from the church of england or any whit inclining to the romish superstition had the imaginations of his heart intended secretly an introduction of the popish religion how could his new design been better animated then by an inward dislike of the protestant religion how could that dislike have been better fomented and encouraged then by the advantage the just advantage taken of the generall corruption of her ministry but the wisdom and tendernesse of his piety stands silent in this behalfe and in his singular prudence hath not so much as taken notice or in any of his declarations once reproved the uncharitable impiety of that scandalous pamphlet for fear of further blazing it but rather suffering it to perish in its own filthines choosing rather to groane under the burthen of his faithfull and abused clergie then by revenging and painting forth the crimes of the other party far more guilty to afflict religion under the burthen of both

nor mercy in the sons of men

thou art my portion god and will trust in thee

although thou kill me
will not trust in my bow

it is not my shield that can save me but it is thou alone god that canst deliver us
deliver us god from the evil men preserve us from the cruell men which imagine evill in their hearts and make warre continually
have mercy lord have mercy upon us

for we have suffered too much contempt
heare the mourning of the prisoners

and deliver the children from death

they have consulted together in heart and have made a league against thee

we are a reproach to our neighbours even a scorne and derision to them that are round about us

let thy priests be clothed with righteousnesse and let thy saints rejoyce
lord how long wilt then hide thy selfe

for ever shall thy wrath burne like fire wilt thou be angry with us for ever

wilt thou prolong thy wrath from generation to generation

behold god our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed
let thine hand be upon the man of thy right hand whom thou hast made so strong for thyself
give thy iudgements to the king

and thy righteousnesse to the kings sonne

that peace may be in his dayes and let his enemies lick the

dust clothe his enemies with shame but upon his head let his crowne flourish

how long shall the wicked lord how long shall the wicked triumph they prate and speak fiercely and the workers of iniquity vaunt themselves

they smite downe thy people lord and trouble thine inheritance
they slay the widow and the stranger

the whipper vvhipt there came by chance to my hand a pamphlet called the whip whose pharisaicall author pretended a transcendent zeale to my first eye but after a leafes perusall found his flame so extreamly hot that his religion seemed for want of due stirring burnt too and so much tasted of the brasse that no orthodox palate could relish it nor a conscience digest it the namelesse author had an spirit and the government he best affected was anarchie he was a salamander his very dwelling was in fire his heart was a sink of ignorance is spleen a spring of gall a shemei a rabshekah his mouth ran bitternesse and malice and his pen flow'd venime and rebellion

the object of this fiery pamphlet was the orthodox most excellent work of doctor cornelius burges a man of singular parts and at this time a worthy member of the synod or assembly of divines entituled the fire of the sanctuary newly discovered or a compleat tract of zeale and printed by george miller and richard badger anno

into zeale which hath swallowed up and devoured their duty to their betters their faire demeanour to their equalls and their charity to all relations

this unwo thy pamphleter in the progresse of his more unworthy work against this worthy member uses that method which the prince of flyes prescribes him who like a fly buzzes through his whole larder blowing here there but such fruitfull corruption that in short time his whole store nay if possible the very bread of life moulded by the hand of heaven which hee hath set apart in his margent would grow unsavoury
he begins at the dedication epistle repeating the doctors words then poysoning them with his owne calumnies whereunto if patience equall readers will admit me by the name of a replyer you shall have all woven together in one loome wherein purpose not to load your eares with those his frivolous preambles and impertinences which would swell this pamphlet beyond your patience but suddenly to rush into the list
burges dedication title
to the right honourable william earle of pembroke calumniator

popery and superstition at the first dash dedication is a meer ceremony begun by the antichristian hierarchy derived from deo and dicatio which is a vowing to god it was first used when steeplehouses or were built which papists call churches dedicating them to god or to those they honoured as much saints whereof some of them are now roring in hell under which pretence they juggled holyness into them more then into barnes or stables now this book the doctor dedicates to the earle of pembroke whereby he secretly acknowledges him either a god or a saint if a god he blasphemes if a saint he lyes for he was a courtier and preferd the king before the elect

whereas saints imitate god and should be no respecters of persons in whose eyes kings and subjects are alike

replyer
when ignorance hath shot forth her shady leaves how quickly impiety budds and then how suddenly rebellion blossoms ignorance first taught thee a false of a word then impiety suggests a slight estimation of a church and then rebellion insinuates a disreputation of a king

a true chip of the old block canterbury who after he had familiarized the name of the altar in the common eare not daring to bring in transubstantiation with a full tide innocently left out those words in his service book which onely made the difference betwixt a sacrifice and the sacrament so that but one step more and the work had been fully done
so this our doctor not daring to urge ceremonies too loud left the godly should heare him sets the peaceable custome of the former saints betwixt him and the danger of all good mens censure
he made the example of the saints the wall by which his creeping popery might hold for feare of falling who had not this blessed parliament dropt down from heaven to crush these superstitions in their rise had been by this as perfect a proficient as the worst had had his high tricks his low tricks and perchance his merry tricks too as well as his fellowes

god made a law that every word of an accusation should be establisht by two or three witnesses this law is revived by the apostle in the gospel and applyed to the case of ministers

it were therefore a most uncharitable and unchristian course upon a bare accusation of an enemy to condemne a minister before himself be heard and a competent number of witnesses of worth produced against him
cal

how now doctor doth your guilt begin to call for more witnesses are you tormented before your time the law you speake on would in these dayes be nedlesse our ministers faults are now writ in their foreheads and as apparent as the sun at noone whose leud looser conversations are impudent confessions and visibly manifest enough without farther witnesses our century is both witnesses and and the pious composer thereof a most sufficient iudge but some there be so craftily vitious that they can keep their words and actions from the eyes and cares of men for such hold a reasonable presumption evidence enough others there be whose vices want no witnesses but perchance their witnessses as the too partiall world expounds it want worth and credit
some measure worth by a visible estate some by unimpeachable honesty of body or behaviour others by a religious demeanour according to establisht canstitutions whereas for my part if a poor handicrafts

man or whose infirmity denies him a honesty or whose piety is a little zealously refractory to establisht discipline nay be he a convicted anabaptist or blasphemer or what not in case it be for the cause that brings an accusation or appears a witnesse against a malignant minister question not but such a witnesse may be valuable

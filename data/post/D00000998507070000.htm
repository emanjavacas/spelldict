And if the parties shall haue onely letters to deliuer to any within the Court, then not to come within the Court gates, but to send the same letters to the persons to whom they are directed, from whom when they shall haue answere, they shall not longer continue neere to the Court, vpon paine of imprisonment.
Finally, her Maiestie commandeth that no maner of person allowed to attend in her Court, shal repaire to London, or to the suburbes or places within two miles of the Citie, nor any other Citie, Borough, Towne, Village, or places infected, without special licence of the Counsailor or other officer vnder whom he serueth, in writing to be shewed to any officer that shall seeke to impeach him, vpon paine to bee imprisoned by attachment of the knight Marshall or of his officers, if the partie shall not shew in writing sufficient warrant both for his going and returning.
Her Maiestie also straightly chargeth and commandeth the Knight Marshall of her Houshold, that he shall cause due search to be made of all Vagabonds commonly called Rogues that shall haunt about the Court, or in any places within the Verge, and them to apprehend and commit, to bee ordered and punished according to the lawes prouided for such offendours.

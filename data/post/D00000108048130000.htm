to the right worshipful the court of directors of the scots affrican and indian company the defence of the scots abdicating of darien is humbly dedicated

right worshipful gentlemen

the immense priviledges and immunities wherewith your present sovereign and indulgent father william the second hath invested your company by that octroy of the year argues his good inclinations towards you so far that whilst he was in the warmest trenches of namure and not sure but that act might be his last legacy authoriz'd you and your successors to plant and maintain colonies in whatever part

or parts of asia affrica and america you pleas'd provided these places or territories were not the propriety of such european princes or states as were in alliance of amity with his majesty and freed you for the space of twenty one years from all duties on the product of such plantations
you were not only impower'd to defend your colonies and trade by force of arms but likewise had his majesty's promise to interpose the regal authority to do you right in case you were disturb'd in such legal possession or trade and that at the publick charge to be presum'd of the ancient kingdom
his majesty having thus granted you so large and glorious a patent no to be paralell'd by that of any company or society in the universe much less by any of his royal ancestors your native or unforeign kings both the present and after ages will expect that the same should be transmitted by you the present directors to your successors without any stain or blemish that may incur the hazard of a forfeiture and that by your management your children may reap the benefits of it with the same if not with more advantages

this emboldens the author who was the first person employ'd in your service for your foreign expedition and the first who left it to lay the following sheets at your feet
and he takes upon him to put you in mind that if you had not misapply'd the money intrusted to your management the want whereof is so much felt at home by the great number of needy persons who expected their dividends before now
and if you had listen'd to the wholesome advice of mr douglass an eminent and experienc'd man in india who offer'd himself for your pilot and his substance for your security which was more than the three best shares in your capital stock and had not been bewitch'd to the golden dreams of paterson the pedlar and at last whimsical projector you might e'er now have been possest of a good colony in india where no body could disturb you and not have run on an airy project which altho you should have met with an opposition from the spaniard four times your capital stock could not have brought to any reasonable pitch of answering the end
and had you been masters of so much management and temper as to have sav'd that fifty thousand pounds which you squander'd away on those six hulks you built at amsterdam and hamburgh purely to make a noise there of your proceedings whereby

you thought to decoy the innocent dutch men or at least their gelt into your net and had therewith bought a couple of secondhand ships in the river of thames and dispatch'd them to india with a suitable cargoe not of scotch cloth slippers periwigs and bibles you might have had such returns e'er now as would have buoy'd you up so far above water as you needed not proclaim to the smiling world so many publick ropings of the shares of your capital stock
quos deus or jupiter perdere vult eos dementat

if you were thus perswaded to run headlong on a blind project at which the trading part of the world stand amaz'd the india companies of england and holland laugh at in their sleeve and the rest of mankind admire that people in their right senses should be guilty of and if the same should miscarry by your own ill management to say no worse on't tis not fair you should snarle at your neighbours who have no other hand in your misfortune than that they would not be accessary to any act which the world might judge felonious and wherein they could not join without ingaging themselves in an unreasonable war

and in the end to assist you with weapons to break their own heads
william the second who as you say in an untainted line is the king that hath wore your regal diadem has wrought and fought sufficiently for the gift your nation prudently thought their interest to make him
or admit it should be true that there was no private interest consulted by those generous donators yet it is obvious to the world that by being subjects of the king of great britain you are not only shaded from the insults of all nations but by the authority of your british sovereign you are freed from the daily feuds and bloody little wars which before the union for a tract of time not less than years were continually raging amongst your selves which unnatural massacres your native princes were so unable to suppress that when the contending clans or parties were glutted with one anothers blood and desir'd the benefit of the princely mediation those were pleas'd to accept of the office of umpires in patching up the feuds till such time as the young fry came of age to fight it out
these barbarities have been quite turn'd out of doors since the union and they are now either almost or altogether forgot neither are they to be reviv'd unless it be by

this separation of three or four months date
your people now enjoy the blessings of heaven and product of the earth and ocean without any interruption and whereas formerly they liv'd on the mountains and under the shelter of some strong rocks or castles they are now come down to the plains and can sleep sound in beds without the least apprehension of blood and rapine
and to crown your felicity you have now a free enjoyment of the gospel in the fulness and purity thereof which has ever been reckon'd the chief care and blessing of all political bodies
you are at liberty to say your prayers either in form or out of form which you please without any dread of sophistical impositions by romish or malignant priests
and now you praise your maker in stately churches whereas formerly these gallant men your ancestors were oblig'd to offer on such altars as jacob made and to whisper their prayers or carrols through the cliffs of the mountains or the chimney of some house whose wall was some twelve or fourteen foot thick
all these blessings you owe to heaven and the british monarchy whatever some vitiated and deprav'd palates perswade you to the contrary
the mask'd champion of your company whose tongue is much too big for his mouth is in pain because he cannot spurt out all his venom at one blast
however reasonable it be that the gentleman's zeal should atone for his want of power yet must acquaint you that his quarrel with the english nation is as unjust and groundless as your settling a colony in another man's dominions unless by virtue of your presbyterian tenent viz of dominions being founded in grace you who are the presumptive elect pretend a divine right to the goods of the wicked and so take upon you to cloath the seven councellors of your colony with such another commission as god gave the hebrews when they departed out of egypt

have no inclination to offer any thing in opposition to the gallantry of your ancestors who took so much care to keep themselves independent of another nation
and altho pretend to know the thread of the scotish and british story full as well as the author of the defence yet out of respect to the country where drew my first breath tho owe it nothing else will offer nothing to the prejudice of it's ancient fame but if point at some errata's of this author do it purely to reconcile mistakes and to make a distinction betwixt the scotch company and scots

nation being so much the latter's friend as to wish them not to embrak in so rotten a bottom as this of your company until you are on an honester footing than you appear to be at present that the honour of the ancient kingdom mayn't be sully'd with so notorious a mistake
shall only say in answer to this paragraph that altho your ancestors were never sparing of their blood in defending their country nay oftimes in making reprizal when they could conveniently yet must put you in mind that they were far better pleas'd with enjoying themselves in their old caledonian mountains than you are now with both hills and plains and dare say they had such a value for their native blood that they would not have been guilty of sending so many innocent and worthy gentlemen like sheep to the slaughter or spanish mines so far from home on such an april errand

tis both hard and unaccountable that this gentleman who sets up for your champion should use the english nation so familiarly and take such liberty not only of frightning them into an ague but to bully a great general who was never hitherto known to be daunted by more formidable giants than the quixots of your company
he honest gentleman mean'd no harm at the granting of the octroy for tis to be believed that he could

scarce hear what was whisper'd to him for the noise of the namure guns
and as for this project of yours to darien dare be positive that he knew nothing of the matter till it was five or six months done and then he had it from other hands
if your colony has left darien for reasons not as yet publick to the world tis your fault right worshipful gentlemen in undertaking to manage a project you so little understood and not of the english nation whose interest it is to advance and preserve their own colonies and to keep them from being render'd desolate by the clandestine artisices of yours who industriously and tacitely spread their declarations over all the english islands and plantations making use of the king of great britain's name to give the more authority to the thing and by these indirect manifesto's such prosits or rather plunders were insinuated that if the government of england had not taken early measures to prevent the ill consequences tis to be question'd whether the greatest part of the english had not e'er now quitted their settlements and been decoy'd into your colony under a cover'd notion that you had a patent from the king to pick a quarrel with the spaniard and to devide the spoil of mexico and peru amongst the servants and adventures of the company
this project and settlement you know was so secretly carried on that it was not known to england till the same wind that brought the news likewise inform'd the nation that the scots were march'd over to panama the chief city on the isthmus of darien and the of all the spanish
riches on the and had planted eighty guns against it
these proceedings were enough to startle this nation who had heard of no war with spain and who had no great reason to suffer their own subjects to desert their plantations to advance the scotch colony in their own wrong
as for this nation's curing into a war with the spaniard on the score of your company who besides their loss of trade must throw away more english pounds thrice over than there's scotch in your capital stock i'll leave it to any man of half an ounce of politicks to find out the jest on't save this author of your colony's defence

as for these ridiculous and bugbear stories which both you and your champion insinuate viz that if the scots should lose or be expell'd out of darien the french will certainly possess themselves of it
this story is so far vain that the french have another game to play at present with spain and if they had any such inclination that way they know that coast far better than the scots

and might have secur'd carthagena when they had it in their power and a legal title to it by their arms in the time of a declar'd war which fortification is as far before your fort st andrew or any thing that can be made of it as dunkirk is before deale
but still if france or holland had any such design as you would make the world believe why mayn't they still go sit down within a league of either side of your colony with as good a title as yours since you will coop the spaniard up within his wall'd towns and garrisons
but to leave this unnecessary and proceed to the oblique threatnings wherewith he frightens king william to wit the fate of those princes who blemish'd and were unworthy to wear the imperial crown of your nation i'll espouse his majesty's cause no further than to be confirm'd that he has been ill serv'd by some persons and am of opinion that he does not merit one half of this ill language at their hands
further dare say so much in his behalf by what has past already that the scots crown will receive no blemish or disreputation by his wearing of it altho he does not think it either sit or just to countenance an indirect action of any of his subjects

by the beacons which your author sets up to scare him to wit of the two baliols of james the first and william the first any man without the help of spectacles may plainly perceive that he sticks at nothing to advance his cause either by wresting or perverting the truth of the history by reason there can be no parity in the example between the several cases of these dead kings whom he now brings on the stage and king william nor is there any colour of allusion to introduce them here for
for the truth of the story runs thus after the death of alexander the third ten or a dozen relations of the royal family standing competitors for the scots crown it was agreed on by the different parties to prevent the effusion of blood that the trial of their several claims should be referr'd to edward the first of england
edward accepting the office came to berwick then a scots town where after a long time spent in canvassing the several titles he found bruce baliol and cummin stand fairest for it
to make a long tale short he now found it in his power to accomplish that which his predecessors struggl'd for for some hundred years before to wit a submission of the scots crown to that of england
he felt bruce pulse but it did not beat to his mind then he sounded baliol who had more english blood in him by half than scotch who easily

condescended to his terms
edward declares john baliol king of the scots and the scots nobility having swore allegiance to him in his presence proceeded to his coronation
that being over the new scots king with his nobility came to king edward to thank him for his civility at newcastle where having been splendidly regaled for some time and the english king being to set out for london john baliol with his train of nobles came in a full body to kiss his royal fist where on a suddain king baliol claps down on his knee and swore fealty to edward as his sovereign lord and to hold the scots crown for ever of him and his successors kings of england
baliol having ended this ceremony pointed to his subjects to follow his example which being needless to dispute on that ground no body stumbl'd at it save a peevish old gentleman by name douglass who was caged up for the remainder of his life for want of good manners
baliol and his nobility march'd home to scotland as chearfully as half a dozen citizens wives return to their husbands after they have been decoy'd into a ramble and kiss'd by strange fellows and they being all alike scabby made no words on't for some years and perhaps had not then if a rash sentence had not been pass'd by baliol in his own court in prejudice of a certain thane or earl who thinking himself

injur'd appeal'd to edward as sovereign lord king edward being willing to show his grandeur summon'd baliol up to london and being seated on a throne in his court of judicature his fellow king had the honour to set by him till such time as the tryal came on and then he was oblig'd to step down to the and plead for himself
the gentleman had got so much scotch blood in him by his three years government of that kingdom that he stomach'd the disgrace and could not tell how to digest it till he went home and consulted his nobility who were all alike tardy with himself it was soon agreed on to bid edward defiance declaring that their king and they were only trick'd into their submission by his foul artifice
both nations arm'd but edward got the better on't for having overrun scotland and made them once or twice swear heartily anew and having caught john baliol by the neck would never afterwards trust him with such an office but kept him prisoner at london for many years till at the intercession of the pope and french king his imprisonment was enlarg'd to france where he died a quondam king

now whether this fate of john baliol has any relation to what your author designs since tis plain that edward both made and unmade him and not the scots refer it back to himself

to reconcile
as for the other baliol by name edward and son to this john he finding that robert bruce was the second time dead came from france to england and there having edward the third's leave to raise what men he could to seat himself on his father's old throne found voluntiers enough who were the relations of those who were foil'd at bannocksburn and with those and a few of king edward's ships he lands in the heart of scotland and set young david bruce crown on his own head without asking the scots leave and kept it till dvid with the assistance of his the french king took it from him again
neither can see the paralel in this with king william case for edward baliol took the crown at his own hand nolens volens whereas king william had it press'd upon his head by the unanimous consent of the scots nation
as for the other two examples of james and william the first what they did while it was their misfortune to be prisoners in england could not stand in law neither did ever hear that after their freedom and restauration to their dignities their scots subjects did ever reckon it to them for sin

but as there's no great advantage or credit to be purchased by ripping up such old sores so am willing to leave tracing this gentleman's

evidences and rather take things on his own authority than foul paper about it
mean while i'll be as impertinent as he is with his earl of strafford and some others and acquaint you with something that may be nearer the case
it has been observ'd in scotland in the course of several ages that it hath been ever fatal to families when they became so powerful as to swell beyond their proportion witness that of the cummins in robert bruce reign the greatest that ever has been in scotland witness that of the gouries of a latter date and if should add that of a latter family within the reach of our memory which might have reasonably been reckon'd in the same class had it not been for the happy accident of the revolution cannot be far mistaken
say most of these gentlemen being too great for subjects lost themselves with jearus in their flight some got iron crowns and others halters but that which was more tragical their whole families and dependants were hung up like haddocks to dry in the sun that they might never afterwards rise in judgment
heartily wish there may no such examples happen in our age and that no suspected persons sit so close to the machine of your colony nor wind up its spring further than it will go least it should snap and the ingineers get o'er the fingers end
being sensible that have trespass'd in the epidemical crime of my by swelling my dedication beyond its proportion and perhaps said more than some persons care to hear i'll proceed to the reasons why the gentlemen of the colony have dropt off by degrees praying that the same may serve if it be true that the whole body has follow'd their example as likewise that you mayn't hang those two poor innocent gentlemen mr montgomry and mr jollie late councellors of your colony whom you have been pleas'd to find guilty of a design to desert caledonia and run away with one of your frigats
and altho cannot profess my self a friend to your project nor to your way of managing of it yet declare that the prosperity of the ancient kingdom as likewise that a true sense of your mismanagement of that great octroy be deeply ingrafted in every scots man's heart is the hearty wish and prayer of right worshipful phil
scot
a defence of the scots abdicating darien

prejudice being apt to byass a man's pen the pillars of the scotch company will not stick to taint me with it
that mayn't deceive you don't profess my self their friend having the same reason or perhaps more as those skelletons who have narrowly escap'd the kingdom of heaven and are starv'd to death
nevertheless declare that will curb my sentiments so far as to keep my self close to the matter of fact giving an impartial account

of the procedure of that company and of the indirect artifices they made use of to decoy a great many honest gentlemen and other brave fellows into their service and how they left them in the lurtch expos'd to famine and the spanish mines and if deviate in any particular passage from the truth lay my self fairly open to the fiercest steel'd pen of the company who no doubt will endeavour to vindicate them and stifle my credit
all the favour ask is that they give me fair play stick close to the subject and bring better authority for what they write than what the author of the colony's defence hath offer'd to disprove the spaniards title to the isthmus of darien and to advance that of the scotch company
william paterson the author of this project and penman as it it is shrewdly guess'd of the octroy came from scotland in his younger years with a pack on his back whereof the print may be seen if he be alive having travell'd this country some years he seated himself under the wing of a warm widow near oxford where finding that preaching was an easier trade than his own soon found himself gifted with an anadab spirit
prophets being generally despis'd at home he went on the propoganda side
account to the

and was one of those who settled the island of providence a second time but meeting some hardships and ill luck there to wit a governour being impos'd on them by the king of england which his conscience could not admit of the property of their constitutions was alter'd and they could no longer a free port or sanctuary for buccaneers pyrates and such vermin who had most need of being reclaim'd into the church this disappointment oblig'd praedicant paterson to shake the dust from off his shooes and leave that island under his anathema
he return'd to europe some twelve years ago with his head full of projects having all the atchievements of sir henry morgan batt sharp and the buccaneers in his budget he endeavour'd to make a market of his ware in holland and hamburgh but without any success he went afterwards to berlin open'd his pack there and had almost caught the elector of brandenburgh in his noose but that miscarry'd too he likewise imparted the same project to mr secretary blathwait but still with the same success

meeting thus with so many discouragements in these several countries he let his project sleep for some years and pitch'd his tent at london where matter is never wanting to exercise plodding heads
his former

wife being at rest as well as his project he wanted a help that was meet for him and not being very nice went no further than the a widow in whom he afterwards carry'd to the isthmus of darien and at her first landing thrust her about seven foot under ground to make the possession de facto of new caledonia more authentick
while he sojourn'd in london he found employment for his head and like a true quack boggl'd at nothing that offer'd it self to his thought
he was concern'd in the hampstead and had an original hand in the project of the bank of england but being oblig'd as he says himself to communicate his thoughts to some eminent men who were more able to carry it on they bubbl'd him out of the premium and the glory of the project
the man thinking himself ill us'd by the managers of the bank of england study'd how to be up with them and in opposition to it he applies himself to the project of the orphans bank where he was afterwards sometime a director but that missing of the by reason of the clipp'd money and he meeting with some disgrace there too was resolv'd at once to be even with the body of the nation

thus discontented and uneasie in his mind he rous'd up his darien genius and

having vampt it up with some new light he had purchas'd by conversing with dampier he marches bag and baggage to the ancient kingdom where it met with such encouragement at first sight that johnston or if you will tweddale act was viis modis conceiv'd and born in a trice
at this time and for some months afterwards paterson had more respect paid him than his majesty's high commissioner and happy was he or she that had the favour of a quarter of an hours conversation with this blessed man when he appear'd in publick he look'd with a head so full of business and care as if he had atlas his burthen on his back and if a man had a fancy to be reputed wise the first step he was to make was to mimick paterson fiz nay some persons had such a conceit of the miracles he could perform that they began to talk of an engine to give the island a half and to set the orkneys where the islands of scilly stand

but to proceed to the cream of the story you are to understand that esquire paterson for at his arrival in scotland he acquir'd or assum'd an english title brought a couple of tutors or nurses along with him who pass'd for partners in the project tho in effect a couple of subtle youths whose office was to put paterson creud and indigested notions into form
one of these was a walloon by birth whose native name was le

serrurier and his english one james smith
he was master of most of the european languages and particularly of the english
he formerly acted as secretary to the fam'd italian prince who put so many tricks on the hollanders with his philosophers stone but at this juncture he pass'd for a considerable london merchant
the others name was daniel lodge born of yorkshire parents in leith in scotland per accident bred a merchant in holland but crack'd and turn'd to his shifts in england
this was a pleasant facetious fellow knew the world exactly and acted his part in this to a miracle
so much have offer'd by way of preliminary that you may have a glimpse of these dark pillars by which the scotch company was to be lighted down into the spanish or darien mines and over that isthmus to the phillipin islands california china and to japan it they could turn dutch men

the companies act being now touch'd with the royal scepter and for the more dispatch pass'd thro the seals per saltum they were empower'd by virtue of a necessary clause thereof to take in foreign subscriptions to a lesser half of the capital stock so that the main stress of the project lay in fingering this money
the three projectors frankly engag'd to use their interest with their correspondents and friends in england

holland and in the hans towns for at least in consideration of which and of the acquisition and in token of their gratitude for the project the company was to give the triumvirate so to work all hands went

there being three different parties in england jarring at that time about the india trade and the old company having got the better on't it was easie to draw a great many of the into the scotch companies net nay the subscriptions came in so quick that he was the happiest man that could get his name first down in their books for paterson preach'd up only an india trade here in england taking no notice of darien but to some select heads that were able to bear it when once the mony was in scotl they knew how to dispose of it
to be short they had now more money in their view than they knew what to do withal if the house of commons had not baulk'd them and reprimanded the subjects of england for their foolery
the companies books were cary'd home with abundance of secrecy and care tho they had as good left them behind there having been never a groat of the english money paid in as yet
the projectors follow'd them as the sons of levi did the ark in old times and when they came to scotland their chief business was to preach up the vast advantages which the house of commons foresaw

to acreu to the scotch company and nation
by this octroy and trade and to back their sermons with the greater authority the commons address to the king was printed and reprinted at edinburgh but not a syllable of the king's answer mention'd which confirm'd the whole country of the riches they were like to be surfeited with by this act and trade
to be short they came in shoals from all corners of the kingdom to edinburgh rich poor blind and lame to lodge their subscriptions in the company's house and to have a glimpse of the man paterson who satisfy'd them as fast as they came that altho they sign'd such a sum for fashion's sake to give the company more reputation abroad yet the quarter part would only be demanded there being no occasion for any more and that they could not lie out of the use of their money above months or years at most which by that time and the old cant of god's blessing would fetch good returns and large dividends

the companies books had not been long open'd in edinburgh before was sign'd when it will be all paid in the lord of hosts knows and it now being high time to shut the books there and go where the money lay to wit the in holland and the hans towns the projectors were consulted about it
the result of which was

that they might not act precipitately in this affair it was necessary they should make some real show of their resolution and forwardness by sending a couple of fit persons over to amsterdam and hamburgh to build half a dozen of stout ships of guns apiece that by laying out their money in the dutch country the dutchmen might be prepossess'd with a kind opinion of the company and thereby make it appear how willing they were to extend the warm rays of their octroy to people who deserv'd it better than their ungreatful neighbours
some warm debates happen'd on this occassion what two persons should be entrusted with this mighty affair for by reason the kirk and was equally in the stock both parties endeavour'd to imploy their own instruments
there were several meetings on this affair and it was at amicably concluded that alexander stevenson late or of edinburgh a zealous and sayer and capt james gibson merchant and malignant of glasco should be the delegates

the next material thing that came in course was to lodge a stock of cash in london to answer their delegates necessary occasions abroad the sum agreed on was either or but what man to entrust with this sum that was fed on english beef and puddin was another hesitation
the

oracle paterson being consulted herein sagely responded that his brother smith business requiring him to go and remain for some time at london he expecting some ships home from carolina and wherein he had large effects he was of opinion that they could not lodge it safer than in his hands
smith returns to london and having got the gelt in his sack never broke his rest afterwards about the project
the company at the same time had substituted two other cashiers abroad to wit mr francis stratford mechant at hamburgh now governour of that company and alexander hendersson alias archbisshop at amsterdam who were to draw from smith bank as the delegates had occasion

this walloon banker and italian secretary answer'd the bills punctually till a better half of the money was extracted about which time finding the company baulk'd of the holland as well as english subscriptions he thought it necessary to hold his hand and was passive in suffering a bill of of stratford drawn on him to be protested at london
shall leave him here for sometime that may bring the rest along with me and only tell you that smith now finding himself master but of of the companies cash and not sure that he shouldever see so much of it again and looking on this as little more than his quota for the project

and subscriptions altho the latter happen'd to fail not through any fault or neglect of him but by the frowns of the house of commons in england and holland by some surly dutch men proprietors in the east and companies and lords of amsterdam he thought the premium wrought for sufficiently and that it was but just he should pay himself since his intention was as honest as if it had succeeded and if he had anything over his neat share it was convenient to hold it fast to enable him to go to law the easier with the company

the company bit their lips but endeavour'd to keep it hush for some time that the world might not perceive how they were deservedly bubbl'd
smith knowing their circumstances never went out of the way for or months afterwards and then being sensible that if once the compan
ships were fail'd there would be no great occasion to pay him any more civilities to keep the project secret and consequently he must expect the company would be on his back
on these considerations he was on the wing for his own country and was got so far on his journey as gravesend when as luck would had it he was nabb'd with a capio te at the companies instance
some of his own and wife's relations were in the coach with him to see him to dover when this accident happen'd but he on this occasion compos'd himself with more sedateness of mind than bousfliers did at namure and being unwilling to part with the money so dearly earn'd bespoke

lodgings in the marshalsea till on the late revolution of that sanctuary the marshal and he went off together on a new project to carolina
daniel lodge was at edinburgh when the first bill was protested and had his papers seiz'd and carry'd to the campanies office and a couple of centries set over himself but he being yorkshire blood scotch born and dutch bred it was not easie to fasten any thing on him
paterson was at hamburgh on the embassie when he heard of the misfortune of stratford bill but all the mends he could make was to sigh and look dull
nevertheless it was observable that altho paterson rail'd at smith behind his back there was never an ill word between them when they met for you are to understand that smith was one of the companies commissioners in holland and hamburgh about the time he suffer'd the bill to be protested in london
but to return to the setting out of this embassie stevenson and gibson being for some time gone over the water to build ships and beat the way for subscriptions the next step was to chuse fit persons to follow and manage this point
five such were appointed by name of the committee of foreign trade who were cloath'd with an ample commission from the company to take subscriptions abroad to appoint factors to controul the foresaid two legates to provide officers and seamen and in a word to do what they thought necessary for the company's service
paterson and smith were the first scotch merchant of london the third
the laird of gleneagles for the church and colonel john erskin governour of sterling and darling of the kirk made up the quorum the last two being both men of honour and worth but altogether strangers to trade
two of these were order'd to holland directly from scotland and gleneagles was to pass by london where he was to do some business and take smith and the other in his way
gleneagles having arriv'd at london and joyn'd with the other two articled with me at moncreifs in november
by the articles of our contract was to go in the company's service from london to amsterdam or hamburgh from thence to scotland and from thence on a trading voyage to either of the indies as the company should appoint and thence back to scotland
was at the same time made tacitly to believe that was to go to the east indies and that the ships would sail next march at farthest
the encouragement if had been candidly dealt with and honestly paid seem'd to be fair enough in merchants service so having order'd my affairs in england to go to india went in company of these gentlemen to amsterdam where we arrived about christmas following

here the whole committee or embassy met where having view'd their ships in that port to wit one of guns ready built and another of on the stocks they apply'd themselves to the business of subscriptions
the scheme laid down to

them was this henderson formerly mention'd a scotch man cossart a french man english man a ducth man all merchants of amsterdam were to subcribe amongst them smiths summ and were to draw in there friends and correspondents for as much as they could in consideration whereof these four were to be the company's factors in holland and to have per cent for what they bought and sold
this was easily agreed to and for their further encouragment they were invested likewise with the per cent
commission of all the money already laid out by capt gibson on the two ships canvas sails cables anchors powder guns in all above which properly was gibson right by his commission from the company
this was the first honest step they made by vertue of their controuling power

these new dutch factors ply'd their friends all over holland who generally for some time before were mightily taken with the scotch
east india trade their exemption from duties for years and tickled with the conceit that they should be sharers in it
but through an ugly accident which happen'd in camphire at paterson and the collonels landing the

whole mess of the companies pottage was in danger of being miscook
the story runs thus these gentlemen had a rough and tedious passage from scotland and it seems the skipper had not laid in provisions for his passengers over plentifully which was the occasion that paterson at his landing in camphire and being welcom'd and entertain'd by one panton a merchant there tasted more freely of the creature then he us'd to do for he always set up for a which panton perceiving ply'd him warmly and took the liberty of pumping him
paterson's tongue running glib with the hollands cannal water on the eloginm's of the octroy happen'd to babble out a secret of the company viz that their act empower'd them to give commissions to any kind of people without asking their nation to trade to the indies under scots colours and that such people might dispose of their india goods where they pleas'd providing they made a sham entry in scotland
and if the company should agree to take per cen for the goods such ships as traded with their commission were able to undersel the english and dutch full per cent
panton was glad of the news improv'd the story amongst his friends who design'd to sign in the companies

books and these run now on this commission for the per cent finding it a safer way of trading then by putting their money in the companies bottom neither would they of zealand ever afterwards enter on any other terms

we were no sooner come to amsterdam then we met with this story fresh in the there
it was too late for paterson to eat in his words so that all the salvo we could make to dash the story was by saying that this was the companies sho'el anchor if every thing else should fail them but that they had no occasion to make use of that power at present nor that mr paterson meant so when he spoke it
but that which gave us the dead stroke in holland just as the companies books were open'd the east and west india companies run open mouth'd to the lords of amsterdam shewing what was hatching by the scotch commissioners in their city to ruine the trade of the united provinces
the lords gave them satisfaction in the matter and made no noise of it for we were made to understand in a day or two afterwards that our subscriptions were dash'd and none to be expected there
on this occasion it was resolved in the commitee that paterson and the colonel

should forthwith proceed to hamburgh to see what could be be done there the rest being to remain in holland for some time to give the less umbrage to the hamburgh project
the hamburghers swallow'd the bait to a wish for the more opposition the english and dutch offer'd to the project confirm'd them the more that it was their interest to embrace it
the river elve on which hamburgh stands is navigable for flat bottom barges of or tuns for some
miles up into the country of germany which gives them an opportunity of serving all the north parts of that empire with goods more conveniently then the hollanders can and as they have no east india goods but what they have at second hand from england and holland or a few from denmark by joyning now with the scotch company they have a prospect of worming the hollander out of a good part of the german trade

in parenthesi must own that this part of the project was reasonable on both the scotch and hamburgher side if it had been meant as it was told but the devil on't was the hamburgers knew nothing of darien but builded altogether on ships laden with india goods whereof their

city and port was to be the receptacle and mart while paterson wanted only their money to raise forces to mexico and peru
the way being thus prepared by these two the body of the commitee receiv'd advice to repair thither at sight all things being ready for signing and sealing
and receiving orders to accompany them set out from amsterdam after we had spent three mouths there in vain and arrived at humburgh on
our affair was so generally favour'd by the burghers of this city that at our arrival we printed placaarts and fix'd them on the exchange and other publick places there intimating that the companies books were to be open'd in the commercie kamber the week following for subscriptions but they were to take notice the best jest on't that by the constitutions of the company no man could sign above sterling for himself as likewise that their books could not admit above in all

these placaarts were no sooner pasted up on the posts than pamphlets were crying up and down the streets full of ill nature and a great many sad truths advising the hamburghers to enquire further into the project before they parted

with their money lest they should never see it again
these pamphlets contain'd or sheets and were printed in french high and low dutch under the title of a letter from a friend in amsterdam to his friend in hamburgh
but the hamburghers having such a confidence in paterson phiz and smooth tongue and by the forward appearance the company made with their new ships of guns all in a row they believ'd all this stuff to be hatch'd in samaria from whence no good can be expected

but that the scriptures might be fulfill'd by the elects meeting with disappointments and crosses while they sojourn here or on the other hand that of honesty's being the best policy either you please the companies book was likewise shut up here without getting a groat of the hamburgers money although that city got near of the company's
the human reason of this disappointment if am not mistaken was as follows in the octroy there was a certain unnecessary paragraph which occasion'd a great many english and hollands speculations viz
that in case the company should be interrupted in their trade the king had ingag'd to interpose the regal authority to do them right and that at the publick charge
paterson

and the other agents of the company to magnifie their charter did insinuate in all companies that the king was to assist and defend them with his ships of war or otherwise if there was occasion and that out of his own pocket which they did not question to be english coin when at the same time the words of the act cannot bear it much less that a scots act of parliament should dispose of english ships and money
but since the scotch company would force this gloss on the text for their advantage the english traders to india made as profitable a use of it the other way for say they was it not enough that the king of great britain should pass an act in favour of his scots subjects to trade to india and exempt them from duties for years which is an evitable prejudice to the english trade since it's impossible to hinder them from sending their india goods by stealth over the border and underselling our markets by or per cent but that they should be empower'd to take in forreigners to be sharers with them in this trade and not only thereby suck the blood and marrow out of england for years but that our english ships of war for the maintenance of which great taxes and imposts are laid on our trade and

goods should defend this scotch company's trade and these foreigners who run away with the whole
these weak proceedings of paterson and the other agents with the sentiments the english had of it made the government of england send to the senate of hamburgh a caution by sir paul ricaut resident there to take care how they suffer'd their burghers to embark with private men the king's subjects under the hopes of the english protection which being to the prejudice of their own subjects could not be reasonably expected
this was the substance of the memorial given in to that senate who had never hitherto countenanc'd the committee altho the private burghers were so resolute to join
adverse fortune still attending our embassie they thought fit to steer homewards and make the best of a bad market being now fully satisfy'd that there's no other body's money to be trusted to but their own and having left me with legate stevenson to tend the ships till farther orders they set out from hamburgh in april

the report of this mournful story being made to the board in scotland they found that they had been hatching rotten

eggs for a twelvemonth but that which was still worse was sunk into dutchland on ships that were neither fit for merchants service nor war sunk in smith pocket a cargoe of all sorts of goods and materials for a plantation ready bought viz
scotch cloath pieces white ditto brown or
ditto died and strip'd
sterling searges ells men and womens shoes or pair slippers about pair mens coarse stockings pair womens ditto pair scotch hats a great quantity english bibles periwigs
some long some short campaigns spanish bobs and natural ones and truly they were all natural for being made of highlanders hair which is blanch'd with the rain and sun when they came to be open'd in the they look'd like so many of sampson fireships that he sent amongst the philistines and could be of no use to the colony if it were not to with their lime when they plaster'd the walls of their houses
this was all the merchandable cargoe save about worth of hamburgh linen and holland and to the same value of little trincums bought in holland for a guinea or indian trade and about or hogsheads of
the rest was in materials for

the colony viz hoes axes matches knives
and for the main design spare some hundreds of barrels of powder shot proportionable and about or drums
this cargoe of merchandize and materials for the colony amounted to about including per cent advance which the company charg'd on every article
so that there was about of the sunk
the remainder was towards provisions payment of the sailors and other servants of the company and discharge of the company's civil list but of this odd money above was deficient in the payments to wit some great men could not be forc'd to pay they natively thinking their countenance to the thing to be enough for their share others were sick and a great many stark dead of the project but most of them not able to raise their quota

the company's affairs looking now so they were for some time staggering in their resolutions and on this occasion it was propos'd to the board by the laird of drummellier a topping and leading man of the company and back'd by robert watson a leading man amongst the merchant directors that they should send order to their agents in holland and

hamburgh to sell off the ships and that their committee of homeward improvements should dispose of the foresaid cargoe to the best advantage and the company to make a dividend of the product amongst the proprietors of the stock
this proposal was rejected as inglorious and they being now in utrumque parati were resolv'd seu varsare dolos and that their servants but not themselves should be the victims to the certae occumbere morti
from this minute they fixt their resolutions that since their ships were built the provisions cargoe and other necessaries already provided they should not look back but equip for sea with all expedition if they perish there or the project miscarry they could shew the world that they drove the nail so far as it would go and at last shift the miscarriage from off themselves
and to satisfie the world that their despair was evident at the signing of the company's last instructions to the colony this drummellier would have it added in the postscript as a benediction that they should get money honestly if they could but be sure to get it and if they came home without it then the devil get them all

by the sequel of the story the reader

may judge whether they did not put this resolution into practice
after the embassie or committee of foreign trade left hamburgh nothing remarkable past there save that after mr stratford had given them a splendid entertainment for their foy they went off without bidding him kiss believing that all these dishes were a pig of their own sow left instructions behind them that he should not act any longer as the company's cashier
whether this was the true reason of his being laid aside or that of his original sin cannot resolve you but this know that he gave them credit at their first appearance in hamburgh indented with the builder of the four ships with the ropemakers blacksmiths and other artificers to furnish the company and bound himself for performance of the several contracts and at last he was oblig'd to arrest the same ships as they were sitting out for flemish that being the ballance of his accompts and they lay in limbo a fortnight or three weeks before this money could be paid

we sail'd with two of these ships viz the caledonia and st andrew from the river of hamburgh the of november
having left the other two behind us ready launch'd and lying to rot in the ouse

and arriv'd in leith road on the to the no small joy of the proprietors of the stock two thirds of whom firmly believ'd for six months that all was cheat and that there was no such ships in rerum natura

about the same time the of guns and the unicorn of were fallen down from amsterdam to the texel in order to joyn us that we might make our parade the more splendid in leith road
these ships you must know had their complement of men bore on them for several months before as if they had been ready to sail but archbishop henderson their trusty friend and agent having about due to him and partners did not think it discreet to let both ships go till he had the money in his pocket several kind epistles and civil words past between the company and him on this occasion but to no material purpose for he was apprehensive that if once they got the ships in scotland his money might be like butter in the black dog's hauce or that they might detain so much of it as came to the quota of his and partners subscriptions which he and they had no inclination to
on these considerations the archbishop sent home the unicorn and brought the company's back to the meridian of

amsterdam where she being frozen up for that season was oblig'd to lie till she thaw'd and for some months afterwards till he had his dutch gilt again
and indeed think the accident was very lucky for besides the honour which the company purchas'd by entertaining the czar of moscovy aboard while she lay at the pales of amsterdam if she had gone to the she might have set there and never risen again and so drummellier would have been disappointed of his dividend

the hamburgher ships and the unicorn being arriv'd at leith it was resolv'd to carry them up the fryth till the hardest of the winter was over but the seamen a great part of whom had been or months in the service and as void of faith as money would not move an inch till they were paid altho several of the directors came aboard to interpose their authority
this oblig'd a certain committee to be appointted for their payment who brought down the money to leith and endeavouring to show themselves good husbands for the company pinch'd may be or shillings out of each man's wages not for dammages for there was no goods which oblig'd the sailors to give them a hearty curse to their faces so soon as they had got the money in their hats
all that

was sav'd in the caledonia by this management was within and when told little blackwood my sentiments of it at the he reply'd that it was no matter every little makes a mickle and the company had need to save all they can
the consequence of this was that when the company had occasion to fit out their ships in the spring none of these sailors that were worth the hanging would list themselves and we were oblig'd to take tag rag and bobtail and such as no skipper in the fryth would eatertain
the company indeed depended on their who were discharg'd of the english service on the peace but they were disappointed for none of them would leave old england
so that when we came to sea we were so feebly mann'd altho we had eaters enough that if it had not been for the land officers and their men am satisfy'd that our ships had run away with us

in july following the ships being ready to sail the were paid off and for their farther encouragement receiv'd months pay advance as for the rest those who are alive must catch it if they can tho it may be guess'd what they have to trust to by the defences which the company makes at this time in in an

action of sea wages they are sued for
to wit that the company transfer'd their ships men and cargo over to the collonie that they are now two distinct societies that what wages were due by the company were paid before the ships went from scotland and altho the company advanc'd the foresaid two months pay yet it was not on their own account but lent to the collonie
this is a pretty honest evasion of the company to cheat so many poor men out of their wages don't know what success such defences will meet with in their own courts but they are now rejected in doctors commons and the money order'd to be brought into the court

but before go any further i'll give you a clearer view of this transfer
the company having laid out a round summ of money on this expedition thought the most probable way of seeing it again was to charge the collonie with it to let them improve it the best way they could and pay the company certain parcels of it at such and such terms
they valu'd these three ships and cargo with the two tenders including the provisions and mens wages they had already paid at for which they took the councils bond to be paid as aforesaid
they

were likewise to have certain shares in the mines minerals and to be free of duties in the collonies ports whereas strangers were to pay per cent which was to be apply'd to the maintenance of the collonies forts and other necessary uses
these gentlemen who gave their joynt bond for this were not worth so many english pence and the transfer was so clandestinely carried on that if it had been known to the or those who expected wages there had not one soul of them gone in the service
and dare be positive that when we arriv'd in darien this transfer was such a secret that it was not known to ten men besides the councellors

the seamen being thus paid by the company what was due to them with the two months advance were made believe that when once these landmen were set ashore they were to proceed on a trading voyage and return to scotland to be paid wherewith they were well enough satisfy'd
the landmen were still in worse circumstances for they had no pay nor none to trust to only the hopes they were faten'd with of picking the gold off the leaves of the trees which few of them doubted of that went on that foot
for the more formality of the thing and to make it of a greater value

there was a kind of indenture or contract between the company and these landmen
the soldiers were not to go under that denomination but that of planters
the officers of them had been captains in flanders and the other subalterns were term'd and assistants
the true mystery of their cramp names lay here if am not mistaken the octroy empower'd the company to list and entertain soldiers for the service of their collonies and to exercise martial discipline but at the same time what souldiers they listed in scotland must be with the privy councils leave first obtain'd
at the listing and enrolling of these the company thought it in vain to ask the council that savour for some weighty reasons which shall not offer here so took their own way of christ'ning them designing at the same time to make them answer the same ends when once they got them between the tropicks and in the mean time it was not necessary that these land officers or planting soldiers should know the secret of their infirmity
must tell you that pennycook and some more of the council were so ignorant of it that if it had not been for one who was none of their number they had hang'd up some of the at sea to try their hand

and after we had been a while in the collony and the poor men so starv'd that they were oblig'd to desert to any body that could fill their bellies some or of these were brought back by a party and since they found they could not hang them without running the hazard of being hang'd themselves for it afterwards they chain'd great weights of iron to their leggs and condemn'd them for a certain number of years to slavery
these actings were as unlegal as the other for if by the constitutions of the collony their port be free and if these men be planters by the indenture or contract made with the company they are freemen and not lyable to the lash of martial discipline

the terms of these indentures run thus that the planters should be mantain'd by the company three years and what ground they clear'd in that time should be dispos'd of by the colony as they should think fit allowing acres to each planter with a house in the capital city of foot square acres to each officer with a house proportionable
and to set the greater value on that rich land the councellors themselves by the constitutions could not have above three portions to wit acres
these poor deluded fellows had better sold themselves for the time in some of the english

or french plantations and have got or by the bargain without either running the hazard of starving or of the spanish mines
and altho there had been no danger of either yet what could a naked man make of this acres of ground or of at the three years end if it were not to sow potatoes maez and plantains and live as adam did
this is all the encouragement these gentlemen and planters had to trust to and altho most or all the officers had been listed or months before they were ship'd aboard yet they had not a farthing allow'd them for their subsistance but what the captains or overseers could pinch out of their companies neither could that be much for their planters were allow'd but a day for their subsistance from the date of their listing to their going on board indeed about a month before we sail'd upon a certain occasion of the land officers grumbling the directors out of their benevolence or rather to stop their mouths order'd for each captain with a subscription of in the capital stock which was only gift and for the subalterns in proportion which generous gratuity made all things easie
the contract or charter party between the company and council was penn'd before the councellors were created but that signify'd little for these candidates would scarce have stuck at the terms tho they had been harder
but to tell you the truth they were to seek for persons fit for that purpose and were glad to take such as they could get
by the constitutions a greed on by rozy mackenzie and the company seven councellors were to be created before the ships sail'd from scotland and these were to be invested with a power to assume to the number of six more as they should see occasion
have reason to believe that the design of leaving these six chairs vacant was for the encouragement of such english or french men of substance as should come in and joyn them from the west india plantations

to give you the characters at large of these councellors would be tedious wherefore desire you may accept of this in short

had almost forgot to tell you of our clergy with whom ought in good

manners to have begun
two ministers with a to take up the psalm were commission'd by the general assembly with full instructions suppose to dispose of the bibles among the indians
one of these was an extraordinary good man but he ow'd his education to the army in flanders where the kirk rust was rubb'd off him
the other was young headstrong as infallible as his holiness sawcy and as impertinent as the moderator himself
they thought to have establisht the scotch kirk discipline in america but having past the tropick of cancer they could find such a sensible alteration in our men nay in the major himself by the influence of that zone that they began to dispair of it and their being quite broke at the sight of that dear land of promise they just lookt upon it and so were gather'd to their fathers
they were not much miss't indeed for the only time we had oceasion for the priestly office was the marriage of paterson wifes maid after her belly had been a third up and then her master happening to be praeses or high priest for the week celebrated it in as much form or perhaps more than if it had been done in a scotch kirk

but before leave europe altogether must tell you one passage more which was a secret to a great part of the court of directors when we left scotland it being manag'd only by the private committee and or more
the story runs thus the companyes or rather private committees agents at london had been for some time in terms with lionel wafer to bring him into the service they had no positive instructions to agree with him at first but only to sound him as to the particulars of the country of darien
wafer it seems was in terms with some private merchants of london about sending a vessel thither for nicaragua wood to which he was to pilot them and about the same time he was putting his journals into the press
pennycook before he left london went with mr fletcher a scotch gentleman and some others designedly to discourse this wafer and having treated him at pontacks satisfy'd themselves of his capacity to serve the company they advis'd him not to be hasty in publishing his book or at least till he heard further from scotland
there was a collection of some guineas amongst these gentlemen for wafer the better to back their advice
when pennycook arriv'd in scotland he acquainted the private

committee with his sentiments of wafer on which they wrote for mr fletcher by the next post to secure him for the companies service and to make the easiest bargain he could
mr wafer had stood for some months at but now mr fletcher being in earnest with him he agreed on the following terms

he was to serve the company for the space of years in their expedition for which the company was to pay him whereof ready down

he was forthwith to proceed to edinburgh and there to answer such questions as the private committee or committee of trade should ask him

in consideration of guineas more which hethen received in hand he was to put a stop to the publishing his book for the space of a month and when he came to edinburgh if the company and he could not come to terms for the suppressing it altogether then he was either at liberty to go in their service for the foresaid or to return to england which he pleas'd

you may easily perceive something mystical in the wording of these articles whereby the company might shake their neck out of their noose but that mr fletcher mean't it so will not say but am rather willing to believe he was sincere and ignorant of the companies design on him

mr wafer pursuant to the contract having order'd his affairs in england for his voyage to darien took post for scotland and on the road past by the name of brown by the committees direction
he was stopt at haddinton miles short of edinburgh by mr pennycook who was order'd to lodge him at mr fletcher house about miles wide of that road and there he was to stay till the committee should come to him least by his going into edinburgh he should be seen by paterson or lodge who at this time were kept in the dark as to the companies resolutions or by any other person that might know him
the private committee came to him next day and having enter'd on business askt him first if he had order'd his affairs so in england that he needed not return
he answered that he had and

was ready to go abroad at hours warning to this they reply'd that it was very well tho'by the sequel of the story you'll find it none of their meaning
during the first or days conferences the subject of the discourse was darien of which he unbossom'd himself freely
and for their further incouragement he ingaged to lead them to a treasure of nicaragua wood whereof men could cut down so much in six months as should defray the whole charge of the expeditinn which if he did not perform he should forfeit his title to the premium agreed on
the gentlement were curious in informing themselves whereabouts this treasure was whither it was near the sea or any river whence it could be easily shipt aboard
wafer not suspecting any design upon him by persons of so noted characters resolv'd them in every particular and pointed out the very spot of ground where it grows with the bearings and distance of it from golden island
they now thinking themselves of the treasure and sufficiently instructed as to the country had no more occasion for wafer and believ'd that the pilotage might be sav'd to help to fetch up smith summ
next night he has brought into edinburgh under pretence of a nearer communication and was lodg'd in a private cell near the companies office three pair of stairs high where he could scarce distinguish between sun light and moon light and here he was oblig'd to keep close least by being seen abroad the project should take air
wafer was well enough pleas'd with his confinement having still the in view but as there's no certainty in sublunary things so the pilot mist of his mark for in a day or two afterwards some gentlement of the committee came to him and with abundance of concern made him understand that the project had taken wind in england that admiral bembo was lying with a squadnon at spithead to wait their motion and that it was resolv'd that very morning in the secret committee to alter their darien project
wafer being somewhat daunted at the news had but little to say to the matter and these gentlemen to blind him the more ask'd him several questions about the rivers of platte and amazones both leagues wide of darien and whether he could be serviceable to them that way to which he answered no
thus they parted from him shewing a great concern for their own disappointment as well as his telling him withal that since they could not go in his darien project they would think of a gratuity sit for him which he might expect that evening

this gratuity was the sum of twenty guineas which he receiv'd by the hand of mr pennycook and suppose he was now at liberty to print his book for think he was never so much as commun'd with about it
was order'd to see him out of town which gave me an opportunity of having the mournful story recapitulated whereof neither he nor at that time knew the draught
it was not necessary to enjoin wafer to conceal his scotch journey from the english his own interest obliging him to keep it hush since the greatest remedy he could expect was to be laught at
however dare say he hath acquired so little knowledge of edinburgh except what he learn'd of the company that if he were to return

to that city he could no more find the way to his lodging than the company could to the nicaragua wood notwithstanding they thought themselves so sure of it by directions
was afterwards one of those who went for several miles along the coast in search of this treasure but were oblig'd to give it o'er and in lieu of this our men were order'd to fell several kinds of strange trees which naturally grow in the colony's garden
these were squared and cut in ten foot peices for the easier stowage and were to be sent home by the first ship to see if the company's virtuoso's could find any lebanon amongst them
when they come dare say they will puzzle the general assembly to find names for them all for can scarce think that old nunkle trotted so far west to christen them

but that may now take leave of the company whom am unwilling to part with as yet if it were not for fouling too much paper and hale my home for my voyage to darien must acquaint you that about or months before we sail'd a committee was order'd for the dispatch of business viz for the victualling and sitting out of the fleet
was ordered to assist at two or three meetings of this committee with my advice in the victualling part that for some time before lying within my province and they having told me that men was the compliment they design'd for this expedition and that they must regulate the daily expence according to the store they had so as to make it hold out months this was soon done and if we had been ready to sail then the provisions might have held out according to the calculation but our masters being no witches at their craft a third of their provisions were expended before we could be ready to sail
there was none to be had in scotland and if there had there was no money to go to market the being sunk and the companies credit not worth two pence notwithstanding the glorious show our ships made from the of edinburgh
and have reason to believe that we had stuck there as well as the rising sun did in the pomposse if it had not been for some few pillars of the company who mortgag'd their estates

for or for which the company made over the two new ships at hamburgh and the rising sun at amsterdam for their security
it was not convenient to let our men know the ill state of our provisions but on the other hand there was such a noise made or our plenty and of our having a twelve months store of all kinds for men that it was like to have set us all by the ears together before we were long at sea
this management was principally due to mr robert blackwood one of that committee a little who took this part of it upon him and is now in disgrace for the same
whether he deserves it altogether himself will not say but however the company thinks it necessary he should be the sacrifice altho one half of their collars is not enough to attone for what so many brave fellows has suffered

having sail'd from leith about three days acquainted mr pennycook with my doubts as to the provisions and how necessary it was the council should be satisfied of our store before it were too late
next day he made the signal for the counsellors to repair on board and the pursers of the several ships were ordered to lay an account before them of what provisions they stood charged with
this done was ordered to calculate the whole and make a report how long the store would hold out at the usual allowance for men our compliment being thereabouts
could

not make above months and a half of any specie except of which we had full months and that at days of the week but had not above months butter and oyl to it
the council design'd to put into the orkney's to send an express to the company and give them an account of the slate of provisions but meeting with thick and bad weather in the passing of them we were obliged to go on and having calculated that store to hold out months our men were forthwith put to that sharp allowance
this occasion'd ill blood enough and was like to have got my throat cut for being the author of it
as for our drink we had not above ten tunn of beer in our navy when we left leith but in lieu thereof we were assur'd by the company that we should take in wine at madera's for which they had sent us credit on mr miles who had effects in his hands of one william arbuckles a director dut being come thither we found this to be a mistake to say no worse on't
our men now being at such short allowance and no other drink to trust to but stinking water did not know how to brook it well

the officers and gentlemen voluntiers who had brought but little money with them being in hopes that there was enough before them were obliged to sell their moveables to jack portugueese such as scarlet coats clooks and swords wherewith they purchas'd

a little wine for themselves
the senate was in the same case for they had no cash in their bank and being under such another necessity as david was when he eat the made bold with the several ships wherein was only for each ship and for each tender in case they should meet with any disaster at sea and be oblig'd to be put into a foreign port
with this money and a few they purchas'd pipes of wine and a small recruit of fresh provisions
but this would not have gone far for if it had been serv'd out but at a quarter of a pint a day to each man it would not have held out above six weeks

that you may tast a little of our provisions as well as you must know that our was the best if there had been a proportion of butter or oyl to it
our beef was fourths irish and the rest scotch both alike sit for a long voyage
there was about a fifth part of the irish the rest grass beef and the whole about months in salt
as for our bread weight of it was made up of damnified wheat which was bought cheap and the money of it is now in the pocket of a director whose christian name is drummellier
this bread was not sit for dogs to eat but it was a mercy we had a good many highlanders in our legion who were not used to feed on much of god's creatures that's hallowed
the pork was indifferent

good but there being no great store of it aboard we reserv'd it always for our sundays dinner
as for cheese we had none by reason suppose that only serves for concoction or to create an appetite
thus we march'd as the scots armies did in former days with their days provisions on their backs against their enemies whom if they did not meet before that term was expir'd they dispers'd and went home again
but their case and ours differ'd in some essentials these were never far from home knew what to trust to and if they happen'd to be disappointed of the enemies plunder they could make bold with their neighbours chickens while they were on the road and that never reckon'd stealing but we were sent to the back of gods elbow where we could see nothing but death starving and the spanish mines before our eyes and although our inclinations were never so strong to borrow any of our neighbours goods yet our power was always deficient

but now to proceed on our voyage and give you the remarkable occurrances of it and of our darien entertainment you are to know that we left the edinburgh fyrth on july the
and having fetch'd a turn round the orkney's we arriv'd at madera's about the last of august and staid there or days till we purchas'd the foresaid pipes of wine
here the council open'd their instructions

by which they were ordered to steer to and take possession of it in the name of the company and nation of scotland and leave a small deteachment there
this island lies to leeward of st a cruz about leagues to windward of about miles and leagues from st thomas a danish island
having made the island of st a cruz our senate order'd the unicorn and one of the tenders into st thomas to get some pilates for the main and to return to us at
while the council sat on this occasion we drove to the end of st a cruz and not being in too much hast to come to an anchor at we fetch'd a trip to windward round st a cruz which occasion'd the disappointment of our settlement for our missioners to st thomas having innocently scatter'd some words there of our crabb design the governour forthwith dispatch'd a sloop with ten men and an officer to take possession of it in the name of denmark so that at our arrival in the bay or road of we could see a large tent ashore with the king of denmark colours flying
our senate sent ashore to know the meaning of it and were made sensible that they came too late
next day the unicorn and tender arriv'd having brought with them one allison who commanded a sloop in that squadron of privateers who had landed at

and march'd over the isthmus about years ago
we were glad of such a pilot for there was no man in our fleet that had ever been on the spanish coast
we left crabb island the second of october and having met with southerly and westerly winds for weeks or a month together it was the second of november before we came to an anchor on the darien coast
we lay becalm'd a week between cartagena and cape tiburoon which is the westermost point of the gulph of darien where for want of any air but what was sulphurous our men fell down and died like rotten sheep

we came to an anchor about leagues to the northwest of cape tiburoon and altho we were close by golden island yet neither our pilate nor any person else knew the land till the indians inform'd us
the unicorn being the first ship that came to an anchor sent her boat ashore where having left an hostage with some indians who had a plantation there two canous with a few indians came on board the ships
the canou which came to the st andrew where was had captain andreas on board who was afterwards the companies and collonies landlord they were some hours aboard before we could make them understand us altho a jew who was our linguist endeavour'd it with his spanish portuguese french and dutch till once they were got drunk with our punch

and madera wine and then captain andreas with his lieutenant spoke it as fast and much better than our jew
having got their load they were not able to go ashore that night and next day we weigh'd and came into the bay within golden island which is about or miles wide and deep
and having sounded with our boats along the shore we found a lagoon on the side of this bay which runs up within the land about two miles and a half this appearing to be a good harbour for us we went into it and christened it by the name of caledonia harbour
the mouth or entry of this harbour is a large mile over and so steep too on both sides that a ship may go so near as to throw a ashore
one side of the harbour towards the sea is a vast mountain and peninsula being joyn'd to the main at the bottom of the harbour by a neck of low land about or paces over
the extream point of this peninsula which makes one side of the harbours mouth is a low and flat piece of sandy ground containing about acres and divided from the peninsula by another neck of paces over from sea to sea
this was pitch'd upon as the strongest sanctuary in case of attacks as likewise for the convenience of a battery towards the harbours mouth we christen'd this piece of ground by the name new edinburgh and the platform of guns which we made

there was call'd fort st andrew
the neck of land was cut through to let the sea encompass the new city and fort and part it from the peninsula and within the treneh a with a parapet was rais'd and a half bastion at each end
on the other side of the trench the trees were fell'd and the ground clear'd for a round to give us a fair prospect of the spaniard in case of an attack
this piece of ground was the scotch collony as for the peninsula it self it might have been fortify'd with some labour and pains but not thinking it convenient to part so few men to defend these two posts it was resolv'd by the council to stick close by this and fortify it to the
as for the opposite point on the main which makes the other side of the entry into the harbour it is a high ridge of a mountain which with a sharp or edg'd end butts into the sea and so crosly contriv'd that it would puzzle all the inginiers in europe to plant a gun on it that could do any service
so that at best this harbour is only a shelter from bad weather the platform call'd fort st andrew being of little use to defend it the ships indeed by bringing a spring on their cables and their broadsides to bear towards the mouth of the harbour might serve for so advantagious a battery as one ship within the harbour might be as good as two that came in to attack them the nature of which strength may easily be comprehended by any seafaring men

but to return to our landlord and the other indians captain andreas plantation was amongst the mountains about miles from our harbour the extent of his government was from about or miles on one side of us and golden island about miles on the other side such a portion of land being the lairdship or kingdom of these captains whom the buccaneers privateers and scotch company would have to be kings and sovereign princes
at our first landing captain andreas came down and lookt on us and seem'd to be well enough satisfy'd with his new tenants he thinking it in vain to appear otherwise for if he had muster'd his whole clan to oppose us of our men with were enough to conquer him but what his sentiment was will appear by the sequel
after that visit he did not come near us for or weeks and during this time the mighty noise of our force spreading all along that shore and the hopes we gave them of restoring them to their ancient liberty and greatness there came canous with indians from all the neighbouring parts to view us it was our interest to make them welcome so that they came daily to us without any dread and having staid till we were weary of them went home again with some little presents of beads or knives
about the same time captain ambrosio came from the westward to us with a periaga full of indians to the number of including men women and children for when they

travel they carry their whole families with them and having come within half a mile of our ships they set up a flag of truce and lay on their oars till our pinnaces went out and assur'd them that they should be safe
this ambrosio is one of their greatest captains and at present an outlaw or if you will at war with the spaniard having murder'd of them at the isle of pines sometime agoe his plantation and government is about miles to leeward of the collony and about half way between and the samballa islands
he was made very welcom staid or days and told us that we were not safe in captain andreas ground by reason he was a spanish captain and a very spaniard in his heart and although he seem'd to be well enough satisfy'd with our landing in his ground yet he was not to be trusted but came purely with a design to spy us
captain andreas absenting himself so long from the collony added to the same suspicion and our senatours being resolv'd to know more of it of their number went on a visit to his plantation and having enter'd his wigwam or house he sat still on his seat without saying one word to them or seeming to know that he ever had seen them before although he was made heartily drunk at both the times he was on board
mr pennycook and the others having met with this cold entertainment from captain andreas for they were not offer'd so much as a plantain or callabash of drink which is the usual

entertainment the indians give to their friends at their first entry came home again confirm'd of what ambrosio and the other indians had hitherto said
the next time capt ambrosio came he insisted on the same story and would needs perswade us to remove from that place and come nearer to him where we needed not apprehend any betraying design from him by reason his killing of these spaniards at the isle of pines and taking that periaga with a brass pitterara could never be forgiven by them
our council met on this occasion where it was order'd that pennycook montgomery macay and pinparton counsellors with robert drummond commander of the caledonia should go to ambrosio with the and pinnaces mann'd with and on their way to sound all the harbours along the coast
was desir'd by these gentlemen to go with them and having stopt the first night at the isle of pines leagues to leeward of the collony where captain long was riding in his majesty's ship the rupert prize we lodg'd that night on board with him
the next day we proceeded on our expedition sounding the coast where we sound some good harbours that were able to contain all the navy of england but they could not be fortify'd so as to hinder the enemy from coming in
when we arciv'd at ambrosio's little river or brook we landed and were piloted by his son captain pedro to the plantation which is about a

league from the sea and is so cunning and obscure that without a guide it is impossible for any man to find the way to it
we crost one river eleven times wading always up to the middle and believe we could have gone a nearer way if they would but they do this designedly that the path or road may not be found out by the spaniard
being arriv'd at the plantation captain ambrosio came out of his wigwam about paces and welcom'd us he had a white cotton frock on fring'd at the bottom and his court or clann behind him who were all muster'd on this occasion to the number of thirty men besides women and children they were in such frocks as ambrosio and had short lances in their hands he carry'd us into his wigwam and his wives gave every one of us a plantain and callabash of their drink which is made of indian corn and like unboil'd flummery this being all the food we got till the next day at noon we came down to our boats except a dish of mine'd meat of wild hogg wherein was about two pound of meat which serv'd to give us a tast of their finest cheer
we hung in hammocks that night in ambrosio wigwam amongst his and his son pedro wives and our men lay without round a large fire that was made for them
next morning ambrosio went out betimes with or of his men to hunt for us but there being no appearance of his return at noon and our belliers crying cupboard we did not stay to bid him fare well and his son captain pedro having us to the sea side desir'd the linguist to tell captain pennycook that his father and he expected some present for that entertainment
we had brought nothing with us at that time so told him that the next time his father came to the collony the council would thank him and give him something which afterwards was two pieces of scotch

cloth two and some pouder with a few shot wherewith he was mightily pleas'd
having return'd to the collony and a report of the expedition being made in council and the port where we were reckon'd the most secure it was resolv'd to remain there dispatch the fortification with all expedition and make the best bargain with andreas we could
on the last of november being st andrew's day it was manag'd so but how cannot resolve you that captain andreas came aboard the st andrew where was a festival on the account of the day and he being ask'd by the linguist why he was so uncivil to the councellours when they came to visit him in his plantation he answer'd that he meant no harm and that they must impute it to his ignorance of the european customs altho this tale could not come well from one that was bred among the spaniards and not to his want of
he was desir'd to sit down and share with them the linguist telling him the occasion of that feast

after dinner the great bowl of punch being set on the table the sight of which was pleasant enough to andreas the council was resolv'd to push the thing home and told him what ambrosio and the other indians said of him to which he reply'd almost verbatim as follows that he could not deny but that he was a spanish captain and had been so a long time that the reason of his shewing the collony so little countenance was by reason some

or years past the english and french landed in that very ground being or hundred in number and made them believe they were come to free them from the spanish yoke and restore them to their own country his friends and relations join'd and assisted them at the taking of sancta maria and other towns on the south sea and likewise serv'd on

board their ships with them in their south sea expeditions till at two years end they found that all their design was on the spanish plunder and having got that lest them expos'd to the cruelty of the spaniard who have cut off most of the indians thereabouts and that for several years they were oblig'd to live obscurely in the mountains as for himself and friends they were oblig'd to accept of the spaniard terms but at the same time if he thought that the collony were sincere and that their nation could protect him and this kindred he was ready to break with the spaniard and join with them
few words more were made of it the council accepted of his proser and promis'd great things enough for the nation and the secretary was order'd immediately to make out a commission for andreas
it was made on parchment with the collonies seal and a fine ribband affixt to it the tenor whereof run thus
captain andreas having desir'd protection from the collony for himself and the other indians under him the council does hereby take him and them into their protection and appoints the foresaid andreas to be one of their scots collonies captains to command all the indians that's already in his ground and to fight against and destroy the enemies of the collony of what nation soever
this commission was wrote in english and read to him by the jew in spanish and for the more solemnity of the thing the council gave him one of the jacks to wear in his canou a fuzee and a pair of pistols and a sword and fir'd guns at his inauguration
in the evening captain andreas went ashore with his flag slying and the other ensigns of his honour except the commission which found the day following cram'd into a locker of the where empty bottles lay
what the meaning of leaving his commission behind him was could not apprehend page duplicate page duplicate

but the next time he came aboard it was given him
the collony's affair continu'd thus till christmass during which time the neighbouring indian captains came to visit us to wit captain possigo young diego another pedro antonio and nicola who generally used to rail at one another behind their backs but all agreed that andreas was not to be trusted notwithstanding his new commission
ambrosio was with us during the christmass and having met with caprain andreas on board the st andrew whom he always look'd on as his mortal enemy reproach'd him with his villany by telling him that he was still a spaniard altho he took the collony's commission this occasion'd some blows between them and both parties were going to fall on if they had not been parted by our seamen
they were kept asunder till the evening and then mr pennycook persuading ambrosio to be reconcil'd to him or at least to appear so a bowl was made and the friendship made up they seem'd then to be good friends all that night till about the time that they were to go to sleep poor captain andreas either fellor was tumbl'd down the main into the hold where lighting on a spare anchor that lay there he was so bruiz'd that he gave up the ghost soon afterwards
no body could tell how this accident happen'd only two things were remarkable in it that the hatches of the hold were always lock'd down at nights by reason the sharpness of our diet made some men watch all opportunities of getting into the hold where the oatmeal and beef lay but they were fairly open this night
the other is that there was no care taken while he was aboard to bleed him or give him any thing inwardly to keep the blood fluid and from settling on the bruiz'd parts but laid him up till next day his wife and relations carry'd him double

captain or king andreas having made his exit thus his captain pedro with the interest or advice of the senate was seated on his throne and he prov'd so friendly to the collony that about days after his advancement a party of spaniards to the number of being sent to view the scots came streight to captain pedro or andreas his government desiring some of his men to pilot them to some convenient place where they might view the scots fortification and ships these indians ingaged it but advised them to lie closs for a day or two untill they view'd whether or no the coast was clear and no scots parties abroad so having posted them on the side of a small river left them and inform'd the collony of what they had done on which captain montgomery detach'd a party of a men and went round in their boats carrying these indians along with them as they were rowing up this narrow river the in lians of a sudden gave the hollow that the scots might know they were upon them but before they could fee any body by reason of the thickness of the woods the spaniards pour'd in a volley of small shot amongst them kill'd one ensign sainton with two more and wounded and then run as

fast as they could our men landed and persu'd them but caught none of them save this domingo de la rada and two more common soldiers of whom the proprietors of the have made such a noise these five or six months past
this is the ground of the companies title to the isthmus of darien and that was the bloody fight wherein so many hundreds of spaniards were kill'd and taken prisoners
our men being reduc'd to the foremention'd short allowance and wrought every day from sun to sun in felling of trees and fortifying themselves and feeing but little appearance of the riches they were told of began to be very
several deserted from the shore and some of our best men from the ships no body knew whether and eight or nine of those who were caught and brought back again confess'd that they were going in to the spaniards where they might expect more victuals and less slavery than what they had there

notwithstanding these general murmurings the council could not augment the allowance without runing the hazard of starving a month or two sooner for there's no kind of food to be had in that mountainous woody country save plantains bonnano's

potato's and indian corn which are so scarce by reason of the few natives that our men sold their new shirts to the indians for or plantains a piece which would not serve a man above three or four days and our council were oblig'd to give strict orders that no man should sell his cloaths else verily believe our men had been naked in two months after our landing
they were oblig'd to a certain animal call'd a sojour which is a small land crab that is hous'd in a shell like that of a wilk these sojours were very plentiful at our first landing but they soon fail'd and then our men eat the inner rind of the bark of great iree which was not unpleasant to the tast but it being of no nourishment and thought to be unwholesome they were discharged to eat of it
doubt not but there's plenty of fish on that coast but our company furnishing us only with a small
net made of packthread for each ship they could catch no more in a day than what serv'd the counsellors and sea captains and these nets soon fail'd too
we made a shift to make a couple of turtle nets out of the store of lines or small cord we had aboard but then we had not a vessel that was fit to go a turtling till after some

time two of the jamaico sloops who had brought and sold their cargo of provisions to the collony were hir'd by them to turtle for them these sloops staid about a month in their service till they had got so many turtle for them as by contract came to a and odd pounds and finding that there was neither money nor money's worth to be had in the collony they broke off with them and with much a do could get so much money as to satisfie them for their service
they had some dependance on the wreck of a french ship which wascast away coming out of the harbour the day before christmas she having near in doubloons and dollars on board which she had got by trading on the spanish coast but am told by some persons who are come home since came that they could not recover any thing of it by reason of the continual swell that beats on that shore
here in parenthesi was shipwrack:d had my servant drow'd and lost the few goods had with bag and baggage and if it had not been for the little money which saved had not found the way home as yet as for the gold and riches of that country heard enough but saw little of it presume if there were such store the spaniards would not have left it so expos'd

these kings or captains who came down to us might bring perhaps half an ounce or an ounce at a time with them and sell it for powder and shot and at first for a speckled shirt but there came so little of this commodity amongst us that it would be long time before a man could load his pocket with it much less a dutch built ship
what gold purchas'd there it cost me per ounce and believe brought as much of it away with me to england as most of those counsellors who are come home since notwithstanding the noise which they made of it
left the collony the of december at the same allowance as we were reduc'd to in july when we left scotland only there was an allowance of madera wine after our landing to wit an english quart to a mess being men once a week two quarts to each captain once a week of which these gentlemen made only one want and the night they got their allowance they went as merry to bed as if they had been in their winter quarters at ghent or brussels altho they were ablig'd to drink fair water for a week afterwards as for the subalterns when came off they were not allow'd one spoonful
thus you see how a men were sent by the scotch company on a blind project of getting riches for them with five or six months allowance at most no credit and a ridiculous cargo neglected by them and expos'd to famine death and the spanish mines
how the company will shake this miscariage from off themselves cannot see however will give you a sample of what they will be ready to offer in their own vindication
first their being baulkt of their foreign subscriptions made them lose time and money whereby they could not send out such a number of men and quantity of provisions as the project would have required
but who is to blame for this why should they trust to another man's purse till such time they are sure of it why did they prodigally throw away in holland and hambrough purely to make a bluster there when they could have bought as fit for their project for the third of the money and since their design was to settle a collony and forts on the north and south seas why did not they apply themselves rightly to it that which might have been honestly sav'd out of this might have carried over above men with months

provisions of every specie at good allowance
have made this appear in scotland some time ago and since to some of the greatest men in the company

the second reason they will be apt to offer is this the ships were mann'd the and listed and on board no provisions to be had in scotland while more were providing abroad these aboard still were expending besides there was no money in the nor any more to be had from the subscribers till once the ships were sail'd many being so sick of the project that they doubted whether they should ever pass the bass
if this should be allow'd to pass for current it may reasonably be ask'd whether five or six months provisions should have lasted to this time
if ever they expected to hear any more of their ships ought they not to have call'd in more money on our departure and provided provisions instantly and had ships with us by christmas or january at farthest whereas none sail'd from leith till may which was near two months after they receiv'd the collonies packet
if they pretended to be ignorant of our necessity before this packet came they had no excuse afterwards they knew our want as like wife that they had not sent a of

credit with us to any part of the world altho now when its too late they have made a fashion of doing it in newengland
the third reason they will make great use of is this that at the setling of barbadoes and several other islands as likewise the american settlements on the main the people met with a great many hardships and the like are to be expected at the beginning of all such settlements
to this answer that at such settlements the undertakers and planters know what they are going about and what to trust to which is no ways parallel with the case of the company for those being on an honest design had no more in their view than the blessings of heaven and the product of the earth and what they reap'd thereby was for their own use
on the other hand the gentlemen who went in the scotch companies service were not born to work nor did they design it when they went from their fathers houses and this the company knew full as well as they

a fourth reason they will offer is this that they sent a cargo with us which might have purchas'd provisions had it not been for the english prohibition
to this that the company having sent

us on so dark an errand where they must needs be assur'd that not only spain but the other trading nations would be in our top should not have trusted to that unless they contriv'd it designedly to pick a quarrel with those nations whose interest it was to refuse us provisions or necessaries to support our collony
as for the cargo it self refer my felf to the particulars and let any merchant be judge whether it was fitted for sale especially in the
the fuzzes were the best of the cargo but they could not be parted with the linnen was the next but have been assur'd by merchants on that worth of scorch cloath makes the commodity a drug there at any time
besides altho we had not been sent on a dark design yet we cou'd not expect to trade with jamaico our cloath and other goods are seizable there either in our bottoms or in their
sloops if the jamaico men should truck provisions with us they cannot carry our goods home with them neither can they expect to trade with the spaniard on the account of our settlement
know very well that the first sloop which brought provisions to us sold them at what rate they pleas'd and had our scotch cloath in truck at the prime cost yet they durst

not carry it to jamaico nor venture to trade with the spaniard but were oblig'd to leave it behind with captain allison the old buccaneer to whom the sloop was consign'd
lur still this reason of the prohibition will not hold water for if there had been money or market goods in the collony
the english prohibition could not have kept provisions from us
the french and dutch islands were not confin'd by this prohibition and dare say there are so many good christians at currassa that if redp and b's story of the collonies bars of silver had been true they would soon have made provisions a drug in caledonia
besides can't think that the prohibition had any influence on those four sloops who went from jamaico to the collony laden with provisions of all kinds altho two of them return'd without breaking bulk am rather apt to believe it was for want of those silver bars and gold dust which in the autum shakes off the trees there

as to the prohibition in self whereon the author of the defence stumbles so oft and would gladly found the basis of his quarral
tis believ'd that his majesty knew nothing of the collonies settlenient at darien but what he had at second hand from prints till the spanish ambassador

told him from his master that some of his majesty's scotch subjects had invaded the spanish dominions in his province of darien which he look'd upon to be contrary to the treaty of peace
if his majesty stopt the spaniards mouth for the present till he inquired into the matter and forbid his english subjects in the to have any communication with these people in darien till such time as the title were concerted he did no more than what was consonant with the constitutions and eslablishment of the english islands altho there had been no spanish complant neither could the king imagine that the company ould end out their ships on to foreign an expedition so unprovided as to depend wholly on the english plantations
and if the king sorb.d these to supply the scotch collony he did not prohibit the scotch company not scotch nation to send them what provisions or other necesiaries they thought nt
if the scotch company took most care to send out buccaneers pieces with great quantities of powder and shot and trusted to what men they could decoy from the english and french islands the defign was neither fair nor honest and it may reasonably be believ'd that both these nations would have taken measures

to bring them back again after they went
and if his majesty takes care that his plantations in the shall not be reduc'd to forrests he can't be blam'd considering the vast riches they send home to england yearly and the customs which come into his coffers when on the other hand all that the scotch company can make by such depopulations will not put one peny in his pocket these seventeen years at soonest worth the product of seventeen hogsheads of tobaccco

laying aside the spanish complaint and admit the scotch company to have a legal title to their settlement was it not reasonable that the government of england having met with the clandestine declararations which the scotch collony had spread all over the inviting them over to darien
should take suitable measures to prevent the ill consequences of the same and retain their own subjects
the declarations are notorious and must be penn'd by some body belonging to the company or collony and presume the opposite proclamation or prohibition was penn'd by some englishman who had some interest in the english plantations
tis very well known that when captain pincarton met with the misfortue of being oblig'd

to run his vessel ashore under the guns of carthagena his chief errand was to barhadoes and there to make use of the hours that's allow'd to foreigners to wood and water in doing business for the collony and leaving declarations to be spread over that island and so from thence to other english and french islands making use of the same pretence of wanting wood and water
these sinister dealings are not suffered in the collony of any nation and if the english and french governments take care to prevent such designs cannot see how they can be blaim'd tis very well known that those declarations were so kindly entertain'd all over the westindies that what with the umbrary use that was made of king william name and the hopes of spanish spoil most men who were not indu'd with real or personal estate were making ready to go over to darien nay the unthinking sort of people about the city of london on the coin'd rhodomantado news wherewith the prints were daily stuft were pleas'd and big with the project looking no farther into in than jacks gold which they natively believe every body has a right to when at the same time

the knowing part of the world is sensible that jack is the common dradge of europe and if the mines of
peru and mexico were in any other bodies hands wesh uld not get such a good account of either of these metals
by what has been already said it may easily appear whether or no these gentlemen have staid long enough in darien and whether the director of the company or they deserve most to be there at this minuet
as for my part got my belly full of the project and am now glad to see my self alive here altho left my eldest son of the first marriage behind me in calidonia

being afflicted with a mallady imaginaire for some months before came off purchas'd my liberty of the collony with difficulty enough about the same time the counsel having resolv'd to send home one of their tenders with a packet to the company and a sample of the strange woods that grow in the collonies garden thought to have got my passage in her but was disappointed by a state reason which was thus major cunningham was the chief instrument incontriving and forwarding the express and having brought his marks to bear

so far as that the vessel was carreen'd tallow'd and fitted for the voyage he was sudden'ly afflicted with my distempar and it seiz'd him so violently that on the second day of his illness he call'd a council being preses for the week and fatisfied them that he must leave them and go home to his native country for the recovery of his health
pannycook and macay smelling a rat us'd both fair and foul means to detain him but all would not do
mean while they contriv'd ways to detain the vessel till the majors preseship was out and the week following it was resolv'd in council nemine contradicente except the major to take some other way of sending home the packet and to convert the tender into a fireship the majors tallent not lying in sea engagements he could not offer much aginst the necessity of it
about the same time the french ship mention'd before happen'd to put into our harbour as like wise a hollands ship that was trading on the spanish coast and came hither for sanctuary the barlevanto fleet being on the carthagena coast the french ship was bound home to st malo and design'd to take my passage in her but the major

being possest with some frightful stories of the french captain's making an oblation of him to the governour of carthagena would not venture in her
the ship was cast away going out of the harbour in fair weather for want of wind and of her men drowned escaped narrowly in mr pennycook boat while he was forc'd to swim for his life
a jamaico sloop having brought some provisions to the collony about the same time and being bound home the mayor and took our passage in her
we left the collony the of december arriv'd in jamaico a fortnight afterward and in bristol the of march last where the major and parted he going for scotland and for london at our parting he would oblidge me to write nothing to scotland in prejudice of the darien project and promised him that he should have such liberty in telling his own story there that for the space of two months should not write concerning it directly or indirectly which promise kept religiously although as it has happen'd my silence has not been of much service to the company

was no sooner arriv'd in london than at the request of some scots persons of

great quality freely gave them a true account of affairs and my opinion of the project they had journals at the same time from the council of the collony but owned that they were better satisfi'd with my account than the journals which were design'dly dak in some essential points
my relation of darien and caledonia in england differing from that in scotland it was thought necessary for the repose of the subscribers to stifle my credit nay one of these great persons told me afterwards that he had receiv'd letters from some earls in scotland to diswade him from giving credit to my relation it being the pure effects of prejudice and that the collony wanted for nothing
two thirds of the scots nation here in town were on my top and abus'd me to my back like any beggar
this and some other harsh usage which receiv'd at the scotch companies hands oblig'd me to take this way of righting my self have no other aim by it then that their actions may be laid before the scotch world that some persons of that nation may be unblinded and see how far they have been led into a mistake

as for the spanish and scotch companies titles to the isthumes of darien on which page duplicate page duplicate page duplicate page duplicate page duplicate page duplicate

the author has foul'd six of seven sheets of paper and said so little to the purpose think it is an unnecessary dispute at present altho such a sail'd the of september
shall only rehearse to you here what told sir who was sent for in may last from scotland to court on the companies affair at his arrival in london he sent a kindsman of his to my lodging to let me know that he wanted to speak with me waited on him the same evening and having entr'd on the subject of darien he pull'd out of his pocket a copy of the collonies journal we soon run over the immaterial passages of it and came to that which was like to be the subject of debate to wit the true litle to that country
he argued in favour of the company in some law terms wherein pretend to no judgment farther than my reason will fathom and urg'd that by the no title to any country can be vallid unless it be de facto as well as jure and those he distinguish'd thus all the de june right which the spaniard had to darien was the pope's donation which is never regarded amongst protestant princes that the spaniard had no possession de facto of that country

unless he liv'd on the spot or had his cattle running there

to the first answer'd that if the scots had been in darien as soon as the spaniards and taken possession of it the companies donation might have been as valid as the pope's but as these have been masters of that country by a proscription of years and their title thereto never hitherto contraverted by any prince or state till now by the company
could not see how at that rate any collony or plantation in the universe can be safe
the spaniaras must either be confin'd within their wall'd towns and the reach of their guns or they must be allowed the usual extent round them as all other collonies in america have
the company might with the same justice land on the of jamaico where for leagues running there's neither english man nor beast to be seen altho there are as many if not more wild negroes in the mountains of jamaico who have deserted their masters than indians on thrice so much ground of the isthmus of darien
by the same title the company might have seated themselves on the island of tobaga where there's never a

man without asking the of courland leave
on the other hand the company has settled their collony in the very bosom and centre of the three chies cities of the to wit carthagena portobello and panama the first being about leagues and the other two not above distant from the collony besides several smaller towns and garrisons which are much nearer viz sancta maria tubaconti nay the spaniards are at work in their mines within leagues of fort st andrew

as for the de facto right tis evident that these captains who are over the indian clanns have spanish names to distinguish them from the vulgar speak spanish generally their wives go valed and cover'd after the same fashion the spanish women go altho their men go naked besides one paragraph of the collonies journal makes this very spot of ground where they are settled to be the propriety of the spaniard by their acknowledging captain andreas to have been a spanish captain
as for the defences which batt
sharp adduced on his tryal of the indian emperor there having been no such person on the isthumes of darien these hundred years and king golden cap and

the forg'd commission he produc'd from that emperor it was all trick neither was there much pains taken to hang him or disprove the forgery
the privateers indeed gave the title of king golden cap to the indian captains son who commanded these indians near golden island and he was this andreas his first cousin but kill'd by the spaniards after the privateers left the isthmus as those may now be who entertained the scots so friendly
the irish admitting some french troops into their country does not take away the king of englands title and right to that kingdom

the spanish title is likewise confirmed by the concession of all princes and treaties of peace whereby the spaniard does not only cut off the people of all nations whom he finds cutting logwood in the bay of campechy a great many leagues distant from any spanish town but keeps the barlevento fleet and an armadilla always ranging along that coast and makes prize of all foreigners he finds trading on his coast without his commission if they have so much as a stick of logwood or three pieces of eight aboard which if hed did not act legally to be sure the soveraign heads

of those subjects would long e're now have demanded satisfaction or made reprisal
this was the substance of what offer'd to sir and what use he made of it never inquir'd after as for that part of the champions defence describing the isthumes of darien must tell you that it is calculated in all the matterial passages of it for a scotch meridian as the darien news were for six months by the companies agents here in town who knew that what was printed here and sent to scotland was far better believ'd than the apocrypha
the edenbrugh
was never wanting on his part for he still had something new from st germains to frighten us with the cabals there and private meetings between the late king james and lovis but however necessany such stories might been an inchanted country yet they never went down within the found of

as for the champions endeavouring to prove the scots interest by a separation will excuse my self from medling with that part of the subject knowing at the same time that the wisemen of that country know the benefit of that union

better than this author or some more who make use of the machin of the collony to set the two nations together by the ears the better to advance their own private ends
as for his other fiery ejaculations have no inclination to meddle with them their being little to be got on either side by ripping up of such sores and it not belonging to me to say any thing on that head i'll take my leave of the company and their champion at present and only say that if he is resolved to separate would have him pick some quarrel that's honester than this and the next time he enters the lists to advande juster reasons for it than what he now does for caledonia novissima

an enquiry into the causes of the miscarriage of the scots colony at darien
or an answer to a libel entituled a defence of the scots abdicating darien
submitted to the consideration of the good people of england
cum proximus ardet res tua tunt glasgow

the introduction
the just horrour that all honest men conceiv'd at the harsh and unneighbourly treatment of the scots colony at darien laid the gentlemen who have been most active against it under a necessity of blackening the reputation of those concern'd in that settlement
this they thought necessary in order to prevent any enquiry that perhaps might be made why a neighbouring nation united to the kingdom of england by situation government interest religion affection and constant should be provok'd and trampl'd upon in such a manner contrary to their own laws and original constitution and which may pave the way in time for treating our neighbours in the same manner

to prevent any such enquiry those

gentlemen that have been pleas'd to signalize themselves as much by their hatred to the scotish nation as the latter have signalized their valour and affection for our common liberty and religion have been at pains and expence to save the libeller from the gallows by putting a stop to his trial and filling his pockets with money on condition that he would bespatter the reputation of the scots colony and their masters
the crime is indeed unnatural for a man to turn renegado and a traitor to his country none but a monster like the surgeon could have entertain'd such a thought he sold his god in the last reign by turning papist and therefore tis no great wonder he should sell his country in this and solemnly renounce his going northward for ever provided he might he secur'd against going westward for once

this being the case of the doughty evidence that the faction have produced against the scots colony we leave it to the world to judg what credit ought to

be given to his testimony since it appears that he harh giv'n it in to save his life to gain money and to give vent to his malice
the latter he owns in the beginning of his book and repeats it again
where he says he took this way to right himself because of the scots here in town being on his top and of some other harsh usage which he receiv'd at the hands of the scots company
the very manner of giving in his evidence lays him open to the lash of the english law and it is to be presum'd that his train of blasphemies and constant ridiculing the text would have been taken notice of e're now by a certain court at the west end of paul's but that he is protected by some gentlemen belonging to a court at the west end of the town

his invenom'd malice is demonstrable by the sport he makes to himself throughout his libel at the calamities and misery of his and countrymen so that never did any man more exactly fill up the character

of a renegado than himself for as those miscreants stab an image of our saviour to the heart as a proof of having absolutely denied him hath in the same manner done all he could to stab the reputation of his native country as a certain evidence of his being turn'd a monster in nature for which even they that imploy him must needs abhor him except they love to see the image of their own crimes in his lovely features
we have not enter'd upon the detail of his malicious lies with which he hath stuff'd his book but have only pointed at the chief of them which are so very notorious as may well put his suborners to the blush that they should not have either taught him his lesson better or have seen he had conn'd it more exactly for they are such gross contradictions either to common sense or to what he himself has advanc'd in his libel that none but one who had swallow'd transubstantiation could be guilty of the like

it's needless to enlarge upon his character since it's impossible to conceive

a worse idea of him than all men of sense will immediately form to themselves when they know he is a traitor to his country
he was was formerly a surgeon in the fleet and made some interest amongst the officers by female mediation which was allow'd him by his last religion for his book shews that now he has none
hence it is that he expresses himself so readily in the dialect of his office and talks of bullying kings in his dedication to shew us that he was acquainted with rhetorick and they that know his friends in say he has convey'd his libel to the world through a very proper channel

whilst he was a surgeon in the fleet his ill nature having condemn'd him to perpetual broyls he had the impudence to draw upon his captain ashore who wounded him so as twas thought might have put a period to his infamous life upon which his captain was confin'd but the wound not being mortal the gentleman was set at liberty and returning on board a council of war was held by which was like to have had an exit more answerable to his desert at the but that one of our who commanded in the place sav'd him out of pity and whilst he was sculking at london to avoid this prosecution others of them out of

compassion hir'd him to go along with their fleet for which he hath made his country such a grateful reward as hath verify'd the proverb that save a from the gallows he shall be the first that will cut your throat
we leave his suborners to think on't
his captain being thus disappointed of having justice executed was forc'd to content himself with pricking him run that he might not have any claim to his wages but since his return from darien and engaging in the honourable service of reviling and belying his country his suborners out of their innate bounty and gratitude have got him deliver'd from all farther prosecution entitled him to his wages and given him the opportunity to value himself upon his corespondence at the court end of the town so that now he thinks himself sure of a patent for life and that he shall never be oblig'd to go up holborn except his important occasions call him now and then that way to enable him to pay his present debts when some of his brethren pass that road to pay their last
it had been easie for us to have given such a history of his life as would have put his suborners to the blush but we reserve that to make use of as we shall see occasion what's said is enough to let them know how much they are to trust to his evidence if they think fit to make further use of him either by libelling his country or accusing any of those great families he threatens in his dedication
an inquiry into the causes of the miscariage of the scots colony at darien
the main design of and his suborners is to charge the miscarriage of the scots colony upon their own country to clear some gentlemen that perhaps may be found within the verge of from having any hand in it and to evince the necessity of those proclamations publish'd against the scots in the so as no person or party in england may seem justly chargeable with the ruin of that colony a certain evidence that the crime is very black and that they are put to a miserable shift when those gentlemen are at such expence of contrivance and pains to wipe off the imputation and so ready to fall in with any tool that they think can assist them in so doing

enough has been said already to demonstrate that the evidence of such an infamous person as and so circumstantiated would not be admitted in any court of judicature in europe especially against such an honourable society as the company of scotland for trading to africa and the indies which consists of the very flower of the nation and perhaps has more persons of illustrious

birth quality and merit in it than any trading company that ever yet was erected in the world
the directors particularly whom and his masters have condemned to the halter
are most of them persons of that quality estate worth and untainted honour as the accusation of no one particular person tho of never so good repute could in justice or decency be admitted against them and much less the malicious calumnies of a renegado
but to set this matter in a clearer light whereas we have only own word for what he asserts in vindication of his friends and suborners we shall demonstrate against him and them too from undeniable matter of fact that some people in england are justly chargeable with the ruin of that colony
we shall begin with the opposition made to the scots act by the parliament of england to whom the matter was misrepresented the answer they obtain'd from the king and the prosecution they commenc'd and threatned against english natives and residing in england that should subscribe to the scots company
in the next place we alledg the english resident's memorial at hamburgh against that governments suffering any of their subjects to subscribe to the scots company
it is likewise well enough known that the influence and example of the english court hinder'd the subscriptions of our neighbours in holland
nor can it be denied but this continued thread of opposition from the court of england must needs hinder the subscriptions of a great many in scotland who could not but foresee that a storm was threatned by so many clouds
to this we may add that the kingdom of scotland have not yet forgot the discourting of the marquiss of tweddale who was known to be an able statesman and a true patriot to his country because of his touching that act when he had the honor to represent his majesty on the throne
nor was it the least of our misfortunes that we lost such an able and faithful minister of state as secretary johnston and that too upon the account of his affection to his country in this matter
we are very well satisfied that his majesty who advanc'd him to that post for his merit and was so well satisfied with his ability and care would scarcely have parted with a minister of that gentleman's faithfulness and penetration but by the intrigues of some people at court
before we proceed any further with the narrative of the opposition made to us we shall obviate one objection which some persons may possibly make viz
that all we have said hitherto is nothing to the purpose because it does not regard our colony but the company
to which we reply
that this is so far from being an excuse to our opposers that it highly aggravates our charge against them as being a plain demonstration that they were resolv'd to obstruct our trade in every respect and whatever it should be without any exception

that the opposing of the company was the direct method to prevent our ever having a colony and by the laws of god and man those who endeavour to destroy the embrio are chargeable with a design of preventing the birth
but we shall come closer to the point in a little time and resume the thread of our narrative after one or two observations upon what we have said already viz
that the greatest of those difficulties and disappointments which says in his book the company met with as to their subscriptions payments may justly be charg'd to the account of that opposition made us from the court of england

that there is so little reason to upbraid us that our efforts were not greater that it is rather to be wonder'd at that the company was not dash'd to pieces and crush'd in the bud and much more that ever they should have been able to weather out the storm of so much indignation overcome all those difficulties find mony enough to build ships equip out a fleet and make a settlement in america when neither england nor residing there hamburgh nor holland shall dare to assist them without incurring his majesty of england displeasure

but to come directly to the narrative of the opposition made to our colony
it is well enough known that the kingdom of scotland as many other parts of europe have suffered much for three or four years past by bad
harvests which rendred them uncapable of providing bread for their people at home and much more of sending supplies to their infant colony abroad this was very manifest to some people about and care was taken we should have none for our mony from england tho that nation could have spar'd it and perhaps we might have pleaded it as our merit when in parliament we voted his majesty a standing army upon his royal word that it was necessary tho we had more need to have sav'd the mony to have bought bread for thousands of our people that were starving for want afforded us the melancholy prospect of dying by shoals in our streets and have left behind them a

reigning contagion which hath swept away multitudes more and god knows where it may end
tho our country was reduced to this deplorable state that a generous enemy would have shew'd us compassion yet the malice of our court adversaries did not rest here nor with having follow'd us into holland and germany but pursues us into america and with angry proclamations forbids the subjects there on pain of his majesty's displeasure to afford any manner of assistance to the scots at darien so that we are starv'd at home and abroad by our enemies at court who having by this means dispossess'd us of our colony at darien and knowing that the good people of england had reason to cry shame upon them and might perhaps take their own time to resent this inhuman treatment of their neighbours in scotland therefore they found it necessary to suppress a book wrote in defence of the scots settlement and to hire a scots renegado surgeon to varnish over the matter and to represent his countrymen as knaves and fools that so they might fall unpitied
to return again to the opposition made us in america it is not enough that we are starv'd out of darien but when we come from thence and so leave what the proclamations suppose to be the dominions of their allies yet we must not be supplied in the english plantations nor have provisions in exchange for our effects tho our men be dying for want on pain of incurring the displeasure of the court and therefore those who are willing to relieve us must put their inventions on the rack to sind out a way to do that with safety which common humanity and much more christianity obliges them to do to a turk or a jew in the like circumstances
nay farther tho notwithstanding our distress at home we make shift to send a convoy to our colony abroad because our future hopes depended so much upon it they shall not have leave to put in to any english port to refit refresh or stay for any of their company that may be separated from them by storm and yet our friends who were so instrumental in obtaining and publishing those proclamations must bribe a renegado to declare to the world in print that they were no way accessary to the blood of his that were starv'd to death at darien

it will appear plain that the ruin of the colony is chargeable on the proclamations if we consider the consternation that must needs be among them when they saw themselves condemned as having invaded the dominions of his majesty's allies so that they had all the reason in the world to think that they were not only precluded from all possibility of having any further supply or assistance from home but in danger of being attack'd by his fleet as they that advis'd the emitting of those proclamations must needs think his majesty was oblig'd in honour and justice to order if he was of opinion that the scots had broken the alliance betwixt him and spain
let any reasonable man consider what anguish and perplexity these considerations join'd to their pinching wants and other circumstances must occasion in the minds of those poor men and whether it might not give a handle to those of them that were unwilling to stay to mutiny against the rest and put all into disorder which might be fomented by other ill persons amongst them for we are not to suppose that with or men there went no other ill man but since it's not improbable that they who opposed our company so much from the very

beginning might be prompted by the same malice to send spies and traitors amongst our men on purpose to defeat their design
if it had not been that they were thus discouraged and brought to their by those proclamations they would certainly have had so much conduct as to have sent away a great part of their men to jamaica or any of the english plantations where they might have subsisted till the arrival of a convoy from scotland and so with those provisions that were sufficient to carry them as far as new york and a great deal further if they had not been retarded by tempests might have maintain'd a competent number of their men to keep possession of the colony till supplies had arriv'd but the proclamations disabled them from taking this method and by consequence are chargeable with the ruin of the colony
in the next place it is undeniable that those proclamations must needs have incouraged the spainards and other enemies in their opposition against our colony and animated them to go on with their preparations to drive us out
so that had they deserted upon no other account but the noise of the great preparations making against them by the spaniards at carthagena porto bello as sir william beeston seem'd to insinuate in his letter it makes the proclamations directly chargeable with the ruin of the colony since they had good reason to remove from thence when their own prince had forbid all commerce with them and when their enemies were making formidable preparations against them

it is likewise plain that those proclamations must necessarily prevent their having any supplies from the dutch at curassaw if they had any to spare for since the influence of ours and the dutch court

prevented our company's having any incouragement in holland it is reasonable to believe it would have the same influence in reference to our colony in the dutch plantations
we have likewise all the reason in the world to conclude that the influence of those proclamations might hinder the natives from giving our colony those supplies that it was in their power to have done for there's no doubt but they had information of em industriously sent them by some of our adversaries when capt long was so malicious as to endeavour at our first arrival to possess them with an opinion that we were nothing but pirats and that the of great britain would disown us and indeed by the event it would seem he had instructions so to do
it is true that at first the natives seeing our men have a competency of all sorts of provisions might not believe his report but they must needs have been confirm'd in the truth of it afterwards when they saw them dying for want and deceiv'd as to their expectation of further supplies and upon that account might think they had sufficient ground to withdraw their assistance from them and not further provoke the spaniards in favour of a people that they found were not able to do any thing for themselves and by consequence uncapable to protect them which was the thing they were to expect from their alliance
having thus made it evident that the opposition our company met with from court at first and the proclamations issued against our colony at last are justly to be reputed among the principal causes of the miscarriage of that design we come in the next place to consider his majesty's answer to the address of the commons of england on that head and the proclamations issued out against us in his name in the
we are sorry that ever there should have been any occasion for such an ungrateful piece of work but think it a duty incumbent upon us and what we owe to the constitution of our country which we have reason to believe is industriously conceal'd from his majesty to write freely on this head that the world may see what just cause we have to complain

his majesty's answer that he had been ill serv'd in scotland is such as our ancestors if we may believe our historians would have thought inconsistent with the trust reposed in a king of scots a manifest reflection upon the justice and fidelity of the nation and a discovery of their arcana imperii to those that were quarrelling with them
we are not to suppose that his majesty would give an answer to an address of this importance without counsel if he consulted with our dutch or english opposers it was the same as if he had consulted our professed enemies if he consulted with scots and was advis'd to this answer by any of them they are traitors to their country and have betray'd its soveraignty for they ought to have advis'd him to answer that as king of scots he was not to give an account to the english for any thing transacted in that kingdom but if they found themselves any ways aggrivev'd or thought their trade endanger'd by the scots act he should be willing to have the matter debated and adjusted by commissioners of both nations as became the common father of both
this could not justly have been look'd upon by the english as a refractory or stubborn answer but must have been imputed to his braveness of temper and fidelity to his trust
but at once to give up the soveraignty of scotland without demurring upon it argues that his majesty was advis'd

to this answer by enemies to the scotish nation

our parliaments have originally a greater power than that of england for what the states of scotland offer'd to the touch of the scepter their kings had no power to refuse or if they did the resolves of the states had the force of a law notwithstanding
thus our reformation was established in by an act of the states and tho our queen mary then in france and her husband the dauphin afterwards francis refus'd to give their consent it remain'd a firm law which mary when she return'd to scotland was so far from offering to dispense with tho she was a great asserter of her prerogative that she was oblig'd to intreat of the states so far to dispense with it themselves as to suffer her to have mass in her own family
we might go farther back to the reign of robert ii who was check'd by the states for making a truce with the english without their consent it not being then in the power of our kings either to make peace or war without the states
but the truth of that maxim laid down by our historian that the supreme power of the government of scotland is in the states is so obvious to every one that reads our history that it cannot be denied and hence it is that our old acts of parliament are often call'd the acts of the states and say the three states enact for by our original constitution the king is none of the states but only dux belli and minister publicus which was well understood by our viceroy the of morton and the other deputies from the states of scotland when they acquainted elizabeth in their memorial that the scots created their kings on that condition that they might when they saw cause divest them of that power which they receiv'd from the people which we have now reasserted in making

our crown forfeitable by the claim of right at the last revolution and perhaps that's none of the least causes why our ruin is now endeavour'd by the abettors of a growing prerogative
it were easy for us to enlarge on this and to shew from our histories and acts of parliaments that our kings according to our antient constitution which those rapes committed on our liberties in some of the last reigns can never overturn were inferior to their parliaments who inthron'd and dethron'd them as they saw cause made them accountable for their administration allow'd them no power of proroguing them without their own consent nor of hindering their meeting when the ardua regni negotia requir'd it
they could not make peace or war without them nor so much as dispose of their castles but by their consent
their councils were chosen and sworn in parliament and punishable by the states nor had they any revenue but what their parliaments allow'd them
these and many more were the native liberties of the people of scotland an
and their representation of their proceedings against the mistakes in the king's declaration in
and therefore his majesty had no reason to say he was ill serv'd by the passing of an act offer'd by the states of scotland

the ignorance of those things have often occafion'd our being misrepresented by the english historians and other writers as rebels and what not when we really acted according to our own fundamental laws
and not only they but even our own princes since the union of the crowns have either been kept ignorant of our constitution or so incens'd against it by the abettors of

tyranny that they have all of em his present majesty excepted endeavour'd our overthrow as well knowing it to be impossible to bring arbitrary government to perfection whilst a people who had always breath'd in a free air and call'd their princes to an account when they invaded their properties were in any condition to defend themselves or assist others against such princes as design'd an absolute sway
but the pill being too bitter to be swallowed by it self there was a necessity of taking priestcraft into the composition and to gild it over with the specious pretext of bringing the scots to an uniformity in religion
the court knew that this would arm the zealots against us and that it could never be aflected without the ruin of our kingdom whose religion was so interwoven with our civil constitution that there was no overturning of the one without subverting the other
this will appear plain to those that know that besides the sanction of acts of parliament the church of scotland is defended by a full representative of the clergy and laity of the kingdom call'd a general assembly which preserves us from being as our parliaments do from being where the king by law had no negative voice no more than he formerly had in our parliaments
this in effect is the representative of the nation as christians as the parliaments are our representatives as men and as to the laity many of them are the same individual persons that sit in parliament
so that those assemblies being a second barrier about our liberties it was thought sit to run down the constitution of our church as not suted with monarchy
the case being thus we dare refer it to the thoughts of our neighbouring nation who have gallantly from time to time stood up for

their own liberties whether it were not more generous for them to unite with us than to suffer us to be oppress'd and enslav'd
there's nothing can be objected to this but that all these glorious privileges were swallow'd up by those acts of parliament that exalted the prerogative to such a height in the reign of charles ii
to which we answer that the privileges of a nation cannot be giv'n away without their own consent and we are morally certain that the constituents even of those pack'd parliaments did never give any commission to those that represented them to give away those liberties
slavery is repugnant to human nature so that it cannot be supposed the nation exalted the prerogative on purpose to put themselves in a worse condition than besore or that when they find it applied to another use than that which they gave it for they may not reduce it to its antient boundary
the necessity of affairs did sometimes oblige the romans to entrust their dictators with an extraordinary and absolute power but when the occasion ceas'd they recalled it and kept to their antient and rational maxim that salus populi is suprema lex
in the like manner the enemies of our old constitution may know if they please that we have retrieved the main point of making our crown forfeitable by the claim of right and therefore if they push us too far it's a thousand to one but we may renew our demands to the rest or oblige them to cast them into the bargain

but to return from this digression
tho we had no such peculiar privileges belonging to us why might not we expect that his majesty should be as kind to us as to our brethren in england he hath once and again declared to them in parliament that he never had nor never will have an interest
distinct

from that of his people
then why should not the interest of the people of scotland be the same with the interest of the king of scots and if the people of scotland met in parliament agreed upon it as their interest to have that act past for incouraging kieir trade how was it possible that the king of scots could be ill serv'd by the passing that act in scotland

our enemies and suborners have put a sort of an answer to this in his mouth viz
that the said act was obtain'd viis modis but the falshood and malice of that insinuation will appear to the world by the previous act of
for incouraging of foreign trade by which it was statuted

that merchants more or fewer may contract and enter into such societies and companies for carrying on trade as to any subject of goods or merchandise to whatsomever kingdoms countries or parts of the world not being in war with his majesty where trade is in use to be or may be follow'd and particularly besides the kingdoms and countries of europe to the east and the straits and to trade in the mediterranean or upon the coast of africa or elsewhere as above
which societies and companies being contracted and entred into upon the terms and in the usual manner as such companies are set majesty with consent aforesaid did allow and approve giving and granting to them and each of them all powers rights and privileges as to their persons rules and orders that by the laws are given to companies allowed to be erected for manufactories and his majesty for their greater incouragement did promise to give to those companies and each of them his letters patent under the great seal confirming

to them the whole foresaid powers and privileges with what other incouragement his majesty should judg needful

these are the very terms of the act of
and in pursuance of this act our nation being willing to form a company for trading to africa and the indies this act which hath met with so much opposition in the world was past june

which was two years after
then with what effrontery can and his suborners suggest that it was obtain'd viis modis by surprise or in a surreptitious manner but something they must say to justify their unreasonable treatment of us and to blind the eyes of the world
thus we see then that the parliament of scotland went on deliberately to advance their trade and to make this act by which it's evident that they who advis'd his majesty to say that he was ill serv'd in scotland impos'd upon him have laid a foundation of division betwixt him and his parliament which are the two constituent parts of our government and if they be dash'd against one another the whole frame of it must of necessity be dissolv'd
hence also it is evident that those counsellors if ought by our old constitution to be call'd to an account by the parliament according to the act of parl james
and if they be englishmen or dutchmen we have a right to demand justice against them as having meddled in our affairs contrary to the laws of nations

the soveraignty of our nation and the independency of the of scots upon the crown of england being tacitely giv'n up by this answer and the parliament of england being possess'd by our enemies with a false
notion of our design they put a stop to our taking subscriptions from

any residenters in england tho our offering to take in the english as sharers was a plain demonstration of the uprightness of our intentions towards that nation
this made it apparent that we had no design in the least to supplant them in their trade but on the contrary to make them partakers in ours in order to lay a foundation for a closer union and greater amity betwixt the two nations which if it had taken effect our trade had not been nipp'd in the bud as now it is by the frowns of the court but might by this time have been improv'd to the advancement of the glory and strength of the island whereas by the opposition made to that noble design the nations are more alienated from one another than before lessen'd in their strength and trade and scotland for ever lost as to their friendship usefulness and joining with england on any occasion whatever unless proper measures be taken to make up the breach and retrieve our lost honour and advantage

all that can be said to excuse so false a step in such a wise nation as england is that they were impos'd upon by those that are enemies to the true liberties of both nations and by some of their traders and ignorant pretenders to give advice in matters of trade who out of a sordid principle of preferr'd their own private gain to the general advantage of their country
this would have quickly been seen had his majesty and the parliament of england instead of that violent opposition which they made to the scots act desir'd a conference betwixt a committee of the parliaments of both nations then it would soon have appear'd what our true design was and that it was neither our interest nor intention immediately to follow an trade

the apprehensions of which did so much alarm the kingdom of england
that it was not our intention is evident from our rejecting the proposals of our countryman mr douglas the merchant with which upbraids us by which at the same time he discovers his own folly and dishonesty his folly in arguing against the interest of england which he pretends to espouse and his dishonesty in proposing our following a trade which his new masters who have paid him so well for his false evidence look upon to be destructive to theirs

that it was not our interest immediately to think of an trade is evident from this that it would have exported our mony with which it's known we do not abound and ruin'd the linen manufacture of our country upon which so many of our poor depend
this we think the city of london may be sensible of in a good measure by the multitudes of their own that are starv'd for want of imployment and also by the unsuccessfulness of their own linen manufacture in england by reason of the great quantity of silks muslins calicoes brought from the from whence some wise men have been and are still of opinion that an trade of that sort tends to the general impoverishment of europe tho it may enrich particular persons
these considerations together with some jealousies that mr douglas might have been put upon making us that proposal on purpose to divert us from our other design of an american trade were the true reasons of our not hearkening to mr douglas advice
this our neighbours might have known had they proceeded with us in such a friendly manner as we had reason to expect when we were so kind as to offer them a share

in the benefits of our act
and the government at the same time might soon have been satisfied that the sinking of their customs by our own and twenty years freedom from that duty was a meer bugbear pretence
it is evident that we could not have spent much goods in scotland and therefore must have exported them
if we had brought them to england they were liable to customs there
if we had offer'd to run them over the border they could as well have prevented that as the stealing over their own corn and wool and if we had exported them to any other places of europe the english by their drawbacks could have done it in effect as cheap as we
by all which it appears that there was no solid foundation for any of those pretended reasons why the government in particular or the english in general should have oppos'd us and we wish that upon due inquiry it may not be found to be the effect of dutch councils for that people being jealous of their trade and rivals to england on that account cannot be suppos'd to have sat still and done nothing when they saw we had obtain'd such an act and were resolv'd to take in the english to partake in our trade which if suffer'd to go on might endanger theirs and enable the english to outrival them indeed besides the present loss they foresaw of our custom the scots having most of their goods from holland

this we have the more reason to suspect first because tho the english have formerly suffered in their trade by the incroachments and intrigues of the dutch but never by the scots yet they have made no application to his majesty for preventing the like in time to come
if it be said that be is but stadtholder there whereas he is

of scots we can easily reply that it appears by what has been said already of our true constitution that the kings of scotland were as much accountable to the states of that nation as the dutch stadtholder is to the states of holland
the reason we have to suspect the influence of dutch councils in this affair is this that tis their interest to keep us and the english from uniting and if possible of forcing us by that means into an alliance with themselves to prevent their own ruin if england after this should come to fall out with them upon the account of trade or otherwise and likewise to have their privilege of fishing in our seas continued which they know to be of such vast advantage to them that they are shrewdly suspected of having by bribes or other indirect methods prevail'd with some great men to supplant us as to the benefits we had just reason to expect from the act of
incouraging our fishery the privileges granted by which are very considerable and to continue for ever nay to put it out of all doubt that they are join'd in this matter against us owns it as beforemention'd

being upon this subject we cannot but take notice of the difference betwixt the spanish memorials about darien and of those late memorials presented by them to our court against their meddling with the succession of that monarchy or the cantoning it out into several parcels in case the king of spain die without issue
the former tho insolent and hussing enough were procur'd by our court therefore calmly digested and the desire of them effectually answer'd to the ruin almost of the scotish nation but the latter was no sooner presented than the spanish ambassadors

are disgrac'd in england and holland and forbid both courts

it may therefore deserve the inquiry of our neighbours what this regulation about the succession of spain and the dismembring of their monarchy is that occasion such outragious memorials for there must needs be something in it that touches the spaniards more sensibly than the business of darien and which they did not complain of till they were put upon it and in like manner touches our court more sensibly to the quick than any memorials about that affair tho they had not been of their own procurement were capable of doing
perhaps upon a narrow scrutiny into this affair it will be found that this keen and uninterrupted opposition made to the scots settlement at darien does not proceed from any foresight of damage that it could do to the trade of england tho that be the specious pretext but from a cause which touches some people more nearly crosses their project of dismembring the spanish monarchy and of having that important post to their own share they know that they have a natural as well as a political interest in some great courtiers and make little doubt of obtaining the preheminence before either of those nations that compose the empire of great britain
it concerns our neighbours so much the more to inquire into this because it is visible from the resentments of it by the spanish court that this matter is more like to affect the advantageous trade that england drives with spain than our settlement in america was ever like to do which tho it be made a sacrifice to his catholick majesty and perhaps on purpose to make him digest the other project with more

ease is like to be of as little advantage to england as was the sacrifice of the great sir walter raleigh formerly tho it may be infinitely more to their damage
if our neighbours have a mind to be fully inform'd of this matter they know who were imploy'd in those negotiations and how to speak with them
we come next to consider the opposition made to our subscriptions at hamburgh by sir paul ricaut the english resident there in conjunction with his majesty's envoy to the court of lunenburg who deliver'd in a joint memorial to the senate of hamburgh threatning them with the heighth of his majesty's displeasure if they join'd with the scots in any treaty of commerce whatsoever
this we shall not need to make any reflexions upon the petitions from the company to his majesty and his privy council in scotland being sufficient for that end
their first to the king was dated june the
and is as follows
to the king's most excellent majesty the humble address of the council general of the company of scotland trading to africa and the indies

may it please your majesty

whereas by the act of the session and by the act of the session of your majesty's current parliament as well as by your majesty's patent under the great seal of this kingdom this company is established with such ample privileges as were thought most proper and encouraging both to natives and foreigners to join in the carrying on supporting and advancement of our trade the most considerable of the nobility gentry merchants and whole body of the royal burrows have upon the inducement and publick faith of your majesty and act of parliament and letters patent contributed as adventurers in raising a far more considerable joint stock than any was ever before raised in this kingdom for any publick undertaking or project of trade whatsoever which makes it now of so much the more universal a concern to the nation

and for the better enabling us to accomplish the ends of your majesty's said act of parliament and letters patent we have pursuant thereunto appointed certain deputies of our own number to transact and negotiate our necessary affairs

beyond sea and at the same time to treat with such foreigners of any nation in amity with your majesty as might be inclinable to join with us for the purpose aforesaid
in the prosecution of which commission to our said deputies vested with full power and authority according to law we are not a little surprized to find to the great hindrance and obstruction of our affairs that your majesty's envoy to the courts of lunenburgh and resident at hamburgh have under pretence of special warrant from your majesty given in a joint subscribed memorial to the senat of hamburgh expresly invading the privileges granted to our company by your majesty's said acts of parliament and letters patent as by the herewith transmitted copy may appear
by the which memorial we sustain great and manifold prejudices since both the senat and inhabitants of the said city of hamburgh are thereby contrary to the law of nations expresly threatned with your majesty's displeasure if they or either of them should countenance or join with us in any treaty of trade or commerce whatsoever which deprives us of the assistance which we had reason to expect from several inhabitants of that city

for redress whereof we do in all duty and humility apply to your majesty not only for the protection and maintenance of our privileges and freedom of trade but also for reparation of damage conform to your majesty's said acts of parliament and letters patent
and we further beg leave humbly to represent to your majesty that tho by the said acts of parliament and letters patent we conceive our selves legally and sufficiently authorized to treat even with

any soveraign potentate or state in amity with your majesty for the support and advancement of our trade yet we by our said deputies have only treated with particular and private merchants of the said city of hamburgh without ever making any the least proposal to the senate thereof and this we humbly conceive to be the natural right and privilege of all merchants whatsoever even tho we had wanted the sanction of so solemn laws and without some speedy redress be had therein not only this company but all the individual merchants of this kingdom must from henceforward conclude that all our rights and freedoms of trade are and may be further by our neighbours violently wrested out of our hands
we therefore to prevent the further evil consequences of the said memorial to our company in particular do make our most humble and earnest request to your majesty that you would be graciously pleased to grant us such declarations as in your royal wisdom you shall think fit to render the senate and inhabitants of the said city of hamburgh and all others that are or may be concerned secure from the threatnings and other suggestions contain'd in the said memorial as well as to render us secure under your majesty's protection in the full prosecution of our trade and free injoyment of our lawful rights privileges and immunities contained in your majesty's acts of parliament and letters patent

my lords and gentlemen

we are impowered by the king to signify unto you that as soon as his majesty shall return to england he will take into consideration what you have represented unto him and that in the mean time his majesty will give orders to his envoy at the courts of lunenburgh and his resident at hamburgh not to make use of his majesty's name or authority for obstructing your company in the prosecution of your trade with the inhabitants of that city

the company finding that the said resident did notwithstanding this answer continue his opposition and deny that he had any orders to the contrary petitioned his majesty's privy council afresh as follows
to the right honourable the lord high chancellour and remanent lords of his majesty's most honourable privy council the humble representation of the council general of the company of scotland trading to africa and the indies

may it please your lordships

tis not unknown to your lordships how that in several successive sessions of this current parliament his majesty's instructions to his respective high commissioners and their several speeches pursuant thereto have been full of repeated assurances of his majesty's good inclinations for incouraging the trade and manufactories of this nation and whereas accordingly by the act of the fourth session and the act of the fifth session of the said parliament together with his majesty's patent under the great seal of this kingdom our company is established with such ample privileges and immunities as were thought most proper for encouraging both natives and foreigners to join in the carrying on supporting and advancement of our trade we in pursuance and upon the publick faith thereof not only contributed at home a far more considerable joint stock than ever was yet rais'd in this nation for any publick undertaking or project of trade

whatsoever but have also had all the promising hopes and prospect of foreign aid that our hearts could wish till to our great surprize the english ministers at hamburgh have under pretence of special warrant from his majesty put a stop thereto by giving in a memorial to the senat of that city threatning both senat and inhabitants with the king's utmost displeasure if they should countenance or join with us in any treaty of trade or commerce as by the annexed copy thereof may appear
upon due consideration whereof we have in all duty and humility addressed his majesty in june last for redress thereof in answer to which address his majesty was then graciously pleased to signify by his royal letter that upon his return into england he would take into consideration the contents of our said address and that in the mean time he would give orders to the said ministers at hamburgh not to make use of his royal name or authority for obstructing the trade of our company with the inhabitants of that city
in the full assurance of which we rested secure and took our measures accordingly till to our further surprize and unspeakable prejudice we find by repeated advices from hamburgh that the said resident continues still contumacious and is so far from giving due obedience to his majesty's said order that upon application made to him by our agent in that city with all the respect due to his character he declared that as yet he had got no such order on our behalf which by a further address we are now to lay before his majesty

but whereas we humbly conceive your lord ships to be more immediatly under his majesty the guardians of the laws and liberties of this

kingdom we think it our duty to represent to your lordships the consequences of the said memorial both with relation to our company in particular and the privileges interest honour dignity and reputation of the nation in general

your lordships very well know of what concern the success of this company is to the whole kingdom and that scarce any particular society or corporation within the same can justly boast of so solemn and unanimous a suffrage or sanction as the acts of parliament by which this company is established
so that if effectual measures be not taken for putting an early stop to such an open and violent infringement of and incroachment upon the privileges of so solemn a constitution tis hard to guess how far it may in after ages be made use of as a precedent for invading and overturning even the very fundamental rights natural liberties and indisputable independency of this kingdom which by the now open and frequent practices of our unkind neighbours seem to be too shrewdly pointed at
and should this company wherein the most considerable of the nobility gentry merchants and whole body of the royal burroughs are concerned be so unhappy which god forbid as to have its designs rendered unsuccessful through the unaccountable evil treatments of our said neighbours most certain it is that no consideration whatever can hereafter induce this nation to join in any such other publick stock tho never so advantageous an undertaking as not doubting but to meet with the like or greater discouragements from those who give such frequent and manifest indications of their designs to

wrest our right and freedom of trade out of our hands
for which cause we humbly offer the premises to your lordships serious consideration not doubting but you will in your profound wisdom and prudence take such effectual measures for redress thereof at present and to prevent the like incroachments for the future as may be capable to remove those apprehensions and jealousies which the and avowed methods of the english do now suggest not only to our company in particular but even to the whole body of this nation in general

to the king's most excellent majesty the humble address of the council general of the company of scotland trading to africa and the indies

may it please your majesty

by a former address of the of june last we have humbly represented to your majesty that your majesty's envoy to the court of lunenburgh and resident at hamburgh did under pretence of special warrant from your majesty give in a memorial to the senat of the said city of hamburgh contrary to the law of nations and expresly invading the privileges contained in the said acts of parliament and letters patent by which our said company is established copies of which address and memorial we have for your majesty's better information hereto annexed in answer to which your majesty was then graciously pleased to signify by your royal letter that upon your majesty's arrival in england you would take the contents of our said address into consideration and that in the mean time you would give orders to your said minister not to make use of your majesty's name or authority for obstructing our comapny in the prosecution of our trade with the inhabitants of the said city of hamburgh
in the full assurance of which we rested secure and took our measures accordingly till to our further fur prize and great disappointment we find by repeated advices

from hamburgh that your majesty's said resident continues still contumacious and is so far from giving due obedience to your majesty's said order that upon application made to him for that effect with all respect due to his character he pretended that he had never as yet got any such order on our behalf which we thought fit in all duty and humility to lay before your majesty renewing withal our most humble and earnest request that your majesty would be now graciously pleas'd to take the contents of this and our said former address into consideration and in your royal wisdom order some speedy and effectual redress of our grievances therein mentioned and a just reparation of the manifest damages which our company has already fustain'd by reason of the said memorial and grant us a declaration under your royal hand to render the senat and inhabitants of the city of hamburgh and all others with whom we may have occasion to enter into commerce secure from threatnings and other false suggestions contained in the said memorial as well as to render us secure under your majesty's protection in the free enjoyment of our lawful rights and privileges contained in your majesty's acts of parliament and letters patent above mentioned

an address to his majesty by the parliament
we your majesty's most loyal and faithful subjects the noblemen barons and burgesses convened in parliament do humbly represent to your majesty that having consider'd a representation made to us by the council general of the company trading to africa and the indies making mention of several obstructions they have met with in the prosecution of their trade particularly by a memorial presented to the senat of hamburgh by your majesty's residents in that city tending to lessen the credit of the rights and privileges granted to the said company by an act of this present parliament we do therefore in all humble duty lay before your majesty the whole nations concern in this matter and we most earnestly do entreat and most assuredly expect that your majesty will in your royal wisdom take such measures as may effectually vindicate the undoubted rights and privileges of the said company and support the credit and interest thereof
and as we are in duty bound to return your majesty most hearty thanks for the gracious assurances your majesty has been pleased to give us of all due encouragement for promoting the trade of this kingdom so we are thereby encouraged at present humbly to recommend to the more special marks of your royal favour the concerns of the said company as that branch of our trade in which we and the nation we represent have a more peculiar interest
subscribed at edinburgh the of august
in name presence and by warrant of the estates of parliament

seafield

by all this it is evideht that the whole kingdom of scotland was unanimous in this matter and proceeded deliberately in it as that which highly concern'd their interest yet we see that all their endeavours were to no purpose for our enemies were so resolute in opposing our trade that rather than it should succeed they will not only trample under foot the laws of scotland but the laws of nations and exactly follow the pattern set them by the french in huffing and tyrannizing over their neighbours when at the same time they pretend to make war upon lewis

xiv for practices of the same nature and whilst they cry out upon the decisions of the chambers of brisac and mets and of the parliament of paris as tyrannical and unjust for invading the rights of neighbouring princes and nations they set up a cabal at whitehall to do the like by scotland and hamburgh
then let the world judg whether the king of england had not less reason to say that he was ill serv'd in scotland than the king of scots had to say that he was ill serv'd in england since one single address from the parliament of england prevail'd with their king to forbid all his subjects to join with the scots whereas the repeated supplications of the company of scotland the address of their parliament and the authority of law and his own letters patent could not prevail with the king of scots to do justice to his own subjects
we wish these gentlemen would consider this who were so very angry at the author of the defence of the scots settlement for saying that the king of scots was detain'd prisoner in england
it is very certain that never any king of scotland before the union of the crowns dar'd thus to trample upon their laws or to oppose the general interest of the nation or if they attempted to do it they were quickly made sensible of their being inferior to the law and the states of the nation assembled in parliament who till the accession of our princes to the english throne remain'd in an undisputed possession of calling their kings to an account for maleadministration and of disposing of thei lives and liberties as they saw cause
we need not go so far back for evidence to prove this as eugenius the who was brought to his tryal on suspition of having murder'd his own wife and acquitted upon discovery of the real murderers or of james

iii whose minions by whose council he governed were taken out of his own by the nobles and hanged over and he himself persisting in those courses was killed in flight after being defeated in battle by the states and in the next parliament was voted to be lawfully slain
we have a later instance and the power of our nation on that head was largely asserted and accounted for by the earl of morton then regent of scotland in that noble memorial he delivered in to elizabeth and her council in defence of our proceedings against mary whom we dethron'd and in her stead set up her son so that it is not the principle or practice of any one party of our nation tho it has been of late fix'd upon the presbyterians as peculiar to them but was an hereditary right conveyed to us all by our ancestors practised by papists before the reformation and justisied by those of the episcopal perswasion since particularly by the earl of morton beforemention'd who was the first that introduc'd bishops into our church after the reformation

those things are not insisted upon with any design of applying them to his present majesty or of incensing the people of scotland to do so but only to inform those that put his majesty upon such courses that they are his greatest enemies and do what in them lies to destroy him
it is the common right of mankind to be protected by those they set over them and to complain of governors when they find themselves aggriev'd and their privileges torn from them by violence
this generation has prov'd it beyond possibility of reply that the greatest pretenders to submission to princes and the most zealous patrons of passive obedience will resist and dethrone their

kings too when they find themselves oppressed by them
they that maintain the contrary are nothing but flatterers or such as temporize with courts because of their own private advantage and be their quality what it will are far from being so noble and brave as that poor woman who told philip of macedon that he ceas'd to be king when he refus'd to hear her petition
upon the whole it will appear that he author of the defence of the scots settlement made the best apology for his majesty that could be made when he said that he was a prisoner in england and therefore forc'd to act thus against the interest and dignity of his crown as king of scots
it is demonstrated thus if his majesty were in scotland and another person upon the throne of england it is certain his majesty would have encouraged the trade of scotland and resented such practices in the king of england as contrary to the laws of nations and the soveraignty of his crown if he did not he would be look'd upon to be and not fit to wear it and if he took part with the king of england against the dignity of his crown and the interest of his kingdom he would not only be looked upon as an enemy to his country but as felo de se
from all which it is plain that as it is the best apology that can be made for the king of scots when he acts thus contrary to the honour and interest of himself and his country to say he is a prisoner in england so it is a sufficient justification of the people of scotland to refuse obedience to what he commands by the influence of the english or other councils in opposition to their interest because they are the commands of a captive and not of the king of scots
if our enemies say he is no captive but at liberty

to go to scotland if he pleases it is so far from making his case better that it makes it ten times worse for if his affections be captivated we are without remedy except we either sue for a divorce as in case of wilful desertion and denying conjugal duty or withdraw from under his roof and remove to another family as god and man will allow one sister to do that is oppressed and denied the privileges of paternal love and protection whilst another is caressed and dandled and has her fortune raised by diminishing that of the neglected sister
the jamaica proclamation against our colony at darien comes next to be considered and is as follows
by the honourable sir william beeston and commander in chief for his majesty in the island of jamaica and of the territories and dependencies of the same and admiral thereof

whereas have received orders from his majesty by the right honourable james vernon one of the principal secretaries of state importing that his majesty was not informed of the intentions and designs of the scots in peopling darien which is contrary to the peace between his majesty and his allies commanding me not to afford them any assistance in compliance therewith in his majesty's name and by his order do strictly charge and require all and every his majesty's subjects that upon no pretence whatsoever they hold any correspondence with the scots aforesaid

or give them any assistance with arms ammunition provision or any thing whatsoever either by themselves or any other for them nor assist them with any of their shipping or of the english nations upon pain of his majesty's displeasure and suffering the severest punishment

given under my hand and seal of arms the of april
and in the year of the reign of william the king of england scotland france and ireland and lord of jamaica defender of the faith
it contains a heavy charge against the scots company as having settled in darien without informing his majesty and having thereby broke the peace betwixt his majesty and his allies
as to their not intorming his majesty with their design there was neither any need of it nor had they reason to do it that there was no need of it is plain enough from the act of parliament impowering them to settle any where in asia africa or america upon places not inhabited or any other place with consent of the natives and not possess'd by any european potentate prince or state so that they were under no obligation to acquaint him where they design'd to settle provided they kept to the terms of the act
and that they had no cause so to do is evident from that unreasonable opposition that a faction of court had prevailed with him to make to them all along which gave them just cause to expect the like treatment in time to come

then as to the breach of the peace betwixt his majesty and his allies by the settlement they had no reason to think themselves guilty of any such thing and so much the less that dampier wafer and all others that wrote of the country gave an account

of the natives being in possession of their liberty and almost in continual wars with the spaniards
besides it was a rul'd case in england since capt sharp was by law acquitted in king charles il's time not only for having marched through darien in a hostile manner but for attacquing places that were really in possession of the spaniards as st maria and panama because he acted by virtue of a commission from those darien princes
this together with their not finding a spaniard or spanish garison on all that part of the isthmus was enough to justify the fairness of the scots settlement there and to have put a stop to this hasty sentence till both sides had been heard
but instead of that the advisers to this proclamation take upon them in a very magisterial manner to declare the scots guilty of a breach of the peace betwixt his majesty and his allies which is so much the more remarkable that this proclamation is publish'd in the before ever it was known what the scots could say in their own defence and sent away before the presenting of the spanish memorial which was on the third of may
and the proclamation bears date april
the unfairness of this proclamation is evident from this that at the very same time it is publish'd in the the lord president of the sessions and his majesty's advocate for the kingdom of scotland were sent for from hence to see what they could say to justify their pretensions to darien which they did by such arguments as have not yet been answer'd

we leave it then to the impartial thoughts of the good people of england whether we have not occasion to say that our king is in the hand of our enemies since we are thus condemn'd without

a hearing and our nation put tothe trouble and expence to send lawyers out of the kingdom to defend themselves before those that had already condemned them
and since this is a visible effect of the union of the crowns by which we are every day more and more oppressed let them speak their consciences if we have not all the reason in the world to dissolve that union except the nations be more closely united and upon a better footing
that we were so treated in former reigns we had no great cause to wonder when the court was engaged in a conspiracy against our religion and liberties
and our nation being inferior to none in their zeal for both it was but natural to think that we should be the first sacrifice but to be treated thus by a prince who hath ventur'd his life to save us from popery and slavery a prince who for courage in war and conduct in peace is not to be match'd in story a prince who is under god the great champion of our religion and the bold asserter of europe liberty a prince whose family we revere and whose person we adore a prince for whom we have so chearfully ventur'd our lives and lost so much of the best blood in our veins to be so treated by such a prince hath some thing cutting beyond expression and proves that our disasters are no way to be remedied but either by a total separation or a closer union of the two kingdoms

we cannot be so unjust to his majesty's character as to think a prince of his magnanimity could be guilty of so mean a thing as willingly to subject the crown of his antient kingdom which he received free to that of another
we cannot once suffer it to enter into our thoughts that he who dares to death in the field a thousand

times a day should act so unworthy a part as first to condemn and then to try us
these and all other things of that sort we must needs charge to the account of our enemies about him who misrepresent us and therefore surprise his majesty into any thing he does against us
as to that positive sentence of our having acted contrary to the peace betwixt his majesty and his allies we have all the reason in the world to complain of it
is our kingdom then become so mean and contemptible that what is transacted according to the acts of our parliaments and patents of our kings is liable to be annull'd or declared illegal by any person that has the hap to be made an english secretary of state governor of one of their american plantations or a member of their council of trade if it be so his majesty's dignity as king of scots is well defended in the mean time when it is liable thus to be trampled upon by his own servants as king of england
this does indeed verisy what has been said that our kings since the union leave their antient kingdom to the disposal of their servants but whether this be agreeable to the coronation oaths of our kings let them determine that are concern'd to enquire and perhaps it may be worth the consideration of our neighbours whether since we have been govern'd by servants they have not for the most part been subject to minions and that the one does naturally pave the way for the other
so that they are no great gainers by the bargain
if it be answer'd that the proclamations are issued by his majesty's authority and that therefore our sentence proceeds from his bar

we answer
that there are shrewd suspitions that a certain gentleman or two who have affected

all along to shew their zeal against the scots in this affair have push'd this matter beyond their instructions for there's no man that knows his majesty's justice and wisdom can admit a thought that he would condemn us before we were heard

we don't at all question his majesty's authority as king of england to forbid his english subjects to give any manner of assistance to the scots at darien tho we might say it was unkind but we absolutely deny that he has any authority as king of england to condemn the proceedings of the subjects of scotland for any thing they transact without the dominions of england
if it be otherwise his majesty as king of scots is bound to appear at the in for what he hath done as king of scots upon the lord chief justices summons and of what consequence this may be to himself or his successors may be easily judg'd
had oliver and the other regicides bethought themselves of this it had been more for the honour of england and would have taken off a great deal of the odium that is charg'd upon them for cutting off king charles had they search'd for something criminal in his conduct toward the english nation as king of scots and condemned him for that
tho they did not think upon this perhaps others may and then the english will be able to justify themselves as not having cut off their own king but their enemy the king of scots as there's no doubt they would have done by king charles ii had he not made his escape after the battel of worcester

this may perhaps deserve the thoughts of his present majesty and others concern'd in the succession and so much the more that the dependence of the crown of scotland upon that of england hath been lately asserted by some english

historians and indirectly hinted at in a pretended answer to the defence of the scots settlement at darien
but to satisfy that gentleman and others who please themselves so much in vilifying the scotish nation they may turn to the reigns of edward ii
iii and they will quickly find that sir william wallace robert bruce james lord douglas thomas randolph earl of murray and others that we could name did so gallantly defend the soveraignty of scotland against those bold pretenders to a superiority over us that their successors have had no great stomach to pursue their claim to it since so that if ever they had any it is forfeited by prescription
oliver imaginary conquest so much insisted on by the dull answerer of the scots defence and others will be of no use to the faction in this matter since that was no national quarrel nor did the english pretend to any such thing as a conquest of us but immediatly withdrew their forces upon the restoration
so that oliver conquest as he calls it was only the victory of one party over another in a civil war it being well known that he had friends in scotland as well as england which if that wise author will have oliver victories to be conquests he had conquerd too before ever he came near scotland
we don't insist upon this with any design to derogate from the valour of the english nation which is known all over the world but to stop the mouths of those pitiful scriblers and to give a caveat to those gentlemen about court who talk so big of conquering scotland upon this present occasion

but we wish them to consult beforehand how england in general stands affected to such a design

and how they will justify the lawfulness of it lest it fare with them as it did with charles and his cabal who not only in council advis'd to reduce us to our duty by force rather than give way to our demands as may be seen in the representation of the states of scotland in
but rais'd money and levied a formidable army to carry on their design and yet the hearts of these bravos fail'd them when they came in view of the scots who repuls'd them twice with shame the first time when they encamp'd their great army near barwick and the next when we charg'd them at newburn
and at last the best of the nobility and gentry of england thought fit to put a stop to those dangerous proceedings and follow'd his majesty with a protestation against them as well knowing that if scotland were once subdued the liberties of england could not be long liv'd
that it is the interest of england now to prevent the ruin of scotland as much as it was then will appear by the following arguments


that the present juncture of affairs makes it necessary for the kingdom of england rather to strengthen themselves by making new friends than by procuring new enemies
they are not ignorant that they have a controverted title to their crown entail'd upon them and that the pretenders against those in possession are in the french interest and under their protection
nor can they be ignorant that to the old national hatred betwixt france and england the french have added that of the protestant religion
of late years they have declared themselves the most implacable enemies of it and their king in all his triumphs has that ascrib'd to him as his greatest exploit that he hath quelled the monster of heresy
the case

being thus it must needs be against the interest of england to suffer any froward and headstrong faction to embroil them with scotland or to ruin that kingdom the consequence of which will be the exposing themselves as an easier prey to the conquest of the french or any other enemy

that the french had a hand in fomenting our late civil wars and made use of their firebrands in all parties is beyond dispute and that it is now more their interest to divide us than ever is so palpable that it cannot be denied
nothing in human probability could have stop'd the impetuous current of their arms but the interposition of great britain and therefore it concerns them both in point of interest and revenge to dash us against one another and if the ill usage that we meet with from the court of england should force us again into a french or other alliance the world cannot blame us since the laws of nature and nations are for us
put the case that a smaller number of christians should be unjustly attack'd by a greater whom nothing will satisfy but the utter ruin of the former could any man in conscience blame the weaker party to call in the assistance of jews and pagans to preserve their own lives is it not the same case with the scots have they not ever since the union of the crowns been oppressed and tyranniz'd over by a faction in england who will neither admit of an union of the nations nor leave the scots in possession of their own privileges as men and christians was it not a party in england that impos'd upon us first in matters of religion did we send first to oblige them to submit to the geneva disciplin as they call it or was it they that first imposed their ceremonies and forms of prayer upon us was it we who first invaded them with an army to subvert their civil and

religious liberties or did not they first invade us was it we who first made acts against their trade or they who made acts destructive of ours did we issue proclamations against their colonies or have they done so by ours in the name of god then let them declare what they would have us to do
they will not unite with us nor suffer us to live by our selves nor must we have any share of their trade or carry on a trade by our selves
is it not plain then that the faction oppress us and yet we must not complain of this sort of treatment

if the state of affairs in ireland be consider'd it will appear to be such as may make it dangerous to suffer the scots to be oppressed and provok'd in this manner it is well enough known that the people of ireland are not very well pleas'd with their treatment by some in england
this together with the great numbers of scots in the north of that kingdom who bear a natural affection to their country and would be very uneasy to see its ruin may prove of dangerous consequence in case of a rupture with scotland


it will further appear to be the interest of england not to suffer the scots to be so much run down if they consider the posture of their own affairs at home
the divisions and animosities betwixt the several parties in england are well enough known so that besides the sport it would afford to the common enemy of our religion and country to see those two nations engaged in war the enemies of the present government would be sure to improve it and watch for an opportunity to avenge themselves for what has been done against the late james and his friends
it is well enough known what hopes they and some people beyond sea conceive from the

differences that this treatment of the scots may probably occasion and as they have an irreconcilable hatred against our nation because we declar'd so generally against the late king and are so zealous for his present majesty there's no doubt but they will foment our divisions as much as they can and insinuate themselves with both parties in order to set them together by the ears
they know that so many as fall in england of those who adhere to the present constitution and so many as fall in scotland for supporting the trade and freedom of their country so many enemies they are rid of therefore there's no question but they promise themselves a plentiful fishing in such troubled waters
it likewise deserves the consideration of our neighbours that they don't stand at present in very good terms as to matter of trade with france holland and flanders nor is it well known what the issue of the present controversy with spain about regulating their succession may be
the impending differences betwixt the northern crowns may perhaps in a little time imbroil them with one or other of them and affect their trade also on that side
all which being consider'd it would seem to be the interest of england to assure themselves of the friendship of the scots by treating them in a kind and neighbourly manner


it will appear in particular not to be the interest of the dissenters and sober churchmen that the scots should be thus run down because their own ruin will be the unavoidable consequence of it
this they may soon be convinc'd of if they will give themselves leave to consider how they were treated in charles the first's time when the court did swell with so much rage against the kingdom of scotland for asserting their liberties

then as they do now
all those church of england that could not conform to the innovations brought into the church by laud and his party were treated as puritans and schismaticks and those that appear'd for the liberties of the nation against the and other arbitrary impositions of the court were treated as rebels and traitors
if they look into the two last reigns it will appear as plain as the sun that when scottand was oppress'd and their liberties wrested from them the dissenters and moderate churchmen in england were brought under the lash the former were depriv'd of their religion and liberties and the latter expos'd to destruction by because of their appearing for the laws of their country
we need mention no more instances to put this out of controversy than those deplorable ones of the earl of essex and lord russel to which we may add the shameful and barbarous treatment of the worthy mr johnson chaplain to the latter because he so excellently defended with his pen the and freedom of all true englishmen

from all this it will appear that england in general must suffer by the ruin of scotland and that those who have all along stood up for the english liberties must lay their account to come under the lash if once our necks come under the yoke therefore we dare appeal to the sober men of the church of england whether it be their interest that a nation which agrees with them in all the articles of their church those about discipline excepted should be destin'd to ruin because we believe with most of the reformed churches that there is no office superiour to that of a presbyter of divine institution
must we be denied the privileges of men and christians because we think

that the discipline of the church may be more safely intrusted and more faithfully administred by the joint indeavors of the minister and the heads of his congregation by an association of neighbouring ministers and the heads of their parishes and by delegates both of the clergy and laity of those associations in a general convocation than by another model but enough of this subject
let any man peruse the learned archbishop usher treatise of presbytery and episcopacy reconcil'd and there they will find that the difference is not so great as some people have made it their business to make the world believe
but if nothing less than our destruction will serve those gentlemen because our church is of a different constitution from that of england and that our political principles and original constitution are diametrically opposite to arbitrary power let the dissenters of england and all those churchmen that concurr'd in the late revolution look to it
when their neighbour's house is on sire it's time for them to prepare their bucket's
if this digression be thought impertinent and the answerer of the scots defence must bear the blame of it
they would insinuate to the world that the affair of our trade and colony is a presbyterian project on purpose to render it odious and suspected to the church of england therefore it was necessary to obviate that false and malicious suggestion and to acquaint our neighbours that the company make no difference as to the matter of perswasion and let it be put to the test when they please it will be found that those of the episcopal opinion are as zealous for the thriving of our trade and the honour of our nation both of which are concern'd in this affair as any of the other
to wind up this matter if any party in england entertain suspicions of us the better way to prevent us is to treat us kindly and enter into an union with us on such terms as his majesty and the parliament of both kingdoms shall agree and so as the civil and religious liberties of both people may be preserved
that will be casier and safer than to relie on the hopes of an uncertain conquest or if they don't think fit to do so it's but reasonable they should leave us in the undisturb'd possession of our own liberties but if they will do neither let them no more accuse those that complain of this treatment as incendiaries but seriously examine whether they themselves mayn't with more justice be accounted oppressors
part ii
being a more particular answer to libel
we come in the next place to take a survey of libel intituled the defence of the scots abdicating darien and shall speedily shew to how little purpose his suborners have spent their pains and mony on him

the first line of his performance is a banter upon his majesty whom he charges with investing our company with immense privileges and immunities by his octroy of
there's no man can be answerable for more sense than god has given him but tho understood no better his masters at of whom he brags so much ought to have taken care that he should not run into nonsense and an invective against his majesty at first dash to talk of granting us immense privileges is to impeach his majesty's wisdom as if he had done a thing without parallel which is directly to incense the kingdom of england against him as some bad people indeavour'd to do when by a misrepresentation of our design they stir'd up the house of commons against it
but had the surgeon or his suborners look'd into the privileges of years freedom from all manner of taxes granted to the dutch company by the states of holland and the vast immunities granted by the french king the danes and brandenburghers to their companies for trading to the or even

to those granted to the english company at first they would have found there was no reason to charge his majesty with granting us such immense or unparallel'd privileges or ascribing it to his not well knowing what he did for the noise of the guns at namur as this petulant scribler does
dedication pag
but if and his suborners exclaim against our privileges as immense they are resolv'd to diminish the authority by which they were granted and call it only by the name of an octroy which signifies no more than a patent whereas our privileges were granted us by an act of parliament which are greater and more sacred than all the octroys in europe thus thro ignorance or malice they think fit to vilify his majesty's conduct and authority which they pretend to defend
their malice is further demonstrated by the parenthesis to be presum'd in the page of the decation where they speak of his majesty's promise to interpose his royal authority to do us right in case of disturbance and that at the publick charge to be presum'd of his antient kingdom
there might possibly have been some need of their presumption had all mankind been indow'd with as little sense and honesty as and his suborners for no other body could ever presume it to mean any thing else since our acts do not oblige england tho if they had presum'd that our enemies would take eare that the said promise should not be kept the refusal of lending our company the men of war built at the charge of our own nation would soon have convine'd the world that they had presum'd too true

we have accounted for rejecting mr douglas's proposal elsewhere nor shall we take notice of scurrilous reflections on mr paterson

which only discover his own temper but do that honest man no hurt
as to his charging us with squandring away on hulks at amsterdam and hamburgh purely to make a noise of our proceedings we would desire him and his suborners to reconcile it with what they say from to
where they own themselves that the dutch and hamburgers were both mightily pleas'd with the design
that the dutch were tickled with the conceit that they should be sharers in the scots trade and
they say that that which gave the dead stroke to the scots design was the east and companies running open mouth'd to the lords of amsterdam shewing what was hatching by the scots commissioners in their city to ruine the trade of the vnited provinces

they tell us
that the hamburgers thought it the more their interest to embrace the project the more that the dutch oppos'd it
that our affair was generally favour'd by the burgers of hamburg and
that the government of england sent the senate of hamburg a caution by sir paul ricaut to take care how they suffer'd their burghers to embark with us
so that here we condemn them from their own mouths it being plain from those concessions that we did not idly squander away our money at hamburgh and amsterdam but that both those trading cities approv'd our design and would have engag'd in it had not the court of england and the dutch oppos'd it and therefore what loss of mony we sustain'd in those places must be charg'd to their account so that hath verified the proverb that liars have need of good memories

this is not the only instance wherein those of and his suborners have giv'n them the slip for in the page of the dedication they

upbraid the company with their blind project at which the trading part of the world stand amaz'd yet
they tell us that the project was reasonable both on the scots and hamburghers side and the reasons they give are these that the river on which that city stands is navigable for miles up into germany for vessels of or tuns which gives them an opportunity of serving all the north parts of the empire
all that they can say to salve this contradiction is that the hamburghers knew nothing of darien but builded altogether on ships laden with india goods but that's a notorious falshood for the hamburghers were actually told that our design was on the isthmus of america and therefore could not be disappointed in their expectations of an trade if they had a mind to have follow'd it since they could not be ignorant that they had thereby an opportunity of shortning the voyage from darien to the
but at the same time it is much to be question'd whether the hamburghers were so intent upon an trade as alledges since it must visibly prejudice their own manufacture of linen
we shall conclude this of hamburgh and amsterdam with one observation viz that he tells us
that one of the reasons why the dutch were so much taken with our trade was our exemption from duties for years which serves only to discover his own folly and malice since every body must necessarily know that exemption from duties was only in the scotish ports so that if they were exported from thence into any other country they must pay the same duties in those countries as if they had been directly imported from the

the inconsistency of and his suborners

is further demonstrated
bysupposing our buying a couple of ships in the thames and dispatching them to india with a sutable cargo
as to the buying of ships the company made that experiment but found themselves losevs by it and that it cost them more to fit up a secondhand vessel for their purpose than it would have done to have bought a new one
but with what front can they upbraid us with not buying of ships in the thames for carrying on an trade when they own
that the house of commons baulk'd us of our subscriptions and reprimanded the subjects of england for their foolery how is it possible then that they would have suffer'd our buying ships in the thames for carrying on an trade

we have another proof of his ingenuity and truth in that same page where he tells us that if our blind project meaning that of darien should miscarry by our own ill management it is not fair we should snarl at our neighbours who have no other hand in our misfortune than that they would not be accessary to any act which the world might judg felonious and wherein they could not join without engaging themselves in an unreasonable war and in the end to assist us with weapons to break our won heads
we wish his masters much joy of their advocat and evidence for we believe they could not have found such another if they had searched through all the island he just now own'd that our neighbours opposed our subscriptions at home and abroad before they knew any thing of what he calls our blind project and made us squander away to little purpose whioh certainly must be a misfortune and that wherein our neighbours had no small hand tho the world could not judg our taking subscriptions in that honourable

manner to be any way felonious
we have moreover sufficently proved it elsewhere that they have had a hand in our misfortune by opposition and unaccountable proclamations for which they had no authority we hope that this will be allow'd to be something more than refusing to be accessary to an act that neither he nor his suborners will ever be able to prove felonious and which we have already told him the laws of england have in a parallel nay much worse case judg'd to be honest and righteous
so that all this author hath got by his charging us maliciously with felony is to prove himself a wilful felon for he tells us at the end of his book of a long dispute betwixt himself and sir stewart his majesty's advocat for the kingdom of scotland about the title of the spaniards to darien and if we may believe he baffled the advocat and prov'd the right of the spaniards which proves himself to have engaged in a design that he thought felonious for we do not find by his own relation that he left the place from remorse of conscience but only on the account of a malladie imaginaire and want of provisions so that we thank him for telling the world from his own mouth that his evidence against us is that of a felon

as to their engaging themselves in an unreasonable war and assisting us with weapons to break their own heads we did not desire they should engage in a war for us but think it very unreasonable the english court should have engaged so far as they have done against us it had been sufficient for them to have denied us their assistance without having condemn'd us as guilty of breach of alliance which as all the other parts of the opposition made to us we are satisfied is

not the act of the english nation and therefore can create no misunderstanding betwixt them and us but perhaps may prove a weapon in time to break the heads of and his suborners
in the page that his book may be all of a piece he advances a forg'd obligation upon us from the union of the crowns which is that we are thereby deliver'd from the daily feuds and bloody little wars that rag'd amongst us for years which unnatural massacnes our native princes were unable to suppress
this is falshood in matter of fact for those feuds as he calls them ceas'd in the lowlands long before the union but continue still in the highlands which we can scarocly think is unknown to our author who was born so near that country as dumbarton
the macdonalds have been several times in arms against the earl of argile since the restoration and there's a fend now depending between the frazers and the murrays or rather the family of athol
non did we ever hear of any thing that look'd so like an unnatural massacre in scotland as that committed since tho revolution upon the inhabitants of glenco which had it not been for the union of the crowns would not have been suffer'd to go unpunished
but admitting it to be true that the union had deliver'd us from those little feuds we are no gainers by the bargain since it hath occasion'd greater pavticularly that unnatural feud which rag'd so long betwixt the episcopal party and presbyterians and had its rise altogether from the union of the crowns the very prospect of which was the sole cause why the earl of morton when regent set up the first protestant bishops in scotland

into what couvulsions that imposition threw the nation is well enough known and how besides the

bringing down charles with men against our kingdom and contributing to engage the nations in a civil war it occasioned king charles ii to plunder the west of scotland first by sir james turner which gave rise to the insurrection at pentland and twice afterwards by the highland host which occasion'd that of and afterwards the oppression run so high that it forc'd some of the presbyterians into unaccountable actions which gave occasion to oppress the whole party so that it was made punishable by death for any of their ministers to preach or for the people to hear them
from this indeed we were totally delivered by the revolution tho our freedom in that respect was partly begun by the late king james declaration
but our enemies unwilling that our nation should be long at ease have found other methods to set our court against us and because they know that his present majesty has too great a soul to persecute any man on the account of conscience our enemies have chang'd their battery and instead of pointing their cannon at our religion they level them against our civil liberties
the powder they prime their artillery with is that we are enemies to prerogative but because this would not go down with the good people of england who are strenuous assertors of liberty and property they must gild it over with the specious pretence that we have a design to undermine their trade and have unjustly invaded the spanish dominions
this is the design of and his suborners and therefore they insist so much on our clandestine declarations as they call them that we publish'd in the english plantations on purpose to drain them of their people but unhappily overthrow what they advance at the same time when they tell us that

the jamaica sloops were witnesses that we had neither provisions nor money for the sustenance of our own people pag
and therefore it cannot reasonably be suppos'd that we had any such design as he malicioufly charges us with to draw over the people from the english plantations since we had not wherewith to support our own but more of this anon
our author learn'd the maxim of calumniare audacter aliquid barebit when he was a papist and if he and his suborners can be any way instrumental to set the nations together by the ears by this method or if that fail if they can but raise animositys between them they know it will be a good pretence for some people to put his majesty upon pressing for a standing army and perhaps for having it enlarg'd it being necessary say they to overaw the scors but in reality to protect such evil counsellors from being brought to justice that have advis'd to such measures as visibly tend to the disadvantage of both nations

it may perhaps be worth the enquiry of our neighbours whether this be not the real meaning of this intolerable oppression exercis'd upon our nation as to their trade both at home and abroad viz that knowing our prafervidum
ingenium as they are pleas'd to call it to be impatient under tyranny the faction think thereby to provoke us to a resentment that may give occasion for raising an army against us which if it have the good hap to subdue us or force us to digest our oppresslon without any more to do shall be made use of afterwards to chastise themselves and bring them to better manners then to limit their monarchs in their grants and leave them no other troops but their garisons and guards
it was the observalton of the earl of shastsbury whom his enemies will own to have been a great statesman that

scotland is a door to let in good or evil upon england which is verified in the latter at least by the whole course of our history since the union for when james succeeded in trampling upon us he quickly began to huff his parliaments in england and notwithstanding all the remonstrances of church and state would needs have a popish match for his son tho he should sacrifice the great sir walter rawleigh his own daughter the queen of bohemia and her children together with the protestant interest in germany to make way for it
when charles obtain'd footing for his
impositions on the church and state of scotland it's well enough known what methods he took with england and how he sacrific'd the protestant interest in france whilst he eagerly pursued an arbitrary sway at home
when charles ii got his prerogative exalted and an army at his call allow'd him in scotland i'ts too late to be forgotten how he trod under foot the liberties of england seiz'd the charters of their cities cut off whom he would by and pav'd the way for popery and arbitrary power
when james ii did by his absolute power and unaccountable authority cass and annul all the laws establishing the reformation in sootland it was not long e're he suspended the laws imprison'd the bishops and fill'd with papists his council army and universities in england
from all which it is evident that our neighbours have reason to look to themselves when we are oppress'd for in all probability their acts of parliament will not be long regarded when ours are annull'd and made void by the intrigues of the courtiers and proclamations
the very advocats of tyranny make use of this as their herculean argument that the people having once resign'd their privileges to the crown

have no more right to demand them which tho we will not allow to be any ways concluding yet we may very well make use of it ad hominem that a pari ratione when once a prince has touch'd with his scepter a law for the benefit of his subjects it is not in his power to revoke or counteract it or if he do by the same power that he absolves himself from his obligation to protect and defend his subjects he absolves them from all obligation to pay him any revenue or allegiance
this is the birthright of all scots and if our neighbours in england have a mind to sit still and fee us bereft of it all the benefit they can expect from it is to have the privilege of being devour'd last

the rest of his banter upon his native country serves only to lessen his own credit and to make even those that set him at work curse him in thought not only as a monster in nature but as dishonest to them by depriving them thus of the benefit of his evidence for which they have paid him so well since no body in the world can think a man will have any regard to truth that in such an impudent manner breaks thro all the ties of nature and as a just judgment for so enormous a crime is so far depriv'd of his reasoning faculty that he is not sensible of his cutting his own throat by contradicting himself almost in every paragraph
he upbraids us in one page with not having dar'd to descend into the plains and that those gallant men our ancestors durst not assemble for worship before the union except in a house whose wall was twelve or foot thick or to whisper their prayers or carrols thro the cliffs of the mountains in the next page he tells us he has no inclination to offer any thing in opposition to the gallantry of our ancestors and in some pages following he impertinently ridicules the valour of our country in the

story of baliol which he perverts in such a manner as no man but himself is capable of
we don't think it worth while to answer him according to his folly but shall once for all let him know that the most invective of the english historians that wrote in the heat of the war do us more justice than this unnatural renegado
there's no nation in europe where we have not given proofs of our valour nor is there a court in christendom where scots are not valued on that account
sam
daniel one of the best of the english historians owns that never any people of the world did more gallantly defend their liberties than we did in that very instance of baliol when we were without a head and from thence infers what was it we could not have done had we been then under the conduct of such a leader as robert bruce
speed one of the gravest of the english historians does generously own that few great actions have been perform'd in europe where the scots have not been with the first and last in the field

we could easily give a proper reply to the impertinent romance which he brings about baliol that would tend as much or more to the dishonour of edward ii and iii than any thing that he and his suborners have suggested can tend to the dishonour of our nation but we forbear it having no design to reflect upon our neighbours notwithstanding the rude treatment and provocation that we have had from and others on this occasion
we can without thinking our selves injur'd own that the english are as brave men as any in the world and are satisfied that such of our neighbours as are men of honour and reading will allow us the same character
we perceive it is the design of this libeller and others to represent the english nation as enemies to us in this matter on

purpose to set us together by the ears but we are satisfied of the contrary as well knowing that not a few of our good neighbours are much surpriz'd and displeas'd with our treatment and look upon the same to be the effect of such councils as are destructive to the interest of both nations
we shall conclude this point with one observation more upon ignorance and malice in denying that the scots expell'd baliol from the crown when such a noble monument of the truth of it as the original letter of the states of scotland is still to be seen in the university of oxford and exemplify'd by dr burnet now bishop of sarum in his history of the reformation and since it is also plain that our ancestors chose robert bruce king during baliol and that baliol at last resign'd all his pretensions confess'd his fault in subjecting the crown of scotland to that of england own'd that he was deservedly thrust from the throne for it congratulated his kinsman robert bruce advancement and that he had restor'd the crown of scotland to its antient honour

we take no notice of his profane and atheistical banter upon the religion of our country as being satisfied that that will do his cause no good amongst thinking men tho it may please those that he is only fit to converse with
as for his malicious charge on presbyterians that they maintain it as their principle that dominion is founded on grace it's of a piece with the rest of his evidence
he and his suborners will be very hard put to it to quote one of their authors to prove the assertion and therefore they may well reject it as a slander but we must tell him that if this be the principle of the presbyterians they have not well answer'd it by their practice for whenever they had any such thing as dominion at their disposal

they seldom had the good hap to confer it upon those that had grace enough to answer the ends of it
we forbear instances because it's too well known both in france and great britain
we come next to examine his charge upon our colony on purpose to render them odious to the english nation and all the world and shall transcribe it verbatim that the reason of our observations upon it may be the more obvious
his words are these
if your colony has left darien for reasons not as yet public to the world tis your fault right worshipful gentlemen in undertaking to manage a project you so little understood and not of the english nation whose interest it is to abvance and preserve their own colonies and to keep them from being render'd desolate by the clandestine artisices of yours who industriously and tacitely spread their declarations over all the english islands and plantations making use of the king of great britain's name to give more authority to the thing and by those indirect manifestos such profits or rather plunders were insinuated that if the government of england had not taken early measures to prevent the ill consequences it's to be question'd whether the greatest part of the english west indies had not e're now quitted their settlements and been decoyed into your colony under a cover'd notion that you had a patent from the king to pick a quarrel with the spaniard and to divide the spoil of mexico and peru amongst the servants and adventurers of the company
this indeed is something to the purpose and might deserve the suborners mony were there no possibility of proving it false but we shall see anon what ground there is for this bold accusation after observing

that perhaps some gentlemen at the west end of the town may find at that their evidence has blab'd out something more in this paragraph than it's for their interest the world should know
we will only ask mr some civil questions what are those reasons not as yet publick to the world for which our colony left darien sir william beeston letter acquainted us that it was for want of provisions and for fear of the great preparations by the spaniards the letters we have had since from say that it was for want of provisions and because they were brought to their wits end and did not know what to think of their case by reason of the english proclamations
then since the very first of these and much more all of them together were reason sufficient and are publick to the world what other private reasons can mr give us for it we know he boasts of his interest in those that are concerned in the secrets of the west end of the town did they tell him then that the government of england took early measures to prevent the ill consequences of our colony if they did so pray what were those measures was the sending of capt long thither to debauch our men traduce us to the indians as pirats and to tell them his majesty of great britain would not protect us one of those early measures was not their solliciting a foreign minister to present a memorial against our colony as soon as ever the news of it arriv'd another and was not this the reason why they put it upon that minister and not upon the spanish ambassador that the latter had been forbid coming to court because his catholick majesty would not admit of schonenburg the the jew as envoy from the dutch were not the enemies of the scots company so zealous in promoting

that memorial that they could not have patience till orders came from madrid but put the envoy upon it of themselves and when a controversy happen'd about receiving it signed or unsign'd because of the difference betwixt the two courts did not our enemies agree to it as an expedient that one of both sorts should be presented was not this abominable trifling upon a point of honour when they were plotting to bereave the kingdom of scotland of their honour men mony and colony all at once were not these more clandestine and indirect artifices to destroy our colony than any he charges upon us to destroy the english colonies having ask'd mr more questions than he and his suborners dare positively answer we come next to deny his charge upon our colony as being malicious and absolutely false for which their own declaration shall be our evidence and is as follows
caledonia the declaration of the council constitured by the indian and african company of scotland for the government and direction of their colonies and settlements in the indies
the said company pursuant to the powers and immunities granted unto them by his majesty of great britain our soveraign lord with advice and consent of his parliament of scotland having granted and conceded unto us and our successors in the government for all times hereafter full power to equip set out freight and navigate our own or hired ships in warlike or other manner from any ports or places in amity or not in hostility with his majesty to any lands islands countries or places in asia africa or america and there to plant colonies build cities towns or forts in or upon the places not inhabited or in or upon any other place by consent of the natives or inhabitants thereof and not possest by any european soveraign potentate prince or state and to provide and furnish the aforesaid places cities towns or forts with magazines ordinance arms weapons ammunition and stores of war and by force of arms to defend the same trade navigation colonies cities towns forts plantations and other effects whatsoever and likewise to make reprizals and to seek and take reparation of damage done by sea or by land and to make and conclude treaties of peace and commerce with soveraign princes estates rulers governours or proprietors of the aforesaid lands istands countries or places in asia africa or america

and the chief captains and supream leaders of the people of darien in compliance with former agresments having now in most kind and obliging mannet received us into their friendship and country with promise and contract to assist and join in defence thereof against such as shall be their or our enemies in any time to come which besides its being one of the most healthful rich and fruitful
countries upon earth hath the advantage of being a narrow isthmus seated in the heighth of the world between two vast oceans which renders it more convenient than any other for being the common of the insearchable and immense treasures of the spacious south seas the door of commerce to china and japan and the emporium and staple for the trade of both indies
and now by virtue of the powers to us given
we do here settle and in the name of god establish our selves end in honour and for the momory of that most antient and renowned name of our mother kingdom we do and will from call this country by the name of caledonia and our selves successors and associates by the name of caledonians

decemb


by order of the council hugh ross secretary
we dare refer it to the scrutiny of the nicest observers whether this declaration infer any such thing as plunder or a patent from the king to pick a quarrel with the spaniards and to divide the spoil of mexico and peru what clandestine artifices are here to be found to drain the english plantations and wherein does it interfere with the interest of england any more than all free ports must of necessity interfere with their neighbours we wish that our author would inform us how publick declarations according to act of parliament can be call'd clandestine artisices and defy him and his suborners with all their art to find any thing pretended to in this declaration but what the colony has a right to by act of parliament
the only thing this malicious scribler can wrest to his purpose in the declaration is the colony's publishing that all manner of persons of what nation or people soever should be equally free and alike capable of the same privileges with themselves which are the express words of the act of parliament and therefore supposing that the said declaration should have influenc'd some people to come over to them from the english plantations the colony could not be any ways blam'd for it
qui utitur jure suo nil damni facit is a known maxim in maw

the libeller's malice is not satisfied with reflecting upon our colony but flies on the face of the greatest part of the english in the as if they had so little honour or love for their native country as to lay their own plantations desolate and run over to ours
indeed if most of them be such persons as himself there might be some ground for the reflection but till it appears to be so we must beg mr

leave to have a better opinion of them
no man of sense can believe that those who found themselves at ease in the english plantations would be fond of removing to a new colony but if others who are at their freedom had a mind to do so we know of no reason they should be hinder'd
the subjects of england are a free people and not confin'd to their own dominions but have liberty to trade and live elsewhere if they find their account in it
there's no man can blame the scots for publishing their declaration throughout the the thing being absolutely necessary in it self and the natural practice of all new settlements to acquaint the world with the nature of their design and on what terms they may have commerce with them
we hope our author and his suborners will not say that the subjects of england might not have traded with them for their own advantage provided their title had been unexceptionable and seeing the scots had reason to think it so it was no act of unkindness in them to let the english plantations know that they should be very welcome to trade to darien and how this could be done so properly and with so much effect as by declaration our author would do well to acquaint us

the gentleman and his friends are very angry that we should have made use of the king of great britain name to give the more authority to the thing
we would very fain know their reasons why it is not as lawful for the scots to make use of that name as the english and at the same time must take leave to tell the renegado and his whitehall friends that all this venom they have spit at the scots colony is a virulent invective against his majesty
he impower'd them

to do what they accuse them for by act of parliament and because our antagonists have a mind to say that this octroy as they call it was destructive to the trade of england they find themselves oblig'd to make an excuse for the king viz that the honest gentleman meant no harm at the granting of it for it is to be believ'd that he could scarce bear what was whisper'd for the noise of the namur guns which is in plain english he gave his consent to he knew not what
a noble defence for which his majesty is oblig'd to them but banter and blasphemy they were fully resolv'd on and so they had but a subject they car'd not what
nor adam nor david nay nor the almighty himself shall escape them but his commission to the hebrews when they departed out of egypt must come in to make up the profane jest thus heavn it self shall be charg'd at last with founding dominion upon grace and giving the elect a divine right to the goods of the wicked after its being first thrown as a killing reflection at the heads of the poor presbyterians
will needs insist upon it in his dedication that our project on darien was so secretly carried on that it was not known to england till the same wind that brought the news likewise inform'd the nation that the scots were march'd over to panama and had planted guns against it but unhappily forgets himself and tells us pag
of his book that paterson communicated it to some select heads in england that were able to bear it
and we can tell him further that it was so well known to some in england that they sent capt long the quaker on purpose to prevent us and to do us all the mischief he could and accordingly he was on that coast a month before us tho he did not land any men till afterwards
as for the news

of the scots having planted cannon against panama it's the first time we ever heard on't and therefore must charge it upon the author amongst the rest of his forgeries
there was indeed a report brought over by the dutch gazetts which we suppose was inserted on purpose by our good friends in holland to render us odious that we had plundered panama but that was a long time after the news of our arrival at darien and fram'd on purpose as we have reason to believe to justify the proclamations that some gentlemen at the west end of the town had sent to the against us for we know they can have what they please put in the dutch gazetts and that perhaps may be one main reason why they have been altogether silent as to the matter in their own
but that which sufficiently discovers the falshood of this malicious insinuation as if we had a design to attaque panama or any other place belonging to the spaniards is mr paterson letter to his friend at boston in and sent us thence in print dated at fort st andrew in caledonia february

above fifteen weeks after the arrival of our colony wherein he acquaints that gentleman that they had written to the president of panama giving him an account of our good and peaceable intentions and to procure a good understanding and correspondence
the letter it self is as follows
an abstract of a letter from a person of eminence and worth in caledonia to a friend at boston in
have received your kind letter of the of december last and communicated it to the gentlemen of the council here to whom your kind sentiments and readiness were very acceptable
certainly the work here begun is the most ripened digested and the best founded as to privileges place time and other like advantages that was ever yet begun in any part of the trading world
we arrived upon this coast the first and took possession the third of november our situation is about two leagues to the southward of by the spaniards called guarda in one of the best and most defence able harbours perhaps in the world
the country is healthful to a wonder insomuch that our own sick which were many when we arrived are now generally cured
the country is exceeding fertil and the weather temperate the country where we are settled is dry and rising ground hills but not high and on the sides and quite to the tops three four or five foot good fat mould not a rock or stone to be seen
we have but eight or nine leagues to a river where boats may go into the
the natives for fifty leagues on either side are in intire friendship and correspondence with us and if we will be at the pains we can gain those at the greatest distance
for our neighbour indians are willing to be the joyful messengers of our settlement and good disposition to their
as to the innate riches of the country upon the first information always believed it to be very great but now find it goes beyond all that ever thought or conceited in that matter
the spaniards as we can understand are very much surprized and alarm'd and the more that it comes as a upon them having had no notice of us until three days after our arrival
we have written to the president of panama giving him account of our good and peaceable intentions and to procure a good understanding

and correspondence and if that is not condescended to we are ready for what else he pleases
if merchants should once erect factories here this place will soon become the best and surest mart in all america both for and trade
we want here sloops and coasting vessels for want of which and by reason we have all hands at work in fortifying and futing our selves which is now pretty well over we have had but little trade as yet most of our goods unsold
we are here a thousand one hundred men and expect supplies every day
we have been exceeding unhappy in losing two ministers who came with us from scotland and if could supply us in that it would be a great and lasting obligation

fort st andrew february
a farther proof of the falshood of this insinuation is capt pennicook journal sent to the company over england and dated decem
almost two months before this letter to wherein they give an account of the information they had from several hands that the spaniards were marching with men from panama to attacque them by land whilst their men of war were to attacque them by sea upon which they did all they could to put themselves in a posture of defence against them so far were they from any design of marching towards panama
the matter being so suborners have lost their argument from this topic also to justify their proceedings against us

he goes on to tell us that england had no reason to go to war with the spaniards on the score of our company who besides all the loss of their trade must throw away more english pounds thrice over than there scotch in our capital stock and he will leave it to any man of half an ounce of politicks to find out

the jest on't save this author of our colony's defence

mr and his suborners may please to know that we neither desir'd nor expected that england should go to war with the spaniards on the account of our company and had as little reason to expect that a faction in england for we will not be so unjust as to charge it upon the nation should go to war with us on account of the spaniards before we could be heard in our own defence we mean that proclamations should have been publish'd in the inferring that the king of england has a power to declare that to be a breach of the peace that is done by the authority of the king of scotland that they should thereby forbid their subjects of england to entertain any commerce with us refuse us provisions for commodities in our distress except we will bring our ships under the guns of their fort at punish their subjects for entertaining commerce with us and threatning to lay the commanders of our ships in irons if they offer to put in for refreshment or to refit after a storm as they did to capt jamison at nevis
that this wants very little of going to war with the scots we believe most thinking men are very well satisfied but whether it be so or not we will venture to tell the renegado and his suborners that by this kind of procedure against the scots as if we were servants and subjects to england some gentlemen in and about have giv'n the spaniards just occasion to make war upon england if they were able or at least to make reprisals upon the english for the damage they pretend to have suffer'd from the scots whom the english court by this sort of treatment have declar'd to be their subjects whereas if they had

not invaded the soveraignty of scotland the spaniards could have had no such pretonce
now whether men that had been endow'd with a quarter of an ounce of politicks would have been guilty of such a false step as this let our author's suborners determine
and besides we must tell them that the men whom capt long had set ashore with capt diego in the gulph of darien committed the first hostility on the spaniards and kill'd seven of them with a design for any thing we know to trapan us into a war with the spaniards since one of the same fellows came to our colony afterwards for powder and shot which our men wisely deny'd them and told them they had done what they could not justify
the author of the defence of the scots settlement dos no where advise the english to a war with spain on the score of our company but gives such arguments to prove that they had no reason to dread the effects if spain should make war with them on that account and that it was the interest of england to have supported the scots in that settlement as have not yet been answer'd and therefore we shall say nothing farther of it here
our author and his friends are pleas'd to call our apprechensions of the places being possess'd by the french bugbear stories because the french have another game to play at present with spain or might have secur'd carthagena when they had it in their power and that if france or holland had any such design they may go sit down within a league of either side of our colony with as good a title as ours

but that the french are genetally wiser than to lay out their mony upon such tools as this author appears to be by his way of argning one would

be apt to think he had touch'd some leuidor's
does he conceive that the french understood their interest so little during the war that threatned their ruine as to settle a colony in the at a time when they stood in more need of them at home to defend their own country and cultivate their ground and vineyards is it not known that their design was on the spanish plate in order to enable them to continue the war and not on the spanish plantations which they were in no capacity to defend against the spaniards and their allies if they had at that time seiz'd any of them does our author and his suborners think that xiv did not understand his interest better than to offer at a settlement in the spanish especially at a place of such importance as carthagena and thereby have give the english and dutch an opportunity of settling there themselves by coming to drive him out could he think that the two nations of europe that have the greatest naval force and were most concern'd of any to reduce him to reason would sit still and suffer him to seize the spanish treafures and by that means enable himself to bring all europe under his yoke it is impossible such a thought could ever enter into his mind and therefore he had very good reason to forbear keeping possession of carthagena since twould have been the ready way to have spoil'd his future pretensions to the in case of the of spain death which every body then expected daily
and whenever it happens if he die without issue as there's great odds he will we stand in need of better guarantees than and his suborners that the fr king will not seize the spanish and darien into boot against which there are

those who have studied politicks as much as our author who are of opinion that the settlement at darien might have been no contemptible barrier
the scribler takes upon him to pafs his word for his majesty that the scots crown will receive no blemish or disreputation by his wearing it
we believe his majesty will scarcely thank him for his security and we are satisfied our nation will as little rely on it
but at the same time we must tell this gentleman and his suborners that we had as little reason to suspect that charles who was a native of scotland would have dishonour'd our crown so far as to order it to be brought to england and therefore it is not imposfible for princes to be by ill council to do such things as are inconsistent with the honour of their crowns
and thus some will venture to say that the crown of scotland was no ways honour'd when the dutch troops took place of the king of scots guards and when the king of england takes upon him to condemn by proclamations what the king of scotland has approv'd by act of parliament and letters patent
the scribler comes next to give us a taste of his skill in the brittish history he brags of so much by telling us the fate of some great scots families that swell'd beyond their proportion
his instances of the cummins and gouries sufficiently discover his ignorance of the scotish history
the former was indeed a very great family but are an inauspicious instance for him and those of his kidney their ruin not being occasion'd by their greatness but by joying with the enemies of our nation as this renegado does
as for his application of his instances it serves to discover the malicious designs of himself and suborners against the two greatest families that are now left in scotland
the kind treatment this author met with from one of these great men upon his arrival after having deserted our colony would have oblig'd any but a monster of ingratitude to have forborn such a causeless and invenom'd reflection which nothing but ingrain'd malice can suggest
we come in the next place to take a view of the book it self
in the very first page he owns he is no friend to the scots company and alledges he has more reason for it than those skeletons that are starved to death
this we hope is sufficient to shew what credit is to be given to his narrative wherein tho he promises to keep close to matter of fact he abounds with blasphemous and impertinent digressions one of the first we shall take notice of is his unmannerly reflection on the city of london pag
as a place where matter is never wanting to exercise plodding heads
which is so near a kin to the language of the faction that in the late reigns aim'd at the destruction of that noble emporium which deserves to be the mistress of the universe that we cannot in the least doubt but it proceeds from the same spirit
of the same nature is his reflection pag
upon the london subscribers who came in so fast to the scots company that he thought himself the happiest man that could get his name first down in our books which is a plain demonstration that those eager subscribers thought the design no way prejudicial to the interest of their country for upon enquiry it will be found that most of them were such as had zealously appear'd for its liberty in former reigns
his malicious reflection in that same page as if the company had promis'd to paterson smith and lodg to engage subscriptions in england and the hans is notoriously false they had not one farthing promis'd them tho to be sure the company would have rewarded them for their pains and service as it was reasonable they should besides it appears by the eagerness of the english and hamburgers to subscribe until they were prevented by their respective governments that there was no occasion for such a bribe to bring in subscriptions
his reflection pag
of our printing the address of the commons at edinburgh but not the king's answer admitting it to be true is so far from being criminal that it rather argues the greatest respect imaginable for his majesty whom we would not lessen in the esteem of the people of scotland who knew they had a natural right to claim and expect his protection
his owning in that same page that the company's books had not been long open'd in edinburgh till was sign'd and that all sorts of people whom he is pleas'd to express under the scurrilous denomination of poor blind and lame crouded in with their subscriptions serves to confute his foregoing and following reflections that the company was obliged to promise to procure subscriptions and to go where the money lay viz to holland and the towns especially since he owns himself
that they were baulk'd of their subscriptions in england and holland and had not one groat of the hamburgers money

his reflection upon mr paterson pag
whom he blasphemously calls the man paterson alluding to the apostles calling our saviour the man christs

is altogether false he always propos'd the paying half the subscriptions and most of the subscribers were resolved to pay the whole as it appears they have already a considerable part of it by their having sent away three convoys and being busy in preparing a fourth
his irreligious and atheistical temper appears further by his reflecting upon their expecting good returns by the old cant of god's blessing as if it were possible to look for success in any thing without the divine benediction or ridiculous to express our dependency on it
but it seems his suborners are resolv'd that our nation shall be huff'd banter'd and blasphem'd out of all their rights as men and christians
his next reflection
of our sending persons to build six ships of fifty guns apiece at amsterdam and hamburgh to prepossess the dutchmen with a kind opinion of the company and thereby make it appear how willing we were to extend the warm rays of our octroy to people who deserv'd it better than our ungrateful neighbours is malicious to the highest degree
he and his suborners very well know that we could neither build nor buy in england because of the opposition made to us there and since tis known that they can build cheaper in hamburgh and holland than in england our offering first to lay out our money with our neighbours and not going beyond sea till we were compell'd to it is a proof from his own mouth that we had no other but friendly intentions towards the english nation

his insinuation of the difference betwixt the kirk and church parties about each of them imploying their own instruments shews more malice than wisdom since admitting people of different perswasions into companies is practised in all trading

parts of the world and particularly in england where the dissenters have no small share in all their funds and companies but by this they may see what fair treatment they are to expect if and his suborners could get their wills
the old popish maxim would soon be brought into practice that no man should have leave to buy or sell but he that is of the public religion
his next story of our debate about entrusting any man that was fed on english beef and pudding with for the use of our delegates abroad is equally scurrilous and false
we trusted no man but mr paterson with that money and did not think it sit that every subscriber but that only a special committee should know how that money was to be imploy'd
nor can this be charg'd upon us as a piece of foolish confidence in mr paterson whom the scribler owns to have been intrusted with laying the foundation of the bank of england tho ill rewarded for it
his malicious calumny that mr paterson did afterwards form the darien project to be reveng'd on the english nation is sufficiently falsified by his and our first offers to take in the english as joint subscribers after the said project was actually form'd and imparted to some select heads as he himself owns

as to smith cheating us of it was our misfortune not our crime as is manifest from our diligence in recovering of it
this renedo's saying
that smith deservedly bubled us argues himself to be as great a cheat as smith and there's little reason to doubt but he defrauded the company as far as opportunity would allow him when intrusted as purser with their stores from hamburgh and elsewhere which he seems to own himself when he boasts of his bringing

home as much from darien as any of the counsellors
his assertion
that capt gibson was cheated of the per cent commission money is a shameless falshood the captain was satisfied and rewarded to his own content

the next proof we have of the ingenuity of this renegado and his suborners is
where he tells us that paterson being in drink babbled out a secret of the company at camphire viz
that their act empowered them to give commissions to any kind of people without asking their nation to trade to the indies under scots colours and that such people might dispose of their india goods where they pleas'd providing they made a sham entry in scotland
to say that this was a secret of the company and in the same breath to inform the world that mr paterson said they were impowered to do so by their act which was every where publick and in print is like the rest of the libeller's inconsistencies but his suborners and he were so far transported with malice that they resolv'd to dress our act of parliament throughout in the disguise of a cheat and charge it upon the company as secret intrigues without ever considering that the act it self would discover their falshood and malice
the clause of the act is as follows and that the said company may by virtue hereof grant and delegate such rights properties powers and immunities and permit and allow such sort of trade commerce and navigation into their plantations colonies cities towns or places of their possession as the said company shall from time to time judg sit and convenient

these being the very words of the act the dutch could not be impos'd upon in that manner by

mr paterson if he had been so minded or had he been drunk as the libeller says when he told the story they must have been very weak men that would offer to sign upon the words of a drunken man without seeing the act it self
it is not to be doubted but this clause impowers the company to allow such a trade as mentions and therefore it might be proper enough for mr paterson to urge it as an argument to engage subseribers but that he could do it in these terms that here sets down there's no ground to believe and therefore his answer to those that would not sign but on that bottom that the company had no occasion to make use of that power at present was very proper
the story of the sham entry in scotland paying per cent to the company and thereby underselling the english and dutch per cent is so void of all sense that it would seem the libeller and his suborners were drunk when they suggested it
the act does indeed oblige such ships as were imploy'd by the company to break bulk in scotland but lays no such obligation upon those that they might impower to trade to their colony and considering what has been already said of the drawbacks that the cargo of the said ships was no where but in scotland and that by his own concession they were to pay per cent at least to the company how was it possible they could undersel the english and dutch per cent especially considering the vast quantities that those two companies buy at a time and by consequence were like to have the prime cost easier than our infant company

after all this sham story he happens to tell the main reason of the miscarriage of our design in

holland and perhaps of its doing so in england
the dutch east and west india companies says he complain'd to the lords of amsterdam that the scots commissioners were designing the ruin of their trade
which by the way shews that the project of an american trade was discours'd of by the commissioners which the libeller it's probable would not have mention'd had not his memory given him the slip and that he forgot he had formerly told us that the darien project was still kept secret
why then should the dutch company be so much concerned at our taking subscriptions there but that they knew we had a design on the isthmus of america and therefore their company knowing also that we being once masters of a good settlement there it would have abridg'd the way and made voyages speedier to china japan the philippine islands where their trade lies they thought it might in time be dangerous for them if that isthmus should be possess'd by the subjects of great britain
so that there's no reason to doubt but they found interest enough at the west end of the town to lay as many rubs in our way as was possible to be done

the libellers give us another evidence of their candor and ingenuity when they tell us the hamburghers knew nothing of darien but builded altogether on ships laden with india goods whereof their city and port was to be the receptacle and mart whilst paterson wanted only mony to raise forces to overrun mexico and peru
but our author and his suborners ought to have consider'd that since they have told us of the fears of the dutch company we could easily infer that the project of the isthmus could not be long conceal'd from the hamburghers that the

act it self would satisfy the subscribers there that the company's ships must break bulk in scotland and therefore they could not expect to be the receptacle and mart of our stores whatever they might hope for as to conveying the merchandize to the inland places of germany they could not but think that we had shipping of our own to carry our goods to the ports on the baltick and german sea

in that same page they give us another hint to confirm our suspicion that it is more from the apprehensions of our lessening the dutch than the english trade that the court have so violently oppos'd us viz that the hamburghers by joining with the scots had a prospect of worming the hollander out of a good part of the german trade
which admitting to be true the hollanders had none but themselves to blame for it since we offer'd to take them in as joint subscribers before we made any proposal to the hamburghers nor is it any ways unreasonable in it self that germans should have the preference of other nations in trading with germany
after a great deal of prophane banter and ridiculing the sacred text he tells us that the human reason of our disappointment was an unnecessary paragraph in our octroy which occasion'd a great many english and holland speculations viz
that in case the company should be interrupted in their trade the king had ingaged to interpose the royal authority to do them right and that at the public charge which says he paterson and the rest insinuated in all companies that the king was to assist and defend them with his ships of war or otherwise if there was occasion and that out of his own pocket which they did not question to be english coin

there's no reasonable man will think it unnecessary that a prince should protect his subjects in their trade either by his men of war or otherwise and therefore this being a clause of the act of parliament it was no ways unnecessary to be put into the patent and we will adventure to tell and his suborners that they who advis'd his majesty to refuse our company the three men of war built at our own charge when they offer'd to be at the expence of maintaining them have advis'd him to act contrary to the trust repos'd in him as king of scots and to contravene this very act of parliament and that which order'd those ships to be built for defence of trade than which there cannot be a more false step in government for when once people perceive that princes have no regard to the laws made for the protection and welfare of the subject they will naturally think themselves absolv'd from such as require their allegiance and support of the soveraign
that mr paterson and the scots company should insinuate from the octroy that we were to be assisted or defended by english men of war or money is nothing but a mixture of falshood and malice
the libeller owns that the words of our act cannot bear it and the world knows that our parliaments never pretend to dispose of english ships or mony and therefore no man of sense will believe this renegado when he says the scots company put that gloss on the text for their own advantage since that had been directly to expose themselves
for we are not to suppose they could think the dutch and hamburghers so weak as not to peruse the act it self which would soon have undeceived them therefore all those reflections which he protends the english traders to india

made upon it must vanish of course as having no manner of foundation
much less can they serve to justify the memorial given in at hamburgh by sir paul ricaut against our taking subscriptions there which memorial tho minc'd by our libeller yet ev'n as he represents it is against the law of nations and indeed scarcely reconcileable to good sense in the first place to call our agents private men who acted by the company's authority and according to act of parliament and in the next place to suppose that the hamburghers could possibly join with us in hopes of english protection when the opposition made to us by the court of england was known all over europe nay the scribler himself owns
that the more opposition the english and dutch offer'd to the project the more the hamburghers thought it their interest to embrace it
this is sufficient to convince the suborners that the next time they hire a scribler to belie the scots company they must be sure to pitch upon one that has a better memory

his next reflections
that our ships were neither fit for trade nor war that our cargo was not proper that our main design was the buccaneer trade that above was deficient of the first payments and most of the subscribers not able to raise their quota are equally false with the rest
the ships for their burden and size are as fit either for trade or war as any in europe
the cargo of cloth stuffs shoes stockins slippers and wigs must needs be proper for a country where the natives go naked for want of apparel and fit to be exchanged for other commodities either in the english dutch french or spanish plantations

for bibles we suppose our libeller would rather we had carried mass books yet others will be of opinion that of em was no unfit cargo our own colony might have dispens'd with that number in a little time nor were they unfit to have been put into the hands of such of the natives especially of the younger sort that might learn our language
for hoes axes macheet knives they were absolutely necessary for our selves and a commodity much valued by the natives
fifteen hundred square buccaneer pieces and proportionable ammunition was no such extraordinary store for eleven or twelve hundred men and whereas he maliciously insinuates that buccaneering was our main design the event hath prov'd it to be false had that been our intent we might easily have invaded the spanish plantations at both ends of the isthmus sancta maria nor panama it self could never have been able to withstand such a force when a few undisciplin'd buccaneers did so easily take them
it's well enough known there was a parcel of as brave men that went with our fleet as perhaps great britain could afford many of em inur'd to war and fatigues and knew how to look an enemy in the face without being daunted
they had giv'n proofs enough of that in flanders where no men alive could fight with more bravery and zeal than they did for the common cause tho some people have since thought sit to starve them
that there was above of the not paid in is false there was not above wanting
for those great men that thought their countenance enough and therefore refus'd to pay in their subscriptions he shall have our leave to name

them but perhaps his suborners will not care to have their friends so much expos'd
that most of the subscribers were unable to raise their quota is demonstrably false by our sending away two convoys since the thirds being greater by far than the first and that we are now preparing a fourth
as to the companies charging per cent advance on every article of the stock it's well enough known that so much advance is thought nothing in a trade it was all the profit
the company was to have and only charged in the books by way of formality that the colony might know what they were indebted to the company

his story
of its being propos'd in the company to sell off their ships and cargo and divide the product amongst the subscribers is nothing eul our dishonour nor at all to be wondred at considering the unreasonable opposition we had met with from court
that we rejected it as inglorious argues still that we are not so as he elsewhere represents us
his base reflections
on the company as if they had despair'd of the design and sent their men to sea on purpose to perish and on drummellier that be order'd the colony to get mony honestly if they could but be sure to get it and if they came home without it then the devil get them all serve only to discover his own temper and that he thinks all men act and speak like himself
we have faid enough already to demonstrate the honesty of both company and colony had their design been to get mony without regard to honesty they would not have been starv'd to death by the proclamations and other opposition made them at court they could quickly

have possessed themselves of the spanish mines which the scribler owns
were within twelve leagues of them and with much more ease of the that was sunk in the french ship
but he serves the suborners for their mony much at the same rate he did the scots company
his reflection
that mr stratford was oblig'd to arrest our ships at hamburgh for flemish as they were fitting out serves only to discover his own malice and folly mr stratford had very good security for flemish when he had four ships in port not yet fitted out and his receiving his mony in a fortnight or three weeks as the libeller owns in the same paragraph shows he had no ill paymasters to deal with
it were well for england if all those that have been imployed in the royal navy could say as much by his suborners and their friends
as for our discharging mr stratford to be any longer our cashier there's no need of assigning any other cause for it but that sr paul ricaut memorial render'd it needless and to that same account we must charge the two ships that were left there to rot in their ouse
but at the same time we will tell him we had no great reason to be satisfied with mr stratford conduct and believe we have less now than ever since this libeller defends him

his story of mr henderson's arresting another of our ships for is sufficiently answer'd by himself when he tells us that he and his partners fail'd in their subscriptions which was a just debt due to the company and therefore they had reason to demand and expect it especially he being a scots yet the company

dealt very kindly with him on that account and so much the more that they consider'd his being a residenter in holland where he was liable both to the english and dutch court to whose account the libeller must also charge this affront and the loss we sustain'd at amsterdam
what he says of our seamen
is a manifest untruth
they were immediately paid extreamly well satisfied and we had such choice of able seamen who were willing to go in the expedition that we turn'd feveral ashoar after they had embarqu'd as having no occasion for them
as to his reflection on mr robert blackwood for pinching them of their wages and
for cheating them as to their provisions that gentleman is now at london where we leave and him to account for it
we doubt not but mr blackwood may have justice done him in if he thinks sit to sue for it but so much we think our selves oblig'd to say in his vindication during his absence that he was never charg'd with any such thing by the company
his next reflections on the transfer
by which he would impose on the world as if it had been a trick of the company to cheat the seamen of their wages are so much the less to be credited that he himself is a party and commenc'd the suit he talks of in doctors commons which tho that court may perhaps have determin'd in his favour because the bargain was made with him in london and those that made it were on the spot and for other causes best known to themselves it is nothing at all to the matter in hand our courts have no reason to take them for a precedent and our company has as little to allow the libeller any wages
but to come to the transfer which he so foully misrepresents
it was so far from being a clandestine practice that it was agreed on in publick council and but highly reasonable that the colony should be accountable to the company for the stock they intrusted them with
the libeller only betrays his own folly and malice and imposes upon his suborners when he says the gentlemen who gave their joint bond to the company for were not worth so many english pence for admitting they had not been worth one penny of personal estate they were intrusted by the company with cargo and ships provisions to make it up which was not charg'd upon them as their personal debt but upon the colony as a corporation till the same was paid
what he says as to the seamen is a malicious untruth
it was indeed agreed that the colony should pay them but if they did not the company was to do it and besides the two months advance which the libeller owns was paid them the company was to pay to them or to those that had their powers or letters of attorny a month in six and have accordingly paid them
as to the seamens being made believe that assoon as they had set the landmen on shoar they were to proceed on a trading voyage and return to scotland to be paid it is equally false they being to stay out whilst the company pleas'd

then as to the transfer in general it was so far from being clandestine or a trick that the company was impower'd to make it by the act of parliament which gave them their original as any person may see by turning to the act it self

which authorizes them to transfer their joint stock or capital fund or any estate real or personal ships goods belonging to the company under such restrictions rules conditions as the said company shall by writing in and upon their books appoint
as to the landmen whom he will also have to be impos'd upon they knew what they had to relic on and were very well satisfied with it and as to the companys levying souldiers under the notion of planters without asking leave of the privy council admitting it to be true they are not at all to be blam'd for it since they had no reason to think that the faction at court which had contraven'd acts of parliament by opposing their subscriptions and denying them the men of war built for the protection of our trade would allow them to levy souldiers under that name
but the truth of the matter is this they were really design'd for planters and not at all for military business tho it was highly necessary the colony should have as many officers and disciplin'd men as they could that they might be the more able to defend themselves in case of attaque and therefore his railing against the colony for offering to punish deserters and other criminals pag
only discovers his own ignorance and malice for by the act of parliament they had the whole power civil and military conferr'd upon them and accordingly might exercise their power upon all persons belonging to the company as they saw cause so that this is again a libelling of the act of parliament thro the company's sides

his representation of the seven men chosen for counsellors page
is false and malicious to the highest degree
the liberty given to add other

six to those seven was not as he spitefully insinuates for english or french men of substance that should join them from the plantations but for such of their own number as they might think fit to assume afterwards
it cannot once enter into the thoughts of any man of sense that the colony should at first entrust foreigners and especially french papists in their government or that the company had any design they should do so but he and his suborners think it their interest to make us odious to the english and french by accusing us of a design to drain their colonies
as to mr paterson whom he hath all along abus'd he happens now thro inadvertency to vindicate him from his own calumnies he formerly charg'd him as being partner with smith in cheating the company of and now he tells us that mr paterson was brought to this dilemma either to go aboard the fleet bound for caledonia as a volunteer or to go to prison at edinburgh for debt which had he cheated the company of so much mony as this libeller pretends there had been no occasionfor he might have paid his debts and gone where he would and besides the scribler vindicates the company at the same time from his former charge of their being bewitch'd by paterson golden dreams for had they relied so much upon him as the libeller alledges they would never have shew'd that indifference for him which here he ridicules him with
such has been the hard fate of the suborners that their tool has not the sense to make his evidence consistent but every where cuts his own throat by
to sum up the matter according to the libeller's own evidence
in the council there were some men of quality that had been bred to the sword and the law others had been officers both by sea and land and some that had gain'd experience in merchandizing and several trades
his banter on the death of the ministers and blasphemous abuse of scripture
smell so rank of the atheist and libertine and do so evidently prove that he hath lost all sense of humanity and religion that we are sarissied it will do his masters and their cause more hurt than service and therefore we pass it over

the next proof we have of his falshood and malice is his long story about mr wafer from page to wherein he does so blend truth with falshood as shews he had a mind at any rate to bespatter the reputation of the committee of the company the said commitree knew nothing of those gentlemers treating with wafer at london till they acquainted them with it and it was only upon their recommendation that they sent for him as to their collecting any guineas at pontack's for mr wafer it is altogether false
the articles were drawn by mr james campbel the merchant now in london and wrote by mr fitz gerald an irish merchant who both can restify that this matter is foully misrepresented for mr wafer had an alternative propos'd to him which he agreed to viz to have so much if the company thought sit to imploy him and so much for his trouble and pains if they did not the company was so far from standing in any need of his book that they had a manuscript of it before ever they saw him which was altogether unknown to the gentlemen that treated with him at london this he himself knows to be true and that to his no small surprize they repeared several passages out of it to him and indeed the manuscript is more particular than his book whatever cause he hath since had to make any alterations in it we know not
the company upon the whole finding that he could inform them of no thing considerable more than what was in the manuscript and that he could do them no great service left him at his liberty to publish his book when he pleas'd gave him about first and last for his pains and expence with which he was very well

satisfied and hath declared several times since that the company dealt very honourably with him tho mr took a great deal of pains to make him publish a memoire to the contrary which by his honest friend mr fitz gerald advice he desisted from doing
as to the libeller's malicious insinuation that they had no further service for him when once he had discovered the place where the grew it is absolutely false for the manuscript they had was very particular in that
this mr wafer knows to be true and if he have but a just resentment he is equally concern'd to vindicate himself for the libeller reflects as much upon him as upon the company when he charges him with putting a cheat upon them as to their
which says he and others went in search of for several miles along the coast but could find none and yet he magnifies wafer freedom and being ingenious by informing them so particularly as to the place where the grew
so perpetually does this malicious libeller contradict to the other parts of his story of mr wafers being conceal'd near haddington and afterwards at edinburgh it was no more than what prudence would have directed any men to do in the like circumstances the company not knowing till after having discours'd him whether he could do them any service or not it was not their wisdom to expose him to publick view and having found that he could not serve them it was equally prudent in them to keep him at an uncertainty as to their design they being under no obligation to acquaint him with it
as to the story of admiral bembo waiting their motion if they did say so the event hath made it but too probable he hath waited so long in those parts till our colony hath left darien what orders he had concerning it or what part he hath acted in it time must determine but if all that we have heard of large bills being return'd him and of his offers by his sloops to draw our men from our colony be true there's reason to suspect that he was sent thither with no design for our advantage however that may be we know not but this we know that if our enemies at court had been as zealous to protect us as they have been to ruin us the admiral would certainly have had orders to have made reprisals on the spaniards for detaining

capt pincarton his ship and men contrary to treary with the king of great britain when forc'd by a storm under the walls of carthagena

he tells us that two thirds of the provision were spent e're the fleet sail'd that there was none to be had in scotland at that time and if there had there was no money the being sunk and the company's credit not worth and that they had stuck there had it not been for some few pillars of the scots company who mortgag'd their estates for which the company made over three of their ships to them for their security
that there was no provisions to be had then in scotland will seadily be allow'd him is sufficient to answer all his malicious clamour against the company and to confute his own objection
in defence of his masters against the company for not sending them provisions
that there was no money and that the company's credit was not worth is confuted by himself when he owns that a few of the pillats rais'd and took three of the company's ships for security
for that a few of the pillars could raise and the company have three new ships one of them of guns to give for security and yet the company's credit not to be worth is a palpable contradiction
that any of the company mortgaged their estates to raise money is false they advanc'd it on their own credit as they might well do it being well known there are several of them who have as much yearly estate as the sum he speaks of nor did they desire the company's ships in security but only a bond which it was reasonable they should have

he comes next to give us an account of the shortness of the provisions
and of his own honesty in the mean time in not acquainting the commadore with it till they were three days at sea perhaps he had embezel'd them himself or pocketed some of the money for he owns that he had some time before been concerned in the victualling part and therefore dar'd not to say any thing of it on shore lest it might have been prov'd upon him but however that is this we are sure of that the company had letters from their ships at the maderas that

they had twelve months provisions of all sorts at sharp allowance and that if any thing fell short it was likely to be their bread that they thought this to be true may be reasonably concluded from his own
narrative where he says the council upon his representation design'd to send an express from the orkneys to acquaint the company with the shortness of their provisions which to be sure they would have done had they been sensible that they were so short as he alledges besides he owns they had full eleven months allowance of at four days in the week when do it is probable that they had other things in proportion
the reason why they had no more beer but ten tun was that the seamen could not depend on the beer because it spoils they had great store of very good water and a very great quantity of brandy which the libeller takes no notice of
as for the company's promising them credit at the maderas it is false nor was there any need of it they had pipe staves and other goods which were thought proper for the maderas but if it did not answer so well as twas expected twas but the common misfortune of merchants who many times meet with such disappointments
nor is it to be expected that a nation of so little experience in trade as ours should at first setting out be free from mistakes or mismanagement especially since we have such invective enemics to deal with who make it their business to get ill men amongst us every where on purpose to break our design

his next reflection is on the small allowance of ready money which is sufficiently answer'd when we tell him their cargo was reckon'd instead of it and as has been already said must needs be conceiv'd to be very proper for a country where people go naked for want of apparel
they had an great deal of butter and excellent beef of scots breed by which we gain'd an experiment contrary to the common notion for upon trial it was found to be better than the irish and therefore our men tesolv'd to keep it last
his objection as to its having been eighteen months in salt is frivolous
scamen think nothing of that when they can carry beef to the east indies and back again and keep it good all the while
his change upon drummelier as having bought damnified
wheat for their

bread and put the money in his poket is malicious and false there's no man but one of the renegadoes temper that can suspect that worthy gentleman to be capable of any such thing
besides the bread was extraordinary good
his story
about is false the company gave no positive orders to leave any men there and its equally false that the danes prevented our taking possession of it our men were there before the danes came from st thomas the governour of which suspecting our design upon the arrival of the unicorn there sent an officer and fifteen men to assert the king of danmark right after our men went off from the place they saw the danish sloop in another bay of the same island call'd bay and a tent ashore with danish colours on it upon which captain pennicook landed again told them we were possessed before them against which they offer'd their protest to please the court of denmark but wish'd with all their hearts we might settle there for we should be a good bulwark to them against the spaniards of who are very troublesome neighbours

it is false what he says
that captain andreas after looking upon us at first
landing did not come near us in three or four weeks for he came aboard us at first with some of his men on the of november and brought his travelling wife with him on the of november when he came on board again and was very well satisfied with us and on the of the same month he and his son wife and sister din'd on board us
and on the of november he was invited on board handsomly
treated and after having given a rational vindication of himself as to the matter suggested against him by the other danien captains or princes and being inform'd of our real design which before he suspected to be piracy he desir'd a commission from us which was readily granted and cheerfully accepted and he solemnly promis'd to defend us to the last drop of his blood
that his commission was left behind him in the locker of the cram'd in amongst empty bottles we have nothing but this renegado's word for it but admitting it to be so it does not therefore necessarily follow that it was left there by andreas or his order it is not to be suppos'd that a

person of his note could creep into the undiscover'd and perhaps it may be no unreasonable conjecture to think that it was stole from him and lodg'd there by this renegado for he owns that it was himself that found it and he knows the proverb he that hides knows best where to find
his story about andreas exit
that he fell or was thrown down the main of the caledonia in the night time after a quarrel with ambrosio the greatest of those indian captains has such an air of malice and falshood that it requires better evidence than that of a libeller before it can obtain belief with any rational man or allowing it to be true that he was actually tumbled down the in the night time it looks more like the practice of such a quarrelsome ill natur'd person as himself than of any body else
they that know his behaviour to his own captain when he was surgeon on board one of the king's ships his quarrelling with captain pennicook commadore of our ships that went to darien and the whole tenor of his conversation cannot think this any uncharitable reflection
his unnatutal rancor against his native country and unbounded malice against the scots company make it probable enough that he might do such a thing on purpose to render the natives enemies to the colony which he deserted himself about a month after and this is so much the more probable because he exclaims against those on board for not taking care of andreas nor letting him blood after his fall since none was so proper to do it as himself who was a surgeon and on board the ship at the time
it is needless to insist any further on his train of falshoods and inconsistencies in his account of the country which being contrary not only to all that have wrote of it but also to the journals and letters sent from our colony
we have better reason to say that his description is calculated to the humour of our enemies and his suborners than that the colony's and mr wafer accounts were calculated to the meridian of the scots company
to put this matter out of all doubt we shall here subjoin the first letter sent from caledonia by the council of the colony to the company which is the testimony of six against one

right honourable

our last to you was from the maderas of the of aug and sent by the several ways of holland and pottugal to the contents whereof we now refer and in particular to the state of provisions therewith sent and which we now find doth considerably fall short even of what was then computed by reason of the badness of the cask
the account of the remaining part of our voyage together with the most material transactions since you may know by the enclosed journal or diary of our proceedings
we now send you our letters and dispatches by mr alexander hamilton merchant who takes the opportunity of passing to you by the way of jamaica over england to whom we desire you would order forty shillings sterling to be paid weekly towards his expences during the time he shall stay with you negotiating our affairs
the wealth fruitfulness health and good situation of the country proves for the better much above our greatest expectation which god almighty seems to have wonderfully reserv'd for this occasion and now to have prepar'd our way and disposed the indies to that purpose
in our passage hither several of our number have been taken from us by death whose names we have herewith sent you and whereof the loss of our two ministers is the most sensible to us
we therefore intreat you would use your utmost endeavours with the general assembly for procuring others so supply that great want as to the country we find it very healthful for although we arriv'd here in the rainy season from which we had little or no shelter for several weeks together and many sick among us yet they are so far recover'd and in so good a state of health as could hardly any where be expected among such a number of men together nor know we any thing here of those several dangerous and mortal distempers so prevalent in the english and other american islands
in fruitfulness this country seems not to give place to any in the world for we have seen several of the fruits as whereof chocolate is made bonellos maize oranges plantains mangoe yams and several others all of them of the best of their kind any where found
nay there is hardly a spot of ground here but what may be cultivated for even upon the very tops and sides of the hills and mountains there is commonly three or four foot deep of rich

earth without so much as a stone to be found therein
here is good hunting and fowling and excellent fishing in the bays and creeks of the coast so that could we improve the season of the year just now begun we should soon be able to subsist of our selves but fortifying and building will lose us a whole years planting
by the want of sloops or finall coasting vessels we have hitherto had no opportunity of disposing any part of the cargo or doing other needful things
since the loss of the french ship mentioned in the journal we understand that the captain had an underband correspondence in tampering with some of the natives whom be intended to carry away with him which hightens our jealousy that the french have a design upon this place or at least to make a settlement hereabout
and we heartily wish that our most gracious king were truly informed of what consequence it will be both to his greatness and security to countenance and encourage us his loyal and dutiful subjects here that our prince and country be not only depriv'd of so valuable a jewel but least the same should fall a prey to some of our rival neighbours
this will be the companies part to notice after these dispatches shall come to hand you have inclosed a list of several goods and merchandises vendable and proper for this place our situation being incomparable for the trade of the coast where besides our inland trade there is commonly but or or at most but or days sail to the best places of trade upon the coast and to the outmost considerable islands adjoining
and we desire that particular merchants in scotland and elsewhere may be incouraged to trade and correspond hither in which we hope they will sufficiently find their account
we have also sent you a state of what supplies of provisions stores and merchant goods are absolutely necessary for the present support of the colony referring it to the company to determine what reasonable consideration they will have for the sums that shall be advanced for that purpose and we entreat that all possible expedition may be us'd in sending us these needful supplies for without that we shall not only be incapable of making you suteable returns but this hopeful undertaking together with our seives will run no small risque of being inevitably lost
but however it be by the help of god we shall not fail to do our unmost in making speedy and suteable returns

and shall always account it our greatest honour to expose our persons and all that's most near and dear unto us in promoting this hopeful design as not only promising profit and glory to the company and all who are concern'd with them but as being the likeliest means that ever yet presented towards the inabling our countrymen to revive recover transmit to posterity the virtue lustre and wonted glory of their renown'd ancestors and to lay a foundation of wealth security and greatness to our mother kingdom for the present and succeeding ages
in which we can no way doubt of your most hearty concurrence and utmost support
so praying almighty god would bless and prosper the company in all their undertaksngs
we remain

caledonia new edenburgh december
postscript starts here
we intreat you to send us a good ingineer who is extreamly wanted here
this place being capable of being strongly fortified
you'l understand by our from maderas the danger as well as the tediousness of our passage north about so that if the ships can conveniently be fitted out from clyd it will save a great deal of time in their passage and be far less bazardous
this being from men who knew the misrepresentation of the affair must needs issue in their own ruin cannot be suspected of disingenuity and therefore must certainly the evidence of a renegado who owns that he writes out of malice

the first defence he puts in the company's mouthis their being baulk'd of foreign subscriptions which made them lose time and money whereby they could not send out such a number of men and quantity of provisions as the project would have required
this is litterally true let and his suborniers answer it if they can
as for his question why did they prodigally throw away in holland and hamburgh purely to make a bluster

there and why did they trust to another man's purse till such time as they are sure of it we shall answer by asking him another question viz
since he pretends to know the secrets of the west end of the town why did our government oppose our taking foreign subscriptions since they had impowered us by acts of parliament and letters pattent to take them and since twas such a thing as the like perhaps was never done what reason had we to suspect being baulk'd of our foreign subscriptions he himself own'd that the hollanders and hamburgers were fond of our project till our government oppos'd us and therefore by his own confession they are to blame for those disappointments
as to our taking subscriptions in hamburgh and holland
we had reason to engage as many of our protestant neighbours in the design as we could that we might be the more able to defend our selves in case of opposition which is neither ill policy nor inconsistent with honesty

the defence he puts in their mouth that their ships were man'd no provisions to be had in scotland more were providing abroad and no more money to be had from the subscribers till once the ships were sail'd is such as he and his suborners will never be able to answer what could the company do more than take care to have provisions abroad when none were to be had at home and if the subscribers would pay no more money till the ships put to sea there was a necessity of sailing
his objection as to the shortness of their provisions we have answer'd already and shall add which he maliciously conceals that we sent a ship with provisions after them which was cast away in january for which we cannot be answerable and he himself owns we sent another convoy in may then since the colony sent us advice from the maderas dated aug
that they had still months large and twelve months short allowance the company cannot justly be accus'd of supine neglect when they sent away one ship with provisions four months after this notice and two more in five months after that considering that they had no provisions in scotland as the libeller himself owns and that the colony had a cargo which might have bought them provisions either from the natives if they had any to spare which we could not doubt of by mr wafer description or from the english colonies had it not not been for the proclamation which

we had no reason to suspect would be issued at all and much less in such a manner in the name of our own prince who was oblig'd to protect us
to the causes he assigns for the sailing of our fleer without a greater quantity of provisions we add one more viz
that we had reason to fear that our enemies might prevent us which captain long being on those coasts a month before us shews was not without ground no more than our suspicion that endeayours were used to surprize us into a war with the spaniards by long men killing seven of them as hath been already mention'd and of his doing all he could to make us odious to the natives by telling them we were pirates and disobliging both ambrosio and diego by sordid little actions of his own as captain pennicook gave us an accoun in his journal
a grave member of the committee of trade can give a more full account of this if he pleases and when his hand is in he would do well to assign us a reason why that barbarous murder committed by long men was never yet taken notice of by the spaniards since they have published such angry memorials against us who committed no hostilities upon them
his objection to the third and fourth reason relating to the honesty of our design and the cargoes not being proper we have answer'd already
as for that of our goods being seizable in jamaica and other english plantations by the act of navigation it's one of the hardships we justly complain of that was put upon us by the enemics of our nation in charles ii's reign
but allowing it to be reasonable it cannot have so much equity in it as the laws which make it punishable by death to roband murder
yet the execution of those are many times dispenc'd with in favour of criminals by his majesty and indeed a power to dispence with the execution of law sometimes to save the life of a subject is one of the most innocent branches of the prerogative but we had much more reason to have expected a dispensation in this case to save the lives of so many of his subjects who had generously venter'd them for himself

his owning
and
that a cargo of provisions brought by two jamaica sloops was bought by the colony besides as many turtle as came to and odd pounds for which he owns the colony paid em not only

contradicts what he says almost in the same breath that there was neither money no moneys worth to be had in the colony and that they laid out all their stock of ready money for wine at maderas
but may together with their having both provisions and money when they came to new york justly confirm our suspicion that there was a mismanagement of the provisions since two sloop's cargo of provision pipes of wine pounds worth of turtle the fish plantains bonanoes potatoes indian corn sojours or land crabs which he says were plentiful at first added to their former provisions which they own'd they had at the maderas together with the decrease of their number of men by death was not enough to keep their colony from starving for nine months
we have still the more reason to suspect this because the letter from new york which brought us the first certain account of the disaster of our colony hinted as if there might be some work for the hangman
that there were more ill men in the colony than is probable enough and particularly that pennicook was brib'd to raise divisions in the colony and put all in disorder by his insolence which falling in with the proclamations that were concerted for our destruction gave a handle to other ill men to foment the divisions and compleat the ruin of the colony by a total desertion

his insinuation that two jamaica sloops with provisions return'd from the colony without breaking bulk because there was neither money nor market goods there deserves better evidence than his own before it obtain credit
we have indeed heard of one vessel with provisions which insisted on such extravagant rates that the colony would not incourage them to do the like in time to come and therefore would not deal with them hoping that their own convoy might speedily come up but this was before they knew any thing of the ploclamation which cut off all their future hopes ev'n from scotland
we have also letters from new york that the government of that place seem'd to intend them no good of which their desiring our ships to come and anchor under the guns of the castle is a clear proof and the reason of this unkind treatment is also explain'd to us viz
that they suspected our men had a design to return back as soon as they got provisions
nay we

have had advice that their gold dust was actually resus'd at jamaica because of the proclamations which we have reason enough to believe since we cannot think that the it habitants there would be willing to incurr the height of his majesty's displeasure to oblige the scots
that our men had gold dust from the natives for powder shot and speckled shifts the libeller owns himself
and there he brags of it that he brought off more himself at per ounce how he came by it is worth the inquiry than most of the councellors that are come home since and by letters from new york we have heard there was money amongst them by all which tis evident that want of money or goods was not the sole cause of their being demed provisions from the english plantations
his insinuation that the french and dutch islands would have supplied us if we had had money or goods is ridiculous when the government of both those nations had so expresly declared themselves against us

his all gation in that same page that his majesty knew nothing of the colonies settlement at darien but what he had at second hand till the spanith ambassadur told him from his master is so notoriously false that none but a person of his forehead could have advanced it when the world knows that the proclamation against us was publish'd in the in april and the spanish memorial was not deliver'd till may following
we should indeed be very glad to find that his majesty knew nothing of those proclamations and that his name was made use of without his consent as some say his grandfathers was in the irish massacre for then we might reasonably expect speedy justice upon those bold offenders who dar'd to publish such proclamations in his majesty's name wherein we are condemned as having invaded the spanish dmaniens before ever it was heard what we could say for our selves or without giving us any notice of those proclamations that we might have taken care to have preserv'd our men from being starv'd to death by them by which they have made our prince to act more like our declared enemy than one that we had constantly lov'd and rever'd as father of his country and that which is yet more cutting they still prevail to mislead him so as he continues his unnatural opposition to us for besides the proclamations formerly mentioned another has been since

publish'd against us in barbadoes dated sept which is so much the more unaccountable considering the memorial given in by our president and advocate justifying our pretensions which the spaniards have never yet offered to answer
by means of this proclamation the st andrew was denied relief when she fell in with admirel bembo who told her tho they should all starve he could allow them none and the like answer they had from the governor of jamaica tho they offer'd goods in exchange the like opposition is also continued against us at home for tho the company have address'd his majesty yet'tis without effect
after a full representation of their losses they did wisely and dutifully desire the parliament might meet that being the proporest way to have the sinking honour of the company supported but his majesty instead of granting their reasonable desires was prevail'd upon by those who are enemies to our country to prorogue it further at the very time when they knew the address was coming up and all the answer thought sit to give them is that his majesty is sorry for the loss of his ancient kingdom and of the company that they shall have the same liberty to trade to the as formerly and that he will call the parliament when he thinks the good of the nation requires it or to that effect
it may easily be judged that this answer could be no way satisfactory to the company in such a juncture nor are we to wonder if instead of cheering their spirits it struck them dumb and fill'd them with amazement
we wish that those who advise his majesty to such a conduct towards the people of scotland who have never been backward in testifying their loyalty and affection to his person and government would consider that this is a downright violation of our constitution
it's certain that none are so proper to give his majesty advice when a parliament is necessary as our own nobility gentry and burrowghs who are most of them concern'd in our company and therefore their address ought to haye been more regarded than the advice of any particular persons
this false method of government hath ruin'd many of our princes and we wish that those who put his majesty upon such measures may not have his ruin in prospect
it is certain they can be none of his friends who put him upon disobliging of the whole kingdom of scotland in this manner

we come next to the libeller's defence of the spanish

title to darien
his first argument that the spaniards title to that country was never hitherto disputed by any prince or state is a downright falshood
the darien princes themselves controverted it always and their plea was allow'd to be good by the judges of england as we have been fore'd to tell this renegado and his suborners again and again
the title of the spaniards as conquerours to any part of america is not only doubted by the bishop of cheapo don bartholomew de los casas mention'd in the defence of the scots settlement but strenuously argu'd against and maitain'd to be unlawful in his propositions concerning the title of the king of spain to america propos'd to the consideration of the king of spain himself
in his ninth proposition he asserts that when christian princes apply their endeavours to propagate the faith they ought to have no consideration for any thing but the service of if they can do any thing for the advantage of their dominions while they augment the kingdom of christ it ought to be without any considerable prejudice to the infidels or the princes that govern
he asserts they have their own lawful kings and princes who have a right to to make laws for the good government of their respective dominions so that they cannot beexpell'd out of em or depriv'd of what they possess without doing violence to the laws of god as well as the law of nations
prop
seeing the spaniards have not been supported either by the authority of their prince or any lawful reason to make war against the indians who liv'd peaceably in their own country and had done the spaniard no wrong all such conquests that have been or may hereafter be made in the indies are to be accounted unjust tyranical and null being condemned by all the laws of god and men
its true he supposes the of spain to have a title to the soveraignty of the indies by the popes grant but it is with such restrictions as those he mentions and in his proposition says the pope has power to revoke it if it be found prejudicial to the establishment of the faith and he expresly declares throughout his book that all the methods taken by the spaniards were such so that here's one strong evidence of their own against dominicus de soto the of spain confessor at the time scems by his summing up the dispute betwixt this bishop and

dr sepulveda to have been of the same opinion and sepulveda books maintaining the contrary were snppress'd by the emperor charles of the same opinion and indeed more express against the methods by which the spaniards acquir'd their dominions in the indies is franciscus a victoria chief professor of divinity in the university of salamanca whom the emperor charles consulted in cases of conscience and in this amongst others as may be seen in his relectiones theologicae relectione
de indis where he argues the point at large and in relect

de jure bell lays down this as a maxim that an injury receiv'd is the only just cause of making war
so that it being plain from matter of fact that the indians did no manner of injury to the spaniards their war upon them must of necessity by this argumnt be unlawful
more has been said already in vindication of our tide in the defence of the scots settlement than the renegado and his suborners can answer therefore we shall wind up this matter in a few words more
his alledging we might as well land in jamaica where the wild negroes have deserted their masters or in tobago serve only to discover his own folly
there's no unconquer'd natives who have their own princes to govern them in either of those islands nor are the titles of the english and of curland to those places question'd
the irish having admitted french troops into their kingdom is as little to the purpose since they have had no shadow of government or sovereignty left them for several ages have from time to time submitted to the government of england and admitted those troops in defence of the late james title which he derives from hen ii that conqner'd them
besides the libeller himsselt owns
that the natives themselves were pleas'd with the hopes of being restor'd by us to their ancient liberty and greatness and
that ambrosio one of their greatest captains was at war with the spaniards before our arrival
his alleaging that cap
andreas was a spanish captain at the time of our landing needs better proof than his affertion that he might be then at peace with the spaniards and have some respect for them because of his being bred among them as he was
all that they then gave him a commission as a captain does not at all argue that he was in the spanish interest when we landed or any way subject to the crown of spain if he himself promised subjection it does not divest his subjects of their right and that andreas successlor and they were no friends to the spaniards is evident from the libeller's own story that they gave cur colony motice of the spanish party that came to view them and led them to the place where they were we have likwise the testimony of all that have writ of this place against the renegado besides that of the journals of our own colony which give an account that an brosio had engag'd all his neighbouring princes in a league against the spaniard before our arrival

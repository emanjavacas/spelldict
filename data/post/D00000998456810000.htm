breefe and true reporte, of the Execution of certaine Traytours at Tiborne, the xxviii. and xxx. dayes of Maye.
The names of them executed on Monday, the xxviii. of Maye.
The names of them executed on Wednesday, the xxx. of Maye.
Imprinted at London for William VVright, and are to be solde at his shop, adioyning vnto S. Mildreds Church in the Poultrie, the middle shop in the rowe.
To the godly and woorshipfull, Maister Richard Martin, Sherife, and one of the woorshipfull Aldermen of this Cittie of London.
A. M. wisheth all earthlie happines and after this life a place among the chosen in the celestiall Paradise.
WHen had gathered together (woorshipfull Sir) this little pamphlet, reporting the end of certaine lewde and disloyall Traitors, who vnder the habite of hurtlesse Sheepe, sought in the church of God, to playe the part of rauening Woolues: and that my selfe hauing spent some time in Roome and other places, among them, where through grew into such acquaintaunce with their traiterous intents and dispositions, as before some of their faces stoode as witnesse against them, to their reproofe.
thought good to present the same to your woorship; for that your selfe hath beene an eye witnesse, how was there challenged, and how through the grace of God, and the trueth of so good a cause as delt in, defended my self To auoyde therfore the speeches of people, who now a dayes will iudge lightly, and condemne quickly, because was there called foorth, somewhat in woords touched, and yet thanke God nothing disprooued: esteemed it a pointe of wisdome, to laye their obstinate endes open to the view of all, not sparing my selfe in the woords that were vsed against me, which will cause the godly and vertuous to account them as they were, and me as am.
This breefely compacted together, present to your woorships perusing, as my defence against slaunderous tongues, in that haue reported nothing therein, but the meere truthe.
Thus desiring God to blesse your woorship with all yours: in all humilitie remaine.
The Execution at Tiborne, on Monday being the twenty and eyght of May.
ON Munday, being the twentye and eight of May, Thomas Forde, Iohn Sherte, and Robart Iohnsonne Priestes, hauing béene before indited, araigned, and as wel by theyr owne testimonie, as also sufficient witnesses produced to theyr faces, found guilty, and co~demned for high treason: intended, practised, and appointed, against her Maiesties moste royall person, as also for the vtter ruine, ouerthrowe and subuersion, of her peaceable and well gouerned Realme, themselues being sent as instrumentes, to deale for and in the behalfe of the Pope, in this disloyall and trayterous cause.
According as Iustice had before determined were drawen vpon Hurdels from the Tower of London, to the place appointed for Execution.
(Hsuing béen so long time spared by her Maiesties moste royall and princely regarde of mercy: to try if eyther the feare of God, woulde take place in them, consideration and respecte of theyr owne duties mooue them, or the meere looue, and accustomed clemencie of her Maiestie might winne them, to acknowledge her to be theyr lawfull Soueraigne, and them selues her Subiectes bounde to serue her, notwithstanding, any pretence or authority to the contrary,) and not fo
All this notwithstandinge, they remained giuen ouer to theyr owne wickednes, and swallowed vp in the gulfe of theyr vndutifull affection, which causeth Iustice to stop before Mercye, committing them to the rewade of theyre leude and vnnaturall dealing.
All the way as they were drawen, they were accompanied with diuers zealous and godly men, who in mylde and louing speehes, made knowen vnto them, how iustly God repayeth the reprobate, howe fatherly againe, he receiueth the obedient, how he ouerthroweth the vngodlye in their owne deuises, and protecteth his chosen in all stormes and afflictions: in remembrance of all these, to bethinke themselues of their wickednes passed, and to shew such harty and zealous repentaunce for the same, that all be it, they had so greeuously trespassed, yet in contrite and humble sorrowing they might be gratiously receiued into his heauenly fauour, whom they had mooued and styrred by their vnreuerent regarde, to smite and chasten with the rod of his fury.
Among which godly perswasio~s, Maister Sherife himselfe, both learnedly and earnestly laboured vnto them, moouing al good occasions he might deuise, to chaunge the obstinacie be perceiued in the~, into a Christian, like humility and repentaunce, but these good endeuours tooke no wished effect, their owne euil disposition so blinded them, that there was no way for grace to enter.
When they were come beyond S. Giles in ye féeld, there approched vnto the Hurdell, one of their owne secte, and a Priest, as himselfe hath co~fessed, who in this maner spake vnto the prisoners.
gentlemen· be ioyful in the blood of Iesus Christe, for this is the day of your triumpth ioye.
Being asked why he vsed such words, he said vnto the prisoners againe, pronounce a pardon vnto you, yea, pronounce a full remission and pardon vnto your soules.
Using these and other trayterous speeches, holde was layde on him.
When as M. Sherife demaunded what he was? he aunswered, he was the voice of a crier in the wildernesse, and that he was sent to prepare the Lords way.
And notwithstanding such means of resistaunce as himselfe vsed, he was deliuered vnto M. Thomas Norris Pursuuaunte, who brought him vnto Newgate, wher he confessed vnto him that he was a Priest, and that hee had so long dissembled, as he would now leaue off and doo so no moore.
Being come to ye place of Execution, Thomas Forde, was first brought vp into ye Carte, whe~ as he began in this maner.
Wheras am come hither to die, for matters layd vnto my charge of treason, which shoulde be conspired against the Quéene, within these two yeares or somewhat more.
giue you to vnderstande, that of any such matter am innocent and free, for that can prooue my comming into England to be fiue yeerss since.
Where vpon Maister Sherife spake vnto him and sayde, Forde, haue minde on God, aske him and her Maiestie hartily forgiuenesse, who~ thou hast so highly offe~ded, thou doost but delude the people, for it is manifestly known, how thou art guiltye of the matters layde to thy charge, here is thine owne aunswers to shew, affirmed vnder thine owne hand, and other witnesses to reprooue thee.
Where vpon my selfe was called foorth, who iustified the causes to his face, that at hys araignement was layd to his charge, and he euidently and plainly found guiltye thereof.
Then were his aunswers wherto he had subscribed read vnto him, which is in the booke lately sette foorth by authoritye, where vpon he tooke occasion to tell a long sircumstaunce, of a certaine question mooued at Oxenforde, as concerning, taking armes against her Maiestie, which horrible treason he séemed to approoue thereby.
Then Maister Sherife willed him to aske her Maiestie forgiuenes, offering him to stande his freende in attayning her graces mercy, yf he would chaunge his former traiterous minde to become a true and faithfull Subiect, acknowledging her to bee his lawful soueraigne Lady, notwithstanding any thing that any Pope could say or doo to the contrarye.
Whereto be aunswered, haue not offe~ded her Maiestie, but if haue aske her forgiuenes all the world, in no other treaso~ haue offended then my religion, which is ye Catholique faith, wherin will liue and dye.
And as for the Quéenes Maiestie, doo acknowledge her supremacy in all thinges temporal, but as conserning Ecclesiastical causes deny her, that onely belongeth to the Uicar of Christ, the Pope.
In bréefe, he graunted to nothing, but shewed himselfe an impious and obstinate Traytour, and so he remayned to the death, refusing to pray in the English tongue, mum+bling a fewe Latine prayers, desiring those that were Ex domo Dei, to pray with him, and so he ended his lyfe.
In the meane time that he hanged, which was tyll hee was dead, so great is ye mercye of our gratious Princesse.
Iohn Sherte was brought from off the Hurdell to the gallowes, wher séeing Forde hanging.
He bega~ with holding vppe his handes, as the Papistes are wont to doo before theyr Images.
Then being stayed, Forde was cut downe, and caryed to the place where his body should be quartered.
In which time Sherte was brought vp into the Carte, where looking toward the dead bodye of Forde, hee fell downe on his knées, and held vp his hands to it, (saying agayne.)
happy Tom, blessed Tom, thy swéete soule pray for me.
For which woords béeing rebuked, the Executioner lifted him vp on feete, when as he prepared him to his confession, (saying) am brought hither to this place, to dye a death, whych is both shamefull, and ignominious, for which thanks thee my Lord God, who framing me to thine owne simylitude likenes, hath blessed me to thys good ende.
There being stayed, because hee seemed to prolong the time to small purpose, the Sherife willed him to remember hymselfe, for what cause he was come thither: howe he had offended the Quéenes Maiestie, and that he was nowe to aske her forgiuenes, Beside he might receiue her princely mercy: wherto with an Hipocriticall outward boldnesse, but an inward faynting feare, (as afterwarde euerye one playnly beheld,) he gaue thys aunswere.
What Mayster Sherife, shall saue thys frayle and vile carcase, damne mine owne soule? No, no, am a Catholique, in that faith was borne, in that faith will dye, and heere shall my bood seale it.
Then Maister Sherife spake vnto him (saying) by the way as we came, you swore an oath, for which you willed me to beare witnesse y^ you were hartily sorie.
Now pray you let me be a witnesse, that you are as hartelie sorie for offending the Quéenes Maiestie.
Why Sir (quoth he) haue not offended her, without it be in my Religion, and if haue offended her, then aske her forgiuenesse.
Maister Sherife vpon this sayde vnto him: is this the fruites of your Religion, to knéels to the dead bodie of thy fellowe, and to desire his soule to pray for thee.
Alas, what can it eyther profite thée, or hinder thée? praye thou to God and he will helpe thee.
Maister Sherife, (quoth Sherte,) this is the true Catholique Religion, and whosoeuer is not of it, is dampned.
desire his soule to pray for me, the most glorious Uirgin Marie to praye for me, and all the holy company of Heauen to pray for me.
At which woords the people cried, away with the traytor, hang him, hang him.
Maister Sherife) forsake y^ whore of Roome wicked Antichriste, with all his abhominable and and put thy whole Christ: wherto he aunswered.
little reme~ber the day, when as you shall bothe at one bar, come as witnesse against you, that you that holie and blessed Uiccar of Christ, the whoore of Rome, at which words ye people cried again: hang him, hang him, away with him.
Then he began his Pater noster in Latine, and before he had fully ended two petitions of it, he fell into the Latine Creede, and then to the Pater noster againe, afterwarde he sayde the Aue Maria: which done, knocking him selfe on the brest, saying Iesus, esto mihi Iesus, the Carte was drawne away, and he committed to the Mercie of God.
But then to manifest that his former boldnesse, was but méere dissembling, and hipocrisie: he lyfted vp his handes, and caught holde on the Halter, so that euerie one perceyued his fayre outwarde shewe, and his fowle inward disfigured nature, also howe loth he was and vnwilling to die.
Robert Iohnson, being broughte vp into the Carte, Maister Sherife according as he had before, both declared vnto hym, her Maiesties mercy if he would repent, and al so willed him to be sory for his offences against her, wher of he séemed to make small estemation, denying the treasons according as the others had done, and appealinge likewise vpon his religion.
Then was called foorth againe, when as gaue him to vndersta~d, how notably he was approued guilty at his araignement, euery matter sufficiently handled, how according as the reste were, he was confounded to his face, whereto he would make no oher aunswer, but sayd.
The~ were hys aunswers read vnto him, as they had béen before unto the other twain, hee not yeelding deniall, but sayd he spake them, and would doo it againe.
Then was Athanasius Creede mooued vnto hym, which he graunted to be the Catholique fayth, whereof the Pope was Uiccar, and that there was no other Catholique fayth, but onely his.
Why quoth the Preacher, the Pope is not named in it, knowe not that (quoth he againe,) haue not read it.
Then Maister Sherife desired him to say hys prayers in English, and he with all the company woulde pray with him.
Which he refusing to doo, in his Latine prayers, the Carte was drawen away, and he committed to Gods mercye.
The Execution at Tiborne, on VVedensday, being the thirtye of Maye
ON the VVednesday following, which was the thirtye daye of May, in the same maner as haue before expressed.
Luke Kirbie, William Filbie, Thomas Cottom, and Lauraunce Rychardson, were committed from the Tower of London, to the place of Execution, and as the other were on the Mundaye before associated and accompanied with diuers learned and godlye Preachers, euen so were these, as to say, Maister Charke, Maister Herne, and diuers others, who all the waye applyed such godly and Christian perswasions vnto them, (as had not the Child of perdition so meruailouslye blinded them) were of force to haue wonne them into grace Mercye.
The speeches they vsed to them by the way were néedelesse here to set downe, for that they did especiallye concerne causes to roote out that wicked opinion in them, and to establish a sound and perfect fayth in place thereof, but euen as it was in the other, so it did agree in them.
But Luke Kirbie séemed to chalenge me, as concerning was able to approoue nothing against him, which he did because he supposed was not there present: but what passed betwéene, him and me, you shall heare hereafter.
They being come to the place of Execution, William Filbie, was brought vp into the Carte, where conforming himselfe vnto the death, his wicked treasons were mooued vnto him, which obstinately and impudently he denied.
Then was he demaunded if hee would acknowledge the Quéenes Maiestie his soueraigne Princesse, and supreme head vnder Christ of the Churche of Englande.
No (quoth he) will acknowledge no other head of the Church, then the Pope onelie: Wher vyon his aunsweres were reade vnto him, and he not denying them in any point, euén as they were wicked and impious, euen so he remayned in them, still appealing that it was for his Religion that he died, and not for any Treason.
But the contrarie was prooued vnto his face, as well by sufficient proofes, as also by the Trayterous aunswers, whereto hée had subscribed with his owne hande.
At last, as he was desired: he prayed for the Queenes Maiestie, that GOD might blesse her, and incline her harte to mercie towards the Catholiques, of which societie he was one.
Then they opening his bosome, founde there two Crosses, which béeing taken from him, were helde vp, and showen to all the people, beside, his Crowne was shauen.
So after a fewe silent Latine prayers to himselfe, the Carte was drawne away.
The next was Luke Kirbie, who being brought vp into the Carte, offered long circumstaunce of spéeche, as concerning that he was come thither to dye, hoping to bee saued in the blood of Christe: and much matter, which were néedelesse here to rehearse.
Afterwarde, he beganne to saye, that there were none could approoue him to be a tray tour: neither had he at any time attempted any thing preiudiciall to her Maiestie, and that his aduersaries, Sled, nor Munday, could not vpbraide him with any thinge.
Whervpon Maister Sherife tolde him, that Munday was there, and asked him if he woulde haue him called to him.
sée him (quoth he) yonder, and let him say what he can against mee.
Then was commaunded to come some what neere him, when as he began in this manner to mée: Munday consider with thy selfe, howe vntruly thou hast charged mee, with that which neuer sayd nor thought.
Besides, thou knowest that when thou camest to ye Tower to me, before Maister Liuetenaunt, and an other who was there present then, thou wast demau~ded what thou thoughtest of mée, and what thou couldest say against mée? when as thou madest aunswer.
Thou knewest no harme by mee, neither couldest thou at any tyme saye otherwise of mée then well: wherevpon thou wast asked, wherefore thou reportedst otherwise at my arraignement? Then the Sherife sayde vnto him, who can beare thée witnesse of this? (Quoth he againe) he spake it before Maister Lieuetenaunt, and an other was by then.
Then was he demaunded what other he was that was present: which (after a long trifling) he sayde was a Keeper, and named him: whereto made aunswere as followeth.
Maister Kirbie, wishe and desire you, in the feare of God, to remember your selfe, for this is not a place to report an vntrueth, neither to slaunder any man otherwise then you are able to prooue.
When as came vnto the Tower, and made knowen to Maister Lieuetenant, for what cause was sent to speake with you, you were brought into a Chamber by your Keeper: and what mooued vnto you, your selfe very well knoweth, as co~cerning my allowaunce béeing the Popes Scholler: where, what aunswere you made, haue truelie, and according as you aunswered already set downe in print.
Maister Lieuetenant neither mooued any such woordes to mée, as héere you reported, and call GOD to my witnesse, that not a motion of any such matter was once offered to mée by Maister Lieuetenant, or by your Kéeper.
Your selfe then vttered that at sundrie times in the Seminarie, there was diuerse leude woords spoken, which might better haue béene spared and denied that you were not in my Chamber, when as lying sicke in my bed trayterous spéech as were mooued by them, which were then present, whereof your selfe was one, with diuer so other matters which you spake vnto me, which Maister Lieuetenant him selfe heard, and your Kéeper béeing present.
But if this be true which you say, that it may be prooued there was eyther such woordes mooued vnto mée, or any such aunswere made by mée, offer to sustaine what punishment the Lawe shall affoorde mée.
Then falling to an other matter, for that this redounded to his owne confusion, (as Maister Lieuetenant can well witnesse:) he beganne to talke of my being at Roome, what fréendshippe he had shewed vnto mée, and had done the lyke vnto a number of English men, whome he well knew, not to be of that Religion, bothe out of his owne purse, as also be fréending them to some of the Popes Chamber, he made conueyaunce for them thece, some tyme going fortie miles with them: when (quoth he) had my dealings béene knowne, should hardlie haue beene well thought off: and knewe well enough, that you were neuer bent to that Religion, albeit they thought the contrarie.
Yea, knewe well enough, when you departed thence, that your disposition was contrarie to ours, and concealed it to my selfe.
Kirbie (quoth Maister Sherife) this is verie vnlyke, that you could affoord such fauour to any, who were contrarie to that Religion that you professed no, no, if you knewe any such there, you would rather helpe to persecute them, then to pittie them, as it is the nature of you all.
Maister Kirbie (quoth I) it is very vnlike that you had any such secrete knowledge of mée, eyther of my Religion, or howe was secretlie bent, as you séeme heere to professe, for had béene such a one as you woulde perswade these heere, you knewe mée to be, would you haue delyuered mee those silke Pictures halowed by the Pope which you did: and moreouer, make knowne to mée sundry of your freends heere in England, to whome should conuey them· Munday (quoth he) confesse deliuered to thée Pictures in déede, but thou knowest gaue thée two Iulyes to goe huie them with, dyd it because knewe thée to be such a one, and therefore dyd misdoubt thee, for woulde not credite thée with my hallowed Pictures.
Maister Kirbie (quoth I) to deny your owne dooinges, is meruailous impudencie: dyd not you in your Chamber, delyuer to mée certaine silke Pictures, which you tolde mée at Seukelyes béeing there, were hallowed by the Pope, what Indulgences were allowed them: one of them, which was a Crucifixe you gaue me, the other you willed me deliuer to your fréends at Rheimes, and in Englande: and because they were so fewe (as in deede thinke they were no more but fiue) you gaue me two Iulyes, to goe into the Cittie to buie more, which dyd: and hauing brought them to you, three or fowre of the fayrest you tooke from me, promising to gette them hallowed at the next Benediction: the other in deede you gaue me, and tooke them with me.
Howe saye you nowe Kirbie (quoth Maister Sherife) would you haue credited him with such matters, had you not supposed him to be one of your owne secte.
Maister Sherife (quoth he) what haue sayde, knewe verie well.
And after he was gone from Roome, sent fifteene shyllinges to Rheimes, to be delyuered to him, but he was departed thence towarde Englande, before it came.
Then Maister Sherife sayde to him againe, you stand vpon these pointes verie much, which there is none that are héere, but will iudge to be vntrue.
Thou hearest what he hath sayde vnto thee, and we haue heard that thou deniedst euerie thing.
What sayest thou to thy Treasons, wherefore thou arte come eyther to dye wylt thou be sorio for them, aske God and her Maiestie forgiuenesse, for shee is mercifull, and we wyll carrie thée backe againe, if wee shall perceyue in thee any such motion, that thou wylte forsake thy former wickednesse, and become a good and faithfull Subiect.
At these woordes, the people among them selues, almoste generallie sayde: excéeding mercie and fauour, what a gratious Princesse haue wée, who affoordeth such mercie to those that haue so yll deserued.
Then Maister Feeld the Preacher, in the booke read his aunsweres to him, where he had subscribed with his owne hande.
Whether the Pope might lawfullie depose her Maiestie, or had any aucthoritie to take the tytle of her Crowne and dignitie away from her, wherto Kirbie aunswered.
This is a matter disputable in Schooles, and therefore maye not iudge of it.
thinke this with my selfe, that if any Prince fal by infidelity, into Turscisme, Atheisme, Paganisme, or any such lyke, that y^
And beeing asked, if her Maiesty were in any such: he sayd, he knew his owne co~science.
Another Preacher being by, said vnto him, that the Prince receiued his aucthority fro~ God, that he was to be suppressed by none, but only by God Again that Salomon sayd: By me (meaning by God) Kinges raigne, and Princes decree Iustice.
By me Princes rule, and the Nobles all the Iudges of the earth.
Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God, and the powers that be, are ordained of God.
Who soeuer therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinaunce of God, and they that resist, shall receyue to them selues iudgement.
For Princes are not to be feared forgood works, but for euill: wilt thou then be without feare of the power, doo well, so shalt thou purchase praise of the same: For he is the minister of God for thy wealth: But if thou doo euill, feare, for he beareth not a swoord for naught, for he is the minister of God to take vengeaunce on him that dooth euill.
If then the Pope be a Soule, hee is to be obedient to the higher powers.
And béeing a subiect to God, as all other Princes be: hée must not take vpon him, what belongeth to God.
As for the aucthoritie that her Maiestie hath, shee hath receyued it from God, neither is the Pope, or any earthlie Prince to depriue her therof, but onelie God.
Againe, when Iesus was brought before Pilate, Pilate sayde to him.
Knowest thou not that haue power to crucifie thée, and haue power to loose thee? To the which Iesus aunswered: Thou couldest haue no power at all against mee, except it were giuen thee from aboue.
Thus maye you see, that what Prince so euer ruleth vpon earth, hath his power and aucthority only from God: and not that any mortall man can vse the aucthoritie of a Prince at his pleasure.
How say you to this? whereto he would make no aunswere: But séemed to demaunde of them, if they would deny, that if a Prince were in Paganisme, Atheisme, or gouerned by infidelitie: that such a Prince might not lawfullie be deposed.
Which the learned Preachers aunswered in learned sort, approouing that as the power was of God, so Princes were not to be deposed by any, but onelie by God.
No (quoth Kirbie againe) hath it not béene disputed in Schooles for these fiue hundred yéeres, and will you deny it? Maister Crowley, Maister Crowley, and there pawsed, as though that Maister Crowley had agréede with him in such a monstrous error.
But Maister Crowley him selfe gaue me to vnderstand, that at such time as hee conferred with the sayde Kirbie in the Tower, about the same argument, that his aunswer was vnto him.
If any Prince fell into any such kinde of error, that Prince were corrigible, but of whom? not of any earthly Prince, but of that heauenlie Prince, who gaue him his aucthority, and seeing him abuse it any way, correcteth him in his Iustice.
For by his attributing to the Pope, this aucthority, he witnessed him to be Antichrist in y^ he wil depose Princes at his pleasure, exalt him self aboue all that is called God, and forgiue men their sinnes at his pleasure likewise.
All this was not sufficie~t to mollifie y^ obstinate minde of Kirbie, but he would persist styl in this deuillsh imaginatio~.
Maister Sherife the Preachers, seeing him wauering, not able to yéeld any reason for his arrogant opinion, laboured as much as in them laye to chaunge it: and when all would not serue, they desired him in hartie and humble manner to pray to God, to ashe her Maiestie forgiuenesse, for the Treasons wherein he had offended her.
Whereto he aunswered, that he had not offended in any Treason, to his knowledge: whervpon they shewed him his Treasons, which were adiudged by the people, woorthy of greater punishment, then he was at that time to suffer, yet would not he acknowledge them.
But prayed to God for her Maiestie, that shée might lo~g rule in her aucthoritie, to confound all her enimies: and that his hart was frée from any Treason to her Maiestie.
Then preparing himself to his prayers, the Preachers desired him to pray in Englishe with them, and to say a prayer after them, wherin, if he could finde any fault, he should be resolued thereof.
(quoth he againe) you and I, were not one in faith, therefore thinke, should offend God, if should praye with you: At which woordes, the people began to crie, away with him: so be saying his Pater noster in Latin, ended his life.
Then was Laurence Richardson brought vp into the Carte, and to him Thomas Cottom, to be executed togeather.
But Cottom seemed to vtter such words, as though there had béene hope he would haue forsaken his wickednesse, so that the halter was vntyed, he brought downe out of ye Carte againe: In which time Laurence Richardson prepared him to death, confessing him selfe a Cathelique, and that he would beléeue in all things, as the Catholique Church of Roome did, vnto ye Pope he allowed the onelie Supremacie.
In which traiterous opinion, after certaine Latin prayers, he was committed to God.
Then was Cottom brought vp to the Carte againe, and the good opinion had of him before, chau~ged into that obstinate nature, that was in them all, saying to Maister Sherife, that before he came into Englande, he was armed for India, and thyther if he might be suffered, he would passe with as much co~uenient spéede as might be.
Then looking to the body of Laurence Richardson, wheron the Executioner was vsing his office, he lysted vp his handes and sayde: blessed Laurence, pray for mée, thy blessed soule Laurence, pray for mée: for which woordes, both the Preachers the people rebuked him telling him that he ought to pray to none, but to God onely, all helpe of man was but in vaine.
Wherto he aunswered, he was assured that he could pray for him.
In bréefe, his Treasons béeing mooued to him, he denied all, albeit his owne hand writing was there to affirme it.
He prayed for her Maiestie, and sayde his Pater noster, and Aue Maria: and as the Carte was drawing away, he sayd: In manus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum, and so he ended his lyfe.
Thus in bréefe haue set downe the Execution of these Traytors, desiring God, that the leude life of them and this lamentable spectacle wytnessed to our eyes, may be a warning to vs all, how by our disobedience we prouoke our Lord God to anger against vs, and by our slacknesse in duetie, to our gratious soueraigne Princesse, next vnder God, our only supreame gouernesse, enforce her mercifull hand to take vp the swoord of Iustice against vs. God long preserue her Maiestie, and her honourable Counsayle: confound Antichriste and his practises, and giue all faithfull Subiectes, the grace to beare true and loyall mindes, to God, their Prince and Countrey.
Let this suffise thée (gentle Reader) at this time: and if thou desirest to be more acquainted with their Romish and Sathanicall inglinges, reade my English Romaine lyfe, which so soone as it can be printed, shall be set foorth.
And thus committing thée to the God of all trueth, who giue vs the grace to cleaue to the Trueth: byd thée hartelie farewell.

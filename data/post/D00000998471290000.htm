The preface of Alexander Barclay preest vnto the right hye and mighty prince: Thomas duke of Northfolke.
[Figure: RIght myghty hye magnificent prince: myne humble seruyce due vnto your grace.
And the veheme~t affection whiche haue vnto your honour perpetual fame impelleth me often tymes to deuyse and reuolue in mynde: what seruice or pleasur my simplenesse might do co~uenient and acceptable vnto your hyghnesse: therby to testify the honour the loue obsequy: whiche knowlege my selfe to owe vnto your magnifice~ce.
But whan co~syder and compare my symplenesse and impotence with your preemine~t dignite: fynde myselfe gretly insufficie~t to parforme or attempt any besynesse or warke which may condynglie present vnto your honorable prese~ce.
Neuertheles after many co~syderacio~s: the gracious regarde of benynge grauite which beholde in your cou~tenance: and the euident signes of humilite whiche outwardly apereth in your noble hert: reconforteth myne insufficience inboldeth my spirites some thyng to write my custome whiche may present into your gracious handes: as a perpetual memo+rial: an and euident testimony of my deuout seruice amorous affection against your ma+gnificent hyghnes.
In this consyderacion haue reuolued many diuerse volumes studyeng of which one: the tra~slacion: might cor+respond with your noble estat.
But at last haue reme~bred that a mercyal matter is most co~gruent vnto a marcial victorious prince.
Wherfore haue attempted to translate into our maternal langage the auncient cronicle famous hystorie of the warre: and dyuers batayls which the romayns dyd agaynst the tyran Iugurth: vsurper of the kyngdome of Numidy.
Whiche hystorie is writen in latyn by the ronowmed romayne Salust: whose wordes in latyn haue also added vnto the marge of this my tra~slacion to thintent that such as shal dysdayne to rede my translation in englysshe: may rede this hystorie more co~pendyously more obscurely writen in laten.
Which hystorie: parauenture shal apere more clere playne vnto theym in many places by help of this my tra~slation.
Which shal nat be tedyous to such as be lerned vndestande latyn: but vnto many noble gentylmen whiche vnderstande nat latyn tong {per}fetly dout nat but that this my labour shalbe both pleasure profet.
For by the same they shal haue some help toward the vndersta~dyng of latyn: whiche at this tyme is almost conte~ned of gentylmen.
And also they shal vnderstande a ryght fruytful hystorie: bothe pleasant profitable ryght necessary vnto euery degre: but specially to gentylmen whiche coueyt to attayne to clere fame and honour: by glorious dedes of chyualry.
But dout nat: but that some calumnyous detractours shal maligne agaynst this my besynes and {pro}fitable labour sayeng that to a preest and man {pro}fessed to obserua~ce of religion: it is farre co~trary dysagreynge to intermyt hymselfe with warfare: or to intermyt with thyng{is} of batayle: outher by dedes counsel or writynge.
But to stoppe the mouthes of such calumniatours: moost souerayne prince: mesemeth ryght co~uenient in this place: somwhat to write aswel co~cernyng the co~modities laudes of hystories: as apertenent vnto myne owne excusacion.
And first knowlege it moch more co~uenie~t: a preest to arme hymselfe with constance holy scripture purenesse of lyfe radyant vertues: and with suche socours armour defended: boldely valia~tly to byd batayle agaynst to pur+sue the obstinate synners of this worlde.
And to co~tende also agaynst the temptacio~s of his carnal co~cupisce~ces agaynst these mundayne blandime~tes delectacions: and agaynst his gostely ennemies suggestyo~s.
For vnder this maner (as affermeth the holy man Iob) man+nes lyfe vpon yerth is but a warfare a very mase of miseries: an circuite of vary able and ineuitable errours.
For certayne deny nat: but that such ought to be the warfare of a man within holy orders: auowed sub+myt vnto ye holy minysteries auters of god.
But this other temperal warre is permytted vnto wordely lyuers: and may nat be omytted: namely in this worlde oppressed with tyra~ny of iniuryous and odyous exactors and oppressours: whose obstinate presumpcions assautes inuasions can nat otherwyse be re+pressed: than by violence armour batayle: vnder ministracion of good and ryghtwyse princes defenders mayntayners of the commen wele.
Than it is lauful: a preest to write suche actes for example of our posterite: for perpetual remembrau~ce of the laudes of good princes which haue ben here in erth the scour+ges of god to correct tyrannes synners.
But great is the laude many be the co~modities vtilities of hystories.
An hystore is the recorder of tymes passed: the lyght of verite: the maistres of mannes lyueng: the presydent of memorie: the messanger of antiquite.
And (as Titus Liuius recordeth in his prologue) the knowledge of hystories among other thinges is most holsome necessary and {pro}fitable.
For euery good example which in them is writen: is set for a warnyng monycion vnto princes and gouernours therby to rule order themselfe: a co~men wele.
And euery exa~ple of miserable fortune of tyrannes is set as a monicion for the same gouernours nat to be of tyrannous behauour lest at last they may fal i~to lyke miserable ruyne calamite.
And also (as sayth Cicero) a man to knowe nothing of that which was done before his tyme reme~brance: that is as who sayth alway to be a chylde.
But it is a thyng very comely: necessary before other: to knowe these cronycles noble actes of auncie~t tyme reme~brance to kepe in mynde the order courses of antiquite: and to haue in mynd the knowledge of exemples for euery mater purpose.
For in likewyse as vnto aged men is more credence auctorite gyuen than to yong men: bycause of experie~ce of many thyng{is}.
So such noble dilige~t mynd{is} as delyteth in redynge hystories: may haue knowlege nat onely of the dedes of one mannes lyfe: but also of the dedes most famous of al tymes syth creation of the world
Wherfor (as sayth Dyodorus) it is a comely fayre thyng moche necessary co~mendable: a man to refourme amende his lyfe by example of an other mannes faut{is} da~mages.
Wherfore Demetrius Phalerus the great philosopher: often warned counselled the kyng Ptolomy to excercise hymselfe in often redyng of bokes of hystories.
For in so doynge: princes shall fynde writen in bokes before their eyen ryght many thyng{is} co~cernyng their wele honour fame: which their frend{is} dare nat be bolde to tell them for drede of dysplesure: fathermore without the knowlege of hystories neuer man coude become good oratour.
For (as affermeth Quintilian) hystories be of such myght and effect that they may norisshe the speche of an oratour withsoft and swete lycour.
These premisses with otherlyke consydered: moost magnificent prince: me thinketh it thing nat inconuenient a preest to write of hystories of warre: and also me thynke both plesant profitable to noble men to exercyse themselfe in re+dyng the same.
For brefely to speke by ryghtwysie batel: the lawes of god man be mentayned: vice vicious men corrected: vertue and good men rewarded and exalted.
Oure fayth agaynst infideles defended: rebellers tyrannes subdued: and finally all thyng{is} directed to due order reduced.
Fathermore the sa+me redyng of hystores semeth to auayle nat a lytel to the knowledge co~tempt of this transytorie pleasure mundayne mysery of this vncertayne lyfe.
For whan hystories represe~t before our syght the valyant and bolde herted knyghtes shyning in armour: richely aparelled: on comely coursers trapped with golde syluer: the goodly order ordynance of a great army of armed shyning in harnesse: fyers prepared redy to batayle: the trumpettes the golden stremers and standerdes blasyng glisteryng agaynst the sonne: and brefely all the grounde ouercouerd with men riches.
What els is all this: but a vayne oste~tation of yertly opulence: and caduke glorie prepared besely assembled laboriously and exposed folysshly furiously vnto distruction {per}dicion.
But agayn anon after: whan we rede se in the same hystories the valiau~t mennes bodyes prostrate: the carkases of kynges dukes erles knyghtes and pages mengled all togyder: all pride conten+cion abated.
The bryght harnesse dyed with blode: the wounded coursers drawynge after them the deed bodyes of their lordes: the men cryeng: the tentes townes brennyng.
What is all this sight wt otherlyke? Forsoth nought els but an euident spectacle of mannes brutall crudelite: and an exa~ple of mundayne vanite: declarynge the immoderat insaciable desyre of dominion of yerthely princes: and prouing that vnto man welth is intolerable co~founded by his owne foly.
These manyfolde and holsome exa~ples: represented before our sight by reding of cronycles: hath moued my mynd to tra~slate this present hystorie forth of latyn into our maternal langage.
But among all other noble men of this region: most hye and myghty prince: ye seme vnto me most worthy and co~uenie~t: to whose grace shuld decycat this hystorie: bothe for myne owne duety to be obserued anenst your magnifycence: and also for the excellent worthynesse of your merites great polycie of chyualry whiche lately haue apered in whyle ye nat with lesse wysdo~e than valyantyse haue vaynquysshed the inua+sour and violent ennemy of the co~men wele of England.
In whiche noble glorious acte ye haue {pro}ued your selfe lyke vnto myghty Marius.
But this omytte: as thynge euidently knowen to euery man: lest myght seme rather to recou~t these your strong dedes for adu+lacion: than for true relation.
Wherfore most myghty magnifycent prince: pleas it your hyghnesse of gracious beniuolence to accepte this smal present tra~slated by yor beedman to pleasure profet of al gentylmen of this region: but namely of your hyghnes of the noble men of your {pro}geny affynite.
But to thintent that this my small gyft somwhat may be augmented: my selfe my seruyce and prayer: offre withall vnto your hygnes.
¶Thus endeth the preface of this present cronycle: by Alexander Barclay preest dyrect vnto the ryght hye and myghty prince Thomas duke of Northfolke.
¶Here begynneth a compendyous extracte contaynyng breffely the effecte and processe of this present cronycle compyled in latyn by the famous Romayn Salust.
And tra~slated into englysshe by Alexander Barcley preest at co~maundement of the ryght hygh myghty prince Thomas duke of Northfolke.
IN this present cronycle or hystory of Rome: is written the batayle whiche the Romayns had with Iugurth vsurper of the kyngdome of Numydy.
The lande of Numydy is parte of the countrey of Affryke.
In whiche raygned somtyme a kynge named Massinissa: felowe and frende to the empyre of Rhome.
This Massinissa had thre sonnes thus named: Micipsa Manastabal and Galussa.
But after the deth of Manastabal and Galussa: the first brother named Micipsa obtayned the kyngdome of Numydy alone without partyner.
For after the custome of Numydy heritages are wont to be deuided among brethern by equal porcions after dyscease of theyr parentes of whome suche heritage issueth.
This Micipsa so crowned kynge of hole Numydy had two sonnes the first called Adherbal the seconde Hiempsall.
But his brother Manastabal whiche was departed before left behynde hym one bastarde sonne named Iugurth: to whom his grandfather Massinissa bequethed none heritage but left hym priuate without lande or lyuelodde for asmoche as he was vnlaufully borne.
The kynge Micipsa was moued with pyte compassyon agaynst this Iugurth: and co~sideryng that he was his brothers sonne without conforte receyued hym into his house and cherisshed hym in all thynges as he dyde his owne sonnes.
This Iugurth as he grewe in stature so grewe he in all gyftes belongynge to nature and became a right strong hardy knyght and also more excellent in wysdome than in courage or myght and was moche elder than the two sonnes of Micispa: named Adher ball Hiempsall.
What tyme Micipsa co~sydered the ouryng age manlynes wysdome of Iugurth.
And on the other parte whan he reme~bred the feble yongth vnexpert of his owne two sonnes in this aduiseme~t his mynde was sore troubled wt drede: after his dethe the same Iugurth myght inuade and vsurpe vnto hymselfe the kyngdome of Numydy his owne two sonnes beyng nat of power to defende the~selfe.
Micipsa after these thyn+ges co~sydred: determined to obiect this Iugurth vnto paryll of warre and by such meanes to assay if it might fortune hym to be slayne in batell.
Therfore what tyme ye romains hauyng Scipio for their capitaine beseged the cyte of Numance: this Micipsa sent vnto the romains to ye same batayle great socours both of horsmen and of fotemen.
This dyde he trustynge that it was possible and lykely ynough that this Iugurth a knyght yonge lusty and desirous of honour myght by some chau~ce of fortune be slayne in batayle as sayd before.
For the boldnesse and strength of Iugurthe in that warre was well proued and knowen.
For many noble and valiant actes of chyualry dyd he: wherby he wanne moche laude and glory with great loue fauour nat onely of Scipio the captaine but also of all the noblest men of the Romayne army.
Insomoche that after this warre was fynisshed: and the cyte of Numance distroyed the captaine Scipio assembled his hole army: and before them all with magnificent and fauorable wordes co~mended Iugurth with merueylous laudes.
This done he rewarded hym with ma+ny riche gyftes of chyualry.
And sent hym agayne to the kynge Micipsa with letters wherin also he commended this Iugurth with great laude and praysyng.
By instigacion of whiche thynges it so befell: that where as the kyng Micipsa nat long before desyred nothyng more than ye deth of Iugurth: nowe he coueted nought somoche as conseruacion of his lyfe helth.
So that nat long after he adopted hym as his sonne and ordayned in his testame~t hym to be one of his heyres partiner of his kyngdome with his two other naturall sonnes.
Whiche ordinau~ce he neuer chaunged but at his departyng increased his fauour and benefites agaynst ye same Iugurth leauynge hym nat onely partiner of his kyngdome but also of all his treasours.
And besyde this decryed hym to be protectour of his two naturall sonnes and of theyr porcions of the kyngdome.
Sone after this ordinau~ce the kyng Micipsa departed fro~ lyfe.
But whan ye thre princes Adherball Hiempsall and Iugurth determined amonge them the tyme whan the treasoure shulde be deuided and the boundes of the kyngdome lymited to them eche one his parte.
At this assem+ble grewe a dissencion betwene Hiempsall Iugurth by occasyon wherof Iugurth shortely after slewe Hiempsall by treason and gyle.
After this Hiempsall was slayne Iugurthe fixed his mynde to possesse the hole kyngdome of Numidy.
Wherfore he prepared a great strong army agaynst the other brother Adherball and at last whan bothe mette in batayle the army of Adherball was ouerthrowen and hymselfe put to flyght.
Adherball thus ouercome and spoyled of his kyngdome fledd vnto Rome and there before the senatours declared the tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth agaynst hym co~mitted and agaynst his brother Hiem+psall cruelly murdred: desiryng socours of the same senatours wt pytefull wordes and lamentable complayntes.
At conclusion it was decreed of the senatours that .x. noble men of Rome shulde be sent embassadours to Numydy to deuyde the kyngdome betwene Adherball and Iugurth indiffere~tly.
The same embassa+dours hasted them to Numydy and dyde the co~maundement of the senate to them inioyned: but more to the fauour of Iugurth than Adherball.
Whan the kyngdome was departed and deuided and the sayd embassadours were also departed from towarde Rome: Iugurth sette his mynde yet ones agayn to inuade and vsurpe the part of ye kyngdome which belonged to Ad herball by assigneme~t of the embassadours.
Wherfore he assem+bled a newe army and with the same i~nuaded his kyngdome: Adherball compelled by necessite assembled also an other army for his part and proceded forthe and mette with Iugurth.
But anone after they ioyned batayle Iugurth ouerthrewe the hoost of Adherball put hym to yght co~strainyng hym to fle with a fewe horsmen about hym into a walled towne nere by named Cyrtha.
In the meane tyme Adherball by letters certified ye senatours of Rome in what state Iugurth had brought hym.
How he was bereft of his kyngdome by crueltie ambicion of Iugurthe: how he was brought to extremite by hunger and force of armes nat able to abyde the besegynge any lenger: how it appered euidently that Iugurth set lytell by the decrees ordinaunce of the senatours And at conclusion of the same letters he humbly besought the senate of ayde and socours in this his extremite.
Whan these letters were redde before the senatours assembled: many of them were: which iuged it thynge expedient and conuenient: to socour Adherball.
And anone to sende an army into Affrike agaynst Iugurthe.
But his frendes whome he hadde bought for money at Rome: made suche resistence that no suche ordinaunce coude come to effect nor passe forthe agaynst hym.
Neuerthelesse newe embassadours were sent ones agayne to Iugurth and that men auncient and of great authorite: to compell and co~maunde hym in name of the senatours to desyst from his entreprise and crueltie in payne of theyr hye displeasure.
Iugurth blynded these imbassadours with fayre wordes and rewardes tyll they were departed agayn from Numidy to Rome wtout any thing brought to ende.
Whan this was knowen at Cirtha where Adherball lay beseged: they whiche were with Adherball within the towne counselled hym to yelde vp the towne to Iugurth vpon co~dicion onely to haue his lyfe pardoned vnto hym.
Adherball constrained by famine and other necessities condiscended to this counsell.
But anone after the towne was yelded Iugurth co~trary to his fayth promes which he had made to Adherbal: slewe hym with greuous horrible tourme~t.
Whan this dede was knowen at Rome: the senatours were sore moued agaynst hym.
Wherfore by commen assent of the senatours and commens of Rome: one named Licius Calphurnius that tyme consull of Rome was sent with a strong army into Numidy agaynst Iugurth.
But with in shorte season this Calphurnius corrupted and accloyed with money by Iugurth made a foule bonde of peace wt hym to great dishonoure and shame bothe of hymselfe and of all the empire of Rome: for which dede the senatours and commens of Rome were greuously displeased.
Wherfore Calphurnius was called home agayne to Rome with great dishonoure and rebuke.
After this Calphurnius an other romayn named Albinus was elect consull and dyrect with newe suppleme~t of warriours into Numidy agaynst Iugurth.
But this Iugurth droue hym forth vnder hope and coloure as if he wolde yelde hymselfe to the sayd so longe tyll at last the tyme approched of election of newe consuls.
Wherfore Albinus of necessite constrayned: and as decrees of the romayns commaunded: retourned agayne to Rome to be at the sayd election (as he was bounde) without any dede laudably done in Numidy.
And at his departinge left behynde hym in Numidy his brother named Aulus: to be captayn in his stede ruler of his army and also of the prouince where the same army soiourned tyll the wynter were ouer passed.
What tyme Albinus was departed towarde Rome: this Aulus blynded by rasshenes and foly behaued hymselfe ryght vndiscretly in his rowme.
In somoche that he called the army vnto viage and warfare forth of theyr tentes in the moneth of Ianuary: in coldest and sharpest season of wynter This dyde he: other bycause he trusted to ende the batayle in his tyme: and so therby to wynne thanke and worshyppe: or els to thente~t to gete money of Iugurh by grau~tyng vnto hym peace rest for his tyme.
Whan Iugurth perceyued this vnexpertnes and rasshe foly of Aulus: he sent vnto hym embassadours as if he were a ferde: by dissimulacion to requyre of hym peace.
And in the meane tyme the same Iugurth ledde his army among hylles wodes fainyng as if he fledde from Aulus for drede.
Aulus vndersta~dyng this persued folowed hym more egarly hastely without aduisment or {pro}uision.
Whan Iugurth sawe that he had attised drawen the Romains into a place to fyght for his auauntage: anone he assayled them embatayled with them fyersly in which batayle he ouercame the romains putte them to flyght.
On the next morne after Iugurth and Aulus came togyder in communicacion.
And at last trewes was stryken bytwene bothe parties in this maner by such co~dicions: that all the romains shuld passe vnder a spere in signe of subieccion and that they were ouercome without more hurt.
And afterwarde within ten dayes all shulde depart out of Numidy so was it done.
Whan tydyng{is} herof were brought to rome: all the citie was troubled with drede displeasure.
After this shamefull trewes of Aulus and disconfiture flyght of the romayne army a noble man named Metellus was creat consul of Rome by co~men assent sende vnto Numidi agaynst Iugurth.
This Metellus behaued hymselfe as a noble captaine and valiaunt warriour: and perceyuynge that the residue of the army which was escaped was disolute and out of order by ouer moch libertie.
And by faute of the captains which were before he first of all reduced the sowdiours to good rule and order acordynge to the auncient ordinaunces of chyualry: and than in tyme conuenie~t after his army was brought to order he assailed Iugurth fyersly.
And after certayne sharpe and greuous batayles he diminished his riches his myght power brought hym almost to extremite.
After this Metellus: one named Marius last of all was creat consul and the prouince warre of Numidy decreed and co~mitted to hym.
This Marius anone pursued Iugurthe in batayle moost sharply fiersly of all other insomoche that finally he vtterly brought hym to extremite: his frendes his riches and power brought all to nought.
And at conclusion by treason betrayeng of one Bocchus kyng of the Mauriens: Iugurthe was deliuerd to the same Marius as prisoner: whome he ledde bounde to Rome with great glory triumphe.
At last this Iugurth was throwen into prison where at conclusion he ended his miserable lyfe in dolors captiuite.
This is the argument and processe of all this hystory and cronicle: in whiche the redar of whatso euer condicion and degre he be: shall fynde both profite and pleasure: if he redde it attentyfly and with good aduertens.
And moost namely gentylmen apt to attayne to glorious fame honour by fayt of chyualry: shall fynde both pleasaunt and profitable pastime in redyng this hystory: vnto whose example profite and pleasure chefely haue translated the same.
¶The prologue of this present cronycle compyled in laten by the famous romayn Salust: and tra~slated into englysshe by Alexander Barcley preest.
MAnkynde wrongfully complayneth of his naturall dysposicion: sayeng that his feble frayle lyfe of short co~tinuaunce of tyme is rather ruled by chau~ces of fortune: than by {pro}uision of strength or vertu.
But if man wel co~sy+der his natural i~clinacion: co~trary to such opinion: he shall fynde that nothyng longynge to mankynde may be founde proued greater better or more preemine~t than his naturall inclinacion: and yt his owne dilige~ce exercyse rather fayleth hym than outher myght or longe continuau~ce of lyfe tyme.
But in this opinion to iuge indiffere~tly: let man vnderstande that the mynde is ordayned gyder ruler captayne of ma~nes lyfe: which mynde: whan it valyantly inte~deth to attayne to worshyp dignite by way of vertu: it is excellent ynough myghty and clere of it selfe: so that it nedeth nat to force of fortune nor to care for her vncertayne gyftes: but to dyspise her as nat able to gyue to any man honesty diligence or other good and vertuous exercises: nor able to depriue man agayne of the same gyftes: after he hath obtayned ye same.
But on the other part if this mynde of ma~ taken blynded wt frowarde pleasurs be subdued vnto slouthe bodyly lustes: after it hath exercised occupied such ieo{per}dous pleasure by a lytel season: after that by cowardous slouth both the strength the tyme the wyt ar vanis+shed away decayed: than anone the infirmite of nature is accused put in blame.
And thus all such slouthfull doers tra~spose lay away the faute which in themself is culpable vnto the difficulte of such besynesses as they haue omitted by neglige~ce.
But if it were so: that men had as great cure affeccion of thyng{is} good and profitable as they haue desyre pleasure in sekyng folowyng thyng{is} co~trary vnto them nothyng {pro}fitable ye: also moch {per}ylous hurtfull: than shuld nat they be more ru+led by ye chau~ces of fortune than they shuld rule ye sayd chau~ces.
And thus shulde they attayne procede vnto so great excellence: that where they be mortall of nature they shuld be made i~mortall by glory renowmed fame.
For in lykewyse as man is co~posed made of .ii. thyng{is} (that is to say of the body soule) right so all thyng{is} all besynesses exercises to mankynd belongyng foloweth some ye nature of the body: to decay brefely to be mortall: as it is some other folowe ye nature of the soule to be eternall i~mortall: as it is.
Which thing forther to {pro}ue by exa~ple: we dayly se that ye goodly beauty of ye visage shape of ma~kynde great abondau~ce of riches also the strength of the body with all other suche thynges semblable decayeth vanyssheth away within short tyme.
But co~trarely ye excellent worthy actes: belongyng to ma~nes wyt: be i~mortall euerlastyng: as the soule is i~mortall.
And finally in lykwyse as ye begynnyng of ye gyftes cor{per}all or na+turall of the gyftes of fortune is caduke vayne vncertayn: ryght so is the ende of ye same mutable tra~sitory.
And all thyng{is} which be borne and sprygyng: agayne decayeth approcheth to deth: and whan these same be growen encreased to the hegth of theyr perfeccion: agayne they begyne to decay and consume by age and debilite.
But the mynde and soule beynge incorrupt eternall and gouernoure of mankynde ruleth and weldeth all thynges: but it selfe can nat be violently ruled nor compelled by any thyng erthly co~syderyng the frewyll whiche it optayneth of his creatour.
For which consyderacion the frowarde iniquite of them is more to be marueyled: which subdued to the ioyes plea+sures of the body passe forthe the tyme of theyr lyfe in carnall lustes and ydelnes.
But towchyng theyr wyt (whiche is the best gyft and grettest treasure grau~ted to mankynde) that suffre they to slomber and to slepe without exercise in slouthe and ydelnes: whose dulnes surely is somoche more to be blamed: namely syth so many and diuers noble exercises occupacions of the mynde be: by whom moost clere nobles and fame vndefyled may be optayned.
But of suche diuers exercises concernynge the mynde some are better refused: than procured in troublous tymes inquiet.
And namely in this tyme turbulent and season vnquiet: great offices lordshyppes rowmes to commaunde rule: and brefely to speke.
All maner cure co~cernyng the administracion of thynges apparteynyng to the commen wele: semeth vnto me nat at all to be couyted or desyred of any wyse man.
For neyther is honoure gyuen vnto vertue as condigne rewarde and worthy therto belongyng nether suche as haue goten iurisdiction honour by aude vnlaufull meanes (in lyke case) can nat be more sure nor more honest by meane of such honour so vnright wysly obtayned.
For certenly a man to rule his countrey kynred by myght violence: all if he haue power so to do also though he ryght wysly correct ye crimes of tra~sgressours misdoers.
And often at co~clusion more perilous dau~gerous: than it is sure or {pro}fitable that namely syth all mutacions of thynges and chaunges of gouernours pretende and thretten slaughter of some exile or wylfull flyght imprisonme~t with otherlyke cruelties more longyng to ennemyes of a co~men wele than to defe~ders of the same.
Than forthermore: a man to labour to ye vttermost of his power and all in vayne.
And in weryenge hymselfe to gete nought els but euylwyll and hatred: it is a point of extreme vtter madnes except perchau~ce it be such one whiche hath a dishonest a foule perilous pleasure to cast away for nought his owne worshyppe and libertie for pleasure of a fewe myghty men vsurpers of dominion lordshyp.
But among all other besinesse which are exercised by ma~nes wyt the redyng of hystories the reducyng of the same to memory: is moch more necessary {pro}fitable to all degrees beryng rule of a co~men wele but most namely vnto pri~ces.
Of power profet co~modite wherof: purpose at this tyme to passe ouer wt silence bycause many other authours haue wryten of the same before my tyme.
And also that no man shulde suppose my selfe by pride or insole~ce: to bost myne owne study vainly laudyng ye same.
But moch co~trary beleue rather yt some enuious maligners shalbe herafter which shall obiect ascribe a name of slouth and neglige~ce to this my labour.
How great profitable so euer it be: that bycause haue determined to lede my lyfe solitarely: ferre from medlyng with the co~men wele.
Certainly (as suppose) they onely shall impute and ascribe suche name to me and to this my laboure: whiche thynketh it a moost great singular craft or practised wysdome to wynne beniuolence by salutyng the co~men people and by dyssimulate reuerence done to euery man passyng by them or els to gete fauour by festyng and flateryng the commenty.
Whiche enuious maligners: yf they wolde co~sider bothe in what maner seasons and in what ieopardous tymes haue obtayned offices and rowmes of auctorite what men wold gladly and yet myght nat obtayne suche rowmes Moreouer yf they call to mynde what maner of men afterwarde came into the order of senatours For certayne if my wyllers consider inediffere~tly these premisses: than shall they thinke that haue chaunged the purpose of my mynde: more for cause reasonable: and by good aduiseme~t than for slouth cowardise and they shall fynde that more profet shall come to the commen wale by this my study (which they count but ydelnes and tyme misspent) than of the labour and besynes whiche other men take vpon them fayntly and iniustly administryng the commen wele.
And they shall fynde that my writing shal proue itselfe more laudable and profitable to the co~mente than theyr vndiscrete gouer+naunce.
For often haue herde of the famous princes Quintus Maximus Publius Scipio and besyde these of many other ryght famous and worthy men of the citie of Rome which whan they behelde the ymages of theyr forefathers made of stone of waxe or of metall and erect into hye trones in memoriall of the valiaunt and magnificent actes by them done for the commen wele: the sayd princes in aduisynge such ymages were wont to say vnto suche as stode nere by them: that theyr myndes were gretly kyndeled to vertue and nobles in co~templyng of the same.
The case is playne: yt suche figures of metall stone or waxe had nat such operacion nor myght within themselfe.
But such hygh courage flame was kyndeled and increased in the hardy hertes of such noble men and valiant warrious by remembrau~ce of the glorious dedes of theyr forfathers in theyr lyfe tyme done represe~ted to their memory by such ymages insomoche that this flame kyndled in theyr hertes to vertu coude neuer be slaked nor saciate in them tyll tyme that they were equall with their forefathers in vertu fame and glory.
Than how moch more ought the clere descripcion of hystores to kyndell vnto boldnes and vertu the myndes of noble men by redyng of the same.
But moche contrary if we aduert the worlde as it is now among all men which lyue and conforme themselfe to the maners vsed nowe adayes where shall we fynde one: but that wyll striue and contende with theyr forefathers to ouercome them other in couetise superfluous riches or els in prodigalite wastfull expences and nat in honest and laudable lyfe good excercices and diligence? And moreouer gentylmen of ye first heed which were wont to preuent auncient noblemen ascende vnto vertu nobles by vertuous maners: such laboure now to lordshyp honour and authorite by fraude falshode: rather than by very vertu or good meanes laudable.
After suche maner as if the office of a hye Iuge of a Tresourer a Co~sull a Prouost and all such other great offices were noble and excelle~t of themselfe.
And nat in maner as if suche offices shulde be counted of worthynes and dignite: after as the vertue and honour is of suche as rule in the same offices and hy rowmes.
But playnly affirmyng the treuth: the man maketh the office noble worshypfull: yf his maners shyne by vertue.
But yf his conuersacion be contrary no office no rowme can make hym noble nor worshypfull.
But this omittynge haue proceded in this prologue with ouer ferre circu~staunce and also with somwhat to moche libertie of wordes more than in a preface is requisite: for that it pyteeth me of these tedious maners of this oure cite of Rome.
But nowe wyll come to my mater purposed and first interpryse begon.
¶Of what mater Salust intendeth to treat in proces of this boke and what causes moueth hym of suche mater to write.
IN this warke purpose to wryte of the warre whiche the Romayns had and executed agaynst the tyranne Iugurth wrongfully vsurpynge the name of a kynge ouer the lande of Numidy.
Many causes moueth me by writynge to commende this warre to perpetual memory.
First for that in the same was foughten at many tymes with great multitude of men on eyther partie with moche cruell murdre and variable victory: the Romains somtyme somtyme the Iugurthins preuaylyng in victory.
Forthermore bycause that first at this batayle: from thens forwarde the commen people of Rome matched with the princes resistynge theyr pride.
For where as before this tyme the noble men of Rome oppressed and subdued the commens with vnreasonable rigoure the commens elect one named Marius a man of basse byrth to be co~sull of Rome and captaine in this batayle: whiche after he had obtayned victory ouer Iugurth with great glory triumphe fauour of the commontie he supported them in such wyse agaynst the noble men: that of the same rose a ciuile bataile greuous discorde bytwene the noble men and co~mens of Rome: Marius maintenyng the co~mens partie Silla susteyning ye partie of the noble men.
Insomoch yt finally bytwene these two {per}ties captayns of ye same was foughten an vnkynde vnnaturall cruel batel: to ye greuous ruine of ye Romay+ne empire subuercion of the co~men wele.
Which co~tencion and variaunce confounded bothe the lawes of god and man and by the same were all good ordinau~ces disordred.
And this same furious debate foly proceded at last to so vnresonable madnesse and excecate fury that it neuer desisted nor this variaunce and discencion bytwene the noble men and commens neuer ceased: tyll tyme that cruell and mortal batayle foughten bytwene both parties and tyll tyme that also distruction of the lande of Italy co~pelled both parties at last to consyder theyr owne blynde foly cruell furor: so finally to mittigate fynisshe their debate vnresonable dyssencion.
But fyrst or begyn to write of this batell shall repeat and declare a fewe thing{is} done before this warre began: to thentent that all thing{is} moost chefe worthy expedie~t to be knowen may be more euide~t open clere to the reders.
¶How the kyng Massinissa came into the fauour of the Romayns and how the lande of Numydy was committed vnto hym.
THe Romayns had thre notable and famous batayls agaynst the Carthagine~ces in which the same Romayns had great dammage.
Howbeit in conclusion of euery batayle they wanne victory of theyr en+nemyes: in the seconde of these batayles what tyme Hanyball duke and captayne of the Carthagine~ces wasted the welth and riches of Italy more than any other ennemy had euer done before after the Romayns began~e to haue any great name and to delate theyr dominion: famous prince named Massinissa kynge of the lande of Numydy was receyued into frendshyppe fauour of the Romayns: by one Publius Scipio captayne of the sayd Romayns which Scipio afterwarde for his manhode was named Scipio Affrycan bycause he ouercame subdued the lande of Affrike.
This Massinissa so receyued into fauour of the Romayns in the foresayd batayle dyd many noble and famous actes of chyualry with hygh valiantise corage.
For which dedes: after the Romayns had ouercome ye Carthaginencis theyr cite: and after they had taken prisoner the kyng Sciphar which had in Affrike a worthy great large impire the people of Rome gaue frely vnto the same kynge Massinissa all suche cities landes as they had taken and wone in batayle.
For which benefites so magnifice~t ample Massinissa co~tinued vnto them in profitable faythfull frendshyp his lyfe induryng: but at last his lyfe ended and the welth of his empire decayed al+so with hym.
This kynge departyng left behynde hym thre sonnes: whose names were Micipsa Manastabal and Galussa: of whome Micipsa succeded his father and alone obtayned the kyngdome: after that this other two brethern Manastabal and Galussa were departed frome this lyfe by sickenesse.
But Manastabal his brother whiche departed (as sayd is) left behynde hym one sonne nat laufully borne but a bastarde begoten of his co~cubine: wherfore departyng he left hym orbate without lande or lyuelode.
This co~sydering Micipsa suffred hym nat to faute nor decay: but forasmoche as he was his brothers son~e receyued hym into his court hym cherysshed in lykewyse as he dyd his owne sonnes Adherball and Hiempsall.
This Iugurth after that he was a lytell growen vp to age: was myghty in strength comely and fayre of face: but moost of all excellent of wyt wysdome.
Nor he gaue nat hymselfe to be corrupt with lust nor incrafty slouthe: but as is the custome maner of the people of Nu+midy hymselfe he exercised somtyme in rydyng somtyme in castyng the dart iustyng and somtyme in ronnyng wrestlyng with his companyons of lyke age.
And nat withstandynge that in laude and prayse he passed all his perys: yet none enuied hym but he was derely beloued cherysshed and lauded of all men.
Moreouer he passed moche of his tyme in huntyng of wylde bestes whiche in that lande habounded: he was the first or one among the first which durst assaile and stryke the lyon and other cruell and wylde bestes: he dyde moche: and lytell sayd or bosted of hymselfe.
For suche demeanour his vncle Micipsa at first begynnynge was gladde and ioyefull: supposynge that in tyme to come the manly behauour and strength of Iugurth shuld be glo+ry and honour to all his kyngdome.
But afterwarde in processe of tyme whan he co~sydred and vnderstode his lyfe approchynge fast to ende his naturall sonnes yong vnexpert.
And this yong man Iugurth in honour and fauour dayly encreasyng more and more he reuolued many thynges in mynde greatly moued with suche solicitude and besynesse.
Forthermore he consydred that all men of kynde be naturally inclined to desyre to rule and commaunde by lordeshyppe: rather than to be ruled and subiect.
And howe man is prone and hedlynge inclined to fulfyll the desyers of his mynde dredynge no daungers: nor suspectynge no peryll whyle he is by ambicion and desyre of lordshyp.
Moreouer aduisyng the oportunite of his owne age and of the age of his chyldren which for yongh were nat able to resyst any power or violence: whiche oportunite is wont to be nat small confort audacite and courage nat onely to bolde herres but also to meane men and cowardes intendyng to conspyre agaynst theyr princes in hope of pray and promocions.
Such consyderacyons feared sore the mynde of Micipsa besyde these his drede and dolour was more augmented: whan he behelde the fauour hertes of all his subgettes of the lande of Numidy vtterly inclyned to Iugurth: wherfore to put to deth the same Iugurth by any gyle (as his purpose was to do) he drad moost of all: dowtyng lyst therof myght succede bytwene hym and his subgettes some insurrexion or batayle.
Micipsa compased on euery syde with these difficulties was sore troubled in mynde.
And whan he sawe that nother by strength nor gyle he myght distroy a man so well beloued of the commens (as was Iugurth) at last he deuised an other way to ryd hym: and that without dau~ger or suspeccion wherfore Micipsa aduertyng that Iugurth was redy of hande to stryke and moche desyrous of honour and laude of chyualry he concluded with hymselfe to obiect hym to daunger and peryll of warre: and by that meane to assay the fortune of batayle.
¶Nowe at the same season the Romains warred agaynst a cite of Hispayne named Numance: vnto whiche warre diuers kynges to the commens associate sent vnto them socours agaynst the same cite.
Amonge whome Micipsa also sent a fayre company of horsmen and fotemen: ouer whome he made Iugurth captaine: and sent hym forth with them into Hispayne trustyng that ther he lightly shuld be ouerthrowen and slayne in batayle: other in shewynge his manhod and strength or els by fyersnes and crueltie of his ennemyes.
But this thyng for tuned moche contrary to his opinion.
For Iugurth was of mynde and courage valiaunt and bolde and of wytte quicke and redy so that after he had parceyued the disposicion behauour and maners of Publius Scipio: at that tyme captayne of the romains and whan he had consydred also the maners of his ennemyes he behaued hymselfe in suche wyse with moch labour besynes and cure in obeyng his captaine with so good maner often tymes countryng his ennemyes without drede of perill.
Insomoch that within short tyme he came to so great fame and worshyppe that vnto the romains he was marueylous dere and well beloued and of the Numantines drade as deth: and certaynly among the chefyst he was worthy and valiaunt in batayle: and also good of counsell of wysdome pregnaunt and circumspect.
Which two thynges be moche harde to be in one man both togyder: for wysdom is often wont to make men a ferde and to drede many peryls bycause of prouidence.
But boldnes and audacite causeth men to be rasshe and folehardy bycause of haut courage.
But his wysdome directed his strength and his strength was obedient to wysdome.
Wherfore Scipio the captaine dyd almost euery ieopardous and wyghty thyng by hand counsell of Iugurth: hym countyng among his chefe frendes and dayly cherysshed hym more more and no marueyle for there was no cou~sell nor interprise begon of Iugurth frustrate or in vayne but al came to good effect.
Besyde these gyftes aboue sayd he was curtes of mynde lyberall and of wyt ryght discrete prudent: by which gyftes he adioyned vnto hym many of ye romains in familier frende+shyp.
At that same season in the army of Rome were ryght many newe: and also auncient gentylmen whiche set more by riches than goodnes or honeste.
At home in Rome were they sowers of dyscorde and debatfull great in fame amonge the frendes of the romains.
But more famous by worshyppe and rowme than by honest conuersacion.
These kyndled the mynd of Iugurth nat a lytell promisyng often tymes and sayeng to set his courage on fyre: that if the kyng Micipsa discessed the tyme shulde come that Iugurth alone shulde enioye the hole kyngdome of Numidy without any partyner.
For in hym (they sayd) was great vertue great manhode strength audacite with wysdome able to gouerne suche a kyngdome: and nothynge was so iniust and false but that myght be iustifyed at Rome for gold and all thynges were there to be solde by couetyse of noble men.
¶Howe Publius Scipio counselled Iugurth at his departynge after the cyte of Numance was dystroyed.
THus contynued Iugurth in the romains army in Hispayne with great fauour of ye romains and namely of Scipio the captaine: tyll at last the army of Rome had distroyed the sayd cite of Numance.
Than Publius Scipio concluded to retourne agayne to Rome: and to congye and licence suche socours as were sent vnto hym from other kynges: amonge all other he called Iugurth vnto hym: and before the multitude of all the army assembled lauded and commended hym magnificently recitynge his glorious actes and manly dedes of chyualry.
And after that worthely and rychely rewarded hym for his labours.
This done: he conueyed hym into the captains tent: and there secretly warned hym that he shulde co~tinue and worshyppe the frendshyppe of the people of Rome rather hole togyder and commenly than priuately leanyng to any singuler rulers.
Moreouer addynge these monicions: that he shulde nat rather rewarde and be liberall to a fewe priuatly: than to a hole co~mente sayeng that it was a perillous thyng to bye that: of a fewe persons: whiche belonge vnto many in commen.
If he wolde perseuer and contynue in so noble condicions as he had begon: he shulde shortely come to great honour glory and dignite royall more than he wolde desyre.
But if he wold procede and labour to ascende ouer hastely than shuld both he and his riches fall heedlynge to ruyne and decay.
After Scipio had sayd these wordes with such lyke: he licensed Iugurth to depart and sent hym vnto his vncle Micipsa agayne into the lande of Numidy with letters direct vnto the same kyng Micipsa: of whiche letters the tenure and sentence hereafter ensueth: and was suche.
¶The sentence of the letter dyrect from Publius Scipio captaine of the romaine army in Hispayne vnto Micipsa kynge of Numidy.
PVblius Scipio captaine of the romain army in Hispayne sendeth helth and salutacion to Micipsa kynge of Numidy frende and felowe of the empire of Rome.
The vertue strength and noblenes of your neuewe Iugurth whome ye sent vnto our socours hath ben proued in this warre of Nu+mance ferre excellent aboue any other warriour of our retynue which thyng knowe for certayne is to your great pleasure gladnes.
For his worthy merytes he is right dere and well beloued vnto vs.
And we shall deuoyr vs to the best of our power that he may be lyke dere and well beloued of all the senatours and people of Rome.
am surely ryght ioyefull on your behalfe of this your treasoure Iugurth: thau~cient amyte bytwene you me: byndeth me to be gladde of this your commodite.
For certaynely lo here haue ye a man of Iugurth worthy to discende of such noble stocke as ye ar and as his grandfather Massinissa was in his dayes: whome he foloweth in all pointes of vertue and magnanimite.
WIth these letters of Scipio Iugurth retour+ned into Numydy vnto his vncle Micipsa: where he was worthely ioyefully receyued of the co~mentie.
But after that the kyng Micipsa vnderstode by these letters of commendacion of the captaine Scipio: that the valiau~t and noble actes of Iugurth were trewe: which longe before he had harde by report of the commen fame: than what for the nobles of Iugurthe fauour bothe of his dedes and commendacion of Scipio he moued his mynde chaunged from his foresayd purpose and nat forther intended to oppresse Iugurth by malice nor enuy.
But concluded to attempt to ouercome hym with benefites kyndnesse: to thentent that he so ouercome shuld nat in tyme to come fynde in his hert for pyte to indommage hym nor his heyres.
And soone after this purpose the same Micipsa adopted Iugurth vnto his sonne: and farthermore decreed and ordayned in his testament that Iugurth shulde be one of his heyres: and partener in possession of his kyngdome togyder with his two naturall sonnes Adherball and Hiempsall.
But a fewe yeres after this ordinau~ce Micipsa what by age what by sykenesse drewe nere vnto his ende of lyfe and was consumed by age dysease: wherfore consideryng his deth so fast approchyng it is sayd that he called Iugurth before hym and than before many of his frendes and kynsmen: also in pre+sence of his two naturall sonnes Adherball and Hiempsall he had to the same Iugurth suche wordes as herafter insue and folowe.
¶The exhortacion which the kynge Micipsa a lytell before his deth had to Iugurth.
MIdere sonne Iugurthe knowe it is nat out of your remembraunce: howe after that ye had lost your father my brother charitably louyngly receyued you yonge of tender age into my kyngdome: what tyme ye were without riches without confort: and without any hope of confort or ryches but very lykely to haue ben caste away.
This dyde thynkyng that for these my benefites and kyndnesse shulde be vnto you nat lesse intyerly beloued than of myne owne naturall chyldren with my body begotten.
For why to ouerpasse your other great magnificent and excellent dedes of you valyauntly done before: specially now last of all co~myng from the warre of Numance ye greatly adourned inhaunced to honoure and glory bothe of myne owne persone this my kyngdome.
And where as the romains in fore tymes were frendes vnto vs: by your vertue and manly actes ye haue establysshed that amytie: and of frendes made them moche more frendes.
So that in Hispayne the name glory of our housholde by your manhode is renouate and renewed.
Thus finally: ye haue ouercome the enuy of your ylwyllers onely by your glorious actes and valiau~t interprises: whiche is one of the moost har+dyest thynges to be done amonge mankynde and of moost difficultie.
Wherfore nowe my sonne Iugurth: sythe it is so: that nature hath nere concluded the ende of my lyfe: admo+nest charge and exhorte you by the fayth of your right hand and by the fayth and fidelite whiche ye owe to this my kyngdome obtest and requyre you that ye loue mentayne and cherysshe these my two sonnes Adherball Hiempsall: which of kynred be nere to you and by my benefite and kyndnes are bretherne vnto you.
Forthermore exhorte you that ye cou~tenat leferre and more pleasure to acquaynt and co~ioyne vnto you forayns or straungers rather than to retayne suche as be ioyned to you by naturall blode kynred.
For neyther is a great army of men nor habundance of treasours: ye socours or defence of a kyngdome: but moche rather trusty and faythfull frendes: whome a man can neyther by force of armes: nor yet bye with golde nor syluer to parseuer in stedfast amyte: but they be kept by kyndnesse good dedes fidelite and faythfulnesse.
But among all frendes: who can be more frendly and stedfast in amyte than brother to brother.
Certaynly none ought to be more louyng of naturall inclinacion.
Or what strau~ger shal ye fynd faythfull and trusty to you: if ye shewe yourselfe ennemy to your owne kynsmen? For sothe if ye co~tynue togyder honest good and louynge in agreable concorde bytwene yourselfe: thanne this kyngdome which committe and vnto you shall continue sure and stedfast: as it is nowe.
But co~trarely if ye be yll and disagreynge among yourselfe ye shall in short season make it ryght poore feble and incertayne.
For by loue peace and concorde: small ryches small lordshyppes and generally all small thynges increase and multiplie: by discorde the grettest thynges of the worlde decay and fall vtterly to ruyne.
But you my sonne Iugurthe bycause ye passe these myne other two naturall son~es in age and wysdome therfore it semeth you so moche more than them: to make suche wyse prouision bothe for yourselfe and for them also that nothyng happen otherwyse than well.
For in euery stryffe and debate: howe be it he whiche is myghtyer and rycher often suffreth iniury.
Neuerthelesse it semeth more that he dothe wronge thanne suffreth: bycause that he is more of power and myght thanne his feble aduersary.
But ye my dere sonnes Adherball and Hiempsall se that ye worshyppe and loue this Iugurth your worthy vncle.
And bewarre that ye nat offende nor dysplease hym: but folow his vertue manly behauour.
And do your deuoir to the best of your power after his example behauynge yourselfe so discretely and so wysely that it be nat hereafter reported by me that haue takenne vnto me by adoption better chyldren thanne haue begotten.
How beit Iugurth well perceyued the kynges wordes: but fayned and spoken agaynst his hert: if any other remedy myght haue ben fou~de: neuertheles he answered benygnely for the tyme all if he thought and reuoulued in his mynde moche otherwyse and contrary to his humble and mylde answere.
¶Howe the kynge Micipsa departed from lyfe and of the first cause of dissencion and discorde betwene Iugurth Adherball Hiempsall.
NAt longe after the kynge Micipsa decessed whose dethe was dolourous and sore bewayled of all his subgett{is}: but most of all to his naturall sonnes it was to be la+me~ted: and nat without great cause as the processe of this hystorie shall afterwarde declare.
But after the kyng{is} funerall exequies were magnificently ended as apertayned to his state royall.
The thre princes that is to say Adherball Hiempsall and Iugurth anone assembled to the intent to commen and treat of busynesses of the royalme co~cernynge particion and separation of the same: and all other thynges conuenient.
But whan they shulde sytte and take their places in order: Hiempsall yongest of the thre was somwat fyers of nature and disposed to statelynesse.
And in mynde longe before this tyme he disdayned the ignobilite of Iugurth for asmoche as he was vnlyke vnto them of byrth towchynge his mothers syde and a bastarde borne: as is sayd before.
Wherfore he dysdayned that the same Iugurthe shulde haue the place of moost honoure among them whiche were naturall sonnes of a kynge and also laufully borne: and so in contempt of Iugurth he set hym selfe downe on the ryght hande of his brother Adherball: to thyntent that Iugurthe shulde nat syt in the myddes bytwene them: whiche rowme the Numydyens count of most honour.
And afterwarde howbeit his brother Adherbal requyred hym often to gyue place to Iugurth bycause of his age: yet vnnethes coude be with moche payne induce hym therto: but at laste fatygate by requestes of his brother and of other noble men of the realme: he chaunged his place and set hym vpon the other syde with countenau~ce declaryng his mynde nat co~tented.
And thus at laste satte Iu+gurth for his age in the myddes bytwene them bothe as in place of moost honour.
Whanne the thre princes were thus sette and had communed of many thynges concernynge the adminystracion of the kyngdome: amonge many and dyuers other thynges Iugurth sayd that all the statutes and ordynaunces whiche the kynge Micipsa hadde made fyue yeres before his deth ought of congruence to be adnulled as of none effecte.
For in that season (as sayde he) his wyt what for age what for syckenesse was feble dull and of small valoure.
And therfore suche thynges as he had in that space enacted were done without wysdome or reason.
Whanne Hiempsall herde Iugurth thus speke: he answered sayenge that it pleased hym ryght well that it shulde so be done.
For within the same thre yeres (sayd he) our father Micipsa hath adopted you to his sonne and in his testame~t ordayned you to be partiner of his kyngdome: whiche was the worst and most vnaduised dede that euer he dyd yonge or olde.
Wherfore Iugurth accordynge to your owne ordynaunce this must fyrst of all be adnulled and broken whiche done my brother and shall nat greatly contende for the remenant.
These wordes of Hiempsall pearsed the hert of Iugurth more profou~dely thanne any man there thought or suspected.
Wherfore from that tyme forwarde: what for wrathe of these wordes and for drede of losse of his porcyon of the kyngdome his mynde was in great trouble and anguysshe.
In somoche that from thens forthe: he went aboute ymagyned ordayned and onely reuoulued in his mynde: by what gyle or treason Hiempsall myght be caught in his daunger.
But whanne his purpose proceded but slowly forwarde con+sydrynge that the frowarde desyre and vnrefrenable of his mynde coude nat be mytigated nor pacyfied: he concluded to bryng his enterprise to effect by any maner meanes outher by preuy treason and gyle: or els by euydent and open viole~ce force of armes.
In this first assemble of the thre princes of whiche spake before: it pleased them all that the treasours of kyng Micipsa shulde be deuyded among them bycause of this dyssencion.
And also that the marches and bou~des of eche of theyr dominions seuerally shulde be assigned to eche of them his porcion.
Wherfore the tyme was apoynted and prefixed whanne bothe shulde be done: but the tyme to departe the treasoures was sonner assigned than to deuyde and limitte the boundes of theyr dominions.
This apoynteme~t made: the princes departed company: the mynde of Iugurth nat a lytell inquyeted for the sayde checke of Hiempsall: for whiche cause he awayted his tyme to reuenge hym.
¶How Iugurth by treason murdred Hiempsall the yonger sonne of kynge Micipsa.
WHan the thre prynces were departed in sonder: as haue sayde before: they soiourned in sondry places and that nere to the towre where the treasours lay.
Hiem+psall drewe hym to a towne named Thirmyda nat ferre distant.
In whiche towne he had a dwellynge place: than as happe+ned in the same towne was a man of the garde longynge to Iugurth of his lorde ryght derely beloued and with hym greatly in fauoure.
This seruaunt of Iugurth was moche conuersaunt and familyer in the house of Hiempsall whan Iugurth by chaunce remembred this oportunite to his myscheuous purpose: he called secretly vnto hym his sayde seruau~t.
And after many wordes spoken to serche his mynde: at last by promesse of large rewardes he induced hym to co~sent to go as if were to visyte the house of Hiempsall: as he had often done before tyme: and by some meanes craft to counterfayte the kayes of the gates and brynge them vnto hym.
For the ryght kayes: after the gates were locked: nyghly were delyuerd vnto Hiempsall hymselfe: so myght they nat be vnmyssed the space of a nyght.
Whan Iugurth had induced the Numidian to co~sent to this dede: he {pro}mysed hymselfe wtin shorte tyme after to come to the sayd lodgyng of Hiempsal what tyme ye case shulde requyre: with great power of armed men.
The Numydyan in shorte tyme perfourmed the commaundement of Iugurth insomoche that he brought vnto hym the counterfayted kayes: as he had apoynted.
Iugurth hereof was gladde in mynde: and anone prepared secretly a great company of armed men: whome he commaunded to bringe vnto hym the heed of Hiempsall trenched from the body: and in executynge of this dede he commaunded them all to be ruled by the Numydyan whiche had counterfayted the keys.
This done the sayd Numydyan conuayed these armed men preuyly by nyght into the house of Hiempsall lyke as he was infourmed by Iugurth.
Whan this treatoure satellyte was entred with his company had broken into the inwarde edifices: diuers of them serched for the prince Hiempsall: som murdred his seruauntes as they lay slepynge in theyr beddys suspectynge no suche treason: some other a wakened with the dynne stert vp and mette theyr ennemyes defendynge themselfe but all in vayne: for they had no leyser to arme themselfe.
And therfore were they slayne anone vnarmed of men armed apointed to myschefe: whan the treatours had longe sought Hiempsall and myght nat fynde hym: than serched they more nerely euery hyd corner and secret close places they brast open: all was full of dynne mengled with noyse and clamour: So moche they sought and so nerely: that at last they fou~de out Hiempsall hyd in the cotage of a poore seruyng woman to whiche place he had fled at begynnyg of this affray: as a man astonyed for drede and ignorant of the place.
Anone as the Numidyans had fou~de hym they slewe hym without any mercy.
And as they were commaunded cutte of his heed and brought the same to Iugurth: but shortly after: the fame of this cruell and tyrannous dede was diuulgate ouer spred all the landes of Affrike: Adherball and all they whiche were vnder subieccion of Micepsa whyle he lyued: were sore troubled abasshed with fere for this tyrannous crueltie of Iugurth.
The moost part drewe and leaned to Adherball but suche as were moost manly and best to batayle drewe them to the other partie: and leaned to Iugurth.
Wherfore he made redy as great an army as he myght ioynynge vnto hym and bryngyng vnder his subieccion the townes cities of Numidy: some by violence and some other by theyr owne volu~tary wyll.
In somoch that finally he kept vnder his subieccion and bondage the hole lande of Numidy.
But nat withstandynge that Adherbal had sent embassadours to Rome: to certify the senatours of ye deth of his brother how cowardly he was mur+dred also to informe them of his owne miserable fortune in what case he was: neuerthelesse he made hymselfe redy to fyght wt Iugurth as he which had trust confidence in multitude of his sowdyours assembled redy to batayle.
¶Howe Iugurth ouercame Adherball in batayll and putte hym to flyght: howe Adherball fledde to Rome to co~playne to the senatours: and howe Iugurthe accloyed with rewardes many of the rulers of Rome: by whose fauour his cruelte was defended.
NOw had Iugurth assembled his hoost redy vnto batayle: nat lyke in multitude to the company of Adherbal: but as sayd before moche bolder better expert exercised in warre.
On the other partie Adherball had his people redy apointed and both the armyes approched togyder.
But whan they ioyned batayle and whan it came to byckerynge: that the matter must be tryed with strokes.
Anone Adherball was vanquesshed: and to saue his lyfe fledde from the batayle into a prouince marchynge on the lande of Numidy: and frome thens with all hast spedde hym vnto Rome to complayne his miserable fortune and to requyre socours as shall afterwarde declare.
But than Iugurth whan he had all the lande of Numydy at his pleasure counselled with his frendes of many thynges.
At conclusion: whan he consydred by hymselfe that he had slayne Hiempsall and chased Adherball out of his kyngdome: whan he was ydle and at rest: he often secretly reuoulued in mynde his owne crueltie: sore dredynge what punysshement the Romains wolde ordayne agaynst the same.
Nor agaynst the ire and displeasure of the Romains had he none other hope nor confort saue in the couetyse of the noble men of Rome and in thabundaunce of his treasours: wherwith he trusted to corrupte the rulers of Rome to be fauorable to hym.
This consydred within fewe dayes after he sent to Rome embassadours with moche golde and siluer to whome he gaue in commaundement: that first of all they shulde satisfy his olde frendes with rewardes and money and than to spare no gyftes to get vnto hym mo new frendes.
And brefely that they shulde nat spare nor tary to procure vnto hym fauourers and mainterners of his part: and all thynges for his auauntage by gyftes and promysses.
But after these embassadours were come to Rome: accordyng to the co~maundement of theyr kyng: they gaue and sent to his acquayntaunce and frendes and to suche as amonge the senatours: at that tyme had moost authorite: large and great rewardes.
Insomoche that anone among them was so great a chaunge: that the maruelous enuy hatred and euyl wyll: which they had agaynst Iugurthe was all chaunged into fauour and grace amonge the noble men.
Of whome some were so induced by gyftes receyued: and some other by hope of brybes in tyme to come: that they went about among the senatours from one to one labourynge intretyng that at that season nothyng shuld be extremely nor greuously determined agaynst Iugurth.
Thus after the embassadours of Iugurth had co~fidence and trust ynough in theyr cause they laboured to haue a day apointed to apere in court.
The day of apparence was graunted as well to them as to Adherball: to Adherball as playntife: and to the embassadours as defendentes for Iugurth: whan the day assigned was come bothe the parties appered in court before the senatours than after audience graunted Adherball began to speke vnder forme folowynge for complaint and declaracion of his iniuries and oppression.
¶Here insueth the oracyon of Adherball: deuised in forme deliberatiue: in whiche he exhorteth the senatours to co~maunde socours ayde to be assigned vnto hym prouynge the same to be profitable honest and easy to the Romains to do: profita: ble: that he myght co~tynue a frende vnto the empire of Rome: honest: for his father grandfather had so deserued: easy to be done: for the Romains at that tyme had none other warre els where.
MOost dyscrete chosen fathers and noble senatours: Micipsa my father at houre of his deth co~mau~ded me that shulde thynke nought els of the lande of Numidy to apertayne to me: saue onely the rule and administracion of the same: affirmynge that the title of possession and empyre of the same belonged to you to the people of Rome.
Moreouer he gaue me in commaundement to do my deuoyr: to be vnto you seruiable aboue all thynges: both in place and in warre.
And that shulde count you vnto me in place of kynsmen: and nerest frendes of alyaunce.
Sayenge that if so dyd: than by your amite and frendshyppe shulde fynde socours ryches and defence of the kyngdome of Numydy and of me and myne in all tymes of nede: which precept{is} of my father: whyle kest in mynde to obserue: sodaynly Iugurth the moost cruell cursed of all men whome the grounde susteyneth dyspisyng your empyre: hath dryuen me from your kyngdome from all my other goodes of fortune: nothyng regardynge that am neuew of Massinissa and by myne auncetry a felowe and frende of the empyre and people of Rome.
But certaynly worthy and chosen fathers: syth am come to that misery that necessite co~strayneth me to desyre your ayde and socours: wolde moch rather that myght call for your helpe: for myne owne merytes agaynst you done: than for the merites of my forefathers: and that by suche meanes of myne owne deseruynge your benefites and socours were due vnto me which wolde god that neded nat at all: but if this your socours myght so of you be desyred by my merites deseruyng: than shulde call boldly to you: and vse your socours of duety as myne auncetry haue done in tymes passed.
But nowe syth it is so that honest lyfe and innocence: in this worlde fyndeth lytell surenesse by themselfe without proteccion of some other.
Moreouer syth it was nat in my power to mitigate nor to withstande this tyrannous iniury of Iugurth.
Therfore chosen fathers am nowe fled vnto you as to my chefe refuge coarted to necessitie to requyre your socours and co~strayned to put you to besynes charge: before haue done any pleasure or profet vnto you: whiche thyng greued me moost of all and is one of my gretest miseries.
Ryght worthy senatours other kynges haue ben receyued into yor frendshyppe fauour after ye haue ouercome them in batayle or els perceyuynge themselfe in danger and in doubtfull chau~ches of fortune: they haue coueyted and desyred your felowshyppe and fauour rather for theyr owne wele than for yours.
But moche contrarely: our forefathers and rote of our lynage Massinissa confederated hymselfe with the people of Rome in the seconde batayle of Carthage: what tyme was more faythfulnes to be trusted in them theyr good wyll than of welth or riches to be optayned of the romains beynge at that tyme assayled with warre on euery syde: theyr riches and treasours consumed by often batayles.
Thus it is euident that our auncetry confederat nat themselfe to your felowshyp for theyr owne defence: in hope of riches: in hope of dominion: nor for any other priuate profet but onely for fauour loue whiche they had vnto your empyre.
Wherfore noble senatours suffre nat the progeny and braunches of this stocke to be distroyed.
Suffre nat me whiche am neuewe of your trusty frende Massinissa to aske of you helpe and socours in vayne.
But prude~t fathers: if it were so that had none other cause to demaunde socours of you saue onely this miserable fortune wherwith am oppressed: that whiche was lately a kyng by lineall dyscent: myghty of auncetry: excellent and clere of fame: habundau~t in riches and of men of armes and now dysformed by myserable calamite poore and nedy so that am constrayned to seke helpe socours of other men: if had none other mater wherof to complayne saue this miserable fortune onely.
Neuerthelesse it longeth is conuenient to the magesty of the people of Rome to prohibite to withstande iniury.
And nat to suffre ye kyngdome or dominion of any man to ryse and increase by falshode myscheuous tyranny.
And the ryght heyres agaynst ryght agaynst iustice and agaynst reason to be excluded from theyr true heritage.
But verely am excluded and cast forthe of that countrey which the romayns in tyme passed gaue vnto my forefathers: out of the which countrey my father grandfather accompanyed with your army and helpe: haue chased ye kynge Siphax and also the Carthaginences bothe moost violent enmyes to the empyre of Rome.
Your benefites be spoyled fro me: In this myn iniury be ye dispysed.
Wo is me miserable exulate: Alas my dere father Micipsa ar your gode dedes kyndnes anenst Iugurth come to this poynt and co~clusion: that he before all other shuld namely be dystroyer of your lynage chyldren: whome ye haue made felowe wt your owne son~es: also partyner of yor kyngdome: alas: than shal our stocke houshold neruer be quyet? Shall we alway betossed turned in effusion of blode in batayle in exyle in chasing fro~ our cou~trey.
¶Whyle the Carthaginences raygned in prosperite we suffred and that pacie~tly nat vndeserued all cruelte vexacion For them were our ennemies on euery syde of vs: our frendes in whome we shuld haue founde socour at tyme of nede were ferre disioyned separate from vs.
Thus all our hope: all our trust was in our strength armour.
But nowe after that pestilent dystruction of the Carthaginences is chased casten out of Affrike we co~tinued a tyme ioyfull quyet: passynge our lyfe in peace and tra~quilite for why we had no ennemy: except paradue~ture for any iniury done agaynst you ye wold commau~de vs to take your enmy for ours also as reason and ryght requyred.
But nowe sodaynly vnwarely to vs: this Iugurth exaltynge hymselfe by his intollerable audacite by cruelte pryde hath first slayne my brother his owne nere kynsmam Hiempsall: in augmentynge his myschefe hath vsurped to hym as in pray my brothers part porcion of the kyngdome of Numydy and after: seynge that he myght nat take me lyke maner of trayne as he had done my brother what tyme douted nothynge lesse than any violence or batayle in the kyngdome whiche holde of you he hath chased me (as ye may se) out of your kyngdome and hath made me as an abiect outlawe: chased from my cou~trey: and place oppressed with pouerty laded with miseryes.
In so moche that may be in more suerty saue garde in any place of the worlde than in my owne natyfe cou~trey kyngdome whiche holde of you.
Forsothe worthy senatours: haue euer thought in lyke maner as haue oftentymes herde my father Micipsa openly report with sadnesse: sayeng that they which shuld dilige~tly co~tynue in your frendshyp by theyr me+rit{is} must take great labors at many tymes vpon themselfe in your causes: but of all men they wer most sure from iniury of any man: And sothely all my lynage hath done asmoche as in them was at your desyres: And euer hath ben redy in all batayls nedes to assyst you.
Wherfore if ye folowe the precept{is} of gratitude: if ye bere in reme~braunce these merites of myne auncetry it is bothe right honesty that in this myne extreme necessite ye ayde socour me restore me agayn to quyetnes: whyle ye haue none other busynesses in hand whiche may be to you i~pedime~t i~ this enterprise.
Moost discret fathers: more brefely clerly to declare vnto you my co~plaint my mysery: And also to certify your excellence more playnly of myne vnnaturall vnkynd kynsman Iugurth: and of his cruelte.
It is nat vnknowen vnto yor mageste: that my father Micipsa after his departyng: left behynde hym vs two brethern his na+turall laufull son~es: supposyng that by his benefytes merites Iugurth shulde be ioyned with vs as thyrde brother.
But alas: moche co~trary thone of vs is murdred by this cruell Iugurth blynded by insaciable ambicion desyre of dominion.
And my selfe the seconde brother skarsly and with great difficulte haue escaped his cruell vnmercyfull ha~des: what may do? or whether shall rathest fle for confort vnhappy exulate thus desolate infortunate as am? All the socours all ye co~fort of my stocke kynred is extinct by deth my grandfather Massinissa my father Micipsa: as necessite hath co~strayned them: haue payed ye generall tribute of nature: delyuered from these mu~dayne vexacio~s by naturall deth.
My nere kynsman Iugurth: moch otherwyse than it be came hym to do: hath cursedly bereft my brother of his lyfe by tyranny myscheuous couetise of dominion: myne other kynsmen by co~sanguynite affinite: withall myne other frendes by his cruelte ben also oppressed or put to dethe some by one meanes some by other: some of hym be taken captyue: some put to shamefull deth of gybet galous or crosse wt most cruell tourment: some be casten to wylde rapinous beestes to be of them.
fewe whiche ar left with theyr lyues are closed in dongyons darknes: passyng theyr miserable lyues with mournyng waylyng more greuous than deth.
But if it wer so: that all these socours whiche haue lost by cruelte of Iugurth: or if all thyng{is} which be turned to me: from prosperite to aduersite remayned to this hour hole without detrime~t or da~mage lyke as they were in my best estate: yet certaynly noble senatours: if any yll or mysfortune vnprouided shulde happen vnto me: durst be bolde to call your ayde and confort.
Bycause it semeth you to haue cure of right wrong belongyng to euery man: co~sydryng the excellent magnitude gretnes of your empire and to suffre no vertue vnrewarded nor vice vnpunysshed and finally no wretch oppressed to con+tynue vndefended.
But now moost of all sythe am exulate from my natyf cou~trey from the kyngdome which my father ruled vnder you: and from my owne house dwellyng place also nedy and poore of all thyng{is} belongynge to myne estate and alone without company or defence: to whome or to what place may resorte: or in whome may call for ayde or conforte in these my manyfolde miseries.
Shall resorte or call for socours of nacions or of kynges adiacent and about the lande of Numydy: alas shulde lytell preuayle or nought at all.
Syth all they for your amyte ioyned with you: be mortall ennemyse to vs to our lynage: may resort to any contrey about vs: but that shulde fynde there many tokens of cruelte of warre: which my fathers haue done in theyr tymes passed in your causes.
Whyther shall any of them which haue ben our old ennemis haue mercy or co~passyon on vs nowe in this our extremite.
But finally most noble senatours my father Micipsa thus ordred vs at his departynge: and gaue vs in commaundeme~t that we shulde obserue nor mentayne the frendshyppe of none other kyng nor people saue onely of the people of Rome: and that we shuld seke no newe felowshyp nor newe confederacions or bondes of co~corde sayeng that in your frendshyp helpe: we shuld fynde great socours ayde and that largely.
But if it shuld fortune that ye welth of this your empire shuld fall into ruyne or cha~ge from this excelle~ce (whiche the goddes defende) than: sayde he that we and our kyngdome of necessite shulde also decay togyder with you.
But now lauded be the goddes by whose helpe fauour and by your owne strength vertue: ye be at this tyme myghty riche: all thyng to you is prosperous and to your co~maundement obeyng.
Wherfore it is somoch more laufull easy and conuenient to you to take cure charge in redressyng thin iuries done to yor frendes felowes.
am onely in drede and dout of this one thynge lest the frendshyp singulier fauour of Iugurth: nat parfetly knowen as he is worthy: do induce the myndes of some to parcialite agaynst Iustice and ryght.
here vndersta~de that such labour withall theyr myght for fauour of Iugurth goynge about from man to man prayng and intreatyng with moche solicitude many of you a part by one one desirynge requiryng you to determine no thynge agaynst Iugurth whyle he is absent: the mater and cause nat knowen perfetly: here suche {per}sons corrupt wt parcialite and fauour obiectyng secretly agaynst me and sayeng that fayne and ymagyn these wordes to accuse Iugurth vndeseruyngly and yt fayne to be chased forth of my lande by hym: wher as myght surely ynough haue remayned within the kyngdome of Numidy.
That wold god myght se ones the cursed vnkynde kynsman of myne Iugurth by whose vnmercyfull cruell dedes am casten in these miseries in such case: that he were faynyng the same thynges vnder lyke maner as fayne them at this tyme: and wolde god myght ones se hym as truely wtout faynyng dryuen out of ye land of Numidy as am nowe chased from the same by his cruelty: and wolde god yt at last other ye or els the immortall goddes wold so care for ye busynesses troubles of vs myserable men in erth: that ye same Iugurth which now bereth hy~selfe proud of his synfull dedes shewyng hymselfe countyng hym noble onely bycause he escapeth for his syn~e cruelte: myght therfore suffre greuous punysshme~t wtall my miseries other myscheues yls acordyng to his deseruynge: for his vnmercyfull cruelte shewed agaynst our father Micipsa in murdryng of my dere brother Hiempsall chasyng me forth of my natyfe cou~tre: thus oppressed wt all miseries in extreme necessite.
my brother my brother Hiempsall most dere to my hart of all creatures: howbeit nowe thy lyfe is bereft the in thy flouryng youth longe before thy naturall hour of deth: and yt by cruelte of hym whome it semed nat of all men so to haue done: neuertheles me thynketh in my mynd this chau~ce of thy deth more to be ioyned of: than to be sorowed.
For thou hast nat onely lost thy lyfe thy kyngdome: but also thou hast escaped this chasynge this flyght this exyle this nede this pouerty withall other wretchednesses miseries whiche oppresseth me wtout co~fort or socours.
But vnhappy misera+ble exulate thus throwen downe from my fathers kyngdome into so many yls so great myseries may welbe an example and spectacle to al ye world of the mutable courses wherin fortune turneth mankynd.
my dere brother vncertayne am what do: whyther thus distitute of socour and ayde: may persecute and reueng thy iniuries thy deth or els whether may prouide and seke socours for recoueryng of the lande of Numidy.
am in that case: that my lyfe deth dependeth in the socour of other men.
Wold god were deed out of hande: if deth myght be an honest conclusion of these my miserable misfortunes: rather than to be counted as content pleased to lyue in rebuke and shame as an exulate weryed ouercom with iniuries: and gyueng place to the iniust cruelte of tyran+nous persecucion and as nat able nor bolde to resist the same.
But nowe certaynly it is agaynst my wyll that lyue for in my lyfe haue no lyking nor pleasure and yet can nat dye without dishonour.
Wherfore moost prudent fathers noble senatours: these premisses consydred: obtest humbly requyre you: in honour of the goddes immortall: for thauncie~t amyte bytwene you and my forefathers: for the naturall loue whiche ye haue agaynst your chyldren parentes and by the mageste of the people of Rome: this your most excellent empire: haue pyte of my manyfolde calamitees socour this my misery.
Resist this tyrannous dealyng iniury of Iugurth commytted nat onely agaynst my wretched persone: but also agaynst you and your empire.
Suffre nat the kyngdome of Numidy: which is your owne: to decay and be distroyed by cruell tyranny of Iugurth and by the effusion of blode and murdre of the linage of Massinissa somtyme most faythfull and constant frende of this your empire.
¶Howe the embassadours of Iugurth replyed agaynst these wordes of Adherball: what dyreccion was taken for bothe parties of the senatours of Rome.
AFter that Adherball in forme aboue writen had ended his complaynt: anone the embassadours of Iugurth arose answerd brefely in fewe wordes: as they whiche had more trust confidence in theyr great gyftes gyuen before to many of the rulers of Rome: than in any right of theyr cause and thus they replyed in effecte: sayeng before the senatours that Hiempsall was slayne of the Numidyans for his owne hastines cruelte and nat by knowlege of Iugurth: and as touchyng Adherball: he began warr agaynst Iugurth of his owne froward mynd without any occasion: but after he was ouercome in batayle bycause he was nat able to reueng hym selfe nor to make his partie good he fled vnto Rome to complayne hym to the senators of Iugurth: where as all ye faute was in hymselfe and in none other concernyng the partie of Iugurth: they requyred the senatours in his behalfe in his absence to count hym none other than he was {pro}ued knowen in the warre of Numance: and that they wold nat set more by the wordes of his ennemy than by his dedes magnificently proued.
This sayd: anone after: bothe parties de{per}ted in sonder from the court.
Immediatly the senatours toke cou~sell what best was to be done in the cause.
The fauourers of Iugurth of his embassadours and more ouer a great part of the senatours were corrupt before by parcialite fauour and reward{is} of Iugurth and so deprauat: that they contemned set at nought ye wordes of Adherball exaltyng co~mendyng the manhode of Iugurth: with laude fauour cou~tenaunce voyce and all other signes: And so finally they laboured by all maner of meanes for an others myscheuous vice cruell cryme to defende the same: as if it had ben in defence of theyr owne honour worshyp honeste.
But on the other part were a fewe other whiche set more by iustice and honeste than by false goten riches: these counselled to socour Adherball and sharply to punysshe reue~ge the deth of Hie~psal.
But among all other of this opinion: was one named Emilius Scaurus a man of noble byrth redy to disturbe euery busynes debatful besy: desirous of power of authorite of honour of riches: but crafty in clokyng of these his fautes.
After this Emilius Scaur{us} sawe his gyueng of brybes of Iugurth so shamfully openly knowen: he fered ye corrupcion of the senatours heed rulers of Rome myght inge~der enuy debate slaughter bytwene them the co~mens lyke as in suche cases often had fortuned i~ tymes before.
Wherfore in this co~sideracion he refrayned his mynde at this tyme from his accustomed vnlaufull lustes.
Neuertheles among ye senators in this cou~sell the worst part preuayled: and yt part which set more by fauour rewardes than by right equite ouercam ye other part which to sustayne ye right wtout any fauour or parcialite.
And so the fauourers of Iugurth optayned theyr purpose his cruelte had no punysshme~t.
Neuertheles it was co~cluded decreed that .x. embassadors shuld be sent into Numidy to diuide ye kyngdome which longed to Micipsa bytwene Iugurth Adherbal.
The principal of this embassade was one named Lucius Opimius a man of noble fame of great authorite power among the senatours in those dayes: what ty+me Caius Gracchus Marcus Fuluius great fauourers of the co~mens: were slayne of the noble men of Rome for ye same cause: After victory of the noble men agaynst the co~mens the same two princes: this Lucius Opimius enraged greuously wt rigorous sharpe inquisicions examinacio~s agaynst the poore co~mente: And was one of the chefe oppressers of them.
What tyme this Lucius Opimi{us} wt his co~pany was come to Numidy: Iugurth prepared to attempt his old craftes: And howbeit he had founde the same Lucius for one of his ennemies at Rome neuertheles he receyued hym worshypfully with great dilige~ce.
And wt gyueng {pro}misyng many thyng{is} he brought his purpose so to effect that this Lucius at co~clusion preferred the fauour profet of Iugurth before his owne good name fidelite: brefely: before all thyng{is} belongyng to hymselfe.
This brought to passe: anone he went in hand wt the other of ye embassadors after the same way: many of the~ he wan ouerca~e with gyftes. very fewe of them were which set more by theyr fayth treuth than by money rewardes of Iugurth.
Wherfore wha~ it was come to limitacion separa+cion of the lande of Numidy bytwene Adherball Iugurth as the sayd embassadors were co~maunded of the senatours: that part of the kyngdome which marched toward Mauritany or the lande of the Mauriens beyng most opulent and plentyfull of fruitfull fyldes and of men was gyuen to Iugurth: but the other part which was more pleasant than {pro}fitable as ornate without hauyn townes and fayre edifyces: was co~mytted to possession of Adherball.
¶Nowe for asmoche as in this hystory before most of all in sequele and {pro}cesse of the same hath shalbe made mencion of many places townes of Affrike: to thintent that thystory may be more clere and euident me thynketh it requisite and conuenient brefely to describe the sytuacion of Affrike: and a lytell to touche those peoples and countreis whiche with the romayns had at any tyme amite or frenshyp other peace or warre.
But suche places and nacions whiche for heat and wyldernes be lytell frequented of people or nat inhabited: of them it is nat easy to describe nor declare the truth: for by difficulte of the places fewe or none resorteth thyder perfetly to knowe the same.
But the other partes frequented of people shall as brefely declare as can be touched.
¶The descripcion of the habitable parties of the countrey of Affrike namely of suche nacions as had amyte or warre with the Romayns.
IN diuision of the circle of the worlde the opinion of most writers is: that it is diuided into thre partes Europe Asy Affrike.
fewe other authours hold opinion: that it is deuided onely into two partes that is to say Asy Europe: so that vnder climate of ye part whiche is called Europe: the thirde part named Affrike is co~prehe~ded.
This countrey of Affrike hath his bondes on the see of Italy on the West part and on the occean see it abordeth partly on the same syde: on the Est part therof is a declinyng pendant valey tyght ample large.
Thinha+bytau~tes of this valey call it Cathabathmon in theyr affrike langage: that is to say in englyssh a dependa~t valey.
On this Est syde: the see is outragyous cruell perilous wtout any sure hauen: but the fyldes soyle on this part ar plentyfull of corne and for all maner beestes is good pasture but the soyle is nat apt to trees beryng frute: of water is scarcite bothe of rayne water of water springyng of the erth.
The disposicion of the people is holsome of body swyft may well endure labour.
Insomoche that the most part dye for extreme age saue suche as be slayne wt wepyn or deuoured of wylde beest{is}.
For it is nat often sene ye corruption of humours ingen+dring any infirmite bryngeth to deth.
In this cou~trey be also many rauynous beestes of diuers kyndes deuourynge all thyng which they may ouercome.
But this omityng wyll nowe brefely declare what maner people first of all inhabited this countrey of Affrike and what people thyther resorted to inhabite next after them.
Howebeit that whiche shall write is moche diuers from the commen fame and opinion of many men: neuerthelesse shall folowe the bokes writen in Affrike langage which (as it is sayd) belonged to the yong prince Hiempsall: whome Iugurth murdred: of the same bokes shall folowe the true interpretacion in this mater and lyke as the inhabitauntes of the same countrey afferme to be true.
But touchynge the very credence of the treuth of the mater report that to the authours.
¶The first people whiche inhabited the countrey of Affrike were named Getulians Lybea~s a people hard sharpe vn+manerd.
These lyued of flesshe of wyld beest{is} fedde vpon ye grou~de as beest{is} vnresonable.
And were nat ruled by any ma+ners but lyued wtout lord or lawes as vagabu~des rouers.
They had no certayn byding plac{is} but wher as ye nyght toke the~: ther they rested for ye tyme.
But after yt Hercules dyed in Hispayne as the Affrica~s say: his army which was asse~bled of dyuers nacions whan their captayne and heed was lost: dispersed themselfe abrode anone after his deth and came to dyuers places of the worlde to seke theyr fortune where they myght optayne any habitacion or lordshyppe.
Of whiche company the Medeans Perseans and Armenyans arriued with theyr shyppes in that coost of Affrike which was nerest to the empire of Rome and longe tyme after occupied those costes.
But the Persyans inhabited themselfe more inwarde in the countrey towarde the occean see: and in stede of houses they tourned theyr shyppes botomes vpwarde and dwelled vnder the same.
And no maruayle for in the countre about them grewe no tymber nor other stuffe mete for buyldynge nor of the Spanyard{is} which inhabited next to them neyther myght they bye nor borowe.
For the see was so great tempe+stous bytwene them and theyr langages so dyuers vnknowen to eyther people that by these two i~pedime~tes they were letted from the cors of marcha~dise or excha~ges bytwene the~.
These Persiens by meane of mariages by lytell lytell mengled the Getulyans wt them and bycause they proued oftenty+mes the co~modite of theyr grounde feldes by often co~mutacions chaungyng{is} one with other at last they named themselfe Numidya~s that is to say herdmen deuided.
And to this present daye the cotages or tylmens houses be made longe wt croked sydes or couertures bowyng inwarde as if they were helyes of shyppes tra~suersed or turned vp set downe.
Towchyng ye Medeans Armenyns they ioyned themselfe wt the Libye~s.
For these Medeans Armenie~s dwelled before more nere to the see of Affrike.
The Getulyans inhabited more nere to ye son~e rising: nat farre fro~ the feruent cou~trey of Inde and this people anone had rowmes dwelling places for the see bytwene them Hispayne was but narowe wherfor they agreed with the Hispaniardes to make exchanges bartynges of marcha~dyse with them.
The Lybiens corrupted theyr name by lytell and lytell changyng the same at last in stede of Medyans named the~selfe Maurie~s by barbarike {pro}nunciacion of theyr langage.
But the welth riches of the Persiens in short tyme increased and multiplied.
In somoch that after they had named themselfe Numidyans they increased in so great multitude: that theyr fyrst cou~trey was nat able to norysshe them all: So that afterwarde many of the yong and lusty people departed in sonder from theyr frendes last their countrey resortynge to a countrey nere the cite of Carthage vacant at that tyme: In whiche countrey the inhabited them selfe and named it Numidy after theyr name.
Shortely after this: bothe they whiche remayned styll in theyr first countrey and these which remoued thens assisted one an other withall maner of helpe socours.
Insomoche that what by strength and what by fear they brought vnder theyr subieccion and do+minion suche other nacions as marched nere them: so that within shorte tyme they moche inhaunced augmented their name and glory but most namely they which inhabited that part of Affrike whiche is ouer agaynst Italy and nere the Italyan see these most increased in welth and honour.
For the Lybiens were nat so good men of warre as the Getulians or Numydyans.
And so all the inward part of Affrike was for the most part in possession of the Numidyans and so moche dyd they: that all the nacions of them subdued were called Numidyans after the name of ouercomers.
Nowe haue we declared howe the Getulians and Lybia~s were first inhabitau~tes of Affrike: and howe the Perseans Medeans and Armenyens came afterwarde and ioyned with them.
And the Medeans and Armenyens by corrupcion of langage were called Mauriens.
¶And nowe co~sequently shall declare what other people came afterwarde and inhabited the same lande of Affrike.
After all these nacions before rehersed: out of ye land of Phenyce came moche people to inhabite themselfe in Affrike.
Some bycause their owne countrey was nat sufficient to sustayne so great a multitude as were of them.
And other some great men of byrth desyrous of lordshyp raysed vp assembled the nedy co~men people left their owne cou~trey: in hope to fynd some other greater dominion els where and in {pro}cesse of tyme aryued at ye lande of Affrike: and there buylded thre cities vpon the see coost named Hippona Adrumentum and Leptis: with other dyuers cities: but nat so great famous as these were.
These cities in short tyme were so augme~ted increased that some of them were honour and some socoure ayde to their originall cou~treis.
But of the cite of Carthage which also by them was buylded and afterwarde became the heed cite of Affrike: me thynke it is better to passe ouer wt scilence: than of it to speke a lytell than to leue the mater in the myddes vnparfet also this my busynes {pro}cedeth to an other purpose.
Neuerthelesse somwhat shall touche the first foun+dacion of this cite of Carthage nat folowyng myne authour Salust: which wryteth nothynge therof: but folowynge the opinion of Vergil as he wryteth in the first boke of Eneas.
¶The quene Dydo doughter of Belus kyng of the land of Cypre and wyfe to Sycheus kynge of Phenyce: fledde with her shyppes laded with golde other ryches out of her owne cou~trey: dredyng ye cruelte of her brother Pygmalion: which blynded by couetyse and ambicyon had slayne her husbande Sicheus by treason.
This Dido at last aryued wit her shippes company at the coost of Affricke where rayned a kyng named Hierbas: which moued with beaute of Dido desyred her to wyfe.
But for loue whiche she had to her first husbande Sicheus she wold nat co~sent therto by any meanes: but desy+red to bye of the same kynge Hierbas as moche ground as myght be co~passed about with hyde of a bull.
And after that it was grau~ted she cut the hyde of a bull so small that with the same she co~passed thre myle of grou~de in compasse.
In which space circuite she bylded a cite: which first was named Byr+sa.
After in proces of tyme it was called Tyros: and last of all Carthage vnder whiche name by long continuance so amply it encreased in fame and welth: that it contayned .xxiiii. myles in co~passe.
But whan it was in most excellence it was vtterly distroied by the romains Publius Scipio Affricane that tyme beyng captayne of the romayne army.
Touchynge the foundacion of this famous cite of Carthage somoche haue written more than myne authour Salust.
But nowe wyll returne to myne institute purpose co~cernyng the dy+scripcion of Affrike brefely bryng it to co~clusion.
The valey of whom spake before named in Affrike la~gage Catha+bathmon deuided the cou~trey of Affrike from Egypt on that syde saue that an arme of the see is bytwene the first cite or ha+bitacion of Affrike towarde this valey is called Cyrene.
And nere to the same be other two cites the one named Tolonia ye other Thercon: beyond these thre cities be two quicksa~des bytwene bothe ye sa~des a cite named Leptis.
Beyond this cite of Leptis is a place named of the romains Phylenorum are in englysshe: the auters of two bretherne called Philenis bycause these two brethern suffred the~selfe to be quicke buryed in the same place for the co~men wele of theyr cou~trey: wherof thy story herafter shalbe written at more oportunite.
This place diuideth the dominion of Carthage from Egypt on that syde.
After this place on the syde costes be other cities belongynge to the dominyon of Punike.
All the places from thens forthe to Mauritany or lande of the Mauriens be vnder subieccion of the Numydyans.
But as we rede: the Ge+tulyans haue theyr habitacion beyond the Numidya~s: some in poore lodgys: and some other more vylely without habitacion wandrynge as vagabu~des.
Beyond these Getulyans is the lande of Ethyope: and from thens forthe be cou~treis so brent with feruour of the sonne that they be inhabitable.
But duryng this warre bytwene the romayns and Iugurth: the romains had in theyr possession many townes of Punike and moche of the costes of thempyre of Carthage: and ruled the same by officers vnder them therto assigned.
great part of Numydy and of the Getulyans vnto a flodde named Mu+lucham: was vnder the dominion of Iugurth.
Ouer all the Maurians raygned one kyng named Bocchus: of whome the romayns had no knowlege saue of his name onely.
And before this batayle: he was nother in peace nor in warre acquaynted nor knowen of the romayns.
Of Affrike of thinhabitau~tes of the same: ynough is spoken and as moche as is requysite of necessite to the processe of this hystory.
Nowe wyll make regression and prosecute my first purposed mater insuyng myne authour Salust.
¶How Iugurth inuaded the kyngdome of Adherball yet ones agayn: and how Adherball agayne was ouercome in batayle: put to flyght.
AFter the embassadours of Rome: of whome haue spoken before: had diuided the realme of Numidy bytwene Adherball Iugurth and were departed out of Affrike towarde Rome: anone Iugurth reuoulued in mynde howe he had escaped vnpunisshed for his crueltie otherwyse tha~ his mynde feared before: And how in stede of punysshement: for his syn~e: he was rewarded with ye better part of the lande of Numidy.
Nowe he consydred that all was true whiche his frendes had tolde hym before whyle he was in Hispayne with the romayne army in the warre of Numance: that is to say.
That nothynge was so false iniust: but that myght be iustifyed at Rome for money for all thyng myght be bought therefor money.
This consideracion inhaunced his mynde vnto esperance that nat a lytell.
Forthermore he was inflamed with the large promesses of them: whome he had acloyed before with gyftes rewardes at Rome: In somoche that agayne of newe he fixed his mynde to inuade vsurpe the kyngdome of Adherball and by some poynt of prodicion to take hym in trap as he had done Hiempsall his brother.
This Iugurth was fiers sharpe apte to warr well inured with thesame expert i~ feates therof: but co~trarely Adherbal: whome he assayled pursued: was a mete man oportune to take iniury more ferefull and dredyng other than to be drad of other.
Wherfore sodenly and without any prouision on party of Adherball: Iugurth inuaded the marches of his kyngdome with a great power multitude of men of armes many of thinhabitantes he murdred and many toke he prisoners with beestes all other maner of prayes robbyng and spoyling euery where: as ferre as his army dis{per}sed townes castels and other edifyces he brent beat downe: and many other places he assayled and inuaded more inwardly in the cou~trey by excourses of his horsemen.
This done he returned into his countrey with all his multitude prayes prisoners: supposynge that Adherball moued with angre displeasure wold reuenge these iniuries and that thyng shulde be cause occasion of open warre bytwene them.
But Adherball aduised hymselfe well: by remembraunce of his first batayle had with Iugurth that he was nat able to contende with hym in batayle nor with force of armes: and more ouer he had more co~fidence trust in frendshyp of the Romayns than in the inconsta~t Numidyans which leaned more to his ennemy than to hym.
These thynges consydred: he send embassadours to Iugurth to complayne of these iniuries: But these embassadours had nought els of hym but contumelious proude and hasty wordes.
And so dispised of Iugurth returned agayn to theyr lord Adherball: though suche answers myght haue moued any coragious hert: neuerthelesse Adherball determined in mynde: to suffre all thynges and to take many iniuries pa+ciently: rather than agayn to begyn batayle with Iugurth.
For (as sayd is) the batayle foughten before bytwene them was bothe to dishonour also great dammage.
But for all this suffrance of Adherball: the mynde of Iugurth was nat more pacified nor lessed of his cruelte.
The pacience of Adherball abated nat the Ire of Iugurth: but it augme~ted: For all redy he had co~cluded in mynde to inuade ye hole kyngdo~e of Numidy.
Therfore he began agayn of newe: nat as before with a co~pany of reuers but with a myghty and great army assembled togyder demeanyng open warre and chalangyng openly the hole empire of Numidy and with such power pro+ceded into the land of Adherball: wastyng the townes fyld{is} on euery syde dryuing away prayes of catell other riches: and increasyng corage to his men and drede to his ennemis.
Whan Adherball sawe it was come to that point that he must nedes other abandon and gyue ouer his kyngdome or els mayntayne it with force of armes as he which was constrayned by extreme necessite: he assembled empareyled an army aswell as he myght and with thesame proceded forth to mete Iugurth.
At last the two hoostes of Adherball of Iugurth approched rested nere togyder besyde a towne named Cirtha nat ferre distant from the seecoost and for asmoch as the day drewe nere to nyght: the batayle was nat anone begon: but eyther party remayned in theyr tentes.
Anone after moch of the nyght was ouerpassed and the starre lyght somwhat dymmed wt obscurite of cloud{is}.
The soudiours of Iugurth raysed by the sounde of tru~pettes vnwarly sodenly inuaded and assayled the tentes felde of Adherball: some they murdred halfe slepynge: some other they flewe whyle they were in hande to arme themselfe.
On part of Adherball was petefull murdre: and on syde of Iugurth no mercy but abstinat persecucion vengeau~ce: and so fiersly fought Iugurth and his co~pany that shortly Adherbal fled to the towne of Cirtha aco~panyed with a fewe horsmen.
But Iugurth pursued hym so nerely that if the inhabitantes of the towne of Cirtha in hast with great multitude had nat receyued Adherball and with force of armes defended the walles kept forth the soudyours of Iugurth whiche persued Adherball: the batayle bytwene them both shuld haue begon ended that one same day and that to destruction of Adherball.
But Iugurth perceyuyng the entre into the towne denyed to hym anone beseged it on euery syde with all maner ingynes inuasyue to his ennemies and defensyue to his company: he caused hastely to be framed large pauayses and towres of tymbre to be dryuen vpon whelis toward the walles of the towne.
And with these and all maner other ingynes went in hande fiersly to assayle the towne: and somoch more hastely he sped hym to thinte~t to bryng his purpose to effect before any embassadors shuld co~e from Rome to resyst his enterprise.
For asmoche as before this batayle he had herd that Adherball had sende embassadours to Rome to certify the senators of his miserable state.
¶Howe the fauourers of Iugurth at Rome laboured so in his cause that thre yong men inexpert and wtout policy were send embassadors into Affrike to cesse this stryfe bytwene the two kynges: and howe these embassadours retourned to Rome without any thyng done ¶The .xiiii. chapter.
BVt after the senatours at Rome herd tidynges of this batayle they send into Affrike thre yonge gentylmen in embassade co~maundyng them to go to bothe the kynges to commaund them in behalfe of the senatours and of the hole people of Rome to cesse theyr warre and to shewe them that the senate and Romayns wylled and vtterly commaunded them so to do.
And so doyng they shuld do as it semed them: and as of co~gruence they ought to do both for pleasure of the Romayns for theyr owne honour profet.
The embassadours with suche co~maundement hasted them and came vnto Affrike the senatours had commaunded them to make somoche more expedicion in theyr iourney bycause tydyng{is} were brought to Rome whan these embassadours prepared themselfe forward: how the batayle was done bytwene Adherball Iugurth and how Iugurth kept Adherball beseged straytly within the towne of Cirtha.
But this rumour was somwhat alayed kept secrete by fauourers of Iugurth after these embassadors were come to Numidy: they expressed to Iugurth theffect of theyr embassade in forme as the senatours had co~maunded them.
Whan Iugurth vnderstode the pleasur of the senatours by theyr wordes embassade: he answered benignely sayeng that he counted no erthly thyng more great nor excellent nor more dere vnto hym than the au+thorite of the senatours people of Rome and that from his yougth to that tyme he had euer so indeuored to order hymself that euery good worshypfull man co~mended alowed hym for his vertu manhode and nat for malyce nor mysdemeanour.
And for the same manlynes nat for malicious dedes nor for disordred maners his co~pany and conuersacion was accept and pleasour vnto the ryght hygh worthy captayne Publius Scipio.
Moreouer: for the same co~uersacion and good maners nat for faute of chyldren naturall his vncle Micipsa had adopted hym for his son~e: and made hym inheritour of his kyngdome partiner wt his owne naturall sonnes: and for asmoch as he had demeaned hymselfe ryght well and worthely in executynge of many hygh glorious interprises: somoch the lesse coude he suffre iniury done vnto hym vnreuenged.
As touchyng Adherball Iugurth alleged for hymselfe that this Adherball by gyle treason lay in wayt to slee hym: which thyng perceyued: he made resystence agaynst the same to the best of his power as any man was bounde to do for sauegard of his owne lyfe.
And if the romayns wolde prohybit deny that vnto hym whiche Iustice permytted to euery man (that is with violence to resyst repell violence) than shulde they neyther do well nor ryght wysely in that behalfe.
Whan Iugurth had answered the embassadours after this maner: than sayd he for conclusion that shortly after he wold send embassadours to certify the senatours of all other thynges co~cernyng this busynes: and on this poynt Iugurth and the embassadours departed in sonder.
Thus Adherball pages missing] had no confort nor lycence to reply agaynst the wordes of Iu+gurth nor syght or co~municacion with the embassadours: all onely was it graunted vnto hym to appelle to ye court of Rome for of these embassadours coude he haue no iustice nor dyreccion in his iniuries and persecucion.
Whan Iugurth thought that thembassadours were passed forth of Affrike toward Rome and whan he sawe yt with force of armes he coud nat wynne the towne of Cirtha bycause of naturall sytuacion difficulte of the place.
Anone he besiged the towne agayn of newe and all difficultes nat withsta~dyng he made a profounde depe trench rounde about the towne with sharpe stakes payles stycked on hyghest part of the same trenches with sharpe pykes on their vpper end{is}.
This dyde Iugurth for many co~syderacions: first to thintent that the inhabita~tes shuld nat breke forth of the towne sodenly at any syde vpon any part of his soudyours whiche besiged them.
Secondly to thintent yt on no part any vitayles shulde be brought into them.
Thirdly that the men of warre within the towne shuld nat thrust forth without ye towne the multitude of poore commens in tyme of famyne scarcite of vitayls.
And fourthly: that no socours shuld entre into them to rescue the towne nor to supply theyr garyson.
Whan this trenche was made fynisshed Iugurth moreouer made strong bulwarkes towres of tymber without the towne strengthed the same with garyson of wyght bolde men of armes.
Bysyde all these ordinau~ces he left nothynge vnassayed nother spared he to atte~pt euery thyng by strength nor by treason gyle.
Somtyme he proued ye watchmen defenders of ye walles with gyftes excityng them to betray the towne.
Whan his rewardes auayled nought than he thretned them with fiers sharpe wordes: he inhaunced by exortacions the mynd{is} courages of his owne men to manlynes audacite.
And so he aplyed his busynesse that nothyng he omytted wont or possible to be done in such a case nor no ingyne of warre laft he vnprouided which i~ those dayes was co~triued or found but rather besyde all old inuen+cyons he ymagined deuysed newe ingynes ordinau~ces of warre nat sene before that tyme and all for distruccion of the towne of Cirtha and of Adherball whome he besyged within the same.
But what tyme Adherball consydred his fortune come to extremite on all part{is} he kest many thyng{is} in mynde.
On the one syde he perceyued his ennemy Iugurth violent agaynst hym and no trust of co~fort of socours.
On the other syde he co~sydred well that for penury want of soudyours other thynges necessary he was nat able nother to fyght with his ennemy nor to dryue forth or prolong the batayle: and for faute of vytayle he myght nat long defende the towne.
These thynges with many mo well reuoulued in mynde he chose forthe two which were most diligent and trusty of that company which had fled with hym into Cirtha.
To them he wofully be wayled his misfortune: and made so large promysses of rewardes vnto them: that at last he induced them to go forthe of the towne by nyght priuely and if they myght escape theyr ennemis to resort to the next hauyn towne: and from thens to hast them to Rome with letters whiche he had deuised and written to be delyuerd to the senators.
These messangers were trusty faythfull within fewe dayes without any dysturbance: they fulfylled the commaundement of theyr soueraygne and delyuerd the letters of Adherball vnto the senatours.
Which letters anone were redde in the counselhous before the senatours and rulers of Rome: of which letters the sentence hereafter insueth and was suche.
¶The sente~ce of the letters sent from Adherball vnto the senatours of Rome: what tyme he lay beseged by Iugurth within the towne of Cirtha.
MOost worthy fathers it is nat througth my faute that sende so often to you requi+ryng your socours and co~playnyng myne iniuryes: but the violence rygour of Iugurth co~pelleth me therto.
Whose mynde is fylled with so great a lust and desyre to beraue my lyfe: yt neyther hath he in mynde the drede of goddes punysshme~t nor fear of your displeasur.
My blode he coueyteth more than all thynges: In somoche that nowe is the .v. moneth sith am kept closed besiged wt armed men by tyranny of Iugurth.
He nothyng regardyng that am co~federate felowe frende of the people of Rome.
Neyther can preuayle nor helpe ye great benefites of my fader Micipsa done to this Iugurth nor your authorite nor ordynaunces or decrees.
am vncertayn whyther am constraned oppressed more greuously by force of armes or by hunger for bothe inuolueth me on all sydes wolde write vnto you moch more touchyng the tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth but my miserable fortune moueth me co~trary: and moreouer haue often {per}ceyued before this tyme: that small credence is gyuen to such as ar oppressed with misery: Saue this per+ceyue clerely that the mynde of Iugurth coueyteth greater thyng than my deth or kyngdome.
And if by your sufferance: he shall subdue me and beraue me kyngdom at last he shall ryse and rebell agaynst your empyre.
Wherfore if ye lyst nat to defende socour my lyfe: at leest: defende your kyngdome of Numidy and preuent the vsurper of your empire.
Suffre nat this tyran to enioye the kyngdome of Numidy and your good wyll withal.
But truely ye may well perceyue that he loketh nat after your fauour after he shal haue vsurped the realme of Numidy.
But whyder he setteth lesse by losse of your frenshyp and fauour or of the dominion of Numidy: none is so blynde but that may euidently perceyue the trouth.
For his dedes declare: that he counteth lesse greuous to haue your hygh displeasur than to lose his fiers purpose to fle me and than to ocupy the hole lande of Numidy.
For this hath he proued and made manifest by his vnnaturall and cruell dedes: first of all he hath slayne my brother Hiempsall: which dede he durst nat haue done if he had feared your displeasur: next that: he droue me forth of my cou~trey and fathers kyngdome.
But these iniuries for certayne were done agaynst my brother and me and nothyng they longed to you.
But nowe he conspyreth hyer inuadyng vsurpyng and wastyng the hole lande of Numidy with force of armes.
And where as ye set me as your lewtenant vnder you to gouerne a part of Nu+midy.
This Iugurth nowe hath dryuen me from my liberte into the towne of Cirtha and besegeth me with men of armes closed on all sydes with outwarde drede and inward famine: So that my peryls may playnly declare how lytell he setteth by the wordes of your embassadours.
Certaynly can se nothyng remaynyng able to remoue his violence nor that can socour this my misery saue onely your power and violence.
wolde ryght gladly: that these thynges whiche nowe write to you and all those thyng{is} which haue complayned before in the counselhouse were but fayned false rather than this my euident misery shulde proue them true credible vnto you.
But sith was borne in that hour and my desteny is such that Iugurth moost manifest his cursed cruelte by me therfore now my request nor prayer is nat that may escape the sharpnes and cruelte of miserable deth whiche beholde instant and ineuitable but onely my prayer is that may escape the long subieccion and bondage of my ennemy: and prolonged tourment{is} of my miserable body.
But worthy fathers: touchyng the kyndome of Numidy which apertayneth to you: prouide you for the same as it lyketh you and if it be your pleasure: ryd and delyuer me from the cruell vnmercyfull handes of Iugurth my mortall enmy for the honour and mageste of your empyre and for the fidelite of all frenshyp yf any remembraunce of my grandfather Massinissa remayneth yet among you.
¶Howe the senatours se~de newe embassadours to Iugurth commaundynge him to desyst from {per}secucion of Adherball: and howe they preuayled nothyng: how the towne of Cyrtha was yelded to Iugurth: and howe he slewe Adherball.
AFter these foresayde letters were openly red recyted before ye senators: many of them wer which cou~sayled to send an army into Affrike in all hast co~uenient to socour helpe Adherball.
And in ye meane tyme they wold take counsell aduise touching Iugurth what shuld be done to hym: bycause he had nat obeyed theyr embassadors.
Whan the fauourers of Iugurth herd of this they laboured withall theyr myght: that no such decre shulde be made nor {pro}cede to effect.
And thus ye co~men wele was ouercome subdued by pryuate profet parciall fauour: as in many other busynesses is dayly wont to happen.
Nat withstandyng this parcialite: at last it was so determined: that other new embassadors wer sent yet ones agayn into Affrike nat yong men inexpert as before: but well aged men of grauite and discression whiche were of great dignite: had borne great worshypfull offices i~ tyme past in the cite of Rome.
Amonge which embassadours was one named Marcus Emilius Scaurus of whome we haue made mencion before.
This Scaurus was a man by riches fame cou~ted able to be cou~sellour of Rome: and also at that tyme a myghty prince great doer among the senators in maner ruler of them all.
For asmoch as all men for the moost part were displeased wt Iugurth sore murmured agaynst his cruelte agaynst ye parciall fauour shewed to hym at Rome: also for that ye messa~gers of Iugurth besought the embassadors to hast them to Numidy therfore ye third day after theyr co~mission they de{per}ted from Italy toke shyppyng in short tyme after aryued in Affrike at a cite named Vtica in a prouince subiect to the romains.
Assone as they were aryued they sende letters vnto Iugurth chargyng hym in all hast to co~me to the sayd prouince to knowe the pleasure of the senatours of Rome whiche had sende them thyder for the nonys with certen commaundementes dyrect vnto hym. of al theyr counsels busynesses.
And howbeit at begynnyng this same Scaurus strongly resisted the party of Iugurth: what tyme many other of his sect were corrupt and accloyed wt bribes long before this: neuertheles now at last his mynde was abstract lyke other mo from the defence of goodnes and honesty vnto his olde vice of insaciable execrable couetyse by meane of habundance of gold and great rewardes of Iugurth.
But at first begynnyng this Iugurth redemed of Cal+phurnius but onely delayng and deferryng of the warre: tru+styng that in meane tyme he shuld brynge about somwhat of his purpose at Rome other by price prayer or fauour.
But nowe after he had won Scaurus to be partiner of his busynes and fauourer of his cause also with Calphurnius: he was brought into a very great trust fully to recouer his peace at Rome: and concluded whyle both Calphurnius Scaurus were there present togyder to take aduiseme~t treat prese~tly with them of all apoyntme~t thyng{is} necessary to be done for {per}fourmyng of his purpose.
Howbeit he trusted nat Calphur+nius so moche that he wolde come to his army except some hostag{is} of the Romayns were left within some strong towne of his: in warde of his people wherby he myght trust without da~mage sauely to be remitted agayn to his army.
Calphurnius to auoyd this dougth of Iugurth to put hym in more assurance send the treasourer of the Romayne army na+med Sextius vnto one of the chefe townes belongyng to Iu+gurth called Vacca faynyng amonge the army that he sent the sayd treasourer thyther for prouision of whete other vitayls necessary to his hoost.
And the same co~maundement to prouyde vitayls the captayn Calphurnius gaue to his treasourer openly in co~men audience: to thinte~t that no man shuld suspect his false purpose: sayeng to his treasourer that hym neded nat to be in dout of Iugurth for asmoch as trues were taken bytwene bothe parties tyll a certayn day prefixed.
The treasourer Sextius went to the sayd cyte of Vacca at commau~dement of Calphurnius his captayne.
Wherfore anone after Iugurth (lyke as he apoynted before) came to the army of Calphurnius and there in presence of the rulers counsell of the Romains spake a lytell of his purgacion concernyng the displeasure enuy hatredde whiche the senate and commens of Rome had taken agaynst hym for his dedes: sayeng that he had nought done but prouoked of his ennemies and for his owne defence: with violence to resyst violence.
Howe beit he sayd that he was co~tented to yelde submit hym selfe vnto the Romayns clemence and mercy.
Somoch spoke he openly before all the chefe cou~sell of the army.
But all the remenaunt he concluded and dyd secretly with Calphurnius Scaurus at more leasoure and thus ended ye co~municacion of this day.
On the next day after insuynge the captayne and the counsell of the army also Iugurth assembled togyder agayn to common of the same mater concernyng peace to be grau~ted to Iugurth.
Nowe was it so that at Rome was decreed an ordinaunce long before this tyme named among the romayns the Satyre lawe whiche lawe co~maunded that the captayne of euery army shulde aske aduyse of all the wyse counsell of his hoost whan he went about any weythy mater co~cernyng the co~men wele.
Wherfore Colphurnius thought so to order hymselfe that he shulde nat be counted a brecare of this lawe: And desyred counsell aduise of all the noble and wyse men of his hoost.
This dyd he to thynte~t that if the peace grau~ted to Iugurth shulde be afterward dysalowed at Rome (as it was) he myght auoyde the faute from hymselfe into the co~mon cou~sell.
But at co~clusion whan Calphurnius acordyng to the sayd lawe had requyred aduyse of the common cou~sell: euery man co~sented that peace shulde be graunted to Iugurth: vpon co~dicion co~uenaunt that he shulde delyuer vnto the romayns thertie Elyphantes with moche other catell and many horses with a great somme of golde.
To which ordinaunce Iugurth acorded and soone after delyuered the same Elyphantes catell and horses golde vnto the tresourer of the Romayne hoost.
This done ye consull Calphurnius departed to Rome to requyre the senatours other rulers to co~ferme this peace co~corde which they had made with Iugurth.
In meane tyme ouer all Numydy and also in the Romayne army was peace and co~corde in abydyng the answere of the senate and rulers at Rome.
¶Howe the rulers of Rome for the moost parte were greuously displeased for grauntyng of and disalowed the same.
And how Memmius inflamed the co~men people agaynst the fauourers of Iugurth.
BVt after it was knowen at Rhome in what maner the consull had behaued hymselfe in Affrike with Iugurth: in euery place about Rome and among euery company within Rome it was co~myned of the dede of Calphurnius.
In somoche that among the co~menty was raysed greuous hatered displeasure agaynst hym.
The senators were sore troubled were in doute whyther they myght co~ferme and alowe this foule and shamefull dede of the consull or els abrogate and annull the same.
In this perplexite they were longe tyme vncertayne: And moost of all the myght and power of Scau+rus (bycause he was a doer and felowe with the consull in the sayd dede) let them frome discussyng of the ryght.
But whyle the senatours in suche wyse prolonged the tyme.
In this dubitacion Memmius (of whose condicions promptnes of wytte and hatered: whiche he had agaynst the power of the estates and noble men we haue written before) at dyuers tymes he assembled the co~mon people exhortyng inflamyng them to reuenge the cruelte of Iugurth and parcialite of his fauourers warnyng them nat to forsake the defence of their co~men wayle and libertie of theyr cite.
He rehersed vnto them the pride the cruelte manyfolde vnlawfull dedes of the senatours of other estates at many tymes done to disworshyp and oppression of the co~men wele.
And vtterly at conclusion so he behaued hymselfe that he kyndled the myndes of the vni+uersall co~mentie to resyst the parcialyte of the estates and to se the cruelte of Iugurth extremely punysshed.
But bycause the eloquence of this Memmius at that season was at Rome notable and moche set by dyscrete of great authorite: haue intended of so many exhortacions as he had to the people: to co~myt one to remembraunce by writynge: And specially be+fore all other wyll write that exhortacion which after returnyng of Calphurnius from Affrike the sayd Me~mius spake before the co~men people in fourme folowynge.
¶The orison of Memmius had before the commen people of Rome.
In whiche orison he induceth them to defe~de their lyberte: And to represse and persecute with hatered the noble men of Rome.
RIght worthy cetyzins many thyng{is} shulde withdrawe me from defence of you and from charge medlyng with your busynesses were nat the great loue fauour which haue to the commen wele: that causeth me to sette a syde all suche impedimentes and vtterly to take vpon me the defence of your lyberte agaynst these corrupt estates.
More playnly to ascertayne you: the thynges whiche myght withdrawe me from defence of your cause be these.
First the power of them which are begy~ners of this variau~ce: that is to say of Calphurnius and Scaurus.
Secondly your pacie~ce which is easy to be subdued of crueltie: sith ye be disposed to endure this wronge.
And thyrdly the infeccion of Iustice whiche is no where here among vs but clene eryled from oure
And principally this letteth me for that se you so innocent so feble mynded and so symple that in euery place ye ar sure of all the peryll of all the laboure and of all the payne: but these estates whiche do nought that is co~mendable haue all the honour auantage and worshyppe.
And sothely: it greueth me to speke to you of the iniury that now of late hath ben done to you: howe moche ye haue ben had in skorne derision and in dysdayne: to the power and pride of a fewe estates.
And also it greueth to recount howe vnreuenged many of your defenders by them haue shamefully ben put to deth for your sake within these fyftene yeres.
And to se howe your myndes be corrupt with cowardyse and negligence that ye wolde neuer socoure them whiche in your quarell and defence haue subdued themselfe to deth.
What intende ye? wyll ye styl be subgette vnto these estates your ennemyes.
It is surely tyme at the last to aryse and defende your lybertie ye do drede them: whome it semeth to dout and to drede you consyderyng your true querell and theyr vngoodly mysdemeanour.
But nat withstandyng that ye be thus disposed to lose your libertie in mysery to passe forthe ye resydue of your lyues neuertheles the good wyll whiche haue to you and to the commen wele causeth and dryueth my mynde to resyst this fals fauoure and parcialyte of these proude and vniuste lordes.
Certesse shall assay and proue howe can defende the libertie whiche my father left me: but whyther shall so do to auauntage or elles in vayne that lyeth hole in your handes and power.
Su+rely worthy citezins do nat exhort you to withstande these wronges and oppressions with force of armes as our forefathers haue often done.
To resyst and repell this wronge nedeth no violence no deuydynge of you from the senatours as your elders haue done before tyme.
It must ned{is} be that these great men co~federat in malyce at last shall come to decay by theyr owne condicions and insolent behauour.
¶Were nat sharpe inquisicions and greuous examinacions had agaynst the co~men people of Rome after that Tiberius Graccus was slayne for the defence of the lawes belongynge to the commentie: whome his euyl wylles accused as vsurper of kyngdome ouer the commen people.
And moreouer after that Caius Graccus and Marcus Fuluius were put to deth for defendyng of your lyberte were nat many of your order and behauoure that is to say of the commentie put to deth or murdred in prison: And at bothe the seasons the estates made none ende of theyr crueltie agaynst you after the lawe but after theyr immoderate pleasure.
Well forsothe graunt that it be reputed for treason and vsurpacion of a kyngdome to defende the lawes and the ryght of the commentie: and graunt also that what thyng can nat be co~dygnely punysshed without effusyon of blode of many citezins: that the same pu+nisshement be executed accordynge to lawe and ryght vpon a fewe suche as were begynners of the trespasse.
Within these fewe yeres passed ye dysdayned murmured secretly among your selfe that the sayd lordes spoyled the commen treasoure without your consent: And that kynges and nacions contrybutory to Rome payed theyr trybutes to a fewe priuate estates and nat generall to the vniuersall cite in commen: and ye grutched that these estates hadde all the most dignite and all the rychesse treasoure also in theyr handes.
Neuerthelesse they cou~ted but a small thyng to escape vnpunysshed for these so great offences.
Wherfore now are they become so bolde so fiers and proude: by your sufferance that at last they haue betrayed and put in handes of your ennemies your lawes your dignite your mageste withall other thynges bothe humayne and diuine to your libertie belongynge.
So that in pardonyng of these inhumayne cruell offences of Iugurth they haue polluted betrayed the lawes bothe of god man.
And how beit that such is theyr demeanour it nothyng repen+teth them: nor they be nought asshamedde therof.
But dayly iette before your faces solemly and pompously bostyng them selfe: Some of theyr dignities theyr lordshyppes and offices.
And other some crakyng of theyr triumphes and victories as who sayeth that they attayned the same by honoure and nat by falsehodde and robberie.
Haue ye nat dayly experience seyng that symple bondmen bought solde for money wyll nat suffre nor endure the vniust commaundementes of theyr lordes or maisters.
But co~trarywyse ye gentylmen: fre+borne cetezyns ar contented to suffre with meke myndes this bondage wherin ye are holden subgette by the power of these lordes.
But pray you what maner of men be these whiche thus subdue you and presume thus longe to occupy the commen wayle at this season? Forsothe they be men most vicious with bloddy handes infected with the blode of innocentes.
Men of immoderate and couetyse: noysom greuous to euery god man.
Whose pride incredyble no man can comprehende which for money haue solde and dayly are redy for to sell for lucre: theyr fidelite theyr worshyppe theyr deuocyon and good name: And brefely all thynges honest dishonest are they redy to do for auantage.
Wherby it apereth euidently that all theyr ioye felicite resteth in couetyse.
Some of them count themselfe more assured bycause they haue slayne the protectours of the commentie to the intent that other may drede them so moche more: And other some of them in wrong examinacions inquisions had agaynst you reioyse and count them selfe hardye surer therby: And many other thynketh theyr defence and auauncement in murdring of you bostyng them selfe of the same: and thus howe moche wors that eche of them doth: the more sure he is more sette by.
In somoch that where they ought to fere you for theyr mysdedes: they transpose that feare vnto you and cause you by your cowardyse to feare and drede them: whiche are conioyned all togyder agaynst you i~ one maner desyre of yll in one maner couetyse in one hateredde of good and in one maner fere of your auau~ceme~t: but among good men to be all of one mynd vnder this maner one nat withstandynge an other it is to be counted for amyte and frendshyppe.
Amonge yll men suche agreyng of maners is but a knotte of discorde and causeth sedycion variau~ce and debate.
But verily if ye had so great desyre and care to recouer your lyberte (which is lost) as they haue to encrease theyr lordshyppe: than shulde nat the co~men+wele be oppressed and wasted as it is nowe: and than shulde the offices maistershyppes and dignitees of Rome (whiche ar your benefites to gyue where lyketh you) be in the handes of good vertuous men and nat in the ha~des of bold bosters and iniust men confederate in myschefe.
The co~mentie of Ro+me your forefathers before this tyme haue armed themselfe and forsaken the senators two sondry tymes kepe themselfe togyder vpon the hyll of Aduentyne onely bycause the wold haue a lawe decreed inacted for them: And maisters or officers elect for them which shulde be theyr protectours agaynst the iniury and extorcion of the estates whan nede shulde requyre whiche thyng at last was graunted to them and many other lyberties also.
Than shulde nat ye laboure moche more withall your myght for conseruacion of the same lyberties whiche they haue left vnto you as hole as euer they had them: And specially for this cause ought ye to defende your priuileges for that it is more shame and rebuke to lese the priuilege and lybertie goten than neuer to haue optayned them: And specially what shame is it to you nothynge to augment nor encrease that authorite whiche your elders forefathers haue left to you: but to suffre ye same by your cowardyse by lytell and lytell to dekay: and at laste vtterly to be loste and come to nought? But any of you may than requyre of me what is yor mynde what wyll ye that we do? wyll forsothe and cou~sell that punysshment be taken vpon them whiche haue betrayed the honour of the commen wele vnto your ennemy Iugurth without aduyse of the senators or of the co~menty: but this my counsell is nat to punysshe them violently with your power in batayle for certesse that were more dyshonoure vnto you to do than to them to suffre the same.
Nat withstandynge that they be worthy so to be delt withall.
But this thynge may be best done by inquysition examinacion and co~fession of Iugurth hymselfe and by his accusacion of these treatours whiche Iugurth surely wyll be obedient to come hyther to Rome at your co~mau~deme~t if it be true that he hath yelded hymselfe.
But if he dyspice your commaundementes than may ye well thynke and co~syder what peace or yeldynge he hath made by the which yeldyng he is vnpunysshed and pardoned of his de+testable and shamefull dedes and these estates laded with richesse and treasoure.
But curcite and welthe of the co~menty is come to losse dammage and vtter shame and disworshyp· Thus must ye do suche examinacions must ye make without ye thynke that these great men haue nat yet sufficie~t lordshyppe and power in theyr handes or els without ye shewe outwarde that ye were better pleased and content with that season whan kyngdomes prouinces iustices lawes iugementes batayle peace and finally euery thyng bothe diuine and humayne were in handes of a fewe estates.
Than ye be nowe pleased with the season tyme that now is whan your lybertie is gyuen to you whiche ye are able to mayntayne if ye so be disposed.
But in that season passed howe beit ye were vnouercome of your ennemies maisters emperours ouer the most part of the worlde: yet had ye ynough to do to defende your owne lyfe from the cruelty of these fewe mighty men.
For of you all who was so bolde to withsta~de their subieccion bo~dage.
Wherfore if ye entend to endure suffre the destru+ction of your libertie as ye begyn tha~ truely ye tyme which is to come shalbe moch more cruell to you than the tyme passed.
But as for me nat withsta~dyng that vnderstand the great offence and abhominable of this wycked Iugurth is suffred vnpunysshed: yet wolde suffre paciently that ye shulde forgyue pardon the wicked doers of this dede men most vngra+cious bycause they be citezins.
If it were nat so that such mer+cy and forgyuenes shuld tourne to our dystruction ruyne of our empire.
For ye may se howe great oportunite and sufferance they haue in somoche that they count but a small thyng to do vnhappely without punysshment.
Wherfore they nowe dayly encrease theyr cruelty agaynst you if ye do nat herafter take from them the power authorite therof.
And specially co~tynuall busynes without ende shall remayne vnto you wha~ ye se playnly that outher ye must be seruau~tes or bondemen: or els ye must retaygne and defende your libertie by strength of your handes.
For what hope or trust is there of faithfulnes or of concorde bytwene you and them· None surely.
For their mynde is vtterly set to be lordes ouer you: and ye on the other part wyll nedes be fre and at liberte.
They be extremely incli+ned and disposed to do wrong and iniury vnto you.
And brefely to speke they take the frendes and felowes of our empire for ennemies.
But our mortall ennemies they take for theyr felowes frendes.
Wherfore can ye suppose that peace loue or frendshyppe can be among people so co~trary of myndes disposicion.
For these co~syderacio~s warne exhort you that ye suffre nat so great myschefe to escape vnpunysshed.
This offence is nothynge lyke to the robbyng of the co~mon treasour nor to ye spoylyng of money by extorcion fro~ the felowes frend{is} of our empire.
Which dedes (howbeit they be greuous in maner intollera+ble) neuertheles by custo~e vse of the same they ar reputed for small fautes for nought.
But this dede is moche more greuous and vtterly intollerable.
For the authorite of the senate is betrayed to our most cruell and fiers ennemy Iugurth your empire is falsly betrayed to other mennes handes and possession.
The co~men wele hath ben put to sale to Iugurth by ye senators bothe at home in our cite and also in our army by Calphurnius the co~sull: Insomoch that if examinacion be nat made herof: and if they be nat punysshed which be culpable fautie herin.
What thyng shall remayne vnto vs but that we must passe our lyfe vnder obedience and bondage of them which thus haue done and vs shall they kepe in subiection as yf they were kynges? For what thynge longeth to a kynge saue to parfourme his wyll and pleasur be it good or yll without any resystence or punysshment of any man.
Do nat these estates thus wtout any co~tradiction nat withsta~dyng that it is in your power to withstand the~ if ye wyll.
Nor certes worthy citezins do nat thus exhorte you to coueyt rather that your citezins shulde do yll than well.
But speke to thinte~t that ye shulde nat so fauour forbere a fewe iniust yll disposed men: that the vtter distruction of all good men shuld procede of suche indiscrete fauour: And also namely in a cite or a co~men wayle it is moch better and more tollerable to forgete the rewarde of good dedes than the punysshment of yll ded{is}.
For a good man seynge his goodnes nat rewarded nor set by he dothe but onely withdrawe his owne kyndnes: but an yll man nat punysshed is the more bold cursed: And moreouer if such as be mysdoers be punysshed at the last theyr nombre shalbe abated decresed and if there be fewe vniust men the lesse wrong is done.
And he to whome no wronge is done nedeth nat to call for socour nor helpe.
Thus it is better to leaue a good dede vnrewarded than an yll dede vnpunysshed.
¶Howe Memmius induced the people of Rome by the sayd orison: so that Cassius was sent for Iugurthe to brynge hym to Rome to declare and accuse the supporters of his dedes.
MEmmius cou~sellyng inducynge often tymes by these word{is} and other lyke at last dyde somoch that Lucius Cassius one of the chefe .x. iudges of Rome shuld be sende to Iugurth assure hym of his lyfe and to come retourne in saue garde vpon promes and fayth of all the hole co~menty of Rome.
And vpon this promes to bryng hym to Rome to thin+ten that by his owne wordes and confession of the treuth the falshode couetyse of Calphurnius the consull of Scaurus of other whiche had ben corrupted by hym before by money and rewardes myght be euydently proued knowen.
¶Of the behauour of the soudyours and other whiche were laft in Numidy whyle Scaurus the consull was at Rome.
WHyle these thynges were in hand and done at Rome in meane tyme the chefe of ye soudyours whiche Calphurnius had lefte behynd hym in Numidy folowed the maners and beha+uour of theyr captayne dyde many vngoodly and myscheuous dedes.
Some of them were so corrupt with golde that they delyuerd agayne to Iugurth the olyphantes which he had gyuen to Calphurnius what tyme ye peace was graunted and trues first taken bytwene them.
Some other solde to Iugurth the traytours whiche had fledde from hym vnto the romayns army: And other some spoyled robbed the people of Numidy whiche had all redy peace with the Romayns and had yelded themselfe.
So great shamefull was the violence of couetyse which had infected theyr mynd{is} as if it had ben an vniuersall contagion of pestence.
But nowe wyll returne to my mater where left before concernynge Cassius the iudge and his vyage to Numidy for to bryng Iugurth vnto Rome.
¶Howe Iugurth came to Rome with Cassius and howe he behaued hymselfe there.
CAyus Memmius in name of all the co~mens gaue co~maundeme~t to Cassius (accordynge to the ordinaunce inacted) to spede hym toward Numidy and to bydde Iugurth come to Rome vnder suerte co~dicion before rehersed.
Whan the estates whiche knewe the~selfe culpable vnderstode of this they were maruelusly abassed.
But wham Cassius was come to Iugurth nat withstandyng that he was of his part and had no confidence in his cause for asmoche as he knewe hymselfe fauty in his owne conscience: yet Cassius aduysed hym and induced hym: bycause he had yelded hymselfe to come vnto Rome: without he wolde rather proue the Romayns strength and violence than theyr mercy and pyte: and moreouer the sayd Cassius promised also his owne fayth and trouth that if he wolde come to Rome and answere truly to all suche thynges as there shulde be demaunded of hym he shulde safely go and come without any impediment.
Cassius had so good a name at that tyme that Iugurth had asmoche co~fidence in his fayth promes alone as in the promes or assu+rance of the hole cite.
And so at last Iugurth co~sented to go to Rome with Cassius.
Wherfore to enduce the romayns to the more pyte he arayed hymselfe in rude aparell agaynst his honour royall moche vyle and myserable: and so with Cassius came to Rome nat as a kyng but poorly and with a small co~pany.
And nat withstandyng that his mynde was moche con+fermed assured and bolded: by the confort of them whiche he had corrupted with rewardes before vnder whose defence supportacion he had co~mytted so moche cruelty: yet he behaued hym so with his gyftes of newe assone as he was come to Rome that by his great reward{is} be induced a lorde of Rome named Caius Bebius one of the {pro}tectours of the co~menty to be supporter mayntener of his cause among the other mo· By whose dishonest vnmesurable couetise he trusted assuredly to be defended agaynst lawe from all punysshmentes due vnto his demerites.
But the co~menty of Rome was violently and sore wrathe agaynst Iugurth some co~maunded to haue hym to prison there to kepe hym in bandes: And other some wolde that acordyng to the lawe punysshment of dethe shulde by taken of hym as of theyr mortall ennemy if he wold nat shortly co~fesse discouer the felowes partiners supporters of his cruell dedes.
Caius Me~mius heryng herof called togyder the co~menty and alayed the mocyon wrath of theyr myndes apeasyng theyr vnauysed rancour.
And requirynge them to kepe the fayth trouth of the cite (which they had promysed to Iugurthe) clere inuiolate and vndefyled.
Thus dyd Memmius exhort them as he which more regarded set more by the conseruacion of the dignite of Rome than by the parfourmynge and satisfyeng the wrath ire of the rude co~mens.
But whan sylence was made among all the assemble: anone Iugurth was brought forth before them all.
Memmi{us} than began to speke to hym demurely rehersyng and openly recountyng how he had corrupt the estates of Rome with his treasure and cruelly agaynst ryght had done many abhomynable dedes at Rome and also in Numidy agaynst the kyng Micipsa and his sonnes as slayne Adherball and Hiempsall falsly dysceyued the kyng Micipsa: and wasted ye kyngdome of Numidy.
And howebeit (sayd Memmius) that the Romayns knewe well his supporters yet they wold most of all that Iugurth shulde openly discouer accuse them hymselfe.
Wherfore he desyred hym truely to co~fesse the names of them by whose supportacion he was so bolde to co~myt so many i~mo+derate cruell dedes.
Sayng that if he wold so do co~fesse disclose the trouth than myght he haue great trust and confydence in ye fauour cleme~ce and mercy of the people of Rome.
But if he wold nat so do he shulde do no profet by his sylence to the noble men of Rome which had supported him: And also he shulde be dystruction and vndoyng of hymselfe and of his ryches also.
On this poynt Memmi{us} ceassed his wordes and helde hym styll.
Anone Iugurth was co~mau~ded of the commente to make answere.
But whan he was reddy to haue spo+ken Caius Bebius whome he had corrupted with treasour (as haue made mencion before) commau~ded hym to hold his pease.
In somoche that howebeit the people sore moued with displeasure put hym in feare with exclamacion agaynst hym with angry countenances· and often violently rennynge vpon hym and with other tokens of yre and dyspleasure.
Neuerthelesse for all this the frowarde counsell of Bebius ouercame theyr thretnyng insomoche that Iugurth wolde nothyng speke nor dysclose.
And thus the people had in derision abused departed from the co~gregacion and assemble.
So the myndes of Iugurthe of Calphurnius and of other theyr partyners were than inhansed increased in boldnesse: whiche were troubled and moche ferefull before whan Iugurth was first sende for and brought to be examined.
¶How Iugurth encreased his crueltie at Rome and renued his murdre in sleayng an other noble man of the stocke of Micipsa by occasion wherof he was constrayned to departe from Rome and the batayle renewed agayne of hole.
AT the same season was a gentleman at Rome named Massiua borne of the countrey of Numidy whiche was the son~e of Galussa neuewe to ye good kyng Massinissa.
This Massiua was agaynst Iugurth in the stryfe disce~cion bytwene Adherball hym whan the towne of Cirtha was yelded and Adherball slayne.
Whefore he trusted nat Iugurth but to saue hymselfe fled from Numidy vnto Rome.
Nowe was a lorde at Rome named Albinus whiche was creat consull with an other partyng felowe named Minucius the next yere after Calphurnius.
This Albinus came to Massiua and cou~sayled hym (bycause he was of the stocke of Massinissa) to greue Iugurth asmoch as he coude with enuy feare and displeasure for his offences cruelte: And by peticion to desyre of the senatours the administracion of the kyngdome of Numidy.
Albinus gaue to hym this counsell for asmoch as he hymselfe was desyrous of batayle.
Wherfore he wold moch rather that euery thyng wer moued with trou+ble than pacified or at rest.
Than was a custome at Rome that the consull shulde haue a partyng felow bytwene them the prouinces belongyng to Rome shulde be deuided.
Thus in departyng of the prouinces the cou~trey of Numidy fell to Albinus and the countrey of Macidony to his felowe Minutius.
Shortly after Massiua began to moue the mater to the senatours touchyng administracion of the kyngdome of Numidy.
Iugurth hering of this had nat so great trust i~ his mater nor to his frendes as he had before: For some of them with drewe theyr selfe for knowlege of theyr fautes and other some for feare of yll name and fame or rumour of the people.
Wherfore Iugurth consyderyng this requyred Bomilchar one of his most nere trusty frendes to prouyde and to hyer by gyftes rewardes a co~pany to sle the sayd Massiua and that as priuely as coude be done.
But if it coud nat priuely be done than to slee hym openly by one meane or other Bomilchar shortly went about the co~maundement of Iugurth and anone prouided men suche as were mete for suche a dede: and co~maunded them to espy and serche his wayes his goynges co~myng{is} and to wayet a season place co~uenient to parforme theyr enterprise.
But afterwarde whan he sawe his tyme he prepared to execute this treason.
Wherfore one of them which were ordayned assigned to this murdre assayled Massiua rasshely with small prouisyon or auysement slewe hym vnware.
But he whiche dyde the dede anone was taken brought before the iudges.
The people in great nombre desyred at last co~strayned hym to tell by whose cou~sell he dyd that myscheuous dede and specially Albinus the consull coarted hym therto.
The murderer anone co~fessed the treuthe and declared howe he had done it at the instigacion counsel of Bomilchar: And nat withsta~dyng that the same Bomilchar came to Rome vnder the sauegarde assurance of the fayth of the commente as dyd Iugurth yet he was iudged gyltie of the dede co~sideryng that he was cou~selloure therto and nat accordyng to the common lawe but after very equite and good co~science.
But Iugurth co~syderyng hymselfe culpable in the same faute yet wolde by no meane confesse nor knowlege hymselfe fautie tyll tyme that he vnderstode and sawe that the enuy and displeasure which was taken agaynst this dede passed all his fauoure and rewardes whiche he had gyuen at Rome so yt at last in his gyftes he fou~de no socoures nor ayde.
But howebeit in the first accion or accuseme~t which was layed agaynst hym he had brought in layd .l. suerties of his frendes for hym all other of his retynue that he shuld purge hymselfe of euery thyng which was or shulde be layed agaynst hym yet thought he better to prouide for the proteccion of his kyngdome than for the helth of his pledges or suerties.
And this co~sydring he priuely sent Bomilchar away from Rome vnto Numidy dredynge that if condyng and worthy punysshement were taken of Bomylchar at Rome the other commentie of his realme at home wolde drede to be obedient to hym.
And anone after Bomilchar was departed Iugurth hymselfe fledde also from Rome after hym commaunded of the senatours to depart from Italy as ennemy to the romayns theyr empyre.
But whan he was departed a lytell without Rome: it is sayde that he loked often backewarde behynde hym spekyng secretly to hymselfe but at the last he spake playnly in audience that they whiche were assystent myght here hym and sayd.
noble and famous citie corrupt and accloyed with infect citezins whose couetyse is so insaciable that they wyll profer the forth to sale shortly thou shuldest be solde and perysshe if thy rulers coude fynde any man that wolde bye the and gyue money for the.
¶Howe Albynus consull of Rome renewed the warre agayng Iugurthe and at last returned agayne to Rome leauynge his brother Aulus in Numidy with the army in his rowme.
IN the mean season Albinus whiche was create consull next after Calphurnius renewed the warre agaynst Iugurth and wtout causeth vytayls wag{is} and all other thynges necessary expedie~t and belongynge to soudyours: to be conueyed spedely into Affrike.
And he anone hymselfe in all hast toke his vyage thyderwarde also and so forth to Numidy.
In which vyage he made more hasty expedicion to thintent to fynisshe the warre with Iugurth other by force of armes or els co~strayning hym to yeld hymselfe or by some other meanes what so euer myght be founde namely before the tyme of election of newe consuls whiche tyme was nat longe to come.
But contrary wyse Iugurth prolonged euery thyng by one cause or other.
As fast as Albinus went forwarde so fast Iugurth founde impedimentes somtyme he promysed to yelde hymselfe and somtyme fayned hymselfe afrayed.
One whyle he fled from the army of Albinus whan it was nere hande to hym: And anone after lest his men shuld mystrust by dysconfort or dispayre he boldely withstode and defended hymselfe manly.
And thus in prolongyng the tyme: somtyme with warre and somtyme with peace he abused and mocked the consull wherfore some were which suspected that Albinus was nat ignorant of the counsell of Iugurth but co~sentyng to hym by fauoure: And for asmoche as at the begynnynge he was so fiers hasty and diligent: it was suspected that he droue forth the tyme nowe rather by craft than cowardyse.
But after the tyme was passed and the day of election of newe consules aproched came fast on.
The consull Albinus ordayned his brother named Aulus to remayne in his stede as captayne and ruler in the army: and he hymselfe departed towarde Rome to be at election of the newe consuls as the lawe requyred.
¶How Aulus and the romayne army were disconfyted of Iugurth: and howe peace was grau~+ted to hym by Aulus: and to what shame the Ro+mayns were put by rasshe foly of the same capytayne Aulus.
IN the same season was the commen wayle at Rome moche troubled with variaunce and debate betwene the protectours of the commentie.
For of them one named Lucullus and an other Annius laboured to contynue and kepe styll their offi+ce and agaynst the ordynaunce of the lawe to contynue more than one yere.
Wherfore the other whiche were {per}tyngfelowes i~ office with them laboured with all their myght the contrary to resyst them and to mayntayne the olde constitucion ordynaunce and custome.
This dyscencion and debate letted the election of the newe consuls all that yere.
Aulus whom Albinus had left with the army in Numidy as his lewtenant herd of this prolongyng of the tyme was brought in great hope to wynne great honour or treasour.
Wherfore in the cold moneth of Ianuary he called the soudyours forth of theyr tentes to execute the batayle with Iugurth without more delay.
Outher dyde he thus shortly to make an ende of the batayle in his tyme and therby to wynne honoure or els with his army to put Iugurth in feare (so that to haue peace) he shulde redeme the same of Aulus with great treasoure.
Aulus concludynge on this purpose spedde hym so fast with his soudyours makyng dayly great iournayes (nat withsta~dyng the sharpnesse of wynter) that at last he came to a towne in Numidy named Suthull: in whiche towne the treasours of Iugurth were layed.
This towne with walles waters and mou~taygnes of nature was strongly defended: for without the walles buylded on the heyght of a mountaygne broken on the forefronte was a great playne fenne or marrayse grounde: all ouercouered with mudde and standyng wynter water.
Insomoche that what for the sharpnesse of the wynter season: and what for naturall defence of the place this towne coude by no meanes bewell besyged nor taken: yet this nat wtstandyng Aulus to encrease fere to Iugurth and for the blynde desyre which he had to wynne the towne in maner of dissimulacion assayled the same and made pauayses about the walles of sheldes conioyned lyke vynes wherunder his men myght fyght with lesse dammage or paryll.
Than made he a dyche or trenche rounde about the towne with great hepes of erth casten vpon the sydes of the same to the entent that no socours shulde entre into them nor they escape forth at theyr pleasurs.
And finally he made redy euery thynge whiche belonged or was necessary to besegyng of suche a towne.
But Iugurth anone perceyued the vayne and folysshe behauoure of Aulus and craftely encreased by polycy the madnes of hym sending often embassadours vnto hym to requyre in derysion that he wolde desyst and leue besyginge of the towne and intreatyng hym of peace mekely.
But in the meane tyme Iugurth hymselfe in maner as yf he wold nat intermell with Aulus ledde his army by wodes forestes by streat passages by hyls dales and by bacways: causynge Aulus to suspect that he was a dradde of hym: And finally he enduced Aulus to truste after some apointement.
And thus Iugurth with his men fleyng alway into desertes and hydde places gaue confort to Aulus and encreased his corage by such auoyding.
Insomoch that at last Aulus gaue vp the segyng of the towne of Suthull: And with his hole power hastely pursued Iu+gurth as fleynge from hym for drede into places vnknowen to hym and his men.
Thus was the treason of Iugurth more hydde from Aulus wherfore he made the lesse prouision therfore.
In the meane season Iugurth by subtyll messangers attempted the romayne army day and nyght inducyng them to consent to betray theyr felowes the capytayns and vndercaptayns: anone for lucre consented to hym.
Some in tyme of batayle to forsake and betray theyr owne company and to fyght on the part of Iugurth.
And other whiche wolde nat grau~t to so foule a dede as to fyght agaynst theyr owne company he exhorted and induced them whan the trumpettes shulde blowe to batayle to leue theyr places array: And depart from theyr company without stroke on one syde or other.
Whan euery thynge was brought to his purpose and accorded to his requestes: Than about mydnyght he stale priuely towarde the tentes of the romayns: and sodenly with a great company of Numidyans compassed them about on euery syde and assayled them fiersly.
The romayne soudyours whiche were with Aulus thus vnwarly inuaded: were meruelously abasshed and amased for ye vnwont sodayn feare of this treason.
Some of the most noble hertes: with great courage drewe to them theyr harnes and resysted theyr ennemies valyantly: fully assured and prefyxed to dye lyke men: yf fortune shulde graunt them none other meanes to escape that instant danger.
Some other as cowardes hydde themselfe in caues other secrete places yf they myght any fynde.
The boldest and most vsed to suche chaunces conforted theyr felowes whiche were ferefull and vnexpert of suche chaunces of warre.
Howbeit none of them all was so bolde nor so well assured of hymselfe but that he was bothe in great drede and danger.
And no maruayle for in euery place and on all sydes about them they were inuironed in compasse with great violence plentious nombre of theyr ennemies hyd vnder darknes of the nyght and cloudes which vtterly obscured the sterres lyght.
Theyr paryll was indifere~t and doutfull whyther they fled or abode the batayle.
For deth was instant and depended ouer theyr hedes euery way: and other hope nor esperau~ce was none saue deth ineuitable.
So that finally it was vncertayne vnto them whether it was better ormore sure to fle or to abyde to theyr aue~ture.
But of that company wihich Iugurth had corrupted with rewardes as we haue sayd before one bende or cohort of lombardes and tow turmes that is to say .lx. thraciens and a fewe rude and co~men soudyours betrayed the romayns and went ouer to Iugurth.
Also the Centurion whiche was assigned to be captayne ouer them whiche were co~mytted to fyght about the first standard of the thyrd legion drewe hym and his company asyde and suffred theyr ennemies to entre into the myddes of the hoost on that syde which they had taken to defend.
Thus all ye Numidye~s brake in on that syde without any resystence.
And at conclusion the romayns had a foule flyght and a shamefull disconfiture insomoche that they trusted more to theyr fete than to theyr handes or armour: And many of them to ren lyghter thrue away theyr armour and harnes and toke the top of an hyll whiche was nere therby and ther taryed.
The company of Iugurth what for spoylinge of the romayns tentes and darknes of the nyght had les honour of victorie and suffred many of the romayns to escape.
On the next day after Iugurth and Aulus came to co~munication togyder.
Than sayd Iugurth to Aulus that nat withstandyng that he had hym his army which were letf alyue sure ynough co~passed and enuyroned with wepen hunger so that they coude nat escape hym: and howebeit it was in his power to oppres hym all his.
Neuertheles he remembred well ynough the incertayn chances of mannes busynesse wold nat be to hym cruell nor vncurres so that he wolde make wt hym a bonde of peas and no more contend agaynst hym in batayle on this condicion that all the soudyours of Aulus shulde do obesance vnto hym and passe vnder a spere in token of subiectyon and so without more damage depart out of the countrey of Numidy within the space of .x. dayes next after.
But howbeit this composicion and condicions were hard greuous and full of shame misery: and worthy to be punysshed of the senatours yf Aulus agreed to them.
Neuerthelesse theyr myndes so wauered for drede of deth that at last the composicion agrement was concluded agreed at the wyll pleasure of Iugurth vpon the sayd condicions.
¶what sorowe and heuynes was at Rome: and how they demeaned themselfe in the cite after that tydynges herof were brought thyder.
WHan the Romayns vnderstode of this at Rome all the cite was fylled with drede sorowe lame~tacion mournyng.
Some bewayled the worshyp of as lost by that shamefull co~posicion: And other vncustomed to suche busynesse of batayle: nat knowyng nor co~sydryng the variable mutabilite of chau~ces of wary fered the losse of their libertie of their cite and of all theyr empire.
They all were wrothe vtterly displeased wt Aulus cause of this subiection shamefull co~posicion.
But namely they which had ben good warryours in their dayes were displeased with hym most of all: whan they co~sydred that he beyng armed well apointed to batayle rather sought meanes to escape from deth by suche shamefull bonde co~posicion than manly abyding the of batayle to haue delyuered hymselfe his co~pany: or els valyantly to haue dyed with honoure.
But the co~sull Albinus hymselfe dreded sore for this thyng{is} co~sydring that for his brothers faute in tyme to co~e he shuld nat auoyde the displeasure of the senatours co~mens of Rome.
For as he conie+ctured all his brothers dedes shuld redou~de to his dishonour paryll bycause he had lymitted hym in Numidy in his sted to be captayne of the army in his abse~ce.
Wherfore (these thyn+ges duely aduysed) he went to the senators desyringe them to take counsell aduiseme~t whyther they wolde approbate and allowe the sayd co~posicion bytwene his brother Aulus Iugurth: or els nat.
But he knewe ryght well that the senatours wolde nat co~ferme the same.
Wherfore (in meane tyme whyle they wer cou~selling) he elect soudyors for supplime~t to fulffyll and parforme agayne the army whiche was in Affrike and sore diminisshed.
For many of them were slayne by Iugurth and his company.
Wherfore Albinus raysed vp socours of such as were nere to the costes of Rome and frendes to thempire: as Latinians and Italians with other nacio~s.
Of these he raysed as many as he myght and assembled them togyder by all meanes whiche he coude deuyse to fournysshe and augmente his army.
At conclusion the senatours decreed in their counsell that no bonde of peace nor composicion myght be co~firmed without their consent and without the aduyse commaundement of the co~men people also: as ryght and reason requyred.
And thus was the sayd co~posicion of Aulus abrogate as thyng presumed without consent or co~maundement of the senatours or commens.
But whan the consull Albinus had ordayned and prepared supplement of his army (as sayd is) he was prohybet and letted by the protectours of the co~menty: Insomoche that he was nat suffred by them to conuey suche company as he had raysed into Affrike with hym as he intended to repayre and tornysshe the army whiche there remayned.
Wherfore he spedde hymselfe forth into Affrike disapoynted of his purpose with a small company of men of his owne retynue.
The army of the romayns whiche he before had co~mytted to Aulus his brother: accordyng to the opoyntment with Iugurth was departed forth of Numidy.
And to pasforth the wynter taryed in a prouince of Affrike whiche was subget to thempire of Rome.
Whan Albinus the consull was arryued come thyder: his mynde ardently was kyndled with desyre to pursue: Iugurth and to remedy the yl and displeasure whiche the commens at Rome had agaynst Aulus his brother.
Neuertheles whan he knewe the maners and yll behauour of the soudyours: of whome some were fled treyterously to Iugurth (as is sayd before) some by sufferaunce of theyr captayne were infected and corrupted with ouermoch pleasure dissolute liberty and voluptuous lyuing: this consydring he concluded (as the case requyred) to do nothyng for a season: and to attempte no maistry: but to passe forth the wynter with his army without remouynge or puttyng hymselfe in ieopardy or paryll.
¶In the meane season whyle Albinus and his army soiourned in the {pro}uince of Affrike tyll the wynter were ouerpassed.
At Rome was one named Caius Manlius elect and lymitted proiectour of the co~men people whiche anone after he was in authorite: assembled the co~mens: desyred cou~sayled them that inquisicion myght be made of all such by whose sup+portacion cou~sell Iugurth had dyspised set nought the ordinau~ces decreed of the senatours.
And agaynst them whiche had restored agayne to Iugurth the elyphantes whiche Iugurth had delyuerd to Calphurnius at the first composicion and apoyntment whiche was made with hym.
And also agaynst them whiche had receyued any money or other reward{is} of Iugurth whyle they were embassadors or captains of armies ayenst hym: send forth by the romayns.
And finally the same inquisicion also was extended agaynst all such as had made any pactions apoyntmentes or promises of peace or of warre with ennemies of thempire without generall co~sent of the senatours or commens.
¶Whan this inquire was moued: many of the senatours noble men of Rome knewe themselfe culpable in the forsayd articles.
And other some douted sore of paryls for to come bycause of the ylwyll malyce whiche the partie of the co~mens confederat had agaynst them.
Wherfore syth the same noble men myght nat well resyst the examinacion of these articles openly: but of necessite they must agre therto: other els knowlege themselfe (by their resystence) gylte in the same: therfore they prepared impedime~t priuely agaynst suche inquisicions by theyr frend{is}: but specially by ye felowes of thempire whiche were co~federate with the romayns as Italyans Latinia~s.
The princes of these nacions suche other lyke gaue counsell to the senatours whiche were nat fauty in the premysses and also to the co~menty: that in suche a troublous besy and peryllous season no suche examinacions shulde be made nor procede forwarde to effect: for drede of many inconueniences which of the same myght ryse bytwene the noble men the co~mens.
But (this nat withstandyng) it is a merueylous thyng and in maner incredible to speke of: how besy and diligent the commens were to haue the same inquisicion to procede and to be brought to effect: and that rather for hatered whiche they had agaynst the noble men (agaynst whome the sayd inquisicion was ordayned) tha~ for any good wyll or fauour whiche they had to the co~men wele.
Wherfore whyle the remenant of the noble men were sore troubled with fere and drede.
Marcus Scaurus which was before sent into Affrike with Calphurni{us} (as haue sayd) prouided for hymselfe in crafty maner as shall nowe declare.
Whyle the co~menty was mery ioyeous of this examinacion many of the company of Scaurus that knew themselfe fauty fled for feare.
And the hole cite was in moche drede and Manlius obtayned his peticion wyll of the commenty.
In somoche that anone were ordayned thre noble men co~missioners to examine the thre articles before rehersed and here insuyng of whom the first was of them which counselled Iugurth to dispise the decreis of the senatours and that toke money or rewardes of hym.
The seconde was of them that solde agayn to Iugurth the forsayd elyphantes and the Numidiens that left Iugurth commynge on the romayns syde.
And the thyrde examinacion was of them whiche had made any apointement of peace or warre with the ennemies of Rome as was Iugurth.
But nat withstandynge that Calphurnius was culpable in the same asmoche as any other of the no+ble men.
Neuerthelesse he shyfted so for hymselfe that he was electe to be one of the examinours or commyssioners to make inquisicion of these thre poyntes rehersed.
The inquisicion proceded to effecte and was handled and put in execucion with moche violence and sharpely after the commen rumour and pleasure of the co~menty.
Thus the people seynge theyr pleasure fulfylled at that tyme began to be proude and statly therof in lykewyse as the estates had ben in foretyme of theyr power and lordshyp.
But here wyll make a small dygression fro my purpose tell wherof this variance discord bytwene the co~mens and noble men first proceded. ¶wherof the dyscorde and takyng of parties by+twene the noble men and co~mens of Rome had fyrst begynnyng.
THis maner of deuisyon of the com+mente from the estates of Rome: This discorde takyng of parties bytwene them: this inordinate custom of all other inco~uenyences began among the~ but a fewe yeres before this tyme by meane of ouer moche rest ad ydlenes: by superfluous habundance of richesse voluptuosite and of other worldely delectacions: whiche many counte repute for most chiefe pleasures of this lyfe.
For before the dystruction of Carthage the senatours and co~menty of Rome treated and gouerned the co~men+wele bytwene them peasably in loue and concorde.
So that among the citezins was no stryfe nor debate for laude excellence for dignite nor for great dominion.
The drede whiche they had of their ennemis made them warre and kept them in good maners causyng them to gouerne their cite with good vertues institutes without variance without robbery without oppression without slaughter nor other lyke cruell tyran+nies.
But whan Carthage was ouercome anone was expulsed fere from theyr myndes: and voluptuosite wantonnes pride (which ar greatly loued in welth and prosperite) anone entred their myndes: so that they desyred peace wha~ they had warre.
But wha~ the warre was ended: that they had peace and ydlenes after theyr owne desyre: theyr peace and rest was more sharpe more bytter more intollerable and more perillous to them tha~ the warre was before.
For the estates began to tourne theyr dignite worshyp into immoderate affection of great lordshyppe and dominacion.
And the co~men people began to tourne theyr libertie into lust and pleasure.
Euery man prouyded and drewe to hymselfe robbynge reauynge without measure from the co~men wele.
And the co~men wele which was in ye myddes bytwene the~ on euery syde was pylled robbed vtterly wasted of them both: on both sydes.
But the power of the noble men and of theyr party was more myghty than the power of ye co~mens.
For all the estates were all togyder assem+bled conioyned vnyed.
But the co~mens were dispersed and spredde abrode into dyuerse places and companyes gettynge theyr lyueng with labour of theyr handes swet of theyr bodyes.
So euerythyng was gouerned in peace and in warre at pleasure aduyse of a fewe priuate noble men.
The co~men treasoure the prouynces maistershyppes offices tributes worshyppe tryumphes and all other thynges longyng to honour or aua~tage were onely in hand{is} possession of the same fewe noble men.
But the simple co~men people was weryed oppressed with pouerty with batayle and warfare.
For the captayns with a fewe other noble men pulled suche prayes as were taken in batayle onely to theyr singuler auantage and behofe.
But in the meane season the parentes small chyldren of the soudyors were dryuen from their dwellyng places possessions by the sayd noble men: echone of them by that lorde vnto whom they dwelled nerest.
And so the myght power of such noble men co~ioyned with immoderate couetyse assayled defy+led wasted and dystroyed euery thyng without good maner without measure or moderacion: hauyng no respect nor co~syderacion of any thyng belongyng to goodnes or vertue: tyll they had so farforth proceded that at conclusion they were dystroyed ouerthrowen by theyr owne obstinate pride tyranny.
But at last assone as euersome of the estates were fou~de whiche remembryng and consydryng themselfe: set more by true and laudable glory than by iniust power and dignite.
And were moued in myndes by compassion to shewe mercy pyte agaynst the co~mente and to socour their misery than began the cite to be troubled and moued greuously for the courage of the co~mens was reuyued by supportacion of such noble men: by meanes wherof discorde and deuysion began to ryse in the cite as it were drye dust of the grounde raysed in a great tempestyous wynde.
For after that Tiberius Gracchus Caius Gracchus (whose progenitours moch encreased the co~men wayle in many batayls but namely in the batayle of Carthage) began to restore the comme~tie into theyr olde libertie and to detect the cruell mysdedes of the fewe iniurious estates.
Than all the lordes co~federate: and after ma+ner chafed with yre assembled theyr felowes as Latynians and some knyghtes of Rome which in hope of {pro}mocion left the co~mens party and helde with the noble men.
All these with suche as were to them lenyng of other nacions began to withstande the accuseme~tes of both the sayd Gaccus whiche were fauourers of the co~menty: first of all they slewe Tiberius Graccus.
And after that within a fewe yeres they slewe the other brother named Caius Graccus whyle he was {pro}tectour of the co~menty: bycause that he acordyng to lawe right deui+ded among the poore co~mente such land{is} as they had won in batayle of theyr ennemies.
And at the same season the estates put to deth also a lorde named Marcus Faccus bycause he defended the co~mens liberte agaynst theyr extorcion.
But tou+chyng the two brethern Tiberius and Caius Graccus: sothly their myndes were greatly immoderate and vnmesurable in theyr desyre to ouercome the states.
Neuerthelesse it had be moche better to the states to haue suffred them in theyr ryghtwyse tytell somwhat to haue inclyned to theyr myndes than to haue ouercome them so violently and slayne them so iniuryously how beit that they were ouer hasty besy.
But whan the states had the victory of them after their desyre pleasure than put they to deth the co~menty without nombre and many they exiled droue out of the cite.
In somoch that fro~ thens forth they rather encreased theyr crueltie and feare to the commens than their owne honoure or power.
By which meanes many worthy citees haue often tymes ben dystroyed whyle the estates and commens contende the one to ouercome the other by one meane or other.
And whyle the party vyctoure wyll punysshe ouer greuously that party which is ouercome.
But yf wold prepare to write of the besynesse and dedes of both the parties seriatly dystincly.
And yf shulde touche all the maners of the cite acordyng to the gretnesse of the mater and as it requyreth: othely the tyme shuld fayle me rather than the mater.
Wherfore wyll omyt this superfluous and infenite besynes and retourne to my first mater and purpose touchyng this cronycle of this tyranne Iugurth.
¶Howe Metellus was creat consull and sende by the Romayns to warre agaynste Iugurthe: of the wyse and dyscrete behauour of the same Metellus.
AFter the truse and composicion of Aulus before sayde made with Iugurth the foule shamkfull flyght of the romayne army: Quintus Metellus and Marcus Sillanus were creat proclamed consuls of Rome whiche acordyng to the olde custome parted deuyded the prouynces belongyng to Rome bytwene them bothe.
This Metellus was a fierse man and a noble a worthy warryour.
And howbeit he fauoured the party of the noble men and was co~trary to the party of the co~mens: neuertheles he was of fame vndefyled vnuiolat and cou~ted of good name indiffere~tly on both parties.
Assone as euer this Metellus entred in his office dignite he thought that euery thyng apartayning to his rowm charge belo~ged aswell to his partyng felowe as to hymselfe saue the warre of Numidy: whiche onely belonged to hymselfe to his {per}ticuler charge: Wherfore he co~mytted all other charges to Sillanus and onely sette his mynd to make prouysion for ye warre agaynst Iugurth.
But bycause he mistru+sted the olde army whiche was in Numidy with Albinus Aulus and had no co~fydence in the myndes of these soudyors corrupted with ydelnes many other vices: therfore he elected and assembled newe soudyours.
And of all suche as were felowes frendes confederate to the Romayns he called for helpe socours.
He prepared made redy armoure wepyn horse harnes and all other ordynaunce expedie~t to warfare.
And shortly to speke all thyng{is} he ordayned which ar wont to be necessary profitable to the variable chaunces incertayne accidentes and ieopardies of warre which requyreth reparacion of many thynges chargeable.
But suche as were felowes of the empire of Rome at instau~ce request of the senatours: and by theyr authorite and by the Latinians many other strange kynges of theyr owne frewyll sent socours to Metellus to auaunce hym in his enterpryse: And shortly to speke the hole cytie laboured withall theyr myght to socoure and ayde Metellus in his besynesse.
Thus at last whan euery thynge was prouyded and sette in order after his pleasure intent: than toke he his iournay into Numidy with great hope of all the cytezins of Rome that for his good maners: and specially for that his mynde was vnouerco~e with rychesse or coueryse that he shuld do more honoure to the empire than his predecessors had in the warre of Numidy.
For before his departynge the welth of Numidy (by coueryse of the officers of Rome) was augme~ted: but the welth of the Romayns wasted and deminisshed.
Whan Metellus was come to Affrike the army was delyuered vnto hym by Albinus: which army was vncrafty sluggysshe feble nouther able to endure paryll nor labour of tunge more redy fiers and hardy than of hande: whiche was wont to robbe and pyll from felowes and frendes of the empire.
But it selfe endured by cowardise to be robbed and spoyled of ennemies of the empyre as a lawlesse dysordred co~pany of men vngouerned without authorite or maners.
Wherfore Metellus the newe capytayne hadde moche more thought besynesse for suche corrupt vicious maners of a company so farre out of order than he hadde helpe or good hope of confort in the multitude of them.
Thus howe beit he sawe the tyme of election of newe co~suls drawe nere.
And all yf he also vnderstode that the Romayns dayly loked after some ende of the warre.
These causes nat withstandyng yet he co~cluded nat to begyn the warre tyll he had excercysed and vsed the soudyors with besynesse labour aft the instruction and custome of olde captayns vsed before his tyme.
For why Albinus was so astonyed with the aduersite myschaunce of his brother Aulus and for murdre of his hoost: that after he purposed nat to depart out of the romayns prouince whiche was in Affrike he kept the soudyors alway ydell in theyr tentes as longe as the somer season lasted as long as he was in authorite in somoche that they chaunged no place except the corrupt sauoure of the place or els necessite of vitayle co~stray+ned them to remoue.
Nor accordyng to the custome maner of warryours amonge them was no watche: but euery man came went at his owne pleasure and absented the~selfe from theyr standardes whan it lyked them.
The scolyons pages wandred day nyght mengled among the horsemen chiefe of the soudyours without any order: And many other as rouers dyspersed abrode destroyed the countrey fyghtynge agaynst the small villages nat agaynst citees nor townes.
They caryed away from the sayd villages prayes of catell: and the inhabita~tes ledde away also with them as prisoners with other prayes stryuyng togyder who myght haue most and than after chaunged the sayde roberies with marchauntes for delycious strong wynes caryed from other strange countreis where better wyne grewe than in that cou~trey: and for other suche delycious thyng{is}.
They solde away the where and other vitayles which was delyuered of theyr capytayns among them in co~men dayly they bought theyr bread.
And finally what euer shame or rebuke longyng to couetyse or lechery: coude outher be sayd done or ymagined of any man: all was vsed in that hoost.
And among some: more shamefull dedes than ought to be named.
But Metellus hehaued hym selfe as a myghty wyse man nat lesse this difficultie hard+nesse than if it had ben in a batayle foughte~ agaynst his enne~+mies as he which in myddes of so great couetyse voluptuesite cruelty was syngulerly indued with te~peraunce: merueylous good maner vsed he in coartynge the same fautes.
Wherfore at the first begynnynge he withdrewe auoyded from the army at his commaundeme~t ordinaunce: the occasyons which styred the soudyours to suche slouth cowardyse and voluptuosite.
For he commaunded vnder great payne that no person shulde be so hardy to sell among the soudyours nouther bread nor other vitayle all reddy dressed saue the co~men {pro}uisyon: that the pages waterlaggers scolyons shuld nat co~e nere the army nor folowe the same.
That none of the co~men simple sodyours shulde kepe or mentayne seruaunt nor beest in theyr tentes nor vyage whyle they moued fro place to place.
After these amended: all other fautes he mesured by his wysdome craft and policy: refourmynge them by lytell lytell.
This done (to haue his soudyours occupyed) he moued dayly from place to place: and that nat in wayes co~men vsed but by harde and vnoccupyed wayes.
He caused them dayly to cast dychesse trenches about the army to the intent that they shuld nat waxe slouthfull nor vicious by ouermoch rest ydlenesse.
He ordayned often watche among them euery nyght: and he hymselfe acompanyed with his vnder captayns and heed officers often serched yf the watches were truely kept co~passyng about the army on euery syde.
Whyle they remoued chaunged places: somtyme he was in the forwarde and amonge the first: somtyme in the rerewarde or hynder part and anone in the myddes ouerseynge theyr order to the intent that none shulde passe out of order aray and place to them assigned.
But kepe thicke togyder euery man co~pany about theyr owne standerd{is}: and also he ordayned that among themselfe they shulde conuey cary theyr owne vitayles and armoure.
And thus in short tyme he confermed and sette the army in good order rather with fayre wordes or rebukyng blamyng theyr fautes: prohybityng their dysorder: than in chastisyng or punysshyng their offe~ces wt rygour or crueltie.
¶Of the behauour of Iugurth agaynst Metellus: and howe he sende embassadours to Metellus requyring vnfaynedly to yelde vp the kyngdome of Numidy to the empyre of Rome: And howe Metellus behaued hymselfe agaynst the same embassadours.
IN the meane seaso~ whan Iugurthe vnderstode by messangers espyes of this behauour of Metellus: and also wha~ he remembred that which was infourmed to hym at Rome of the integryte and vndefyled name of Metellus whiche wolde nat be corrupte with money nor accloyed with brybes lyke other before: he began to mystruste his mat+ters and to haue lasse confydence in his cause thanne euer he had before.
In somoche that than he began to laboure to yelde hymselfe vnfaynedly and to make a trewe composytion with Metellus and the Romayns without any fyction gyle or disceyt.
Wherfore he sende embassadours with supplicacions peticions requyring humbly of Metellus to graunt to hym his owne lyfe: and the lyfe of his chyldren onely: and concernyng all other thyng{is} he wolde yelde them into handes of the romayns.
But Metellus knewe well ynough long before this tyme by often experience profe yt the Numidians of naturall disposicion were vnfaythfull mouable and vnstable of myndes: newfangled and moche desyrous of newe besynesse newelties.
Wherfore he began with the embassadours of Iugurth tastyng and prouyng the mynde of eche of them by lytell and lytell: and separatly one by one.
And whan he knewe that they somwhat inclined to his purpose: he than pro+mysed to them great gyftes promocion so that they wold do some pleasure for hym for the senatours people of Rome.
Than at last he counsayled and desyred them to delyuer Iugurth to hym alyue specially if it myght be brought about: and yf they coude nat so than to delyuer hym outher quicke or deed.
But whan he had made this apoyntement secretly with thembassadours deuyded in sonder one by one: than openly (that euery man myght here) he shewed to them all togyder other thynges as his pleasure was that they shuld certyfie their kynge Iugurth concernynge their embassade.
After this within fewe dayes whan he sawe his hoost moost redy and contrary to Iugurth he remoued his tentes and so addressed hym with his army redy in aray and went forward into Numidy: where contrary to any similitude of warre the vyllages and cotages were full of men the feldes full of beest{is} and tylmen: and euery where was moche plenty of people yonge and olde namely rude people tyllers of the grounde whiche had styll fled before the army in foretyme for feare but at the last whan they sawe no defence nor socoure the kynges lewtenantes and all other left their townes villages and lodges and went forthe to mete Metellus withall humilite honour and seruice submittyng themselfe to hym and redy to gyue to hym whete and other corne suche as they had.
And to cary vitayles after his hoost to ease the soudyours and to do and parfourme all other thynges what euer they were commaunded.
But for all this: Metellus was nat lesse diligent nor circumspect in orderyng of his hoost but proceded forwarde togyder with his army i~ aray redy in armoure and de+fended as if theyr ennemies had ben nere at hande serchynge the countrey abrode on euery syde by his espyes doutynge treason and thynkyng that all these tokens of subiection were but for a face or cloke to couer the treason gyle of Iugurth.
And so by suche dyscet to wayt a tyme to execute his treason.
Wherfore Metellus thus mysdemynge kept hymselfe in the forwarde of the hoost with an elect and chosen company of archers slyngers and other lyke soudyours apoynted in lyght harnes.
His vnder captayne Caius Marius had rule and charge of the rerewarde amonge the horsmen and on bothe the wynges of his hoost he ordayned horsmen other soudyours for supplement subsidy and socouts of the forwarde yf nede shulde requyre and amonge them to expell their ennemies on what syde so euer they shulde come were mengled bowmen and other lyght harnysed fotemen with dartes pykes and iauelyns to trouble the horsmen of theyr ennemies.
For in Iugurth was so moche gyle so great experience and knowledge of the countrey and also so great practyse of chyualrie: that a man coude nat well knowe whether he were more to be douted or more greuous in peace or i~ ware or whyle he was absent or present.
¶Nat farre from that way whiche Metellus helde with his army was a towne of the Numidyans moche acustomed and frequented of marchantes of Italy and other strange countreis: and the princypall market towne of all the kyngdome of Numidy.
This towne was named Vacca Metellus drewe hym and his army thyder and set garnyson into the same towne.
This dyd he to proue the myndes of the inhabytantes: for if they had kept forth the garnyson thanne shulde they euydently haue declared themselfe ennemies of the romayns.
And also he ledde a garnyson thyder to thintent to haue taken the towne by force of armes yf the inhabytauntes wolde nat haue admytted the same garnyson.
Also he commaunded vytayls and all other thynges necessary or expedyent to warre for to be brought thyder thinkynge (as the case required) that the concours of marchantes resortyng thyder.
And his good prouision of vytayls shulde be great defence and conseruacyon for hym and his army bothe in warre and in peace.
But whan the citezins sawe such purueyance as he made of vitels considring that he shulde nat hurt nor disprouyde them whyle he had vytell ynough of his owne prouysion: anon they ope+ned the gates and suffred hym to entre withall his garnyson and retynue.
But in the mean tyme Iugurth agayne sende his embassadours to Metellus more diligently and instau~tly than he had done before mekely besechyng and requyring hym of peace: And yeldyng vnto hym euery thynge onely reserued his owne lyfe: and the lyfe of his chyldren.
Metellus sende these embassadours home agayne attysed to the prodycion of their maister Iugurth as he had done to the other embassadours which were sent before.
But concernyng ye peace which they desyred in their maisters name: nouther he grau~ted nor vtterly denyed it.
And in this prolongynge of tyme he loked alway after parfourmynge of the promesse of the other embassadours whiche before had graunted to the betrayeng of Iugurth.
But whan Iugurth consydred and pondered to+gyder the wordes dedes of Metellus and whan he parceyued in mynde himselfe assayled with his owne craftes of subtylte: and that Metellus vsed suche craftes agaynst hym as he hymselfe had vsed agaynst other: than was his mynd greued most of all.
For Metellus fayned peace but in very dede he shewed sharpe warre.
Iugurth thus co~sydred also: that his greattest towne named Vacca was alienate lost from hym: his ennemies by longe continuaunce and exercise knewe the coostes of his countrey of Numidy.
The myndes of his lordes and co~mens were prouoked and moued agaynst hym.
Whan he aduysed these difficulties with other mo co~trary to hym he co~cluded fully determined at last to resyst and withstane Metellus in batayle with strength force of armes and no farther to meke nor submitte hymselfe by peticion.
¶Howe Iugurth prepared and addressed hymselfe agayne to warre: and what ordynaunce and policy he vsed agaynst the newe consull Metellus.
WHerfore Iugurth thus determyninge to assayle Metellus cause his wayes to be espyed hauyng hope of victorie by auauncement auauntage of some place: where he intended of the place and countrey: and anone prepared the greattest army yt he coude of all sortes of people.
This done he dyd so moche that by hylles narowe passages by pathes he preuented an ouerpassed the hoost of Metellus.
¶In that parte of Numidy whiche before in deuysion of the kyngdome was assigned in possessyon to Adherball: was a flodde named Muthull rennyng from the meridyonall part of the countrey.
certayne hyll hy and longe was nere to this water so that at any place the hyll was about .xx. myle from the streme and of equall dystance in length.
The grounde of this hyll was of suche nature that euer it was barayne wherfore it was nat apte to mennes habitacion but desert.
About the myddes and pendant of it was an other hyll smaller of quantite: but of an vnmesurable heght couered and all ouergrowen with wylde olyue trees with myr trees other sortes of trees wont to growe naturally on dry sandy grou~de.
The playne bytwene the hylles and the water was desert and vnhabitable for lacke of water: saue such places of the playne as were nere to ye flodd of Muthull which part was growen with small trees and occupyed with men beestes.
Iugurth came to the sayd small hyll whiche descended from the penda~t of the hyll greatter ouerthwart the valey.
And ther toke place with his army nat togyder but dispersed abrode amonge the trees by companyes and bendes he made his frende Bomilchar capitayne and gouernour of his oliphantes and of part of his army of fotemen and infourmed hym parfitely howe he shulde behaue hymselfe and gouerne them whome he had commytted to hym bothe before the batayle and also in the batayle whan it came to the poynt.
But he hymselfe drewe nerer to the great hyll withall the horsmen and many of the fotemen whiche were elect and chosen men and sette them in ordre and array with moche policy and wysedome.
This done: he hymselfe went about compassed euery company cohort and bende syngulerly: and one by one warnynge and requyringe them to call to theyr myndes theyr olde strength{is} nobles and victorie: and there by to defende themselfe and their countrey of Numidy from the immoderate couetyse of the romayns whiche were nat content nor tatisfied with the possession of the most part of the worlde saynge fathermore that they shulde fyght but with suche as they before had auercome and subdued.
And howe beit they had chaunged theyr capytayne: the cowardise of their hertes was nat chaunged: Also he rehersed declared to the~ that he had made all prouision for them whiche a captayne mygh or ought to make for his army.
He declared howe he had taken for them the vpper place: that they were crafty in batayle and many in nombre: shulde fyght with a fewe vncrafty cowardes.
Wherfore he desyred exhorted them whan tyme shulde come that than they wolde be redy to assayle the Romayns manly at sounde of the trumpettes for that one same day sayd he shulde outher establisshe all theyr laboures victories and besynesses: or els it· shulde be the heed and begynnyng of their most great myschyefe and dystruccion.
Moreouer through out all his army he put them in reme~brance man by man of ye benefites which he had done to them before for their manly dedes of chyualry: as suche as for their worthynes he had rewarded with dignite money offices or other worshyp: and shewed suche vnto other co~men soudyours sayeng that if they wolde so demeane themselfe manly: so sholde they be promoted and auanced to worshyp and ryches.
And thus he conforted them all euery man after his maners and co~dicions some with gyftes some with promesses some with thretnynges and other lyke ways acordynge to the disposicion of their myndes and nature.
¶Whyle Iugurth thus exhorted his soudyours Metellus nought knowyng of his ennemies apered with his company dysce~dyng downe the pendant of the great hyll whiche at first seyng but fewe men moche marueyled what it myght signifie for he suspected nothyng lesse than batayle: but in beholdyng more inte~tyfly towarde the toppe of the small hyll afore hym he espyed among the yong trees bothe horse men whiche wer nat fully hyd bycause of the lownesse of the trees.
For what by secretnes of the place: and what by gyle of Iugurth their baners the most part of the soudyours were obscured hyd lyeng downe vpon the grounde.
But anone after whan he parceyued this gyle treason: by lytell lytell he set his army in array procedynge forwarde styll as he dyd before faynynge hymselfe ignora~t of the treason.
But he chaunged the order of his soudyours: and on the ryght wynge whiche was next to the Numidyens his ennemies he ordayned as it were a forwarde en+forced with a threfolde subsidy or socoures that is to say with thre bendes of proued soudyours to rescue helpe them whan nede shuld be.
The archers suche as wich slyng{is} shulde cast agaynst their enmis plu~mett{is} of led yron all other whiche were of lyght harnes: all these he deuided among the standerdes of other soudyours as the case requyred: where as after the ryght ordynaunce of batayle suche soudyours by them selfe deuyded shuld begyn the batayle but in this batayle the sytuacion of the place nat so requyred.
All the hole co~pany of his horsmen he ordred in the extremitees corners of the forefront of the batayle.
This done as the breuyte of the tyme suffred he made a short exhortacion vnto his soudyors so proceded forth with his hoost sette in array in maner beforesayd: but bycause Iugurth was on the small hyll before hym and by that meane on the hyer ground he thought to remedy that inco~modite led forth his hoost on the syde halfe nat towarde Iugurth but alonge on the hyll towarde the flodde of Muthull into the playne which was betwene the hyll the flood
But whan he sawe the Numidyens quyed and that they departed nat from the hyll which they had taken he co~sydred the hete and feruentnes of the somer season.
And lyst his army myght perysshe for lacke or scarcite of water: he sent before one of his capitayns named Rutilius with a co~pany of lyght harnessed soudyours and part of his horsmen vnto the flodde named Muthull for to take vp a place wherin they myght set their tentes in tyme of nede: thynkyng that his wyllyng to continue longe in that place by often and scarmysshes shulde disturbe the romayns whyle they resorted to the water.
And for asmoche as the Numidiens trusted nat moche in their strength and armoure.
He thought that they purposed and intended to trouble his sodyors with werynes and thurst.
Whan Rutilius was gone towarde the water Metellus descended procedyng forth withall by lytell lytell as the mater and place requyred: he commaunded one named Marius with his company to kepe in the rerewarde.
But Metellus hymselfe with the horsemen kept hym in the lyfte wyng of the forwarde of the batayle whiche alway remoued forwarde first of all his army.
BVt whan Iugurth sawe that the rereward of Metellus was passed his forwarde: he be set the hyll from whiche Metellus dyscended with two thousande fotemen by which garnyson if Metellus wold agayn take socour of the same hyll he shuld be prohibyted dryuen bacwarde agayne into the handes of Iugurth.
This done: sodenly he dyd the tru~petes to be blowen and anone withall inuaded set vpon the company of Metellus on euery syde.
The Numidyens assayled and bete downe the romayns some on the rereward and other some dyd their deuoyre to breke the aray on both sydes: both on the ryght lyft wyng withall their myght assaylyng the romayns and auaunsyng themselfe on euery syde to breke their array and ordynaunce.
And after theyr power to trouble dystourbe and deuyde them.
The romayns whiche were most stable and bolde of myndes in metyng their ennemies were abused dysceyued with the vncertayne batayle.
For their ordynaunce and array was set and strengthed onely but on one syde.
But their ennemies assayled them on euery syde: so that so~tyme they were stryken wounded of their ennemies from farre of but by no meanes coude they stryke their ennemies agayne nor ioyne wt them.
For Iugurth had taught his Numidiens on horsbake before the batayle that whan they shulde begyn to assayle the romayns: they shulde nat kepe themselfe togyder nor nere but asmoche dyspersed as they coude and in diuers places: one company here and and other there.
And where the soudyours of Iugurth coude nat auoyed nor repell the romayns whiche assayled them bycause they were mo in nombre: thefore they compassed trapped them behynde or on the sydes betyn of: and dysioyned from their company.
And where it fortuned any of them to fle the Numidyans had more auantage than the romayns.
For where they fled into the feldes: they assayled the romayns on the backe halfe or els on bothe sydes in dyuers companyes.
But where they sawe it was more auayle and expedie~t to fle agayne to the hyll where they set first their ordynaunce.
They had also auantage therby for their horses were acustomed to mountaynes and combred wayes wherfore they mounted with lesse difficultie but in co~trary wyse the romayns for the sharpnes of the hylles and lacke of vse coude nat folowe them in their asse~dyng without moch difficulte payne and paryll.
But nat withstandynge that Iugurth and his men had the most auantage of the countrey and grounde yet the batayle on both sydes was variable vncertayne vngoodly and myserable to beholde: for the best men sonest were slayne and in moost ieopardy.
For the courage and valyant myndes bolde hertes of the romayns: was worth the gyle and treason of the Iugurthyns: and so on bothe sydes he which was boldest and moost auau~ced hymself was sonest ouerthrowen.
Some which were deuyded from their owne company and in hand{is} of their ennemies gaue place to them and yelded themselfe.
And agayne some folowed and chased their ennemies fleyng: where they myght make their{per}ty good: there resysted eyther partie manly.
None of both parties kept vnder their stander+des: nor folowed nat the order of batayle: nor kept none order nor array but euery man resysted and defended hymself ther where moost ieopardy and paryll was layed to hym: and endeuoyred hymselfe to withstande the vyolence of his ennemis with hye valyantise.
And so the armour defensyfs dartes me~ horse Romayns Numidyans soudyours and pages were all confounded and mengledde togyder: without orde or ordynaunce obserued.
Nothyng was done with dyscression of the soudyours nor with counsell of the captayns: vnauysed fortune and chaunce gouerned all the bysynesse of that day: so vnstable was the batayle.
All was committed to rule of fortune And thus passed forth moche of the day in great murder and slaughter yet styll was the ende of the batayle vncertayne and none knewe whytherpartye shulde haue the vyctorye.
At last bothe parties with labour and heat began to languysshe and become wery.
Metellus vnderstandynge that the Numidyans lesse resysted infyghtyng than they dyde before assembled and gathered togyder agayne his soudyours by lytell and lytell and without tary restored the aray and set them agayne in order.
And .iiii. cohortes taken forth of the legyons he set agaynst the fotemen of his ennemies.
But before Metellus had thus assembled his company: a great parte of them oppressed with woundes and werynesse withdrewe the~self to the hyll before named and to the hyer places from the ba+tayle there to refresshe and rest themselfe.
But whan Metellus (as sayd is) had reasembled them agayne: he began infewe wordes to pray and exhort them in suche maner.
¶O worthy and trusty soudyours and companyons dyscourage nat your selfe in this batayle nor lette nat your olde noblenesse nowe fayle you: suffre nat your ennemies wont to put their trust in flyght nowe to ouercome you by your ferefull myndes.
Reme~bre well: if ye be dysposed cowardly to fle: ye haue no tentes no cyties no townes no castels nor no maner places of defe~ce: wherto ye may renne for refuge and saue your selfe. your helth your hope defence is onely in your ar+moure and strength: specially in your bolde hert{is}.
Wherfore dere frendes reme~bre your olde worshyp: suffre nat the hole empire of Rome to suffre dysworshyp by your temerous and coward{is} myndes.
Reme~bre it worthyer to dy in batayle lyke men than to fle than to be taken murdred lyke beestes or to dye in prison.
With these wordes suche lyke Metellus reco~forted the hertes of his soudyours.
But in meane tyme Iu+gurth for his part was nat ydle quyet nor lesse prouident: but compassed and went about his men co~fortyng and exhortyng them also and praysing their dedes.
He renued the batayle also for his part: and among the myddes of his elect soudyours he fought and proued thextremite of euery thyng: and assayd all meanes wherby any auantage myght be wonne co~forting and socourynge his men with wordes dedes and exa~ple.
He boldely fought and assayled suche of the romayns as were in fear or dout: and suche as he knewe proued bolde and stedfast he kept them of with arowes iauelyns and dartes that they coude nat approche to their felowes to auaunce them nor to be socoured of them.
Thus two worthy men noble and exel+cent captayns fought co~tended togyder bytwene themselfe.
They themselfe lyke in strength courage wysdome and policy: but of thynges longyng to chyualry vnlyke of prouision.
For Metellus had strength of soudyours sufficiently: but the auantage of the countrey and place was moche contrary to hym.
But Iugurth had euery thyng necessary and expedyent saue company of men of armes whiche he wanted.
¶At last the romayns whan they vnderstode that there was no sure place wherto they myght fle: and also that they coude fynde no meanes to fyght with their ennemies indifferently hande to hande.
And that the nyght was come vpon them: at last they ascended vpon the toppe of an hyll whiche was ouer agaynst them lyke as Metellus their captayne commaunded them to do.
For the Numidyans had lost that place and were fledde and spredde a brode dyspersed but fewe of them were slayne.
For they were swyfte: and the contrey was nat well knowen to the Romayns to pursue them: wherby many of the Numidyans were defended: and so by flyght escapedde.
But Iugurth with his horsemen of garde for his body: fledd also from the batell whan he had longe foughten and sawe no+ne auayle nor auantage.
¶How Bomylchar vndercaptayne of Iugurth and his company were dysconfited by Rutilyus vndercaptayne of Metellus.
IN the mean season Bomylchar who~ Iugurth had made maister of his elyphantes and of a part of the fotemen (as haue written before) assone as he sawe that Rutilius (which Metellus had sent vnto the flodde of Muthull to prouide a place for their tentes) was ouerpassed his company: by lytell lytell he conuayed and ledde downe his company into a playne.
And whyle this Rutilius hasted hym towarde the flodde as he was co~maunded of Metellus.
Bomilchar set his company in order array styll quietly as the mater and case requyred.
And in meane tyme he forgat nat to serche by espies what Metellus dyd and what way Rutilius toke toward the sayd flodde: and in what maner he behaued hymselfe gyded his army.
Wherfore after he vnderstode by his espyes that Rutilius with his co~pany had taken their pla+ce by the sayd flodde where he wold abyde: and was voyde of besynes quyet and doutyng no paryll.
And on the other syde whan he vnderstode that the cry of the batayle bytwene Iugurth Metellus encreased: he feared lest Rutilius (if he vnderstode therof) wolde leue his place by the flodde: and retourne to the batayle to socour his felowes which were in ieopardy.
In this consideracion Bomilchar: where as before he had ordered his army nere togyder by craft and that bycause he mystrusted the courage of his men: and in their boldnesse had no great confidence.
Therfore nowe agayne he deuyded them a brode moche larger than they were before: and so procede towarde the tentes of Rutilyus to thintent to lette hym and his company on euery syde if they prepared towarde res+cous of Metellus.
Rutilyus and his company suspectynge no peryll sodaynlie of vnware aduysed great vyolence of smo+ke and duste styred vp and raysed by mouynge of the grounde: but what it myght be they coude nat parceyue by any meane bycause of the thicknesse of the yonge trees that grewe on all the grounde bytwene them which letted their syght.
First of all they thought it had proceded of drines of the ground by mouyng of the wynde.
But afterwarde whan they sawe the same smoke and dust contynue styll after one maner: and that the same approched alway nerer and nerer lykewyse as the company of their ennemies moued and drewe toward them.
Than they parceyued and knewe the mater as it was: and in all hast euery man toke to hym his harnesse: and stode redy be+fore the defence of their te~res as their captayne Rutilyus had ordred and commaunded them euery man redy at defe~ce and in aray.
After whan their ennemies approched nerer with an horryble noyse and cry they ranne togyder on bothe parties.
The Numidyens dyd but onely co~tynue the skirmysshe abydynge lokyng after their elypha~tes in helpe of whome was all their trust.
But whan they sawe that their elypha~tes were stopped lette with thyckenesse of the bowes of the treis: and so taryed kept from their socours by the co~passyng of the romayns so that in them was no trust of socours.
Than all they toke them to flyght with all their power.
But many of the~ (leuyng their armour behynde them) escaped without wounde by helpe of the hylles whych were about the place: which they coude better quicklyer ascende than the romayns.
And also by socour of the darknesse of the nyght (which than was at hande) many of them escaped hole sounde and saued themselfe.
Foure of the elyphantes were taken and all the remena~t (fourty in nombre) were slayne.
Whan this was done: the co~pany of Rutilius nat withstandynge that they were fatigate and weryed with great iourneis before and also with moche labour in orderyng of their tentes: with the sayd batayle or skirmysshe: neuertheles whan they sawe that Metellus their chefe captayne taryed longer than they thought he wold haue done yf all thynge had happened well with hym they ordred themselfe redy diligently went backwarde agayne to mete hym.
For the falshode and gyle of Iugurth and of the Numidyans caused them to be besy dilige~t and circumspect in euery thyng for sauegard of their lyues suffred them to do nothyng slouly nor with delayeng.
But whan they were in their iourney in the darknesse of the nyght the companyes on both parties were nat fare in sondre the one from the other: and bothe parties approched togyder nat knowyng eche other as if they had ben ennemies.
The one agaynst the other making noyse and clamour eche one increasyng fear to other as warryours ar wont to do at begynnyng of a batayle.
Insomoch that a miserable dystruction murdre had almost ben co~mitted bytwene them by their imprude~t negligence if the espyes and horsmen whiche were sent bytwene them on bothe sydes had nat with more dilige~ce wyselyer espied the treuth of the mater.
But whan the parties knewe eche other their sadnes and feare tourned to great ioye gladnesse.
The soudyours ioyfully anone met togyder one salutyng welcomy~g other.
One shewed to other their actes done on bothe parties: and ioyous they were to here on bothe sydes euery man commendyng exaltyng their owne dedes and also the ded{is} of other vnto heuen with myrthe gladnesse.
And that aswell such as were worthy men as vnworthy cowardys ascrybed to themselfe worthynesse.
And certes in such busynesse it often happeneth that on that syde which hath the victorie: suche as be but cowardes rude and vncrafty exalteth them enioyeth and may bost themselfe on other mennes dedes and worthynesse.
But in co~trary wyse on that partie which is ouercom though many be good warryours noble worthy men: yet ar they reputed for coward{is} without policy bycause of other mennes cowardyse aduersyte of fortune.
But whan Metellus Rutilius (as haue sayd before) were mette togyder and rehersed their actes one to other Metellus hasted hym withall his army to the flodd of Muthull and taryed in the places tentes whiche Rutilius had prepared seiourned there the space of foure dayes.
In this season he was besy in refresshyng healyng his soudyours whiche were wounded suche as manly had behaued themselfe in the batayle he worthely rewarded them he called them togyder all into one co~pany and greatly landed commended them: thankyng moch praysyng them for the great dilyge~ce payne and labors: whiche they had taken in defence of the honour dignite of their empire with suche wordes.
¶O worthy soudyours ye se nowe that the hardest of our labour is ouerpassed by your boldnesse and manhode: wherfore exhort you: be ye of lyke courage in the resydue of our besynesse whiche shalbe but lyght easy in comparyson of this which is ouerpassed.
The begynnyng and first brunt of euery besynesse is hardest.
Whiche shall be but lyght vnto bolde and circu~spect begynners constant folowers of their enterprises.
But this begynnyng ye haue manly ouercome by constant labour as thyng moost easy. ynough haue we foughten all redy for the glorie of victory: for that haue we optayned in this first co~flyer.
If we labour or fight any more it shalbe but onely for prayes and robberies of our ennemies: wherby we shalbe enryched in substance: lyke as we nowe be inhaunced with glorie of victory.
Wherfore my dere felowes most constant frendes of the co~men welth nowe exhort you for co~plement of all your honorable fame: to reme~bre your olde acustomed worthynesse.
And suffre nat this excellent honoure glorie which ye haue nowe optayned by boldnes: to be quenched and decay agayne by ignomynious cowardyse.
¶With suche wordes many other lyke Metellus reconforted his co~pany: maruelously kyndled their courage to the desyre of honour by valyant feates of armes.
But in ye meane season the knowen gyle of Iugurth went nat from his mynd and therfore to exclude all danger of treason he sent forth certayne of the Numidiens which betraynge Iugurth had forsaken hym fled to the romayns: also with the~ he sent forthe dyuerse other of his owne company which were expert of the countrey and oportune to suche besynesse to serche and espye among what people or in what place Iugurth held hymselfe: and wherin he was ocupyed.
Whyther he kept hym wt a small company: or whyther he had an army reassembled for a newe batayle and how he behaued hymselfe where about he went syth he was ouercome.
But Iugurth had conuayed hymselfe into such places as were full of dychesse valeis hylles treis busshes dales defended of nature.
And there had he assembled agayne a newe army of men mo in no~bre than he had before.
But they were but vncraftie inerpert and dull to batell: and coude better tyll the grounde and kepe beestes than excer+cyse the dedes of chiualry.
For therto had they neuer ben vsed before: but in the other seruyle ocupacio~s besynesse had they ben ocupyed all their lyftyme without intermixtion of other ocupacion.
It fortuned that Iugurth had none other soudyours but suche rurall people about hym at this tyme namely for this cause.
For whan he fled from the batayle foughten before with Metellus none of all his soudyours folowed hym except the horsmen of his garde.
For all the other soudyours departed where it lyked them best.
Nor this is nat cou~ted nor reputed for any faute or rebuke among the Numidyens soudyours.
For suche is the custome of the countrey: whan the capitayne fleeth the hoost forsaketh hym. ¶what wast and dystruction Metellus made in the lande of Numidy after this first batayle and flyght of Iugurth: and of the gyle of Iugurth agaynst Metellus.
WHa~ Metellus vnderstode by his espyes that the mynde of Iugurth co~tinued yet styll in his olde fyersnesse crueltie thoughe he was lately ouercome in batayle.
And whan Metellus sawe that Iugurth renewed the warre agayne and prepared a newe batayle whiche coude nat be done but at pleasure of Iugurth bycause he had taken suche a place to abyde in that no man coude co~ueniently co~tende with hym for dyfficultie therof.
Namely he consydred that they were nat in different egall on bothe parties in executyng therof.
For all yf that he had the vpper hand ouer Iugurth had put hym to flyght: yet lost he mo men and had more da~mage in ouercomyng hym than Iugurth had whiche was ouercome.
For this consyderacion Metellus purposed no more to contende with hym in playne feldes nor in ordered batayle but by an other maner to execute the warre with hym from thensforthe.
This determyned: Metellus with his hole hoost and ordynaunce went forth into the moost ryche and plentyfull places of all Numidy and there wasted and dystroyed the feldes cou~trey on euery syde.
He toke without any resystence castels and townes nat strongly defended with walles dychesse nor garnyson.
All suche as came in his way and were able to bere harnesse: full growen of age or apt to batayle: he slewe and ryd out of hande.
Thynkynge that the mo he slewe the fewer aduersaries and ennemies shulde he haue to contende agaynst hym.
He co~maunded his soudyors to spare no robbery nor prayes: but gaue althyng to hauocke among his soudyours.
¶For feare of this crueltie many of the Numidyens yelded themselfe to the romayns: and gaue vnto them hostages vytayls sodyours and all other thynges necessary abunda~tly.
Insome townes whiche were taken: Metellus sette defence and garnyson where nede requyred and fortified them sufficiently.
This besynesse troubled the mynd of Iugurth moche more than the batayle that was foughten before to his great dammage and disconfort of his men.
For he lost more people by this way than by any other meane before.
Thus Iugurth whiche before put all his hope and trust in his flyght: was nowe of necessite compelled to folowe and pursue his ennemies: and he whiche coude nat defende his owne places whiche styll remayned in his possession: was constrayned nowe to warre in those coostes which Metellus had wonne of hym to recouer them yf fortune wolde suffre hym.
Neuertheles of suche poore shyft and counsell as had he toke the best which coude be taken by his aduyse in suche extreme necessite.
He commaunded his army for the most part to remayne styll in the same place where they were.
And he hymselfe with a company of horsemen whiche were bolde and chosen men ensued Metellus priuely makyng his iouneis by nyght tyme by by wayes and secrete valeis.
And at last sodenly of he fell vpon a part of the romayns which were dispersed a brode from the hoost in foragynge and spoylinge.
None of them all escaped clene nor fre without dammage but outher were orels sore wou~ded.
Whan Iugurth had done this skyrmisshe anone he withdrue hymselfe and his company into the hylles and mountaynes next to them: before any socours or rescous myght come from Metellus to reuenge their treason deth of the romayns.
¶Of the great ioy which was demeaned at Ro+me for this worthy behauour of Metellus: and howe he gyded hymselfe and his army to contynue and augment this honour which he had goten.
WHyle Metellus and Iugurth stryued thus togyder: the one with manhode wysdome strength: the other with treason craft gyle: Tidynges were brought to Rome of this noble behauour of Metel+lus.
Ouer all the cite was demeaned great ioye gladnes for that Metellus behaued hymselfe gyded his army acordyng to ye maner ordinau~ce of olde noble capitayns of the romayns before his days.
And howbeit he was in place aduers contrary to hym yet had he the vpper hande of his ennemies as victorie ouer them.
And by his strength manhode he had in possession the cou~trey of his ennemies: had driuen them from place to place.
All these thyng{is} co~sydred: they moch reioyced greatly co~mended Me+tellus: namely for that he had caused Iugurth to put his trust of helth onely in fleyng into the mou~tayns wyldernesse whi+che before was magnificent proude by the fear cowardyse of Aulus predecessour of Metellus.
Wherfore for these fortunat glorious dedes of Metellus the senatours decreed and co~mau~ded ouer all the cite sacrifices suffrages to be done to their ydolles.
The citezyns whiche before were ferefull sore troubled doutyng the vnsure chau~ce incertayne fortu~e of the ende of this warre: demened nowe amonge them myrthe and gladnesse ouerall.
The honoure fame of Metellus was recou~ted very noble excelle~t gloryous in euery mannes mouthe.
Wherfore he somoche was the more dyligent and laboured more besely towarde the vyctore laboringe hastynge to finysshe the warr by all meanes wayes so it might be to his honour co~fusion of Iugurth.
But neuertheles he was well ware from puttyng hymselfe in danger of his ennemies: and was ware exchuynge oportunite of their gyle in euery place where he went.
He reme~bred well co~sydred that often after laude glorie foloweth enuy euyl wyll.
And therfore howe moche more noble that he was reputed: the more besy dilygent he was to mentayne his fame honour in drede to lose this worthy fame which he had optayned.
Nor after the foresayd gyle of Iugurth he suffred nat his hoost to deuide nor to departe themselfe dysparsed one from other: nor to make excourses to forage or spoyle in diuers places far dystant in sondre.
But whan they had nede outher of mannes meate or horsemeate: all the horsemen with great co~panyes of the fotemen went forthe kept them nere about suche as were sende forthe to make prouision to defende and socour them: if nede shulde requyre.
Metellus hymselfe deuyded his hoost in two partes: the one part he kept with hymselfe: the other he com+mytted to a noble warriour of his hoost named Marius bytwene them both they dystroyd wasted the contrey on euery syde but rather with fire than wt robbry or prayes.
Metellus Marius set their tentes in two places nat far dista~t in sondre.
But whan any perylous or nedy besynesse was to be done wt Iugurth or his co~pany whiche requyred great myght: than anone Metellus Marius were redy togyder: but they kept themselfe thus in sonder in dyuerse places to trouble the Numidie~s and increase their feare more largely in euery to make them fle and auoyde fer abrode in compasse for fear.
¶At this season Iugurth ensued by the hylles and desert pla+ces sekyng and espyeng a conuenient season or place to make some skyrmysshe with the romayns (that is to say) if he coud espy any parcell of them sekyng forth fountayns of water for the army of the which was moch penury in those costes.
If he myght any such espy than anone wold he breke downe fro~ the hylles vpon them.
Somtyme he shewed hymselfe to Metellus somtyme to Marius somtyme he wold assemble his co~pany togyder in a bend as if he wold fyght with the romains to atte~pt them anone aft wold he retourne agayne vnto the mountaynes.
And afterwarde sodenly appere agayne thretnyng nowe the one co~pany of the romayns nowe the other.
yet wold be neyther aue~ture batayle nor suffre neyther the romayns to be ydle or in rest nor yet hymselfe.
His mynde was onely sette to kepe his ennemies from their begynnyng purpose of distroyeng of the countrey whiche they intended.
¶Howe Metellus besyeged Samam one of the strongest townes of Numidy: and howe Marius vnder captayne of Metellus escaped the danger of Iugurth.
WHan Metellus sawe hym selfe so weryed with the gyles and craftes of Iugurth and that by no policy he coude haue faculty or tyme to fight with hym in playne batayle: at last he co~cluded to besyge assayle a great towne named zamam whiche was the most chefe strongest holde of all the realme of Numidy in that part of the lande where it was buylded.
And so sped hym thyder withall his army and ordinance where the sayd holde was (thynkyng as the mater requyred) that Iugurth wolde drawe thyder for defence of his chife towne and for socour and relefe of his people and so shulde the batayle be there foughten bytwene them.
But wha~ Metellus was in his iourney thyderwarde anone were certayn of his army which fled to Iugurth and certified hym of this prouision and interprise of Metellus.
Whan Iugurth herof was certified he hasted hym by gret iourneis so that he ouerpassed the co~pany of Metellus and came to the towne of zamam before hym: there exhorted the inhabitantes boldly to defende the walles.
And farthermore assigned to socour helpe them all suche as had fled from the romayns and had brought hym those tidyng{is}.
For they coude nat dysceyue hym but if they wolde yelde them agayne to the romayns whome they had forsaken and betrayed which thyng was nat sure to them to do.
Whan Iugurth had ioyned these soudyours to the garnison and socours of the towne and castell and had ordred apoynted all other thynges acordynge to his mynde: than he promysed to be there agayne with them with all his hole army in tyme of nede.
This done he departed from the towne into the most preuy secret places which he knewe in his countrey therby But whan Metellus was in his iourney towarde zaman he sende Marius for prouision of whete and other corne vitayle for the army vnto a towne named Sicca whiche was the first towne that forsoke Iugurth was yelded to Marius after the batayle late foughten with Iugurth to his great damage.
Whan Iugurth had knowledge herof he went thyder by nyght priuely with his elect soudyors so that whan Marius had sped his maters was redy to departe forth of the towne: Iugurth was redy at the gates to assayle the romayns cruelly cryeng with a hye voyce to them of the towne exhortynge them to assayle the romayns also on the backe halfe: saynge that fortune had offred to them the chaunce of a noble act of an excellent glorious dede: so that (yf they wolde folowe his desyre) they shulde restore hym agayne into his kyngdome themselfe into their libertie and from thensforth passe their tyme without peryll without dan+ger or drede.
And certaynely if Marius had nat boldely and strongly broken out of the towne with his standerdes men of armes through the thickest of his ennemies whiche were in the gates.
All they of the towne or the most part wolde haue broken theyr oth and promesse whiche they had made before to Metellus whan they first yelded themselfe and the cite is hym.
The myndes of the Numidiens be so vnstedfast and mouable.
But Iugurth so conforted his soudyours that they resysted the romayns a lytell season.
But wha~ Marius and his company began to encrease their violence agaynst the Iugurthyns and more fiersely to prease vpon them.
Anone some were slayne and the resydue fled with their maister Iugurth.
This daunger ouerpassed: Marius departed thens towarde the towne of zaman and at the last came thyder safe with all his co~pany and besynesse sped wherfore he was sent.
¶This Samam was a towne bylded in the playne grou~de without hylles or waters nere it defended rather by ye warke of mannes hande than by nature of the place.
For it was well garnissed both with men ordynaunce vitayls and armour.
Anone whan Marius was come: Metellus acordynge to the tyme and place made redy all thynges necessary and compassed the walles on euery syde wt his army: assignynge to euery one of his vndercapitayns a separate place of the towne to assayle and there to do his deuoyre and shewe his manhode.
Whan euery thynge was thus ordred Metellus commaunded to sounde to the assaut with trumpettes and
The romayns immediatly assayled the towne on euery syde wt horryble noyse clamoure.
The Numidiens therof were nat a drad at all: but abode styll and kept them selfe in sylence as if they had nat ben displeased nor prouoked to batayle: howe+beit they kept the walles euery man on the part to hym assigned all were redy to resyst to assayle the romayns.
The romayns exercysed and occupyed themselfe euery man wt suche wepyn as he coud best han+dell and was most expert in: some with slynges thrue plummettes of leed and some stones from a farre into the cyte and at them whiche defended the walles some assayled the towne nerer inuadyng the same and couetyng to haue entre and vndermyning the walles some boldly escaled walles desirynge to come so nere that they myght fyght hande to hand
On the othersyde thinhabitauntes of the towne and garnyson resysted manly.
Some rowled downe and ouertourned great weyghty stones on suche as were nerest to them and that vndermyned the walles.
Some pytched downe vpon them dar+tes iauelyns pykes firebrandes: and also great brennynge polles faggottes and blockys ouercouered with pytche and bre~stone ardenly flamyng.
Some boldly ouertourned the sca+lyng ladders and slewe ouerthrue suche as scaled the walles But some other whiche were farther from the towne and for prease coude nat approche nere to the walles in the meane season were nother fearfull nor ydell.
For there was no maner instrument of batayle whiche coude be throwen with hande or with any other ingyne of batayle: but that they thrue it into the towne wherwith they wounded and slewe many of the inhabitantes and of the defenders of the walles.
The dartes and crosbowes on bothe parties were nat vnoccupyed.
For at that tyme was no mencion of them nor they were nat yet inuent.
The romains which were farthest of all from the walles escaped nat fre: but with dartes were ouerthrowen in great nombre.
Howe beit their cowardous and fearfull myndes caused them to drawe themselfe aloufe behynde all other for to saue themselfe yet coude they nat auoyde the paryll.
Thus were the and vnworthy of the romayns in lyke ieopardy and paryll: but their glory and fame was moche vnlyke.
¶Howe Iugurth assayled and inuaded the tentes of the romayns in the meantyme whyle Me+tellus gaue assaut to the towne of zammam.
WHyle the assaut contynued thus at zammam with great murdre distruction on both {per}ties: Iugurth sodenly and of vnware stale downe from the mountaynes where he was hyd and with a great power of men assayled inuaded the romayns ten+tes whyle the soudyours whome Metellus had assygned to the warde defence of them were within the same at their rest: and suspecting nothing lesse than any suche assaut.
And euery man prouided for hymselfe acordynge to his maners and dysposycion.
Some whiche were cowardes fled withall their myght some other valiant and bolde herted men drewe to their harnes and manly withstode their ennemies.
Neuerthelesse the moost parte of them all were outher wounded or slayne.
But among all the company and of all the multitude of them were no more but .xl. men whiche abode.
These .lx. acompanyed themselfe togyder remembryng the worshyp of the empire of Rome and toke a place a lytell aboue their ennemies: whiche place they defended so manly that they coude nat be driuen from it by moche violence of their ennemies agaynst whome they thrue dartes from a far.
And suche dartes as their ennemies thrue at them: they thrue ye same agayn.
So they beynge but a fewe agaynst so many dyd nothyng in vayne.
For they coude throwe no dart but that it lyghted among the thyckest of them.
For they were so fewe: so nere togyder: on so sure a place that their enmies myght lytell thynge preuayle agaynst them.
But whan the Numidie~s approched nerer to them: than specially these .xl. valiant romayns shewed and bestowed thier manhode strength wt most excellent courage assayling their enmies: ouerthrowyng chasyng them backwarde by very force stre~gth.
¶In the meane tyme whyle Metellus was most of all ocupyed and besyed in the forsayd assaut of zamam: sodenly he herde behynde hym a great clamour noyse of people.
Anone he refrayned his horse: and in tournyng backe parceyued great co~panyes of men rennynge towarde hym: wherby he well knewe that they were of his owne people co~pany.
But wha~ he vnderstode all the chau~ce which was be fallen.
Anone in all hast he sent all the hole company of his horsmen vnto his tentes: soone after he sent thyder also his chife vndercaptayne Caius Marius with his retynue company to hym assigned.
And sore wepyng he obtested exhorted and besaught hym for all loue frendshyp: and for honour of ye co~men wayle that he wolde nat suffre any disworshyp or co~tumely remayne in the romayns that day whiche euerthytherto had ben victorious and ouercomers with great laude and honour: and that he wolde nat suffre their ennemy Iugurth and his co~pany to depart away vnreuenged.
But in the meane season Iugurth perceyued many of the kepers of the tentes fallen into the dyches that were made about the same for defence: so that for hast to ronne away they hurt themselfe more than he dyde.
Iugurth aduysing their daunger co~sydred that hymselfe was lyckely to be let vnder the same maner yf he auentured ouer farre.
And therfore he departed betyme into the surest places that he coude deuyse nere by leauynge many of his men behynde: outher deed or mortally wounded.
Thus was Marius frustrat of his labour: for Iu+gurth was fled before he came to the tentes.
But Metellus (without any thyng brought to ende at zama~) wha~ the nyght drewe nere: retourned with his hoost into his tentes.
On the next morne after before he retourned agayne to the assaut of zaman: he co~maunded all the co~pany of his horsmen to course vp and downe before their tentes on that syde wher they supposed Iugurth wolde come to socour his people.
The entres into the tentes and places nere to them he commytted and deuided to warde of his vnder capitayns.
After that he retourned agayne to the towne and fiersly assaylyd the walles in lyke maner as he had done the day before.
¶In the meane season Iugurth agayne sodenly stale vpon the romayns: specially on them which coursed before the ten+tes: they whiche wer next hym who~e he encou~tred first of all were a lytell tyme sore troubled abasshed: but the remenant of the romayns lyghtly assembled their socours.
And so valyantly behaued themselfe that the Numidie~s shuld nat long haue co~tinued the skyrmysshe: if their fotemen myngled with the romayns horsmen had nat in the mydell co~mytted great myschefe and dystruction.
For the horsemen of Iugurth trustyng to ye helpe of these fotemen which wer myngled among them: dyd nat first procede forwarde auau~cing themselfe and than retourne backe agayne as the vse is in a batayle of spere men.
But they ran in makynge incourses among the thyckest of the romayns ouerthwart and sydeling{is}: infoldyng dowblyng theyr courses: and co~tendyng to trouble dysorder the array and order of the forwarde and wynges of the romayne hoost.
Insomoche that what with the Numidyens on horsebacke with them on fote it lacked but lytell: but the romains were confounded and ouercome in that greuous conflict.
¶But here wyll leue the horsmen of the romains fightyng for their lyues and honour agaynst Iugurth and his speremen.
And nowe shall declare howe Metellus the chefe capitayn of the romayns behaued hymselfe with his hoost in the assaut of zammam.
¶How Metellus behaued himself for his part of the great co~flyct which the romayns had agaynst the Numidyans: Metellus with his fotme~ assaylinge the towne of za~mam for the one part: and Iugurth fiersly fighting with the romayns speremen for the other part.
IN the same tyme whyle this skirmysshe co~tinued bytwene the romains horsmen and the Numidye~s whiche were with Iugurth: the assaut also agaynst the towne of zammam indured with moche strengthe violence and murder.
And specially wher as Metellus had assigned his vnder captayns on euery syde of the towne (as haue sayd before) there co~tynued the assaut most sharply.
One of them put nat his trust nor hope in other: but euey man in his owne dedes in hymselfe.
Vnder the same maner dyd the garnyson inhabitantes of the towne behaue themselfe: they fought manly agayne also ordayned all thynges co~uenient for their defence in euery place of the towne.
Bothe the parties were redyer and more besye one to stryke wounde other than to defende themselfe.
The clamoure noyse was myxt with exhortacion and confort of some and the ioye of the quellars murderers was mingled with the wayling of them which were quelled murdred.
The sounde of the armoure horrious and strokes mounted to the ayre.
The sky was darked with dartes fleyng on eyther syde.
And the walles dychesse were dyed wt blode: and fylled with deed corses pytefull to se.
But whan the Numidiens were somwhat at layser and whan the romayns a lytell abated remitted the assaut: than they whiche defended the walles of the towne loked out a farre intentifely behelde the batayle of the horsmen which styll co~tinued.
There myght one haue sene them somtyme mery ioyous somtyme full of dolour heuynesse after as they sawe the case of the part of Iugurthe went forwarde or bacwarde.
And aswell as they coude be sene herde of their felowes which were with theyr kyng Iugurth: some warned them to audacite some exhorted them to courage other they gaue them signes wt their handes or with the iesture of their bodyes co~tenances mouyng and excityng them to boldnesse.
If they sawe a romayne stryke a Numidyan: they moued withdrue their bodyes auoyding the stroke as yf it had ben themselfe whiche had ben striken.
And if they sawe a Numidyen cast a dart agaynst a romayn: they moued their bodyes also as they had cast it themselfe.
Thus toke they so intentife hede to the batayle that they forgate themselfe where they were and it semed them that they had ben with their felowes in batayle.
Whan Marius which besyged the towne on that syde: vnderstode this maner behauour of the inhabitau~tes garyson: he abated his fiersnes for policy was more slowe in besyegyng of the towne than before fayning that he had no trust nor co~fidence to wynne it and suffred the Numidyens within the towne to beholde the batayle of their kynge for a whyle without any resystence or besynesse.
But wha~ he sawe them most intentifely beholdyng the batayle most amased for the besynesse of their felowes countrey men: than sodenly withall his power he gaue assaut to the walles so that many of the romayns with ladders and other ingynes had almost mounted vnto the hyghest part of them.
Thynhabitantes seynge this expelled their amasednes remembryng themselfe: and ran manly agaynst them with re+systence throwyng vpon them stones fyre all maner dartes of batayle.
The romayns at begynnyng resysted valiantly defendyng themselfe and auancyng them to the walles.
But whan thinhabitantes had first ouerthrowen and broken one ladder and than ouertourned an other.
Anone the remenant departed gaue ouer the walles vnder the best maner that they coude a fewe or none hole.
For a great part of them withdrewe themselfe transfired with mortall wondes.
Anone after the nyght fell vpon them whiche caused both the parties to desyst and leue of the batayle.
¶How Metellus remoued the siege from zammam: howe Bomylchar so {per}swaded Iugurth that he yelded hymselfe his kyngdome and all other thynges to mercy grace of the romayns.
And howe Iugurth after losse of his men treasour elephantes armour and horse: changed his mynde agayne.
BVt whan Metellus sawe his pur+pose and labour all in vayne: and that he coude nat wynne the towne.
and also that Iugurthe dyd nought but by gyle and falshode nor wolde nat fight but yf it were in places for his profet great auantage.
And also wha~ he perceyued that the somer was passed: he departed from the siege of za~mam: in suche townes as he had won of Iugurth whiche were strongly defended with walles water: he set garnyson soudyours of his co~pany to defende them.
But the remenant of his army he co~uayed ordred in the next {pro}uince vnto Numidy which was subget to the romayns: to remayne there tyll the sharpnesse of the wynter were passed.
in the meane tyme he suffred nat them nor hymselfe to be corrupted wc superfluous welth rest nor lechery: after the maner of other before hym.
But bycause the warre proceded forwarde but lytell with armour or strength: he bega~ to proue prepare treason agaynst a treatour dysceyt agaynst a dysceyuer: and gyle agaynst gy+le of Iugurth: and this thought he to proue by suche as were moost chefe frendes of Iugurth most familyer about hym.
So that he purposed to vse the falshode and treason of them agaynst their maister: in stede of armour and batayle.
Wherfore first of all he began to proue the mynde of Bomilchar whiche had ben before at Rome with Iugurth: and (as ha+ue sayd before) fled priuely fro~ thens for the deth of Massiua leuyng his sureties behynde i~ danger for his cause.
Metellus consydred that this Bomilchar (by cause of the great frendshyppe and familiarite whiche he had with Iugurth) sonest myght dysceyue and betray hym.
Wherfore (as haue sayd before) he began and went in hande with hym first of all by promisyng of great rewardes.
And first of all he dyd somoch: that this Bomilchar came priuely to Metellus spake with hym.
Metellus anone promysed hym on fayth treuth to do so for hym: that the senatours shuld pardon hym of all thyng{is} past and of his lyfe goodes.
So that he wolde betray or delyuer vnto hym Iugurth other quycke or deed: lyghtly he persuaded the numidyan.
For anon Bomilchar agreed therto: what for his treaterous false mynde which he had of na+ture.
And what for that he douted if any peace or composicion after that shulde be made bytwene Iugurth the romayns hymselfe shuld be delyuerd by co~dycion to the romayns to be punisshed for ye deth of Massiua whom he caused to be slayne at Rome.
This Bomilchar whan he sawe his tyme toke leue of Metellus on this apoyntement: and sone after came to Iu+gurth whome he founde doutefull in care and bewayling his aduers and myserable fortunes with profunde syghes and heuynesse and doutyng what way was most expedient to be taken.
Bomilchar after many wordes beganne to counsell warne hym praynge and obtestyng hym pyteously wepyng and wayling: and requyring that at last he wolde make some prouision for the sauegarde socours of hymselfe of his chil+dren frendes: and for the people of Numidy which well had deserued agnenst hym to be prouided for and better sene to.
Bomilchar also obiected to Iugurth howe he and his menne were ouercome in euery batayle and his people also diminisshed or alyenate from hym his feldes and townes wasted distroyd or els in possession of his ennemies his men some taken in prison.
Some slayne: and many wounded maymed the rychesse of his realme dyminisshed and wasted.
Bomilchar alleged also to hym that he had proued the strength of his soudyours and fauour of fortune sufficiently ynough wherfore it were better for hym to se some remedy and prouision for all these ylles and other mo and to beware lest whyle he prolonged the tyme and douted: the people of the countrey shulde prouide for themselfe without his aduise or counsell.
With these wordes and other lyke Bomilchar induced the kynges mynde to make some co~posicion or els to yelde hymselfe and all other thynges to mercy grace of the romayns.
Anone embassadors were sende to Metellus to certify hym that Iugurth was redy to do what euer he wolde desyre or co~maunde hym: and that he wolde co~myt yelde bothe hymselfe and his kyngdome to the fayth grace of Metellus: and of the romayns without any pactyon conuenaunt or exception: sauyng onely as it pleased them to deale with hym.
Metellus heryng of this mynde of Iugurth was very glade: and co~maunded all the most wyse noble worthy men of his army anone to be called togyder vnto hym from their wyntryng places.
Whan they were co~e than toke he cou~sell of them of other suche as he knewe wysest most discrete touchynge the embassade of Iugurth.
Anone it was co~cluded decreed among the counsell and declared to the embassadours (acordyng to the olde custome of Rome) that they shuld co~maunde Iugurth to sende to Metellus the romayns two hundred thousande pounde weyght of syluer: all his elypha~tes which he ocupyed in warre: and a certayne quantite of armour and a no~bre of his chife horse.
All these thyng{is} were fulfylled and done of Iugurth without any tary or delay.
Wherfore anone after Metellus co~maunded agayne that all they whiche had betrayed his hoost forsaken hym fled to Iugurth shuld be bounden so brought to hym agayne.
The most part of them were brought as he co~mau~ded: but a fewe of them whan they herde first of this co~posicion (feryng the same mater) fled vnto Bocchus kyng of the moryens.
¶Whan Iugurth after this maner was bereft of his armour of his horse of his men also of his treasour.
Anone after he was called by Metellus to come to a towne called Tysidium there to here what farthermore shulde be co~mau~ded to hym: to yelde hymselfe to thempire of Rome acordynge to his embassade.
But he began than to change to tourne his mynde agayne dredyng for the knolegyng of his cruell dedes that he shuld neuer escape co~digne punyssheme~t if he were ones i~ the romayns handes.
Thus he co~tynued many dayes in douring what was best to be done.
Somtyme he volued in mynde rather to subdue hymselfe to any difficultie to byde all paynes than to begyn warre agayn: co~sydring the aduers vnhappy fortune whiche he had before.
Somtyme agayne he called to mynde how greuous a fall it shuld be to desce~de from a kyngdome into subiection and bondage.
But at co~clusion whan in vayne to none effect he had lost suche great ordynaunce and helpe of warre as he had lately delyuered to Metellus: as a volage brayned man he fully determined agayne to begyn continue the warre with Metellus: rather than to yelde hym selfe to deth or captiuite.
¶But durynge this season at Rome was a counsell amonge the senatours concernyng thassignement of rule and gouernaunce of the prouinces belongynge to thempyre: in whiche counsell it was decreed that the countrey and warre of Numidy shulde be commytted to Metellus by prorogacion of his authorite for another yere more.
¶But here wyll leue a whyle to speke of Metellus: write of the ambicion of Marius: and how he behaued hymselfe in supplantyng the same Metellus for his rowme dignite.
¶How Marius by ambition laboured to be co~sull and to prosecute the warre of Numidy: and how he detracted and suppla~ted the consull Metellus.
AT the same season the sayd Marius was in a towne named Vtica and there made supplicacion oblacion to the ydolles with moche sacricfice to the intent that it myght be his fortune (by helpe) to haue the place of Metellus.
custome damnable was among the people at those dayes: whan they slewe any beest in sacrifice: to loke within the intrayles and bowelles of ye same best so sacrifised.
where was shewed vnto them dyuers tokens whyther they shuld haue any hope to bring that mater to effect: for which they sacrifised or els nat.
And often tymes the wycked spyrites to cause them {per}seuer in their ydolatry: and to gyue crede~ce to that blynd er+rour shewed many toke~s to the~ insuch maner sacrifice: which tokens they often founde true.
The preest of the ydolles whiche sacrifysed for Marius shewed great and marueylous tokens vnto hym: wherby he myght greatly trust to come to his intent and purpose byddyng hym prosecute that thyng on whiche he had sette his mynde: and haue sure confydence in his goddes.
Sayng that if he wolde proue the extremite of fortune dilige~tly and often: than doutlesse euery thynge prosperously shulde happen to hym.
But Marius afore that tyme: longe season wonderously desyred in his mynde the dignite of the consull.
And to say trueth he wanted nothyng which longed to hym whiche shulde haue such a dignite saue onely antiquite of his progeny and auncient noblenesse of byrthe.
For thought he were but a gentylman of the first heed: neuerthelesse his co~dicions were worthy and excelle~t.
In hym was great experie~ce of wysdome, moche probite honestie and sadnesse.
He had great polycy and connyng in chyualry: in batayle his mynd was excellent bolde.
He desyred nor coueyted nothyng erthly saue glorie laude and worshyp.
This Marius was borne brought vp by all his chyldhode in the countrey of Champayne beyonde Frau~ce in a towne named Arpyne.
But assone as he was encreased so that he myght bere harnesse and byde the hardnesse of warfare: he concluded to lyue on the wages of chyualrie.
And in that study he exercysed hymselfe: and nat in eloquence of greke langage or in other study or science: nor yet in the superfluous aparayle nor carnall lustes of citezins vnto which he neuer subdued his body.
And thus was he indued with good maners: and excercysed among honest ocupacions and so continued that his hole and vndefyled with shortly encreased exalted himselfe growyng to honour and vertu.
First whan this Marius desyred of the co~menty of Rome to haue an office: that is to say to be ordayned protectour of the soudyours: many of the citezins knewe nat his persone: bycause he was alway from the cite in warre batayle: but his actes made his name well knowen.
Wherfore after that the co~menty vnderstode that he was Marius of whose nobles all Italy moch co~muned talked: anon they graunted his peticion and proclamed hym protectour of the soudyours ouer all the prouinces tribes of Italy.
In that maistership office he behaued hymselfe so well wysely that after that he obtayned an other office of more worshyp and authorite: and after that agayne an other of hyer dignite.
And shortly to speke: in euery office and dignite he so behaued hymselfe that euery man thought and counted hym worthyer of more dignite and honour than he had.
Howe beit for all these condicions: as honorable as he was: he durst neuer before desyre thoffice of consull of Rome tyll this tyme whan he had suche co~fort by his sacrifice.
But whan he was thus warned and put in hope and confort euer after he was hedelyng enclined to ambicion and couetyse of that dignite.
¶At this season the co~menty of Rome had all other offices among them or at their gyft and dystribucion.
But the estates and noble men kept among them and in their handes the consulshyp yerely one succedyng other by election.
So that of the commenty was none so noble nor excellent of dedes but that was reputed vnworthy of that dignite and as who sayth vyle and polluted.
But whan Marius sawe and consydred that the wordes and counsell of the enchauntour and preest which behelde his sacrifice pretended to the same poynt and conclusion as the desyre of his mynde moued hym longe before.
Anone he came to his capitayne Metellus besechyng hym to be dyscharged of the batayle tyll he myght go to Rome to thintent to desyre the consulshyppe of the senatours.
But how beit that in this Metellus was vertu glorie worshyp and all other thynges longynge to a good man plentifully ynoughe.
Neuerthelesse of his courage and mynde was he so~what proude despisyng dysdaynyng other: whiche were nat come of so hy lynage as he was.
But specially he was stately and proude of mynde: whiche is a co~men vyce and myschefe among estates and gentylmen.
Wherfore Metellus heryng this interprise of Marius first of all was moued with the newelty of his peticion.
For at that tyme were none wonte to speke for that dignite but if they were come of a noble stocke.
And thus Metellus marueyled moche at his enterpryse: and who myght counsell hym therto: warnynge hym as vnder colour of amyte and frendshyppe nat to presume vpon so contrary and vnlikely a thyng: nor to exalte his mynde so hy aboue fortune co~uenient for his state and co~dicion.
Sayng also to hym that euery thing was nat to be coueyted nor desyred of euery man.
And that it became hym well by reason to be co~tented pleased and satisfied with that honour whiche he had that was his owne and nat to desyre thyng{is} vnmete for his degre.
And finally he exhorted cou~selled hym to beware to desyre yt thing of the Romayns which laufully might be denyed vnto hym: co~sydring and hauyng regarde to his lynage ¶After Metellus had cou~selled Marius with these wordes and other lyke: and that he coude nat tourne nor apease his mynde he answered hym at last that assone as he coude co~uenie~tly (nat lettyng the besynesse of the co~men wele) he wolde grau~t his desyre peticion.
But after this whan desyred the same dyscharge importunely often: he made hym answere sayng that he shulde nat make so great hast to Rome for that purpose for he shuld come tymely ynough to demau~de that dignite aco~panyed with the sonne of the same Metellus whiche sonne shulde also go to Rome in tyme to come to demau~de of the senators the same dignite with Marius.
This sonne of Metellus was at that tyme in the army of his father Metellus co~tinually exercisyng the feates of warre nat withstandynge that he was but .xx. yere of age.
This answere of Metellus styred Marius agaynst hym with greuous yre wrath what for the honour whiche he desyred: and what for the licence to depart whiche he coude nat optayne of hym by no prayer nor request at his pleasure.
In somoche that he enraged agaynst Metellus moued by desyre of that office and prouoked by yre whiche two vices ambicion yre counselled and impelled this Marius to moch yll agaynst the sayd Metellus sparyng nouther worde nor dede whiche myght endamage or hynder hym his honour and name.
And that myght helpe or auaunce hymselfe by ambicion to come to the dignite whiche he desyred.
He gouerned the soudyours which passed forthe the wynter vnder his gouernaunce nat as he ought to do: but suffred them to haue their pleasure to thintent therby to optayne their fauour and goodwyll in his enterprise.
Also he spake often in blamyng Metellus proudly co~mendyng exaltyng hymselfe vnto the marchantes of Rome: of whome was great resort and co~cours to the sayd cite of Vtica where Marius soiourned.
And often tymes he boosted sayenge to them that if the one halfe of the army were graunted and co~mytted to hym within fewe dayes he wolde behaue hymselfe that he wolde haue Iugurth in bondes and subiection.
Fathermore he sayed to them in auancynge hymselfe that Metellus prolonged the batayle for the nonest for a craft bycause he was a man pompous and desyrous of glorie worshyp vtterly reioysinge in authorite and gyuen to pride and affection of dignite: and bycause he knewe well that whyle the ba+tayle continued he shuld be reputed in maner as a kyng therfore he dyd his deuoyre the more to prolonge the warre to thende that in the meane tyme he myght exalte and magnify hymselfe.
The wordes of Marius semed to the sayd marcha~tes certayne and true and also as they thought (by suche informacion) moost expedient to the commen wayle that some newe capitayne were chosen whiche shortly wolde finysshe that warre.
For by long contynuance of the same warre: many of the sayd marchantes had wasted spent moche of their substance and richesse.
And also to such desyrefull myndes as they had nothyng coude to fast be hasted or brought to ende.
¶Moreouer at this season was in company of the romayne army a certayne Numidyan named Gauda whiche was sonne of Manastaball: and neuewe vnto Massinissa.
Micipsa in his testament ordayned that this Gauda shulde be seconde heyre of Numidy after the deth of his two sonnes and of Iugurth.
This Gauda was sore enfebled with dyseases and syckenesse: and for that cause his mynde was a lytell endulled and priuate of reason and memorie.
Whyle this Gauda (as sayed is) was in the romayns army: he requyred of Metellus to suffre hym to haue his seat and siege next vnto hym after the vse of kynges of Numidy.
Also after that bycause of defence and garde of his body: he desyred that a com+pany of soudyours of the romayns myght be graunted and assigned to hym.
But Metellus extremely denyed bothe his peticions saynge for the first: that suche honour longed onely to them whome the romayns toke and named for kynges.
And also for ye seconde peticion he sayd that it were an vnauysed and iniurious ordina~ce if the romayne soudyours were gyuen or assigned to the garde and seruice of a Numidyan whiche was no kyng but a soudyour lyke many mo hyred for stypende.
Whyle Gauda was displeased and angry with Me+tellus for denyeng of these his peticions: Marius came to hym and prouoked hym to reuenge the displeasure iniury which the captayne had done to hym with his helpe auaunceme~t.
This Gauda (as haue sayd before) was of feble and vnstable mynde: and the mennes wytte was of lytell valoure by meanes of diseases which long had holden hym.
Wherfore Marius with his elegant fayre and flateryng wordes at his owne pleasure induced hym exalted his mynde sayeng that he was a kyng an excellent and great man: and also neuewe to the worthy noble kyng Massinissa.
Wherfore (sayd he) yf Iugurth were outher slayne or taken prisoner it wer lickely to co~e to that poynt: that the kyngdome of Numidy shulde be assigned co~mytted to hym of the senatours without any tary or resystence: whiche thyng shulde shortely be brought to passe yf Marius hymselfe were creat consull in place of Metellus than assigned to execute and finysshe the warre with Iugurth.
Vnder this maner Marius counselled and induced bothe the sayd Gauda the romayne knyghtes the co~men soudyours and also the marchauntes and occupyers whiche were in the towne at that season wt many other whome he impelled with his wordes so: that some of them for loue whiche they had to Marius: And other some for great hope and desyre which they had to haue peace and co~corde wrote to Rome to their kynsmen frendes of the batayle of Numidy that very sharpely agaynst Metellus desyring besechyng them to labour at Rome withall their myght that Marius myght be elect consull and assigned to execute the warre of Numidy.
And thus at Rome was the consulshyp desyred by many men with great fauour and very honest peticions for Marius.
Also at that tyme had the sayd Marius this auauntage.
For the co~mentie at that season deposed many of the states: eralted such as were newe gentylmen after the lawe of one na+med Manlius which before had ben {pro}tectour of the co~me~tie.
This Manlius ordeyned inacted a lawe that if any thyng were vngoodly done and agaynst ryght of the states beynge in any office or dignite: than he whiche so had done shulde be deposed of his office: and in his place some newe gentyll or actyue man of the co~mentie sette and deputed and so exalted.
This lawe at those dayes was kept in effect and executed at Rome: wherfore euery thyng proceded prosperously to the purpose profet of Marius.
For (as haue sayd before) in hym was no noblenesse of auncient lynage nor byrthe.
¶But here wyll leaue to speke of the ambicion of Marius and retourne to wryte of Iugurth: and howe he behaued hymselfe agaynst Metellus.
¶Howe Iugurth renewed the warre agaynste Metellus and how the numidyans inhabyters of the towne of Vacca by treason murdred the garnyson of romayns whiche Metellus had set in the same towne.
IN the meane tyme whan Iugurth had broken the co~posicion which he had before made with Metellus by cou~sell of Bomilchar and had co~cluded agayne to begyne the warre: than anone he prepared all thyng{is} necessary to warre with great diligence.
Moreouer he dayly troubled with thretnynges or feare or els with great rewardes: suche citees townes as befor had forsaken hym yelded themselfe to Metellus.
So that he spared no polycie to make them to render themselfe agayne to hym.
In such holdes townes as were in his possession: he set garnyson and defence of men of warre.
He renewed bought agayne armour wepyn and all other thyng{is} which he had lost before: or delyuerd to Metellus in hope of peace.
He attysed vnto hym many of the romayns subgettes bondemen: by promisyng to them their libertie.
He also proued attempted wt rewardes them: whome Metellus had set assigned in garnyson garde and defence of such places as he had wonne in Numidy: so that vtterly be suffred nothyng to be left quyet nor vnassayed: but by all maner meanes made prouysion for hymselfe mouyng puttyng in profe euery thynge.
But amonge all other thinhabitantes of the cite called Vacca (in whiche Metellus at begynynge had set his garnison: whan Iugurth first sought his peace of Metellus) were desyred often of Iugurth and with great importune instance exited to treason.
In somoche that at last they assented to hym to co~spire agaynst the romayns.
Thinhabitantes of the cite dyd nat yelde themselfe from Iugurth with their owne goodwyll: and namely thestates and rulers therof dyd neuer yelde them to Metellus saue faynedly.
Wherfore specially they were the first that conspired agaynst hym secretely amonge themselfe.
For why as it often happened the commentie and specially of the Numidiens were vnstable of mynde vtterly enclined to sedicion and discorde couetous of newe thynges and changes: and contrary to rest and quyetnesse.
But (as haue sayd before) whan the chyfe of this cite had secretly concluded and apoynted their mater and treason amonge themselfe: agaynst the thyrde day they ordayned that the same thyrde day nexte after shulde be commaunded solem holy and worshypped ouer all the countrey of Affrike and Numidy.
Whiche day shewed and pretended by all similytude myrth game and sport: rather than any drede to the romayns whiche were in garde and gernison of the cyte.
But the Numidyens full of prodicion and treason whan they sawe their tyme called vnto their houses all the chefe captayns and maister soudyours of the romayns whiche were in the towne.
And also one named Turpilius: whome Metellus had ordayned to be his lyeutenant prouost and chife capitayne of the towne: they enuited and called as yf it had ben to chere and feest them one to one house an other to an other.
But this there was suche as the Scorpyon is wont to make: whiche whyle she maketh glad semblant with her mouthe mortally styngeth with the tayle: so this feest was a cloke to mortall treason.
For whyle the romayns were in myddes of their daynties vnarmed suspectynge no paryll.
All the Numidiens at a tokens gyuen and at one houre apoynted before slewe eche one his geest whiche dyned with hym without fauoure: so that amonge them all escaped nat one except the sayd Turpilius heed capitayne or lyeutenant of the towne.
This done: all the Numidyens togyder set vpon the remenant of the co~men soudyours whiche wandred and strayed abrode in the towne in the stretes dispersed abrode without any armour: as is wont on suche a day without order feryng nor doutyng no daunger.
Some of the co~mens whan thestates had made them pryue of this treason came also to helpe them and some other ignorant of the mater sauyng that that they had desyre and pleasure in suche murder inuaded the romayns also.
For though they were ignorant of the counsell of this dede: yet the noyse or skirmysshe and newelty of the mater pleased them ynough.
The romayn soudyours were ignorant and incertayne of this vnprouided feare and cruell murder doutynge what was best to be done.
Their ennemies co~pasynge them on euery syde letted them to go to the castell of the towne where their armoure and wepyn was: and the gates of the towne were shet on euery syde before this skyrmysshe began wherby they were prohibyted to auoyde the towne.
Moreouer women children thrue downe vpon them stones and other thynges that came next to hande from the wyndowes hyest partes of their houses: stryuyng who myght throwe first most.
Thus this doutfull and vnprouided mychefe coude nat be eschued: nor they which were ryght worthy strong soudyours were nat able to resyst the very cowardyse and feblenes of women and chyldren whiche thrue downe vpon them.
Thus both good and yll worthy vnworthy strong feble: were all slayne without difference.
In this so great ieopardy: the Numidyens beyng mad and cruell in murdre and the gates shette on euery syde: of all the romayns or Italyens: onely Turpilius the captayne escaped without hurt of his body.
Whyther it so happed by the fauour of his hoost whiche called hym to banket: or by some apoyntment of treason: or els by some other chance: it was nat knowen for certayn.
But this was knowen that euer after as long as he lyued he was reputed for a vyle and a wretched cowarde without crede~ce· bycause that in so great losse myschefe he cou~ted it better to escape: and after to lyue and dye in shame and rebuke: than manly to haue dyed in defence of the towne.
And euer after to haue had an honorable name of a worthy capitayne.
¶How Metellus destroyed the towne of Vacca and slewe all the inhabitauntes in reuengynge their treason.
And howe Tupilius lyeutenaunt or captayne of towne was beheded at commau~dement of Metellus.
WHan Metellus vnderstode of this lamentable chance treason downe at the towne of Vacca: his mynde was meruaylously greued abasshed sadde withall.
But to thintent that none shulde parceyue his heuynesse he withdrue hymselfe frome company a lytell tyme: but after whan he had satisfied his mynde with teares and secrete lamentacion.
And whan his dolour was myxed with wrath and displeasure agaynst that cruell dede: than hasted he hymselfe with great cure diligence to go reuenge this iniurious and cruell treason.
Anone he called forth a legion of soudyors whiche passed forthe the wynter with hym: and with them also as many horsmen of the Numidyens as he myght assemble whiche had forsaken Iugurth and fled to hym: whome he thought most trusty.
His legion he arayed in lyght harnesse and easy armour to thinte~t to spede the way more redely.
And by cause he entended to go about this mater secretly: therfore priuely euyn with the sonne goyng downe he toke his iournay {pro}ceded forwarde towarde Vacca: and laboured so that on the next day after about the thyrde houre he came with his co~pany into a certayne playne a lytell closed or co~pased about with small downys nat moch hyer than the extremitees of the valey.
There called he togyder his soudyours whiche were wery for the great labour of their iourney: and longe way which they had gone.
But Metellus conforted them sayeng that the towne of Vacca was no more but one myle thens.
Wherfore he desyred them to suffre endure the remena~t of their labour with pacyent myndes but onely tyll reuenged the deth of the citezins their felowes which were strong worthy men: and very miserably murdred.
Moreouer he shewed to them benygnely the great pray which was redy for them if they wolde manly {pro}cede.
Thus were their myndes exalted co~forted and enbolded with his wordes.
Metellus seynst that: was glad anone co~maunded the horsmen to {pro}cede in the forward these horsmen were numidyens.
And the fotemen he co~maunded to kepe secrete their standerdes conysances and badges: and to go behynde vnder the shadowe of the horsemen as nere togyder as they myght: and so proceded he towarde the towne.
¶Whan the citezyns sawe an army approche and moue towarde them: at the begynnynge they thought it had ben Metellus (as it was in dede) and onone shytte the gates of the towne agaynst hym.
But afterwarde whan they aduysed them well: and sawe that the company which approched made no deuastacion nor distruction by the feldes nor countrey as they went.
And also wha~ they parceyued that the horsmen whiche were in the forwarde were Numidyens: agayne they thought that it was Iugurth with his company.
Wherfore with great ioy they issued forthe of the towne to mete hym.
Metellus anone parceyued their ignorance and gaue a token to his people to assayle them.
The horsmen and fotemen knowynge the wyll of their captayne by blast of the tru~pettes assayled and ouerthrue the co~mentie which came out of the cite agaynst them dis{per}sed ouer the feldes.
Some of the romains ran to the gates of the towne entred without resistence: and some toke inuaded the towres of the walles maugre the kepars.
Thus the dispeasure yre whiche the romayns had for deth of their felowes: the hope of prayes of the towne ouercame excluded their werynes which they had in their iournay thyderwarde.
Thus the inhabitantes of Vacca enioyed their treason but onely two dayes.
For onely the space of two dayes co~tinued their falshode crueltie vnreuenged.
For that great riche cyte was all gyuen to hauocke murdre vtterly distroyed of the romayns: so that no creature escaped alyue to boost of their treason before co~mitted agaynst the romains whome they had so trayterously slayne within their cite.
Turpilius lyetenant or captayne of the towne whiche (as haue sayd before) escaped onely with his lyfe: was called befo+re Metellus and co~maunded to answere for hymselfe by what way or meanes he escaped whyther by treason done to the towne or by any other policy.
But bycause he coude but simply excuse nor pourge hymselfe of that whiche was layed agaynst hym he first was scourged beaten: and after that his heed stryken of from his sholders for that it was thought that if he had nat betrayed the cite he coude nat haue escaped more than any other.
Farthermore that great dystruction of the romains was ascribed to his neglige~ce or treason.
If this Turpilius had ben a romayn he shulde nat haue put to deth.
For the lawe of Porcius prohibyted any citezine of Rome to be slayne: but if they co~mytted any great offence the extreme punysshement by the lawe was to co~myt them to exyle.
But this Turpilius inioyed nat the priuyleges of this lawe: for asmoche as he was no citezyne of Rome but an Italyan of the towne of Collace.
¶Howe Bomylchar conspyred treason agaynst Iugurth and by what meanes this treason was discouered and Bomilchar with certayne other put to deth for the same.
AT the same tyme Bomilchar (by whose counsell and mocyon Iugurth before had begon the co~posicion with Metellus which he omitted and brake agayn for feare) was co~uersant with Iugurth whiche alytell suspected this Bomilchar of treason.
Wherfore he suspectyng hym agayne ymagyned newe policy agaynst Iugurth dayly sekynge deuysing some gyle to his dystruction and deth so that in dyuerse deuyses there about his mynde wandred and was weryed both day nyght.
But whan he had assayed many wayes and that nothing came to purpose: he adioyned vnto hym an other co~panyon named Nabdalsa a noble man exalted enhaunced with great rychesse: and moche beloued of his co~mentie and people of whome he had rule.
This Nabdalsa was so well beloued with Iugurth that often tymes he co~mytted to hym an army power by hymselfe to execute all other thyng{is} whiche longed to meane besynesse whyle Iugurth hymselfe was weryed or lette with other gretter thynges: wherby the sayd Nabdalsa had optayned great honour gathered great rychesse.
Thus at co~clusion: by apoynteme~t counsell bothe of Bomilchar of Nabdalsa a day was prefixed betwene them to execute their treason agaynst Iugurth.
And in the meane tyme they {pro}uyded euery thyng to that purpose as the matter and case requyred.
Nabdalsa went to the army whiche Iugurth had co~mytted to hym for to tary with the same nere to those places where the romayns wyntred: to thintent that if the romayns wasted or distroyed the cou~trey.
Nabdalsa with his co~pany shulde other prohibet them: or els so dystourbe them that they shulde nat escape vnreuenged.
But whan the tyme apoynted drewe nere: than was Nabdalsa so abasshed for the gretnesse of the dede that he mette nat with Bomilchar at the day tyme assigned.
But wha~ Bomilchar was thus disapoynted of his partyng felowe he was greatly abasshed: neuerthelesse his mynde was moch desyrous to perfourme his enterprise.
But agayne he was doutfull for this cowardouse fere of his co~panyon: lest he wolde omytte their first apoyntment and counsell and begyn some other newe apoyntme~t.
Wherfore he letters vnto hym by trusty frendes and partyners of the same treason.
In which letters he sharpely blamed the pacyence delayeng and cowardyse of Nabdalsa and vnstablenesse of his mynde obtestyng and callyng vnto wytnes the goddes by whome he had sworne to {per}fourme the sayd treason.
Moreouer he warned hym that he sholde nat tourne to their dystruction and co~+fusyon: the great rewardes whiche they bothe myght haue of Metellus.
Which thyng truly shuld fortune if Metellus hym selfe shulde bring Iugurth into captiuyte.
Farthermore Bo+mylchar in the same letters gaue monicion to Nabdalsa that thende of Iugurth was nere come: and that it was nat possyble that he might long contynewe all thynges co~sydred.
But than was the mater in hande whyther he shulde be destroyed by them or els by Metellus.
Wherfore he exhorted hym well to consyder in mynde whyther he had leuer betray hym and therby optayne great fauour and rewardes: or els to leaue of tyll Metellus ouercame hym: and than to be put to deth also with hym.
¶These exhortacions with other lyke were contayned in the letters of Bomilchar dyrected vnto Nabdalsa.
But whan these letters were delyuerd: as chaunce was: Nabdalsa lay on his bed to recreate and refresshe his body weryed with labour and besynesse which he had taken before.
Whan Nabdalsa had red these letters and vnderstode the mynde of Bomilchar: first many deuyses entred his mynde and moch cure he had in musyng what was moost expedient to be done in the cause.
But whyle he was in this study: sodenly he fell in a slombre and his wery membres desyring rest moued hym to fall in slepe.
This Nabdalsa had a seruant longynge to hym whome he moche loued and trusted: in somoche that no besynesse nor cou~sell he hydd nor kept secret from hym: this counsell of betrayng of Iugurth onely except.
Whan this seruant vnderstode that the sayd letters were brought to his lorde he thought that he had nede of his counsell as he was wont and acustomed to haue in other maters: and anone entred in to the tent where his maister lay.
And seyng hym fast in slepe he toke the letters whiche Nabdalsa had vnwysely layd aboue his heed vpon the pyllowe: and seyng by the superscripcion that the letter came from Bomilchar he redd it to thende.
But whan he vnderstode the treason: in all hast he addressed hym with the same letter to Iugurth.
Nabdalsa nat longe after awakenyd and myssed the letter wherfore anone he enquyred who had ben there in his tent.
But in short season came dyuers of his louers from Iugurth which certifyed hym of all the mater as it was done.
Nabdalsa first of all entended to pursue his accuser: but whan he perceyued that it was but in vayne so to do consydring that he was all redy in the company of Iugurth: he went vnto Iugurth hymselfe to thintent to pacify and mytigate his displeasure wrath.
And sayd vnto hym that whan the sayd letters were first delyuerd vnto hym he had fully purposed nat to kepe them secret: but hymselfe to haue disclosed them to Iugurth.
But whyle he was slepyng his false seruant (in hope to be aduansed therby) had preuented hym his purpose done the same thyng which he himselfe had fully purposed to do.
Farthermore wepyng he besought required hym for all amyte and loue whiche had ben bytwene them for all the faythfull seruice whiche he had done to hym in foretyme nat to haue hym suspected in so cruell a dede.
Iugurth answered to these requestes of Nabdalsa myldly soberly lest any gretter variance myght ryse therof: but moche co~trary to the disposicion of his mynd
For he thought otherwyse than he answered: howe beit he had well refrayned and alayed his wrath before wt the deth of Bomilchar of many other whome he knewe first deuisours partynge felowes of that treason whome he had caused to be put to deth before the co~myng of Nabdalsa: lest some batayle or other insurrection shuld haue {pro}ceded of ye besinesse if they had lyued any lenger.
¶From this day forwarde Iugurth was neuer quyet day nor nyght: so that he trusted nouther place nother man nor tyme: but suspected mystrusted euery thyng.
His ennemies and his owne subgettes he dreded and suspected both in lyke after one maner.
He sherched espyed euery place for drede of treason doutyng suspectyng euery sound or noyse that he herde.
He rested and lay some nyght in one place and some nyght in an other and that in abiect secrete places agaynst the honoure of his estate royall.
Somtyme he rose from his bed in his slepe in myddes of the nyght and armed hymselfe cryng enragyng and violently smyting agaynst the walles of the chambre: as if he had ben in batayle.
So that for the great drede of treason whiche he had he toke no rest nother slepyng nor wakyng: but was violently vexed and fered lyke a mad man without reason or discression.
¶How Metellus renued the warre agaynst Iu+gurth: and howe Marius was creat consull and assigned to execute the warre of Numidy at plea+sure of the co~mens agaynst the wyll of all the no+ble men of Rome.
WHan Metellus by such as fled bitwene the two parties vnderstode of the chance of Bomilchar and of this treason disclosed he began than agayne to co~tende wt Iugurth: with open warre and therto hasted all thyng necessary and expedient.
And considryng that Marius was co~tinually cryeng on hym for the sayd licence and congy to depart to Rome and also greuous hatefull and contrary to hym: aduysynge hym nat moche necessary but lytell mete i~ so sharpe a besynes.
And seyng hym yll wyllyng to euery thyng he graunted hym lyce~ce at last: to departe toward Rome as he before had often requyred and demaunded by peticion.
¶But as haue sayd longe before the letters whiche were sende to Rome to the co~mens by fauourers of Marius were well accepted.
For whan the co~mentie had ouersene them and by them vnderstode the praysyng of Marius the dispraysyng of Metellus.
They were all inclined vtterly to the auau~ceme~t of Marius detraccion of the other.
The noblenes of Metellus the capitayne whiche was before to his great worshyp honour tourned nowe to enuy hatered agaynst hym.
But the lownes vnnoblenes of Marius encreased to hym fauour specially of the co~mentie which were come of vnnoble blode as he was.
But the diligence fauour of both the parties (that is to say of thestates which helde with Metellus: of the co~mens that helde with Marius) dyd measure gyde euery thynge rather than the good or yll disposicions of the two aduersaryes Metellus or Marius.
For the commens to dy for it concluded to exalte Marius.
And the estates in the same maner laboured to kepe hym vnder bycause he was vnnoble borne and to exalte none saue them which were come of noble progeny.
Farthermore the maisters and heed officers of the co~mentie which loued debate at euery assemble and co~gregacion of the co~menssore blamed Metellus and dispised his dedes desyring of the co~mens that Metellus might be put to the punysshe of his heed sayng that he was so worthy: for that he {pro}longed the warr in Numidy agaynst Iugurth more than nede was.
But in dispisyng and accusyng Metellus they forgat nat to co~mende Marius and exalt hym with wor+des som what to moche: and more than he was worthy in many poyntes.
In somoche that the people were so greatly encly+ned to hym with their fauoure: that all the crafty men and labourers of the cite: and also of the countrey whiche had no lyuyng saue in the labour of their handes left their warke and and folowed Marius frequentyng and resortyng to his company.
And sette more by his auauncement and honour than by their owne profet or aduauntage trustyng that after yf he optayned the sayd honoure: they shulde haue their lyuenge by hym.
And thus shortly to speke the estates and noble men of Rome beynge sore astonyed the consulshyp was co~mytted to Marius a newe gentylmen whose predecessours before hym to such dignite coude neuer attayne were counted vnworthy.
Thus that thynge whiche many yeres before that tyme coude neuer be done nor brought about: was nowe brought to effect: that is to say the consulshyp which was the most excellent dignite of Rome was nowe in handes of the commentie co~mytted to a man of basse byrth.
Shortly after this: the protectour of the co~mentie named Lucius Manlius enquyred demaunded of the people whome it wolde please them to sende into Numidy to finysshe the warre with Iugurgth.
The most part of the co~mentie answered that Marius shulde haue that office besynesse: how beit a lytell before that tyme the senatours had assigned by their ordinaunce the prouince of Numidy to Metellus for his worthy dedes: wherfore nowe this ordinaunce was frustrate voyde.
¶Of the seconde batell foughten bytwene Metellus and Iugurth: and howe Iugurth lost the batayle and also one of his chiefe townes named Thala.
IN the meane tyme whyle the interprise of Marius proceded thus forwarde at Rome: Iugurth was sore troubled i~ his mynde for many co~sideracions.
First he consydred the losse of many whome he reputed for his frendes tyll before he knewe their treason of whom he had many put to deth and many other had fled from hym for feare some to the romayns and other some to Bocchus kynge of the mauriens.
He called also to his mynde that without ministers an men of warre he was nat able to execute the warre: and more ouer he thought it ieopardous after so great falshode and treason of his olde to proue or assay the fidelite of newe.
For these causes and mo lyke (as haue sayd before) his mynde was driuen to and fro variable incertayne in diuers opynions.
Insomoch that there was no maner thyng no cou~sell nor no maner man: that coude sufficiently satisfy nor please his mynde.
He changed his iournayes and wayes euery day into sondry places for feare of treson.
Somtyme he addressed hym towarde his ennemies: and anone after retourned into wodes wyldernesses.
Often tymes he had trust co~fidence in flyght: and anone after put his trust in armour batayle.
He douted whyther he myght lesse trust to strength or trueth of his men which were with hym: so that what euer he purposed to do: or whyther so euer he intended euery thynge was co~trary to hym.
But whyle Iugurth thus prolonged and taryed: sodenly Metellus with his army appered in his syght.
Iugurth that parceyuyng: set in order and array his numidye~s aswell as he might aft the short tyme which he had therto.
In that part of the batayle where Iugurth hymselfe was: they stroue and resysted a lytell space: but all the other numidyens at the first brunt concourse or assaut were put to flyght with violence and driuen backwarde.
The romayns toke some of their standerdes and armour which they fleyng away left behynde them: but of their ennemies they toke but fewe.
For the Numidiens in that batayle and almoost in all other defended themselfe better with their fete: tha~ with their handes or armoure.
Iugurth at this tyme: mystrusted his case moche more than at any other tyme euer before for the cowardous withdrawyng of his people.
Wherfore he aco~panyed hymselfe with the romayns which had forsaken and betrayed Metellus fled to hym.
With them and with a part of his horsmen he fled into the wyldernesses therby: and from thens vnto a towne named Thala which was a great towne a and moch of his treasour of the aparell longyng to the yongth of his yong chyldren was in the same towne.
But whan Metellus vnderstode that Iugurth was fled to so ryche a towne how beit he knewe that bytwene the towne and the next flod therto was .l. mylespace of dry grou~d voyde without habitacion: neuerthelesse he toke in hande to ouercome all sharpnesse and difficultie of places: and also to ouercome nature though it semed impossible to mannes mynde.
This thynge Metellus toke in hande in hope to fynisshe the batayle moche soner yf he myght wynne that towne.
¶Wherfore he co~maunded that all the beestes whiche serued for cariage shulde be vnladen of all suche baggage and burthens as they caried longynge to the soudyours: saue onely whete and vitayle for the space of .x. dayes.
Also he co~mau~ded some of the beestes to be laded with bottels full of water and other vessels mete to be caryed with water.
Moreouer: ouer all the contrey he gathered togyder as many tame beestes as he coude get and them laded with empty vessels of euery sort.
Many of them were treen vessell which he had done to be gathered among the villages of the Numidiens.
Farthermore he co~maunded thinhabitantes of those marches whiche after the flight of Iugurth had yelded them to hym that they shuld make them redy to folowe the hoost euery man with asmoche water as they myght beare.
And assigned them a daye and place where they shulde be redy vnder payne of dethe.
Whan Metellus was come to the sayd flod whiche was fyfty myle from the towne of Thala and nerest water therto (as haue sayd before) he dyd all the beestes to be laded of the same water.
And so went towarde Thala his hoost set in order and aray: so that yf any ieopardy apered he was euer redy at defe~ce but afterwarde whan he was come to that place where he had apoynted the numidiens to mete hym with the water wherwith they were laded and folowed the hoost.
And whan his tentes were pytched sette and defended about with trenches cutte trees bowes and stakes after the policy of warre: sodenly from the heuen descended great violence and plenty of rayne water that it was more than sufficiently to all the army aswel to men as beestes.
Moreouer their vitels were more ple~tyfull than they trusted or loked after.
For the numidie~s which newly were yelded were somoche the more seruisable and redy to mynistre euery thynge necessary vnto the army.
And no maruell: for euery thyng is quycke at the begynnyng which often fadeth at the ende.
But the soudyours and men of warre: wer more glad to ocupy the rayne water for deuocion than suche water whiche was brought vnto them in vessels by caryage.
For they supposed that their goddes loued and fauoured them whiche in so drye a countrey and in suche a chau~ce sent to them so great plenty of water besyde prouision of ther captayne.
This thyng greatly conforted the myndes of them all: and incouraged them with boldnesse strength diligence: to ouercome all difficulties whiche remayned.
This confort kyndlyng their myndes: they spedde themselfe so forwarde that on the next day aft they came vnto the towne of Thala: co~trary vnto the opinion or knoledge of Iugurth.
Thinhabitantes which thought themselfe surely defended by the sharpnesse and difficultie of the place were sodenly abasshed astonyed for that great vnwont and vnprouided case.
Neuerthelesse they made prouision to batayle as quyckely as they myght by sufferau~ce of the tyme.
But the kynge Iugurth anone cast in his mynde that to Metellus was nothing vnprouided nor vnable to be done: as he that by his craft diligence and polycie: had ouercome both wepen armour place and tyme.
And also nature itselfe: whiche ruleth other thynges longyng vnto men.
Iugurth this aduysing reuoluyng in his mynde fled priuely by nyght forth of the towne with his children and a great part of his treasour.
Nor after this tyme he neuer taryed in one place past the space of a daye or of one nyght faynyng that he fled so from one place to an other bycause of his present besynesse: but the ryght cause of his remouynge was for that he feared treason which he thought best to auoyd and eschue by continuall chaungyng of places.
For suche counsels of treason can nat be taken without deliberacion and processe of tyme and conueniens or oportunyte of places where princes dothe long so iourne and continue.
¶But whan Metellus sawe that thinhabitantes were redy to batayle and also that the towne was strongly defended bothe by crafte of mannes handes and by nature of the place.
Anone he compased about the towne on euery syde with profounde dychesse trenches and herdels: of sharpe stakes the poyntes vpwarde to thentent that none of thinhabytantes shuld breke out nor escape by night as Iugurth had done before: nor that no vitels shulde be conuayed into them wherby they myght the lengar resyst hym and indure the sege.
Afterwarde he co~maunded scaffoldes to be made about the walles specially in suche places as were moost conuenient: and pentyses of sheldes conioyned in maner of vynes to be driuen to the walles vpon wheles.
And aboue the sayd scaffoldes to be cast a hepe of grauell and stones: and toures of tymbre and bulwarkes set vpon them: and other soudyours he assigned to defende the warke and them also that laboured therevpon.
These scaffoldes pentyses and pauases: were made to thentent that vnder them the romayns might vndermine the walles without great paryll or dammage.
On the othersyde the garnyson and inhabitantes hastely laboured to resyst the romayns to defende themselfe and their towne manfully.
So that on bothe parties was nothyng forgoten able to be done touchyng their defence.
But brefely to speke the romayns weryed with moch labour and batayle .xl. dayes after they were co~e thyder: at last wan the towne.
But all the pray and riches of the towne was distroyed by them whiche were within the towne in garnyson: of the romayns whiche had fled from Metellus to Iugurth: which specially had assigned them to defende the towne.
These traytours whan they sawe the walles vndermined brused with diuerse ingens of batayle: and their fortune was brought to extremite: and no socours nor hope remayned.
Than they assembled caried togyder all the treasour riches of the towne as golde syluer with other precious ornamentes or iewels into the palays of Iugurth there fylled themselfe with wyne and other delycate meates.
And at co~clusion whan they were full saturate and ingorged: they sette fyre on the palays and wylfully brent and distroyed the richesse the palays and themselfe withall.
So that suche punysshement as they dreded to suffre of their ennemies they voluntarily suffred the same with their owne ha~des to auoyd the subieccion and daunger of their ennemies: by desperate folly and presumptuous madnesse.
¶How Metellus fortified the cite of Leptis and at request of the embassadours of the same cytie sende thyder garnyson to defe~de the cyte agaynst Iugurth: and of the sytuacion of the same cyte behauour of thi~habytant{is} therof.
AT the same tyme whanne Thala was wonne of the romayns embassadors ca~e fro~ a towne of Numidy named Leptis vnto Metellus requirynge hym to sende thyder socours of garnison a capitayne to defende them from the oppression and iniury of a certayne noble and debatefull man which was within that cyte named Amylchar which (as they sayd) co~tinually laboured for newe chang{is} excityng and mouyng the co~men people to forsake the romayns agayne.
In so moch that agaynst the sayd Amylchar no man was able to resyst nor to preuayle: for he set nought by co~mau~deme~t of their officers and rulers nor yet by the auncient lawes of their cite At co~clusion these embassadors sayd to Metellus for a surete that except he graunted their peticion that bothe their owne helthe and also the frendes louers of thempire whiche were within that cite shulde be in great danger and paryll.
¶These Leptitans at begynnyng of this warre of Iugurth requyred frendshyppe with the romayns of Calphurnius of whome is made mencion in begynnyng of this hystorie.
And after that they sende to Rome vnto all the senatours requyryng the same amyte and peace to be confermed of them: whiche thynge was graunted to them gladly.
Therfore from thenfforth they euer contynued good and faythfull to the romayns: and worthely and substa~cially dyd euery thyng whiche was co~maunded vnto them by Calphurnius by Albinus or by Metellus.
For this consyderacion they lyghtly optayned all their desyre of Metellus whiche at their request sent forth with them vnto the sayd towne of Leptis: foure cohortes of lombardes chosen out of all his army with whome he sent to be captayne ouer them a noble knyght of his army named Caius Annius whome he also assigned to be lyeutenant of the towne.
¶This towne of Leptis was buylded first of all by the Sidonians which (as we rede) fled from their owne contrey for discorde and variance which fell among their cities at home.
Which Sidonians came in shyppes into the coostes of Affri+ke: where at last they buylded this cite of Leptes which is situate bytwene two quickesandes of whome the cite hath his name.
¶For about thextreme partes of Affrike be .ii. breckes of the see nere togyder nat lyke of quantite: but lyke of nature.
Of which two breekes those partes which be nerest vnto the land ar very profounde and depe with hye bankes of sande on euery syde.
But the other places nat nere vnto the lande be somtyme depe: somtyme shalowe after the dysposytion of the wether.
For whan the see begynneth in ragyng to be great and tempestyous by mouynge of the wynde than the waues of ye see draweth forth of the same places the slyme grauell and great stones: which in cawine wether were gathered togyder before in the same places.
And thus the facyon aspecte and regarde of the same places is mutable and changed at euery tempest and great wynde.
¶The langage of the cite of Leptis is nowe chaunged from the langage of Sydom into numidian langage by mariag{is} of the numidians.
But their lawes their apparell and maners (for the most part) styll foloweth the custome of sydoni which they me~tayned kept styll: somoche the more easely: by+cause they dwelled seperat in the extreme and vtter partes of the countrey farre from the court frequentacion of kynges of numidy.
For bytwene this cyte of Leptis and the wele inhabited partes of numidy be many places deserte and wyldernesses vnhabyted for drienes of the contrey.
¶The discripcion of that place of Affrike which is named the Phelen auters: and for what cause the sa~e place was first so named.
The .xlvi. cha. BVt for asmoche as by occasyon of this besynes of the cyte of Lept{is} and their embassadours haue made mencyon of their cyte and partly discrybed the sytuacion of ye same.
Nowe me thynketh it thyng conuenient and nat vnworthy to recount an excellent and meruaylous dede done in the same coostes by two brethern borne of the cite of Carthage and namely bycause the place is called the Phylene auters me thynketh it requisyte to declare the cause of that denominacion.
¶What tyme the Carthagine~ses had in possession and were lordes ouer the moost part of Affryke: at the same season the Cirenenses also were great and famous of name: and abundant of welth and richesse.
Than betwene the coostes of these two cities was a great large felde all ouer spred with sande without diuision perticion or difference.
But bytwene them was neyther nor mountayne whiche myght discerne the boundes marches of bothe their coostes: which thyng caused co~tinuall longe warre often and great batayls bytwene both parties.
But after that many armies on both sydes wer ouercome slayne or put to flyght both by lande by see and whan both peoples had somwhat wasted the one the other by spoylyng murdre: than began they to perceyue their owne foly on both partes feryng lest some other nacion anone after shuld assayle them both the ouercomers and them that were ouercome whan they were wasted weryed with batayls and brought to extremite: Wherfore this co~sydred: they toke truys bytwene them bothe to auoyed that long variance bytwene them: they made agreme~t co~uenant that messangers or embassadours of bothe parties shulde depart out of their cities at one certayne day and houre assigned.
And that same place where the messangers of both the cities shulde mete togyder: shulde be for euer after taken for the boundes and marches of the cou~trey of both the nacions cities without more contencion or variance.
To bryng this apoyntme~t to effect conclu+syon forth of the cite of Cyren were chosen two for their part and sende forth at the day houre apoynted.
And in lykewyse out of Carthage were send two breterne eche of them named Phylene which swyftly sped them in their iourney.
But the Cyrene~ses went moch more slowly whether it so fortuned by neglige~ce or chau~che knowe but lytell the trueth.
But this is knowen for certayne that about those coostes tempeste of wynde weder is wont to let men and {pro}long their iourney in lykewyse as vpon the see: and that for this cause.
For whan by those euyn places wyde bare wtout any thing growynge on them: the wynde ryseth styreth the small sande from the grou~de: the same sande moued by great violence of the wynd is wont to fyll the faces mouthes and eyen of such as passeth that way with dust sande.
And thus often by lettyng of their syght: their iournay is {pro}longed hyndred.
But after whan the Cyrenenses sawe themselfe somwhat ouerflowe late in their iournay: they fered punysshement at their retournynge home for their neglige~ce.
And blamyng they accused the Carthaginenses obiectyng sayeng that they had come forth of their cite before the tyme assigned: and thus they troubled all the mater brake the ordynance.
But shortly to speke these Ci+renenses co~cluded rather to suffre deth and to do any thynge possible than to retourne home agayn ouerco~e.
Wherfore the Carthaginenses desyred some other co~dicion or apoyntment to be made indiffere~t equall bytwene both the parties.
The Cirene~ses co~sented therto put the Carthagine~ses in choyse whyther they wold be quicke buryed in that same place whiche they desyred for their marches and bou~des: or els that the Cirenenses vnder the same co~dicion shulde {pro}cede forwarde to that place whiche they desyred for their marches and there to be quicke buryed vnder the same maner.
The .ii. bretherne both named Phylene alowed and graunted the co~dicion subduyng abandonyng their bodyes to deth for the profet and wele of their contrey cite of Carthage: and so were they buryed quicke.
Wherfore the Carthaginenses in the same place where they were buryed raysed halowed .ii. auters in worshyp reme~brance of these two brethern which set more by encrese of their contrey: than by their owne lyues.
These auters to this prese~t day be called the Phylene auts after the name of the .ii. brethern named Phylenis therunder buryed as sayd is for wele of their contrey: also besyde this memorial wtin the cite of Carthage were many other thing{is} ordayned to ye gret honour of them remembrance of their worthy dede.
¶But nowe wyll leaue this mater reteurne to my purpose.
¶How Iugurth assembled a newe army of the rude getulyans agaynst the romayns: and how he associated vnto hym Bocchus kynge of the Mauriens to strengthe hym in batayle agaynst Metellus.
WHan Iugurth had lost the citie of Thala one of the strongest cities of his lande (as sayd is before) than he consydred well that in all his kyngdome was no place stronge ynough to resyst the myght of Metellus.
Wherfore he hasted hym with a small co~pany through desertes and great wylder+nesse fleyng from his owne contrey.
And at last he came to the lande of Getulians whiche is a maner of people rude wylde without order or maners: and at that season nought knowyng of the preemyne~t honour fame of the romayne empire.
Of this people Iugurth assembled a multitude togyder and by lytell lytell enduced taught them by custome and exercyse to folowe the order of chyualry: to kepe array to insue their standerdes to obey the co~maundementes of their capitayns to discerne and haue knowlege of the signifiaunce of soundes of trumpettes: and to obserue all other poyntes belongyng to warfare chyualry.
These thyng{is} with otherlike necessary to batayle Iugurth ceassed nat to prepare and ordayne with all diligence.
¶Moreouer he prouoked vnto his fauour and felowshyp by great rewardes moch gretter promises suche as were most nere frendes to Bocchus kyng of the maurie~s: by whose helpe he hymselfe went to the kyng Bocchus moche desyred hym in his quarell with hym to warre agaynst the romayns.
To this request of Iugurth Bocchus agreed somoch the more for asmoche as at first begynnynge of the same warre: this Bocchus sent vnto Rome embassadours to desyre of the romayns amyte and a bonde of co~tinuall peace bytwene hym them.
But nat withstandyng that this peticion peace was moche expedie~t necessary to the romayns for diuerse co~sideracions and namely bycause of this warre.
Nat the lesse it was nat grau~ted by meane of a fewe such as at Rome blynded wt auarice: were wont to sell for money euery thyng both honest and dishonest.
Also befor this tyme the doughter of Iugurth was spoused to the sayed Bocchus.
But this bonde of frendshyp of affinite among the numidi~es mauriens: is reputed but of effect: bycause they ar wont euery man to haue diuerse many wyues acordyng to their substa~ce richesse.
Some .x. and some mo: after as they ar of abylite or power to me~tayne.
But the kyng{is} bycause they ar of most power substa~ce: therfore haue they mo than an other.
Thus is their mynde and fa+uour distract diuersly deuyded from all their wyues for the multitude of the~: and bycause they haue so many so that they reserue none for their speciall bed felowe.
Wherfore they all ar reputed vyle lytell set by: after one maner.
Thus the affinite bytwene these two kyng{is} Iugurth Bocchus was lytell set by and small thyng auayled in this besynesse.
Nat withstandynge both they their hoostes ca~e togyder in a place apoynted therto: where after that they had gyuen taken fayth and trueth one to other of fidelite to be obserued bytwene them Iugurth greatly inhau~ced lyfted vp the mynde of Bocchus with his wordes sayeng that the romains were iniust grounded in auarice without suffisance or measure.
And co~men ennemies to euery man and to euery contrey: and that they had asmoch quarell agaynst Bocchus as agaynst hym.
And one selfe cause to warre agaynst them both: and also agaynst many other nacions whiche cause was but onely the pleasure of great lordshyp riches.
So that for the same cause all kyngdomes to the~ were aduers co~trary and that he hymselfe to them was enmy for the same cause.
And nat longe before that tyme the Carthagine~ses: and aftwarde Perses kyng of Ma+cedony were subdued vndone by the romayns without any iust tytle or cause of batyle: saue onely ambicion enuy whi+che the romayns had agaynst them.
And that in tyme to come euery nacyon whiche shulde haue welth and richesse shuld become ennemies to the romayns for their inordynat pride in saciable couetyse.
¶With these wordes and otherlyke Iugurth moued the mynde of Bocchus agaynst the romayns.
In somoche that anone a day was apoynted bytwene bothe the kynges to procede forth togyder to the towne of Cyrtha and to assayle the same with both their powers conioyned.
This towne they purposed first of all to besige: bycause Metellus had left with in the same towne his prayes and prisoners which he had taken of Iugurth.
And also moche of his owne ordynau~ce had he left there to a voyde impedyment in his voyage.
For if the myght wyn the towne by assaut before the rescous of Metellus: he thought that shuld be moost to his honour and profet.
Or els yf the romayne capitayne Metellus and his army shulde come to socours of the towne: than thought he that there both hymselfe and Bocchus shuld gyue batayle to Metellus.
Iugurth for craft and subtylte hasted hereto somoche the more to tangle Bocchus in the warre before any place shulde be moued bytwene hym the romayns.
And lest the same Bocchus by prolo~gyng of the tyme myght rather encline to peace than to warre after he at leasour shuld haue taken better cou~sell and aduisement.
For Iugurth suspected at begynnynge that Metellus in processe of tyme wolde desyre this Bocchus nat to medyll in this warre assistyng the part of Iugurth nor mentayning his cause.
¶Howe Metellus vsed hymselfe herynge that these two kynges were confederat agaynst hym and how after he was certifyed that the prouynce of Numidy was assigned to Marius the new consull: he cssed the warre for the nones.
WHanne Metellus knewe that the two kynges were associate togyder: he thought nat to fyght with them rasshely without prouisyon: nor in euery place for his aduantage or nat as he was wont to do often tymes before after the first tyme that he had ouercome Iugurth.
But within his feldes well and surely defended he kept hymselfe abydinge the com+mynge of the two kynges: and that nat farre from the towne of Cirtha.
This dyd he thynking it best to know the myght maners and co~dicions of the mauriens first or he wold fight with them bycause they were but newe ennemies and therfo+re their maners vnknowen to hym.
And whan he sawe his best auantage than thought he to gyue them batayle.
¶In the meane tyme whyle Metellus taryed the commyng of the two kynges: letters were brought vnto hym from Rome: which certifyed hym that the prouince of Numidy was co~mytted and gyuen to Marius the newe consull.
For he had herde longe before this tyme that the sayd Marius was elect co~sull: but this was the first tyme that he vnderstode the prouince of Numidy co~mitted to hym.
For this cause was Metellus moued displeased moch more than longed to measure or honesty.
In somoch that he coud neyther refrayne his eyen from wepyng nor measure his tong from spekyng yll by Ma+rius.
This Metellus was a synguler noble and worthy man in all other condicions: but the displeasure of his mynde he toke ouer womanly tenderly to his hert and namely in this cause.
Which condicion: some reputed to procede of a proude hert of Metellus.
And other some thought it no meruayle though his noble hert were moued and kyndled with anger for this iniury and wrong done to hym.
And many sayd that Metellus toke so great sorowe and displeasure: bycause the victorie which he had almoost optayned shulde be pulled out of his handes his selfe hauyng the labour and paryll and an other man the tryumphe and honour.
But to be playne in the mater and indifferently to write: it was nat vnknowen to the wysest romayns but that the dignite auauncement an honour of Marius greued Metellus: moch more than dyd his owne iniury.
And that he wolde nat haue taken it so heuely if the prouince of Numidy which was taken from hym had ben gyuen to any other noble men tha~ to Marius.
Wherfore Me+tellus was let from his first besynesse for the sayd displeasure so that he purposed nat to vexe hymselfe from thensforth with out thanke or profet.
And also he thought it foly to take in hande the charge of another mannes mater to his owne paryll labour and payne.
Wherfore he send messangers to the kyng Bocchus desyring hym nat to become ennemy to the ro+mayns without occasion.
And sayeng that he was as yet in su+che case that he myght adioyne with the romayns felowshyp loue and amyte: which shulde be moche better to hym more profitable than batayle.
And howbeit he trusted gretly in his power richesse and treasour: yet ought he nat to change certayne thynges for thynges incertayne.
For euery batayle to begyn is easy and lyght: but it is harde thynge to ende the same whan it is ones begon.
The begynning and endynge therof: is nat alway in the power of one same man.
For warre may be begon of a coward or of any other wretch: but it can nat be left of agayne nor ceassed but whan it pleaseth hym which is strongest and is maister hauynge the vpper hande.
And finally he had hym better to prouide for hymselfe and for his kyngdome than he began to do: and nat to adioyne nor myngle his goodes treasour fortune: which were in estate royall florisshyng with the goodes and fortune of Iugurth: which were lost and distroyed to the vttermost.
The embassadours of Metellus came to kyng Bocchus shewed hym their capitayns wyll: as is sayd before vnder suche sentence.
To the whiche wordes of Metellus Bocchus answered agayne benignely and mekely ynough sayng that he desyred nothyng more than peace: saue that he had pyte compassion of the aduers miserable fortune of Iugurth but if the same Iugurth myght be suffred also to haue frendshyp and amyte with the romayns forgyuenesse: than sayd Bocchus that he wolde gladly agre to euery thynge desyred of Metellus and euery thyng shuld be accorded bytwene them.
The capitayne Metellus heryng this answere of Bocchus: agayne sent messangers to hym replyeng agaynst his requestes and sayenge that some of his peticions were agaynst iustice reason: also Metellus by these embassadours desyred many other thyng{is} of Bocchus of whome Bocchus graunted alowed some: and other some of them he denyed.
After this maner the tyme ouerpassed and proceded forth massangers often goyng and co~mynge bytwene them bothe: so that by suche maner the warre and batayle remayned vntouched and depended nat medled with: as Metellus dyd greatly coueyt and desyre in mynde bycause he wolde kepe sure that lau+de which he had wonne: and also for that to his owne paryll dammage he wolde nat auantage nor auance Marius: in thynge whiche to hym belonged.
¶But here wyll leaue to speke of Metellus and retourne to speke of Marius whiche contrary to the wyll of all the noble men of Rome was creat consull by fauour of the co~mens: lykewyse as haue writen before.
¶Of the great ordynau~ce and preparacyon whi+che Marius the newe co~sull made agaynst Iugurth and for the warre of Numidy.
BVt Marius (as haue sayde before) was elect consull at great desyre and instau~ce of the co~men people: whiche also co~mytted to hym the prouince of Numidy.
Marius seyng hymselfe thus auanced: where he was euer agaynst the noble men of Rome before nowe was he specially fiers of mynde and stately.
And besy to displease and hurt the states: some tyme one by one and other whyle altogyder.
He often ty+mes boosted sayd that he had goten the consulshyp of them maugre their wyll as if it were a pray or spoyling{is} goten of his ennemies: and of men ouercome.
Many other boostynge wordes spake he to his owne commendacion and to great displeasure and anger vnto the estates of Rome.
But in the meane tyme he forgat nat to prepare euery thyng necessary to the warre: wherof the charge rested on hym to execute the same agaynst Iugurth from thensforth.
He demau~ded of the senatours co~mens newe supplement of soudyours to repare and restore the army which was in Numidy with Metellus.
For many of them were slayne and many deed of sickenesse: thus was the army sore deminisshed.
He called also for socors of suche nacions as marched to thempire.
And of kyng{is} whiche were co~federate and had conioyned felowshyp with the romayns.
Moreouer he raysed vp in Italy and nere about Rome as many as were strongest bolde mennes bodyes.
And namely such as he hymselfe had proued before in warre: and suche as in warfare were proued by dedes: and nat suche as were boosted by fame.
And namely olde soudyours which had longe haunted the warre and were pardoned therof.
So that it was in the power of no man to co~strayn them to warre without their owne fre assent: bycause that they had co~tinued styll in warre the season to them assigned of their captayns.
These treated Marius with so fayre flateryng and paynted wordes that they were redy to go with hym in warfare.
And how beit that the senatours were contrary to hym: yet durst they nothyng deny vnto hym belongyng to his besynesse: but gladly and with good wyll they decreed that he shulde rayse and chuse soudyours to fulfyll the nombre of them which wer lost in batayle in the contrey of Numidy.
But this dyd they for no gret loue which they had to Marius: for they thought that he shuld lese outher the execucion of the batayle which he intended with Iugurth: or els the fauour of the people which wold refuse to go forth to warre.
So that if Marius co~stray+ned them: their olde loue myght tourne into newe malyce and hatered agaynst hym.
But this thyng was trusted but in vayne of the senatours: for the moost part of the co~mens had an inestimable desyre to go to batayle with Marius.
For euery man cast in his mynde to be inriched by prayes spoylynges of warre.
And that more is: to retourne home agayne victours with moche honour and triumphe.
These thynges and otherlyke: they consydred whiche caused them gladly to folowe Marius and also Marius dyd nat a lytell enbolde confort their myndes with his exhortacion.
For whan euery thyng which he desyred of the senatours was confermed and decreed by them.
And whan Marius shuld assemble his soudyours: he thought to put them in confort by exhortacion and also to trouble displease the states of Rome as he was wont to do: and to chafe their myndes.
Wherfore he assembled and called togyder a great company of the commen people and spake to them by exhortacion and confortynge of them as herafter ensueth.
¶The orison or exhortacion of the consull Marius: had to the co~men people of Rome before his voyage into Numidy whiche exhortacion is demonstratyue contaynynge the laude and prayse of Marius: and dysprayse and blames of the noble men of Rome.
RIght worthy cytezins knowe well that many of these estates of auncie~t name haue nat themselfe behaued after one maner of co~dicion in desyring of you honorable dignities and great offices: and in administracion and gouernynge of them after they haue optayned the same of you.
For whyle they make their peticions: at begynnyng they be dyligent seruiable meke and curtayse of behauoure.
But whan they haue optayned their desyre: than passe they their tyme in slouth ydelnes and pride.
But it semeth to me in my mynde that they ought to do moche contrarely.
For of howe moch more valour the hole co~men wayle is: than is the co~sulshyp thoffice of the hy iudge or any other great office: with somoche more diligence charge shulde the hole co~men wele be gouerned than suche dignities or offices desyred of you.
Nor am nat ignorant but knowe right well how great the benefite is that ye haue gyuen to me: and howe great charge and besynesse therto belo~gyng is layed vpon me withall: whi+che besynes nedes must sustayne.
That is to say: to prepare and make redy an army withall other thynges necessary to batayle and to execute the same: neuertheles to spare the co~men treasour.
To compell to warfare and batayle: suche as a man wolde nat greue nor displease: that is you the co~mentie of Rome: whome wolde nat displease by any meanes.
To take charge and care for euery thyng within the cite and without.
And to do such thynges among enuious gentylmen obiectyng and layeng agaynst me in euery thynge whiche go about as men full of discorde and variance.
Verily noble citezins among suche men to take in hande suche charges it is more harde and thynge of more dyfficultie than any man can thynke or deuyse.
And moreouer: as for other co~suls whiche haue ben before my tyme whan they haue done any thynge amysse: than their olde noblenesse the strong and valyant actes of their predecessors the riches power of their frendes and kynsmen: and their many clyentes and seruant{is} of them retayned: all these haue supported and mentayned them in their mysdedes.
But all my richesse and helpe and trust of confort which haue is in my selfe nat in my kynsmen or other fauourers: which ayde of my selfe must of necessite defende with my vertue strenght and innocence.
For all other thynges which these auncient noble men haue to defende them be vnsure to me for haue them nat. Farthermore noble citezins this vnderstande that all ye haue good trust and confidence in me: and that all such as be equall iust and good: haue fauour vnto me.
For knowell that my good dedes hath profited the commen wayle.
And neuerthelesse these noble men seke occasions agaynst me inuadyng and assaylyng me with their malice and enuy.
Wherfore it standeth me in hande of necessite to labour somoche the more besely and quickely: that neyther ye be disceyued in this great trust whiche ye haue in me: and also that all the purposes of myne ylwyllers aduersaries may be frustrate and nothyng auayle agaynst me.
Forsoth haue euer from my chyldhode vnto this age ben of suche behauour that haue ben acustomed exercysed in all maner labours and paryls: whiche suffred and toke paciently for the co~men wele without any rewarde before this your benefite and honour whiche ye haue nowe gyuen to me.
Wherfore worthy citezins seyng yt ye haue now rewarded me better than am worthy: haue nat purposed to desyst nor leaue of myne olde good wyll anenst ye co~men wele: nor now rewarded of you purpose nat to omyt my good dedes which dyd frely before vnrewarded.
But touchyng these auncie~t gentylmen: it is very hard for the~ to temper themselfe beyng in power or dignite which onely dyd but fayne themselfe good and honest before they optayned promo+cyon to thintent to come therby to honoure and dignite.
But where as haue passed all my lyfe in right good occupacio~s by co~tinuall custome it is roted in me to do well: this custome is tourned with me into nature.
Treuth it is: that ye haue co~maunded me to warre agaynst Iugurth: whiche thynge these noble men taketh very greuously.
require you consyder and dyscus in your myndes and in your inwarde consideracion ponder ye: whyther it be better more necessary and expedient to change the same your commaundeme~t agayne: and to sende forth some other of that sort of auncient gentilmen vnto this besynesse agaynst Iugurth or els to any other lyke.
Send forth a noble man of olde auncetry: in honoure and remembrance of whome many ymages may be made erect or set vp on hy.
But of polycie of chyualry or warfare is he vtterly ignorant and inexpert.
Wyll ye change your pur+pose and sende forth suche one to warfare at pleasure of these gentylmen as who sayeth: that is best to be done for this cause.
To thintent that in so great a mater and wighty besynesse: suche a captayne more ignorant and ferefull than any of all his soudyours shalbe chosen of you whiche anone after shal chuse forth agayne some one of the commen people to be his maister: to informe and teche hym in suche besynesse as to his office and charge belongeth: hymselfe beyng ignorant of euery thyng necessary to be done.
By this meane it often fortuneth: that he whome ye ordayne to be captayne and co~maunder of your army: dothe chose an other to be captayne and commaunder ouer hymselfe.
In somoche that (if ye indifferently iudge) he: whome ye chose for capitayne is moch more mete to be made a symple soudyours than a capitaynr ouer other.
And also worthy citezins: knowe some of these noble men so farre out of order that whan they haue ben made consuls: than haue they gyuen themselfe to redyng of the actes of their elders and predecessours.
And of the grekes preceptes of chyualry: which doutlesse may well be called men without order for this co~syderacion.
For they shuld by due order first lerne to rule their office before they shulde take vpon them the charge therof.
First they take charge of office and than after lerne to rule it by way i~ordinate: how+beit euery wyseman wyll first lerne to gouerne an office befo+re he desyre it or take vpon hym the rule therof.
Thus worthy citezins co~pare me a newe gentylman with their immoderate pride and take diligent considercion whiche is best: to be nat gentyll of byrth and lowly and gentyll of maners: or els to be gentyll of blode and proude and vngentyll of maners.
Of suche thynges as they be wont to here to rede: some haue sene and some my selfe haue done.
haue lerned that by excercyse of chyualrie which they haue lerned by redyng.
Nowe iudge co~syder ye: whyther is better of dedes or warkes: of redynge and doyng.
They dispyce my neweltie of honour vnnoble lynage: and dispyce the vncraftynesse slouth of them.
My happy fortune is obiected of them agaynst me as to rebuke: but shame and dishonest behauour may be obiected layed agaynst them in rebuke.
Is it nat trueth that euery man is come of one lyke nature.
co~syder knowe well that one man is nat better nor more noble than an other: but if it be by his wysdome good maners vertu and strength.
And co~syder well that euery man the more that he is endued with vertue: the more excelle~t noble is he.
Thus is the strongest wysest and moost vertuous moost excellent in noblenesse.
¶But yf the fathers of Albinus and of Calphurnius: consuls and captayns in Numidy to the great dishonoure and damage of this empire were nowe lyueng that it myght be inquyred of them whether they had leuer that had bene begotten of them: or els the sayd Albinus and Calphurnius? What thynke ye they wolde answere? Forsoth nought els (as suppose) but that they wolde desyre and couet good chyldren and honorable lynage to procede of their stocke and generacion.
Thus syth it is so: that these estates dispyseth me: reasonably and of ryght lette them also dispyce their owne predecessours and forefathers of whose stocke and lynage they proceded: which came to noblenes and honour: nat by their auncetry: but by their owne strength wysdome and vertue: lykewyse as haue done.
Than lette them also haue enuy at my labours taken for defence of the co~men wayle: let them enuy myne innoce~ce and great peryls which haue ouerco~e.
For by these meanes haue obtayned also shall mentayne this honour which they so greatly enuy.
But these men corrupt by pride: after ye haue promoted them to worshyp: so pas forth their ty+me as yf they sette nought by your offices and honours by you optayned: but vtterly dispised them.
Thus they desyre such dignities of duety: as if they were worthy and deserued to haue them by their honest lyueng and vertuous conuersacion.
But certaynly they be greatly disceyued whiche loketh after two thynges co~trary bothe togyder at one season.
For they wold haue the voluptuous pleasure of slouth ydelnesse and the rewardes due vnto vertue and laborious dilygence.
But whan these gentylmen vtter their wordes before you or speke before the senatours: than in the moost part of their speche they exalt and commende their auncetry wenyng to be cou~ted more noble and excellent by re+countyng and reducynge to remembrance the valiant dedes of their progenitours.
For how moche more excellent the fame honour of their progenitour was: somoch more shamefull and reprouable is this cowarde ydelnesse of these gentylmen nowe lyueyng which so farre go out of kynde from the honorable conuersacion of their progenytours: as if they had neuer dyscended of them.
And verely this is certayne: the glorious dedes and honorable of forefathers be lyke an example or luminary vnto their ofspringe or progeny.
So that the same lyght suffreth neyther the good de+des nor bad of their progeny to be hyd.
For yf the progeny va+rie from the glorious actes of their progenitours than the honour of both is distayned: but if they folowe them in vertue than the lyght and glorie of the progenitours shynneth more radiantly by vertue of their progeny.
Of this laude and honour of my progeny can nat boost me for they were but of base degre.
Their dedes can nat auau~ce me nor make me noble.
But it is lawfull to me to speke of myne owne dedes whiche laude is moche more clere and excellent than to boost of other mennes actes.
But nowe co~syder ye how vnryghtwyse these gentylmen be to me: they wyll nat graunt me that laude and honoure by myne owne vertue and actes: whiche they vsurpe and proudely take vpon them: by vertue and dedes of other men.
And wherfore thynke ye do they this? Planely suppose bycause haue no ymages of my progenitours exalted in remembrance of them as these gentylmen haue: and bycause my noblenesse it but newe and springyng.
But certenly counte it more better and honorable to be rote and begynner of noblenesse vnto all my progeny and to leue the same vnto my branches: than to corrupt and defele noblenesse receyued of my progeny: as many of these gentylmen do.
Forsoth am nat ignorant but that yf these estates were nowe present shulde answere to my wordes their speche shuld be abunda~tly paynted ornate and elegant ynough.
But syth they cease nat to blame and reuyle with their lewde wordes in euery place both you and me for this your great office which ye haue gyuen vnto me: it hath nat pleased me to be styll nor to kepe secrete their fautes: lest some myght count culpable and worthy their rebukes: by reason of myne indyscrete pacience and sylence.
Neuerthelesse sothely their wordes can nat greue nor hurt me: after the conscyence of myne owne mynde.
For if they say trueth they can nought say but good and worshyp by me: but if they wyll nedes ly on me my maners my lyuyng and co~uersacion is suche that shall ouercome their wordes proue their iniust accusementes fayned and false.
But syth your counsell is blamed of these noble men bycause ye haue co~mytted to me this great honoure gretter besynesse: co~syder ye in your myndes diligently often whyther ye shall nede to repent you of this dede or nat.
To say trueth can nat boost my selfe of the ymag{is} of my {pro}genitors nor can nat recou~t vnto you the triumphes or co~sulshyps of myne auncetry.
But if the mater requyred: coude well shewe vnto you speres standerdes horse trappers harnesse: with many other rewardes of chyualry: some gyuen to me of themperour and some of other captayns for myne actes in batayle.
And other some which with myne hand{is} haue won of thennemies of the empire.
coude also if it neded shewe you the fore part of my body manyfolde scarres of many large wondes whiche haue taken in good worth for defence of our countrey and co~men wele.
This is my noblenes: nat lefte to me by heritage (as theirs is to them) but noblenes which haue won goten with great sore labours of my body paryll of my lyfe.
¶My wordes be nat ordred in ornate langage nor my spech ypaynted with rethorike lyke theirs for set lytell therby.
My vertue sheweth it selfe playnelie ynough without glosed or paynted wordes.
But these noble men must of necessite haue craft for to couer their shamefull and vngoodly dedes with this eloquent wordes their crafty rethorike speche.
Nor as for me: neuer lerned the greke letters nor langage whiche thyng these estates obiect agaynst me: as a great faut.
But to be playne: my pleasure was neuer moche to lerne such thynges which haue lytell auayled vnto the techers or lerners of the same neyther to acquisicion of vertue nor expulsion of vice.
But haue lerned am taught in other thyng{is} moch better more profitable to the co~men wele: as to assayle stryke myne ennemies: to dispoyle their ordyna~ce vitayls: to chafe their garnyson.
Nothing to drede nor feare saue an yll name: to endure take in good worth the pleasure of the somer the hardenes of the wynter both in lyke: to ly vpon the grounde: to endure hunger labour bothe togyder.
Therfore shall exhort informe my soudyours with these preceptes: whiche my selfe haue lerned vsed assayed.
Nor shall nat handell or treat theym by craft to thintent that they may auaunce me with richesse: nor vse them sharpely and my selfe plesa~tly: but i~ euery· difficultie shalbe their example of labour: nor shall nat put the labour to them and take the worshyp to me.
Thus ought a captayne demeane hym among his soudyours and namely among worthy citezins.
For whan a man lyueth delicately hymselfe and driueth his soudiours to the peryl of batayle by punyssheme~t or other rygour: he is nat to be called a captayne or ruler of an army: but rather a proude lorde or tyrannous oppresser of citezins.
Our elders worthely behauynge themselfe after this maner haue made noble excelle~t and inriched this co~men wele: and themselfe also.
But these estates which nowe lyueth trustyng to be honoured by the worthynesse of their {pro}genitours they the~seffe vnlyke of co~dicions despice vs haue vs in disdayne whiche folowe the maners of their {pro}genitors.
And euery hye office and all honours they chalange demaunde of you nat by their merites: but as it were of duetie and heritage.
But the ouer proude men erre moche from the trueth.
For though their {pro}genitors auncetry haue left vnto them euery thynge which to them was possible to leaue: as riches patrimony their ymages: for remembra~ce and example of them of their worthy dedes.
Neuerthelesse their vertue haue they nat left vnto them: nor they coude nat kepe it: for that onely can neyther be gyuen vnto them in rewarde nor receyued of any man.
These gentilmen say that am a man without ma+ners vnclenly of behauour.
And why? Forsoth bycause that prepare dresse nat curyously many delicyous bankettes so su{per}fluous deyntyous as they do: and bycause haue no iougler nor dysar wt me to moue sportes dissolut laughing: nor no more curyouse coke than one of the vyllage longyng to rural people which thyng{is} to haue as these gentylmen haue: it pleaseth me nat to knowledge.
For haue herde of my father and of other incorrupt and well disposed men: that suche delyciousnesse and curyosite belongeth vnto women.
Euery good man: thynketh it more co~uenient to haue plentie of worshyp than of richesse.
And more honoure it is to a good man to haue the walles of his hous garnysshed ouercouered with armour wherewith he may defend his cou~trey his frendes and hymselfe than with riche orname~tes of curyous warke of no profet saue onely the syght vayne regarde therof.
But syth these gentylmen thus obiect suche maters to me: let them co~tinue alway in such vices which lyketh the~ and that they haue euer reputed so dere.
Let them incline to voluptuosite: as daunsyng synging bankettyng playng to lechery to glotony dronkenes.
For in suche vices haue they spende their youth: in the same let them pas forth their age: vtterly subdued to the bely to slepe to ydelnes and subiect to the lustes of the vylest part of the body.
Let them leaue the swete of fyghting the peryll of deth the blyndyng of dust in batayle: and otherlyke paryls vnto vs to whome these be more acceptable than their feestes and voluptuous bankettes or other vyle pleasurs.
But they do nat so they be nat so contented.
For after that such vngoodly and vyle men haue dishonested themselfe by their foule dedes: than be they redy to take a way the rewardes of good men vnto themselfe.
Thus (agaynst all right) lechery and slouth moost cursed vyces dothe no hurt to such as occupyeth them: but they be vtter distruction to the co~men wayle and co~mens which be innocent and vnculpable.
¶But syth haue made answere to these dysordred gentylmen: and that moderately after my custome and co~dicion and nat so largely as their cursednesse vices ar worthy.
shall speke nowe a fewe thynges touchyng the commen wele.
And first of al haue ye good trust asperance touchynge the besynes of Numidy.
For ye haue nowe moued auoyded euery thyng wherby Iugurth was defended from begynnynge of the warre vnto this tyme: that is to say the couetyse of Calphurnius of Albinus: the vncraftynes and foly of Aulus: and the pride of Metellus.
By these founde Iugurth socour hytherto: but all these be auoyded nowe.
Moreouer ye haue there an army which knoweth the contrey but verily it is mo+re noble manly than fortunate or happy.
For a great part therof is wasted spent (and that wors is) infected and corrupted: what by the auarice and by the vnboldnesse cowardyse of their captayns.
Wherfore ye which be of lusty age and mete to endure the hardnesse of warre batayle: nowe labour ye with me and take ye in hande the defence of the commen wayle.
Nor let none of you be afrayed nor abasshed for misfor+tune of the other soudyours which haue foughten there before this tyme nor of the pride of their captayns.
For myselfe as cou~sellour of your besynesse felowe of your peryls shall be present with you in euery besynesse bothe in your iournays in your batayls also.
So that shall gouerne you my selfe without difference and vnder one forme in euery poynt.
And verely by helpe of the goddes we shall within short season obtayne all aua~tages co~modities which any man may wyn in batayle as prayes victory with immortall laude worshyp.
And certaynlie if these pleasors auantages were in dout or harde to obtayne (as they be nat): Neuerthelesse it were co~ue+nient to euery good man (as ye be) to socour defende the co~men wayle of their cou~trey fro distruccion dyshonour.
For certaynlie there was neuer man whiche obtayned immortal laude nor euerlastynge name by cowardise or
Nor there was neuer wyse father which wold wysshe his chyldren or sonnes to lyue euer: but onely that they myght lyue so long as they behaued themselfe worthely in goodnesse honesty: and so to passe forth their lyfe as natural course requireth.
¶Worthy romayns: wolde speke more vnto you if vnderstode that strength coude be encreased to feble or fearfull men: by wordes: but it is nat so.
Wherfore me semeth that haue sayed ynough and abundantly to noble and bolde harted men: as my trust is to proue you.
¶Howe Marius after his exhortacion endyd: anone laded shyppes with ordynance of warre and sende forwarde with the same one Ma~lyus his imbassadour: and howe he himselfe anone af+ter folowed withal his company.
And howe he behaued hymselfe in Numidy at fyrste begynnynge.
WHan Marius had vttred and ended his word{is} vnder this forme: and whan he sawe al the myndes of the co~mens enclined to the war in trust of victorie prayes.
Than anone without more delay he caused shyppes to be charged wt viteyls treasour for the soudyors wages with armour wepyn and all other thynges necessary to war.
And co~maunded one named Aulus Manlius which was assigned embassadours to hym: to departe forwarde with the same shyppes so charged.
In the meane season Marius hymself remayned at Rome a lytel tyme: and chose forth soudyours suche as hym thought most expedient: and nat after the custome of the olde romayns his predecessours nor after institucion of the auncie~t captayns which had ordred cartayne maner of peple of whome soudyours shuld be chosen for warfare in tyme co~uenient.
But co~trary wyse Marius admytted euery man indiffere~tly which was any thynge lyckely and had pleasure to go with hym.
And many suche he admytted also whiche were poore and nat suffred to go warfare before: lest their pouertie myght haue constraned them rather to fal to robbery than to dedes of chiualry.
How beit it was inacted of the olde romayns that suche excused of warre for cause aboue sayd: shulde pay a certayne somme of money pretaxed towarde the wages of such as laufully were admytted to warre.
Marius suffred none of these to pay any thynge at al: but elect many of them for his soudyours.
Many of the romayns surmysed that Marius elected vnto warre these abiect parsons: for want of other good soudyours.
Some other demed that he so dyd for fauoure ambicion and parcialite: bycause this sort of people assisted and honoured hym by auauncement at begynnynge of his promocion.
And also men consydred that vnto a man desyrous of dignitie and power: the moost nedy men be moost mete and behouable.
For suche nedy wretches be moost auenturous: for they haue nought to lose and alway trust in auauncement by auenturynge themselfe.
And therfore they iudge euery thynge which they do: good honest and laudable: if any auantage be therto appendant.
Thus dout they no paryll so that they may come therby to promocion.
At last Marius departed from Rome with somwhat gretter nombre than was graunted and decreed to hym of the senatours.
Within fewe dayes after that: he toke shyppyng and arryued in the prouince next vnto Affrike vnder the romayns at a towne named Vtica.
The army whiche was there with Metellus was delyuered to hym by one Publius Rutilius which was embassadour with the sayd Metellus.
For Metellus hymselfe fled the syght of Marius bycause he wolde nat se that with his eyen which he coude nat endure to here.
But whan Marius had restored and fulfylled the legions of his soudyors and the cohortes for the subsidyes and rescous.
Than went he into a plentyfull place of Numidy which was full of prayes.
All that he toke there: he gaue frely inrewarde to his soudyours.
This done: he assayled suche castels and townes which were but febly defended with men and walles.
He had many batayls lyght skyrmisshes: and many other thynges he dyd in other places nat with moche difficultie.
In the meane tyme the newe soudyours were redy manly fyghtyng without fere: and seyng that they which fled were other taken or slayne: therfore they aduysed them wel that the strongest and boldest was most sure of all.
They consydred wel that it stode them in hande to defende with wepyn and armour their libertie their countrey their frendes and all other thynges longyng to their and honour.
Thus laboured they for glorie laude and riches whiche they optayned: so that within short season the olde soudyours and the newe encreased togyder cherisshynge and infourmynge one an other tyl their vertue and boldnesse was lyke.
But whan the two kynges Iugurth and Bocchus vnderstode of the commynge of Marius: they deuyded their hoostes and went in sonder into dyuers places where no man coude attayne to them for difficultie of the places.
For it pleased hym so to do trustyng that within short space the romayns wolde be spred abrode in spoylinge and than thought he to assayle them in euery place whan they were moost without fere at libertie at large and vnprouyded: as men ar wont to be specially whan their ennemies behaueth them as if they were affrayed.
¶Howe Metellus the olde consull retourned to Rome: and of the worthy and valyant behauour of Marius agaynst Iugurthe and of his great actes at his begynnyng.
IN the meane tyme Metellus returned to Rome: which contrary to his opinion was receyued with glad myndes of the romayns after that the enuy which Marius had moued against hym was asswaged and ouerpassed: he was lyke dere and beloued both to the co~mens and senatours.
¶But Marius on his part applyed and toke hede to his owne besynesse and his ennemies also: without slouth but with great wysdome.
He perceyued wel knewe what was good and yll for aua~tage on both sydes.
He caused the wayes and iournayes of the two kynges to be dayly serched espied.
He suffred nothyng to be vnprouided and vnredy on his syde: but of the other syde and party of his ennemies: he suffred nothyng to be sure or prouided: for alway he preuented their {pro}uisions and pursued them.
Often whyle Iugurth and the Getulyans spoyled the Numidyens whiche had yelded the~selfe to the romayns Marius was redy in their way valiantly assayled them: and ouer thrue many of them whyle they were dispersed abrode and fleyng away for feare.
And also nat ferre from the towne of Cirtha he made Iugurth hymselfe so trust in his flyght that for hast to ren away: he laft his armour behynde hym.
But whan Marius co~sydred that his acres were onely glorious and excellent without any auantage: and that he myght nat batayle with Iugurth for his vnstedfastnes and mouyng from place to place: he consydred in mynde and ordayned hym redy to besyege the cities of the countrey one after another.
And namely suche as outher of men or of place were necessary and behouable to his ennemies and contrary or hurtfull to hym.
This dyd he thynkynge: that if Iugurth without dystourbance suffred hym so to do he shuld other be spoyled and bereft of his cities ordynance socours refuge: or els he must abyde the fortune of batayle stryue for the maistry in playne feld.
Bocchus the kyng of the mauriens had often sende messangers before vnto Marius: sayeng that he wolde gladly come into fauour amyte frendshyp of the romayns: and byddyng Marius nat to dout hym as an ennemy nor to fear any thyng longing to an ennemy to be commytted of hym agaynst the romayns.
It is but lytel knowen for trueth whether Bocchus fayned this thing to the intent that his co~ming to batayle vnknowen, vnproued myght be to Marius more greuous: or els whether he was wont by vnstablenes of mynde to change peace somtyme for warre: somtyme war for peace.
But Marius the consul (as he had purposed before) drue hym vnto the castels and townes whiche were walled defended: and fiersly assayled them.
Anone he tourned many of them from his enne+mies to hym· some by strength violence some by feare: and other some by {pro}misyng gyueng of rewardes prodicion of their captayns.
But at first begynnyng he medled but with meane castels townes thynking that Iugurth shulde come to defende and socour his people townes: and so come into danger of the romayns.
But whan Marius herde that Iugurth was far thens and occupyed in other besynesses: than thought he nat to lose his tyme: but to auenture on gretter thyng{is} wherin was more harde besynesse and gretter labour honour.
Wherfore he entended to besiege the cite of Capsa whiche was a great cite stronge and riche.
¶How Marius wanne the great and rych cytie named Capsa: and how he vtterly distroyed the same and gaue all the rychesse therof to hauocke among his soudyours.
AMonge the most wydest and thickest wyldernesses of Numidy was this great and ryche cite named Capsa: whiche (as men say) was first bylded by that Hercules whiche was borne in the lande of Libya: and nat by Hercules the sonne of Iupyter and Alcumena.
Thinhabitours of this cite were ruled by Iugurth peasably easely put to no charges nor besynesse and therfore were they moost true and faythful to hym.
They were defended agaynst al ennemies: nat onely with walles armour and men: but also with moche stronger defence of the difficultie hardnesse of the place and contrey nere about them.
So that it was in maner impossible that any army coude co~e nere them for want of water and scarcite of vitels.
For except the feldes places nere to the cite all the other be voyde wast grounde desart without habitacion vneared barayne and drie without water.
All full of serpe~tes: which were somoch more violent and fiers for lacke of meat and sustenance as al other wylde beestes be wont to inrage for hunger.
And moreouer the myscheuous and perilous nature of serpentes is more kyndled to ragyng and vexed with thyrst than with any other thyng: which thyrst they coude nat quench there for want of water.
Wherfore neyther man nor beest myght surely passe by them.
Wha~ Marius cast al these difficulties in his mynde: his hert was persed with a merueylous desyre to wyn this cite both for that it was moch hurtfull to hym: and profitable to Iugurth and also bycause it was harde to do and moche honour myght be gotten in wynninge therof.
And moreouer bycause Metellus the other consull before hym had won the cite of Thala with great honour and glory: whiche of sytuacion was nat vnlyke to this cyte: nouther vnlyke in defence.
Saue that nat far from the walles of Thala were a fewe fontayns: but about this cite of Capsa was no water wel nor fontayne: saue one and that was within the walles of the citie alway full of water.
All other whiche dwelled without the walles as in the suburbes: occupyed but rayne water.
The inhabitantes of that contrey and of all the remenant of Affrike which were far from the see and rude people coude moch the better endure this scarsite of water and thirst: for this cause.
For the moost part of them were fed with mylke and venyson nat lokyng after salt sauces nor other suche thynges as be norisshynges or prouocatiues to glotony.
They toke meate and drinke onely to their hunger and to quenche their thirst: and nat without measure to prouoke themselfe to pleasure of the flesshe as many christenmen do nowe i~ our dayes: which make of their bely their god.
And eate nat to lyue: but they lyue to eate contrary to ma~nes lyfe and vtterly enclined to bestialite.
cursed glotony let vs christe~men lerne her of panyms to eschewe the: whiche wasted the body and goodes: damnest the soule: and art mother and norice of al vices.
But to retourne to my purpose: this Marius after that he had serched euery thynge by his espyes he proceded in his interprise and purpose (as men thought) holpen of the goddes.
For agaynst so many harde difficulties he coude nat haue made sure prouision by counsell of man nor by his owne priuate wyt: as he whiche had impediment and was letted nat onely by shapnesse of the contrey: but also by lacke scarcite of wheat and of all other corne.
For the numidiens inte~deth more to norisshe pasture for beastes than to labour or ere the grou~de for corne.
And also they had brought togyder all the seed and corne of the yere befor into strong holdes as their kyng Iugurth had co~maun+ded them and moreouer at that season the feldes on euery syde were dry and bare without corne: and no maruale.
For it was about the extremite or later ende of somer.
Nat withstandyng all these difficulties and sharpnesses Marius made {pro}uision ynough as the mater required.
First he commytted all the bestes which he had taken in pray in foretyme vnto the horsemen whiche of their owne wylfolowed hym to war: or were sende to hym for helpe by frendes of thempire.
Marius commau~ded them to take charge to driue forth these beast{is}.
Than sent he Aulus Manlius embassadour of the hoost to a towne named Laris and al the cohortes of his soudyours with hym which were fotemen and lyght harnysed for to kepe the treasour of the soudyours wages and vitayls: whiche he had lefte in the same towne.
Marius kept his cou~sel of this interprise so secrete that none of all his company hye nor lowe knewe of his purpose nor whan he intended.
But whan Manlius and his company shulde depart towarde Laris: Marius dissimuled with them sayeng that he wold stray abrode in Numi+dy in rouyng and afterwarde within fewe dayes: he and his company wolde come also to the same towne of Laris laded with prayes of his ennemies.
This done he de{per}ted towarde a flod named Tana: no creature liuely knowyng of his purpose.
And euery day he distribued in his iournayes amonge his boost .xlii. heed of oxen for vitayle which he co~maunded to be deuided by euyn porcion amonge them by hunders and halfe hunders togyder: deuidyng vitayls to euery company after their nombre.
And in the meane season he charged bottels and bowges to be made of the hydes of the same beastes and of other ledder in great no~bre.
Moreouer he eased their scarcyte wheate and other corne: by wyse prouision.
And without knowledge of all his company he made good prouisyon of euery thing which might be necessary vnto his army in tyme of nede.
At conclusion the syxt day after whan they were come to the sayd flod of Tana: thyder was brought a myghty multitude of bottels and bowges made of ledder.
There pytched they their tentes with easy labour and small defence.
Than refresshed they themselfe with meate and drinke: and eased themselfe a certayne space.
This done: Marius commaunded them that euery man shulde be redy to procede forwarde euyn with the sonne goyng downe and that euery man shulde onely lade hymselfe and his beastes with water in the sayd bowges and bottels leauynge al other cariage burthens and baggage: there behynde them in their tentes vnder the custody of other soudyours therto assigned.
After this whan he sawe his tyme: he departed forthe from his tentes with his company: and lauboured al the nyght longe in his iournay.
The day after folowyng he rested in a secrete couert place.
In the same wyse behaued he hymselfe the nyght next ensuynge: and in the thyrde nyght moche before the day lyght he entred into a fayre and large felde ful of smal hylles and downes no more but two myle space from Capsa.
And there he taryed withal his hoost in the moost priueest maner abidynge the day lyght.
But assone as the day began to appere: many numidyens yssued forth of the towne: some to dysporte themselfe: and some about their besynes nought fearyng nor suspectyng of their ennemies.
Whan Marius sawe that: anone withal haste he sent all his horsemen to the towne and with them as many fotemen in lyght harnesse as were moost swyft and spedy.
Whome he commaunded to ren withal hast and boldely and valiantly to assayle the towne: and to besyege the gates.
Than after he hymselfe folowed spedely: but with good hede and aduisement: nat sufferynge his soudyours in the assaut nor in the way thyderwarde to fal to robbyng nor prayes by spoyling of their ennemies.
Whan thinhabitantes of the towne knewe herof: their case was vnsure their feare great and horrible: for the sodayne chaunce of them was nothynge suspected before nor prouyded.
Many of the cetezins whiche were without the towne and were taken and in power captiuite of the romains their ennemies sent vnto them within the towne desyring them for saue garde of their lyues to yelde themselfe and the cite to Marius.
All the numidyens inhabytantes therof which were of ful age able to bere wepen were slayne: and the remanent as women chyldren and aged men were taken prisoners and solde for their raunsome.
This dede agaynst the lawe of armes was nat thus done by Marius: by couetyse nor any outher crueltie of hym: but bycause the towne place was {pro}fitable and necessare to Iugurth to the romayns harde to come to.
And the maner of the people proued mouable and vnlauful euer of nature before: and neyther refrained from their yll appetite by benefite or good dede: nor yet with awe or feare of punysshement.
¶Howe Marius by fortune more than by strength wanne the strongest castell of all Numidy wherin were the tresours of Iugurth.
AFter that Marius had brought to ende so great and harde an interprise without any losse or da~mage to hym or any of his peple.
Though he were reputed noble great and excellent before: than began he to be counted more famous excellent.
Euery noble dede: was reputed to be done by strength wysdome of Marius: and ascribed to his strength and polycie.
And that suche thynges as were done by good counsell and prouision and also suche as hapened by fortune or chance: and by neglygence of their ennemies.
The soudiours were so manerly treated without crueltie or fiersnesse of their captayne and also made riche and abundant in treasour and iewels: that they exalted and praysed his name to the heuen.
But in contrarywyse the numidyens feared hym more than any man lyuynge.
Shortly to speke: both the frendes of thempire and ennemies also thought verily that outher Marius had a godly mynde and was a god hymselfe: or els that he was priue with the goddes: and dyd all his dedes and besynesse by their aduyse counsell and prouision: which shewed hym before what shuld fortune after.
But whan this chaunce had fortuned so well at Capsa: anone Marius drue hym to other townes and toke as many as he besyeged.
In some townes the numidyens resysted hym to their power: but it coude nat auayle.
In many other townes the dwellers gaue them ouer and left them voyde and ran away feryng so to be treated delt withall as they of Capsa were: bycause their townes were lyke behouable to Iugurth· and hurtfull to Marius.
Whan Marius came to any such towne: destitute and voyde of dwellers he set fyre in them brent them grounde smothe.
The aged men women chyldren: toke them to wodes and caues to hyde themselfe.
The yong men lusty which were taken were slayne downe right.
Thus was euery place fylled with wepyng wayling brennyng and slaughter: one mengled with other.
Finally yt Marius had won into his handes many townes castels: and some without resystence or blode shedyng of his men he went in hande with an other maistry and difficultie nat so sharpe nor harde to come to as was Capsa but to be won or besyged it was nat les harde nor of les difficultie.
¶Nat farre from the flod of Mulucha (which water deuydeth the kyngdome of Iugurth: from the kyngdome of Bocchus) was a great rocke or mountayne of stone in myddes of a playne: open ynough to be sene hauyng thervpon bylded a meane castel of quantite: but of a meruaylous altitude onely one strayet passage and narowe left to co~e therto.
But on euery other syde the rocke of naturall growyng was downe right lyke a wall: as if it had ben made for ye nones with man+nes ha~des.
Marius purposed with all his might to take this castell: and namely bycause the tresours of Iugurth were wtin the same.
But this his purpose at last came to effect rather by chaunce of fortune than by prouision or counsell.
For this castell was garnisshed plentuously instored with men wepen vytels and withall orther ordynance requisite necessary to defence of such a forteres.
Moreouer win the same was a fountayne ple~tyful of clere water.
And besyde this the sytua+cion therof was such that without maruelous difficultie vn+mesurable labour none ennemies myght attayne or approche nere therto their ingynes of batayle to frusshe the walles or any other part therof.
Besyd al these defe~ces the double walles this castel were garnysshed wt towres bulwarkes all other defences ingynes which coude be ymagined by mannes mynde: and that rownde about in compasse aswell within as without.
The way therto: by which the inhabitantes garnison vsed to go and come was very strayet and narowe.
Insomoch that the romayns entryng by the same way with their ingynes of batayle were co~straned to cut their pauases on both sydes and to make them more narowe for strayetnesse of the passage.
And in suche maner they proceded forwarde vnder the same in great paryll and with moch difficultie: and at conclusion all in vayne.
For whan they were come nere to the walles and wolde haue set vp and adioyned the same pauases to the walles to haue vndermined vnder them: all their labour was frastrate.
For what with stones and what with fyre the defenders of the castel brake and brent them agayne downe to the grounde.
Thus cowde nat the soudyors whiche vndermined the walles contynue togyder at their worke and besynesse: for strayetnes and difficultie of the place and importune violence of them within the castell.
Nor other soudyours coude nat serue them whiche made and repared the pauases without great paryll daunger.
For continually as fast as they raysed the pauases to couer and defende them selfe: they were broken and brent bytwene their handes.
In the meane tyme no soudyour was so good strong nor bolde: but that he was outher wounded or beaten done to deth.
Than was feare encreased to other that were feble and faynt herted.
¶But after that many dayes great labours in this maner were ouerpassed and spent in vayne.
Marius was sore angred vexed in his hert reuoluyng many thyng{is} in mynde: but specially whyther he myght gyue ouer his purpose (seyng his labour frustrate) or els abyde the chaunce of fortune which at many tymes before he had founde fauorable and frendly to hym.
Whyle Marius chafed brennyng in desyre reuolued suche thynges in his mynde both day nyght: it hapened by chaunce of fortune that a certayne lumbard a symple soudyour one of the company whiche was last sende from Rome to Numidy to supply the army strayed abrode from his co~pany a lytel way which lumbarde as he wandred founde among the stones many smal snayles crepyng on the grounde: nat far from that syde of the castel which was ouer agaynst the syde which the romayns besyged and assayled.
Bycause this lumbard in his cou~trey was acustomed lyke other of his countrey men to eate such snayles prepared after their maner: therfore he gathered first one and than an other and after that many: ascendyng vp by lytel and lytel: somtyme crepyng somtyme clymmyng for no other intent or purpose saue to gather such snayles: and so far he {pro}ceded by lytel and lytel tyll at last he came almost to the top of the mountayne.
But whan he sawe all that syde of the castel desolate and no person steryng: anone he began~e to haue a pleasure desyre in his mynde for to worke some maistry as the propertie and co~dicion is of euery man couetyng to wyn a name laude and riches: and to be spoken of.
By chance of fortune in the sa+me place where the lumbard stode in this aduiseme~t among the stones grue a great and olde oke tre hauyng the myddes a lytel bowyng downe towarde the grou~de: and the remane~t crokyng vpwarde agayne with myghty armes and branches ascendyng to the hyest of the walles with the top erect lyfred vp as euery herbe tre of nature is wont to growe vpwarde at the top.
This lumbard well aduised the same aduentured to clyme vp warde takyng his holde somtyme by the branches and bowes of this oke: and somtime takyng holde leauyng by the stones which appered forth in the wall tyl at the last he attayned vnto the very top of the wall.
And whan he sawe no man styring on that part there stode he styl espyed of no man and noted co~sydred wel at his pleasure al the inwarde part of the castel and the playne within the walles about the towre.
This lumbard had somoche the more leasour to take so long aduisement vnespyed for al the numidyens defenders of the castel were on the other syde attendyng gyueng hede to the assaut and defendyng themselfe and the castel agaynst the romayns.
Whan the lumbard had espyed and consydred euery thyng which he thought myght be aua~tage to his after purpose: than he desce~ded agayne downewarde by the same way which he ascended: but nat without hede nor with so lytel aduisement as he ascended vpwarde: but prouyng euery way and lokyng about yf it were possible to brynge into the castel any co~pany of men by that syde or nat.
This wel consydred: assone he descended: anone he went to Marius and informed hym of euery thynge as he had done exhortyng requiryng hym to put in profe whether the castel myght be won on that syde where he had ben. Farthermore he {pro}mised hymselfe to be gyde vnto such as wold vndertake that intprise sayeng that in the mater was no danger.
Marius heryng these wordes of the lumbard sende forth with hym certayne of his men of them which were there present to vnderstand knowe the trueth of the mater.
Whan they had ben there retourned to Marius agayne: some brought hym worde that the mater was easy to do: and some other sayd that it was very harde perylous.
The sente~ce of euery man was after as their mynd gaue them.
The cowardes thought it harde but such as were of bolde hertes and desyrous of worshyp thought it easy and without moche peryl.
Neuerthelesse the mynde of Marius was somwat exalted to co~fort and good hope: and therfore of al the company of trumpettes and of other such mynstrels as be wont to be in batayle to gyue courage and signes to the he chose forth fyue which were moost swyft moost lyght and delyuer: and .iiii. hundred men he assigned to assyst and defende the sayd tru~pettes.
And al them he co~maunded to obey to the lumbard and to be ruled ordred by hym in euery thyng.
The day next folowyng was assigned to them to procede forth i~ their besynesse.
Whan the tyme assigned prefixed by Marius was come the lumbard wt his co~pany had made redy and ordred euery thyng: and so went to the place where be had ben before.
But whan they were come thyder: the lumbard their gyde caused them to change their armour and to make bare their heedes and their fete: to thintent that they so bare heded the better might se aboue them and on euery syde of them: and that they beyng bare fote myght labour somoche the better and take better hold in clymming vp by the stones.
Their swordes were fastned behynde at their backes their buckelers withal which were made after the fassion of the nu+midyens buckelers of lether: bycause of lyghter weyght and burthen.
And also to shintent that they shulde gyue lesse sounde or noyse if it hapned any stone to smyte agaynst them.
This done: the lumbard went vp before them and bounde smal cordes to the stones and to the olde rotes whiche apered aboue the stones where he coude espy any suche wherby the soudyours sustayning themselfe takyng holde might more lightly with more ease mount and clym vpwarde.
And somtyme he went before and helped them vp with his handes specially such as for that vncustomed way were somwhat fereful.
Somtyme whan thascendyng or goyng vp was ouer harde and sharpe: he put eche of them vp before hym without armour: and than he hymselfe folowed with their armour and wepyn.
Suche places where moost dout was in: he specially proued and assayd them moost of al: and in goyng comyng often tymes vp downe by the same moost dangerous passages: he encreased audacite boldnesse to the remena~t.
Thus after they had ben sore weryed and with long great labour endeuored themselfe: at last they came into the castel whiche on that syde they founde desolate without defence.
For (as sayd is before) al they which were with in the castel were occu+pyed in fightyng or redy to fight agaynst the romayns: as they were on other dayes before.
But whan Marius vnderstode by messa~gers how the lumbard had done: how beit that al the day before his men had ben sore besied and occupyed in fightyng: assayling the castel.
Neuertheles specially at this tyme he exhorted enbolded them: and he hymselfe departing forth from vnder his pauases caused his soudyors to adioyne themselfe nere togyder to holde vp their sheldes aboue their heedes so that the co~ioyning of them semed as it wer the frame of a volt.
Marius kept hym vnder the same for his defence so approched to the walles.
And both he his company whiche were nere about hym valiantly assayled the castel: and also other of his co~pany which stode a far of coude nat come nere the walles for prease: assayled the castel fiersly from a far and sore vexed and put in feare their ennemies within the castel throwyng agaynst them plumettes of leed with slynges arowes dartes and al other maner engyns of batayle wherwith any thynge coude strongely be throwen into the castel.
But the Numidyens within the castel had often before this tyme ouertourned and brent the tentes and pauases of the romayns and toke therby so great audacite and boldnesse that they defended nat themselfe within the castel walles: but walked vp and downe without the castel walles bothe day and nyght reuilyng and reprouynge the romayns and obiectyng cowardyse agaynst Marius.
And thretnyng that his soudyours shulde be made subiectes and bonde men to Iugurth in tyme to come whome they purposed at that tyme to make bonde to them.
Thus whyle they thought themselfe sure and their mater in good case: they were harde and egar ynough reuylinge and thretnynge the romayns.
In the meane space whyle the romains and their ennemies were besyest fighting withal their myght: the romayns for laude glorie and lordshyp: and the Numidiens for their helth and sauyng of their lyues.
Anone sodenly the lumbard with his company which were within the castel on the backsyde blewe their trumpettes.
First of al the women and chyldren which went to the walles to se the bykering were al abasshed and fled inwarde to the castel: and after them al the soudyors which were without and nerest to the walles and coude escape in.
And finally they all bothe armed and vnarmed fled inwarde.
Whan the romayns sawe this they assayled the castel more fiersly: some they slewe and ouerthrue: some they wounded ouerpassynge or standyng vpon the bodyes of them which were slayne.
Al their desyre was with their handes to wyn glorie and worshyp.
They stryued to ascende vnto the walles euery man couetyng to be before other.
None of them al taryed nor was let with spoyling{is} nor prayes.
Their great courage suffred them nat to loke there after tyl by manhode and strength they had won the castel.
Thus was fortune fauorable to Marius: so that his first negligence and vnwyse boldnesse to assayle a ca+stel inexpugnable was tourned by chance from rebuke to glo+rie and laude such was his fortune.
But whan Marius had won this castel after estimacion of man nat able to be won: than was he lorde of the moost part of al the treasour of Iugurth: the castel was gyuen al to murdre and hauocke.
And the soudyours of Marius richely rewarded euery man after his desert.
¶How in the meane tyme whyle this castel was in wynnynge a noble man of Rome named Lucius Sylla: came from Rome to Marius with a great bende of horsemen: and of the maners behauour of this Sylla.
IN mean tyme whyle this fiers assaute and victorie was concluded at this castel: a famous lorde of Rome named Lucius Sylla tresourer of the army came from Rome to Marius with a great bende of horsmen.
Whome the same Marius at his departyng from Rome had left there to rayse and assemble socours vnto the war among the Italiens and other nacions frendes and louers of thempire of Rome.
¶But forasmoch as the matter moueth vs to make mencion of so worthy a man and of his disposicion and maners: therfore it semeth me conuenient in this part somwhat to write of his behauour conuersacion: and that as brefely as may conueniently: namely for two causes.
The first for that intende nat to make relacion of his behauour maners in any other place of this cronycle saue here.
Secondly for asmoche as none other authour hath written sufficyently of hym.
For howe beit that one hystoriagraph named Lucius Sisenna: wrote most dyligently and best of his actes of any other before neuertheles me semeth that he spake lytel acordynge to trueth nor indyfferently.
For his tong nor pen were nat at lyberte for asmoch as he was so~what in danger to ye sayd Sylla: wherby he was prohibyted to say or to write acordyng to ye trueth.
For what by fauour what by fere he durst nat touche playnly the vices which were in hym.
But here purpose (all fauour and fere layd a part) indifferenly to write of him.
¶This Sylla of progeny: was descended of moost noble stocke of the remai~s.
Howbeit the name of his auncetry was almost lost and decayed by dulnesse negligence and slouth of some of his lynage.
In greke and in laten he was of lyke connyng: and excellently seen in both the langages.
Of voluptous pleasours he was desyrous: but moche more desyrous of glory laude.
In vacant leser he was moch enclined to ye lustes of his body.
But suche pleasure or voluptuousnes dyd neuer let nor withholde hym from any besynesse or ocupacion necessary: howbe+it such pleasure so blynded hym that he toke no wyse of byrth maners and honestie co~uenient for his estate.
He had the wayes easely to get frendshyp and it was also no maistry to get fre~d+shyp of hym: in fayning dissimulyng and counterfaytinge of besynesses: his wytte was very hye and excellent.
He was a marueylous incredyble gyuer of many thynges but specially of money: and before the warre and victory which the noble men of Rome: had agaynst the co~men people: He was so noble worthy reputed that it is in maner incredyble: nor his good fortune neuer passed the policy of his wyt: in somoche that many men were in dout whyther he was more fortunate than strong.
But after the victory of this warre: so vngoodly was his demeanour so cruel that verily knowe nat whyther may more be asshamed or greued to write it or to speke therof.
For after that this warre of Numidy was ended: both Marius this Sylla were retourned to Rome: a great discorde fel bytwene the lordes co~mens.
Marius toke part with the co~mons: but Sylla toke part with the lordes and at last droue Marius forthe of the citie.
After that: an other man of great power called Cynna whiche had ben fyue tymes co~sull of Rome gathered an hoost of men and toke part with Marius agaynst this Sylla.
But at co~clusion Sylla ouercame hym in batayle: and slewe hym.
After this: Sylla cruelly murdred an other noble man of Rome named Caius and with hym yonge Marius sone of this Marius which warred in Numidy.
Last of al whan this Sylla had won victory ouer Marius his fauourers: than became he most cruel of al other: in somoch that he fylled al the citie with blod of the citezins.
But here wyl leaue to speke farther of this Sylla or of his behauour i~ cruelte: and returne to write of his behauour in this warre of Numidy vnder Marius.
¶After that this Sylla (as haue sayd before) was come to Affrike to the hoost of Marius with his co~pany of horsemen: within short season he became most expert in chiualry crafty aboue al other: howbeit before this tyme he was but ru+de ignorant of dedes of chiualry.
And moreouer he treted gouerned his soudyours with maners mekenes.
And gaue rewardes to many: to some whiche desyred hym: and to some other of his owne pleasure non desyred therto.
But he wolde take no rewardes nor gyftes agayne without it were agaynst his wyl.
And if he so dyd at any tyme agaynst his wyl: than was he more redy to gyue agayne that which was gyuen to hym: than to pay that money which he had borowed of other.
He demaunded nothyng agayne of any man though it were due and det to hym: but rather he laboured and endeuored hymselfe that many myght be in his det and by suche meanes to haue them bounde to hym.
And how beit that he was one of the grettest of Rome: yet disdayned he nat the co~pany of the most symple soudyours of the hoost: but co~muned and acompanyed with them both in sportes in sadnes.
In batayle in watchyng{is} with other besynes of warre he suffred no man to be before hym.
Nor i~ the meane season he neyther hurt the good name of the co~sul nor of none other good man: which thing men desyrous of worshyp honour be often wont to do for in dispraysing of other they thinke to obtayne great laude to the~selfe.
He onely laboured that none might passe hym neyther in counsel nor in might or manhod of his hand{is}.
By whi+che maners condicions in short tyme he became very dere wel beloued nat onely to Marius: but also to al the hoost.
¶How Marius preuayled in batayle agaynst both the two kynges Iugurth and Bocchus.
BVt whan Iugurth had lost the towne of Capsa as is sayd before: and dyuerse other fortresses and other places defensyues which to hym were profitable.
And also a great quantite of his treasour wherin he moost trusted: Anone he sent messan+gers to kyng Bocchus requiryng hym in al hast to come to Numidy and to bryng his army with hym: sayng that it was hye tyme to make batayle with Marius.
But whan he vnderstode that Bocchus prolonged the tyme in ouerlong taryeng hauyng dyuers co~syderations of peace and warre as he that was in dout of the chaunce and fortune of the ende therof.
Iugurth agayne corrupted the next of his counsel with gyftes in lykewse as he had done before: and promysed vnto the kyng Bocchus hymselfe the thirde part of the kyngdome of Numidy: if the romayns were dryuen out of Affrike or yf the war shulde be brought to ende without losse or diminisshyng of his kyngdome and marches therof.
The kyng Bocchus induced with hope of this reward with a great multitude of people came to Iugurth and adioyned both their armies togyder in one.
¶At this tyme Marius with his co~pany was in his iournay towarde the {pro}uince which was in the coost of Affrike apartayned to thempire: where the sayd Marius purposed to rest with his co~pany tyl the wynter were past.
But whan he was in his iournay in leest dout: Iugurth and Bocchus bothe togyder inuaded and set vpon hym and his men whan the tenth part of the day scarsly remayned.
This dyd they: thynkinge that the nyght which was nere come shulde to them be great socour and defence if they were ouercome: and if they dyd ouercome the ro+mayns: it shulde be to them no damage nor impediment bycause they knewe the contrey place better than the romains.
But on the other syde bothe these chaunces: in darkenesse were harde and contrary to the romayns: for they knewe nat the coostes of that countrey.
Marius anone had vnderstandyng of the co~myng of his ennemies by many of his espyes: but it was ouerlate.
For assone as he had worde: his ennemies were euyn at hande.
In somoch that before the army coude be set in order or aray: and or they coude remoue or gather togyder their baggage which at that tyme was abrode: and before they coude take any co~maundement of their captayne by worde or sounde of trumpettes: The horsemen of the Maurians and of the Getulians ran togyder vpon them nat in order nor aray of batayle: but by companyes and bendes togyder as it fortuned them to come togyder in heapes and clusters.
The romayns for the moost part: were al amased and greuously abasshed for that sodayne and vnprouided feare.
Neuerthelesse they forgate nat their olde manhode stre~gth some drue them to their armour: and other some whiche were armed alredy defended their felowes tyl they armed the~selfe.
Other some mounted on horsebacke and boldly rode agaynst their ennemies: and encountred them valyantly.
The fyght on both parties was more lyke a skirmysshe among brigandes and rouers than to any apoynted or ordred batayle.
For the horsmen fotemen were mengled togyder without standerdes cognysances or any ordynaunce aray or order.
Some they wounded mortally: And many they bereft vtterly of their lyues and slewe them in that place.
The remenant which shar+pely and manly resysted they compased them about on euery syde: and aswel behynde as before assayled them: so that neyther manhode strength nor armour: was able sufficiently to defende them: And no maruel for their ennemies were mo in nombre than they: and compased them about on euery syde of them.
But finally the romayne soudyours which were bothe of olde and newe: and therfore bothe strong bolde and crafty in batayle: gathered them as nere togyder as they myght.
And where it fortuned any nombre of them to mete togyder: they tourned backe to backe ioyned them rounde one with an other in maner of a compase or cercle: and so they saued defended themselfe togyder that on the backehalfe no man coude assayle them: but yf he brake in through the myddes of them whiche was in maner impossible.
By this maner they sustayned the myght of their ennemies: and also saued themselfe.
Nor their captayne Marius in this ieopardous and sharpe besynes was nat affrayed at al nor of lesse corage and boldnesse than he was before: but styred about euery where in the batayle.
And his men of garde about hym whome he had chosen rather of the strongest and boldest men of the host than of such as were moost familier with hym.
For he set more by the audacite of them tha~ by the familiarite of the other: and namely in such a ieopardous case.
So~tyme he socoured his soudyours in their nede or such as he sawe in paryl.
And somtyme he ran in amonge his ennemies: where they were thyckest.
And nat withstandyng their resystence he assayled them valiantly: and wounded slewe and ouerthrue them on euery syde he dyed his weapen in the reed blode of the blacke Mauriens and Getuliens.
And bycause that in so harde a case: and in so great and troublous noyse rumour he coude nat counsel nor confort his soudyours with his tong therfore he thought to counsel incorage and confort them with his hande gyuyng them example surely to bestowe their strokes.
Many of his ennemies sende he to hel cryeng in vayne vpon their for helpe.
The dartes iauelyns pykes plumettes of leed stones with other suche instrumentes of batayle wer cast so thicke on both parties that the ayre therwith was indymed.
The strokes were so coursly charged on the bright helmes and harnesse that the fyre sprange out on euery syde: so that it semed to be the lyghtnyng: the cry of the men dyeng: the neyeng of the horses: and the dyn of the strokes with the sounde of the trumpettes: was horryble and tedyous to here.
Thus continued they tyl the day lyght was passed and the nyght come.
The numidyans getulians and maurians desysted nor ceassed nothing for that.
But as both Iugurth and Bocchus before had warned co~maunded them: they continued more sharpely than before thynking that the darkenesse of the nyght shulde be for their aua~tage.
Marius this vndersta~dyng toke counsel made best {pro}uision for hymselfe his men: whiche he myght in suche case: and as the mater required.
And to thintent that his people myght haue some place to resort vnto for refuge socours: he prouyded before and ocupyed two hylles nere togyder of whome the one was ouer na+rowe of lytel grou~de to receyue his hole army tentes: but in the top therof was a fayre fountayne of pure water moch necessary.
The other hyl was sufficie~tly large to receyue his hole hoost and tentes: and also very defensyue for it was of a great altitude and done right on euery syde.
Insomoche that they whiche shulde take that hyl were sure ynough without great defence of themselfe for nature had it sufficiently defended.
This wel considred: Marius commaunded Sylla his vndercapten to take with hym al the horsmen and to tary that nyght about the smaller hyl where the fountayne was.
This done: he hymselfe gathered togyder by lytel and lytel the remanent of his soudyours dispersed abrode: their ennemies being nat lesse troubled than were they.
Whan Marius had thus assembled agayne his men togyder he led them all with ful cours vp vnto the larger hyl.
Thus the two kynges Iugurth Bocchus seyng it in vayne to fyght with the~ whiche were on the hyer grou~de and also on so sure a place: were co~strayned to leaue the fyght: for difficultie of the place which the romayns had taken.
But neuertheles in the meane tyme they suffred nat their men to depart far thens: but compased bothe the hylles rou~d about with their hole multitude there taryed rested shed abrode vpon the ground.
Whan they had taken their place in this maner: they made great fiers here there in many places of their hoost: and the barbarians after their custome passed forth the most part of the night in myrth pleasure gladnes reioysing daunsyng: and making great noyse and dyn: rennyng and goyng from place to place: and loudly crieng synging and reuellyng.
The kynges themselfe were also nat a lytel proude and fearse: bycause they had nat fled from the batayle: and counted themselfe as ouercomers seyng that they helde the romayns so besieged which as they thought durst nat abyde them.
On the other part the romai~s inte~tyfly gaue aduerte~s to the demeanour of their ennemies.
And for that the romayns were on the hyght of the hyl and without lyght: therfore more easy from darknesse of hyer pla+ces they parceyued al the dedes and behauour of their ennemies which were beneth them: and moch more euidently by light of the fyers.
This vnwyse behauour of the numidiens put the romayns in great confort and was great courage to them.
And specially Marius was greatly confermed in hope seyng their negligence their folly and vncraftinesse: wherfore he co~maunded his folke to kepe sylence as styl as might be possible without any noyse.
In somoche that he suffred nat the tru~petes to sou~de the watche: as warryours ar wont agaynst night.
Afterwarde whan the day began to apere: the numidiens were al weryed wt their cryeng ouerlate watchyng and reuel: and had gyuen the~selfe to rest a lytel before as men without feare or dout of ye romayns.
But certenly it is a true {pro}uerbe which is often sayd: that after fayre wether succedeth te~pestious cloudes: and aft myrth ioye often cometh sadnes and sorowe.
For whyle they ingorged fylled with wynes lay slepyng on the grounde as beestes without fere without {pro}uision: Marius co~mau~ded sodenly all his trumpetes clarionistes with other mynstrels to sound their instrume~tes as shyrle as they coude altogyder and that al his soudyours shulde set vp a shout or cry as horribly as they myght: and with that inuade and breke into the tentes of the numidyens.
This was shortly done: wherfore the numidyens mauriens getuliens astonyed and abasshed with that vnknowen and horryble noyse: were sodenly awakened of sleape: and seyng them thus co~pased with their ennemies: what for feare of deth and of the noyse they were so amased that they had no power neyther to fle nor to drawe to them their armour nor vtterly to do or prouid any maner socour for themselfe.
Thus they stode astonyed for this horrible noyse and cry as yf madnesshe had entred them: none able to socour hymselfe nor other.
The romayns alway increased to them their noyse and feare assayling murdring and woundyng them without any resystence.
Finally al they were outher ouerthrowen slayne or wou~ded: or els fled their armor standerdes and weapen left behynde them: and mo were in this batayle slayne: than in al the batels before.
For amonge them al none was taken prisoner: for with fere and sleape so amased were they that fewe escaped by flight.
¶Of the great prouysion and wysdome of Marius after his victory: and of the seconde batayle which he had agaynst the two kynges in which also he had great vyctory with laude honour.
WHan Marius had gloriously thus ouer come the moost part of his ennemies except the two kyng{is}: he drue hym than towarde his wyntring places as he had purposed before.
And ordred hymselfe his men specially in hauen townes bycause of more easy {pro}uision of vytels: but neuertheles: in his iournay thyderwarde: for al his victory: he becam nat negligent vnware nor proude: as captayns often ar wont aft victory goten of their ennemies: but he {pro}uided and went forwarde with his army quadrat and deuided into four partes ordred apoynted as if his ennemies had ben in his sight Sylla was assigned to take charge of the ryght wyng of the army and al the spear men with hym.
And with hym the slyngars archers the cohortes of Lumbardes.
The peticapitayns with fotemen of lyght harnesse: were distributed and dyuided in the vantgarde and rerewarde.
Of the treatours whiche had forsaken Iugurth and came to the romayns: suche as were best laboured and knewe best the contrey were chosen forth and sent out to espy the contrey and wayes of Iugurth Bocchus.
But nat withstandyng Marius hymselfe was as prouident circu~spect and diligent withal: as if he had co~mytted the charge to none other.
He was mouyng co~tinually from place to place ouer all the army: laudyng co~mendyng and rewardyng the good soudyors: and blamyng and rebukyng the bad he hym selfe armed and diligently prouidyng and ministryng vnto them euery thyng necessary and expedient: and co~pelled them that were frowarde and ylwillyng to labour.
In euery place where he set his tentes in his iournay: he ordred defence with depe dyches and trenches rounde about his hoost.
And in the entres of the tentes he assigned soudyors elect therto to kepe watch and some to kepe scoutwatch about the tentes in compasse.
Moreouer some other he ordred on the castynge of the dyches and on outwarde bulwarkes to defende the remanent if any sodayne peryl apered.
He hymselfe armed nyghtly we~t about and serched the watch.
Nat specially for any feare nor mystrust of any paryl to come nor for feare that his soudyours wold nat obey his co~maundeme~t.
But specially to thentent that the loudyours seyng their captayne nat refusyng labour nor paryl: shuld be also more wylling to folowe the same and to take payne vpon themselfe as ashamed if they dyd nat asmoch as their captayn.
And certenly at this tyme at many other during this warre (as rede) Marius co~strayned his soudyors to labour rather for shame tha~ wt sharpnes or punissheme~t.
For shame it is to the seruant to be ydle wha~ the maister sore laboreth.
Howbeit some sayd that Marius toke this labour vpon hym for the desyre of co~mendacion worshyp: bycause that fro~ his youth he was euer wont with hardnesse hunger thirst and labour: and many other thynges whiche the delycate gentylmen of our tyme count for miseries.
But to Marius were these hardnesses moche pleasure and delyte for affection whiche he had agaynst the commen wayle as equal persones supposed.
But to what euer intent Marius: treated his army in this wyse: it was knowen that his dedes dyd asmoche profet and worshyp to the commen wayle of Ro+me: as if he had more rigorously and sharpely treated his soudyours.
For al thynges were ordred wel and worthely for the honour and profet of the commen wayle: as if he had more rigorously treated his army.
¶But to retourne to my purpose: whan Marius with suche dyligence as sayd is: was come nat far from the towne of Cirtha at the last the fourth day after the forsayd batayle: the espyes of their ennemies appered on euery syde.
The romai~s vnderstode anone therby that their ennemies were at hande.
The espyes of the romains also which were sende forth: brought the same tidynges from euery coost of the cou~trey.
Marius perceyued that his ennemies were in diuerse co~panyes and deuided: wherfore he was vncertayne howe he myght best order his hoost to receyue them: And therfore perceyuing it vnsure: how to order the forfront of his batayle as it ought: he abode his ennemies in the same place no order chaunged with his hoost deuyded in .iiii. partes (as sayd is) as he whiche was redy and prouyded for euery chau~ce.
For he had deuyded his hoost into four partes trustynge to inuade some of the romayns on the backehalfe with parte of his army: and with an other part to encou~ter with them and with the other two partes to enclose them on both the sydes: and so to enuyron them rounde about.
In the mean tyme Sylla which first encountred with Iugurth exhorted co~forted his men aswel as he might for breuite of the tyme.
That done: anone he proceded with his company by bendes clustres togyder their horses conioyned in the moost thyckest maner: and so fiersly assayled the Maurians.
The remanent of the fotemen whiche were vnder Sylla: remayned and kept themselfe styl in their first place: and defended their bodyes from the dartes whiche their ennemies thrue agaynst them from farre.
But if it chaunsed any of their ennemies to come bytwene their han+des: they hewed them downe to decrease the nombre.
¶Whyle Sylla and his horsmen thus fiersly were fightyng on the right wyng of the batayle: The kyng Bocchus assem+bled togyder the fotemen whome his son named Volux had brought thyder with hym.
These fotemen had suche impediment in their iournay thyderwarde that they came ouerlate to the other batayle whiche was last foughten before this.
Wherfore Bocchus: whan he had assembled inbolded with his word{is} these fresshe fotemen: with them he assayled fiersly the rerewarde of the romayns.
¶In the meane tyme Marius hymself was occupyed in the forwarde of his hoost and there employed his wysdome and strength as a valyant and worthy captayne: and so stode it hym in hande.
For in the forwarde Iugurth hymselfe with his grettest power stro~gest co~pany of men inbatayled with hym.
¶But after that Iugurth knewe of the co~myng of Bocchus to the felde: anone he turned hym with a smal co~pany about hym priuely vnto the fotemen of the romayns: and there with an hye voyse he cried vnto them sayng that they fought but in vayne.
For a lytel before he had slayne Marius with his owne handes.
And in cryeng these wordes he lyfted vp withal and shewed his swerde al ouersprincled and dyed with blode: whiche he had so couloured in the batayle fiersly ynough in murdring the fotemen of the romayns.
For he had lerned to speke latyn longe before in the batayle of Numaunce.
Whan the romayns herde these wordes they were affrayed but more for crueltie of the noyse: than for any confidence or trust whiche they had to the messanger.
But on ye other syde the myndes of the barbariens wer bolded exalted by these wordes: by reason wherof more sharpely they inuaded the romayns seynge them abasshed astonyed.
And nowe were the romains of the forwarde at that poynt that they were redy to gyue themselfe to flyght: as men dyscouraged for the sayd tidynges.
¶Whan they were at this poynt: it fortuned so at the same tyme that Sylla had beaten and ouerthrowen the mauriens which inuaded and assayled hym on the right wyng of the ba+tayle: wherfore he retourned to his co~pany fiersly assayled the fresshe fotemen which wer with Bocchus and at one syde brake in amonge the thyckest of them.
But Bocchus anone tourned his backe: and gaue hymselfe to flyght.
¶On the othersyde Iugurth which in his part of the batayle almost had optayned vyctory dyd his diligence to incoura+ge support his co~pany: and to mentayne that aua~tage whiche he had won.
For whyle he laboured there about as a worthy captayne: the spear men of the romayns so co~pased hym his co~pany about both on ye right syde on the lyft: that al his garde other which were about hym at conclusion were slayne.
But he hymselfe glad to saue his lyfe brake forth alone from among ye myddes of his ennemies: and from wepyns and dartes with great difficuly.
¶But in the meane tyme Marius had ouercome driuen away the horsmen which assayled hym.
Wherfore anone he re+turned fiersly to helpe and socours of his company whome he vnderstode somwhat put backe by viole~ce of their ennemies.
But he by his policy and valiant dedes anone so reconforted his men that none of his ennemies were able to withstande their violence in any part of that batayle.
¶Thus finally the romayns after great labour and many greuous woundes disconfited their ennemies on euery syde.
But whan the batayle was ended and the romayns began to pursue the chase: than verily it was a pytefull and horrible syght to beholde in the open feldes and to consyder the cruel spectacle of batayle.
Howe some fled: Some pursued some inraged murdring some rored dyeng some slayne some taken prisoners.
The horse and men mengled togyder: labouring in the panges of deth.
The ground ouerspred with deed corpses mangled mutulate and horribly hewyn: inuolued in blode co~geled.
The horse wounded: as mad drewe after them the deed carcases of their maisters their legges hangyng in the styropes and their speares halfe thorowe their bodyes trayling after in the dust.
The coursers wounded and fleyng cast vp with their fete the dust tempered with blode rennyng ouer the deed bodyes of their lordes.
Many of the Numidie~s which were sore wounded coude neyther fle: nor be suffred to take rest on the grounde.
Somtyme they laboured to ryse auoyde: and anone after for feblenes fel downe to the ground agayne: eche rowlyng turnyng in other blode.
And finally: as far as any mannes syght myght extende al the grounde was ouerspred and couered with armour wepen and deed caryons rennyng of blode.
And al the ground infect with the same horryble to beholde.
¶Howe Bocchus after that he was thus twyse ouercom in batel purposed to make peace with the romains: and howe at his request Marius sende vnto hym Sylla and Manlius to knowe his mynde in that behalfe.
AFter that this batel was thus ended to the vtter damage distruction of the Numidyans: and to the laude honour of the romayns.
Marius was nowe without dout ouercomer victour and went vnto the towne of Cirtha as his iournay and purpose was at first begynnyng before these two batayls.
Whan Marius had soiourned there fyue dayes aft this batayle: there came vnto hym embassadors fro~ kyng Bocchus.
Whiche in their kyng{is} behalfe desyred of Marius to sende vnto hym two of the most trusty men whiche he had: sayng that he wold co~men treate with them of dyuers besynesses both for his owne profet for {pro}fet aua~tage of the romains also.
Marius without tary sende forth Sylla for one: and Aulus Manlius for an other.
Whan they were come to kyng Bocchus: howbeit he had sende for them to co~men with them in his maters.
Neuertheles it was co~cluded bytwene them to speke to hym first to thentent to kyndell and inflame his mynde the more agaynst Iugurth: or els seyng hym somwhat desyrous and wyllyng to haue peace to prouoke hym wt more desyre therto.
Wherfore Sylla (to whom Manlius gaue place nat for his age bur for his eloquence) began spake to Bocchus in maner: as foloweth.
¶Of the wordes of Sylla tresourer of the roma+yne army had before kyng Bocch{us}.
KIng Bocchus we haue great gladnes and ioye syth it is so that the goddes haue thus admonisshed enspired you so noble a man that at last ye haue reputed peace better more acceptable than war lest ye myght dishonest defyle your worthynesse by associating yourselfe to the moost vnhappy tyran Iugurth.
And also we ar glad that ye haue auoyded the occasion necessite: wherby we were moued to pursue in batayle: you beyng ignorant of our quarel: and in the co~pany of ye sayd most cursed Iugurth tyran ennemy to thempyre of Rome.
And certenly ye people of Rome euer syth their poore simple smal begynning haue thought it better to wyn fre~des than serua~tes or bondmen and also they haue thought it a moch surer thyng to haue vnder their empire suche as wyllingly of their owne mocion wolde yelde the~selfe: than such as they haue co~strayned therto agaynst their wyl.
But verily no frendshyp is more necessary to you than our amyte or frendshyp.
At first of al: bycause we and ye be farre in sonder: wherby we shal haue les power to greue you or to put you to any charge: by reason of our frendshyp.
But our fauour thankes may be as redy to you: as if we were nere togyder: co~sydering the many great frendes whiche we haue nat far from your marches.
And also vnto thempire of Rome be obeyers subgettes seruantes abundantly.
But as touchyng louers frendes we nor none other can haue sufficiently ynough.
For this consideracion kynge Bocchus your fre~dshyp shalbe more acceptable vnto vs.
And wolde god it had pleased you thus to haue done at the begynning of this war
Forsoth if ye had so done: than shulde ye before this tyme haue receyued of the romayns mo co~modites auantages and good dedes than ye haue nowe suffred losse damages or hurtes.
But whyle it is so that mannes dedes besynesses (for the moost part) be ruled by fortune: to whiche fortune it hath pleased that ye shuld both proue and assay our myght and violence in batayle: and also our loue fauour in peace: Therfore nowe syht amytie is proferred to you by suffraunce of fortune: and syth it is lauful to you to take it: be nat slowe from hens forwarde but hastely procede as ye haue begon: that ye may proue the romayns frendes to you lyke as ye haue proued them ennemies before this tyme.
Ye haue many expedient oportunites necessary co~modites by whome ye may make amendes wt your good dedes for that ye haue offe~ded agaynst the romayns ouerpasse your olde fautes with newe kyndnesses and benefites: and finally fix this in your hert that ye or any other shal neuer ouercome the peple of Rome with kyndnes or good dedes.
And as touchynge their hatered and of what myght they ar in batayle: yet yourselfe knowe that by profe experience.
Wherfore procede in acquiring of their frendshyp: whiche gladly shalbe graunted vnto you if your merites shal so deserue.
¶Of the answere of Bocchus made to Sylla: and of the vnstablenesse of mynde of the same Bocchus.
TO these wordes of Sylla answered Bocchus myldely and soberly: and a fewe wordes he spake in excusing his offence done agayne the romayns sayeng that he had nat taken armour nor begon war agaynst them as ennemy to do iniury or wrong vnto them: but to defende his owne kyngdome.
And that the thirde part of Numidy belonged vnto hym by lawe of armes: of the which the romayns laboured to expel Iugurth.
And in that doyng they distroyed his part of the contrey: whiche he coude nat suffer vnreuenged.
Moreouer Bocchus sayd for hymselfe that he had sende vnto Rome before to require amyte and frendshyp of the romayns: which thing vnto hym was denyed.
But at co~clusion he sayd: that he wolde omyt lay a part al olde malyce that althyng shulde be done and agreed bytwene them: yf Marius wolde grau~t hym that his embassadours might be sende to Rome: for the sayd frendship to be co~federate with ye romains.
Vpon this answere Sylla his felawe retourned to Marius whiche anone agreed yt the same embassadors shuld be se~t to Rome.
But shortly after: what tyme Iugurth vnderstode of the co~myng of Sylla Manlius he feared the same thyng whiche was ordend in hande.
And anone wt rewardes so he corrupted the frendes of Bocchus: that agayn they chau~ged his mynde with their counsel: so mutable and variable was he of mynde.
¶How Bocchus chan~ged his purpose yet ones agayne: and sende newe embassadours to Marius to treat of the peace: and howe Sylla receyued and treated them in absence of Marius.
IN the meane tyme Marius set and ordred his hoost in their wyntring places toke wt hym such men as were of lyght harnesse: and also a part of his horsemen: with them went into a desart nat far thens to besige a certayne towre belongyng to Iugurth: into whiche towre the sayd Iugurth had put for garnyson defence: al the treators which had forsaken fled from the romayns to Iugurth.
But in the mean whyle Bocchus of new agayne co~sydred in mynde the misfor+tune whiche had hapened to hym i~ the two batayls before.
Or els by counsel of some other of his frendes: whome Iugurth had nat corrupted with reward{is}: he chose forth among al .v. men whose fidelite trueth he had wel knowen often proued before: and whose wysdome was most expert redy.
Them sende he to Marius: co~mau~ded them afterwarde if the mater required as embassadors to take their way to Rome: and co~mitted to them his ful authorite in euery thyng which was to be done: and to co~clude the war by what euer maner shuld seme best and moost expedie~t to their discrecion.
These embassadours toke spedely toke their iournay to the places where the romayns soiourned the wynter season.
But whyle they wer i~ their iournay thyderwarde: they were assay+led of theues of the getulians and robbed spoyled of al that they had about them.
Thus at last without worshyp or apparel: all affrayed abasshed they fled vnto Sylla for refuge.
This Sylla was left by Marius in the wynteryng places: to be ruler of the romayne army in his absence.
What tyme these embassadors: thus spoyled were come to Sylla for refu+ge he receyued them nat fayntly as vayne vnstable ennemies as they deserued: but curteysly with moch gentylnes liberalite treatynge them in al poyntes honorably.
By this meanes these barbaria~s rude people counted and supposed that the name of couetyse whiche was imputed vnto the romayns by co~men fame was but false fayned of their ennemies to distayne their honour.
And also for the moch liberalite of Sylla: they counted hym as their special frende.
For yet vnto that tyme: the accloyeng of gyftes gyuen for rewardes for policy falshode to ouerco~e couetous or simple myndes was vnknowen vnto many.
No man was liberal i~ gyft{is}: but that he was thought cou~ted to be faythful of hert withal.
Thus the barbarians reputed the liberte reward{is} of Sylla to be a great euident token of loue which he had to them: as they demed.
But to our purpose: the embassadours anone opened declared to Sylla the wyl co~maundeme~t of Bocchus their kyng: gyuen to them to be excuted: And also they required hym to be vnto them a frendly fauourer counsellour in their besynesse.
Farthermore with their wordes and spech they co~mended exalted the army the trueth the greatnes excellence of their kyng: and al other thyng{is} which they thought might auayle them to optayne benyuole~ce of the romayns.
After they remayned with Sylla about the space of xl. dayes: whiche graunted them al his helpe and socour and also in the mean space enfourmed them in what maner they shulde order their wordes whan they shulde speke with Marius and also before the senatours at Rome.
¶How Marius harde them bassadours of Bocchus sende them to Rome: and how they were answered of the senatours.
IN the mean tyme Marius whiche was in assaut of the kynges towre coude nat perfourme his enterprise.
Wherfore he retour+ned againe to Cirtha: anone was he certified of co~myng of the imbassadours of Bocchus.
Wherfore he co~maunded them Sylla also to come before hym: and also he called togyder all the moost worthy men of his hole hoost from euery place.
Before them al presently he co~maunded the imbassadours of Bocchus to reherse the petycion of their kyng (which rehersed harde) it was graunted vnto them to go Rome for the same poyntes.
And of Marius was truesse required in the meane tyme bytwene Bocchus and hym.
fewe other fiersly and sharply cou~selled otherwyse: as men without pyte and ignorant of others harde fortune whiche whan it begynneth to be frowarde and contrary: it tourneth euery thynge to aduersyte.
¶But whan ye mauriens had obtayned of Marius al their desyre: thre of them went to Rome with one named Octauyus Rufo: whom Marius had assigned to conuey the~ thyder This Octauyus Rufo was sende before from Rome into Affrike to Marius with wages for the soudyours.
The other two imbassadors of Bocchus returned home agayne to their kyng: whiche of them gladly harde of the good report whiche they made of the Romayns in euery poynt: and specially of the good wyl lyberalite and courtesy of Sylla.
¶But whan the other thre imbassadours were come to Ro~e they apered before the senatours and in the humblest wyse yt they coude deuise dyd their message excusynge their kynge: and confessyng that he had offended agaynst the empyre nat by his owne sekyng: but by the cursed faut prouocacion and instygation of Iugurth: wherof their kynge sore repented.
Wherfore in his behalfe at conclusyon they besought the romayns of pardon amyte and peace.
Than was it brefely answered to them in this maner.
¶The senatours and people of Rome: is wont to remembre both the kyndnesse and benifytes of their fre~des: and also the iniuryes of their ennemies.
But syth it repe~teth and forthynketh Bocchus of his trespas: grace and pardon of his offence is graunted vnto hym.
Peace and amyte shalbe also graunted vnto hym hereafter whan he shal so deserue.
¶How Marius sent Sylla agayne to Bocchus at his desyre: and what danger the same Sylla escaped by helpe of Volux son of kyng Bocchus.
WHan Bocchus vnderstode al these thin+ges: he desyred Marius by his letters to sende vnto hym Sylla: to thentent yt after his aduyse discression cou~sel might be had of the co~men be+synesse to bothe parties belo~gyng.
Sylla anone was send forth wt a great retynue of fotemen horseme~: with diuerse weapen stronge defe~ce as archars slyngars with otherlike.
And to thynte~t to spede their iournay more hastely: they were al armed wt lightest harnes which coude be {pro}uided but for al the lightnes of their armour it was defe~site ynough agaynst the weapyns of the mauryans: for their wepyns be light in likewyse.
But finally whan Sylla had passed fyue dayes of his iournay: sodenly Volux the son of Bocchus apered and shewed hymselfe to the romayns in the open feldes: with no mo but.
M. men which went scatered and dyspersed abrode neglyge~tly: so that they semed to Sylla: and al other a greatter nombre than they were in dede.
Sylla and al his company feared them thinkynge them ennemies: wherfore the romayns made them redy with armour and weapen: to defende themselfe and to resyst their ennemies: if nede shulde so requyre.
lytel feare was amonge them: but their hope and confort ouerpassed their feare.
For why? they had the vpper hande before: and consydred that they shulde bycker with them whome they had often ouerthrowen and ouercome before.
In the meane tyme the horsemen whiche were sent before of both parties to espy ye trueth of the mater certified eche of them that al thyng was quyet and sure ynough: as it was in dede: without treason or paryl.
Volux in his metyng called Sylla by name: and welcomed hym benyngely sayeng that he was sent from his father Bocchus to mete the sayd Sylla for his honour socour defence.
And so proceded they forthe+warde al this day and the next day after in company togyder without feare or daunger.
But after that it was nyght their tentes pytched: sodenly the maurian Volux came rennyng to Sylla al pale quakyng: and sayd that he was infourmed of the espyes that Iugurth was nat far thens.
And with that prayed exhorted hym to fle away wt hym priuely by nyght.
Sylla denyed that vtterly as fierse and bolde of courage sayeng that he feared nat a cowarde numidyan: which so often had ben ouercome before.
And that he trusted wel ynough to the strength courage of his men: and finally he gaue Volux this answere.
If knewe without dout that our sure distruction were insta~t: and that and myne shuld be slayne in the felde yet wold nat fle for any drede: but rather abyde and dye manfully: than cowardely to flee shame my people of whome haue charge in sparyng our lyues whiche be so incertayne vnsure: and parauenture shortly after this shal fynisshe with some sickenes or dysease.
Is it nat better to dye in a noble quarel manly tha~ to lyue i~ shame cowardly? Whan Sylla had thus answered: than Volux cou~selled hym to depart from that place to remoue forward by nyght.
Therto Sylla co~sented: and anone co~maunded his soudyours to refresshe them in their tentes with such vitels as they had and to make plenty of fiers ouer al the place to the intent that yf their ennemies were nere: in beholdyng the fiers they shulde thynke that they wolde nat remoue thens that nyght.
But in the first hour of the night Sylla co~maunded al his soudyors to leaue their fiers brennynge and so to depart forwarde in their iournay with scilence: so they dyd.
And went al the night long: and euyn with the sonne rysinge they al beyng weryed: Sylla pytched his tentes agayne.
With that certayne horsemen of the mauriens brought word that Iugurth had taken place to his tentes: and rested about the distance of two myle before them.
Whan these tidynges were harde among the romayns: a meruelous great fear entred the myndes of them al.
Many aduysed to take pu+nissheme~t of Volux: sayeng that it was a thyng vnworthy to suffre hym to escape vnpunysshed for so great a myschefe and treason agaynst them commytted.
But howbeit that Sylla was inwardly of the same opynion: neuertheles he defended the maurian from dammage.
And exhorted his men to be of strong bolde myndes: sayeng that often before that tyme it had ben sene that a fewe worthy men had won victory of a mo+che multitude of coward{is}.
And howe moch the lesse that they spared their bodyes in batayle fro fightyng: somoch the surer shuld they be: and that it semed no man to whome god natu+re had gyuen handes to defende his body: to sicke defence in his fete vnarmed by rennyng away.
And that in suche a ieopardy a noble soudyour ought nat to tourne away his body from his ennemy though he were naked and vnarmed.
¶Whan Sylla had exhorted his men with suche wordes: he called vnto hym Volux: and called in to wytnesse Iupyter and al his ydols to recorde the falshode and treason of Bocchus father of Volux: which had so betrayed hym.
Than for asmoch as Sylla supposed that Volux had brought hym by treason into handes of Iugurth by counsel co~maundement of his father Bocchus he co~maunded Volux anone to depart from his co~pany syght Volux pytuously wepyng: besought Sylla nat to byleue suche thing{is} in hym: sayd that certenly by gyle nor by treason was nothyng done of him nor of his fa+ther: but rather by Iugurth which by his subtilte had espyed serched their iournay wayes by his espies so knowen the same.
But at co~clusion said Volux: syth it is so that Iugurth hath no great co~pany that his hope his trust confort for ye moost part dependeth on my father: thinke that he shal nat be so bolde to do any damage to you openly whyle am in your co~pany: which may recorde his ded{is} to my father.
Wher+fore Sylla to thentent that ye may parceyue that no treason is in me: shal openly go with you alone by ye myddes of the tentes of Iugurth so sauely conuey you: and other se~de my folke before: or els leaue the~ hexe with your company whyther of both shal please you best.
This cou~sel was alowed of Syl+la: anone without tary he proceded forwarde with al his co~pany through myddes of the tentes of Iugurth.
And bycause this was sodenly done: Iugurth nat knowyng therof before he meruayled moch therat: douted long what was to be done.
But at last he suffred the romayns to passe to escape saufe and sou~de for loue of Volux and drede of Bocchus his father.
And within a fewe dayes after: Volux and Sylla with their company came to Bocchus: whether they intended.
¶Of the metyng and secrete apoyntmentes bytwene Bocchus and Sylla: and howe bytwene them both they abused Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth.
AT the same season was with Boc+chus a certayne numidyan named Asper sende before Bocchus fro~ Iugurth by craft and subtylte: to espy his cou~sel assone as it was hard that Bocchus had sende for Syl+la.
This numidyan was moch familierly co~uersa~t with Bocchus at that tyme.
Moreouer there was an other named Dabar the son of Massagrade: which of his fathers syde was of the stocke of Massinissa.
But of his mothers syde vnlyke of byrth: for his mother was borne of a co~cubine.
This Dabar (as haue sayd) was at this season also in the co~pany of Bocchus: and to hym dere and welbeloued for subtel wyt and great actes whiche he had done before: and namely bycause that Bocchus had founde proued hym trusty faythful many tymes before.
Anone Boc+chus sende this Dabar to Sylla commaundyng Dabar to shewe hym yt he was redy to do euery thyng which ye romains to hym wolde co~maunde or assigne.
And that Sylla hymself shuld apoynt chose a tyme place where they might co~men togyder of their maters: and that he shulde nat fere nor dout though the embassadoure of Iugurth were there with hym.
For he had reserued all thyng{is} touchyng their cou~sel hole tyll co~myng of Sylla: of nothyng had apoynted co~muned nor co~cluded with the same imbassadour of Iugurth.
Which imbassadour was called thyder to thyntent that their co~men besynesses might be done more at lybertie with lesse suspection of Iugurth: for by other meanes they coude nat resyst nor ma+ke {pro}uision agaynst his gyles.
Such wordes sende Bocchus to Sylla: by his trusty seruant Dabar.
But natwtstandynge al these fayre promisses of Bocchus it was vnderstande yt he {pro}longed the romayns the numidyans in hope of peace rather for falshode treason after the crede~ce of affrycans: than for profet to the romayns or trouth of such thyng{is} as he {pro}mysed to Sylla.
And often tymes he cast in his mynde douted whether he might betray Iugurth to ye romayns: or els Syl+la to Iugurth: the pleasure desyre of his mynd aduised moued cou~selled hym agaynst the romayns: but the drede whi+che he had of punisshment in tyme to come: moued hym with ye romayns.
But to our purpose: Sylla answered to Dabar the messanger of Bocchus that the wolde come thyder firste speke a lytel of the peace of suche other thynges in prese~ce of Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth: but co~cernyng the remenant of the besynesse: he wolde dyffer that to co~men secretly wt Bocchus fewe or none called to counsel.
And also he taught Dabar what wordes Bocchus shulde answere vnto hym agayne whan they shulde come to co~municacion: and so departed Dabar.
But whan Sylla sawe his tyme he went to Bocchus and sayd that he was sent from Marius the consul to enquire if he wold leuer peace or war: and wheron he wold co~clude.
Than Bocchus (as Dabar had warned hym before) co~mau~ded Sylla to retourne agayne afterd .x. dayes: and tha~ shulde an answere be gyuen vnto hym.
That answere wel noted harde Asper the embassadour of Iugurth whiche was sent to espy the intreatement: and so thought he that nothyng shulde be treated nor co~cluded without his knowlege.
And thus after this answere Bocchus and Sylla departed: eche to their tentes.
¶Of the seconde co~myng togyder of Bocchus and of Sylla: and of the wordes of Bocchus had to Sylla: and replycation and answere of Sylla agayne to hym.
And how Bocchus graunted concluded to betray Iugurth to the romayns.
BVt after that moche of the night was ouerpassed: Bocchus priuely sende for Sylla none beyng in their company saue such as on both parties myght truely interprit and declare the sentence and vnderstandyng of their word{is}.
And also Dabar the sayd messanger was present whiche solemly swore and promised to be faythful interpretour of both their sayenges and sentences.
¶I haue thought forsoth: that it shulde neuer haue fortuned that the greattest kynge of al them in these landes: and rychest of al them that knowe: shuld haue ben bounde a mean priuate person.
And forsoth Sylla or euer hard of you: haue gyuen helpe socours to many other men.
And to some other: required of them: my selfe nat nedyng helpe of any man.
But now syth haue knowen you: haue nede of your helpe and frendshyp of which am glad: nat withstandyng other men ar wont to be sory of such fortune.
And certenly this nede whi+che haue of your frenshyp is nat of me counted damage nor losse: but moche profet and pleasure.
For inwardly in my mynde nothyng is derer nor more acceptable: whiche ye may conueniently proue if it please you: demand take of me armour men treasour: and finally what euer it pleaseth you in your mynde: and vse occupy the same as your owne.
And thynke ye for certayne that whyle ye lyue togyder: can neuer render worthy thankes vnto your kyndnes: nor condignely recompence your great humanite: but euer my good wyl mynde shalbe hole and newe agaynst you.
And certenly if may knowe your mynde wyl: ye shal nought nede to de+syre of me: shal preuent your requestes with my benefytes: so that ye shal coueyt nothyng in vayne.
Verely as thynke it is lesse reprouable and lesse dyshonour a kyng to be ouerco~e with armour: than with liberalite.
Wherfore haue concluded in mynde that a man shal rather ouercome me in batayle with weapen force of armes: than with liberalite.
¶But touchyng your commen wayle (for whose besynes ye be sende hyther as procuratour of the same) this is my senten+ce and mynde in fewe wordes.
Agaynst the romayns nor agaynst their empire: neuer moued nor made war: nor to make batayle agaynst them: it was neuer i~ my mynde by my wyl.
But the boundys of my marchesse haue endeuoured me to defende agaynst the violence of your armed men.
But this leaue set a syde: syth se that it pleaseth you to do the same: execute continue ye batayle with Iugurth as ye wyl.
And as touchyng me: shal nat ouerpasse the water of Mulucha whiche was boundes bytwene my marches and Micipsa whyle he lyued.
Nor into my countrey shal nat suffre Iugurth from hens forthe: to entre for socours as he hath done in tymes passed.
Farthermore if ye desyre any thyng of me conueniently: which may worthely graunt my royalte nat distayned: it shal nat be denyed vnto you.
¶Vnto these wordes Sylla answered for his owne part but moderately and with fewe wordes.
But touchyng the peace and besynesse concernyng the commen wayle: he spake many wordes wherof the conclusion was suche.
¶Kynge Bocchus insure and promesse you: that the romayns shal nat be vnkynde to you if ye do some pleasure to them: which may rather long to the~ al holly in comen: than in me alone.
And thynke ye for certayne: that they whiche haue ouercome you in batayle: shal lykewyse ouercome you wt libe+ralite kyndnesse and good dedes: if ye so contende with the~: which thyng is nowe redy in your power to do: consydering that haue Iugurth redy at your wyl and pleasure.
Therfore among al benefites or pleasurs: ye can do none more acceptable vnto the romayns: than to delyuer vnto theym Iugurth.
By this meanes shal they be moche beholden to you: and thynke ye stedfastly: it shal nat be vnrewarded on our behalfe.
For than shal the Senate graunt vnto you amyte and peace: and also a part of numidy whiche ye do nowe clayme: shul than be graunted vnto you vnrequired.
¶Bocchus heryng these wordes of Sylla: first excused him selfe by the affinyte whiche was bytwene hym and Iugurth: and by the longe familyarite aquayntance whiche they had togyder: sayeng also that a bonde of peace was confyderate and sworne bytwene them.
And also that he fered suspected that if he so dyd: his owne subgett{is} shulde hate hym therfore whiche moche loued Iugurth: greatly hated the romayns.
But nat withstandyng these wordes of Bocchus: Sylla desysted nat to attyse and counsel hym: tyl at last he agreed and co~sented to his desyre promysing to do euery thyng as requyred hym.
But to thyntent to fayne a treaty of peace (of whiche Iugurth weryed in warre was moche desyrous) they ordayned suche craft: as to their purpose semed most expedyent.
But whan they had ymagined and deuysed al thynges after theyr myndes: than both they departed in sonder: and retourned agayne to their rest.
¶Howe Bocchus betrayed Iugurth and delyuered hym bounde to Sylla.
ON the morowe after Bocchus called to hym Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth and sayd to hym that he vnderstode of Sylly by the interpretacion of Dabar that the war might be vpon certayne co~dicions.
Wherfore he bad hym go inquire the mynde pleasure of his kyng in yt behalfe.
Asper of these tydynges was glad toke leaue of Bocchus: and departed to the tentes of Iugurth: certyfied hym of the same.
Iugurth shewed to Asper al his mynd and pleasure co~cerning the premisses.
And within .viii. dayes aft sende hym agayne to Bocchus.
Whan Asper was retourned agayne to Bocchus: he shewed to him ye wyl of Iugurth sayeng that he coueted to do althyng whiche shuld be co~mau~ded to hym of Bocchus: but he had but smal co~fyde~ce in Marius.
For asmoche as the peace whiche often before had ben conue~ted apoynted of the romayne captayns had anone after ben frustrate: broken of the~ agayne.
But if ye wyll (sayd Asper to Bocchus) that peace shalbe confermed of the romayns wt Iugurth you also: Iugurth desyreth requireth you to labour so: that Sylla Iugurth ye: may come togyder to co~munycation: as if it were to treat of peace that ye wyl there betraye and delyuer Sylla to hym.
For if ye may ones bring such a man into power handes of Iugurth: anone after it shall fortune without dowte that peace shalbe made and grau~+ted to him by co~men assent of the senatours: co~mens of Rome also.
And that: to thynte~t to recouer Sylla agayne out of the ha~des of Iugurth.
For without dout ye romayns wyl nat suffre so noble a man to be left in handes danger of their ennemies.
And namely: whan they shal vnderstande hym take~ nat by his owne folly nor cowardyse: but in besynesse belongynge to the commen wayle.
¶Bocchus heryng these wordes: reuolued cast lo~g in min de what he might answere to the~: but at last he grau~ted therto But whether he douted so long before he grau~ted for subtylte or very trouth it is harde to discerne.
But this is playnly knowen yt for the moost part in likewyse as the wylles myn+des of kyng{is} be veheme~t immoderat hasty: right so be they mouyng vnstedfast variable: and often aduers co~trary to their owne selfe: and with the~selfe repugna~t.
But to our mater: Bocchus assigned to Asper a place tyme: where Sylla and they shuld co~men togyder of the peace.
And in the meane whyle somtyme he co~muned secretly with Sylla: somtyme wt Asper embassadour of Iugurth treatyng them both mekely and courtesly: and {pro}misyng one self thyng vnto them both.
Wherfore they both wer glad: and also eche of them both had good hope in the promysses of Bocchus.
¶But the nygh before that day: whiche was assigned to intreatme~t of the peace: Bocchus called vnto hym diuerse of his frendes as if he wold haue taken cou~sel of them: and than immediatly he chau~ged that mynde co~maundyng them agayne to auoyde from hym.
And so (none of his cou~sel about hym) he stode al alone reuoluyng tourning i~ mynde many thyng{is} by hymselfe chau~gyng oftentymes in contenau~ce and colour variable diuerse: aperyng forthward by tokens of feare co~ceyued in his mynde expressed by outwarde tokens of his body.
In so moche: that al yf he expressed nat his mynde by wordes: neuertheles this often changing of cou~tena~ce declared the secretes of his hert.
But at co~clusion: after long co~fly had within hymselfe: at last he co~maunded Sylla to be called vnto hym.
And than aft his aduyse cou~sel he deuised prepared althyng{is} co~cernyng the prodicion of Iugurth.
¶After this cou~sel co~cluded: assone as the day light apered· tidynges were brought to Bocchus that Iugurth was nat far thens: and commynge towarde hym.
Bocchus this herynge: anone prepared hymselfe and proceded forth agaynst hym accompanyed with a fewe of his frendes and also with Sylla: fayninge that he went so forth to mete with Iugurth and to receyue hym bycause of honour.
And thus they proceded forwarde: tyl at last they came to an opyn heyth where they myght easely se the commyng of Iugurth: whiche place was apoynted before to their treason.
For in dyuerse valeys of the same heyth: were armed men lyenge in wayt redy and apoynted before by Bocchus: for to assayle Iugurth and his company whan signes shuld be gyuen to them: to yssue forth of their lurkyng places.
Anone Iugurth with many of his men about hym came to ye same place al vnarmed: as apoynte+ment was made before.
For it was ordayned that Bocchus Iugurth and Sylla: shulde come togyder to co~municacion: eche one with a smal company and al vnarmed.
¶Anon as Iugurth was come thyder: kyng Bocchus gaue a token to his men which lay in wayt for Iugurth.
Anone as they harde the token: sodaynly they bracke forth and inuaded Iugurth and his co~pany: compasynge them about on euery syde.
Without great labour: al the company of Iugurth were murdred: and he hymselfe taken and bounde hande and fote and so delyuerd vnto Sylla: whiche without tary led hym forth and delyuerd hym vnto Marius: whose hert was replenysshed and inuironed with ioye inestimable.
¶How Marius was receyued into Rome with triumphe: and howe Iugurth was cast into prison: where he contynued in myserable captiuite tyl he dyed.
AFter that Iugurth thus bounde was delyuered by Bocchus vnto Sylla: and than to Marius.
Anone al the numidyans submytted and yelded themselfe to the romayns.
Marius with great wysedome set an order among the people and garnysshed and fortified the townes: and than with the remanent of his army toke his iournay agayne to Rome: leadyng Iugurth and his two sonnes bounde with hym: with innumerable other prisoners great treasour olyphantes and armoure: whiche he had won in the war of Iu+gurth.
But after that tidynges were brought to Rome: howe the war was ended in Numidy: and howe Iugurth was led thyderwarde bounde and prisoner.
Anone the Senate and commens assembled to counsel: and Marius was create consul agayne for the next yere: in his absence.
And by decre and ordynaunce: the prouince of Fraunce was commytted vnto hym to be recouered.
¶For the same tyme whyle Marius warred in Numidy: and toke Iugurth prisoner.
That cou~trey of France (whose people that tyme were named Cymbrians) rebelled agaynst the empyre of Rome.
Agaynst whome the romayns sende forth to represse their rebellion: a great army with two capitayns: the one named Quintus Scipio the other Marcus Manlyus: whiche at last with frowarde fortune had a great and greuous batayle with the same frenchmen Cymbrians.
In which both these romayne capitayns were ouercome· and twyse lost the felde.
Of the romayns men of war: were slayne .lxxx. thousande: of tylmen and pages .xl. thousande.
Thus was this batayle foughten with so yl fortune vnto the romayns: that the cite of Rome and al the countrey of Italy trembled for feare therof.
In somoche that both the romains which lyued at that tyme: and al their progeny whiche succeded them: counted al other nacions redy to their obesance: and to wyn honour by them: but they thought neuer to contende in batayle with this nacion of frenchmen: to wynne glorie or honour by them: but rather to defende themselfe and their libertie: whiche thynge if they myght do they counted themselfe fortunate.
Wherfore (as haue before recounted) the Senate: and commens of Rome decreed this prouince of France to Marius for to reuenge the deth of their men: and to recouer the countrey.
¶But (to our purpose) whan Marius shulde intre into Ro+me he was ioyfully receyued with great glorie and triumphe: wherof the order was suche.
Marius hymselfe was set on hye in a golden chayre: whiche was drawen of foure whyte palfrayes.
Iugurth and his two sonnes with many other noble men: whome he brought captyue from Numidy proceded before his chariot: their handes and armes bounde as pri+soners.

Igitur bello Numantino Micipsa quum populo ro+mano equitu~ at{que} peditu~ auxilia mitteret: sperans vel oste~dendo virtute~: vel seuitia: eum occasuru~: prefecit quos in Hispaniam mittebat.

IGitur rex vbi ea quae fama ex litteris imperatoris esse ita cognouit: tum virtute, tum gratia viri permo+tus flexit animum suum. Iugurtham beneficijs vincere aggressus est.
Statim{que} eum adoptauit: et testamento pariter cu~ filijs haeredem instituit.
Sed ipse paucos post annos morbo at{que} aetate co~fectus: cum sibi finem vite adesse intelligeret: coram amicis et cognatis: item{que} Adherbale et filijs, dicitur huiuscemodi verba cum Iugurtha habuisse.
PAruu~ ego Iugurtha te amisso patre: sine spe: sine opibus: in meum regnu~ suscepi: existimans non minus me tibi: {quam} liberis (si genuissem) ob beneficia charum fore.
Nam vt alia magna et egregia facta omitta~) nouissime tu rediens Nu mancia me{que}, regnum{que} meum gloria decorasti: tua{que} virtute Romanos ex amicis amicissimos fe cisti.
In Hispania nome~ familiae nostre renouatum est: postremo (quod difficilimum inter mortales est) gloria inuidiam vicisti.
Nunc (quoniam mihi natura finem vitae facit) per hanc dexteram: per regni fidem moneo: obtestor{que} te: vti hos qui genere tibi propinqui beneficio meo fratres sunt: charos habeas.
Non exercitus ne{que} thesauri presidia regni su~t. Verum amici, quos ne{que} armis cogere, ne{que} auro parare queas: officio et fi de pariuntur.
Quis autem amicitior {quam} frater fratri? Aut quem alienum inuenies: si tuis hostis fueris· Equide~ ego vobis regnu~ trado firmum si boni eritis: sin mali imbecillum.
Caeterum Iugurtha ante hos te (quia aetate et sapi entia priores) ne aliter quid eueniat prouidere decet.
Nam in omni certamine qui opulentior est: etiam si accipit iniuriam tame~ (quia plus potest) facere videtur.
Vos autem Adherbal et Hiempsal colite et obser+uate hunc talem virum: imitamini virtutem: et ne ego meliores liberos sumpsisse videar: {quam} genuisse.
Ad ea Iugurtha tametsi regem ficta locutum intel+ligebat: et ipse longe aliter in animo agitabat, ta+men pro tempore benigne respondit.
Post{quam} illi regio more iusta magnifice fecera~t: reguli in vnum conueniu~t: vt inter se de cu~ctis nego tijs disceptarent.
Sed Hiempsal, qui minimus ex illis erat: natura ferox: etiam antea ignobilitatem Iugurthae: quia materno genere impar erat: despiciens: dextera Adherbale~ assedit, ne ex tribus (quod apud Numidas honori ducit Iugurtha foret· Deinde tamen vt aetati co~cederet fatigatus a fra+tre: vix in partem altera~ traductus est.
Ibi cum multa de administrando imperio dissere re~t: Iugurtha inter alias res ait: oportere qui~quen nij co~sulta et decreta oi~a rescindi.
Nam per ea tempora co~fectum annis Micipsam parum animo valuisse.
Tum Hia~psal placere sibi respondit: nam ipsum illum his tribus proximis annis adoptione in regnum peruenisse.
Quod verbum in pectus Iugurthae altius {quam} quis{quam} ratus erat descendit.
Ita{que} ex eo tempore ira et metu anxius: moliri parare at{que} ea modo i~ animo habere: quibus Hiempsal per dolum capere+tur.
Que vbi tardi{us} proce+du~t: ne{que} lenitur animus ferox: statuit quouis modo inceptum perficere.

Ita{que} tempus ad vtra~{que} discernitur sed maturius ad pe+cuniam distribuendam.
Sed Hiempsal in oppido Thirmida forte eius domo vtebatur qui proxim{us} lictor Iugurthae: charus acceptus{que} ei sem per fuerat.

Tum Iugurtha peractis consilijs post{quam} omni Numidia pociebatur: i~ ocio facinus suum i~ animo reputa~s: timere populu~ romanu~: ne{que} aduersus ira~ eius vs{quam}· nisi in auaricia nobilitatis: et pecunia sua spem habere.
Ita{que} paucis diebus post cu~ auro et arge~to multo Romam legatos mittit: quibus precepit primum vti veteres amicos mune+ribus repleant: deinde no+uos exquirant.
Sed vbi legati Romam venere: et ex praecepto re+gis hospitib{us} alijsq· quo ru~ ea tempestate in senatu authoritas pollebat: magna munera misere: Tanta commutatio incessit: vt ex maxima inui+dia et maliuole~tia in gra+tiam et fauorem nobilitatis Iugurtha veniret.
Quoru~ pars spe alij premio inducti: singlos ex senatu ambiendo nitebantur: ne grauis in cum con+suleretur.
Igitur vbi legati satis confidunt: die co~stituto· senatus vtris{que} datur.
PAtres conscripti Micipsa meus mo+riens regni tantu~modo procurationem existimarem meam· Caeterum ius et imperium eius penes vos esse populum{que} romanum· simul vobis domi militiae{que} {quam} maximo vsui esse: vos mihi cognatoru~ et affinium loco ducere~.
Si ea fecisse~: in vestra amicitia exercitum diuitias munimen+ta regni me habiturum.
Quae praecepta patris cu~ Iugurtha (homo oi~um: quos terra sustinet: sceleratissimus) co~tempto vestro imperio Massinissae me nepotem a stirpe socium at{que} amicu~ populi romani: regno for runis{que} omnibus expulit.
At{que} ego patres co~scripti (quoniam eo miseriarum ve~turus eram) vellem po tius ob mea {quam} ob maioru~ beneficia meorum· posse me auxilium a vobis petere: ac mihi beneficia a populo romano quibus vtinam non egerem.
Sed quoniam paru~ tuta {per} probitas est: ne{que} mihi in manu fuit: qualis foret Iugurtha: ad vos co~+fugi patres co~scripti: qui bus (quod mihi miserrimum est) cogor prius one ri {quam} vsui esse.
Caeteri reges aut bello vi+cti in amicitiam recepti sunt: aut in suis du bijs re+bus societatem vestram appetiuerunt.
Quorum progeniem vos patres conscripti nolite pati me nepotem Massinissae frustra auxilium Sed si ad impetrandum nihil causae haberem praeter miserandam fortu+nam abquod; paulo a~te ego rex genere, fama, at{que} copijs potens: nunc deformatus erumnis: inops alienas opes expecto.
Tamen erat magestatis populi romani prohibere iniuria~ ne{que} pati cuius{quam} regnum par scelus crescere.
Veru~ ego his finibus eiectus sum: quos maiorib{us} meis populus roman{us} de dit: vnde pater et auus meus vna vobiscum expulere Siphacem et Carthaginenses· vestra beneficia mihi erepta su~t· patres conscripti in mea iniuria despecti estis.
Huccine Micipsa pater beneficiatua euasere· Vt quem tu parem cum liberis regni{que} participem fecisti: is potissimum stirpis tue extinctor sit.
Nun{quam} ne ergo familia nostra quieta erit? Semper ne i~ sanguine, ferro, fuga versabimur? Dum Carthaginenses incolumes fuere iure omnia seua patiebamur: hostes a latere.
Post{quam} illa pestis ex Aphrica eiecta est: leti pa+cem agitabamus: quippe quibus nullus hostis erat nisi illi forte quem vos iussissetis.
Ecce autem ex improuiso: Iugurtha intollera~da audacia, scelere, at{que} superbia sese effe+rens: meo at{que} eodem propinquo suo inter+fecto primum regnu~ eius sceleris sui predam fecit.
Post vbi in eisdem dolis me nequiuerit capere: nihil minus {quam} vim aut bellum expecta~tem in imperio vestro (sicut videtis) extorrem patria, domo i~opem et coopartu~ miserijs effecit: vt vbiuis tuti{us} {quam} in meo regno essem.
Ego sic existimabam patres conscripti vti predi+cantem audiuera~ patrem meu~ qui diligenter colerent amicitiam vestram: eos multu~ laborem suscipere, caeteru~ ex omnibus maxime tutos esse.
Quod in familia nr~a fuit praestitit, vti in omnibus bellis adesset vobis.
Nos vti per ocium tuti simus in manu vestra est.
Patres conscripti pater nos duos fratres reliquit Iugurtha~ beneficijs suis ratus est coniunctum nobis fore.
Alter eorum necatus est, alter ei{us} ipse ego manus impias vix effugi.
Quid agam? aut quo porissimu~ infelix accedam? Generis oi~a presidia extincta sunt.
Fratri quem minime decuit propinquus per scelus vitam eripuit affines, amicos caeteros{que} meos propinquos aliu~ alia cla+de oppressit.
Pars a Iugurtha, pars in crucem acti, et pars bestijs obiecti sunt.
Pauci (quibus relicta est anima) clausi in tenebris: cum merore et luctu mor+te grauiorem vitam exigunt.
Sed si oi~a mihi quae aut amisi, aut quae ex necessarijs aduersa facta su~t incolumia manerent: tamen si quid ex improuiso mali accidisset vos implo rarem patres conscripti quibus pro magnitudine i~perij ius et iniurias oe~s cure esse decet.
Nunc vero exul patria, domo, solus at{que} oi~m honestarum reru~ egens quo accedam aut quos appellem? Naciones ne an reges? qui oe~s familiae nostre ob vestram amicitiam infecti sunt.
An quo{quam} mihi adire licet vbi non meoru~ maiorum monumento hostilia plurima sint.
An quis{que} nostri misereri potest qui aliquando nobis hostis fuit? Postremo Micipsa ita nos instituit patres co~scripti ne quem coleremus nisi populum romanu~: ne societatem, ne{que} federa noua acciperemus: abunde magna presidia nobis in vestra amicitia fore.
Sed si huic imperio fortuna mutaretur: vna occidendum nobis fore.
Oi~a secu~da et obedientia su~t: quo facili{us} sociorum iniurias curare licet.
Tantum illud vereor ne quos priuata amicitia Iu+gurthae parum cognita tra~suersos agat: quos ego audio su~ma ope niti ambire fatigare vos singulos: ne quid de abse~te (incognita causa) statuatis.
me verba: et fugam simulare: cui licuerit in regno manere. &abQUOD vtinam illum (cuius impio facinore in has mi+serias proiectus sum) eadem haec similante~ vide a~: et aliqua~do aut apud vos aut deos immortales: rerum humanaru~ cura oria tur: vt ille qui nunc sceleribus suis ferox at{que} preclarus est omnibus malis ipse excruciatus impieta+tis in parentem nostrum: fratr{is} mei necis: mearu~{que} miseriarum graues penas reddat.
Iamiam frater meo charissime {quam}{quam} tibi immaturo: et vnde minime decuit: vita erepta est tame~ letandum magis {quam} dolen dum casum tuum puto.
Non enim ta~tum regnu~: sed fugam exiliu~ egestatem et has oe~s erumnas (quae me premu~t) cum ani+ma simul amisisti.
At ego infelix in ta~ta mala precipitat{us} ex patrio regno rerum humanatu~ spectaculum prebeo.
Incertus sum quid agam: tuas ne iniurias {per}sequar ipse auxilij egens: an regno consulam: cuius vitae necis{que} potestas ex opib{us} alienis pendet.
Vtinam emori fortunis meis honestus exitus esset: ne viuere contentus si defessus malis iniuriae concessissem.
Nu~c ne{que} viuere libet mi+hi ne{que} mori licet sine dedecore.
Patres conscripti obtestor vos {per} liberos at{que} parentes vestros: {per} magestatem populi romani: subuenite mihi misero.
Ite obuiam iniuriae: nolite pati regnum Numidiae (quod vestru~ est) per scelus et sanguinem familiae nostre tabescere.
POst{quam} rex loquendi finem fecit: legati Iugurthae largitione fre+ti magis {quam} causa paucis respondent, Hiempsalem ob seuitiam suam a Numidis interfectum.
Adherbalem vltro bellu~ inferentem (post{quam} superatus sit) queri, {quod} iniuria~ facere nequiuisset.
Iugurtham ab senatu petere ne se alium putarent ac Numanciae cognitus esset: neu verba inimici ante facta sua ponerent.
Senatus statim consulitur: legatoru~: preterea senat{us} pars gr~a deprauata dicta Iugurthae extollere gia, voce· Deni{que} oi~b{us} modis pro alio scele+re et flagitio: sua quasi pro niteba~tur.
Ac co~+tra: pauci quibus bonu~ et a quu~ diuitijs erat et Hiempsalis morte~ seuere censeba~t.
Sed ex oibus maxi~e Aemilius Scaurus homo no+bilis, impiger, factiosus, auidus pote~tiae, honoris, diuitiarum.
Is post{quam} videt regis largi tionem impude~ tem{que} veritus (quod in ta+li re fieri solet) ne polluta licentia inuidiam accenderet ai~m a consueta libidine continuit: vicit tamen in senatu illa que vero precium aut gratiam
Decretum sit vti dece~ legati regnum quod Micipsa obtinuerat inter Iugurtham et Adherbalem diuiderent: legatio+nis princeps Lucius Opimius: homo clarus: et tum in senatu potens: qui co~sulibus Caio Graccho et flacco interfectis acerrime nobilitatis victoriam in ple+bem exercuerat.
Eum Iugurtha tametsi Romae in inimicis habue+rat: tamen accuratissime accepit.
Dando et pollicendo multa perfecit· vti fame, fidei, postremo om+nibus suis rebus commodum regis anteferret.
Reliquos legatos eadem via aggressus est: pleros{que} capit. paucis charior fides {quam} pecunia erat.
In diuisione regni que {per}s Numidie Mauritaniam attingit agris viris{que} opu+le~tior· Iugurthae tradit
Illam altera~ specie pociorem {quam} vsu: quae portuosior et edificijs magis exornata erat: Adherbal possedit.
Res postulare videtur situm Aphrice paucis exponere: et eas ge~tes quibus cum nobis beslu~ aut amicitia fuit attingere.
Sed que loca et nationes ob calorem et aspiritate~ inter solitudines minus frequentata sunt: de hijs haud facile compertum narrauero.
IN diuisione orbis terrae pleri{que} in parte tertia Aphricam posuere: pauci tantu~modo Asiam et Europa~ esse: sed Aphri+cam in Europa.
Marc seuu~ importuosu~: ager frugu~ fertilis bonus pecori: infecu~+dus: caeli terrae{que} penuria aquarum.
Genus hominum salubri corpore, velox, patie~s la+borum: pleros{que} senectus disioluit: nisi qui ferro aut bestijs interiere.
Sed qui mortales in initio Aphrica~ habuere: qui{que} postea accesserint: aut quomodo inter se {per}mixti sint quam{quam} ab ea fama quae pleros{que} obtinet diuersu~ est tamen vti ex libris punicis qui reg dicebant interpretatum nobis est: vti{que} sese habere cultores ei{us} terre puta~t: {quam} mus dicam.
¶Aphricam habuere in initio Getuli et asperi, inculti{que} quibus cib{us} erat caro ferina: at{que} humi pabulum vti pecotibus.
Hi ne{que} moribus, ne{que} lege, aut imperio cuius{quam} regebantur: vagi, palantes, quo nox coegerat sedes habebant.
Sed postquam in Hispania Hercules (sicuti Aphri puta~t) interijt: exercitus eius co~positus ex varijs gentibus amisso duce: ac passim mult{is} sibi im{per}ium pete~tibus breui dilabit
Ex eo numero Medi, Per se, et Armeni nauibus in Aphrica~ tra~suecti proximos nr~o mari locos occupauere.
Quia ne{que} materia i~ agris, ne{que} ab Hispanis emendi: aut mutua~di copia erat: mare magnu~ et ignara lingua co~mercia prohibebant.
Et quia saepe tentantes agros: alia, deinde alia loca petiuera~t: semetipsi Numidas appellauere.
Caeterum adhuc edificia Numidarum{quam} mappalia illi vocant oblonga· curuis lateribus tecta, quasi nauium carinae sim. Medi aute~ et Armeni accessere Lybes.
Getuli sub sole magis haud procul ab ardoribus: hi{que} mature oppida habuere: nam freto diuisi ab Hispa+nia mutare res inter se constituerant.
Nomen eorum paulatim Lybes corrupere: barbara lingua Mautos pro Medis appellantes.
Sed res Persarum breui adoleuit: ac postea nomine Numide propter multitudinem domi minuendam a pare~tibus possidere ea loca quae pro+xime Carthaginem Numidia appellatur.
Deinde vtri{que} alteris freti finitimos armis, aut metu sub imperium suu~ coegere: nomen, gloria~{que} sibi addidere: mag{is} hi· qui ad nostrum mare processe rant: quia Lybes {quam} Getuli minus erant bellicosi.
Deinde Aphricae pars inferior plera{que} a Numidis possessa est victi omnes in gentem nomen{que} imperantium concessere.
Postea Phenices alij mul+titudinis domi minuende gratia: pars cupidine imperij, solicitata plebe, et alij nouarum re{rum} auidi: Hiponem, Adrumentum, Leptim, vrbes in ora maritima condidere.
Haeque breui multum au+cte: pars originibus suis presidio, alie decori fuere.
Nam de Carthagine silere melius puto, {quam} dicere: quoniam alio properare tempus admonet.
¶Haec tum ex Marone, tum ex Seruio, reliquis{que} probis auctoribus sunt excerpta.
Igitur ad Catabathmon (qui locus Egyptum ab Affrica diuidit secu~dum mare) prima habitatio Cirene e~, Tolonia, Ther con, ac deinde due sunt Syrtes, inter quas Lept{is}, Deinde Philenorum are, quem locu~ Egyptum ver sus finem imperij habuere Carthaginenses.
Post alie Punice vrbes· caetera loca vs{que} ad Mauritaniam Numidae tene~t. proxime Hispania~ Mauri sunt.
Supra Numidiam Getulos accepimus, partim in tugurijs, alios incultius Vagos agitare.
Igitur bello Iugurthino plera{que} ex Punicis oppida: et fines Carthaginensium: quos nouissime habuerant: populus Romanus per magistratus administrabat.
Getulorum magna pars et Numdiae vs{que} ad flumen Mulucha~ sub Iugurtha era~t.
Mauris oi~bus im{per}itabat rex Bocch{us} praeter nome~ per caetera ignar{us} populo romano. item{que}, ne{que} pace, ne{que} bello ante cognitus erat.
De Aphrica et de eiusdem incolis ad necessi tudine~ rei satis dictu~ est.
POst{quam} autem diuiso re+gno legati ab Aphrica discessere: et Iugur+tha co~tra animi timorem premia sceleris adeptum sese videt: certum esse ratus quod ex amicis apud Numantiam acceperat, oi~a Romae venalia esse: simul et illorum pollicitationibus accensus: quos paulo ante munerib{us} expleuerat: in regnum Adherbalis animu~ inte~dit.
At is quem petebat: quietus imbellis, placido i~genio, oportunus iniurie, metue~s magis {quam} metue~dus.
Igitur Iugurtha ex improuiso eius fines cu~ magna manu inuadit: multos mortales cum pecore at{que} alia preda capit: edificia incendit: plera{que} loca hostiliter cum equitatu petit.
Deinde cu~ omnium multitudine in regnu~ suum co~uertit: existimans Adherbalem dolore {per}motu~ iniurias suas vindicaturum eam{que} rem belli causam fore.
At ille: {quod} ne{que} se parem armis existimabat: et amicitia populi ro mani magis {quam} Numidis fretus erat: legatos ad Iu+gurtham de iniurijs questum misi: qui tametsi co~tumeliosa dicta retuleru~t prius tamen omnia pati decreuit {quam} bellum sumere quia tentatum ante secus Ne{que} eo magis cupido Iu+gurthae minuebatur.
Quippe qui totu~ regnum ei{us} animo iam inuaserat· Ita{que} non vti ante cu~ pre datoria manu: sed magno exercitu comparato bellum gerere cepit: et toti{us} imparium Numidiae petere: caeterum qua pergebat: vrbes, agros vastare: predas agere: suis animu~: hostibus terrorem augere.
Adherbal vbi intellexit eo processum: vti regnum aut reliquendum esset: aut armis retinendum necessario copias pa+rat et Iugurthae obuius procedit.
Interim haud longe amari prope Cirtham oppidum vtrius{que} exercitus co~sedit et quia diei extremum erat: prelium non est inceptu~: sed vbi plurimum noctis processit: obscuro etiam tunc lumine: milites Iugurthi ni signo dato castra hostium inuadunt: semiso~nos partim alios sume~tes arma suga~t sundunt{que}.
Adherbal cum paucis equiti+bus Cirtham profugit: et ni multitudo togatorum fuisset: quae Numidas insequentes menibus prohibebat: vno die inter du+os regos ceptum at{que} patratum bellum forer.
Iugurtha oppidum circu~ sedit: vineas, turribus{que} et machinis omnium generum expugnare aggreditur: maxime festinans tempus legatorum ante capere quos ante preliu~ factum ab Adherbale romam missos audiuerat.
SEd post {quam} senatus de bello eorum accepit: tres adolescentes in Aphrica~ lega~tur: qui ambos reges adeant senatus populi{que} romani vrb{is} nu~cie~t censere et velle: eos armis discedere, ita se{que}, illis{que} dignum esse.
Lega ti in Aphricam maturantes veniunt, eo magis {quod} Romae, quum proficisci parant, de prelio facto et oppugnatione Cirthae au+diebatur.
Quorum Iugurtha accepta oratione respondit, sibi ne{que} quic{quam}, ne{que} charius authoritate senatus esse: ab adolescentia ita se enixum: vt ab optimo quo{que}
Virtute, non malitia Publio Scipioni summo viro ob easdem artes a Micipsa non penu+ria liberorum in adoptatum esse.
Caeterum {quod} plera{que} bene at{que} strennue fecisset, eo ai~m suu~ iniuriam minus tollerare.
Adherbalem do lis vitae suae insidiatu~ esse: quod vbi comperisset: sce+leri obuiam isse.
Populum romanum ne{que} recte, ne{que} pro bono si a iure ge~tium sese prohibuerit.
Postremo de omnibus rebus legatos Romam breui Ita vtri{que} grediuntur.
pages missing] Iugurtha vbi eos Aphrica discessisse rat{us} est ne{que} propter loci naturam armis expugnare Cirtham potest: vallo at{que} fossa menia circundat, turres extruit, eas{que} presidijs firmat.
Praeterea dies noctesque aut per vim, aut dolis te~tare: defe~soribus moeniu~ praemia modo: modo formidinem ostentare suos horta~do ad virtutem erigere prorsus inte~tus cuncta parare.
At vbi Adherbal intelligit omnes fortunas suas in extremo sitas: hostem infestu~: auxilij spem nullam necessaria{rum} rerum bellum trahi non posse: ex his, qui vna Cirtham profugerant, duos maxime impigros delegit: eos multa pollicendo ac miserando casum suu~ co~firmat: vti per hostium munitio~es noctu ad proximum mare, deinde Ro+mam pergerent.
Litterae Adherbalis in senatu recitate sunt, quarum sente~tia haec erat.
NOn mea culpa saepe ad vos oratum mitto patres co~scripti, sed vis Iugurthae subegit: quem tanta libido extinguendi me inuasit: vt ne{que} vos, ne{que} deos immortales in aio habeat.
Ita{que} iam quintu~ me~sem socius, et amicus populi romani armis te+neor, ne{que} Micipsa patris mei beneficia, ne{que} vestra decreta auxiliantur.
Plura de Iugurtha scribe+re dehortatur me fortuna mea: etiam ante exper+tus sum parum fidei mise+ris esse, tamen intelligo illum supra {quam} ego sum pe+tere.
Ne{que} simul amicicia~ vestram et regnum meum sperare utru~ grauius exi+stimet nemini occultu~ est.
Nam i~ initio occidit Hiempsalem fratrem meu~. Deinde patrio regno me expulit.
Que sane fuerit nr~e iniurie: nihil ad vos. Verum nunc regnum armis tenet.
Me quem vos im{per}atorem numidis posuistis clausum obsidet: legatorum verba quanti fecerit: pericula mea declarant.
Quid reliquum nisi vis vestra qua moueri possit Nam ego quidem vellem hec que scribo et illa quae antea in senatu questus sum vana forent: potius {quam} miseria mea fidem vobis faceret: sed quoniam in eo natus su~: vt Iugurthae scelerum ostentui essem.

HIs literis recitatis fuere qui exercitu~ i~ Aphricam mittendum decernerent: {quam} primum Adherbali subueni endum. interim de Iugur+tha consuleretur quonia~ legatis non paruisset. sed ab ijsdem regis fautoribus summa ope enixum est ne tale decretum fieret: ita bonum publicum (vt pleris{que} negotijs solet) priuata gratia deuictum.
Legantur tamen in Aphrica~ maiores natu nobiles amplis honoribus vsi: in quis fuit Marcus Emilius Scaurus de quo supra memorauim{us}: homo co~sularis: tum in senatu potens princeps.
Hi {quod} Iugurthae res in inuidia erat: simulet a Numidis obsecrati: triduo i~ nauem ascendere.
Deinde breui Vticam appulsi literas ad Iugurtha~ mittunt {quam} ocissime ad proui~ciam accedat: se{que} ad eum ab senatu missos. assumitur Scaurus: qui ta metsi a principio pleris{que} aex factione ei{us} corruptis acerrime rege~ impugnabat: magnitudine pecu+niae a bono honesto{que} in abstractus est.
Sed Iugurtha primu~ belli tantu~modo moram redime bat: existimans sese aliquid interim Romae aut gratia effecturum.
vero {quam} participem negocij Scau+rum accepit: i~ maximam spem adductus recuperan de pacis: statuit cu~ eis de omnibus pactionibus pre+sens agere.
Caeteru~ interea fidei causa mittitur a co~sule Sextius questor in oppidum Iugurthae Vaccam: cuius rei species erat acceptio srumenti: quod Calphurnius palam legatis imperauerat: quonia~ deditionis mora inducie agitabantur.
Igitur rex (vti constituerat) in castra perueuit ac pauca presenti locutus de inuidia facti sui at{que} vti i~ deditionem acciperetur: reliqua cu~ Bestia et secreto transegit.
Deinde postero die quasi per satyram legem sente~ tijs exquisitis in deditionem accipitur: Sed vti pro consilio im{per} atum erat: eliphante triginta pecus atque equi multi non cum paruo argenta pondere questori traduntur.
POst{quam} autem in Aphrica gestas et quomodo acte forent fama diuulgauit.
Rome {per} omnis locos et conuent{us} de facto consulis agitari: apud plebem grauis inui+dia orta est.
Patres solici ti erant an probarent ta~tum flagitium an decretum co~sulis subuertere~t: parum constabat.
At maxime eos potentia Scauri {quod} is auctor et socius Bestie ferebat a vero bono{que} impediebat.
At Caius Me~mius: de cuius libertate ingenij et odio pote~tie nobilitatis supra diximus inter dubitationem: et moras se natus in concionibus populum ad vendicandum hortari: monere populu~ romanum ne libertatem suam desererent: crudelia et superba multa facinora nobilitatis ostendere: prorsus intentus omnino plebis animum accendebat.
Sed quoniam ea te~pestate Rome Memmij facundia clara pollens que fuit decere existimaui vna~ (ex ta~ multis) orationem eius perscribere: ac potissimum eam dicam qua~ in co~cione post reditum bestie huiuscemodi verbis disseruit.
MVlta me dehortant a vobis quirites: ni si studium rei publi+cae omnia superet: opes fa+ctionis: vestra patientia: ius nullum: ac maxime {quod} innocentie plus periculi {quam} honoris est.
Nam illa~ quidem piget dicere: his annis quindecim {quam} ludibrio fueritis su perbie paucorum {quam} fed {quam}que multi perierunt ve+stri defe~sores vt nobis animus ab ignauia atque corruptus sit: qui ne nu~c quide~ obnoxij inimicis exurgitis.
Sed {quam}{quam} haec falia sunt: tamen ire potentie factionis anim{us} subegit.
Certe ego libertate~ que mihi apare~te meo tradita est experiar.
Verum frustra an ob rem facia~ in vestra manu situm est.
Neque vos hortor quod saepe vestri maiores fecere uti contra iniurias armati eatis: nihil nec secessione opus est: necesse est suomet ipsi more p~cepites eant.

Ita{que} postremo leges magestas yr~a diuina et humana oia hostibus tradita sunt.
Neque qui ea fecere aut paenitet: sed incedunt perora vestra magnifice: sacerdotia et co~sulatus: triumphos ostentantes perinde quasi ea honori non prede habeant.
At qui sunt hi qui re~publicam occupaucre? homines sceleratissimi manibus imma auatitia nocentissimi dem{que} superbissimi quibus decus pietas postremo honesta at{que} in honesta oia questui sunt.

Sed haec inter bonos amicitia: inter malos factio est. &abQUOD si tantam vos curam libertatis haberetis: {quam} illi ad dominatione~ accen si sunt: profecto: ne{que} res publica (sicuti nunc) vastaretur: et beneficia vestra penes optimos no~ au dacissimos forent.
Maiores parandi iuris et magestatis co~stituende gratia· per secessionem armati: bis Auentinu~ montem occupauere: vos pro libertate qua~ ab illis accepist{is}: no~ne su~ ma ope nitemini: at{que} eo vehe~tentius {quod} maius dedecus est parta amittere {quam} omnino no~ parauisse? aliquis: quid igit vindicandum in eos qui hosti prodidere rempu: non manu neque quod magis vobis {quam} illis accidisse indignum est· Verum questionib{us} et indicio ipsius iugurthae: qui si deditus est: profecto ius+sis vestris obediens erit.
Sin ea co~temnit: scilicet existimabitis qualis illa pax aut deditio sit: ex qua ad Iugurtham scelerum impunitas: ad paucos potentes maxime diuitie: ad rempu. damna atque dedecora peruene rint.
Nisi fore non du~ eti am vos dn~ationis eorum satietas tenet: et illa {quam} haec tempora magis placent: cum regna prouincie leges iudicia bella atque paces: postre mo diuina humana om+nia penes paucos erant.
Vos autem inuicti ab hostibus imperatores omni+um gentium satis habebatis animam retinere.
At ego tametsi virum flagitiosum existimo i~pune iniuria~ accepisse: tn~ vos hoi~bus sceleratissimis ignoscere: qm~ sunt aequo ai~o paterer ni mi~a i~ perniciem casura esset.
Nam et illis quantu~ importunitatis habent parum est impune male nisi faciundi licentia deinde eriptatur.
Et vobis eterna folicitudo remanebit: quum intelligitis aut serutendu~ esse aut per manus libertatem retinendam.
Nam fidei aut con cordie quae spes est? Dn~ari volunt: vos liberi esse: facere illi iniuriam vos prohibere: postremo socijs nostris velu ti hostibus: hostibus pro socijs vtuntur: potest ne in tam diuersis mentibus pax aut amicitia esse? Quare moneo horror{que} vos ne tantum scelus impunitum omittatis.
Non peculatus erarij factus est neque per vim socijs erepte pecume que· {quam} {quam} grauia sunt, tamen ex co suetudine iam pro habentur.
Hosti acerrimo prodita senatus authoritas: proditum imperium vestium est: domi militieque refpublica venalis suit que nisi quesita erunt: et nisi vindicatum in noxios quid erit reliquu~ nisi vt illis obedientes viuamus qui ea Na~ impune quodlibet agere: id est regem esse.
Neque vos quirites hortor vt malitis ciues vestros {quam} recte fece sed ne ignoscendo malis bonos pditum eatis.

HEc atque alia huius cemodi saepe dicendo Memmius popu+lo {per}suadet vt Lucius Cas+sius qui tum pretor erat ad Iugurtham mitteret eum{que} interposita fide pu+blica Roma~ duceret: quo facili{us} idicio regis et reliquorum quos pe+cunie capte arcesseba~t de+licta
DVm haec Rome geru~+tur: qui in Numidia relicti a Bestia exer+citui pre erant: sequuti morem imperatoris sui plurima flagitiosissima facinora. fuere qui auro corrupti elephantos Iugurthae traderent.
AT Cassius perlata rogatione a Caro Memmio ac percul sa omni nobilitate ad Iu+gurtham proficiscitur: ei que timido et ex conscientia diffidenti rebus suis persuadet (quoniam se populo romano dedisset) ne vim {quam} misericordiam mallet.
Priuatim praeterea fidem suam interponit qua~ minoris {quam} publicam ducebat.
Iugurtha co~tra decus re+gium cultu {quam} maxime mi+serabili cum Canto Romam venit.
Ac tametsi in ipso magra vis animi erat confirmato ab omnibus quorum potentia aut scelere cu~cta ea gesserat: quae supra tamen Bebium tribunum plebis magna mercede parat cuius impudentia contra ius et iniurias om+nes munitus foret.
Caius Memmius aduocata concione ({quam}{quam} regi infesta plebs erat: et pars in vincula duci iuberet: pars vero nisocios sceleris aperiret: more maiorum de hoste supplicium sumi dignitati magis {quam} ire consulens: sedare motus et animos eoru~ mollire postremo confirmare fidem publicam per sese inuiolatam fore.
Rome Numidiae{que} facinora eius memorat scelera in patre~ fratresque oste~dit: et quibus iuuantibus quibusque ministris ea egerit: {quam} {quam} intel+ligit populus Romanus tamen se velle manifeste magis ex illo habere: si verum aperiat: in fide et cleme~tia populi romani magnam spem illi sitam.
Sin reticeat: non saluti fore: sese et suas opes corrupturum.
Deinde vbi Me~mi{us} dice~di finem fecit et Iugurtha est respondere Caius Bebius (que~ pecunia corruptum supra diximus) regem tacere iubet: ac tametsi multitudo quae in co~cione aderat vehementer accensa terrebat eu~ clamore vultuque: sepe impetu: at{que} alijs omnibus quae ira fieri Vicit tn~ Bebij impudentia.
Iugurthae Bestie{que} et caeteris quos illa questio ex agitabat ai~ augescunt.
ERat ea te~pestate Romae Numida quidam nomine Massiua fili{us} Galussae: nepos Massinissae: qui (quia in dissensione regum Iugurthae aduersus fuerat) dedita Cirtha et Adherbale interfecto profugus ex Aphrica abierat.
Huic Spurius Albinus qui proximo anno post bestia~ cum quinto Minutio Ruffo co~sulatu~ gerebat: {per}suadet: quoniam stirpe Massinissae sit Iugurtham ob scelera in uidia cu~ metu vrgeat: regnum Numidiae a senatu petat. auidus consul belli gerundi moueri {quam} sene scere omnia malebat.
Que post{quam} Massiua agitare cepit: ne{que} Iugurthae in amicis satis p~sidij est (quia corum aliu~ conscientia: alium mala fama et timor impediebat) Bomilchari proxi~o ac maxime fido sibi impe+rat vt precio (sicuti multa confecerat) sidiatores Massiue paret: ac maxime occulte: sinid paru~ procedat: quouis modo Numidam interficiat.
Bomilchar mature regis mandata exequitur {per} ho+mines talis negocij artifices: itinera egreus{que} eius postremo loca at{que} tempora explorat.
Igit vnus ex eo numero qui ad cedem parati erant: paulo inco~ ultius Massiua~ aggreditur: illu~que obtrun+cat.
Sed ipse multis horta~ribus, et in primis Albino consule in dicium profitetur.
Fit re+us magis ex aequo et bono {quam} ex iure gentium Bomilchar comes eius qui Roma~ fide pu. venerat.
At Iugurtha manifestus tanti sceleris non prius omisit contra verum niti {quam} anima duertit supra gratiam ac pecuniam suam inuidiam
Igitur {quam}{quam} in priori actio ne ex amicis quinquagin ta vades dederat: regno magis {quam} vadibus consulens: in Numidiam dimittit Bomilchar e~veritus ne reliquos popula+res metus inuaderet parendi sibi: si de illo supplicium sumptum foret.
Et ipse paucis diebus eo profectus est: iusius a senatu Italia discedere.
Sed post{quam} Roma egressus est fertur saepe tacitus respiciens postremo dixisse vrbem venalem et mature perituram: si emptore~ inuenerit.
INterim Albinus reno+uato bello co~meatum stipendiu~ aliaque quae militibus vsui forent: ma+turat in Aphrica~ portare ac statim ipse profectus est vti ante comitia qd tempus haud longe aberat) armis aut deditione~ aut quouis modo bellum conficeret.
At contra Iugurtha trahere omnia: et alias dein+de alias causas more facere: polliceri deditione~ ac deinde metum simula+re: cedere instanti: et pau+lo post (ne sui diffidere~t) instare: ita belli modo: modo pacis consulem ludificare.
At fuere qui tum Albinu~ haud ignarum co~silij regis existimarent.
Neque ex tanta propera~+tia: tam facile tractu~ bellum secordia magis {quam} do+lo crederent.
Sed post{quam} dilapso tempore comitiorum dies Albin{us}· Aulo fratre in castris pro p~tore relicto Ro+ma~ distescit.
Publius Lucullus: Lucius Annius tri+buni plebis resistentibus collegis co~tinuare magistratum nitebantur.
Ea mora in spem adductus Aulus (quem pro pretore in castris relictu~ supra diximus) aut conficiendi belli gratia: aut terrore exercit{us} ab rege pecunie capiunde milites mense Ianuario ex taber naculis in expeditionem euocat: magnis{que} itineri+bus hyeme aspera peruenit ad oppidu~ Suthul vbi regis thesauri erant.
Quod {quam}{quam} et seuitia temporis et oportunitate loci neque capi neque obsi+deri poterat (nam circa murum situm in prerupti montis extremo planicies limosa hyemalibus aquis paludem fecerat) tn~ aut similandi gratia quo regi formidine~ adderet: aut cupidine cecus opidi potiundi: vineas agere: aggerem aliaque quae incepto vsui forent preparare.
At Iugurtha cognita vanitate atque im{per}itia legati subdole eius augere ame~tia~ missitare supplicantes legatos: Ipse quasi vitabundus {per} saltuosa loca et exercitu~ ductare.
Denique Aulum spe pactio~is pepulit: vti Suthule relicto in abditas regi+ones sese veluti rede~tem insequeretur.
Interea Iugurtha per ho+mines callidos die noctu que exercitum tentabat: centuriones duces{que} turmarum partim vti transfugere~t corrumpere· alij signo dato vti locum desererent.
Quae post{quam} ex sente~tia in+struxit intempesta nocte cum multitudine Numidarum Auli castra circu~uenit.
Milites Romani perculsnsolito metu arma alij sese abdere: pars territos confirmare: trepidare omnibus locis vis magna hostium: nocte atque nubibus obscutatum: periculum anceps.
Sed ex eo numero quos paulo ante corruptos diximus cohors vna ligurum cum duabus turmis Tracum et paucis gregarijs militibus transiere ad regem: et Ce~turio pri mipili tertie legionis {per}munitione~ quam vti defenderet acceperat) locu~ hostibus intro dedit.
Ex feda fuga: plerique abiectis armis proximu~ collem occupauere. nox atque preda castroru~ hostes quominus victoria vterentur remorata su~t. Deide postero die Iugurtha cu~ Aulo in colloquio verba facit: tametsi ipsu~ cum exercitu fame ferroque clausum tenet: tame~ dicit se memorem humanarum rerum si secum fedus faceret: incolumes omnes sub preterea vti decem diebus Numidia decederent.
Quae {quam} {quam} grauia et flagitij plena erant: tame~ que a mortis metu nutabant sicuti regi libuerat conuenit.
SEd vbi ea Romae com+perta sunt: metus at{que} meror ciuitatem inuasere.
pro gloria imperi: pars insoli ti bellicarum rerum time re libertati.
Aulo omnes i~ festi: ac maxime qui bello sepe fuerant{que} armatus de decore potius{que} manu salutem quesiuerat.
Obea consul Albinus ex delicto fratris inuidiam ac deinde periculum timens senatum de foedere consulebat: tamen exercitur interim supplemen+tum scribere.
Senatus (vti par fuerat) suo atque populi imussu nullum potuisse fedus fieri.
Consul impeditus a tribuno plebis ne quas parauerat copias secu~ portaret: paucis diebus in Aphricam proficiscitur.
Post{quam} eo ventum est ({quam} {quam} persequi Iugurtham: et moderi fraterne inuidie animus ardebat) cognitis militib{us} quos preter sugam soluto imperio lice~tia atque lasciuia corruperat ex copia reru~ sta sibi nihil agendum.
Interi~ Romae Caius Ma~lius limitanus rogationem ad populum promulgat vti quereretur in eos quoru~ co~silio senat{us} decreta neglexisse: et qui elephantos {per}fugas: quique ob eo aut in legationibus aut imperijs pecunias
Item qui de pace aut bello cum hostibus pactiones fecissent.
Huic rogationi partim conscij sibi: alij ex partium inuidia pericula metuentes: quoniam aparte resistere non qui~ illa et alia ralia placere sibi faterentur occul+te {per} amicos ac maxime {per} homines nominis et socios Italicos i~pedimenta parabant.
Sed plebs (i~credibile memoratu est) {quam}tum intenta fuerit {quam}taque rogatio nem magis odio nobilitatis (cui illa mala parabantur) {quam} cura
Igitur caeteris {per}cul+sis metu Marcus Scaurquem legatum Bestie supra memorauimus inter leticiam plebis et suoru~ fuga~ trepida etiam tunc ciuitate quum ex rogatio~e tres quesitores rogare~tur: effecerat vti ipse in eo munero crearetur.
Sed questione exercitata aspere viole~terque ex rumore et libidine plebis: vt saepe nobilitatem: sic ea tempestate plebem ex secundis rebus insole~tia ceperat.
CEterum mos partiu~ popularium: et tus factionum: ac de inde omnium malarum artium paucis ante annis Romae ortus est otio atque habundantia earu~ rerumque prima mortas ducunt.
Nam ante Carthaginem deletam populus et sena+tus roman{us} placide modesteque inter se rempublicam tractabant.
Sed vbi illa formido a mentibus discessit: scilicet ea que res secunde amant: lasciuia atque su{per}bia incessere.
Ita (quod in aduersis rebus optaue+rant) ocium post{quam} adepti sunt acerbius asperius que tulere.
Nam cepere nobilitas di+gnitate~ in dn~atione~: populus libertate~ in libidinem vertere: sibi quis{que} ducere trahere
Ita omi~a in duas partes abstracta sunt. respublica quae media fuerat dilacerata est.
Paucorum arbitrio belli domique respublica agitabatur: penes eosde~ aerarium prouincie magi+stratus glorie triumphi que erant.
Interea pare~tes aut parui liberi militu~ (vti quis que potentiori confinis erat) sedibus pelleba~tur.
Ita cum potentia auaritia sine modo modestra{que} inuadere polluere et vastare omnia: nihil pe~si ne que sancti habere quo ad semetipsa~ precipitauit.
Na~ post{quam} Tiberius et Gracchus (quoru~ matores in punico bello at{que} alijs multum addidera~t) vendicare ple+bem in libertate~: et paucorum scelera patefacere cepere nobilitas noxi a atque eo {per}culsa modo {per} socios ac nome~ latinu~ interdum per equites romanos (quos spes societatis a plebe dimouerat) Gracchorum actionibus obuia~ erat: et primo Tiberiu~· deinde paucos post annos ingredientem eadem tribunum al terum in educendis colonijs cu~ Marcho Fuluto Flacco ferro necauerat.
Sed bono vinci facius est {quam} malo more iniuria~ vincere.
Igiturea victoria nobilitas ex libidine sua vsa multos mortalis ferro aut fuga extinxit: plus{que} in reliquum sibi timoris {quam} potentie addidit.
Quae res plerumque magnas ciuitates pessundedit du~ alteri alteros vincere quouis modo et victos acerbius vlcisci volunt.
Sed de studijs partium oi~bus que ciuitatis morib{us} si singulatim aut pro magnitudine parem disserere: tp~s {quam} res maturius me desereret.
POst Auli fedus exercitus que nostri fuga~ fedam Quintus Metellus et Marcus Sillanus consules designati prouintias inter se parti uerant.
Metello{que} Numidia obuenerat acri viro: et {quam}{quam} aduerso populi partibus fama tamen aequabili et inuiolata.
Is vbi primum magistratu~ ingressus est: alia omnia sibi cum collega coi~a ratus ad bellum (quod gesturus erat) ai~m inte~dit.
Igitur diffide~s veteri ex ercitui: milites eligere scribere presidia vndi{que} accersere tela equos et caetera instrume~ta militie parare: ad hoc co~meatum affatim: denique omnia quae in bello vario et multarum reru~ egenti vsui esse solent.
Caeterum ad ea patranda senatus authoritate socij nome~que latinu~ et reges.
Itaque ex sententia oms rebus paratis compositisque in Numidiam proficiscitur magna spe+ciuiu~: tum propter artis tu~ maxime {quod} aduersum diuitias inuictu~ animum gerebat: et auaritia magistratuum ante id te~pus in Numidia nostre opes contuse: hostiu~que aucte erant.
Sed vbi in Aphricam venit exercitus ei traditur a Spurio Albino proco~sule iners imbecillis ne{que} periculi neque laboris patiens: lingua {quam} manu prom+ptior: predator ex socijs et ipse preda hostium sine imperio modestia ha+bitus.
Ita imperatori nouo plus malis maioribus solicitudinis {quam} ex co+pia militu~ auxilij aut bo+nae spei accedebat.
Statu+it tamen Metellus ({quam}{quam} et estiuorum tp~s comitioru~ mora imminuerat: et expectatione euentus ciuium ai~os intentos putabati non prius bellum attingere: {quam} maioru~ milites laborare coegisset.
Nam Albinus Auli fratris exercitus{que} clade perculsus, post{quam} decreuerat non egredi prouintia, {quam}tum te~poris aesti+uoru~ in imperio fuit: plerumque milites in statutis castris habebat: nisi cum aut pabuli egess locum mutare sub egerat.
Sed neque more vigilie duceban+tur: vti cui{que} libebat, ab signis aberat.
Lixae {per}mix+ti cum equitibus die noctuque vagabantur: palantes vastare: villas expugnare: pecoris et mancipiorum predas cer+tantes agere: eaque mutare cu~ marcatorib{us} pro+vino aduecticio et alijs talibus.
Postremo quaecun{que} dici aut fingi queunt ignauie luxurie{que} probra in illo exercitu cuncta fuere: et alia amplius.
Sed in ea difficultate Metellu~ non minus {quam} in rebus hostilibus magnum et sapiente~ virum fuisse co~perio: tan+ta tempera~tia inter ambitionem seuitiam{que} moderatu~.
Na~{que} edicto primo adiumenta ignauiae dicit sustulisse ne quis{quam} i~ castris panem aut quem· aliumcibum coctum venderet: ne lixe sequere~tur exercitum: ne miles gregarius in neue in agmine seruu~ aut iumen tum haberet.
Praeterea transuer+sis itinerib{us} quotidie castra mouere: vallo ac fossa munire: vigilias crebras ponere: et eas ipse cum legatis circu~ire.
Item i~ agmine inprimis modo: modo i~ postremis: saepe in medio adesse: ne quispiam ordine vt cum signis freque~tes incederent: miles cibum et arma portaret.
Ita prohibe~do a delictis magis {quam} vindicando exer+citum breui co~firmauit.
INterea Iugurtha vbi ea quae Metellus agebat ex nu~cijs accepit si mulde innoce~tia ei{us} certior Rome fact{us} diffidere suis rebus: ac tum deinum veram deditionem facerere conatus est.
Qui tantu~modo ipsi liberis que vita~ petere~t: alia omnia dederent populo Romano.
Sed Metello ta~ antea experime~tis cognitum erat genus numidarum infidum mobili: nouaru rerum auidum esse.
Itaque legatos alium ab alio diuersos aggreditur: ac pau satim tentando post{quam} oportunos sibi cognouit: multa pollicendo persua det vt Iugurtham maxi~e viuum: sin id parum procedat: necatum sibi Caetera palam quae ex vo+luntate forent nunciari regi iubet.
Deinde paucis diebus in tento atque infesto exercitu in Numidiam proce+dit.
Vbi contra belli faciem tuguria plena hominum: pecora cultores{que} in agris erant: ex oppidis et mapalibus profecti regis obuiam procedebant: parati frumentum dare: co~meatum portare.
Neque Metellus idcirco+min{us} sed pariter ac si hostes adessent: munito agmine i~cedere: late explorare: oi~a illa deditionis oste~tui esse credere: insidijs locum tentare.
Ita{que} cu~ expeditis cohor+tibus: Item funditoru~ et sagittarioru~ delecta manu apud primos erat.
In vtrum que lat{us} auxiliarios equites tribu+nis legionu~ et prefectis cohortum dispertiuerat: vt cu~ his velites {per}mixti quocu~que accederent: equitat{us} hostiu~ {pro}pulsare~t.
Nam in Iugurtha ta~tus dolus tantaque peritia locorum et militie erat: vt an presens pacem an bellum gerens {per}nitrosior esset: in incerto haberetur.
Erat haud lo~ge ab eo itinere quo Metellus {per}gebat opidu~ Numidarum noi~e Vacca forum rerum venaliu~ toti{us} regnitet maxime celebra+tu~: vbi et incolere: et mer+cari res consueuera~t Italici generis multi mortales.
Huic consul simul te~+tandi gra et capiundi (si paterent oportunitates loci) presidium imposuit.
Praeterea im{per}auit frume~ tu~ et alia quae bello vsui forent co~portare: ratus (id quod res monebat) fre+que~tiam negociatoru~ et co~meatu~ etia~ paratis rebus munimento fore.
Inter haec negotia Iugurtha impensius modo legatos supplices mittere: pacem rogare: preter suam liberorumque vitam Metello omnia dedere.
Quos ite~ (vt priores) co~sul illectos dimittebat ad proditionem: regi pacem (quam postulabat) neque abnuere: neque et inter eas moras promissa legatoru~ ex pectare.
Iugurtha vbi Metelli dicta cum factis composuit: ac se suis artibus tentari ai~aduertit (Quippe cui verbis nunciaba+tur: caeterum rebellum a spertimu~ erat: Vrbs maxima alienata: Ager hostibus cognitus animi popularium tenta+ti) coactus rerum necessitudine statuit armis
IGitur explorato itinere hostrum in spem victoriae adductus ex opportunitate loci: {quam} maximas copias potest oim ge+neru~ parat: ac per tramites occultos exercitum Metelli anteuenit.
Erat in ea Numidie parte: qua~ Adherbal in diuisione possederat: flumen oriens a meridie nomine Muthul a quo mons aberat ferme milia pauu~ viginti tractu vastus a natura et humano cultu alienat{us}: sed ex eo medio quasi collis oriebat in immensum vestitus oleastro ac myrthetis alijs{que} arboru~ generibus que humo arida at{que} gignuntur.
Media autem planicies deserta erat penuria aque p~ter flumini propinqua loca: ea consita arbustis pecore atque cultoribus frequentabantur.
Igitur in eo colle transuerso itinere portectum docuim{us}:) Iugurtha extenuata acie suoru~ co~sedit: elephantis et parti copiaru~ pedestriu~ Bomilcharem prefecit: eum edocet quae ageret: ipse propior montem cum om+ni equitatu atque pediti+bus delectis suos collocat.
Deinde singulas turmas et manipulos monet atque vti memores pristine victorie: sese re umque ab Romano ru~ defendant.
Quae ab im{per}atore decue+rint omnia· suis prouisa locum superiorem: vti prude~tes cum imperitis nec pauciores cum pluribus aut rudes cum bello melioribus manum consererent: proinde parti intenti{que} essent siguo dato Romanos inuadere.
aut omnis labores et victorias confir+maturu~: aut maximarum erumnarum initiu~ fore.
Adhoc viritim: vti que~{que} ob militare facinus pecunia: aut honore extulerat co~mone facere beneficij: et eum ipsum alijs ostentare.
Postremo pro cuiusque i~ genio pollicendo: minitando: ostentando: alium alio modo excitare.
Cum interim Metellus ignarus hostium monte degrediens cum exercitu conspicitur: primo dubius quidnam insolita facies ostenderet (Nam inter virgulta equi Numideque confederant ne{que} plane occultati humilitate arborum: et tamen incertum quidnam esset tum natura loci: tum dolo: ipsi atque militaria signa obscurati) Deinde bui cognitis insidijs paulisper agme~ co~stituit Ibi co~mutatis ordinibus i~ dextro latere quod pro mum hostib{us} erat: triplicibus subsidijs instruxit: inter manipulos funditores et sagitta rios dispertit. equitatu~ omnem in cornibus locat: ac pauca pro te~pore milites hortatus: aciem sicuti instruxerat: tra~suer+sis principijs in planum
Sed vbi Numidas quictos neque digressos colle animaduertit: ex anni te~pore veritus et inopia aquae ne siti conficeretur exercitus: Rutiliu~ legatum cu~ expeditis cohortibus et parte equitu~ pre misit ad flumen: vti locu~ castris ante caperet: existimans crebro hostes impetu et transuersis prelijs iteru~ remoraturos: et (quoniam armis diffidere~t) lassitudinem et sitim militum te~taturos.
Deinde ipse pro re atque loco sicuti monte descenderat paulatim proce+dere Marium post principia habere: ipse cum equi tibijs sinistrae alae esse qui in agmine princeps facti erant.
AT Iugurtha vbi ex tremu~ agmen Metelli primos suos praetergressum videt: prae sidio quasi duu~ miliu~ peditum montem occupat: quo Metellus descenderat: ne forte cedentibus aduersarijs receptui: ac post munimento foret.
Numidae alij postremos caedere pars a sinistra ac dextra tentare: infe~si adesse: instare atque omnibus locis romanorum ordines conturbare.
Quorum etiam qui firmioribus animis obuij hostib{us} fuerant· ludificati incerto praelio: ipsi modo eminus sauciaba~tur: ne{que} con+tra feriendi aut manum copia erat.
Ante iam docti ab Iugur+tha equites: vbi romano ru~ turmae insequi coeperant non confertim ne{que} in vnum se recipiebant: sed alius alio {quam} maxime diuersi.
Ita numero priores si a persequendo hostes deterrere nequiuera~t: disiectos a tergo aut a lateribus circunueniebant.
Sin oportunior fugae collis quam ca~pi fuerat: Ea vero loca consueti numidarum equi facile i~ter virguita euadere: Nostros asperitas et insolentia loci retinebat.
Caeterum facies toti{us} varia: incerta: feda atque miserabilis: diuersi a suis pars re: alij insequi: ne{que} signa ne{que} ordines obseruare: Vbi quem{que} periculu~ ceperat: ibi resistere ac propulsare.
Arma tela equi viri hostes atque ciues {per}mixti: nihil co~silio aut imperio sors omnia regere· Itaque multum diei processerat: cu~ etiam tu~ euen tus in incerto erat.
Denique omnib{us} labore et estu languidis Metellus vbi videt Numidas minus instare: paulatim milites in vnum co~ducit: ordines restituit: et cohortes legionarias quatuor aduersus pedites ho+stium collocat.
Eorum magna pars locis superioribus sessa consederat simul orare: horta+ri milites ne deficerent· Neu patere~tur fugientes vincere: neque illis castra esse: ne que munimentum vllum quo cedentes tenderent: in armis omnia sita.
Sed nec Iugurtha quide~ interea quietus erat: cir+cu~ire hortari renouare prelium: et ipse cum delectis oi~a subuenire suis: hostibus instare dubijs: quos firmos cognouerat: eminus pugnando retinere.
Eo modo inter se duo im+peratores su~mi viri certabant: ipsi pares: caeterum opibus disparibus.
Deinde romani vbi intel+ligunt neque sibi profugium esse: neque ab hoste copiam pugnandi fieri: etiam diei vesper erat: aduerso colle (sicuti praeceptum fuerat) euadunt.
INterea bomilchar que~ eliphantis et parti pedestrium prefectum a Iugurtha supra di+ximus: vbi eum Rutilius pretergressus est: paulatim suos in equum locum deducit: ac dum legatus ad flumen quo premissus erat festina~s pergit (vti res aciem instruxit: neque remittit explorare quid vbique hostis ageret.
Postquam Rutilium consedisie et ai~o vacuu~ esse accepit: simulque Iugurthae ex prelio clamorem augeri: veritus ne legatus cognita re labora~+tibus suis auxilio foret: aciem, quam diffidens vir+tuti militum arcte statuerat, quo hostium itineri officeret, latius porrigit.
Post vbi aequabilem manere: acies moueba+tur: magis magis que appropinquare videbant co+gnita re properantes arma capiu~t: ac pro castris (sicuti imperatur) consistunt.
Numidae tantu~modo su~t remorati du~ in eliphantis auxilium puta~t: post{quam} eos impeditos ramis arborum atque ita circu~ueniri vident: fugam faciunt: ac plerique abiectis armis collis aut noctis (quae iam aderat) auxilio i~tegri abeunt. elephanti quatuor capti: reliqui oe~s numero quadraginta interfecti sunt.
At romani {quam} {quam} itinere at+que opere castroru~ et praelio lassique erant: tn~{que} Metellus amplius opinione morabatur instructi intentique obuiam procedunt.
Ac primo obscura nocte post{quam} haud procul inter se erant strepitu velut ho+stes aduentare: alteri apud alteros formidinem et tumulum facere: et pene imprudentia admissum facinus miserabile foret: ni vtrimque proemissi equites rem explorauissent.
Milites alius alium laeti appeliant: acta edocent: atque audiunt: sua quisque fortia facta ad celum Quippe humane res ita se habent: in victoria etiam ignauis gloriari licet: aduerse res etiam detractant bonos.
Metellus inijsde~ castris quatriduo moratus: saucios cum cura reficit: me ritos in prelijs more militiae donat: vniuersos in contione laudat: atque a+git gratias: hortatur ad caetera quae leuia sunt parem animu~ gerant: Pro victoria satis ia~ pugnatum: reliquos labores praedae fore.
Tum interim tra~sfugant et alios oportunos vbi Iugurtha gentium: aut quid ageret: cum ne esser: an exercitum ha+beret: vt sese victus gereret: exploratum misit.
At ille sese in loca saltuosa et munita natura receperat: ibique cogebat exercitum numero homi+num ampliorem: sed i~firmumque: agri ac pecoris magis {quam} belli cultorem.
Id ea gratia eueniebat: {quod} praeter regios equites omniu~ Numidaru~ ex fuga regem sequebat
Quo animus fert eo descedunt: neque id flatium militiae ducit ita se mores habent.
IGitur Metellus vbi vi+det regis etia~ tum animum ferocem esse bellum renouari: quod nisi ex illius libidine no~ posset: Praeterea iniquum certa men sibi cu~ hostibus: minore detrimento illos vi~+ci {quam} vincere: statuit non praelijs neque in sed alio modo esse gerendum.
Itaque in loca Numidiae opulentissima pergit: agros vastat: castella multa et oppida temere munita aut sine presidio capit: incenditque.
Ea formidine multi mortales romanis dediti: obsides frume~tu~ et alia que rore~t: affatim prebita sunt: vbicu~{que} res postulabat presidiu~ impositu~.
Que negotia multo magis {quam} praeliu~ male pugnatum ab suis regem
Quippe cui spes oi~s i~ fuga sita erat: cogebatur: et qui sua loca defendere nequiuerat: in a lienis gerere: tamen ex quod opti+mum videbatur consiliu~ capit: exercitum plerumque in ijsdem locis o{per}iri iubet.
Ipse cum delectis equitibus Metellum sequitur auijsque itineribus ignoratus roma nos palantes repente aggreditur.
Numidae prius{quam} subueniretur (sicuti ii erant) in proximos colles discedunt.
INterim Rome gaudiu~ ortum est cogni+tis Metelli rebus vt se exercitumque more maiorum gereret. {quam} {quam} inaduerso loco tn~ victor fuisse virtute hostiu~ agro potiretur.
Iugurtham magnificum ex Auli secordia {quod} spem salutis insolitudine aut fuga coegessit habere.
Itaque senatus ob ea feliciter acta dijs immorta libus supplicia decernere.
Ciuitas a~rea trepida et solicita de belli euentu laeta agere.
Igitur eo intentior Metellus ad victoriam niti omnibus modis: festinare: cauere: tn~ necubi hosti oportunus fieret.
Meminisse post gloriam inuidiam sequi: ita quo clarior eo magis anxius erat: neque post insidias Iugurthae effuso exercitu praedari.
Sed vbi frumento aut pa+bulo opus erat: cohortes cum omni equitatu praesidium agebant.
Exercitus parte~ ipse: reliquos Marius ducebat: sed igne magis {quam} praeda a+ger vastabatur.
Vbi opus erat: cuncti aderant: caeteru~ quo atque formido latius creeret: diuisi agebant.
Eo te~pore Iugurtha per colles sequi: tp~s aut locum pugnae quaerere: qua venturum hostem audierat pabulum aut aquaru~ fontes (quorum penuria erat) corrumpere. modo se Metello: i~terdu~ Mario ostendere: postremo in agmine te~tare: statim in colles regredi.
Rursus alijs post alijs mi+nitari: neque prelium facere: neque ocium hostem ab incepto retinere.
ROmanus sperator vbi se dolis fatigari neque ab hoste copiam fieri: vrbem magnam et i~ ea parte qua sita erat artem regni nomine Zama~ statuit oppugnare: ratus (id quod negotium postu labat) Iugurtham laborantib{us} suis auxilio venruru~: ibi que preliu~ fore.
At ille que parabantur a perfugis magnis itineribus Metellum oppidanos hortatus moe nia defenda~t: addis au+xilio perfugis quod genus ex copijs regis (quia fallere nequibat) fortissimum erat.
Ita co~positis rebus in loca {quam} maxime occulta descendit: ac post paulo cognoscit ex itinere Marium cu~ paucis cohortibus Sicca~ mis+su~ quod oppidum primu~ omnium post malam pugnam ab rege defecerat. cum delectis pergit noctu: et egredien tibus Romanis in porta pugnam facit.
Simul magna voce Siccenses hortatur vti cohortes a tergo circumueniant: fortunam illis praeclari facinoris casu~ dare: si id fecerint: postea sese in regno: illos in libertate sine metu aetate~ acturos.
At ni Marius signa inferre euadere oppido propetauisset: profecto cuncti (aut magna pars) Siccensium fidem mutanissent.
Sed milites Iugurthini paulisper a rege sustenta+ti post{quam} maiore hostes vrge~t paucis amissis pro+fugi discedunt.
Id oppidum in campo situm magis opere {quam} natu+ra munitum erat· nullius rei idoneae egens: armis viris que opulentum.
Igitur Metellus pro tem+pore atque loco paratis rebus cuncta menia exercitu circu~uenit.
Denique signo dato vndi{que} simul clamor ingens oritur: neque ea res Numidas terret: infensi intenti{que} sine tumultu manent: praelium incipitur.
Romani pro i~genio quis que: pars eminus glande aut lapidibus pugnare: alij inuadere: ac muruni suffodere modo scalis ag+gredi: cupere praeliu~ manibus facere.
Co~tra ea oppidani in pro ximos saxa voluere: sudes pila praeterea pice et sulphure tedam mixtam ardenti mittere.
Sed nec illos qui procul manserant timor animi satis munierat.
DVm apud zammam sic certatur: Iugurtha ex inprouiso ca+stra hostium cum magna manu inuadit (remissis qui in praesidio erant) et (omnia magis{quam} prelium expectantibus) portam it rumpit.
At nostri repentino motu perculsi: sibi quisque pro moribus consulunt: fugere: alij arma magna pars vulnerati aut occisi sunt.
Caeterum ex omni multi+tudine non amplius qua draginta memores nomi+nis romani: grege facto locum coepere paulo {quam} alij editiorem ne que inde maxima depelli quine runt: Sed tela eminus missa re+mittere: pauci in plurib{us} frustrari.
Sin Numidae propius ac+cessissent: ibi vero virtutem ostendere: et eos maxima vicedere: fundereatque fugare.
Deinde conuerso equo a+nimaduertit fugam ad se+versum fieri: quae res indicabat populares esse.
Igitur equitatum omne~ ad castra propere misit· ac statim Caium Marium cum cohortibus socioru~ eumque lachrimans per amicitia~· perque rem publicam obsecrat: ne quam contumelia~ remanete in exercitu victore: neue ho+stes inultos abire sinat.
At Iugurtha munimento castrorum impeditus cum alij super vallu~ praecipitarentur: alij in angustijs ipsi sibi properantes officerent: multis amissis in loca munita sese recipit.
Metellus infecto negocio post{quam} nox aderat i~ castra cum exercitu reuertitur.
Igitur postero die prius{quam} ad oppugnandum egrederetur: equitatum omne~ in ea parte qua regis adue~tus erat: pro cass agitare portas et proxima loca tribunis dispertit: deinde ip+se pergit ad oppidum atque vti superiore die mu+ru~ aggreditur.
Interim Iugurtha ex occulto repente nostros inuadit: et qui in proximo locati erant paulis{per} territi {per}tur bantur tamen reliqui cito subueniunt.
Neque diutius Numidae resistere quiuissent: ni pedites cum equitibus permixti magnam cladem in congressu facerent: quib{us} illi non (vti inequestri fieri praelio solet) sequi: deinde vero cedere: sed aduersis equis co~currere: implicare: ac {per}turbare aciem.
Vbi quis legat{us} aut tribunus ibi alius spe~ in alio {quam} in se habere.
Pariter oppid ani agere oppugnare: aut parate omnibus locis: auidius al+teri alteros sauciare qua~ semet tegere.
Clamor {per}mixtus hortatione: leticia gemitu: ite~ strepitus armoru~ ad caelum ferri: tela vtrinque volare.
Sed illi, qui menia defensaba~t: vbi hostes paululum modo pugnam remiserant: praelium equestre prospectabant.
Eos (vt quae{que} res lugurthae erant) letos modo: pauidos modo aiaduerteres: ac sicuti audiri a suis aut cerni possent: admonere alij: hortari alij aut manu significare: aut niti corporib{us}: et huc et illuc quasi vitabundi: aut iacie~tes tela agitare.
Quod vbi Mario cognitum erat (na~ is in ea parte curabat) co~sulto leuius agere: ac diffidentiam rei simulare: pati numidas sine tumultu praeu~ regis visere.
Ita illis studio suoru~ astrictis repente magna vi+murum aggreditur: et ia~ scalis aggre milites peope summa ceperant: cum oppidani co~curru~t: lapides ignem alia praeterea tela ingerunt.
Nostri primo resistere de inde vbi vne ac altere sea+lae i~minutae sunt: qui su{per}stiterant afflicti sunt.
Caeteri quoquo modo potuere: pauci integri: magna pars confecti vulneribus abeu~t Dei~de vtrinque nox diremit.
MEtellus vbi videt frustra inceptu~: neque oppidum capi: neque Iugurtham niti+nisi ex insidijs aut suo loco pugnam facere: etiam estatem esse ab Zamma discessit: et in hijs quae ad se de iccerant: satis{que} munite aut menibus erant: praesidia imponit.
Ceterum exercitum in {pro}uintia quae proxima est Numidae hyemandi gratia collocat.
Sed quoniam armis bellum parum procedebat: insidias regi per amicos te~dere: et persidia pro armis vti parat.
Igitur Bomilcharem Romae cum Iugurtha fuerat et inde vadibus datis clam iu+diciu~ fugerat: {quod} ei {per} maxima~ amicitia~ proxi~a co+pia fallendi erat: multis policitatio~ibus aggredit ac primo efficit vti ad se coloque~di gratia occulte veniat: deinde fide data si Iugurtham aut necatum sibi fore vt illi senatus impunitatem et sua oi~a co~cederet: facile Numidae {per}suadet: tu~ ingenio rufido tu~ metuenti ne si pax cu~ romanis fieret: ipse {per} co~+ditiones ad supplicium traderetur Is vbi primum opportunum fuit Iugurtham an+xium ac miserantem for+tunas suas accedit.
Monet at{que} lachrimans obtestatur vti aliquando sibi liberis{que} et ge~ti optime merite prouideat: oi~bus praelijs sese victos: agru~ vastatu~ multos mortalis captos aut accisos: regni co~minutas esse: satis sepe ia~ virtutem militu~ et fortunam tentatam: caueat ne illo cuncta~te Nu+midae sibi consulant.
His at{que} alijs talibus ad deditionem regis animu~ impellit: mittuntur ad i~peratorem legati: qui Iu+gurtham imperata factu+rum dicerent: ac sine vlla pactione sese regnumque suum in illius fidem tradere.
Metellus cunctos senatorij ordinis exhibernis propere accersi eo+rum atque aliorum quos idoneos ducebat: consilium habet.
Ita more maiorum co~silij decreto {per} legatos Iugurthae imperat argenti pondo ducentamilia ele+phantos omnes equoru~ et armorum aliqua~tulu~.
Quae post{quam} sine mora facta su~t: iubet omnes vinctos adduci.
Pauci quum primu~ deditio cepit: ad regem Bocchum i~ mauritania~ abierant.
Igitur Iugurtha vbi armis virisque et pecunia spoliatus est: cum ipse ad imperandum Tisi diu~ vocaretur rursus cepit flectere ai~m: et ex mala conscientia digna timere.
Denique multis diebus {per} dubitationem consumptis: quum modo taedio rerum aduersarum oi~a bello potiora duceret: inter+dum secu~ ipse reputaret {quam} grauis casus inseruitium ex regno foret multis magnisque praesidijs ne quic{quam} perditis de inte+gro bellum sumit.
PEr idem tempus Vti+ce sorte Caro Mario per hostias dija supplicanti magna atque mirabilia porte~di haruspex dixerat.
Proinde quae animo agitabat fret{us} dijs ageret. {quam} sepissime fortunam ex {per}iretur: et omnia prospere euentura.
At illum iam antea consulatus inge~s cupido exagitabat: ad quem capie~ dum preter vetustare~ familie oi~a abunde erant: industria probitas militie magna scientia animus belli ingens domi modicus: libidinis: et diuitiatum victor: tantum modo glorie auidus.
Sed is natu et per omne~ pueritiam vbi etas militie patiens fuit stipe~dijs faciundis: non greca facundia: ne{que} vrbanis munditi sese exercuit: ita inter artis bonas integrum in genium breui adoleuit.
Ergo vbi primum tribunatum militare~ a populo petit plerisque faciem eius ignorantibus facile notus per tribus declaratur.
Deinde ab eo magistratu alium post alium sibi sem{per}que in potesta+tibus eo modo agitabat: vt ampliore honore {quam} dignus haberetur.
Tamen is ad id locorum talis consulatum non aude bar.
Et iam tum alios magistratus plebs: consulatu~ nobilitas {per} manus inter se tradebat· Nouus nemo tam praeclarus: ne{que} tam egregijs factis erat: quin is indignus illo honore haberetur.
Igitur vbi Marius spicis dicta eode~ quo cupido animi hortabat intendere videt ab Metello consulatum petendi gratia missionem rogat.
Cui {quam} {quam} virtus gloria atque alia optanda su{per}abant: tamen inerat animus et su{per}bia nobilitatis malum.
Itaque primum insolita re mirari eius consilium: et quasi pera micitiam mouere: ne tam praua inci{per}et: neu supra fortunam ai~m gereret. non ominia omnibus cupie~da esse: debere ille res suas satis placere.
Postre~o caueret id petere a po. roma~o quod illi iure negaretur.
Post{quam} haec at{que} alia talia dixit: neque animus Ma+rij flectitur: respo~dit vbi primum {per} negotia publica facturum sese quae peteret.
Ac postea sepe eadem postulanti fertur dixisse: ne festinaret abire: satis ma+ture illum cum filio consulatum petiturum.
Is eodem tempore in co~tubernio patris ibidem militabat a~nos nat{us} circiter viginti.
Quae res Marium tu~ pro honore quem affectabat: pro licentia redeundi quem ab eo impetrare nequibat: contra Metellum vehementer acce~derat.
Ita cupidine at{que} ita pessimis consultoribus gra neque facto vllo neque dicto abstinere: quod modo ambiciosum foret.
Milites quibus in hibernis praecrat laxiore impe+rio {quam} ante habere. apud negociatores quo{rum} magna multitudo Vticae erat: criminose et simul magnifice de bello loqui dia pars exercitus si sibi {per}mitteretur: paucis diebus Iugurtham in cathenis habiturum: ab im+peratore co~sulto bellum trahi: {quod} homo inanis et regie su{per}bie imperio nimis gauderet: Quae omnia illis eo firmiora videbantur: quia diuturnitate belli res familiares corruperat: et animo nihil satis festinatur.
Erat preterea in exercitu nostro numida quidam nomine Gauda Manasta balis fili{us}: Massinisse nepos: quem Micipsa testamento secundum herede~ scripserat: morbis consectus et ob ea~ causam me~te paululu~ imminuta.
Cui Metellus pete~ti more regum vt sellam iuxta ponere: item postea custodie causa turma~ equitum romanorum: vtrum que negauerat: honorem {quod} eoru~ modo foret quos populus romanus reges appellauisset: presidium {quod} co~tumeliosu~ foret: si equites romani satelliti numidae traderentur.
Hunc Marius anxiu~ aggreditur: atque hortatur vt contumeliarum im{per}atoris cu~ suo auxilio penas petat: hominem ob morbos animo paru~ valido secunda oratione ex tollit: illum regem ingen+tem virum Massinissae ne potem esse: si Iugurtha captus aut occisus foret imperium Numidiae sine mora habiturum. id adeo mature posse eue+nire: si ipse consul ad id bellum missus foret.
Itaque et illum et equites romanos: milites et negotiatores alios ipse· pleros{que} pacis spe impellit vti romam ad suos necessarios aspere i~ Metellum de bello scribant· Marium imperatore~ posca~t sic illi a multis mortalibus honestissima suffragatione consulat{us} petebatur.
Simul ea tempe+state plebs nobilitate susa per lege~ manliam extollebat.
INterim Iugurtha post q~ omissa deditione bel+lum incipit: cu~ magna cura parate omnia festinare: exercitum cogere: quae a se formidi~e: aut oste~tan+do praemia affectare: co~munire suos locos: arma la: aliaque quae spe pacm serat reficere aut co~mcari: seruitia ro~arorum allicere: et eosipsos qui i~ praesidijs era~t tentare: prorsus nihil ne{que} quietum pati: cuncta agitare.
Igitur Vacce~ses (quo in initio Iugurtha pacificante presidium i~posuerat) fatigati regis supplicijs: ne{que} antea sua voluntate alienati principes ciuitatis i~ter se co~iurant.
Nam vulgus vti pleru~{que} solet et maxime Numidarum ingenio mobili se+ditiosum atque discordi+osum erat cupidu~ nouarum rerum quieti et otio aduersum.
Deinde co~positis inter se rebus in die~ tercium constituunt {quod} is festus celebratus que per omnem Aphricam: ludu~ et lasciuiam magis {quam} formidinem oste~debat.
Sed vbi tempus fuit centuri ones tribunos{que} militares et ipsum praefectu~ oppidi.
Titum Turpilium Sillanum alius alium in domos suas inuitant: eos oi~s praeter Turpiliu~ inter epulas obtru~cant.
Postea milites palantes: inermes quippe i~ tali die ac sine imperio aggrediuntur.
Ide~ plebs facit pars edocti a nobilitate: alij studi+o talium rerum incitati.
Quis consilium{que} ignoratibus tumultus ipse et res nouae Romani milites metu incerti igati{que} quid potissimu~ facerent trepidare.
Ad arcem oppidi vbi signa et scuta erant praesidium hostium: portae ante clausae prohibeba~t ad hoc mulieres pueri{que} pro+tectis aedificiorum saxa et alia quae locus praebebat certati~ anceps malu~ ne{que} a sortissimis i~ firmissimo generi resisti posse: iuxta boni mali{que} strenui et i~becilles multi obtru~cati sunt.
In ea tanta asperitate saeuissimis numidis et oppido vndique clauso.
Id misericordia ne hospitis an pactio~e an casu ita euenerit parum co~perim{us} nisi quia quod illi in tanto malo turpis vita integra fama fuit improbus videtur.
MEtellus post{quam} de re+bus Vaccae actis co~perit paulis{per} moestuse conspectu abijt.
Deinde vbi ira et aegritu do permista sunt cum ma+xima cura vltu~ ire iniurias festinat.
Legionem cum qua hyemabat et {quam} plurimos po~t numidas equites pariter cum occasu solis expeditos educit.
Et postera die circiter ho+ram tertiam peruenit in qua~dam planiciem locis paulo superioribus circu~uentam.
Ibi milites fessos itineris magnitudine etiam abnue~tes oi~a docet: oppidum Vaccam non amplius mille passuum abesse decere reliquu~ laborem aequo ai~o pati: dum pro ciuibus fuis viris fortissimis at{que} miser+rimis poenas caperent: praeterea praeda~ benigne oste~tat sic animis eorum arrectis equites i~ primo latere: pedites {quam} arctissime ire et signa occultare iubet.
Vaccenses vbi ai~aduerte+re ad se versum exercitu~ {per}gere: pri~o (vti res erat) Metellum esse rati: portas clausere.
Deinde vbi ne{que} agros vastari: et eos qui primi adera~t Numidas equites vident: rursum Iugurtha~ arbitrati cum magno gaudio: obuij procedunt.
Equites et pedites repe~te signo dato alij vulgu~ effusum oppido caedere a+lij ad portas festinare: pars turres capere.
Turpilius quem prefectu~ oppidi vnu~ ex oi~bus profugisse supra ostendimus iussus a Metello causam post{quam} se parum expurgat: conde~natus verberatus{que} poenas capite soluit.
PEr idem te~pus Bomil+char: cuius ipulsu Iu+gurtha deditionem quam metu deseruit ince+perat: suspectus regi et ipse eum suspicans: res cupere ad {per}nicie~ eius dolum quaerere: diu noctu{que} fatigare ai~m: deni{que} oi~a tentanto socium sibi adiungit Nabdalsa~ hominem nobilem magnis opibus clarum acceptu~{que} popularib{us} suis.
Is pleru~que seorsum ab rege exercitum ductare: et oe~s res exequi solitus erat: quae Iugurthae fesso aut maiorib{us} astricto superant: ex quo illi gloria opesque inuente.
Nabdalsa ad exercitum est quem inter hiberna romanoru~ iussus haberet ne ager in vltis hostibus vastaret
Is post{quam} magnitudine facinoris perculsus ad tps non venit metus{que} res im+pediebat.
Bomchar simul cupidus incoepta patrandi: et timore socij an+xius: ne omisso vetere co~+silio nouum quaereret literas ad eum {per} homines fideles mittit i~ quis mol+licie~ secordiam{que} viri accusare: testari deos per quos iurasset monere ne praemia Metelli in pesto~ conuerteret: Iugurthae ex+itum adesse: caeterum sua ne an virtute periret: id modo agitari.
Proinde reputaret animo suo praemia an cruciatum mallet: sed cum literae allatae fuere: sorte Nabdalsa exercitato corpore fessus in lecto quiescebat.
Vbi cognitis Bomilcharis verbis pri~o cura: deinde vti aegrum animum solet: so~nus coepit.
Erat ei numida quidam negotioru~ curator fidus acceptus{que} et oi~m consilioru~ nisi nouissimi parti+ceps.
Qui post{quam} allatas literas audiuit et ex consuetudine ratus o{per}a aut ingenio suo opus esse: ta+bernaculu~ introiuit.
Dor+miente illo eplam super caput in puluino temere positam sumit ac {per}legit Deinde propere cognitis insidijs ad regem pergit Nabdalsa post paulo exprectus vbi neque eplam repperit et rem oe~m vti a+cta erat ex {per}sugis cognouit: primo indicem persequi conatus est post {quam} id frustra suit: Iugurtham placandi gratia accedit: dicit quae ipse facere parauisset {per}fidia clie~tis sui praeuenta: lacrimans obtestatur {per} amicitia~ per{que} sua ante fideliter acta ne super tali scelere suspectum se haberet.
Adea rex aliter {quam} animo gerebat placide respo~dit Bomilchare interfecto alijsque multis quos socios insidiarum cognouit iram oppresserat: ne qua seditio aut bellum ex eo negotio oriretur.
Neque post id Iugurthae dies aut nox vlla quieta fuit: ne{que} loco neque mor+tali cui{quam} aut tempori satis credere.
Ciues hostes que iuxta metuere circu~spectare oi~a et omnistrepitu pauescere: at{que} alio loco saepe co~tra dec{us} noctu requiescere: interdum somno exitus arreptis armis tumultu~ facere: ita formidi~e qua si vecordia agitare.
IGitur Metellus vbi de casu Bomilcharis et in+ditio patefacto ex perfugis cognouit rurfus ta~{quam}ad integru~ bellum cuncta parat festinat{que} Marium fatigantem de profectione simul et inuisum et offensum sibi paru~ ido neu~ rat{us}: domu~ Haec Romae plebs literis quae de Metello et Mario missae erant cognitis volenti animo de ambobus acceperat· imperatori no+bilitas, quae antea dècori fuit inuidie esse.
Caeterum in vtro{que} magis studia partium {quam} mala aut bona sua moderata sunt.
virtutem in ma Denique plebs est accensa vti opifices· aggrestesque omnes: quorum res fidesque in manibus site erant operis frequentarent Mariu~: et vt sua necessaria post illius honorem ducerent.
Ita perculsa nobilitate post multas tempestates nouo homini consulatus mandaret.
Et postea populus a Tribuno plebis Lucio Manlio mancino rogatus que~ vellet cum Iugurtha bel+lum gerere: freque~s Maum
Sed senatus paulo ante Metello Numidiam prouinciam decreuerat ea res frustra erat.
EOdem te~pore Iugurtha amissis amic{is} (quo+rum pleros{que} ipse necauerat: caeteri pars ad romanos: alij ad regem Bocchum profuge+rant) quum neque bellum geri sine ministris posset: et nouorum fidem in tanta perfidia veterum experiri periculosum duceret: varius incertus{que} agitabatur: ne{que} illi res: neque consilium aut quis qua~ hominum satis placebat: itinera profectus que indies mutare: modo aduersus hostes: interdum solitudines pergere: sepe in fuga ac paulo post in armis spem habere: dubitare virtuti an fidei popularin~ minus crederet.
Sed inter eas moras repente sese Metellus cum exercitu ostendit.
Deinde praelium incipitur: qua in parte reae pugnae affuit: ibi aliquan certatum est.
Romam signo et moru~ et aliquanto numero hostium paucoru~ potiti Nam forme numidas in oibus praelijs magis pedes {quam} arma sunt. fuga Iugurtha impe~sius modo rebus suis cu~ perfugis et parte equitat{us} in solitudines: deinde Thalam puenit: id oppidu~ magnu~ at{que} opulentum: ibi pleri+{que} thesauri filiorum{que} ei{us} multus pueritiae cultus erat.
Quae post{quam} Metello· comperta sunt {quam} {quam} inter Thalam flumen{que} pro+ximu~ in spatio miliu~ qui quaginta loca arida at{que} esse cognouerat: tn~ spe patrandi belli si eius oppidi potitus foret: oi~s asperitates superuadere ac naturam etiam vince aggreditur.
Igitur oi~a iumenta sarcinis leuari iubet: nisi frumento dierum dece~.
Praeterea co~quirit ex agris {quam} plurimum potest domiti pecoris: eo{que} imponit vasa cuius{que} modi: sed pleraque lignea collecta ex tugurijs numidarum.
Ad hoc finitimis imperat: qui se post regis fugam Metello dedidera~t: {quam} plurimu~ vt quis{que} aquae portaret.
Ipse flumine: quam proxima~ oppido aquam esse supra diximus: iumenta onerat.
Deinde vbi ad id loci ventum est quo numidas praecepe+rat et castra posita munita{que} ta~ta repente ce+lo missa vis aquae dicitur vt ea modo exercitui: satis super{que} foret.
Praeterea co~meatus spe amplior: quia numidae (sicuti pleri{que} faciunt) i~ no+ua deditione officia inte~derant: Caeterum milites pro religione pluuia magis vsi. Ea{que} res multum animis eorum addidit.
Deinde postero die co~tra opinionem Iugurthae ad Thalam Oppidani qui se locorn~ asperi+tate munitos credidera~t magna at{que} insolita re {per}culsi: nihilo segnius bellum parare: idem nr~i facere.
Sed rex nihil iam infectu~ Metello credens quippe qui omnia tela: et arma: locos: tempora: denique naturam ipsa~ caeteris imperitante~ industria viceraticum liberis et magna parte pecuniae ex oppido noctu profugit.
Ne{que} postea vllo in loco amplius vna die aut vna nocte mo+ratus simulabat se negotij gratia properare.
At Metellus vbi oppidarios inte~tos simul oppidum et operibus et loco munitum videt: vallo folla{que} moenia circumuenit.
Deinde duobus locis ex copia maxime ido vineas agere eas aggerem et su{per} aggere~ impositis opus et administros
Contra haec oppidani festinare: parare: prorsus ab vtris{que} nihil reliquum fieri: deni{que} romani multo ante praelijs{que} post dies quadra ginta q~ eo ventu~ erat: op+pido modo potiti.
Hi post{quam} muru~ arietibus res{que} suas afflictas vident: aurum et alia quae prima dicuntur domu~ regiam co~porta~t: ibi{que} vino et epulis grauati illa{que} et domum: et semet igni corru~ punt: Et quas victi ab hostibus poenas metuerant eas volentes pendere.
SEd pariter cum capta Thala legati ex oppi+do Lepti ad Metellu~ venera~t: ora~tes vti praesidium praefectum{que} eo mit teret: Amilcharem que~dam ho+minem nobilem factiosu~ nouis reb{us} studere aduer+sum quem ne{que} imperia magistratu~ ne{que} leges va+lerent: ni id festinare in summo periculo suam salute~ et illo{rum} socios fore: Na~ leptitani iam inde a pricipio belli lugurthini ad Bestiam consulem: et postea romam milera~t amicitia~ societate~{que} rogatu~.
Dei~de vbi ea impetrata fuere sem{per} boni fideles{que} er cu~cta a Bestia Albino Metello{que} im{per}ata gnauiter fecera~t.
Id oppidu~ a sydonijs co~ditum est quos accepim{us} pro fugos discordias ciuiles nauibus in eos lo+cos venisse.
Caeterum situ~ inter duas Syrtes qui+bus nomen ex re inditu~.

Igitur eius ciuitatis lingua modo conuersa connubio numidarum. leges cultus{que} plera{que} Sydonica: quae eo facilius retinebant: {quod} procul ab im{per}io regis aetatem agebant.

Igitur Carthaginae duo fratres missi· quibus nomen Philenis erat: matu rauere iter pergere.
Cirene~ses tardius ire: id secordia ne an casu acciderit parum cognoui.
Caeterum solet in his locis te~pus haud secus at{que} in mari retinere hoies.
per loca aequalia et nuda vent{us} arenam humo excitat: ea magna agitata ora oculos{que} implere solet.
Post{quam} cirenenses aliquanto posteriores se esse vident et ob rem corruptam domi poenas metuunt criminari Carthaginenses ante te~pus digressos. co~turbare re~pub.
Sed cum poeni alia~ co~ditione~ tantu~modo aequa~ peterent: Cirenenses optione~ Carthaginensibus faciunt vt vel illi quos fines populo suo quaeterent ibi viui obruerentur: Veleade~ co~+ditione sese que~ in locum velle~t processuros dimittere~t.
Phileni co~ditione probata se{que} vita~{que} suam reipu. co~donauere: ita viui obruti sunt.
Carthaginenses in eo loco Philenis fratribus aras consecrauere: alij{que} illis honores domi instituti.
IVgurtha post{quam} amissa Thala nihil satis fir+mum co~tra Metellu~ pu+tat· per magnas solitudines cum paucis profectus peruenit ad getulos: genus hoi~m ferum incultu~{que} et eo te~pore ignaru~ no+minis romani. eoru~ multitudinem in vnum coegit ac paulatim co~suefacit ordines habere: signa sequi: imperiu~ obseruare.
Praeterea regis Bocchiproximus magnis muneribus et maioribus promissis ad studium sui pellicit: quis adiutorib{us} regem aggressus impellit vti aduers{us} romanos bellum incipíat.
Id ea gratia facilius pronius{que} fuit {quod} Boccus in initio huiusce belli legatos roma~ miserat: foedus et amicitiam petitum.
Quam rem opportunissima incepto bello pauci i~pediuerant. caeci auaritia quis oi~a ho+nesta at{que} inhonesta vendere mos erat.
Verum ea necessitudo apud numidas mauros{que} leuis docitur: {quod} singuli pro opibus quis{que} {quam} plurimas vxores: alij denas alij plures habea~t.
Sed reges eo amplius ita ai~m{us} mul+titudine distrahitur: nullam pro socia obtinet: pa+riter oe~s viles sunt.
Igitur in locum ambobus placitum exercitus co~ue+niunt ibi fide data accepta Iugurtha Bocchi a+nimum oratione accendit: romanos i~iustos profu~da auaritia: co~munes oi~m hostes esse eande~ cau+sam illos belli habere cu~ Boccho qua~ secum et cu~ alijs ge~tibus: libidinem imperandi.
Quis oi~a regna aduersa sunt tum sese: ante paulo carthagine~ses.

at{que} alijs talibus ad Cirtham oppidum co~stituunt {quod} ibi Quintus Me+tellus praeda~ captiuos{que} impedimenta locauerat.
Ita Iugurtha ratus aut capta vebe operae preriu~ sore aut si romanus dux auxilio sui venisset praelio sese certaturos.
Na~ callidus id modo festinabat Bocchi pacem i~ minuere ne moras agita~ do aliud {quam} bella~ mallet.
IMperator post{quam} de regum societate cognouit non temere· ne{que} vti saepeia~ victo Iugurtha co~+sueuerat: oi~bus locis pugnandi copiam facit.
Caeterum haud procul a Cirtha castris munitis re+ges operitur: melius esse ratus cognitis Mauris (quoma~ is nouus host is accesserat ex commodo pugnam facere.
Interim Roma per litteras certior fuit Mario {pro}uinciam numidiam data~.
Nam consulem factumia~ antea acce{per}at quibus rebus supra ac honestu~ percullus: ne{que} lacrimas tenere neque moderari lin guam vt egregius in alijs artib{us} nimis molliter aegritudinem pati.
Quam rem alij in superbiam vertebant: alij bonum ingenium contumelia accensum esse.
Nobis satis cognitum est illum magis honore Marij {quam} iniuria sua excruciatum: ne{que} tam anxie laturum fuisse si adempta prouincia alij {quam} Mario traderetur.
Igitur eo dolore i~peditus et quia stulticiae videbatur alienam rem suo periculo curare: legatos ad Bocchum misit postulatu~: ne sine causa hostis populi romani fieret: habere tu~ magnam copiam societatis amicitiae{que} coniungendae: que potior bello esset: {quam} {quam} opibus suis confideret tame~ non debere certa pro i~cer tis mutate.
Omne Bellum sumi facile: caeteru~ aegerrime desinere: non in eius dem potestate initium eius ac finem esse. incipere: cuiuis etiam ignauo licere deponi autem cum victores velint.
Proinde sibi{que} regno consuleret: neu florentes res suas cum Iugurthae perditis misceret.
Ad ea rex satis placide verba facit: sese pace~ cupere.
Rursus imperator co~tra postulata Bocchi nuntios mittit: ille probare {per}tim alia abnuere.
Eo modo saepe ab vtre{que} missis remissis{que} nuntiis tempus procedere: et ex Metelli voluntate bellu~ intactum trahi.
AT Marius (vt supra diximus) cupientis+sima plebe consul factus post{quam} ei prouincia~ Numidia~ populus iussit: antea ia~ infestus nobilita+ti: tu~ vero multus ferox instare. modo singulos: modo vniuersos ledere.
Dictitare sese consulatu~ ex victis quasi illis spoli a coepisse. alia p~terea ma+gnifica pro se et illis dolentia.
Interim que bello opus erant prima habere: postulare legionibus supplementum: auxilia a populis et regibus sociis{que} accersere.
Praeterea ex latio fortissimu~ quem{que} pleros{que} militia paucos fama cognitos accire: et ambiendo cogere hoies emeritis sti+pendijs proficisci: neque illi senatus {quam}{quam} aduersus erat: de vllo negotio abnuere audebat.
Caeterum supplementum etiam laetus decreuerat: quia ne{que} plebe militiam volente putabatur Marius: aut belli vsum aut studia vulgi amissurus.
Sed ea res frustra sperata· tanta libido cum Ma+rio eundi pleros{que} inuaserat: sese quis{que} praeda locupletem victore~ domum rediturum: alia huiuscemodi ais attrahebant: et eos non paululum oratione sua Marius arrexerat.
Nam post{quam} oi~bus decretis quae postu lauerat: milites scribere vult hortandi causa simul: et nobilitatem (vti consueuerat) exagitandi concionem populi aduocauit.
SCio ego Quirites pleros{que} non ijsdem arti+bus imperiu~ a vobis petere: et post{quam} adepti su~t gerere.
Primo industrios supplices modicos esse: dehirc per ignauiam et supbiam etatem agere.
Nam quo pluris vniuersa respu. est {quam} consulatus aut praetura: maiore cura illam administrari {quam} haec peti debere.
Neq: me fallit {quam}tum cum maximo vestro beneficio negotij sustineam.
Bellu~ simul et aerario {per}cere: cogere ad militiam eos quos nolis offendere: domi foris{que} omnia cura+re et ea agere inter inuidos occursa~tes factiosos: opinione quirites asperius est.
Ad hoc alij si deliquere: vetus nobilitas: maioru~ fortia facta: cognatorum et affinium opes: multae clientelae: omnia praesidio adsunt.
Mihi spes omnes in memet sitae: quas necesse est et virtute et innocentia tutari: nam alia infirma sunt.
Et illud intelligo Quirites omniu~ ora i~ me conuersa esse: aequos bonos{que} fauere: quippe mea benefacta reipu. procedunt: nobilitatem inuadendi me quaerere locum.
Quo mihi acri{us} adnitendu~ est: vti ne{que} vos capiamini: et illi frustrari sit.
Ita ad hoc aetatis a pueritia fui: vt omnes labores et pericula consueta habeam: quae ante vestra beneficia gratuito faciebam vti accepta mercede deseram non est con+silium Quirites.
Illis difficile est in potestatibus tem{per}are: qui per ambitionem probos simulaue~re. mihi qui omnem aetate~ in optimis artibus aegi: benefacere ia~ ex consuetudine in naturam conuertitur.
Bel gerere me cu~ Iugurtha qua~ rem nobilitas aegertime tulit. queso reputate cum animis vestris num id mutari melius sit: si quem ex illo globo nobilitatis ad hoc negotium: aut ad aliud tale mittatis hominem veteris prosapiae: ac multarum imaginum et nullius stipendij: scilicet vt in ta~ta re ignarus omniu~ trepidet: festinet: alique~ ex pplo monitore~ sui officij: ita ple+ru~que euenit vt que~ vos im{per}are iussistis: is sibi im+peratore~ alium quaerat.
At{que} ego scio quirites post{quam} co~sules facti sunt: acta maiorum et graeco{rum} militaria praecepta lege+re coeperunt hoe~s praeposteri: nam gerere {quam} fieri tempore posterius re atque vsu prius est.
Quae illi audire et legere solent eorum partem vidi: alia agomet gessi: q~ illi litteris ego ea milita~+do didici: nunc vos existi+mate facta an dicta pluris sint.
Contemnunt nouitatem meam ego illo{rum} ignauiam: mihi fortuna illis probra obiectantur: {quam}{quam} ego naturam vnam et co~munem oi~m sed fortissimum quem{que} generosissimum esse.
At si iam ex patribus aut Bestiae queti posset me ne an illos ex se gi+gni maluerint: quid responsuros creditis? sese liberos {quam} optimos voluisse? &abQUOD si iure despiciunt me faciant idem maioribus fuis quibus vti mihi ex virtute nobilitas coepit.
Inuident honori meo: ergo inuideant labori in periculis etia~ quoniam {per} haec illu~ honorem coepi.
Veru~ corrupti hoi~es su{per}bia ita aetatem agu~t qua si vestros honores contem+nant: ita hos petunt quasi honeste vixerint.
Nae illi sunt qui diuersissimas res pariter expectant: ignauiae voluptatem et praemia virtutis.
Atque etiam cum apud vos aut senatu verba faciunt plerà{que} oratione maioros suos extollunt eorum fortia facta memorando clariores esse putant: quod contra est Nam quanto eorum praeclarior: tanto horum secordia flagi ciosior.
Et ita se res habet· Maioru~ gloria quasi posteris lumen est: ne{que} bona neque mala eorum in occulto patitur.
Veru~ id quod multo preclari{us} est meamet facta mihi dicere Nu~c videte {quam} in sunt: quod ex aliena virtute sibi arrogant id mihi ex mea non concedu~t: {quod} imagines non habeo: et quia mihi noua nobilitas est: quam certe peperisse melius est {quam} acceptam corrupisse.
Equidem non ignoro: si iam respondere velint a+bunde illis facundam et compositam orationem fore.
Sed in maximo vestro beneficio cum oi~bus locis me vos{que} maledict{is} lacerent non placuit reticere: ne quis modestia~ in conscientiam duceret.
Nam me equidem ex ani+mi sententia nulla oratio laedere po~t: quippe vera necesse est praedicent· falsa vita mores{que} meisu perant..
Sed quoniam ve+stra consilia accusantur qui mihi su~mum honore~ et maximum negotiu~ imposuistis: etiam at{que} etia~ animis reputate num eo+rum poenite~dum sit.
No~ possum fidei causa imagines: neque triumphos aut consulatus maiorum meorum ostendere.
At si res postulet hastas vexillum: phaleras: militaria dona praeterea cicatrices in aduerso corpore.
Hae sunt meae imagines: haec nobilitas non hereditate relicta vt illa sed quae meis laboribus et periculis quaesiui.
No~ sunt composita mea verba: parum id facio: ipsa se virtus satis ostendit.
Ne{que} graecas litteras didici: parum placebat eas discere: qppe quae ad virtutem doctoribus nihil profuerant.
At illa multo optima rei+pu. doctus sum: hostes ferire: praesidia agitare: nihil metuere nisi turpem famam: hyeme~ et aestatem iuxta pati: humi requiescere eodem te~pore inopi am et laborem tolerare.
Ergo his ego praeceptis milites hortabor: neque arcte cola~ illos vt me opulente~t ne{que} gloria~ mea~ laborem illorum faciam.
Nam cum tute per molliciem agas: supplicio cogere: id est dn~m non imperatorem esse.
Haec at{que} alia talia nostri maiores faciendo seque rem{que} pu. celebrauere: quis nobilitas freta ipsa dissimilis moribus: nos illorum aemulos conte~nit et oi~s honores non ex merito· sed quasi debitos a vobis repetit.
Maiores eoru~ oi~aquae licebat illis reliquere: diuicias imagines: memoriam sui praeclaram virtutem non reliquere ne{que} poterant: ea sola ne{que} datur dono ne{que} accipit~.
Sordidum me et incultis moribus aiunt {quod} parum scite conuiuium exorno: neque histrionem vllum ne{que} pluris coquum {quam} vil+licu~ habeo: quae mihi no~ libet confiteri quirites: nam ex parente meo et a lijs sanctis viris ita acce+pi: mu~dicias mulicribus viris laborem conuenire omnibus bonis oportere plus gloriae {quam} diuitiaru~: arma non supellectilem decori esse.
Quin ergo quod iuuat: quod{que} aestimant id sem{per} faciant po+tent vbi adulesce~tiam ha+buere: ibi senectute~ agant in dediti ve~tri et turpissimae parti corpo+ris: sudorem: puluere~: alia talia nobis reli~qua~t quibus illa epulis iucundiora sunt.
Nam vbi se flagitijs dedecora uere turpissimi viri bonorum praemia ereptum ita iniustissime luxuria et ignauia pessime artes illis qui coluere eas nihil officiunt reip. in noxiae cladi sunt.
Nunc quonia~ illis quantu~ mei mores non quantu~ illo{rum} flagicia posceba~t respon+di: pauca de rep. loquar.
Nam quae vs{que} hoc tempus lugurtha~ tutata sunt: oi~a remouistis auaritiam im+peritiam at{que} su{per}biam.
Deinde exercitus ibi est loco{rum} sciens: sed me magis stre~nuus {quam} felix.
Na~ magna pars eius auaritia aut temeritate ducum attrita est.
Qua~obre~ vos quibus in est mi+litaris aetas: adnitimini mecu~: et capessite re~pu.
Ne{que} quem{quam} ex calamita te aliorum aut imperato rum su{per}bia metus coe{per}it Egomet i~ agmine at{que} in praelio consultor idem et socius {per}iculi vobiscu~ ad ero: me vos{que} omnibus in rebus iuxta gera~.
Et profecto dijs iuua~tibus: omnia matura sunt victoria praeda laus.
Quaesi dubia: aut procul essent: tamen omnes bonos reip. subuenire deceret.
Etenim ignauia nemo i~mortalis factus est ne{que} {quam} vti a fore~t optauit magis {quam} vti honestique vitam exigerent.
HViu oratione habita Marius post{quam} plebis ai~os erectos videt propere com stipendio armis at{que} alijs vtilibus naues
Cum his Auium Manliu~ legatum proficisci iubet. ipse interea milites scribere non more maiorum ne{que} ex claibus: sed vti libido erat: capite censos plerosque.
Id factum alij inopia bonorum: per ambitionem co~sulis memoraba~t {quod} ab eo genere celebratus que erat: et homini pote~tiam querenti egentissimus quisque oportunissimus: ne{que} sua chara (quippe q~ nulla sunt) et oi~a cu~ precio honesta videntur.
Igitur marius cum aliquanto maiore numero {quam} decretu~ erat in Aphricam profectus: paucis diebus Vticam aduehit~.
Exercitus ei traditur a Publio Rutilio legato: nam Metellus prospectu~ Marij fugerat: ne videret ea quae audita anim{us} tolerate nequiuerat.
Sed consul expletis legionibus cohortibus que auxiliarijs in agru~ fertilem et praeda onustum proficiscitur: oi~a ibi capta militibus donat.
Deinde castella et oppida paru~ munita natura et viris aggreditur: praelia multa caeterum alia locis facere.
Interim noui milites sine metu pugne adesse: videre fugientes capi aut quem{que} tutissimu~: armis libertatem patriam pare~tes{que} et alia oi~a tegi: gloriam at{que} diuitias queri.
At reges vbi de aduentu Marij cognouere: diuersi in locos difficiles abeunt.
Ita Iugurthae placuerat speranti· mox esfusos hostis inuadi posse romanos sicuti pleros{que} remoto me+tu laxius licentiusque
MEtellus intetea Ro+ma~ profectus: contra spem suam laetis+simis ais excipitur plebi pr~ibus{que} post{quam} decesserat: iuxta charus.
Sed Marius impigre pru+denter que suorum et hostium res patiter atte~dere: cognoscere quid vtrique boni· aut co~tra esset. explorare itinera regum consilia et insidias ante Nihil apud neque apud illos tutum pati.
Itaque et getulos et Iugurtha~ praedas age~tes ex socijs saepe aggre{us} itinere suderat: ipsum{que} rege~ haud procul ab oppido Cirtha
Quae post{quam} gloriosa modo facta ne{que} belli copiam patra~di cognouit: statuit vrbes quae viris aut loco pro hostibus et aduersum se oportunissime era~t singulas circumuenire: ita ratus aut Iugurtham praesidijs nu+datum si ea pateret aut praelio certaturum.
Nam Bocchus nuncios ad eum saepe miserat velle populiro. amicitiam. ne quid a se hostile timeret.
Id simulauerit ne quo inprouisus grauior accederet: an mobilitate ingenij pacem atque bellum mutare solitus paru~ exploratum est.
Sed consul vt co~stituerat· oppida castella{que} munita adire par+tim vi: alia metu aut premia ostentando auertere abhostibus.
primo mediocria gerebat: existimans Iugurtham ob suos tuta~des in manus venturum sed vbi illum procul abesse et alijs negotijs inte~tum accepit: et magis aspera aggredi tempus visum est.
Erat inter inge~tes solitudines oppidu~ ma+gnu~ at{que} valens noi~e Capsa cuius co~ditor Her+cules libys memorabat
Eius ciues apud Iugurtham immunes leni i~perio: et ob ea fidelissimi habebantur: muniti aduersum hostes non moeni bus modo et armis at{que} viris: verum etiam multo magis aspitate
Nam proeter oppido loca propiqua: alia omnia vasta: inculta: egentia aquae: infesta a serpe~tibus: quorum vis (sicuti omnium ferarum) inopia cibi acrior.
Ad hoc natura serpe~tium {per}niciosa: siti magis {quam} alia re accenditur.
Eius potiundi Marium maxima cupido inuaserat: tum propter usum bel+li: tum quia res aspera debatur. et Metellus oppidum Thalam magna gloria coeperat: haud dissimiliter situm munitumque: nisi {quod} apud Thalam non longe a moenibus aliquot sontes erant.
Capsences vna modo atque ea intra oppidum rugi aqua: caeteri pluuia vteba~+tur.
Id ibi{que} et in Aphrica quae procul a mari incultius agebat) eo sacili+us tolerabatur: quia numidae pleru~que lacte et fe+rina carne vescebant et ne{que} salem ne{que} alia irritame~ta gule quaerebant: cibus potus{que} illis aduersus fame~ at{que} sitim no~ libidini ne{que} luxurie erat.
Nam contra tantas difficultates consilio satis prouidere non poterat (quippe etiam frumenti inopia te~tabatur {quod} Numidae pabulo pecoris ma+gis {quam} aruo student.
Et quodcu~{que} seme~ natum fuerat iussu regis in loca munita contulerant.
Ager aute~ aridus et frugum vacuus ea te~pestate: nam aestatis extremum erat).
Pecus omne quod superioribus praedae fuerat: equitibus auxiliariis agendum distribuit.
Aulum Manlium legatu~ cum cohortibus expeditis ad oppidum Larim (vbi stipendium et co~meatum locauerat) ire iubet: dicit{que} se praedabundum· post paucos dies eodem ve~turum.
Caeteru~ in itinere quotidie quadraginta duu~ pecus exercitui per centurias item {per} turmas aequa+liter distribuerat: et ex corijs vtres vti fierent curabat: simul et inopiam frume~ti lenire: et ignaris omnibus parare quae mox vsui forent.
Deni{que} sexto die cum adflumen ventum est maxima vis vtrium effecta o~· Ibi castris leui munime~to positis milites cibum capere at{que} vti simul cum occasu solis egredere~tur paratos esse iubet: omni+b{us} abiectis sarcinis aqua modo se{que} et iume~ta onerare.
Deinde post{quam} visu~ est tem+pus castris egreditur: noctem{que} totam itinere facto consedit.
Deinde tertia multo ante lucis aduentum peruenit in locu~ tumulosum longe a Capsa non amplius duum milium interuallo: ibique {quam} occultissime potest cum omnibus copijs diem opperitur.
Sed vbi dies coepit et Numidae nihil hostile metuentes multi op+pido egressi: repente omnem equitatum: et cu~ his velocissimos pedites cursu tendere ad Capsam: et portas obsidere iubet.
Quae post{quam} oppidani cognouere: res trepidae metus inge~s: ma+lum improuisum.
Ad hoc pars ciuiu~ extra moenia in hostium potestate deprehensa cogere vti deditionem facerent.
Numide puberes in terfecti: alij omnes venu~ dati praeda militibus diuisa.
Id facinus contra ius belli· no~ auaritia· ne{que} scelere consulis est admissu~: sed quia locus Iugurthae opportunus: nobis aditu difficilis: gen{us} hominum mobile infidu~ ante: ne{que} beneficio· ne{que} metu coercitum.
POst {quam} tantam rem egit Marius sine vllo suorum incommodo: magnus et clarus antea maior clarior{que} haberi pit.
Oia non bene consulta modo verumetiam casu data in virtutem trahebantur.
Milites modesto imperio habiti: simul et locupletes ad coelu~ ferre Mariu~.
Numidae magis {quam} vllum mortalem timere postremo omnes socij: ar{que} hostes credere illi aut men tem diuinam esse aut deo{rum} nutu cuncta porte~di.
Sed consul: vbi ea res bene euenit: ad alia oppida pergit: pauca repugna~tibus Numidis capit: plura propter capsensiu~ miseras igni corrumpit. luctu atque caede omnia complentur.
Denique multis locis po+titus ac exercitu incruento: aliam rem aggreditur non eadem as{per}itare qua capsens caeterum haud secus difficilem.
Nan{que} haud longe a flumi~e Mulucha (quod Iugurthae Bocchique regnum disiungebat) erat inter ceteram planiciem mo~s mediocri castello: satis patens in immensum editus: vno per angusto aditu relicto.
Nam per omnia velut opere atque consulto praeceps erat quem locum Marius {quod} ibi regis thesauri erant summa capere inte~dit: sed ea res forte {quam} co~so melius gesta erat.
Nam in castello virorum atque armoru~ satis magna vis· et et fons aque: aggeribus turribus{que} et alijs machi nationibus locus importunus.
Iter castellanorum angu+stum vtrinque precise vinca cu~ ingenti {per}iculo frustra ageba~tur.
Milites ne{que} pro o{per}e consistere propter iniquitatem loci: ne{que} inter sine periculo administrare: optimus cadere aut caeteris metus augeri.
At Marius multis diebus laboribus anxius trahere cum animo suo omitteret ne i~coeptum: qm~ frustra erat: an fortunam ex{per}iretur qua saepe prospera vsus fuerat.
Quae quum multos dies noctes{que} aestua~s agitaret: quidam ex co horribus auxiliarijs miles gregarius aliquantulu~ castris haud procul a latere castelli quod aduersum praeliantib{us} erat: ai~aduertit inter saxa repe~tes cocleas quarum cu~ vnam atque altera~: deinde plures peteret studio legerdi paulatim prope ad su~mu~ mo~ tis egrellus est.
Vbi post{quam} solitudine~ intellexit more ingenij hu+mani cupido difficilia fa+ciundi animum vertit.
Et forte in loco grandis coaluerat inter saxa paululu~ modo prona: flexa at{que} aucta in altitudine~· quo cu~cta gigne~tu~ natura fert.
Cuius ramis modo: modo eminentibus saxis nixus Ligur castelli {quod} cuncti Numidae praeliantibus aderant.
Expioratis omnib{us} quae mox vsui fore ducebat: eodem regreditur non te+mere vti ascenderat: sed tentans omnia et circum+spiciens.
Ita{que} propere adit Marium: acta edocet: hortatur ab ea parte qua ipe desce~+derat castellu~ te~tet: pollicetur se ducem itineris: periculique nihil esse.
Marius cum ligure promissa eius cognitu~ ex pre+sentibus misit: quoru~ vti cuius{que} ingenium erat: itarem difficilem aut facilem nunciare.
Ita{que} ex copia tubicinum et cornicinum quin{que} numero {quam} velocissimos delegit: et cum his praesidio qui forent quatnor centuriones: omnes{que} liguri parere iubet: et ei negotio proximum diem constituit.
Sed vbi ex praecepto ducis tempus visum est paratis compositis{que} oibus ad locum pergit.
Caeteru~ illi qui centurijs praeera~t edocti a duce arma ornatum{que} mutauerunt capite at{que} pedibus nudis vti prospectus nixusque per saxa facilius
Su{per} terga gladij scuta: veru~ ea numidica excorijs po~deris gratia: et offe~sa quo leurus sepere~t.
Igitur praegredie~s ligur saxa et si {quam} vetusta te radices emineba~t laq~is vi~ciebat: quib{us} alleuati milites facilius ascenderent: interdu~ timidos insolentia itineris leuare manu. vbi paulo asperior ascensus erat singulos prae se inermes mitte re Deinde ipse cu~ illoru~ armis sequi. q~ dubia nixu videba~tur potissimum tentare ac saepius eadem ascendens et desce~dens: deinde statim gredie~s caeteris audacia~ addere.
Igitur diu multum{que} fatigati tandem in castellu~ perueniunt desertum ab ea parte {quod} sicut alijs die bus omnes aduersum hostes aderant.
Marius vbi ex nuneijs ea quae ligur agerat cognouit {quam} {quam} tota die intentos praelio suos habuerat: tu~ vero cohortatus est milites: etipse extra vineas egress{us} testudine acta suc cedere: et simul hostem tormentis sagittarijs{que}: et sunditoribus eminus terrere.
At Numidae saepe antea vineis Romanorum sub+uersis item incensis non castelli moenibus sese tutabantur: sed pro muro dies nocles{que} agitare: ac Romanis Mario vecordiam obiectare: militibus nr~is seruitium Iugurthae minari secundis rebus feroces esse.
Interim oibus rema+nis hostibus{que} praelio inte~tis: vtrin{que}: pro gloria pro imperio his: illis pro salute rertantibus: repente a tergo signa canere: ac primo mulieres et pueri qui visum processera~t fugere Deinde vti quis{que} muro proximus erat: post remo cu~cti armati in ermes{que}: quod vbi accedit: eo acrius instare romani: fundere ac pleros que tantummodo saucia+re.
Deinde super occisoru~ vadere corpora: auidi gloriae: certantes murum ascendere: neque quem{quam} omnium praeda morari.
CAeteru~ dum ea res agitur: Lucius Silla questor cum magno equitatu in castra venit qui vti ex lation et socijs exercitu~ cogeret Romae relictus erat.
Sed quoniam nos tanti viri res admonuit idone+um visum est de natura cultuque eius paucis dicere.
Et Lucius Sisenna optime et diligentissime omnium qui eas res dixere {per}secutus: paru~ mihi libero ore locutus videtur.
Igitur Sylla ge~tis patriciae nobilis fuit: familia prope iam extincta maio+rum ignauia.
Literis graecis at{que} latiis iuxta atque doctissime eruditus animo inge~ti cupidus voluptatu~: sed glo+riae cupidior: ocio luxurios{us} esse tamen ab nego+tijs nu~{quam} voluptas remorata e~ nisi {quod} de vxore po+tuit honestius consuli.
Eacundus callidus: et amicicia facilis: ad simulanda negocia altitudo ingenij incredibilis mul+tarum rerum ac maxime pecuniae largitor at{que} illi foelecissimo omniu~ ante ciuilem victoriam nu~{quam} super industriam fortu+na fuit: multi{que} dubitauere fortior an foelicior esset.
Igit Sylla (vt supra dictum est) post{quam} in Affrica~ at{que} in castra Marij cum equitatu venit rudis ante et ignarus belli: solertissimus omnium in paucis tempestatibus factus est.
Ad hoc milites benigne appellare: multis rogantibus· alijs ip~e per beneficia: inuitus acci pere: sed ea properanti us {quam} aes mutuum reddere: ipse a nullo repetere: magis laborate id vt illi {quam} plutimi deberent: atque seria cum humillimis agere.
In operib{us}: in acie atque ad vigilias mult{us} adesse ne{que} iterim (quod praua ambitio solet) consulis aut cuius{quam} boni fama~ laedere: ta~t co~silio ne{que} manu priorem aliu~ pati: pleros{que} anteuenire.
Quibus rebus et artibus breui Mario et militibus factus est.
AT Iugurtha post{quam} oppidum aliosque munitos et sibi vtiles simul et pecuniam magna~ amiserat ad Bocchu~ nu~cios mittit {quam} primu~ in numidiam co+pias adduceret.
Que~ vbi cu~ctari accepit: et dubiu~ belli at{que} pacis rationes trahere: rur sus vti an tea proximos eius donis corrumpit.
Ipsi{que} Boccho pollicetur numidae tertiam partem si aut romani aphrica ex+pulsi aut integris suis finibus bellum compositum foret.
Ita amborum exercitu coniuncto Marium iam in hiberna proficiscentem vix decima parte diei relicta inuadunt: rati noctem quae iam aderat et victis sibi munimento fore: et si vicissent: nullo impedimen+to: {quod} loco{rum} scie~tes erant.
Igitur simul co~sul ex multis de hostium aduentu cognouit et ipsi hostes aderant et prius{quam} exercitus aut instrui aut sarcinas colligere: denique ante {quam} signum aut imperium vilum accipere quiuit: Equites mauri at{que} getuli: non acie ne{que} vllo more praelij: sed cateruatim· vti quos{que} sors co~globauerat: in nostros concurrunt.
Qui omnes trepidi improuiso metu: attamen virtutis memores: aut arma capiebant: aut capie~tes illos ab hostibus defensabant.
Pars equos asce~dere: obuiam ire hostibus: pugna latrocinio magis {quam} praelio similis fieri: sine signis: sine ordinibus pedites{que} permisti caedere alios: alios obtru~care: multos contra aduersos acerri~e pugnantes ab tergo circu~uenire: ne{que} virtus: neque arma satis tegere: {quod} hostes numero plures et vndi{que} circum fusi erant.
Deni{que} romani veteres: noui{que} et ob ea scientes si quos locus aut casus coniunxerat: orbes fa+cere.
Atque ita ab oibus parti+bus simul et tecti et istructi hostiu~ vim suste~taba~t.
Ne{que} i~ eo ta~ aspero negotio Marius territus: aut magis {quam} antea dimisso animo fuit: sed cum turma sua (quam ex sortissimis: magis {quam} ex familiarissimis {per}auerat) vagari passim: ac modo suis labora~tibus succurrere: modo hostes vbi co~fertissimi obstiterant inuadere: manu co~sulere militibus quonia~ imperare co~turbatis oi~bus non poterat.
Iam{que} consumptus erat cum tamen barbari nihil remittere: at{que} vti reges praeceperant: nocte~ pro se rati acrius instare.
Tum Marus ex copia rerum consilia trahit: at{que} vti suis locus es+set: colles duos propinquos inter se occupat.
Quoru~ in vno castris pa+ru~ amplo foris aquae magnus erat: alter vsui oportunior: quia magna parte editus et praecepa pauca munimenta gerebat.
Ipse dis{per}sos milites paulatim non minus hostibus co~turbatis in vnum contrahit.
Ita reges loci difficultate coacti praelio deterre~tur: ne{que} tamen suos longius abire sinunt.
Deinde crebris ignibus factis pleru~{que} noctis barbari more suo laetari: exultare: strepere pedibus: vocibus: et ipsi reges feroces {quod} non fugera~t pro victoribus agere.
Sed ea cu~cta romanis ex tenebris editioribus locis facilia visu magno{que} hortamento erant.
Plurimum vero Marius imperitia hostium co~firmatus {quam} maximum scile~tium haberi iubet: ne sign quidem vti per vigilias solebant canere.
Deinde vbi lux aduentabat: defessis iam hostibus ac paulo ante somno captis: de improuiso victigales: item cohortu~ turmarum: legionum tubicines simul omnes tuba ca+nere et milites clamore~ tollere aut portis erumpere.
Mauri atque getuli igno+to at{que} horribili sonitu repente exciti neque fugere ne{que} arma capere ne+{que} omnino facere aut pro+uidere quic{quam} potera~t: ita cunctos strepitu clamore nullo subuenie~te· nr~is instantibus tumultu: terrore: quasi vecordia acceperat.
Deni{que} omnes fusi fugati{que} arma et signa milita+ria plera{que} capta: plures{que} in eo praelio {quam} omnibus superioribus interempti sunt.
DEinde Marius vti ceperat inhiberna it propter commea+tum. in oppidis mari timis agere decreuit: neque tame~ victoria seco aut insolens factus: sed pariter ac si in conspectu hostium quadrato agmine incedere.
Sylla cu~ equitatu apud dextimos: in sinistra parte Aulus Manlius cu~ fun+ditoribus et sagittarijs: praeterea cohortes ligurum curabat.
Simul consul quasi nullo imposito omnia prouidere: apud omnes ad esse: laudare fortis: et i~crepare moerentis.
Item milites cogebat ne{que} secus at{que} iter faceret castra munire: ex+cubitum in porta cohortes ex legionibus: pro ca+stris equites auxiliarios mittere praeterea alios i~ munimentis su{per} vallum locare vigilias ipse circu~ ire: non ta~ difridentia quae imperauisset {quam} vti militibus exaequatus cum imperatore labor volentibus esset.
Et sane Mari{us} illo alijs{que} t{per}ibus iugurthini belli mag{is} pudore {quam} malo ex+ercitum quod multi {per} a~bitione~ alij {quod} a pueritia co~sueta~ duritia~ que caeteri miserias voca~t: volupta+ti habuisset: nisi tn~ reip. pariter ac saeuissimo im{per} bene at{que} decore oi~a ge+stá sunt.
Igitur quarto deni{que} die haud lo~ge ab oppido Cir+tha vndi{que} simul specula tores citi sese ostendunt.
Sed quia diuersi redeuntes alius ab alia parte atque omnes idem significabant: consul incertus quona~modo acre~ instrueret: nullo ordine co~mutato: aduersum oi~a paratus ibidem opperit
Ita Iugurthae spes frustrata qui copias in quatuor partes distribuerat ratus ex oi~bus aeque alios ab tergo hostibus venturos.
Interim Sylla quem primum hostes attigera~t cohortatus suos turmatim {quam} maxie consertis equis ipse alij{que} mauros inuadunt: Caeteri in vno loco mane~+tes ab iaculis eminus emissis corpora tegere: et si qui in manus venerant obtruncare.
Du~ eo modo equites prae+liantur Bocchus cum peditibus quos Volux filius eius adduxerat neque in priore pugna in itinere morati affuerant: postremam aciem romano{rum} inuadit: Tu~ Marius apud primos agebat: {quod} ibi Iugurtha cum plurimis erat.
Deinde numida cognito Bocchi aduentu clam cu~ paucis ad pedites co~uertit: ibi latine (nam apud numa~tiam loqui didicerat) exclamat nr~os frustra pugnare: ante paulo Marium sua manu inter fectu~: simul gladium sanguine oblitum ostendere quem inpugna satis impigre occiso pedite nr~o cruentauerat.
Quod vbi milites accepere mag{is} atrocitate rei {quam} fide nuntij terre~tur: simul{que} barbari animos extollere et in perculsos acrius inten+dere.
Iam{que} paululu~ a fuga ab erant cum Sylla (profligatis his quos aduersum ierat rediens mauris ab latere incurrit.
At Iugurtha dum sustentare suos: et prope ia~ adeptam victoriam retinere cupit circumue~tus ab equitibus dextra sinistra que omnibus occisis: solus interteia hostium vitabundus erupit.
At{que} interim Marius fugatis equitibus occurrit auxilio suis quos pelli iam acceperat.
Deni{que} hostes iam vndi{que} fusi sunt: tum spectaculum horribile in campis patentibus: Sequi fugere occidi capi equi atque viri afflicti: ac multi vulneribus acceptis· ne{que} sugere posse: ne{que} quietem pati: niti modo ac statim concidere: Postremo omnia qua visus erat constrata telis· armis cadaueribus in+terea humus infecta sanguine.
POstea loci co~sul haud dubie ia~ victor perue+nit in oppidu~ Cyrtha~ quo in initio profectus i~te~derat: eo post quintu~ di+em qua~ iteru~ barbari ma+le pugnauerant legati a Boccho veniunt qui reg{is} verbis ab Mario petiere: duos {quam} fidissimos ad eum mittere: velle de suo et de populi romani co~modo cum his disserere.
Qui {quam}{quam} acciti ibant tamen placuit verba apud regem facere: quo ingenium aut aduersum fle+cterent: aut cupidum pacis veheme~tius accende+rent.
Ita{que} Sylla cuius facundiae non etati a Manlio concessum est: verba pauca huiuscemodi locutus est.
REx Bocche magna nobis laeticia est: cu~ te tale~ viru~ dij monuere: vt aliqua~do pace~ {quam} bellu~ malles neu te optimu~ cum pessimo oi~m Iugurtham miscendo co~ma culares.
Simul nobis demeres acerbam necessitu dinem: pariter et te erra~+tem et illum sceleratissimum {per}sequi.
Ad hoc populo romano iam a principio inopi: melius visu~ amicos {quam} seruos quaerere tutius{que} rati volentibus {quam} coactis imperitare.
Tibi vero nulla opportunior amicitia nostra: primum {quod} procul absumus in quo offensae minimum est: et gratia par ac si prope adessemus. dei~de {quod} pare~tes abunde habemus.
Amicorum ne{que} nobis ne+que cui{quam} hoim satis fuit Atque hoc vtinam tibi a principio placuisset: profecto ex populo romano ad hoc te~pus multo plura bona accepisses: {quam} mala perpessus esses.
Sed quoniam humanaru~ rerum fortuna pieraque regit: cui scilicet placuit vim et gratiam nostram te experiri nunc quonia~ per illam licet festina at{que} vti coepisti perge.
Multa opportuna habes quo facilius errata officijs superes. postre~o haec in pectus tuum demitte nun{quam} populum romanum beneficijs victum esse.
ADea Bocchus placide et benigne simul pauca pro delicto suo verba facit: se no~ hostili ai~o sed ad regnu~ tutandum arma cepisse.
Nam Numidiae partem vnde Iugurtham expulerit iure belli suam factam eam vastari a Mario pati nequiuisse.
Caeterum vete+ra omittere: si per Marium liceret legatos ad senatum missurum.
Deinde copia facta mittendi animus barbari ab amicis flexus quos Iugurtha cognita legatione Syllae et Manlij metuens id quod parabat donis corruperat.
MArius interea in hibernis co~posito cu~ expeditis cohortib{us} et equitarus {pro}ficiscitur in loca sola turrim regiam quo Iugurtha perfugas oe~s praesidium imposuerat.
Tum rursus Bocchus scilicet erga roma~os seu reputando quae sibi duobus praelijs euenera~t seu monitus ab alijs amicis quos Iugurtha incorruptos reliquerat ex omni copia necessariorum qui{que} delegit: quorum et cognita et igenia validissima erat.
Eos ad Marium: ac deinde si placeat Romam legatos ire iubet: agendarum rerum et quocun{que} modo belli componendi lice~ciam {per}mittit. illi mature ad hyberna tomanorum proficiscuntur.
Deinde in itinere a Getulis latronib{us} circumuenti spoliatique pauidi sine decore ad syllam profugiu~t: quem co~sul inexpeditionem proficiscens pro praetore reliquerat.
Eos ille no~ pro vanis hostibus vti meriti era~t sed liberaliter habuit.
Quare barbari et famam romanoru~ auaritiae falsam et Syllam ob munifi centiam in sese amicum esse rati suut.
Na~ etiam tu~ largitio multis ignora erat. munificus etiam nemo putabatur nisi pariter volens dona omnia i~ benignitate habebant~.
Igitur quaestori mandata Bocchi patefaciunt: simul ab eo petu~t: vti fautor consultor{que} sibi adsit. copias fidem magnitudinem regis sui: et alia quae aut vtilia: aut beneuolen+tiae esse credebant: oratione extollunt.
Deinde Sylla omnia pollicito: docti{que} quomodo apud Marium item apud senatum verba facerent circiter dies ibidem .xl. opperiuntur.
MArius post{quam} infecto negotio quo inte~de+rat redit Cyrtha~: de adue~tu legatoru~ certi+or fact{us} est ilios{que} Sylla~ ab Vtica venire iubet ite~{que} Luciu~ Bellienum praetore~ praeterea omnes vndique senatorij ordinis: quibuscum ma~data Bocchi cognoscit: in quis legatis potestas eundi Romam fit: et ab consule in+terea induciae postula~tur Ea Syllae et pleris{que} placuere. pauci ferocius decernunt ignari rerum hu+manarum: quae fluxae et mobiles semper in aduer+sa mutantur.
Caeterum mauri impetra+tis rebus tres Romam profecti cum Cneo Octauio Rufo: qui quaestor stipendium in Aphri+cam portauerat.
Ex his Boc+chus cum caetera: tu~ maxime benignitate~: et studium Syllae libens accepit.
Romae{que} legatis eius post{quam} errasse regem et Iu+gurthae scelere lapsu~ dep~ sunt: amiciam et foedus perentibus hoc modo respondetur.
Senatus et populus romanus beneficij et iniuriae memor esse solet.
Caeterum Boccho quoniam poenitet delicti grati+am facit. foedus et amicitia dabu~tur cu~ meruerit.
QVis rebus cognitis Bocchus {per} lit+teras a Mario pe+tiuit vti Sillam ad se mitteret.
Is miss{us} cu~ p~sidio equitu~ at{que} peditu~: ite~ fundito{rum} et
Pre+terea iere sagittarij: co+hors peligna cu~ velitaribus armis itineris prope+ra~di causa ne{que} sec{us} his at+{que} alijs armis aduersu~ tela hostiu~{quod} ea leuia su~t mu+niti erant.
Sed in itinere quinto denique die Volux filius Bocchi repente in campis patentibus cum mille non amplius equitibus sese oste~dit: qui temere et effuse euntes Syllae alijs{que} omnibus et numerum ampliorem: et hostilem metum efficiebant.
Igit se quisque expedite: arma at{que} tela tentare: intendere: timor aliqua~tus sed spes amplior: quippe victoribus et aduersu~ eos quos saepe vicerant.
Interim equites exploratum premissi rem vti erat quiet a~ nuntiant.
Volux adueni+ens quaestorem appellat: dicit{que} se a patre Boccho obuiam illi simul et praesidio missum.
Deinde per illu~ et proximu~ die~ sine metu comuncti eunt.
Post vbi castra locata: et diei vesper erat repe~te Maurus incerto vultu paue~s ad Syllam accurrit dicit{que} sibi a speculatorib{us} cognitu~ haud procul Iugur tham abesse.
Ille animo feroci negat se toties susum numidam virtuti suo+rum satis credere: etiam si certa pestis adesset ma~surum potius {quam} pro ditis his quos ducebat turpi fuga incertae ac forsitan post paulo i~teriturae morbo vitae parceret.
Caete{rum} ab eode~ monitus vti noctu prosicisceretur: consilium approbat: ac statim milites coenatus esse i~ ignes{que} {quam} creberri mos fieri: deinde pri~a vigilia sile~tio egredi iubet.
Iam{que} nocturno itinere omnibus Sylla pariter cum ortu solis castra metabatur: cu~ equites mauri nunciant Iugurtham circiter duum milium interuallo ante eos consedisse.
Quod post{quam} auditum est: tu~ vero ingens metus nostros inuadit: credere se prodi+tos a Voluce et insidijs circumuentos.
Ac fuere qui dicere~t manu vindicandum ne{que} apud illum tantum scelus inultu~ relinquendum.
At Sylla {quam} {quam} eadem existimabat tn~ ab maurum prohibet suos hortatur vti fortem animum gererent.
Saepe antea paucis stre~nuis ad+uersus multitudinem bene pugnatum· quanto sibi in praelio minus peper cissent: ta~to tutiores fore. ne{que} que~quam decere qui manus armauerit ab inermibus pedibus auxilium in maximo metu nudum et cecu~ corpus ad hoste~ vertere.
Deinde Volucem (qm~ hostilia faceret) louem maximu~ obtestatus: vt sceleris at{que} praefidiae Bocchi testis adesset: castris abire iubet.
Ille lacrima~s orare ne ea crederet: nihil dolo factu~: ac magis calliditate Iugurthae cui vi+delicet specula~ti iter suum cognitum esset.
Caeteru~ quoniam ne{que} ingentem multitudine~ haberet spes opes{que} ex pa+tre suo penderent crederet illum nihil palam ausurum: cum ipse filius testis adesset.
Quare optimum factu videri per me+dia ei{us} castra palam tra~sire sese praemissis vel ibide~ relictis mauris solum cum Sylla iturum.
Ea res vti i~ tali negocio solet probata est: ac stati~ profecti: quia de improuiso acciderat dubio atque hesitante Iugurtha incolumes transeunt.
IBi cum Boccho quida~ numida Asper nomine multum et familiariter agebat: praemissus a Iugurtha post{quam} Sylla~ accitum audierat oratu~ et subdole speculatum Bocchi consilia ierat.
Praeterea Dabar Massagradae filius ex gente Massinissae caeterum materno genere impar (Nam mater eius ex eoncubina orta erat) Mauro ob ingentia facta charus acceptus{que} quem Bocchus fidu~ multis antea tempestatibus expertus illico ad Syllam nunciatu~ mit tit paratu~ sese facere quae populus romanus vellet col+loquio: diem: locum: tempus: ipse consul to sese omnia cum illo in+tegra habere neu Iugurthae legatum pertimesceret: {quod} eo aduocatus esset quo res comunis licenti+us gereretur: nam ab insidijs eius aliter sibi cauere nequiuisse.
Sed ego co~perio Bocchu~ magis punica fide: {quam} ob ea quae praedicabat simul romanos et numidam pacis detinuisse multum{que} cum suo animo voluere solitu~ Iugurtham romanis an illi Syllam tra+deret: libidinem aduersu~ nos: metu~ pro nobis suasisse.
Igitur Sylla respo~dit pauca coram aspare locuturum caetera occulte aut nullo praesente aut {quam} paucissimis: simul edocet: q~ sibi responderent
Post{quam} sicuti voluerat co~grei: dicit se missu~ a co~sule venisse quae situm ab eo pacem an bellum agitaturus foret.
Tum rex (vti praeceprum fuerat) post diem decimum redire iubet.
SEd vbi plerum{que} noctis processit Sylla a Boccho occulte accer+sit ab vtro{que} tantu~modo fidi interp~tes adhibent
Praeterea Dabar internu~+cius sanctus iurat ex sente~tia ambobus: acstatim sic rex incipit.
Nun{quam} ego ratus sum vti rex maximus i~ hac terra et omniu~, quos noui, opulentissimus priua+to homini gratiam debere~: et me Sylla ante te cognitum multis ora~tibus alijs vltro egomet opem tuli: nullius i~digui.
Id esse imminutum quod caeteri dolere solent ego letor: fuerit mihi eguisse aliquando praecium tuae amicitiae: qua apud animum meum nihil chari{us} habeo: id adeo li+cet arma: viros: pecunia~ postremo quicquid ai~o li+bet sume: vtere: et quo ad viues nun{quam} tibi reddi tam gratiam putaueris: sed semper apud me integra erit.
Nam vt ego existimo regem armis {quam} munificentia vinci minus flagitiosum.
Caeteru~ de republica vestra cui{us} curator huc mis+sus es paucis accipe.
Bellum ego populo romano ne{que} ne{que} factum vn{quam} volui fines meos aduersum armatos tutatus sum.
Gerite vti vultis cum Iugurtha bellum. ego flumen Mulucham quod inter me et Micipsam suit non egrediar.
Ad ea Sylla pro se breuiter et modice: de pace de q: co~munibus rebus multis disseruit.
Denique regi patefecit: quod polliceatur senatu~ et pplm romanum: quoniam armis amplius valuissent non in gratiam habiturum: aliquid quod illorum magis {quam} sua retulisse videre tur: id adeo in esse quoniam copiam haberet: quem si romanis tradidisset fore vt illi plurimum de beret amicitiam: sedus: Numidiae partem quam nunc peteret: tunc vltro aduen+turam.
Ad hoc metuere ne fluxa fide vsus populariu~ animos auerteret. quis et Iugurtha charus et romani inuisi erant.
Deni{que} saepius fatigatus et ex voluntate Syliae omnia se fact urum promittit.
Caeterum ad simulandum pacem cuius numida defessus bello auidissimus erat: quae vtilia visa sunt constituunt.
AT rex postero die Aspere~ Iugurthae appellat di+cit{que} sibi {per} Dabare~ ex Syl+la cognitu~ posse co~ditionibus bellu~ sui sententia~ exquireret.
Deinde cu~cta ab illo edoctus properato itinere post diem octauum redit ad Bocchum et ei nunciat Iugurtha~ cupere omnia quae imperare~tur facere sed Mario paru~ confidere.
Caete{rum} Bocchus si am+bobus consulta~ et pacem vellet: daret opera~ vt vna quasi de pace in colloquium conneniret ibi{que} Sylla~ sibi traderet· cum talem virum in pote+state habuisset tum fore vti iussu senatus ac populi romani foed{us} fieret: ne{que} homine~ nobilem no~ sua ignauia captum: sed ob remp. in hostium pote+state relictum
Caeterum dolo an in re cunctatus paru~ co~perimus sed plerum{que} regiae voluntates vt vehementes sic mobiles: saepe sibi aduersae.
Postea te~pore et loco con+stituo in colloquium vti de pace co~ueniretnt Boc+chus Syllam modo: modo Iugurthae legatum ap+pellare: benigne habere: idem ambobus polliceri: illi leti pariter ac spei bo+nae esse pleni: sed nocte ea quae proxia ante diem colloquio decretum maurus adhibit{is} amicis ac statim immutata volu~+tate remotis a se caeteris dicitur secum multa agitauisset: vultu colore ac motu cor{per}is pariter at{que} animo varius quae scilicet ipso tacente occulta pectoris oris immutatio+ne patefecit.
Tamen postremo Syllam accersiri iubet: et ex sentencia numidae insidi as tendit.
Deinde vbi dies aduenit et ei nunciatum Iugurtham haud longe esse cu~ paucis amicis et nostro quasi obui{us} honoris causa procedit i~ facillimum insidiantibus eodem numida cum pleris{que} necessarijs suis inermia vti dictum erat accedit: ac statim signo dato vndi{que} simul ex i~ sidijs inuadit
Caeteri obtru~cati Iugurtha vinctus Syllae et ab eo ad Marium deductus est.
¶Per idem te~pus aduersum Gallos ab nostris Qui~to Scipione et Caio Manlio male pu+gnatum est.
Illi{que} et denique omnes romani vs{que} ad nostram memoriam sic habuere: alia omnia virtuti prona esse: cu~ pro salute non pro gloria cer+tare.
Sed postq~ bellum in Numidia co~fectum et Iugur+tham Romam vinctu~ ad duci nuntiatum est.
Marius consul absens factus est et ei decreta proui~cia gallia.
Ex ea tempestate spes at que opes ciuitatis in illo sitae.

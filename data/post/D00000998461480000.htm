¶Grace from god the father, and from our lorde Iesu Cryste, wyth the assystence of the holy goste.
WHere as co~syder crysten reders, the dau~ger of wry+tyng in ye {per}yllous season of these latter days, lar+gely depaynted by sait Paule euen as it now in dede that certayne persons departe from the fayth, and gyue hede to dysceytfull spyrytys and de+uelysh doctrine, through simu+lacio~ of fals wordis by whose meanys it ys come so to passe, that a lytle fawte ys not onely taken to the worste but what so euer ys well done, spoke~, or wryte~, ys oftymys interpretyd amysse: no maruell though so vnlernyd greatly abash to put my selfe in ieo{per}dy of these swords wolfys pytys sowle murtherers, whych byte wyth theyr teeth prech peace with theyr tongys seyng that famous clerkys of pregnante wyttys, of excele~t erudycyon, synguler vertew, haue so ly+tle auayled wrytyng agaynst theym: not that these new techers fo auncyent heresyes, late auctours of old inueterat syfmys, arso {pro}found in know+lege of scryptures, eyther so in+uyct of resonable argume~tys, that they haue not bene many tymys ouercome as theye be dayly va~queshyd but because of theyre shameles {per}tynacyte, where as theye be prostrate lye grouelyng vppo~ ye grou~d, dystytute of reasone, voyde of good argumentys, wythout any fence of treuth the~ strogle they to woorey men wyth wor+dys of conuycyous malediccy+ons and sedycyous slau~ders, not afrayd to dyspyce theyr so+uerayns wythowte regarde of theyr power, contemnynge all auctoryte contrary to the doctryne of saynt Peter, sayng: Be ye subgect to euery ma~ for our lordys sake vnto ye kynge as chefe, and vnto the gouernours as to those that are sent by hym for the ponyshment of the euyll rewarde of the well doers: for so is ye wyll of god, that doyng well ye may stopp the mouthys of folysh and ignorant people, as free and not as a colour hauyng the lybertye of malyce, but as ye seruau~tys of god.
Notwythstandyng in theyre solempne prefacyes and payntyd tytles of theyr er+rous they begynne wyth dulcet salutacyo~s of glosyng perswasyons, vnder the pretence of a godly zele oftymes repetyng the worde of god, the gos+pell of Cryste, hys promyses, hys charyte &c. whereby they wolde {per}swade to rude people that what so euer theye wryte or teche, are the same thyngys be the neuer so contrary euen as the comen sorte of vngracy+ous wretchys do, whych in lyes report of slau~ders, will call into theyr recorde the trouth of god, the holy euange+lystys, the blessyd sacrame~tys, and all the mysteries of our be fleef: not for any faythefull reuerence towarde them but to the~tent that they myght be bet+ter beleuyd in theyr falsehod.
Many thyngys whyche are put forthe vnder the tytle of ye worde of god, ys not hys trew+word in effecte nomore tha~ all those whyche bere the name of crysten men, be not all crysten men in trouth dede.
Man ly+uyth not onely by brede sayth scrypture, but in euery word yt comyth owte of the mouthe of god.
Mark here cristen reders the worde that procedyth of ye mouth of god to yt whych we oughte nother to adde, nor to take any thyng away from yt. Arrius, Pelagius, Manicheus wyth such other, whom the more parte of these confesse to be heretykys dylygentely layd the worde of god for them, but not owte of hys mouth: for they applyed it by wrong interpretacyons to the settyng forthe of theyr heresyes, and not to ye glory of god.
Saynt Paule helyd syk folk draue the wykked spyrytys from them that were possessyd through goddys worde in the name of Iesu whose doyng ye chylderne of Sceue assayd to cou~terfete wyth lyke wordys: to who~ the spyryte answeryd: know Iesu and Paule, but what ar ye? and so greuously assawtyng them he preuayled agaynste theyr presumpsyon.
The aged prophet of Bethell, by whose dysceyte the man of god sent out of Iuda to Iero+boham was slayne: allegyd ye worde of god.
The false prophete Sedechias wyth hys co~+pany .iiii. C. in nomber, falsely promysed kyng Achab vyctory to hys destruccyon layeng for theyr auctoryte the worde of god.
Ananias resysted the trew prophete Ieremye prophesyeng to the captyue Isra+helytys lybertie and sone dely+uerance of theyr bondage, cau+syng, them to trust in hys leasyng, whyche he sayd was the worde of god.
And generally all other false prophetys bostyd theym selfys to be sente of god, ca~ to preche hys trouth, whom he neuer dyd sende as he wytnessyth with hys owne mouth in diuers placys of the
all suche as occupy inchau~tmentis, con+iurers, wytches, in theyr busynes wyth many cerymonies reherse the worde of god Also our sauyour cryste sayth that many shall come in hys name sayng: am Cryste, and they shall dysceue many but how? surely in perswadynge yt theyr doctrine ys goddys word and that they be hys messengers, hys anoyntyd sonnys and spe+cyall prophetes.
So dyd Symon Magus delude the peple of Samary, affermynge yt he was Cryste.
Lyke wyse Machomete namyd hym selfe the great prophete of god.
And all othere heretykys comenly in fortefyenge theyr abhomynable heresyes, allege the worde of god euangelyke veryte, according as Martyn Luther wyth the hole rable of hys adhere~tes do dayly practyse.
But what auayleth yt to recyte the worde of god, yf we interprete yt by a false peruertyd sence? what auauntage ys yt to say Lord Lorde, and do not as he comau~dyth vs? He yt saythe knowe god, and obserueth not hys commaundementys ys a lyer, and there ys no trothe in hym.
The pharyseys dyicyples sayd to Cryste: Mayster we knowe yt thou arte a trewe speaker, thou teachest ye way of god in trothe yet thought they nothynge so in theyr hartes· what thyng ys more easy for these new teachers, tha~ in blasynge theyr auctoryte to say that theyr doctryne ys the trewe worde of god, and that they haue hys spyryte: where as they admitt no interpretaci+on of scripture but theyr own in so moche that they reiecte parte of the byble because yt seruyth not to theyr purpose.
Concernyng ye determynacyo~ of generall councellys, auctoryte of auncyente doctours of the churche they vtterly co~temne, except in few thynges whereowt they gather sente~cyes whyche deprauyd othere whyle changed clene contrary to the auctoures intent they make to serue in colourynge theyr heresye.
How shall wee then knowe whether they be the ryght preachers, theyre doctryne the worde of god or no? Trewly Cryste geuyth vs a rule infallyble, sayenge: By theyr frutes ye shall knowe theym.
good tree can brynge forthe no euyll frute, nor a badde tree cane brynge forthe no good frute.
And they whych here the worde of god wyth an ernest and good hart they holde yt faste, bryngynge forthe frute in Also saynt Iames descrybynge the expedyent condycyon of cryste~ prechers and heuenly lernyng sayth: who that amonge you ys wyse endued wyth co~ming lette hym shew hys good workes out of a good conuersacio~ wyth softenes of wysdome.
If ye haue sower hatred and varyaunce amonge you in youre harte wyll not ye reioyce be+lyers agaynste the trothe? for thys ys not the wysdome comyng fro~ aboue, but yerthly, bestyall deuelysh. where as ys enmyte contencyon there is inco~stancy and all noughty doyng.
The wysdome yt desce~dyth from god ys furst chaste, and so peasable mylde, treata+ble, full of mercy and good fru+tys, wythout any mysdemyng or dyssymulacyon.
Now to compare these frutys vnto the actys of these Lutheran faccy+ons ye shall finde a farre wherfore seyng that by longe experyence haue the fassion, maner, and order of all statys among the~, was no small whyle conuersaunt wyth those whych are of hyest reputacio~, both for theyr sobernes of lyfe and fame of ly+terature: haue thoght yt ne+cessary for the discharge of my conscyence, informacyon of other playnly to shew the veryte as haue knowen, wyth+out hatred of them or fauoure of any other {per}sons: whych to {per}forme haue here co~pylyd thys lytle processe folowyng, vnder the forme of a brefe dya+loge. wherein though ye shall rede some thyngys so strange for the enormytees of them, ye diuers men, namely the fauou+rers of these sectys, wyll iudge them vnlykely of trouthe, and halfe impossyble to be vsyd amo~g resonable people endued wyth any wysdome or lerni~g: yet are they matter in dede, accordyng as ye shall see vnfaynydly declared.
And be ye full assured that reherse not by a great parte all the abusys ma+nyfestly knowen by the~ nor so many as coud shew: which god wyllyng hereafter in proces of tyme may be dysclosyd more largely.
great occa+syon why yt many be so ferue~t in fauouryng thys Lutherane doctryne ys the vayn prayses of much people comyng from reporting that there is so good order, such charytable lyberalyte, and euangelyke co~+uersacyon, whych ys all to gether false.
And dyuers of such tydyng cariers, lest they might seme ignorante in a few thyngys they frame theym selfys wythowt shame to lye in many.
It ys harde for a renegate frere, a faythelesse apostata, a forlorne copeman, a marchau~+tys pre~tyce, or a~ embassatours hostler hauyng lytle lernyng, lesse dyscressyon, small deuocy+on, and scant a curtesy of wysdome: to make trew report in such matters.
And yet ar there of them which make the~ selfys full besy and ar as redy to tell that they know not as yt that they know accordyng as they fele theyr affeccyons desposyd whom they couet to please: by whyche meanes they attayne hye co~mendacio~s, made much of, ar callyd prety wyse me~ pro{per} {per}so~s, wyth many godd blessyngys vppon theyr hartys.
Such ys the madnes of ye world and folysh appetytys of people, p~ferryng theyr corrupt affeccyons before ryghte iugeme~t and testymony of theyr conscyence.
Trothe yt is that ye Germayns of old antiquite, haue deserued specyall lawde for theyr playnes in word and dede voyd of dyssymulacyon, for theyr homely famylyary+te wythout accepcio~ of {per}sons in whyche vnto thys day they excell other nacyo~s: wherof ye originall cause many falsly do ascrybe to thys Lutheran doc+tryne, beyng dowtlesse meruelously decayd through yt so ye trew playnesse was not wont to be so scace there among sca~t good liuers, as frawdis begin now to be plenty among theyr new gospellers. wherefore (crysten reders) exhorte you all {per}cyalyte sett a parte to fyx your selfe vppon the lyuynge worde of god whych may saue your sowlys, and walk dyrect+ly after yt bowyng nother on the one syde nor on the other.
mene not that fleshly word nor theyr gospell whych say: ye haue no fre will, your good deedys shall not saue you, nor youryll dedys shall not da~pne you, ye sacramentys of ye chirch be nothing of necessite, ye nede not to be confessyd to a preest, ye are not bownde to obey the lawes of ye chyrch &c. but that trew worde of god very gospell of our sauyour Cryste of whose furste sermon the antetheme was thys: Doo ye penau~ce for ye kyngdome of god ys at hande.
And at hys laste farewell fro~ hys dyscyples he aermyd ye same, sayenge yt in hys name yt behoued penau~ce to be preachyd in remyssyon of synnes: whych maner of preachyng the apostles after his assencyon obseruyd, co~tynually exhortyng the people vnto penau~ce and to the drede of god whyche ys the begynnynge of wysdome, the inseperable com+panyon of penaunce, necessa+ry introduccyon to fayth.
The worde of god bryngyth forthe pena~ce accordyng as we rede in the actes of thapostles yt at saynt Peters preching they were compuncte in harte, and them selfe to penaunce.
Thys vnfayned penaunce lea+dyth men to faythe, and is the e~tre to the gospell.
Do ye penaunce sayth Cryste, and beleue ye gospell. whych belefe can not be attayned wythoute the drede of god.
For it is the fulnes of scyence whereby we co~e downe fyrst to know oure+self so asce~d to ye knowlege of god by hys word, whereout through heryng fayth taketh her effect.
The maiestie of god+dis worde is of that nature to prostrate presumpcyon of mannes wysdome affyau~ce in our selfes, exylyng thaffecci+o~s of carnall liberte, mouing vs with a redynes of mynde certayn trymblyng fere to say with saynt Paule, Lord what wyllest thou vs to do? Thys reuerent drede had Cornelius Centurio, wha~ the ioyfull mes+senger of god apperede vnto hym to who~ with fere abashed he Lorde who art thou? in whose commendacyon it is writen there, Actorum.
the shepe+herdys whan ye angell of glad+tydynges appered to them, ye brightnes of god shone rou~d about the~: hauyng thys drede were astonyed in them selfys to who~ the angell spake: Be not afrayd shew you gre+at ioy yt shall be to all people, for there is borne a sauyoure whych is Cryste our lorde.
the peo+ple feared god, and so be leued hym hys seruaunt Moyses.
And they yt drede god saythe the wyseman shall not be vnfaythefull to hys worde.
Also saynte Iohan reherseth in his Apocalypse sayng: saw an angell fleyng by the myddys of heuen, hauyng ye euerlasti~g gospell that he shulde preche to the dwellers vppon yerthe, to euery nacyon, trybe, and tonge, and people sayng with a great voyce: Feare ye god.
But now comith the angell of Sathan wyth hys idle iustify cacyons and vayn promyses clene contrary perswadyng yt we nede no workis of penau~ce nor satysfaccyon for oure synnes, syth Cryste hath satysfied for vs all redy onely to beleue is wythdrawyng peo+ple fro~ the godly drede.
Howe+beyt leste hys dysceyt shuld be easely perceyued: he transfygureth hym selfe in to a trewe angellys lyknes sometyme te+chyng vertuouse maners, bro+therly charytie, thexample of Crystes actys oure nedefull acco~plyshment of the~ wherin he wold seme to profite a few, to theintent he myght begyle many.
And dyuers of hys dyscyples cou~terfeyting the apostles fassyon: otherwhyles allege scryptures in theyr ryght sencyes, wyth ye same deuowte synceryte that Sathane hym selfe dyd in temptynge Cryste whe~ he sayd to him: God hath co~maunded hys angellys &c. whych was ye very scrypture truely recyted all though to a wronge purpose.
But where as he in his owne perso~ cowld not ouercome Cryste our hed: he ceassyth not to supplant vs hys crysten members by hys fals dyscyples ys lyke styll to preuayle (our merytes deseruing ye wrath of god) except he of hys infynyte goodnes gracyous pyte, vouchsafe to reconcyle vs agayn vnto hys fauoure be our protectour: whose mercy ys ye onely staye that we be not all consumyd.
Therfore lett vs drawe nere wyth confidence to the throne of grace yt we may gett mercy and fynde grace to helpe vs at nede contynually hauynge in our remembraunce the voyce of the angell sayeng: Fere ye god and gyue hym honoure, for the houre of iugement co~meth.
And worshyppe ye hym that made heuen and yerth, the see, and fountayns of waters to whom be for euer wythowte end.
NOw welcome good brother fro~ parties of beyonde the see.
Wee haue sore longyd for your safe re+torne hopynge to here some newes from oure euangelyke brotherne of Germany, and in what maner the gospell dothe prosper there go forwarde.
How beyt concernyng your desyre, to be certefyed of them who~ ye call eua~gelyke brothern: assure you vnfaynyngly that lyke theyr maner euery day worse worse.
N. What haue ye so sode~ly cha~ged your minde, and begynne now to fall from the gospell forsakyng goddys worde? →W. Truly haue chaunged my mynde from errours and wrong oppynyo~s but neuer entendyng to renye goddys worde or Crystes gos+pell: wherof as farre as ca~perceyue they be destitute and mych wyde. N.
To proue yt it were impossible seyng ye ca~+not denye but that they haue Crystes gospell in theyr vul+gare speche ipre~ted fre for eue+ry body to loke vppo~ wyth co~+tynuall exercyse of euangelyk preachyng of goddys worde.
In very dede they haue the exteriour letter, with some outwarde apparaunce of zele towarde it.
But for all that as towchyng an euangelyke lyfe or a crysten co~uersacyon, with faythfull frutys behouable to ye same: they be neuer a deale nerer in effecte than were the Iewes, whyche wolde haue made Cryste theyr kynge not for any syncere loue that they had to folow him in vertuous lyuyng· or for reuere~ce of hys godly worde but onely in that they thought he wold haue sa+tised theyr carnall appetitys sedycious affeccyons: wher+of to be auctour he was afterward wrongfully suspect eue~ as we see now adays hys gospell euyll spoke~ vppo~ thorow the slaunderouse behaueoure wykked demeanoure of the~, whom in contempt of good pe+ople ye call eua~gelyke cryste~ brothern auauncing them sel+fys to be onely the trewe folowers obseruers of Crystes gospell where as theyr liuing manyfestely repugneth.
So yt after my iudgemente the chefe captayns of them may be lyke+ned to Theudas Iudas:
whych vnder a colour of comyng the very sauiour and redemer from all bo~dage whose wrongfully vsur+pyng by false promyses of much people of the Iewes for to folow the~, to theyr vtter vndoyng and fy+nall destruccyon.
N. These sedycyouse persons to applye vnto Martyn Luther and his folowers is bothe agaynste ye trothe witnes of your owne conscie~ce yf ye duely examyne yt.
For it is playne that thys Theudas Iudas, of a presumptyous affeccyon and quyetnes of mynde wythoute auctoryte of goddys worde or preferrement of hys honoure, sedycyously moued the people to folow the~ not god: where as Martyn Luther with such other euangelyke prechers, auaunce not presumptuousely them selfes but god onely nor+ther perswade the people to fo+lowe them but Criste: whose gospell longe season obscured by mennys tradycyons, they labour to bryng vnto lyght to restore the captyued consey+encys of ignorante folke vnto the fredome of goddes word whereof myche people nowe a dayes are nolesse desyrous than the Iewes were of theyr delyueraunce of bodely capty+uyte.
To answere you in thys poynt, dout nothing but thys Teudas and Iudas pretendyd to the peple (whom they fynally dysceuyd) ye auctoryte of god and yt they were specyally sent of him for theyr deliuerau~ce shewing some co+loured appare~ce vnto ye same: Lyke as Martyn Luther in ye begynnyng pretended a meruelouse zele tender affeccion towarde the blynde ignorau~ce of people for to reduce theym vnto ye clerenes of knowlege shewyng such a serue spyryt, that he was iugged to be syn+gulerly chosen of god nowe in these latter days, for a dew reformacion of the hole worlde.
But consyder to what open myschefe hys secrete malygny+te brast forthe at last and how many thousandys by occasyo~ of hys doctrine haue peryshed dayly peryshe bothe in body and sowle: whereof to haue a forther declaracyon yf ye wyll here me wyth pacye~ce shall so describe vnto you ye fassyon of hym and of hys adhere~tys, that ye may euyde~tly know yt they ar no dyscyples of Cryste but of Antycryste, no trewe doctours but fals dysceyuers no apostles but apostatas and patrons of peruersyte.
Now beseche you the~ to pro+cede on youre purpose, declaryng it at length: and shall gladly gyue you the herynge without interrupcyon trustig verely that all parcyalyte set a parte, ye wyll shewe the very trothe accordynge as ye haue perfitely known by experye~ce.
And thus doyng ye may setle many mennis hartis at rest in this troublous season so sore encombred wyth conte~cyons and sondry oppynyons of ler+ned men that they ca~ not tell what party they maye beste lene vnto. →W. Syr furst of all protest here, yt entende to speake no forther than haue perceyued among them my selfe or els perfytely by credable persons, of whose certifycacio~ ought to haue no mystrust. wherfore for to go vnto my purpose, ye shall vnderstande that this Martyne Luther cheefe captayn of new heretykes, brin+ger forth of old heresies was a frere augustyne in the cite of wyttenberge, vnder ye domini+on of Frederyke duke of Sax+ony. which duke opteyned a perdon from Rome for the byldi~g of a certayne college there within his own pallace, wher+of Martyn Luther was a gre+at setter forwarde vntyll the tyme that thyder came a Iubelye from the pope, dysanullyng the dukes perdon amo~g other for a season: wherwith Martyn Luther not a lytle of+fended, endeuoured hym selfe to preche agaynst it.
And sone after he putt forthe in prynt a treatyse De indulgentiis, inueyng agaynst the graunt of {per}dons: how be it so closely, yt he was supposed not to haue condem+ned the auctoryte but onely ye abuse whych to say the trothe was to farre owt of frame in ye prouynce.
And also he tooke in hand to preche ye playn tex+tes of scrypture dysclosynge the blyndenes of the worlde detectyng ye fautys of all estates bothe hyghe lowe, spyrytuall and temporall vnder suche moderacyon yt he was taken for a prophete of god amonge them grewe in estymacyo~ of ye peple dayly more and more.
Not wythsta~dynge he pretendyd to take no parte wyth any secte other faccyon of heretikes, as wicklyf, Hus, Berengarius, suche other whom he vtterly co~demnyd dyssalowing the Boemes be+cause they se{per}atyd the~ selftys frome the churche of Rome co~stantly affermyng the pope to be Crystys vycarye.
Thus he playd ye woolfe in a la~bys skynne a while secretly tyl his frutes gaue euyde~ce openly bewraid what he was in effect For shortely after he alteryd his mynde reuokyd yt he had spoken before wysshe~g all his bookys that were empryntyd to be burnyd vtterly destroyd.
Then begane he stowtly to fortefy his feyned fayth voyde of good workys perswadyng lybertye and assurau~ce of saluacyo~ to ye defacynge of charytable dedes and suppressyo~ of ye drede of god.
Then preched he pleasante thyngys to hys audyence howe no man was bownde to confesse hym vn to a prest to obserue ye prescryppcyon of prelates abowt fastyngys of meete and drynke and that no perso~ nedyd to payne him self with workes of satysfaccyon whyles Cryste had payed ynowgh for vs all Also how co~stytucyo~es of Popes bysshoppys bynde vs nothynge.
Then all hys sermones were agaynste ye cleargye callynge ye Pope Antychryste, hys folowers dyscyples of Satha~s synagoge in whose defyance he made a booke intytled de ptuntate Babisonica, full of conuycyous furyes and ragynge blasphemy agaynst the blyssed sacramentes preferrynge hys owne iugeme~t aboue the holy doctoures of the churche.
And where as he had wytnessyde before that wicklyfe, Hus, Be rengarius, suche other were heretikes: than he sayde that they were godly men and sain+tes callynge theyr conde~pners Antecrystes and lymmes of ye deuyll.
Furthermore to bryng kynges pryncyes temporall gouernours in contempte of their subgettes: he spared nother by prechyng ne techynge to rayle agaynst the~ somtyme preuely where he durst not dis+couer hys malyce for feare of dyspleasure and somtyme apertely there as he thought hym selfe in no daunger of the~ on whom he rayled: as wytnesse the letters of co~spyracye whyche he craftely forged to destroye the duke George of Saxonye.
*******************STAR CRXN TILL END************** Also the outragyous treatyse that he wrote agaynst the kyn+ges hyghenes both in latyn duch so shameles and sedycyously, that it is not onely condemned of good men but also abhorred of hys owne adhere~+tes. yet all thys whyle he for bare the comons vplandysh people and encouraged them to note other mennes vyces ra+ther than to amend theyr own fawtes alleggyng ofte~ tymes vnto them, tyrany of prynces, oppressyo~ of the clergye, wyth other manyfold myseries and wretched calamyties, whyche he sayde they were wro~gfully compelled suffer.
whereby wythin smalle {pro}cesse of tyme they toke such a stomake that drede of god and man sett a syde, they arose vppe wyth open sedycyone in dyuers pat+tyes of Germanye aboue the nombere of an hundred thousande persons in suche a furi+ous fasshyon, that euery man all moste stoode in feare of his lyfe. wherfore M. Luther per+ceyuynge no small ieoperdye toward hi~ through theyr insur+reccyon because the occasyon of yt was layde to his charge as yt was in dede: immediatly to shyft hym selfe from suspicion and dau~gerous displeasure of ye prynces great men he wrote hastely a boke voyde of all Christe~ charyte and naturall compassion, against the sayde comones or vplandyshe people so extremely yt it wold abhorre an hethe~ harte to here or rede yt enforcynge euery man wythoute any respecte of pyte, to kyll and slee theym as houndes: of whom were myserably slayne in one place and a nother, aboue .iii. score thou sande {per}sones ye resydue beyng now a lyfe in farre greater my+sery calamyte than euer they were afore.
After thys fell a dissencyo~ betwene M. Luther and Carolstadius aboute the sacramente of the altare.
For Carolstadius denyeth in it the bodely presence of Christe af+fyrmynge that when he spack thes wordes: Hoc est corpus meum, he meant the~ of his owne corporall bodye and not of the sa+crame~t: where as M. Luther holdeth the contrarye all beyt he beganne to fall from yt as his owne wrytynge testifieth, had he not ben by this Carolstadius whom the wyc+ked arrogau~cy of his stomake could not suffer to be auctour of so hye an heresie, wherof he couetyd hym selfe to haue ben father.
This variaunce endu+rynge betwyxe them: dyuers forsoke M. Luther leanyd to Carolstadius syde many malicious letters fraudule~tly forged were conueyde frome the one to the other wyth calu~+nyous prechynges ye when they met to gether, more redy wyth fystes than wyth pacye~t argume~tes to trye theyr cause had they not bene sonderyd.
Not wythstange through fa+uour of the duke and other va+lyau~te frendes M. Luther so agaynste hym that he was excomunycate: beynge a man of auncyent age, an old preste newly maried, and some tyme archedeaken of wytten berge was fayne to leue hys younge wyfe and auoyde the domynyon of Saxony.
After ye he had wandred thourough dyuers cities and townes swa+dynge hys opynyon wyth odious reporte to ye mynysshyng of M. Luthers fame: at laste he ca~ to Scyrich in Swytzerlande where he founde one ac+cordynge to hys execrable ap+petyte, named Swynglyus, whych was there an excedyng setter forth of M. Luthers do+ctrine.
To who~ as sone as he had disclosed his detcstable he+resye agaynst the blessed sacra+ment, he gladly accepted him and in denyenge the corporall presence of Cryst, agreed both in one sauynge in this poynte they dyffered: where as Carol stadius sayd that our saueour Christe spekyng thes wordes: hoc est corpus meu~, meaned his cor+porall presence there syttynge with his dysciples at the table not in forme of brede: Swin+glius affyrmed that they were not to be vnderstandyd lytterally, but by a figure of inter+pretacyon so that est was take~ for significat: and thes wordes of Chryste, this is my bodye were as myche to saye, as this sygnyfyeth my body.
Of thys mater he wrot sondry epistles to dyuers of his familyar fren+des, gloryously reioycynge yt he had founde oute the longe vnknowen trothe of so hygh a mysterye: not by the occasyon of Carolstadius (as he bosted) but through his own dily+gent redynge of scripture, and specyally of saynt Augustyns workes who in very dede ys clene contrary to his horryble heresye.
Neuertheles many of M. Luthers adherentes assen+tyd vnto hym amonge whom the chefe was Oecola~padius: whych beynge a seculer preste of .xl. yeres of age, entred ye reli+gyon of saynt Brydgyttes or+der in ye prouince of Bauarye and for heresyes that he hadde vttred both by prechynge and wrytyng, sta~dyng in daunger of the Dukes attachiament he ranne awaye pryuely wyth a nonne of the place who~ sone after he forsoke, and gathym for refuge to a Lutheran prin+ce named Fraunces de Sychken, a noble personage by byr+the, but a cruell tyraunte of be+haueour, a great murtherer, a comune spoyler of marchau~ts and a rouere of hygh wayes whiche mayntenyd hym and one Hutten a knyghte of the new gospell, gyue~ holly to mis+chefe till at the lest for feare of displeasure of other princes he was dryuen to put the~ awaye.
Oecolampadius cam then to Basyle there he founde many fauourers of M. Luthers faccyo~: by whose ayde he was promotyd to be curate of a pa+ryshe chyrche. where he handled hys matters wyth such clo+kyd hypocrisye, that he many mennes hartes craftely so wenge sedicious disturbau~s the temporalte the spiritualtye in such wyse that the hole cite was often tymes in parell of insurreccyon and in daunger to be destroyed.
But though he approuyd the oppynyo~ Swynglius with preferrement aboue Carolsta+dius: yet co~ceyued he another pryuate vnderstandyng sayenge yt est corpus meu~, thus to be interpreted: this is a fygure or a representacyon of my body allegynge Tertul+ane, Chrisostome saynt Au+sten for hys authorite, whom he vnderstandyth a mysse and recyteth falsly somtyme addyng more to theyr wordes, somtyme takynge awaye fro~ theyr sente~cyes.
In this space Martyn Luther wrote a conuycyous boke agaynst Carolstadius and he an answere to the same of lyke spyryte and semblable charyte so yt Swin+glius and his co~pany whyles other men wondred at theyr madnes, laughed them bothe to scorne.
Earolstadius percey+uynge yt he was not so hyghly estemyd as he reckened to haue bene also longynge very sore for the companye of hys yonge wyfe: at laste he made meanes to be reco~cyled agayn to Martyn Luther and hys churche, whiche was grau~tyd hym vpon condycyon that he shulde reuoke his opynyon of ye sacrame~t wherto he agreed albeit he helde not longe to wche with them.
But as sone as he had recoueryd his wyfe again, he gat him owt of ye way in to a vilage there kept a co+mune tauerne besely vttryng his olde heresyes, and daylye contryuynge newe.
Thus in Germany moch vnquyetnesse encreasyd and trouble out of measure with intollerable va+ryau~ce bytwene seculer people and the clergye: many dyffamous lybellys slaunderous wrytynges euery where dysperpled abrode.
And where as was but one faccion before, onely of the Lutheranes: than spra~g there vp another which be callyd Oecola~padianes or Swynglyanes owte of who~ yssued also ye thyrde faccyo~ namyd Anabaptystes, co~teyning aboue .xl. sectes of dyuers heresyes and sondery opynyons N.
In good fayth ye tell here a shrewde tale by theym.
And yf it be trewe as ye reher+se lyke their maners a grete deale worse than dyd.
But specially merueyle that they be deuyded in to so many fac+cyons sondery sectes seynge they pretende to professe the onely doctryne of Cryste, whiche noryssheth no suche co~tencyous dyuersyte: for he is the god of peace not of dyssencio~ →W. ensure yow ther be in Germany .iii.C. sectes aboue ye nomber that haue namyd, of whose varyable opynyons cowlde partely make rehersall yf had conuenyent opor+tunyte.
Now praye yow for the satysfyenge of my co~scyence and of dyuers other whyche perauenture haue ben dyscceyued and brought to errours, by the fayned report of the~, whiche wolde dylate theyr heresyes vndernethe the conlour of vertuous lyuynge, bol+dely affyrmyng in reproche of our catholike byleue yt among them is perfyte peace, co~cord, true loue charyte, freely admynystred to euery one in necessyte withoute respect of per+sons.
But fyrste wolde yt ye declared somwhat of the .iii. pri~cypall faccyo~s.
The fyrste as haue shewed you are callyd Lutheranes, bycau+se they folowe Luthers doctry+ne.
The seconde lyke wyse are callyd Oecolampadyanes or Swynglyanes are as one with the Lutheranes in raylynge agaynst the cleargye, in co~tempnyng the authoryte of the chyrche, but in the sacra+ment of the aultar they be gre+tely repugnaunt: and so farre at varyaunce that they haue made large volumes full of owtragious furies one agai~st another in such vncharytable maner that it excedith the blas+phemous contencyons of all heretykes and infideles that euer were before our dayes. ye theyr hatefull enemyte is so malycyous, that yf any of the Oecolampadyanes resorte amonge the Lutheranes: they shalbe exco~munycatyd as hethen persones, and fynde very small charyte, whiche they call loue after the newe interpreta+cyon.
And in lyke maner ye Lu+theranes shall fynde as lytle fauour amonge the Oecolam+padyanes.
The thyrde faccyo~ be callyd Anabaptistes, becau+se they are twyes chrystened wyll admytte as theyr faythfull brothere~ except they be rebaptyzed agayne.
They suffre not theyr chyldren to be chrystened vntyll they be of greate age and haue many straunge opynyons.
They affyrme that it is impossyble for kynges, prynces, iustices, and other gouernours of ye comon weale, to be chryste~ men.
They obstynatly hold that yt is vnlawfull for a iudge to requyre any othe of a cryste~ ma~.
They saye that chrysten men ought to make no prouysyon nor resistence agayns theyr enemies but frely suffre the~ to do theyr wyll.
Also they shew holye per+feccion outwardly obseruing vigyles, fastynges, wyth contynuall redynge of scrypture, redye to helpe theyr nedy brotheren, vsyng theyr goodes in comoue.
And they disprayse mych the lyuyng of the Luthe+ranes Oecolampadya~s say+enge as haue hard them my self reporte, that they be wors than the clergye whom they call Papistes, for because they haue the gospell in theyr mou+thes and frame theyr lyues no thynge thereafter shewynge none ame~dment of theyr lewd conuersacyo~, but co~tynue styll in vycyous excessys after the comone rate of mysbeleuers.
And therefore they be in greuous hatred and suffre moche persecucyon of the other as ex+communycacyon, exyle, enpry+sonement, oftentymes cruell execucyo~ of death: in so moche that it is enacted throwgh out Suytzerland among ye Oecolampadyaes, and in dyuers other places that who so euer is found of the Anabaptystes faccyon he shall be throwen quycke in to the water there drownyd.
se well tha~ sayenge and doeng are not all one.
For am enformed that Martyn Luther hath wryten extremely agaynst the persecu+cyon of prelates affyrmynge yt to be agaynst the spyryte of god to persecute or to putte to death for vnbelefe or errours consyderyng that fayth (as he doth saye) is a gyfte of god no man maye haue yt of hym selfe.
Also because Christe neuer compellyd any man to beleue in hym, co~mau~dynge the wedes to be suffered amonge the corne vntyll the heruest co~+myth.
→W. No fayle he wrote so at the beginnyng but after+warde experie~ce tawght hym the contrarye.
For if so be that he ye Oecolampadyanes had permittyd theyr clyentes to do what they lusted wythout any restraynte: they had ben quite oute of auctorite ere this tyme a daye. whych considera+cyon yt was forfendyd in all cyties and iurisdyccyones of ye Lutheranes that no ma~ shuld bye or sell other resceyue, any booke or treatise compyled by the Oecolampadyanes.
And they in lyke maner made actes to suppresse ye Anabaptystes fearyng left theyr sectes shuld vaynquesshe theyre faccyon.
N. yf ye Anabaptystes haue so many sectes as ye recyte, praye yowe to declare some of them.
There be some whych hold opynyon that all deuylles da~nyd sowles shall be sauyd at the daye of dome.
Some of them persuade that the serpent whyche dysceyued Eue was Christ.
Some of the~ zraunt to euery man and woman two soules.
Some affyrme lecherye to be no synne, ye one maye vse a nother ma~nes wyfe withoute offence.
Some take apon them to be sooth sayers and prophetes of wo~der+full thynges to come haue prophecyed the daye of iudge+ment to be at ha~de: some with in thre monethes, some wyth in one moneth, some wythin vi. dayes.
Some of the~ bothe men and women at theyre con+gregacyones for a mysterye shew them selfes naked, affyr+myng that they be in the state of innocencye.
Also some hold that no ma~ ought to be punys+shed or suffere execucyon for any cryme or trespace be yt ne+uer so horryble, wherof will shew yow an exa~ple done ma+ter in dede.
In Switzerland a lytle fro~ saynt Gall at a place namyd Cella Abbatis; one of these anabaptystes slew hys owne brother smote of his heade. when he was demau~dyd why he dyd so, this was hys answer: It was the wyll of the father that shuld do yt and so he escaped wythout punys+shement.
For though they be gredy i~reproui~g other me~nes fawtes makynge haynous ex+clamacyones agaynst the~: yet ponder they full lytle the correccyon of theyr owne enormi+tyes callynge them infyrmyteis and weaknes of ye flesshe be they neuer so abhomynable N. well yet me thynketh by your sayenge here before, that many of them leade a more co~+me~dable life in face of ye world than the comone sorte of ye Lu+theranes or Oecola~padianes, →W. ye verely vnto the outwarde ostentacyon.
But there co~meth greater incouenyence by theym whych haue suche a shadowe of holy lyuyng, than by the other.
And there is nothyng more peryllous in sedu+cynge the symple than a payn+tyd pretence of an holye lyfe where as they swerue ones fro~ the ryght fayth and catholyke belefe. whyche ys easye to be proued by euydent examples as well of the olde heretykes, as of oure newe captaynes of the moste hye heresyes.
And to shew you the truth as haue expertely fou~de, some haue knowen so angelyke of co~uer+sacyon, yt coude haue in my harte to commytte my soule holly in to theyr direccy+on: whom afterward haue perfytely perceyued to be auc+tours of suche detestable here+syes /that it wold make a criste~ harte to tremble for to here the~+onis namyd.
And to tel you of one amonge many was aquaynted wyth a certeyn persone of the Oecolampadyans in ye cytie of Argentyne, which led a lyfe inculpable amonge hys neyghbours, was repu+ted of vertuous conuersacyon exercysynge hym selfe contynually in charytable workes, and vnderstode fresshly ye scry+ptures in his mother tounge, for he was ignoran~t of latine.
Afterwarde he fell in to so abhominable heresye that he de+nyed openly the new testame~t, sayenge yt Chryste was a fals prophete, and all his apostles dysceuers, acceptyng no parte of the olde testament but the v. bookes of Moyses.
The chefe prechers and lerned me~ of the cyte cam vnto hym for to reforme hym by waye of disputacyon, and to brynge hym from his errour requyrynge hym to shew what grounde of scrypture or what occasyo~ mo+ued hym to take so peryllous
To whom he coldly wyth soft wordes countenaunce, how he wolde nother dyspute nor argue wyth them, sayenge that was his belefe was assurid of god with witnesse of his con+scyence to be trewe.
Apon this inco~tyne~te he was enprysoned and at last brought before the lordes of the towne whiche in lyke maner exhorted hym to reuoke his heresyes manacynge hym with feare of terryble deth yf he wolde not chau~+ge hys erronyous mynde.
He answered that he was redy to suffre what so euer deth god had ordeyned hym vnto, and wolde nother for feare nor for fauour go from his opynyon. wherfore after a suffycyent de+lyberacyon seynge he wolde tourne by no meanes sentens was gyuen that he shulde be burnyd.
In good fayth well worthy: but was he burnyd in dede? →W. No.
For when he shulde haue gone to the place of execucyon accordynge to the vsaunce of the countrye he was fyrst brought before the towne howse and there hys artycles recyted.
He was asked whether they were the very same which he hadde affermyd before them.
Howbeit nowe (he sayd) god hath openyd my ignoraunce, aknowlege me slaunderously to haue erryd askynge yow all forgyuenes.
byleue perfytely that Iesus Chryst is my sauyour, and am redy in his fayth to suffre this deth prepared for me.
The lor+des then where as they had gy+uen sentence that he shoulde ha+ue ben burnid for a more they assyned hym to be wherof he thanked the~, and went toward the place of iustyce pacyently takyng hys deth with great repentaunce.
N. Thys may be a good ad+monyssheme~t that men shulde not be so wauerynge in fayth as to gyue credence in all thin+ges to any persone for ye onely prete~ce of exteryoure holines, in as moche as the deuyll can transfygure hym selfe in to an angels likenes, and a fals per+uerter take vppon hym ye offy+ce of a trewe apostle.
Moreouer consyder by your co~munycacyon and playne experyence here rehersyd that yf the froward sturdynes of vnruly people were not restreyned by lawes, prohybycyo~s, sharpe euery comone weale wolde be soone subuertyd, and the hole world come to nought.
→W. As for that ye may take example natferre+hens at ye countye of Emdone in east Fryse lande where the erle ruler of the county fyrstle resceyuyng Martyn Luthers doctryne, afterwarde Oecolampadins opynyon: suffryd his peple to rede all maner of bookes, and to be of what so+euer secte or opynyo~ they wolde without any restreynte.
Shortely after one of theyr chefe preachers whiche hadde bene a freer obserua~te, a man of subtyle lernynge and pleasaunte speche, hyghly estemyd amonge the people: began to preache in open audyence against the blyssed trynyte sayenge that there was but one persone, one god, that our sauyoure Chryst was a creature as we are, a pure man, not god but hauynge goddes spyryte.
This caused not a lyt+tell dyscorde betwene the prechers and the peple for many of ye cou~trye leanyd vnto him, takynge hys parte so strongly that the erle was fayne to banysshe hym owte of hys domy+nyon, all beit hys pestyferous sede remayned The~ cam thyther doctor Baltazar, and after hym Carolstadi{us} bryngynge in the of ye Ana+baptistes to ye augmenting of greater co~fusyo~.
For where as some crystenyd theyr chyldre~, theyr next neyghbours wolde not one condemnyng another with dedly hatred.
The meane season a certeyne skynner of Denmarcke in the dukdome of Holsacye, where Martyn Luthers doctryne was onely in strength prechyd Oecolam+padius opynyo~ with so crafty argumentes, that Martynes faine began to decreace. wher+fore doctour Pomerane was sent from wyttenberge to dyspute agaynst hym and in con+clusyon obtayned the vyctory through parcyall fauoure (as some reportyd) of ye duke and lordes of the cyteys of Homburgh and Breame: whiche immedyatly co~maundyd that no man shulde be so hardye to contrarye or swerue from the doctryne of Martyn Luther, vnder payne of banysshynge and other
The~ two prechers of Breame were sent to Emdone to dyswade ye erle hys people from Oecolampadius opynyon, and fro~ the confuse dyuersyte of other sectes also to reduce theym agayne vnto Martyn Luthers wayes.
The erle with hys cou~+cell at ther perswasyons alyenatyd theyr myndes fro~ Oeco+lampadi{us} streytely chargyng all those prechers whiche had susteynyd his faccyon, or any other sauynge Martyn Luthers to departe owt of hys countrye by a certeyne daye apoynted.
Then was it a won+der to se what murmuracyon, grudge, and rumour of sedycyon was amonge the people not without lykelyhed of fallynge togyther by the eares insurreccyon agaynste theyr prynce, had not he sought pro+uyde~t meanes to pacyfye the~.
Thys co~tynued no lo~ge space but letters came from Argentyne, Basyle, zyricke, Bearne, and from many persons of no+table erudycyon after theyr estemyng, also from the prynce of Hesse aduertysynge ye erle with seryous exhortacyon, to calle home agayne ye prechers of Oecolampadius faccyon reprehendyng hys sodayn mu+tabylyte from theyr institute, so apparent by manyfest coniectures to preuayle aboue ye other.
At whose importune re+questes and subtyle instygacy+ons, he chaunged yet agayne hys purpose, and gaue the Oe+colampadyane prechers lyce~s to returne in to theyr olde places, and liberte to preache as they were before accustomed: co~maundyng sylence vnto the other or ellys auoydaunce of his countrye. thus may ye se what varyable inconstau~cy and sondrye mutacious of con+demnyd heresyes hath ensued with euydent confusyo~, where as people be dyuided from the vnyte of ye chrysten chyrche, contemne to walke after the holsome of catholyke fathers wrestynge the ryght sence of scryptures vnto theyr crooked ymaginacyons.
And specially where the brydle of sensualyte is sett at large to ye sturdye frowardnes of sedieyous subiectes, somtyme by ye te~dernes of princes so neglige~tly regardid yt after+ward theyr fearfull rygour is scantable to redresse it: which hath bene ye lamentable dekay of ye Boemes, and is now the ruynous myschefe of the hye Almaynes not vnlykely to be the desolacio~ of crystendome, yf remedy be not founde in sea+son.
N. Sauynge your pa+cyence me thought ye declared here yt the La~dgraue of Hesse is a fauourer of Swinglius Oecolampadius who wyth his people as vnderstande admytteth Martyne Luthers wayes and none other.
→W. will not denye but he mayn+teneth styll Martyn Luthers doctrine all be yt syns the dys+potacyon was before hym, he hath fauoured so greatly the opynyon of Oecolampadius and Swinglius, yt were it not as deme for feare of displea+synge hys confederate cosyne the duke of Saxony, and fren+tyke perturbacion of Martyn Luther he wolde haue sustay+ned yt openly ere this tyme. wytnesse the gloryous comen+dacyo~ vnto theyr faces whiles they were present and syngu+ler preferreme~t of the~ amonge hys famylyer cou~sellers also hys beneuolent lyberalyte at theyr departynge wyth letters afterward betwyxe the~ farsyd+full of paynted prayses i~ theyr absence.
beseche yow when and vnder what maner was this dysputacion.
the prince of Hesse in his chefe cyte of Marburge caused there to be asse~bled Martine Luther Melancton, Oecola~padi+us, Swynglius, Capito, But+zer wyth many other of ye most famous clerkes of the Luthe+ranes and Oecolampadyans (ye Anabaptystes onely excludyd) where dyuers artycles were doutfully proponyd to ye nomber of .xv. whyche before tyme had bene dyscussyd cle+relye determyned in generall counselles of the vnyuersall chyrch.
And when they had by longe vnfrutefully dys+puted aboute the iustifycacion of fayth without good of baptyme, and other questy+ons apon whych they had wry+ten hole bookes: yet in ye ende were they dryue~ to the olde de+terminacyo~ of the chyrch, saue theyre wrytynges shulde seme in vayne, theyr assemblynge to be ydle they founde out some contrariety of so slen+der importancye, that me~ may playnely iudge in them, other inuyncyble arrogance dysday+nynge to be reformed or elles obstynate malyce sekynge for the nonis of impugne ye troth. the sacrame~t of the altare wherin rested ye prin+cypall mater of theyre disputa+cyon they greatly varyed and coude by no meanes agree.
How beyt they concludyd atte+last, that eche parte holdynge them contente wyth theyre be lefe shuld departe in louynge frendshyppe, without any ody+ous writyng fro~ thence forthe one agaynste a nother.
But sone after theyr departyng, the Luthera+nes ascribed it to Martyn Lu+ther and contrarye the Oecolampadyanes vnto Oecolam+padyus and Swynglyus.

Also Butzer playd a lyke pageante wyth Pomerane in translati~g hys psalter out of latyne into the almayn tonge.
For where he aspyed any occasyo~ to treat of the blyssed sacramente: he plucked out Pomeranes se~te~ces, and graffed in hys own af+ter no compendyous fassyon: which as sone as they were en+prynted the fame noysed ouer all yt Pomerane (vnknowyng to hym) was one wyth the Oe+colampadeans whych afterwarde he apertely detestyd in dyuers epystles, dyscoueryng the falsehod of Butzer.
Such suttyll dryftes may tell you among them is dayly not vnpractysed.
N. well, ye haue here rehersed many thynges a+gaynst them wherin yf and such other wold gyue crede~ce vnto your saynges wythoute surmyse of we shuld sone turne our affeccyon from theyr lernyng.

More ouer beseche you wyth what crysten spyryte dyd Fraunces of Syckhym defe~d the~, a subuerter of peas, a bur+ner of poore mennes houses, a troubler of all Germany vp+pon whom the vengeaunce of god dyd lyghte, and was sodenly slayn in a castell besyde Crutzynacke to the infamy of hys au~ceters and disherytau~ce of hys chyldern.

And as for ydlenes sawe no manne more fawty in yt than them sel+fes: except ye account that for profytable bysynes when they be nother ydle nor well occupi+ed.
Are there not a great infy+nyte nomber amonge them, yt can say sharpely to other mennys chargys the co~mau~deme~t of god gyuen to Adam: In swete of thy face thou shalt ete thy brede dylygently repete ye laborous workyng of saynte Paule and other dyscyples of Cryste, whych lyue dylycately in ydlenes? And suppose ye yt a man may not fynde many of them whych haue theyr susten tacyon vppo~ the spoyle of chur+ches, robbery of monestaryes, and extorcyon of innocent peo+ple? N. Thoughe some of the~ be of such disposycion: yet ought not ye to condemne, the nomber of the good for a small some of the yuell →W. why do ye then dispyse the vni+uersall churche because some of them be nought· N. Ma+ry for because the more some of the yuell, surmountythe the lesse no~ber of the good.
And thynke yowe that yt may not be better verefyed among the new gospellers, of yt which the best ys stark nought? Not+wythstandynge some haue knowe~ of excellent lyterature, whych for theyr sober co~uersa+cyon and temperate lyuyng, if they hadde bene as seryous in furtherynge the fayth as they were in settyng forthe of heresies were worthy to be pillers of Crystes chyrch.
But ponder not so greatly the outward holynes of hypocrytes consyderyng that Arrius, us, Pellagius, other execrable heretykes euen as they equall wyth them in heresyes so were they not inferyours to them in such hypocrysy.
How many here in Englond wythin thys .C. yere haue rydde them selfys out of thys mortall lyfe wythe a desperate dethe hated both to god man some drow+nyng the~ selfys, some cuttyng theyr own throtes, and many hangyng them selfys whyche in theyr lyfe tyme haue bene re+puted for well dysposed, vertu+ous, charytable folke aboue the comon sorte of peo+ple peraduenture some here in Londo~ of oure olde aquayn+taunce.
In whom is fulfylled sayng of Samuell: marketh those thinges that open to the eye, but god conderyth the secretnes of ye to the verefyenge of Crystys worde in the gospell That whych is hyghly auaun+ced of men is abhominable in the syghte of god.
Neuerthe+lesse yf ye go to the vttermost: coud appoynt ye to many of the church, whych accomplysh the perfeccyo~ of lyuyng vnfay+nedly wherof these men afore sayd haue but a bareyn or a domb symylytude.
And as for the worst multytude of pre+stys, monkes, chanons, freers and other relygyous persons dare compare theym wythe the comon sorte generally of these new faccions all though ye put a part theyr fayth obe+dye~ce to ye church, whych no small mater.
N. So god help me then dare gyue ye verdyte wythout any quest, that they be stark noughte all the meyny of them.
And to be+ginne furst of all at the freers ye se what a rascall rable ronneth abowte the cuntrey wyth bosomed sermons, preachyng fables and olde wyues tales in stede of the worde of god whych ar redy matys to associ+ate vnthriftes in all myschefe, to the slaunder of crysten relygyon.
And to speke of mo~kes, chano~s, wyth other relygyous possessyoners praye yowe what a gostely lyfe leade they, geuen holly to ydle+nes and bely ioy in etynge and drynkyng, wythowte study of scrypture or endeuerme~nte of any vertnouse excercise.

Also seculer preestes eue~ as bad as the best, shall ye not fynde theym at tauernes dyshonest housys, drynkyng gowsyng tyll they be as dron+ken as apes nothing abashed to swere blasphemous othes to vse fylthy co~munycacyon.
And such as be curates haui~g charge of mennes sowles, are there not many of the~ blynder that betles destitute of necessa+ry doctrine with good lyuing, whereby theye myghte edyfye theyre parysshons.
It were to a processe to reherse theyr wrechydnes so farre of order whych all the worlde perceyueth speketh agaynst it, and yet can be none amende+ment.
If theyr wrecthid+nes of lyuyng as ye say be ma+nyfest to all the world: it shall not be so nedefull for yowe to declare any further therof as yt wyll be expedyente for me to tell of these new gospellers, whose erronyous wyckednes is knowen to very few here in this region.
And surely to im+proue the vniuersall churche as iuell, because many of them belewde: it were no lesse mad+nes than to sette at nought the olde testame~t, because ye more parte of the childern of Israell were euill other to dispise the gospell because all these newe faccio~s which falsely presume to be folowers of it, are hereti+kes.
Amo~g who~ ye shall fynde freers that haue cast of theyr habytes and forsakyn theyre relygyon, whyche haue maryed wyues and sone after scape away fro theym, leauing theym in carefull desolacyon ye some one maryeng .ii. or .iii. wyues in dyuers countreys, whome they haue dysceyuyde by craftye entycementys makyng theym beleue with theyr gorgeous apparayle that they co~e of noble ryche fre~des.
And of these are there many which walk ouer sondry {pro}uin+ces, with glosynge speche and swete tales spieng owt vnsta+ble people yt will be waueryng with euery winde and such theyr stomackes them to contemne fastynges and pray+ers, desyrous of carnall lyber+tie, and can rayle agaynste the clergy, caring for no and when suche vnlawfull menes fayll, giue them selfes to thefte, robbing of churches and sedycyous dysturbaunce whereby some of them are pro+moted to the galows shame+full marterdome of felons.
Lykewise apostata monkes peruerted vnto theyr fectes, some bring with the~ as much substaunce of the spoyle of theyre places, that they pur+chase therwith fayre landes yerely rentes.
Also preestes yt haue made cheuesau~ce of their benefices for .ii. or .iii.C. poun+des at whose comming it is worlde to here howe god ys mangnyfyede for theyr delynerance frome the tyranny (as they call yt) of Antycryste and what brotherly chere ys made with ferue~t reioyce i~ ye sustra~ce of Crystes crosse, namelye yf they haue store of monye.

Besyde these, howe many in Germany haue annuall of cyties and townes for tearme of lyfe, bownde to no maner of serues whose cha~ge of state is to no renuyng of spirituall conuersacio~, but rather an vnsacyat luste of fleshly fre+dome euyde~tly tryed by theyr vycyous behaueoure, ydle lyuynge, dysguysed apparayll.
N. ye maye speke many thynges for your plesure but ye knowe ryght well, ye crystyn relygyon standyth not in owtwarde raymente, nor ca~ not but as good a soull may be vnder a seculer wede, as in a relygyous vesture.
The stra~ge dyuersyte of habytes is not co~+mau~ded of god nother scrypture ascribeth any holynes vn+to the~.
In good fayth speke of truth not of plesure For it is to me mych dyspleasure to se the~ suche as se the~ not in theyr dysguysed clothi~g onely· full farre vnsemely for them, if they were eyther suche as they were before, or such as they now call theym selfe but ouer that in euery kynde of all dysordered lyuyng: whych ye let passe, as though had fou~den no faut but wyth theyr clo+thynge.
And agaynste that ye seme to set at nought the haby+tes and fassyons of religyouse people callyng them straunge dyuersytees thingis nought worth, because they be not co~maunded of god, nor that scry+pture ascrybeth no holynes in them.
But as for strangnes of apparell, relygyouse men vse none.
But theyr apparell was at the furst deuysed by such as they that now hate do not yet denye for holy blessed men.
And now they cannot be straunge, when they contynew styll euery order hys olde fassy+on, and that all ye worlde hath loked vppon them, and amo~g a thousand freers none go bet+ter appareled then an other.
But now vnto the tother syde, these that ro~ne away from the~ vnto these Lutherans they go say dysguysed strangely fro~ that theye were before, in gay cotes, and cut and scot+ched hosen, very syghtely forsothe, but yet not very semely for such folk as they were and shulde be.
And thys apparell change they dayly, from fassyo~ to fassio~ euery day worse than other their new fangled foly theyr wa~ton pryde neuer co~t nor
And where ye set at nought all strange diuer syte of habytes, in whyche ye meane wote well not onely religyouse mennes apparell but also the garmentys worne in diuyne seruyce, for therin knowe youre mynde of olde: say these gere were well ordered by good men, not with owt ye good helpe of god.
And ye can not fynde that they be dyssalowed of god, but rather approuyd in as moche as he in ye olde testament appoynted vnto ye prestes and mynysters a seuerall dystynccyo~ of apparayle frome the comone peple, specyally in theyr mynystracyo~s· Also yt appereth by ye story of ye prophete Heliseus, whom chyldren of Bethell and wondred· apon yt he was not clothyd after theyr comen fassyon.
And veryly holde it more co~uenye~t for relygyouse persons to were ye habytes by theyre fore fathers inytute than to be arayed after the ruf+fyan inuencyon of many gospellers in Germany.
All these ar but blynde reasons of your own fantasy, nothyng to the purpose.
The orygynall in ytucyon of relygyous habytes began vppon certayn consyderacyons.
As thus: when holy fathers lyued in wyldernes they made theyr garmentes after a fassyon that myght best defend the sharp stormes and yll wethers.
And some yt gaue them selfys to bodely labour, contryued theyr clothes to be shape~ in a most hansome maner to worke in.
Also some of them wyllyng to exchew superfluytye of vesture deuysed theym habytes moste apte for warmeth sparyng of clothe.
But now these consyderacyo~s faylyng: to were the habytes of them not to folowe theyr example, me thynketh yt mere hypocrysye
→W. Then may say to you agayne after the same forme of argumentacyo~.
The fyrst inuentours of thys new dysgysed apparayll, were hethen peple vnthryftes, fooles, and myslyuyng persons: now ye that be accou~ted good crysten people vse the same, where as ye oughte not folow theyr lewdenes therfore ye be &c. Notwythsta~ding demau~+ded ones of a certayn co~panio~ of these sectis whych had bene of a strayt relygyo~ before, why hys garmentys were nowe so sumptious, all to pou~ced with gardes and iaggys lyke a rutte of the launce knyghtys.
He answeryd to me that he dyd yt in co~tempte of hypocrysy. why quothe dothe nott god hate pride the mother of hypocrisy, as well as hypocrysy yt selfe? wherto he made no dyrect answer agayne but in excusyng hys fawt, he sayd yt god pryncypally accepted the mekenes of the hart and inward crysten maners whych beleue were so inward in hym, yt seledome he shewed any of the~ outward+ly.
But what say you to the proui+syon of pore people there, such as ar aged or impotent that beggers be not suffred to craue at me~nes doores, nor to loy+ter ydelly as they do here, but ar set a worke.
tell you some men thynk yf our sturdy monkes, chanons, freers, labored for theyr lyuyng as we lay people do yt it wolde be a meryer world tha~ now is.
→W. what a mery tyme it wold be here in thys land am vncertayne but am sure that in Germany among these new faccyo~s, ys yet but a sory world lyke to be worse.
ye say there be no loytryng and that is trew for few or none resorteth thydet becawse they can haue none almes nor relefe excepte they wyl do i~tollerable seruice for so slender wages yt yf they be not of sober dyet, and longe exercysed wyth laboure, it is not possyble for them to away with yt.
But what is theyr labour? mary pluckyng downe of chyrches and monasteryes, and buyldyng of bulwarkes wallys to instre~gth theyr to agaynst them which couet to reforme them.
And here is a dowt to be mouyd when such busynes is endyd, howe shall they be then set a worke, consy+derynge that in other occupacyons a fewer nomber than be all redy were able to suffyse yt peple so they fynde yt there all redy. N. God wyll prouyde otherwyse for them than mannes ymagynacyon can prehe~de.
But sythe yt is no pleasure to hym to se them leue the faythe and fall to heresies, pull down chyrches and bylde vpp bulwarkes agaynst god in defe~ce of theyr abomynable veryly thynk that the wrath of god wyll worke them vengeaunce, and sende suche men mych mysery, and abate theyr bulwarkes to the grounde as he abated the prowde tow of Babylon, when he co~founded the byelders in to as many to~ges as ye deuyll hath co~fou~ded ye bylders of these bulwarkes i~ to many sha~efull sectis.
And which of vs is begyled the ende shall shew.
But this here say that as yet hytherto, where as ye spake of theyre intollerable labour: a~ certefyed that they come from it as ioyously as it were from a recreacion.
→W. blame theym neuer a deale thoughe they be gladde when theyr taske is at an ende. N. Nay meane when theyr ha~des be full of blaynes and blysters, wyth achynge armes, theyr shulders black and blew by reason of heuy burthens: that then they reioyce in suffrau~ce.
They yt so haue certifyed you pray you wryte vnto the~ agayne, and praye them to certefye you also how many worketh wyth an euyll wyll for the onely lacke of lyuynge and howe many ronne fro theyr worke rather chuse to go stele be hanged to, rather the~ to come to so paynfull worcke agayne.
And by that tyme that they haue certyfyed you of these two sortys: they shall warant you certefye of the thyrde tother sorte that are so gladde of suche laboure not fully so many as ye reke~ now.
And yet thynke veryly that some suche are there to.
For haue knowen ere thys where me~ haue be~ sore hurt in frays yt they whych haue bene sorest wounded haue most reioyced not in hys harmes but in the praysyngs of other.
N. who be they yt shuld prayse so these labourynge folke.
→W. Euen suche of theyr owne sectys as will not labour the~ selfes whi+che ar redyer to e~corage other me~ vnto suffraunce of deth for theyre opynyons, than to ieoparde them self the leste of theyr ere.
But now to your obieccyo~ that ye wold prestys, monkys, and freers shulde labour as other temporall men do: holde it expedyent that many of them shulde be better occupyed than they are.
Howe be it haue hard in Germany complayntes murmuracions of hande crafty me~ and artyfycers agaynste relygyous persons whyche haue made them selfes worldly, and lerned theyr occupacyons.
For through theyr augmentacyo~ the proffytable gaynes of occupacyons was mynysshed and the welth of theyr lyuynge decayde, so that many were compellyd to seke aduentures in straunge prouincys for defaut of worke at home.
Also haue knowen in the cyte of Colen in other placys of the low con+trey that relygyous persones in theyr cloysters fyndyng the~ selfes with labour of theyr ha~des, as spynnyng, weyuyng, makyng of lynnen cloth haue bene vpo~ to the lordes and rulers yt they toke away the auauntage and lyuynge from the pore como~s cytezens: wherfore they haue bene restrayned from takynge of temporall peoples worke.
N. By thys rekenynge seldome ys a chau~ge for ye better.
But yet howe faye ye to theyre prouysyon for poore impotent peple? →W. After my mynde they neuer went about an acte that pretendyde a more godly purpose or a feruenter zele of charytable co~passyo~. whych ordynau~ce yf yt had a {pro}gresse of co~tynuaunce as yt had a lykelyhode at the begynnynge: were to be alowed and practysed of all crysten nacyons.
But euery occasion wysely po~+deryd wyth dew cyrcu~stau~ces it wyll make those yt be sage to stay at yt other lyke maters takyng auysement before, lest they e~terpryse further the~ they be able to bryng vnto a lawda+ble ende.
It is ye very properte of como~ peple, namely of these Almayns that, what, so euer they be perswaded vnto, agre+able to theyr affeccyons they shall be redy in a sodeyn gyere to accomplysh: regardyng no+ther damage ne commodyte, though sone after they repent theym.
And lyke as the people of Israhell brought the iewel+lys of theyr wyues chyldern to the makynge of the golden calfe: so dyd they bryng theyr iewellys, bedys, rynges, owtches, wyth mony both golde syluer, to the comon hutches so haboundantly for thys pro+uysyon ye men dowted in some place whyther they had poore folk suffycyent to consume so excedynge heapys of ryches.
But this dout was sone made a playn case: for withi~ a whyle after the ardente heat of theyr lyberall waxyd cold.
And because they contynued not styll in bryngynge in theyr oblacyons: the hutches and coffers were emptye ere men wyst yt.
Then whyles yt was compassyd what way myghte be best taken for the preseruacyon of thys ordynaunce, least yt shuld decaye, to theyr confu+fyon that began yt: some gaue counsell that yt shulde be necessary to depryue the clergye of theyr goodes, and to dystry+bute theyr possessions, landes, and rentys amonge lay peple.
And to throwe downe all monasteries churches makyng coyne of crosses, chalessys and other sacred iewels, for ye suste~+cyon of the poore as they allegyd.
Thys aduyse with assent of certayne prynces and comonteys was approuyd affyrmynge that yf so infynyte ryches were onys in theyr han+dys the reuenewes of great men shuld be so enlargyd, that they shulde nede to rayse no taxys nor lones of the commons but rather cease frome all importable exaccyons.
In lyke maner by the same po+lycy comons might grow vnto such welthy substaunce: that beggers and nedy people fewe or none shulde be founde among them, whych ought to be called a golden worlde or a tyme of felycyte.
And ca~ it not so to passe in conclusyo~? →W. No, nor neuer shall make you assuraunce, for the goodes ar wasted no ma~ can tell how: ye at thys houre the prynces and lordes of ye cyties hungry to pyll pole then euer they were.
The com+mons also in lesse welth, endu+ryng more greuous oppressyo~ then euer they dyd, wythe no fewer myserable persons then they had before all thinges as out of mesure scarce eche com+playnynge to other of theyr ca+lamyties infortunate without remedy of redresse or hope of a of a chau~ge.
N. Our lord forbede yt yt shuld chau~ce so →W. yet lacke there in Englond that wysh full hartely after suche a ruffelyng chaunge the more parte suche as hope to wyn and haue nothynge to lese and yet some so mad that haue of theyr owne, and why the happely myghte pe~t it fyrst of all.

But thys dare be bolde to saye that the contreys where they stode fynde suche lacke of them: that they wolde he had let them sta~de.
And thynk you then that there wold be no lak founden yf ye remanaunt were so serued to? wene men wold so sore mysse them that many which speke, agaynst the~ wold sone labour hys owne handys to set them vp agayne.
In good faythe your wordes make me so amasyd, that ca~+not tell what may say to the mater: se the lyuynge of the clergye is farre wyde from the doctrine of Cryst example of thappostles ye Lutheranes by your saynge be i~ wors case both destitute of catholik faith good crysten maners, wythout any better lykelyhode excepte by the meanes of a gene+rall reformacyon.
→W. who shuld be the auctours of thys reformacyon? N.
→W. put case that many of them be as wyde owte of the ryghte waye as the other.
N. That can ye tell partely concernyng thys popes holynesse for ye were lately at Rome.
In very dede herde pyteous+ly of yt by other me~nes report, but sawe yt not: saw the lesse because taryed so lytell whyle there.
Natwythsta~dyng yt fortuned me to talke wyth an Italyan and in our communycacion spake as had hard, that the pope and the emperour entendyd a reformacyon. whye sayd he they haue begon all redye.
Se ye not quod he that they haue destro+yed Lombardye, Italye, Naples, also enpouered Frau~ce, to the ruynous decay of cryste~+dome? Beware sayde what ye speke. yes quod he for meane no dyshonoure to theyr hyghnes for they perfourme the wyll and commaundeme~t of god as they of Syrya and Babylone dyd in destroyng ye euyll chylderen of Israhell, to thentent the good myght pros+pere in theyr placys.
Mary Qd that ys clene contrary here for the good be destroyed and the euyll are encreased so that neuer in Italye were sene so many vagaboundes, theues, hores, and harlottys, as are in thys present tyme. well sayde he yf ye good be rather destroyed as ye allege, and the euyll are styll reseruyd: yt ys a toke~ that they haue escaped wyth an easy scorge the dredefull ve~+geaunce of god, whych remay+neth for these ye be left behynd.
Howbeyt rede in storyes of the byble, that ye synfull world was first destroyed before that ryghteous, Noe, was possess of ye frutefull yerth, blyed of god and the abomynable cyteys of Sodome Gomor vterly subuertyd ere vertuous Lothe ascendyd the mount of hys refuge.
Also the reprobate people of Israhell were holly extyncte ere euer theyre elect chyldren entryd the lande of promys. wherfore construe ye as ye please, feare me that the reformacyon of the worlde shall be wyth the sworde of ve~+geaunce vppon the people for theyr iniquyte consyderyng ye obduracyon of theyr hartys, harde neckyd stubburnes not mouyd at the wo~derfull toke~s whych dayly pronostycate the wrathe of god to be at hande. wyth thys he shranke awaye wolde tarye no longer.
N. Peraduentur he was afrayde to wade further in the trothe.
But beleue me yf ye wyl wher he spake of the destroynge of euyll people: wene yf Luthe+ranys be such as ye make the~, yt were the redyest waye for a reformacyon to kyll vp theym quyte.
→W. wolde rather wyshe them ame~dyd yf yt may be.
And as for kyllynge theym in some place yt were no great maistry.
But the~ in some other placys where wold ye fynde ye people to do the execucyon? N. we shuld lacke none in Englande warant yow for there be many of the clargye that wolde be full glad of yt, marchauntys some, thoughe many be on theyr syde.
Also ye myght haue a great sorte of ye co~mons, and many courtyers, though some of euery sorte fauoure Luthers wayes some great mennys seruau~tys bere men in hande that theyr souereyns support such maters spe+cially in tauerns, marchau~tes howses, other placys where they make the~ selues no small fooles when wyse me~ be forth a dores.
For ye vnderstande not what ye saye. N. Howe so? →W.
For yf we wyll put awaye all Lutheranes and all suche open heresyes, we must fyrst putte awaye many other synnys whyche haue brought those heresyes in.
For trow ye that heresyes the moost terry+ble plage of god cometh not through synne of the peple pro+uokynge hys ire and indygna+cyon whereby he sendyth amonge them false prophetes erronyous teachers, prechyng maters accordynge to theyre waywarde appetytes.
N. yet prestys and clarkys are ye bryngers vp of heresyes and ye chefe maynteyners of them, by occasyon of popes, cardynalles, bysshops, other prelatys of the clergye.
→W. wyll neyther excuse nor accuse neyther them nor other.
But fere me yt as for other synnes the clargie and the lay to shall not nede to stryue therfore but maye well agre togyther and parte the stake betwene them.
And as for heresyes, thoughe some of the clergye comenly be+gynne them: yet yf we loke on olde cronycles wyth experye~ce of our own tyme, we shall well fynde that there hathe not lckked some great temporal pryn+cys, nor a great no~ber of lewd laye people to set them forth support them.
was not the ory+gynall grounde and cawse of M. Luthers heresye to do plea+sure to hys prynce, and to pur+chase fauoure amonge the peo+ple.
In lyke maner Oecolam padius, zwynglius, Pharellus, and other mo folowed the same trace.
when prynces co+mo~ties at first bent vppo~ affec+cyo~ agaynst ye church, or co~cey+ue any strau~ge purpose to scrypture: then immedyatly they fynde at hand suche lerned persons that can endeuoure theyr braynes in appro+uyng theyr lustes makynge yt whych ys vnlawfull lawfull, whych say that good is yuell yuell ys good, callyng lyghte darknes and darkenes lyght.
We shall finde the~ amo~g whych prech such thyngys as ye call heresye for no such cause but preche it boldely before great audye~ce, where they for theyr prechyng be brought in great danger.
→W. Though they do fall in harme, yet haue they hope to wynne theyr fauour or els why are they so de+syrous to haue so many ley me~ present at theyr examynacio~s? N.
They make of it a reaso+nable cause for .ii. co~sideracio~s One ys to thynte~t they myght not be wrongefully oppressyd in corners: a nother is because they wolde that people shulde bere wytnes of theyr co~stancy in confessyng the trouthe for Crystys sake.
→W. These co~+syderacyons in theym yf they were true as they be fals: were yet of small efficacite against the euangelyke perfeccion.
As towchynge the fyrste, god promyseth yf hys seruauntys be wrongyd pryuely he wyll reuenge them openly.
And Cryst in the gospell exhortyng vs to suffraunce byddeth hys dyscy+ples to be ioyful in persecucio~ sayng yt happy are ye when ye are belyed, euyll spoken apon, and extremely dealte wythall for my names sake.
The other apperythe to be an excuse of vaynglory couetynge wordly prays where as they perceyue that people fauourynge theyr parte wyll interprete to theyre commendacyon what so euer they say, though yt be agaynst scripture co~trary to all verite.
Saynt Peter wylleth vs to gyue acounte of our faythe to euery bodye and that my dely wyth all lowlynes.
we haue no presydent of thappostles, that euer they dysdayned to a~swere before the infydele iuges, tyll ye vulgare multytude were by them or that they requyred as+systence of great men to be recordes of theyre wordes. wher+fore meruell what co~scyence these persons haue whych are so importune to be examyned in presence of rude seculers ignoraunt people when they answere so dowtfully that the beste ernyd can not well con+strue theyre meanynge.
And in pryncypall artycles where vppon depe~deth our saluacyo~ or dampnacyon: some answer so nakydly with blynd shyfts, that they be able to brynge vn lernyd people in to erroure of thi~ges wherof they neuer dou+tyd before vsynge euer ouer thwart speche and quaylynge sentences of dowble vndersta~+dynge, wyth protestacyons of hypocrysye after thys fassion: In good fayth thynke there is a purgatorye, albeyt can not tell whether may beleue yt or no.
suppose that confes+syon made to a preest, and pyl+grymagys may be well done but fynde them not in scrypture: beleue in these wordis of Cryft, thys is my body but as concernyng hys bodely pre+sence in forme of breade, to say any thynge yt ys aboue my ca+pacyte and dare not medle with so dyffuse maters.
reke~ that may beleue ye doctours of the church yf they speke not agaynst the worde of god. &c.
To vse such a~bages in weygh+tye causes, to put in questyo~ a fresshe the cases defyned by generall counsels, as thoughe we were vncertayne of our be+lefe new to begyn agayn: repute yt no spyryte of trothe sekynge goddys honoure and edificacio~ of theyr neyghbour.
Nor dout not but at the day of iugeme~t, they shall make a more seryous answere.
Thys co~syderacyo~ is also as haue sayde very playnly false.
For whe~ these siy shyftes fayle the~: they shew no co~stancy of theyr vnfaythfull doctryne but falsely forswere them self and say they neuer sayd so the hole au+dye~ce detestyng theyr periury all saue onely theyr owne sect whyche as for periury pardon eche other.
To speke of manyfest myssliuers and open trans+gressours, whom may we well exempte? consyderynge howe prone and redy ye hole world is from the moste to the leste, to declyne and fall vnto euyll.
Our fayth whyche god hathe gyuen vs to bylde good workes vppon is waxen barayne fruteles.
Charyte lykewyse, wherin we shuld be tryed to be the very dyscyples of Cryst is waxed colde through ye excesse of iniquyte.
Amyable concorde wyth cryste~ vnyte, whervppo~ all vertue fastenyth her funda+cyon is fallen in ruyne to the fre entresse of hatefull dysce~io~ lyberte of al vyces.
In euery state and degre, ye one barkyth at the other one obiectyth agaynst a nother hys fawtys eche of theym facynge other to be causes of theyr myseryes yet neuer a one fassyoneth him selfe towarde any amendeme~t for hys owne parte.
N. By my trothe deme the people wold be good ynough, yf they had good heades.
→W. denye not ye verely, but the better that the heades be the better were the body lyke to be and ye euyll yt is in euyll heades desce~deth down in to euery parte, and maketh all the bodye the worse.
And yet surely yf ye people be euyll: the synne of them causeth god sometyme to send them heades of the same sute, bothe popes, emperours, kyngys, cardynallys, bysshoppes, prestys, and curatys.
For yt is the synne of the people as Iobtestyfyeth, that causeth god to suffer hypocrytys sometyme to rayne ouer theym.
Hypocry+tes he calleth theym that repre+sente the personages of these estates, whose partes they do playe for a countenaunce, and do the contrarye in dede.
And as farre as haue redde in ye byble all ye whyle yt the peple of Israhell were good obeyng goddys lawys and sought his honoure: god gaue theym gra+cyous gouernours, vertuous prestes, and trewe prophetes.
But as sone as they swaruyd fell vnto ydolatry: he se~t the~ for theyre punyshment vngracyous pryntes, vycyous prela+tys, and fals {pro}phetys so that no dyfference was betwene ye people the prestys nor ye peo+ple coud not ymagyne so outra+gyous abomynacyo~s, but prin+cys and prestys bothe were redy to fortefye them in theyr vn+happynes.
N. yet yf ye remember well the storyes of the byble ye shall fynde yt the tra~sgressyo~ of goddys law amo~g the peple redownded fyrst fro~ ye heades by theyr pernycyous occasyon.
And as to wchynge fals prophetes and yll prestes: god hym selfe complayneth apon them shewyng how the people are seducyd by them to the pollutynge of hys name and vyolacyon of hys la+wes. whose enmyous wyckednes Ezechiell, Hieremye, wyth dyuers other {pro}phetes, declare at length.
Dyd not the Belyal preastes Ophni Phynes by theyr pestylent example and le+cherous lyuynge corrupte ma+ny one vppon whom god takynge vengeaunce they loste theyr lyues in batayll and the arke of god wherof they had ye cure take~ by the Phylysteys xxx. thousande fyghtynge men of the Israhelyte people were slayne in one day.
Lykewyse ye chyldren of Samuell whyche were iuges of the peple not en+suynge theyre fathers steppes but set apo~ couetousnes, toke rewardes and peruertyd iuge+ment by whose occasyon the people were mouyd to aske a kynge vnto theyr desolacyon.
Moreouer the storye of kynge Saull is playn, for whose pry+uate dysobedye~ce ye hole lande of Israhell smarted full sore.
Kyng Dauyd though he was a blyssed ma~, yet brought vnto foly for to nomber his people they were fayne to suffer moste wofull plages for hys offence.
Manye other lyke placys coud gather out of ye olde testa+ment, were yt nat to eschew tedyousnes specyally of Hieroboam, whom ye scrypture testy+fyeth expresly, that he caused ye peple of Israhell to synne.
Be+syde all thys go to the very ex+peryence and ye shall fynde yt where soeuer the heade or go uernour of an howse ys good the hole howsholde comenlye shall be good also.
And contra+ry wyse yf they be badde the other shall be as euyll so that may conclude in veryfyeng myne opynyon that the yll co~+uersacyon of subgectys procedyth out of ye euyll example of theyr heades.
To begyn where as ye leaue graunt yt the vertuous exa~ple of ye head auayleth moch to the good order of the members the grea+ter that the auctoryte ys, the more strength yt hath in exam+ple, eyther to profyte or to noy consyderyng that amonge pry+uate persons the goodnesse of some one, e~ducyth many other to vertue contrary the lewd+nes of another, bryngeth many to vyce vngracyousnes.
But yet ca~ not ye apon thys, that ye euylnes of the peo+ple comyth fyrste by the exa~ple of the heades but rather as haue spoken before, because ye peple be euyll them selfs ther+fore god sendyth theym according yll heades gouernours.
For ye must consyder that god hath not made the people for ye sensuall pleasure of pryncys, gouernours, or prelatys but hath ordeyned them to yt we all and commodyte of the people.
ye haue in Exodus the thyrde chapyter, that when the peple of Israhell were in myserable thraldome vnder kynge Pharo: they cryed to god for remedye and god prouyded theym Moyses to be theyr delyuerer to whom in gyuyng his he sayde: The clamoure of the childre~ of Israhell is come vn+to me and haue sene theyr af+flyccyons how they are oppres+syd of the Egypcians: therfore approche and shall sende the to belyuer my peple. ye, god lo+ued the peple so entyerly, that of theym he chose bysshoppes, prestes, and deakenes, to offer specyall sacrefyces for the clen+synge of theyre synnes and to be as meanes betwene hym the.
Note of whom also Moyses toke the noble wyse men made of the~ prices, captayns and gouernours, for theyre po+lytyke conseruacion.
Agreable to this the storyes of Iudicum make that the people of Israhell longe season after Iosues death obseruyng goddys lawes and fulfyllyng hys commaundeme~tes prosperyd in peace and hadde gracyous gouernours.
But whe~ they fel to synne ydolatry: god gaue them in to subieccyon of theyr enemyes and were compellyd whether they wolde or not to serue hethen pryncys and mys+creau~t ydolaters yet notwyth+standynge in myddys of theyr myseryes, where as wyth a repentau~t hart they cryed to god for socour, and besought hym of mercy: he raysde vp among the~ selues certayne captaynes at so~dry tymes as Othonyell, Ayoth, Gedeo~, Sampson, and dyuers other whyche delyuered them from all bondage re+storynge the~ agayne to theyr ly+berte.
And where as ye allege the chyldren of Helye to haue bene cawse of the takynge of the arke and slawghter of the people: beleue verely that ye peple were then myscheuously myndyd as they be nowe a dayes. whyche perceyuyng yt the ii. prestes yt bare ye arke wherby they hopyd of victory, were slayne: they surmysed that the vengeau~ce for the prestes synnes was cawse why the arke was take~ and so moche people destroyed.
vnder this blynde audacyte they remayned styll impenyte~t not aknowlegyng to god theyre owne offences ydolatrye: whych apperyth by the returne agayn of the arke where aboue the nomber of .l. thousande persons were plagyd with sodayne deth.
Also it may be verefyed by ye wordys of Samuell exhortyng the peple to returne vnto god wyth harte vnfaynyd and to caste owte all straunge goddys, pre+parynge theyr hartys to ye seruyce of god onely.
For when they hadde fastyd and done pe+nau~ce, not imputynge ye fawte to other but to the~ selfs sayng all we good lorde haue synned agaynst the: god delyuered the~ from theyre enemyes.
In lyke maner ye mysorder of Samuel lys sonnes was not so greatly the occasyon whye the people were mouyd to aske a kyng for to reygne ouer theym as was theyr owne dyffydence toward goddys puisio~, obstynate dysobedyence, and vnquyete appetyte of ydolatrye couetynge to be lyke other hethe~ nacyo~s: whyche is to be {per}ceyued by the answere of god vnto Samuel thus sayng: Here the peoples voyce in all thynges that they speke vnto the they haue nott cast yt of but me, least shulde ouer the~.
They do eue~ accordyng to all theyr workes whyche they dyd in the daye yt brought them out of Egypt hytherto.
As they haue forsaken me seruyd fals goddys thus do they also to the.
when Samuell hadde shewed vnto them the dyspleasure of god, wyth the manyfolde myseryes and calamytyes whyche they shulde suffer by the chaunge: yet wolde they not here hym but sayd that nedys they wold haue a kynge ouer them as other people had.
Furthermore ye afferme yt ye people of Israhel were punyshed for the dyso+bedyent of kyng Saull.
But all thynges consy+dered yt ys to be thoughte rather that their wylful froward+nes agaynst god was partely occasyon of hys fall to thente~t the sentence of god spoken by ye prophet myght be verefyed.
For yf he had bene an vpright prynce had obserued goddes commaundement: they shulde haue bene in such felycyte that they wolde haue iuged theyre lawfull in demaundyng a kynge co~trary to goddys pleasure.
And dowt not but god gaue them a kynge of dysposycyon lyke to theyre demeanoure so yt when he trans+gressyd goddys p~cept in dede they dyd the same, at the laste i~ wyll co~sent wherby they de+seruyd to be punysshed wyth hym.
For god neuer taketh ve~+geaunce apon ony people but onely for theyre synne whyche dyuers admonycio~s why les they wyll not amende eue~ as he gyueth to the good people gracyous heades and pryn+ces, furtheryng them in his fa+uour to theyr so sendeth he to the euyll wyckyd heades rulers, prouoking his wrath to theyr desolacio~.
And no mer+uell thoughe Saull faryd the worse for hys people wher as Moyses the most faythfull ser+uaunte of god was partely by their frowardnes debarred fro~ the pleasaunt lande of behest.
As for kyng dauyd, it is playn that god dyspleasyd wyth the chyldern of Israhell for theyr synnes: {per}myttyd Satha~ to in+cyte hym for to no~ber hys peo+ple, wherfore they were bothe punysshed.
And though scrypture expressely saythe that Hie causyd ye peple to synne: yet were they as mich fauty as he saue yt because they co~mytted theyre ydolatry vnder hys supportacyon, he bare ye name as pryncypall auctor: as we se ye captay as of hostes in warre tyme thoughe some of them do sometyme as lytell or lesse tha~ many a poore souldyer in hys armye whose acte is nothynge spoken of yet all the fame and honour of the vyctory rebown+dyth euer vnto them. whych is apartely prouyd by the oracyo~ of king Abya Roboams sone laynge to the peoples charge that they forsoke god made them golde~ calues expulsyng the prestes deakenes of goddys ordynaunce, and instytutynge other after the order of hethen ydolaters. wherto agre+eth in defence of myne opynio~, the generall confessyon of the people wyth theyre vnyuersall submyssyo~ i~ knowlege of theyr trespaces, recyted i~ sondry pla+cys of scrypture after thys for me: we haue synned wyth our forefathers we haue done wyc+kedly, haue co~mytted iniquy+re all we haue tra~sgressyd thy commaundementys.
And sure+ly as the worlde is nowe crokedly enclyned to malyce: yf god sente heades and pryncys accordyng to the ap+petytes of mych peple ye welth of this regyo~ wold be sone sub+uerted euerye state broughte to confusyon, albeit they other+wyse coloure yt and make as though they ment non harme, but rather mych deuocyon yt the vnlerned wolde haue the scrypture in to theyre handys for none other cause but onely to preche secretly to them selfe for lacke of good preachours abrode.
But then in dede ap+peryth that they preach to the~ self and theyr neyghbours to, many an horryble horosye, and abuse the scrypture to the colo+rable defence of the same.
And then are they also to, all Tyndals bokys whych for the manyfolde mortall heresyes conteyned within the same openly condempnyd and forbeden they are saye yet vnto those bokes so sore affeccionate, that neyther the condempnacyo~ of them by the clergy, nor the for bedyng of them by the kyngys hyghnes with his open procla+macyo~s vppon great paynes nor the dau~ger of open shame, nor parell of paynfull deth ca~ cast the~ out of some fond folkis handes, and that folke of euery sorte.
Howe thynke ye then these folke wold haue bene sto+maked, how many mo wold haue blustred, owt with them yf the mayntenau~ce of the pryn+ces and the states of the reame (whych our lorde defende) had bene vppon theyre syde.
And where abowt wolde they then haue gone? abowte no great good ye maye be sure.
Se ye not the vyllayne beggers and valyau~t vagabou~des, whom god plageth with pouerte and myserye for theyr abomynable lyuynge dysposed to no good+nes, howe hartely they wysshe for a ruffelynge daye.
Beholde euery state all moste in euery cryste~ realme, as husband me~, artyfycers, marchaunts, courtyers, wyth all other degrees as well spyrituall as te~porall fere me that ye shall saye, but yf god of hys goodnes ame~de vs the soner there shall come to passe amonge vs the ferefull iugeme~t of god spoke~ by the prophete see, to the people of Israhell and inhaby+ters of the lande: There is no trothe, no mercye, nor scyence of god in the yerth.
Cursynge lyenge, manslaughter, theft, and aduowtrye hathe bloode hathe towchyd bloode: for the which the yerth shall wayle, and euery inhaby+ter in yt shall be feeblyd.
And thys as haue sayde not one contrey fawty a nother fawt+les, one estate fowle and defor+med and another pure clene, the spyrytualtye synfull and ye temporaltye set all on vertue, the heades rulers culpable the people owt of blame, nor yt ony estate maye laye the hole weyght of goddes wrath vnto the other and therof discharge them selfe but eche of them ys cause both of theyr own harme and other folkys to.
And the people are nothynge lesse fawty prouokynge the wrathe of god, than theyre heades or go+uernoures nor one state party culerly cawse of anothers calamyte.
But all we togyther haue synned haue deseruyd the vengeau~ce of god, whyche hangyth before our eyes redy to fall ere we be aware.
In thys poynte ye haue ryght well satysfyed my mynde: but what remedye now of reconcy lyacyon agayne to god? →W. Forsothe knowe none but onely penaunce.
saye not repentyng onely as Luther and Tyndall and these new folkes call yt which wolde begyle vs and make vs wene yt we nede no more but onely repent and do no penaunce at all tellyng vs that Crystys passyon shall stand in stede of all our penau~+ce, though we do neuer so euill and lyue neuer so longe. wyth thys false doctryne they dryue many a soule to the deuyll ma+kynge theym neglygente and take lytell care or sorowe for theyre synne and so myche the more rechelesse in fallynge to synne agayne.
But speke of penaunce as yt unplyeth both repe~tau~ce of our synnes past ye sacrament of peuau~ce, wyth care sorow and bodely payn afflyccyo~ taken for our syn, wyth prayer, almouse, other good workys to purchase the more grace yt we shuld wyth recourse to confessyon the sa+crament of penau~ce, dylyge~tly prepare our selues in folowi~g the exa~ple of the whyche at the preachynge of the prophete Ionas, repentyd wyth ernest purpose of amendynge theyr lyues and dyd pe+naunce in deede, in fastynge and prayer, humblynge theyre sowles frome the moste to the least vnto the mercy of god.
N. wolde our lorde that we had such a {pro}phete sent among vs to exhorte vs vnto penau~ce as the prophete Ionas was to theym.
→W. That were lyke to the request of the ryche glut+tone in hell of who~ the gospell telleth whych desyred that La+zare myghte besente to warne hys brethern: to whom yt was answeryd, that hauynge Moy+ses the prophetes, they shuld gyue credence to theym. wher+fore seynge that we haue holy scrypture which expressyth the rightwysnes of god declaring howe our forefathers were pu+nysshed for theyr synnes: yf we refuse to be warnyd by theyre admonycyon, truely we wolde be as neglygent to amende, yf Ionas raysed fro~ death to lyfe shulde preache vnto vs.
For we haue saynt Iohu~ baptyst a greater {pro}hete tha~ Ionas was cryenge to all synners: Do ye worthy frutes of penaunce: of whom Cryste wytnessyth that there ys none greater than he amonge the chyldre~ of wome~.
Also oure saue our Cryste hym self, of whom saynt Ihon~ resty+fyed that he was vnworthy to lose his shoo latchet: preachyd penaunce saynge: Do ye penaunce, the kyngdome of heuyn is at hande.
And in another place of the gospell he sayth: yf ye do not penaunce ye shall all perysshe.
And saynte Peter his vycare here i~ yerth, vppo~ whom and whose fayth+full confessyon he promysed to bylde hys church: preachyd ly+kewyse in hys fyrste sermone sayng: Do ye penau~ce and be conuertyd to god, that youre synnys maye be done awaye.
Also saynt poule the chose ves+sell of god, preached fyrst of all to them of Damasco, that they shuld be penytent and turne to god {per}fourmynge the due war+kes of penaunce.
Co~fyrmynge the same when Cryst apperyd vnto the .ii. dyscyples iorneing to Emaus: he sayd yt after his death and resurreccyon yt be houyd penau~ce to be preachyd in hys name and remyssyon of synnes: for why ye cause of his comynge was not to call rygh teo{us} folk but synners vnto pe+naunce.
And the aungellys of heuyn reioyced not so greatly in nynty nyne iuste persons, as vppo~ one synner doyng pe+nau~ce.
As concernyng the olde testament god hym selfe promyseth in dyuers placys, that a synner shall be forgyuen hys synnes whe~ so euer he wyll do pena~ce. wherfore sei~g we haue so euyde~t exhortacyo~s of scryp+ture mouynge vs to penau~ce, and manyfolde warnynges to correcte our lyues through the the pacyent suffraunce of god: happy ar we yet, yf now at last ere that yt be to late me cowde faythfully say wyth Iobe perfourming ye dede: lord we haue hard ye wyth oure eares, ther+fore we rep~he~de our selfes do penau~ce.
→W. haue onys told you yet tell you agayn call pe+nau~ce a chau~ge of our lyfe i~ castyng of ye synfull old ma~ with hys dedys, and doynge on a new man of vertuous conuetsacyon whiche by fayth, hope, and charyte, and the good wor+kes yt come of them as prayer almouse, sorow for hys synne, and payne gladly taken and susteyned for the same ys renewed in to the knowledge and fauoure of god, accordynge to hys ymage that made hym.
N. how shuld laye me~ come to thys knowlege when ye gospell ys lockyd fro them.
The gospell of Cryste whyche ys goddes worde is free, and can not be bou~de nor kepte fro~ any Crysten man.
N. By saynt Marye for all that saye people maye not be fuffred to haue the newe testament men glysshe, whyche call the gos+pell.
In dede though Tyndall was the tra~s+latour yt ys the worde of god and the verye same testament whyche ye haue in latyn of the euangelystes puttynge forth.
→W. yet lernyd me~ and good men haue founden suche fawtys in hys corrupt translacio~: that yt ys for the same well lawfully forbede~.
N. yf they be good men as ye saye yt haue founde yt fauty: shuld reken the~ better a great deale whych wold ame~de it.
→W. Though yt were ame~dyd suffycyently correctyd: yet wyll not say yt yt ys expedyent for lay people to haue yt co~syderyng ye tyme as yt ys nowe. N. whye ye sayd yt the gospell maye not be kept fro~ crysten me~.
→W. No more yt maye though yt be restrayned frome the laye people in theyr vulgare tonge.
For ye worde of god whyche ys the worde of faythe as scrypture sayth is nere the in thy mouth in thy harte to thentent thou mayste do yt. N. Than praye you where saynt Poule sayth that fayth comyth by herynge, and herynge comyth by the worde of god: how can we haue yt wythout prechynge or informacyon of yt by redynge of scrypture.
→W. Outwarde prechyng and lyterall redyng of scrypture are necessary mea+nes to attayne vnto the know+lege of the spyryte.
N. wher+fore then ys the gospell wythholden frome the laye people? →W. sayd they be two thyn+ges necessary but sayd not that bothe twayne be to euery man necessary.
But yt is neces+sary that euery man haue the tone or the tother, and so haue they: for they haue the worde of god prechid expowned vn+to

But why shuld not the come~ peple haue the scrypture them self in theyr awn mother tong? →W Because of theyr abuse makyng of theyr awne glosys, many also for theyr vnworthy+nes, accordynge to Crystes co~+maundement forbeddynge to cast before swyne, or to gyue holy thyngis to dogges.
Dyd not saynt Paule forbede women to speake the worde of god in congregacyons, for the auoydyng of abuse and dysor+der? Also dyd not he and Bat+nabas forsake prechyng to the iewes because of theyr vnwor+thynes? N. That is not a lyke case: for the text is playn yt the iewes wylfully resystyd the worde of god, and wolde not receyue yt.
But these people are so desyrous that they putte theym selfes in no small ieopardye many tymes for the hauyng of yt. →W. graunt there be some which of a good mynde are desyro{us} to haue the gospell in theyr mother to~ge, for ye erudycio~ of theyr soules.
But they that be suche good folk may be wel suffici+e~tly fed with ye gospell p~ched so wyll they rather chese to be than to haue the scrypture ronne in euery rasshe bodyes hande, yt wold abuse it to their owne harme and other menys to.
For well ye wot many ther he, and as yt apperethe in Almayn where they haue the scri+pture all redy the more parte and farre the grea+ter multytude, are not lesse vn+worthy in receyuynge yt, than were the iewes in the wylfull resystau~ce of Crystes gospell· whych couet it onely for the ly+bertye to be fre from the excer+cyse of penaunce and doyng of good workes, to rayle and iest of other mennes fawtes wyth+out any correccio~ of theyr own synfull lyues nothyng confor+mable to the vertew of the gos+pell, whereof to bable many wordes they are not dombe.
Mark it there substauncyally in cyties and townes where ye se ye people most ryfest moste busye to prate of the gospell whether they be or not as gret vsurers, dysceyuers of theyre neybours, blasphemous sweters, euyll spekers, and gyuen to all vyces as depely as euer they were.
Thys am sure of and dare boldely afferme that sythe the tyme of thys new co~te~ryous lernyng, the drede of god ys gretely quenched, and charytable co~passyon sore aba+bated.
Shall ye not se there a cock braynyd courtyer yt hath no more faythe tha~ a Turk, lesse crysten maners tha~ a Pa+gane, with lordely cou~tenau~ce knauysh condycyons which takyng ye name of god i~ bayn, shall vnreuerently alledge the gospell with scoffyng and scor+nynge in reprehensyon of the clargye: where as hys owne lewd lyuynge is so vnthryfty, that ye can not aspye one good poynt in hym, except yt be apo~ hys hosen nor a nynche of honesty besyde his apparayle nor scantly theron neyther, beyng all to hackyd iaggyd, wyth dowble weapen redy to fyght, and syngle wyt busy to brawle and chyde more lyke a furyo{us} tormentour of Herode, than a pacye~t dysciple of Cryst Shal ye not also se there a marchau~t made a gentyll ma~ by promocion, ere euer that he had a good yema~s whych gettynge hys chefe sub+staunce as many do there by vsury false dysceyte of trewe people, and other wrongfull wayes wyll take apon hym to preache the gospell agaynste the auaryce of relygyous persones how they hauyng theyr bare necessary foode, ought to parte ye resydue of theyr gooddes wyth pore peple: where as he hym selfe hath thousandes lyenge by hym in store vnoccu+pyed, and wyll nother help his poore neyghbour nor scarcely gyue a galy halpeny to a nedy creature in extreme necessyte.

And by ye tyme they haue eate~ more than ynoughe, and haue dronken to moch: they be redy to wade forth in ye depe mysteryes of scrypture wyllynge to be teachers of thynges wherof they vndersta~de not what they speke nor what they afferme.
Then are they full armyd to talke of abstynence and dyet of thappostles: their table beynge furnysshed wyth sump+tuous dysshes and exquysyte deyntyes.
And where as theyr cuppbordes be ryally garnysshed with costely plate, and the tables full of cuppes and peces of syluer and golde: than make they exclamacyo~s agai~st the rych iewellys of chyrches, as crosses and chalyses sayng that better it were to make mo+ney of them and to be dystribu+tyd vnto pore peple, than they shulde perysshe for lacke of socoure· Lykewyse when they be seruyd at theyr solempnytyes, wyth counterfeyted curtesyes, in bowynge the kne, valyng the bonet, hauyng sewers and and karuers after a moste stately maner of seruyce, wherin yf the offycers fayle neuer so lytell though yt be but the settynge of a sawcer amysse they shall be rebukyd: yet theyr pacyence can not brooke the honeste ceremonyes of the churche to be lawdably done callynge theym folysshe fantasyes inuencyons of ydyotes.
And though some of these new gospellers occupye trewelye and iustly wyth theyre neyghbours in face of the worlde, be hauynge them selfes charytably: yet are they very few in co~+paryson of the other, whyche be raylers gesters, vycyous lyuers fals hypocrytes wyth owt ony conscyence.
N. As for hypocrytes thynke ye myght fynde soner amongere lygyous persons.
haue walkyd a great parte through owte all the prouynces of cryste~dome, and haue sene and marcked the state of relygyous persons of dyuers orders: yet sawe neuer amonge them suche colouryd hypocrysye, so flesshely lybertye abusyd, vnder ye pretence of fayned holynes as amonge many of these late inuentyd faccyons.
And certyfye yow that ye maye fynde mo dyuers sectys of erronyo{us} opynyons among them in one cyte beyonde the se: than be son+drye orders of religyous peple in all Englonde.
Suppose ye ye gospell to be in faute of thys? →W. Naye but the abuse of the people hauyng yt in theyr vulgare la~guage: for whome yt were better to receyue yt by the mynystracyon of faythfull preachers, than vnworthely to take it them selfs. we haue in the gospell yt oure sauyour Cryst tedynge the no~+ber of .v. thousand men besyde women and chyldren fyrst gyuyng thankys to his father he blyssed the breade, brake yt gaue yt to hys dyscyples, and they dystrybutyd yt to the com+pany and so they dyd eate and were sacyate.
N. Syr accordyng to thys ye peple shuld holde them very well content, yf so be they had faythfull pre+chers to mynyster the worde of god vnto the~.
But put case they haue none, or ellys that theyr peachers be suche as the {pro}phete co~playneth on whych preache ye vysyo~ of theyr not of ye mouth of god: seking also theyr owne worldly proffyte, and not the gostly co~fort of theyr cures.
→W. beleue yt god hath not lefte his chyrch destytute of faythfull preachers wyth the whych he hath {pro}mnysed to be contynually pre+sent vnto the worldys ende.
How be yt the fewer that they be the more fawte is to be imputed vnto the peple, becawse they aske not worthely of god trewe preachers.
For the gospell sheweth that the people came fyrst to Cryst and he per+ceyuyng the~ was mouyd wyth compassyon vppon theym, becawse they were as sheepe hauynge no hearde and so feadynge theyr sowles spyrytually, afterwarde he dyd repaste theyre bodyes wyth corporall foode. wherfore yf they in lyke maner approche vnto Cryste (in whose name what so euer is desyred of the father shall be grau~tyd) he wyll also here gra+cyously theyr petycyon: for the hande of god is not abreuyatt nowe nor hys power other+wyse mynysshed than yt was at that tyme.
N. yet am not so satysfyed wyth all the reasons yt ye haue made but thynke styll that yt were lawfull for laye people to haue the new testament in Englysshe: perauenture wyth a lytell leyser cowd lay suche scrypture for yt that scant ye shuld be able to obiecte ony contradyecyon.
But in the meane tyme thys ye must consyder yt our question is not whyther it be lawfull to let them haue yt but whyther yt be vnlawfull to kepe them from it and why ther of the twayn is more mete and more expedyent, specyally for the tyme that nowe ys the peple beynge dysposed as they now be and after suche ensam+ple as we see before oure iyen, with suche fruyte as we fynde growe~ therof in Almayne all redy and in many placys euyn here at home also.
But yf euer the tyme come as praye god yt may in whyche the people shall be so good and so godly dysposed that an englysshe by+ble shuld do good in theyr han+des: yet myght Tyndals trans+lacyon in no wyse be suffered.
N. well shall bethynke me tyll we mete agayne and then wyll be so bolde also to take Tyndals parte in defe~ce of hys translacyon and other bokys which he hath put forth in englysshe, allegyng the best that can for theyr alowance: to thentent maye see what stronge reasons ye can brynge to co~fute them.
→W. Ther wyth am ryghte well pleasyd and trust with goddes help to answer you so effectuou+sly that ye shall not counte the tyme passed in vayne.

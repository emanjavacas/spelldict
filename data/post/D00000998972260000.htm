the declaration of the rebels in scotland it is not unknown to a great part of the world how happy the church of scotland was whilst she enjoyed the ordinances of jesus christ in purity and power of the which we have been deplorably deprived by the of prelacy so it is evident not only to impartial persons but professed enemies with what unparallelled patience and constancy the people of god have endured all cruelties injustice and oppression that the wit or malice of prelates and malignants could invent or exercise
and being most unwilling to any thing which might import opposition to lawful authority or engage the kingdom in war although we have been a long time groaning under the overturning of the work of reformation corruption of doctrine slighting of worship despising of ordinances and the changing of the antient and government thrusting our so many of our faithful ministers from their charge confining straightly imprisoning exiling yea and putting to death many of them and introducing upon their flocks a company of insufficient and scandalous persons

and fining confining imprisoning torturing tormenting and scourging stigmatizing poor people plundring their goods and quartering upon them rude souldiers selling of their persons to foreign plantations horning and

intercommoning many whereby great numbers in divers corners of the land were forced to leave their dwellings wives children and relations and made to wander as pilgrims in hazard of their lives none daring to reset or receive them harbo supply them though starving or so much as speak to them for fear of the same punishments

and these things acted under colour of law and in effect tending to banish not only all sense of religion but also to extinguish all natural affection even among persons of the nearest relations and likewise groaning under the intollerable yoke of oppression in all our civil bodies and so a a of have most arbraly exercised upon us through a tract of divers years particularly in the year
by sending against us an armed host of barbarous savages contrary to all law and humanity and by laying on us several impositions and taxes as formerly so of late by a meeting of and overawed members in a convention of estates in july
for up of intrusted as to a great part of in hands of avowed papists or favourers of them by whom sundry invasions have been made upon us and most exorbitant abuses with incredible insolencies committed against
and we being continually sought after for diviner worship ministers and apprehended and most rigorously and so being attend the lords ordinances in the field even in the place there often hunted out to the of amd many of us· so that we were either

selves by arms at these meetings or be altogether deprived of the gospel preached by christs faithful ministers

slaves
and at one of whese meeting on the first of being the lords day captain graham of claors being· warranted late proclamation to kill whomsoever he in aos at field conventicles did furiously assault the people and provoke did elly bind like· beasts a minister other people whom he did that very morning find
and several being killed on both sides and they knowing that by their law if apprehended they behoved they to their own defence and continued together and there after ny of our friends and country being under the same and expecting the same measure did freely offer their assis

we therefore being inevitably and of absolute necessity forced to take this last remedy the magistrates having shut the door by a law against any application that whatsoever our grievances either in civil or sacred matters be we had not the priviled of a supplicant or petitioner
do judge our selves bound to declame that these with many other horrid grievances in church and state which we purpose to manifest more fully hereafter are the true causes of this our lawful and innocent self defence
and we do most solemnly in the presence of almighty god the searcher of hearts declare that the true reasons of our continuing in arms are candidly and sincerely these
first the defending and securing the true protestant religion and presbyterial government founded on the word of god and summarily comprehended in our confession of faith and catechisms and established by the laws of this land to which the king nobles and people are solemnly engaged in our national and solemn league and covenant
and more particularly the defending and maintaining the kingly authority of our lord jesus christ over his church against all sinful supremacy deregatory thereto and incroching thereupon
secondly the preserving and defending the kings majesties person and authority in preservation and defence of the true religion of the kingdom that the world may bear witness with our consciences of our loyalty that we have no thoughts nor intentions to diminish his just power and greatness
thirdly the obtaining of a free and unlimited parliament and a free general assembly in order to the redressing the aforesaid grievances for preventing the eminent danger of popery and extirpating prelacy
this therefore being the cause we doe appeare for and do resolve in gods great name to own hereby homologating or assenting to all the testimonies of all the faithful sufferers for truth in scotland these eighteen years

we humbly request the kings majesty would be pleased to restore all things as he found them when god brought him home to his crown and kingdoms and if that cannot be obtained then we heartily and humbly invite intreat beseech and obtest in the bowels of jesus christ all who are under the same bonds with us to concur in the defence of this common cause and interest and that they would not stand still and

see not only us oppressed the foresaid cause ruined adversaries highly and proudly insult against god and all good men
friends of the truth discouraged yea the protestant religion in brittane and ireland destroyed but even themselves within a little while made a prey of or else force when we are broken which the good lord prevent dreadfully to wrong their own conscience

finally because we desire no mans hurt or blood we request our country men now the standing forces of the kingdom some of them being our friends and kinsmen not to fight against us least in so doing they be found fighting against god whose cause and quarrel we are sure he will own and signally countenance seeing we fight under his banner who is the lord of hosts

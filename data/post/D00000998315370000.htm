notes upon both globs celestial and terrestial
first concerning the celestial
globe
it is the model of heaven but cheifly of the eight sphere wherein three things are to be observed in general viz
definition

delineations

use

the definition
it is a sphericalbody having a point or center in the middest from whence right lines being extended to the superficies they are all equal

delineations
which are these three

the lines or circles

the principal points

the figures or constellations

first of the lines or circles every of wch are actually or intellectually divided into equal parts called degrees the more principle whereof are these ten which make up the sphaera armillaris six whereof are great circles as be all those which divide the globe into two equal parts or hemispheres having the same center with the globe and the other four are called smaller circles because they divide the globe into two unequal parts or segments
the six great circles are these

the horizon is the broad circle upon the frame this divideth the globe into two hemispheres the one which we see is alwaies above the horizon the other which we see not is below and on the horizon are drawn divers circles viz of the signes and of the daies of the months and the winds


the meridian is the brass circle which standeth at right angles to the horizon and in

which the globe is hanged and turned about on its poles which are the ends or extremitys of the axis of the world and upon the meridian is another little hour circle fastened with an index moving about upon the pole

the equinoctial is drawn upon the superficies of the globe in the middest between the two poles of the world and the degrees thereof are numbred with to
the eliptick line this cutteth the equinoctial in two points and is divided into signes each containing degrees and it passeth in the middest of the zodiac for the zodiac is a broad cicle containing degrees in breadth and is the bounder of the planets

the equinoctial colure this cutteth the equinoctial at right angles in the two points where the ecliptick passeth over the same equinoctial line and so passeth through the poles of the world

the solstitial colure this passeth through the ecliptick where it toucheth both the tropicks and cutteth both the equinoctial and ecliptick at right angles and passeth through the poles of the world where also it cutteth the equinoctial colure at right angles
the four lesser circles are


the two tropicks each being parallel to the equinoctial and about degrees

from it
that which is toward the north pole is called the tropick of cancer that which is towards the south pole is called the tropick of capricorne and these are the bounders of the greatest declination of the sun

the two polar cirles these are so far distant from the poles of the world as the tropicks are from the equinoctial that which is next to the north pole is talled the artick polar circle and that which is next the south pole is called the antartick polar circle
there are moreover drawn upon this globe divers other great circles passing by the begining of the twelve signes cutting each other in two opposite points and these with the solstitial colure divide the globe into equal parts and these are called the circles of the longitude of stars
also through every point of the meridian there are small circles imagined to be drawn parallel to the equinoctial which are called the parallels of declination of the sun stars
also the like small circles are imagined to be drawn parallel to the horizon and these are called almicantars or circles of altitude
the second thing noted in the delineation in the points to be observed on the globe


the more principal are these viz
the two points on which the globe is hanged

and turned about within the brazen meridian these represent the poles of the world from one of which to the other there passeth a streight line through the center of the globe called the axis of the world where note that the two poles of the world are the common sections of all the meridian circles

the two poles of the ecliptick which are the two points in which the six circles of longitude of stars do cross or cut each other and is near about degrees minutes distant from the poles of the world

the points of zenith and nadir the zenith is that point in the heavens which is directly over our head and the nadir is on the contrary directly under our feet these two are the poles of the horizon being every where degrees from it and in these two points do all the vertical or azimuthal circles meet or cut each other

the points of cast and west viz
the two points where the equinoctial cutteth the horizon these are also diametrically opposite and are the poles of the meridian being every where degrees from it


the two equinoctial points of aries libra being two points where the ecliptick cutteth the equinoctial and are diametrically opposite the former is called the vernal equinoctial

because the sun coming to it the spring beginneth the other is called the autumnal equinoctial because when the sun commeth to it the autumn beginneth

the two solstitial points being also diametrically opposite are the two points on the globe where the ecliptick toucheth the two tropicks the ecliptick in their touch point viz in the beginning of cancer and capricorn and these two are called solstitial points because the sun moving in the ecliptick near either of them which is in june and december it causeth the daies to stand still a while without a sensible lengthning or shortning
here is to be noted that the horizon and meridian circles are said to be immoveable because they are fixed to the same place but all other circles of the sphear are said to by moveable because they being drawn upon the surface of the globe or sphere must need move about it in the diurnal motion yet other men denominate them by the contrary names
the third thing observed in the delineations are the figures drawn upon the globe

there have been asterismes or con+stellations observed of ancient time and about them in this globe are described cer+tain figures not because there are any such fi+gure

in the heavens but are only imagined there to give denomination to the stars of the firmament and yet not to all the stars for they are innumerable but only to such as are most conspicuous and whereof use may best be made as occasion serveth
there are constellations of the zodiack through which the zodiack passeth and these give denomination to the signs of the zodiack in particular these with their number of stars
of old
of late
of old of late
subli there have been constellations observed on the north side of the ecliptick which are called the northern constellations whose names and number of stars here follow
of old
the little bear the great bear the dragon cepheus bootes the northern crown hercules the vulture cadent the swan cassiopeia perseus auriga serpentarius the serpent the arrow or dart the eagle the dolphin the lesser horse pegasus or great horse andromeda the northern triangle
there are constellations on the south side of the eliptick which are called the southern constellations whose names and number of stars here follow
of old
the whale orion the river eridanus the hare the great dog the lesser dog the ship the goblet the raven the centaur the wolf the altar the southern crown the
besides the number of the stars noted in the former constellations the modern astronomers have noted divers others which were left informes by the ancients and put them into their proper figures as may be seen in some of the globes put forth since noble ticho brahe namely johannes jansonius his small globes of the year
and in petrus plantius his globes of the year
the new constellations in north latitude are these
berenices hair the bee the river jordan camelopardalis the river euphrates
the new constellations in south latitude are these
the lesser crabb the unicorne

moreover because the antient astronomer lived all in north latitude they could not se the stars which are near the south pole bu they have been since discovered by such a have travailed that way and are put into con+stellations namely these the dove the southern triangle the apous indica the peacock the indian the crane the towcan the hydrus the phenix the dorado the sea swallow the camelion the cross called crusero the flye besides the constellations before named there are some other appearances in the hea+vens namely the white broad circle calle
via lactea or milkie way and two littl clouds observed near the south pole
thu much of the delineation or things noted the outside of the celestial globe
the third thing to be observed in general is the use of this globe
which consisteth in these three things following
viz
the knowlegde of the

motions

division
and operation on the
propositions
in the first place of motions which are two in number viz
the diurnal motion

the proper motion
first concerning the motions

the diurnal motion is made upon the poles of the world once about from east toward the west in hours and this is also called motus raptus or the motion of the prinum mobile


the second motion is called the annuall motion is made within the primuu mobile upon the poles of the ecliptick according to the succession of the signes which is contrary to that of the primum mobile viz from west

toward east and this motion is called motus scundus or motus proprius because that every sphere hath a motion proper to it self as tha of the sun sun finisheth once about secundum seriem signorum in the space of months which is called the solar year also venus venus and mercurie mercury are moved about the same way in the same time but the moon moon is moved about in one month and the month is two sorts for the time wherein the moon moon departeth from any point of the zodiack and returneth to it again is called the periodicall month or month of peragration but the time wherein the moon departeth from the sun sun and overtaketh him again is called the month of consecration or synodica
month
mars mars moveth through the zodiack in about two solar years and that time is called the year of mars mars
jupiter jupiter is moved through the zodiack in about solar years and that time is called the year of jupiter jupiter
saturne saturn in about years runneth through the zodiack and that time is called the year of saturne saturn


the fixed stars according to ptolomie move about the zodiack in solar years but according to the alphofines in

years and according to capernicus in years but gassendus hath it years and this time is called the great year or platonical year
secondly concerning the divisions

first it is called sphera recta or a right sphere because in such position the equinoctial cutteth the horizon at right spherical angles
the properties of the sphere is to have the poles of the world ly in the horizon and the equinoctial passeth through the zenith and nadir and in this sphere not only the equinoctial but also both the trophicks and all other the equinoctial parallels are divided into two equal parts by the right horizon which causeth the daies and nights at all times of the yeat to be equal viz hours long between sun rising and setting without alteration to those who live under the equinoctial line


secondly it is called sphaera obliqua whereof there are so many in number as there be degrees minutes seconds in a quadrant and it is called oblique because the equinoctial cutteth the horizon with an oblique angle the properties of this sphere is to have one pole elevated above the horizon and the other as far depressed also because in this sphere the equinoctial is divided equally by

the horizon and the parallels of the equinoctial unequally therefore the daies and the nights are equal only twice a year viz in the beginning of the spring and autumn at which times the sun passeth over the first point of aries and libra but at all other times of the year the daies and nights are unequal

it is called sphera parallela or a parallel sphere because the equinoctial being the same with the horizon all the parallels of the equinoctial are also parallels to the horizon in this sphere one of the poles of the world is the zenith and the other is the nadir and in this sphere the sun continueth above the horizon about half a year together and again as long under the horizon whereby the artificial day and night are each about half a year long
thirdly now follow the propositions wrought by the globe

to find the suns place in the ecliptick first find the day of the month upon the horizon and within upon the limb of the horizon standeth the degree in which the sun is this you may apply to the ecliptick upon the globe
to find the suns declination


first find the suns place in the ecliptick upon the globe and bring it to the brazen meridian

and there account how many degrees it is distant from the equinoctial for the declination of any point in the heavens is its meridional distance from the equator
the declination of any star upon the globe is found by bringing it to the brazen meridian and accounting as before
to find the right ascention of the sun

move the degree of the ecliptick wherein the sun is to the meridian and note the degree of the equinoctial which cometh to the meridian with it for the arch of the equinoctial contained between that point and the first point of aries is the right ascention that is to say it riseth with it in a right sphere
the right ascention of a star is to be accounted as before if the star be brought to the meridian
of the longitude as it is taken on the celestial globe


the longitude of the sun is that arch of the ecliptick which is contained between the first point of aries and that point of the ecliptick wherein the sun sun is but the longitude of a star is that arch of the ecliptick which is contained between the first point of aies and the section of the ecliptick with a great circle drawn from the pole of the eclipick through the center of the star being reconed

according to the succession of the signes
which to find
lay one end of the quadrant of altitude upon the pole of the ecliptick and the graduated edge thereof upon the center of the star and so it shall shew in the ecliptick the signe and degree of longitude
of the latitude as it is taken on the celestial globe

it is accounted in a great circle distant from the ecliptick toward either pole thereof therefore the sun or any star being in the ecliptick hath no latitude but the moon moon or any other planet being not in the dragons head north node or dragons taile south node or other stars being not in the ecliptick are said to have latitude so many degrees as they are distant from the ecliptick toward either pole thereof
which to find
lay one end of the quadrant of altitude upon the pole of the ecliptick and the graduated edge thereof upon the center of the star then may you see how many degrees thereof are contained between the star and the ecliptick and that is the latitude thereof

but if you want the quadrant of altitude then take a pair of compasses and setting one point in the center of the star extend the other till in the nearest distance it touches the ecliptick

and the compasses so opened and applied the equinoctial shall shew how many degrees the latitude is
here note
that the declination and right ascention of he sun and stars have respect to the equinotial but their longitudes and latitudes have espect to the ecliptick
to rectifie the globe according to the latitude of your place

elevate the proper pole so far above the horizon as the latitude of the place proposed moving the pole of the globe so high by he help of the degrees of the meridian
but to rectifie for the suns place is

after the former rectification to bring he suns place in the ecliptick to the meriian turning up the index of the hour wheel at noon
and to rectifie for the zenith is
after the first rectification to fasten the ut or screw of the quadrant of altitude at he zenith that is so many degrees from the quinoctial as the pole is elevated
to find the amplitude of the sun or any star that riseth and setteth


the amplitude is the horizontal distance rising or setting from the true points of east nd west which to find rectifie the globe by

the sixt proposition according to the latitud and bring the degree of the sun in the eclip+tick or center of the star to the horizon an therein see how many degrees it is from th
east or west
to find what stars do not set in any latitude

by the sixt prop rectify according to the latitude and turning about the glob mark what stars pass between the pole and the horizon for those if the nor pole be elevated are contained within th artick circle and cannot set for the artic circle as heretofore it hath been taken

drawn upon the north pole through th
north point of the horizon
to find the time when the sun or any star riseth or setteth

by the seaventh prop rectifie for th suns place and move the degree of the su or center of the star to the east or west pa of the horizon and then the index of th hour wheele shall shew the time
to find how the constellations are scituate at any time of the night

by the seaventh prop rectifie for th suns place and move about the globe till th index come to the hour desired and the hold the globe to shew the present scituatio of the constellations
to find the oblique ascention of the sun or any star that riseth or setteth

by the sixt prop rectifie for the latiude and bring the degrees of the sun or cener of the star to the east part of the horizon nd observe the degree of the equinoctial hich riseth with it for the arch of the equioctial contained between the first point of aes and the point of the equinoctial so asending is called the oblique ascention
to find the ascentional difference of the sun sun

by the third prop find the right ascenon and again by the thirteenth prop find oblique ascention thereof and subtract the ffer of them from the greater and the reain is the difference of ascention for the difrence of ascention is only the difference beeen the right oblique ascentions where ore that the difference of ascention is an ch of the equinoctial and is alwaies the ne of the suns rising before and after the of the year being considered
hereby


to get the time of the suns rising to a nute of an hour turn the ascentional difence into time allowing gr thereof to ery hour and to every degree minutes of hour and if the sun be in the northern gnes the ascentional difference is the time

of the suns rising before a clock if in th
southern then after a clock
again

having the time of the suns rising be+fore or after a clock you may get the lengt of the artificial day that is the time of th
suns continuance above the horizon if th
suns declination be north add it to if sout subtract it from and so shall come forth th semidiurnal arch this doubled giveth th length of the artificial day but if the lengt of the artificial night be required then wor contrary to that of the day
to find the time of the day by having the altitude of the sun
first by a quadrant or some other instrument find the altitude of the sun abov the horizon and then by the and pro rectify the globe for the latitude the su place and the zenith and bring the degree the ecliptick wherein the sun is to agree the same altitude upon the edge of the qua+drant of altitude and then the index of th
hour wheele shall shew the time of the day
to find the azimuth of the sun by having his altitude


the azimuth of the sun is the distan thereof accounted in the horizon from eas
west or south by the prop rect

fie the globe and bring the suns place in the ecliptick to agree to the same altitude on the graduated edge of the quadrant of altitude and then the quadrant of altitude shall shew his azimuth in the horizon
to find the azimuth of the sun at any time of the day

by the and prop rectify the globe and turn it about till the index of the hour wheele do point to the hour given then lay the quadrant of altitude upon the suns place in the ecliptick and it sheweth the azimuth in the horizon
at any time of the year to find the time of day break or beginning of crepusculus if any be

by the prop rectifie the globe and elevate the opposite degree of the sun at the west deg above the horizon and then the index of the hour wheele shall shew the time
having the altitude of any known star to find the hour of the night

by the prop rectify the globe and move about the globe till the star hath the given altitude in the graduated edg of the quadrant of altitude then shall the index of the hour wheele shew the hour required
having any known star at the meridian to find the hour


by the prop rectify the globe

and turn the globe till the same star comes to the brasen moridian so shall the index of the hour wheele shew the hour
of the poetical rising and setting of stars
cosmical
a star riseth cosmical when it riseth with the sun setteth cosmical if it set when the sun riseth
to find the time of the year when a star riseth cosmical

by the prop rectisy and bring the star to the east part of the horizon and observe the degree of the ecliptick which is at the east part of the horizon with it and then find in the circle of the horizon what day of the month answereth to the same degree of the ecliptick
to find the time of the year when a siar setteth cosmical

by the prop rectify and bring the star to the west part of the horizon and note the degree of the ecliptick at the past part of the horizon and find the day of the month on the horizon as before
acronical
a star riseth acronical when it riseth in the east and the sun is
setting in the west and it setteth acronical when it setteth with the sun
to find the time of the year when a star riseth cronical

by the prop rectify and bring the star to the east part of the horizon and note the degree of the ecliptick cut by the horizon at the west and find the day of the moneth answering thereunto upon the horizon as before
to find the time of the year when a star setteth acronical

by the prop rectify and bring the star to the west part of the horizon and note the degree of the ecliptick cut by the horizon at the west and find the day of the month upon the horizon as before
heliacal
heliacal rising of a star is the rising of a star out of the sun beams for then it appeareth before the sun rising though before it could not be seen by reason of its nearnes to the sun being within the arch of vision
heliacal setting is when a star cometh within the sun beams or when a star is entring into its arch of vision and then cannot be seen setting after the sun by reason of its nearness to the sun

the arch of vision is the arch of a vertical circle contained between the horizon and the center of the sun after it is set or before it riseth this altereth according to the several magnitudes

of the stars for the greater the star is the less is the arch of vision and contrary
the arches of vision belonging to the stars according to their severa magnitudes are these
to the first second third fourth fift sixt least to the planets
venus mercurie saturne jupiter mars
moon uncertain
to find the time of the year when a star riseth heliacal

by the prop rectify and bring the star to the east part of the horizon and note the degree of the ecliptick elevated above the west part of the horizon according to the arch of vision appertaining to the same star and then as before find the of the month on the limb of the horizon answering to the opposite degree of the ecliptick so elevated at west as aforesaid
to find the time of the year when a star setteth heliacal


by the prop rectify and bring the star to the west part of the horizon and note the degree of the ecliptick elevated at the east

part of the horizon according to the arch of vision belonging to the same star and by the opposite of it find the day of the month on the limb of the horizon as before
description of the terrestial globe
it is a round or spherical body representing the form of the earth and waters
on this globe are also described the ren circles of the sphaera armillaris viz the horizon meridian equator ecliptick the two colures with the fouer lesser circles viz the two tropicks and the two polar circles
besides these common circles there are described upon this globe divers other circles passing through both poles of the world these are called meridians or circles of longitude also certain oblique circular lines passing through the center of certain roses so called and these are called rhombs courses or points of the compasse

on this globe are described the known parts of the world divided into several quarters europe asia africa and america to which is added the unknown land about the

south pole called magelanica
and these quarters of the world are subdivided into several kingdoms and provinces as may be seen in the geographers
the zones
this globe is also divided into five zones one is called the torrid or burnt zone and this lyeth between the tropicks the inhabitants hereof are called amphiscii because they have two contrary meridional shadows in a year
two are called temperate and these lye between the tropicks and the polar circles the inhabitants hereof are called heterescii because they have their meridional shadow one way all the year
the two frigid zones are comprehended within the polar circles the inhabitants whereof are called periscii because their shadow at some time of the year goeth round about them
the inhabitants of the terrestial globe do also receive other names relating to their positions each to others
the antipodes are such as dwell diametrically opposite each to other have all things countrary as seasons of the year and times of the day

the antoesi are such as dwell so far remote from the equinoctial on one side as the other

dwelleth on the other side both under the same meridian
these have some things common and some things proper the common as to have their noon tides together proper as that the winter of the one is the others summer time and the longest day of the one is the shortest of the other
the periaesi are such as live in the same parallel of latitude toward the same pole and are directly opposite each to other both having the same meridian these have their summers winters and increase and shortning of daies and nights together but the night of the one is the day of the other
parallels of the longest day

besides the parallels of latitude formerly mentioned there are other parallels imagined to be drawn upon this globe which are called parallels of the longest day the first of them is to be drawn at that distance from the equinoctial where the longest day of the year is hours long the second where the longest day of the year is hours long the third where the longest day of the year is hours long through places increasing their longest day by of an hour till you come to the parallel where the longest day of the year is hours long which is under

in the longitude of the same place for the longitude is but the remotion of a place from the first meridian which passeth through the azores accounting eastwardly
to find the distance between two places put the center of the quadrant of altitude upon on one of the places and the graduared edge upon the other the degrees interjacent shall shew their distance in degrees and these may be turned into miles by multiplying by
to find how one place beareth or lyeth fro another
elevate the pole according to the latitude of the place where you are and fasten the quadrant of altitude at the zenith then bring the place where you are to the zenith and move the graduated edge of the quadrant of altitude to the other place and then the end of the quadrant of altitude shall fall upon the horizon in the point of bearing
to find what hour of the day or night it is at any place on the terrestial globe
bring the place where you are to the meridian and turn the index of the hour wheel to the hour it is with you at present then turn the other place to the brasen meridian and the index of the hour wheel will shew the hour desired
to find by the terrestial globe the quantity of the longest day at any place assigned

elevate the pole of the globe according to

the polar circles these being drawn each way from the equinoctial towards each pole divide the globe into unequal parts or spaces for though they be equal in time yet they agree not in equal distance of place but are greater or broader neer to the equinoctial and are narrower the farther they are from it
climats
a climate containeth two of the parallels of the longest day and altereth the longest day by the space of half an hour beginning at the equinoctial and are in all which end under the polar circles but the antients for want of knowledge of the parts under the equinoctial made at first but seven climates and called them by names but afterwards were added two more which made up their number to be nine
and these of the antients began to be accounted at and from the equator
propositions on the terrestial globe
to find the latitude of any place set thereon
bring the place to the brazen meridian and therein account how many degrees are betwixt the equinoctial and the place for that is the latitude you seek for the latitude is but the remotion of the zenith of a place fro the equator
to find the longitude of a place set thereon

bring the place under the brazen meridian and then the meridian shall cut the equinoctial

the latitude of the place given and bring the solstitial point of cancer if the north pole be elevated to the meridian and turn the index of the hour wheel to at noon then if you put the solstitial point of cancer to the west part of the horizon the index on the hour wheel sheweth the time of sun setting there and that is also the semidiurnal arch being doubled giveth the length of the day if it exceed not hours which end under the polar circle
but if the place asligned be within the polar circle then elevate the pole of the globe according to the latitude of the place turn the globe till some point of the vernal signes in the ecliptick touch the north point of the horizon and note how many degrees of the eclip tick are from the solstitial point of cancer for that number doubled giveth neerly the length of the day in our common dayes and these days may be turned into weekes and moneths

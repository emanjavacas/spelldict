IOHN GOVVGHE PASTOR to the Paryshe of Sayncte Peters in Cornebull of London, to the Christian Reader.
GRace mercye peace, from God the father, and from our lord Iesus christ his son, be with thee good Christian reder, and with all those that loue the lord vnfainedlye Amen.
Callinge to remembraunce the saying of Iesus the Son of Syrache in Ecclesiasticus the
Wisedome that is hyd, and Treasour that is whordyd vppe, what profyte is in them bothe? Thought it no lesse, then my bou~den dutye (after had perused this worke) to do my indeuor, that the same might be put in printe, whereby others might be part takers with me therein.
For after had red the same, and fyndyng therein, so heauenly doctryne, so consonant and agreynge wyth goddes booke, and so mete for thuse of all estates, and sortes of people (beynge christians) thought should do iniury to god, and wronge to my Christen bretherne, yf shoulde anye lenger deteigne the same from them.
And as knowe not the author thereof, no more founde any title or name geuen vnto the booke.
But for that the author tooke (as it were for his theame) the beginninge of the
The lyfe of man is a warfare vppon the earthe and hys dayes lyke the dayes of an hyred seruaunt.
Wherevppon he hath most lyuelye set before our eyes, as well howe we are incessantlye assauited and assayled, by the continuall flatteringe promyses of the worlde, the carnall allurementes and entycementes of our domesticall enemye the fleshe, and craftye temptatyons, and prouocations, of our olde ennemye the dyuell (wyth three ferce and cruell enemyes, neuer cease daye nor nighte to inuade vs, and what they can to prouoke vs, to fall from God) as also oure duties bothe in the resistence of synne, ad of cleauing to our Capytaine, and hed Chryste, and also by certeyne rules instructinge vs, as it were wyth a certayne armure and weapon, bothe how to beare of the sodein inuasions of those our enemyes, and also to repulse them, when they shall assayle vs. Wherefore that the name of the booke might agre with the worke, thought it good to attribute to the same suche a name, as the worcke desired: (that is to saye) godly and necessary rules to be exercised and put in practyse, by all Christes souldyers, lyuynge in the campe of this worlde.
And in the diligent readinge of this worke, and disgestinge of the same: thou shalte well perceaue (deere reder) that the lyfe of a very christian (of what estate or degree so euer he be) to exceade and far passe, the counterfayte lyues of cloyning cloysterars, of mummynge monkes, fonde fryers, or of hypochrytical heremytes, and that we nede not ronne to seke a strayte lyfe among the Chartrhouse monkes, for the parfection of a christian lyfe, but as ye same is most perfitly set forth in God his booke (I meane the sacred Scriptures) so it is to be followed of al Christians (yf we wilbe christians in dede) for it is not the name of a Chrystyan, that maketh vs Christians before God, vnlesse we haue also the dedes of Christyans, as Christe sayeth in Mathewe the
Not whosoeuer sayethe vnto mee Lorde Lorde, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doeth the wil of my father.
Why call ye me, maister Lorde, and do not that byd ye.
He that sayeth knowe him, and kepethe not his commaundementes is a lyer, and the truth is not in him.
So that as the name of a Iewe maketh not a Iewe.
Nomore doth the name of a Christian make a christia~ except we also shew forth ye workes of a christian.
That our christia~ lyues might shyne in puryty, in clennes, in sobryet, in pacyence, in charitye, in longe sufferyng, that the enemyes of the ghospel, seinge our godlye conuersation, mighte bee wonne by thesame to the ghospell.
Let your light so shyne before men, that they seynge your good workes may glorify your father which is in heauen.
And that they haue no cause iustlye to reporte euill of vs, folowyng the counsell of Seneca in his booke de morbus, where he hathe this pithy sayinge.
Haue peace with all men, but be at defyaunce with syn, (God graunt that this Heathen philosopher rise not at the Iudgemente, to condempne a nomber of vs Christians for oure negligence.)
So that now hope) it is apparant to all eyes that wil not wilfully be blynd: that it is the duty of al christians to liue so straightlye in this worlde, and so earnestlye to wrastle againste vyce, and sinne, as the weaknes of our fleshe shal or can beare in oure myndes detestynge and abhorrynge synne, and from the bottome of our hartes to wyshe that we coulde not sinne.
For it is our partes to wrastle against the same, and therein hath the holye ghost by his elect vessell Saynct Paule comforted vs saying in the
God is faithfull whiche shall not suffer you to bee tempted aboue your strength, but shal in the myddest of temptacion, make a waye that ye maye be able to beare it.
And what we are not able to doe, by reason of our weaknes, that hath christ fulfilled for vs, as ye same apostle saith also to the Romaynes the.
For what the lawe could not do in as muche as it was weake, bycause of the fleshe, that performed God, and sente hys sonne in the similytude of sinfull flesh.
And in the beginning of the same Chapiter he sayeth.
There is then nowe no dampnacion to them that are graffed in Christ Iesu.
What? to do what they lyst? and to ronne carelesly hedlonge into synne? Naye he addeth: Whyche walke not after the flesh but after the sprite.
So that the lyfe of euerye true Christian, oughte to be suche as no man worthely can rebuke: whiche thynge is moste pientifully, and at the full, set forth in this godly worke.
And thys write, onely to stoppe the mouthes of suche, as slaunderously reporte and saye that these newe preachers (for so it pleaseth them to tearme, suche as moste syncerlye preach Gods trueth) would haue no good workes, but preach lyberty, libertye.
Who (in dede) meane nothynge lesse: but bycause they seeke to plucke the~ from their fond trust in their vayn meritorus workes, taughte them by the papistes (thereby makinge Christe but halfe a Sauioure) and sette forthe the perfection of a trewe faithe whiche is most playnly taughte vs, in the.
of Luke by Christe himselfe, by the parable of the seruaunte comminge from the ploughe, whiche parable he concludeth with thys sayinge.
So ye also when ye haue done all that are commaunded you, say we are vnprofitable seruantes, we haue done y^ whiche was our duty to do.
And therfore sayeth S. Paule in the to the Ephesians.
For by grace are ye saued, through faythe, and that not of your selues.
For it is the guyfte of God, and not of workes, least any man should boaste.
And because, that we shoulde not mystake S. Paule, and thinke that the opinyon of faith were inough therfore we might be ydle, and liue careleslye, without desier or regarde of vertue, he immediatlye addeth sayinge.
For we are his workma~ship (saieth he) created in christ Iesu vnto good workes, whiche God hath prepared, that we shoulde walke in them.
So that it is most manifest, what impudent and vnshamefast lyers and slaunderers, the papistes their ad herentes are vpo~ god his preachers and his mynysters, for neyther they, nor none other at any time, hard any other doctrine out of anye of those preachers mouthes (whome it hath pleased them to cal new preachers) but thei and their doctrine (I meane the papistes) maye be called this dayes bakinge in comparyson of the auncienty of y^ doctrine whiche is taughte by those newe felowes, then this that haue aboue written.
Which in dede most aboundantly, and plentifully is setts forthe in this little booke: bothe godlyly, and learnedly.
Where by it maye well be perceyued, that though the tyme of darkenes hath bene muche in the world, by reason the same hath bene so obfuscated and ouer wheed with the dyrtye tradicions of wicked men, that the light, and puryty of god his ghospel coulde not shine: yet was it not hidde from all men but at al times, and in all ages, there euer haue bene some, that sawe and knewe the trueth, and left the same in wrytyng to their posterity, as appeareth by this little worke, whiche came to my handes written, and when had red the same, considerynge the antiquytye thereof, remembred the aunswere of God made to Elyas the Prophete
men in Israell whose knees, neuer vowed before Baall nor kyssed hym with hys mouth.
So that god alwayes as appereth (thoughe they be not taken of the worldlynges) hath his churche and people in the worlde, thoughe (in dede they be very few, and so haue alwayes bene (in respecte of the contrarye parte) and oftentymes exercised vnder the Crosse, and afflyeted by the worlde.
For if we should consider the estate condicion of gods church from the beginnyng of the world, eue~ vntyll our time, we shal perceiue ye same, alwaies to be very few in comparison of the residue of the world and that for the most part afflyeted) for anon after that Adam and Eue were cast out of paradice, Genes.
And after as the worlde increased, so did wickednesse habounde and synne wared rife, and God so put in oblyuion that.
yeares after the creatyon of the world (in the whiche the deluge or vniuersall floode came whereby all the world was drowned) there was no more found God his people, and God his churche, in all the worlde, but eight perso~s that is to saye Noy, his wife, his
sonnes, and theyr wyues which were saued and skaped the floode.
And after the floode was passed Noy and his housholde come out of the arke, the worlde beyng deuided among his thre sonnes, Sem, Cham, and Iaphethe, and that the people began eftsones to multiplye and increase, the worlde was so forgrowe~ in wickednes, that there was none found, that truely worshipped god, but Phare Abrahams father, and his housholde, as may appeare to the diligent reader from the.
of Genes. and after the death of Phare, god called Abraham from among the chaldeis least he shoulde haue him plucked from the true worshipping of god to idolatry which then was ryfe, among the Chaldeyans, and flowed also ouer all the worlde.
Abraham obeyed god his calling toke with him his wife Sara, al his houshold and Lot his brothers son, and so departed from Haram where Abrahams father dyed, into the lande of Canaan, which afterward his posteritie enioyed (after muche tribulacion) as from the
bokes of Moyses and Iosue, is plainlye sette forth, and at large dyscribed.
And so to see the whole course of the bible, from Abrahams comming from among the Chaldeys, vnto Moyses departure ute of Egipt, with the people of Israel, his rule of theym in the wildernesse, what trauaile and rebellyon he had amonges them, and so to Iosua who was there guyde to the promysed lande (in whose tyme the true and pure religion of god florished emo~gst them) and from Iosues tyme the manner of the gouernance of their common welth vnder Iudges, and from Iudges vnto kinges, and from kinges vnto priestes, after the captiuytye of Babylon, euen vntill Christes tyme.
And it shall be well perceyued that euen amonge the Iewes being gods peculyar people (all the world besides, being altogether geuen to ydolatry, and knowing not god) that God hys people were alwayes the least in number, and the true worshippinge of God was in very fewe.
And that alwaies the greater sort, and more in number were suche, as folowynge their owne dreames inuencyons, forsoke the true worshippinge of God, and with most cruelty put to death the professors thereof, and slue the prophetes, which tolde them Gods will, rebuked their sinnes and ydolatry as in the sacred Scriptures is most plentifully described.
Of syx hundreth thousande which came out of Egipte vnder Moyses, there entred but two, namely Iosue and Caleb, into the land of promis.
And when that Moyses (by the co~mandement of god, sent forth
of ye people of Israel (out of eche tribe one) to vew the promysed lande.
which were sent two parsons onely (that is to say Iosue and caleb) tolde the trueth and tenne of the twelue were lyers, and perswaded the people, from going into the lande, whiche god had promised.
Ye and such hurly burly was amongste them, that not onely Moyses and Aaron, but also Iosue Caleb, the true messengers were like to be stoned, and would haue made themselues capitaines, and so haue returned back into Egipt.
Not one of theym entred the lande (no more any rebellours againste God hys truth and his true preachers which are signified by Iosue caleb shal enter into our promised land, which is the king dom of heauen, purchased by y^ precious death and bloudshedding, of y^ immaculate lambe Iesus christ our onely sauiour aduocate) again was not Micke as ye prophet of god against
false prophets of Baall whiche promised Achab victory his affaires: but Micheas tolde him of his destruction.
and you shall see manyfestlye, the bragginge lyes of the false prophetes, against the simple true tale of Mycheas the prophere of God: and not onely thus in the olde testamente, but also Christ himself wytnesseth the same in the newe testament, saying in Mathew the.
Strayte is the gate and narow is the waye whiche leadeth vnto life, and few there bee that fynde it.
And christ calleth them his little flocke, saying in the.
Feare not lytle flock, for it is youre fathers pleasure to geue you a kingdome.
And saint Paule in the to te Romaines he sayeth.
And in the second Epistle to the thessolonians and chapter sayeth.
And therefore when Esdras asked the Aungell, whether many or fewe should be saued he made him this aunswere.
The moste highest hath made this worlde for manye, and the world to come for fewe.
Thus muche haue written to answer such as haue this reason in their mouthes, wil god suffer so many to perishe? and to be led blynd so many hu~dred yeares.
What shal speake of hundrethes of yeares? Was not the worlde from the beginninge therof vntyll after christes ascencion (setting the Iewes aparte, which were but a handfull in comparison of the whole worlde besides) altogether, not onely without the knowledge of god, but also worshipped dyuels and creatures, euery manne after his owne fantesy, some the Sun, some the moone, some the starres, some the fier, and some the similitude of beastes, and some of men, and as they receyued benefytes of men, so after their deathes, they worshipped them for goddes, as because Bacchus firste found emongst them the meane to make wine: therfore after his death they made hym a god (if creatures maye make gods as the pope maye sayntes) and called him the god of wine.
Mars first found out armure and weapon, when he was deade, they made him a God, and called him the god of warre.
Ceres a woman she first founde the meane, to plowe the ground and to so we corne, so to make breade (where before they eate accorns) and when she was dead thy. y^ made her a goddes, and called her the goddes of corne.
And so of other, as they receyued benefites by theim when they lyued, so gaue ther the names of gods vnto them after their deathes, and gaue them godly honors.
As Neptune was the God of y^ mariners for the Sea.
Pan was y^ god of the wood, Apollo was the god of wisedome, Iuno was y^ goddes for women that were with childe or in trauel.
So that they had for euery thing a sundrye god, whose ymages they worshipped, and their blyndenes ranne so farre that they worshypped duylles whiche were in Images and ake and gaue theym aunswers.
As the Image of Apollo in the yse of Delphos.
Yea, they killed their owne children, and offred theym vppe to their Images, thys wickednes, nd detestable ydololatrye endured saye vntyll after Chrystes assencyon (whyche was the space of fower thousand yeares or there aboutes) vntill Sainct Paule and other the Appostles preached the ghospel ouer al the worlde.
So that we must not take hold of oure faith by continuance of yeares, neyther prescryptyon of tyme maketh the thynge good, yf it bee contrarye to Goddes sacred Scryptures, haue it neuer so fayre a shewe.
And now ye see, how farre those fond reasons of worldlye wysedome, is from God, and howe quyte it is ouerthrowne.
And pray you how farre dyssented our Christyanitie from their gentilitye? They had for euery thynge a sundry God, we had for euery thinge a sundrye Saynct, we had S. Uncomber for yl husbandes.
Saynct Barbara for thunder, Sayncte Sithe, for our keyes, Saynct Anthony, for oure pygges, Saynct Loye for oure horse, Sainct Agatha for the to the ake, Saynct Leonards was good maister to theues, oure Ladye for women wyth chylde, and a number of suche abhominable, and stynkynge ydololatrye yea and because we woulde be nothing inferiour vnto them, we woulde haue for their dro~ken Bacchus, a dro~nken martin.
So that we hadde nothynge but the names of Christians, for in our rytes and Ceremonies, we were altogether heathenish.
They had for euerye thinge a god, we had for euery thyng a patron.
Their images spake: ours wer not dumbe, the craft of y^ diuell often tymes working blasphemous miracles bi them.
But now me thinketh heare some say, sir it was then a mery world and all thinges were then plentye, but sithens this new ghospelling came vp, all thynges haue bene verye deare and scarse, and we haue hadde a very harde world, forsothe hrein ye are the ryght children of your forefathers the idololatrus Iewes, for euen the same aunswere made they to Ieremy the prophet when he had rebuked them for their ydololatry in the
We will not heare the worde, which thou hast spoken vnto vs in the name of the Lorde, but we wyll doe whatsoeuer goeth out of our owne mouthes, that we maye sacrifice to the Queene of heauen, and bake cakes vnto her as we our selues, our forfathers, our kinges and Prynces haue done, in the Cities of Iudae, and in the streates of Ierusalem, and had our bellyes full of bread, and then went it wel with vs saw no misfortune.
And why woulde they not heare the prophet speaking vn to them? It foloweth.
But sithence we left to do sacrifice to the queene of heauen, we haue had scarsenes of all thynges, and are consumed with the sword and hunger.
The Gospell is not the cause of y^ wickednes y^ nowe raigneth in the worlde (far be it from euery christen harte to thinke so vnreuerently of that most precious Iewell the word of god) but our owne sinnes and wickednes, our exceding pride, oure bottomles couetousnes, our abhominable whoredome, our terrible swearing, our wycked blasphemye, our neglectyng of god his ghospell, our despisinge of his true prophetes and preachers, my pen is not able to write and describe the exceding wickednes, whiche nowe raigneth and floweth in Englande (Godde for hys mercye amende it, and graunte vs hartye repentaunce for the same) for the deuyll nowe so rageth, for that he seeth hys kyngedome, and hys eldeste sonne (Antechriste of Rome) lyke to bee ouerthrowne, therefore say, he nowe rageth accordinge to the saying of saint Peter in hys fyrste Epystle.
For youre aduersarye the dyuell walketh aboute lyke a rorynge Lyon, seekynge whome he may deuoure.
And for that he seeth hys dominyon and power to be nowe at the poynt of ouerthrowing because the laste day is at hande after the whyche tyme he shall neuer more trouble Goddes people, and therfore whilst he maye, he bestrreth him, and soweth hys wicked seede amongst menne with all hys dylygence, he leaueth no corner vnsoughte, no grounde vntryed, nor hearte vnproued.
And therefore (I saye) it is no maruayle that the worlde is wycked.
But as sayde before, so saye agayne, God graunte vs better heartes, and more feruente zeale bothe to repente our former lyues amendyng the same, and also to embrace wyth most wyllynge mindes hys holye ghospell, and the true Preachers thereof, leaste that be verified vppon vs whiche is spoken by the wysedome of God, in the firste Chapiter of the Prouerbes of Salamen, saying.
For haue called (sayeth the wysedome of God) and ye refused it, haue stretched out my ha~d, and no manne regarded it, but all my counsayles haue ye dyspysed and set my corrections at noghte Haue not wee played euen the same partes, howe haboundantlye hath God sette foorth hys trueth amongste vs, howe freelye and sincerelye, is it contynuallye preached amongst vs? But what carnall ghospeller amendeth his lyfe, what papyste beleueth hys trueth, or what heretique repenteth hys erroure, doe not we all (whilest euery man loketh on at others faultes, no man amendinge his owne) co~tinue still in our wickednes errors.
What will come of it? Hrke what the wisedome of God sayeth, euen in the next wordes folowing.
Therfore shal also laughe in your destruction, and mocke you, when that thinge that you feare, commeth vpon you.
When sodeyn miserye shal come vppon you, and destruction shall sodenlye oppresse you as a storme, when trouble and heauynes commeth vpon you, then shall they call vpon me, but wil not heare, they shal seke me earlye, but they shall not finde me. &c.
Can we therfore seinge we thus stubbernlye resist god his trueth? disobey his ghospel? repent not our euyls? nor amend or reforme our liues? looke for any other at his most righteous hande, but worthye punishmente and vtter destruction? vnles we repent.
therfore (in the bowelles of our Lorde Iesus christ) most earnestlye desier all suche, as loue god hys trueth, desire the preferment of his glorye, and do longe after the perfection of his moste holye and sincere religion, and the florishing therof, with the vtter ouerthrow of antechrist, and all his dirtye dregges, and sinke of deuelishe dreames, and filthye ceremonies.
As many (I say) as wishe the continuall helthe, prosperitye, and lo~g life, of our most worthy gracious soueraign lady queene Elizabeth (wo~ god long preserue amongst vs) earnestlie and with spede, to repente their former dedes, and become new men, both in lyfe, and worde, that God may blesse vs, and increase that hys goodnesse towardes vs, whiche he hath begon, that his enemies seing oure iust conuersation, may be won vnto god, and that we maye be one flocke, as there is one true shepeherde, and this shal we be, if ghospellers would folowe, the good lessons they rede in god his holy ghospel, and if suche as doe cleaue to prescryption of tyme, and number of people, would relynquyshe the fonde reasons of carnall wisedome, cleaue vnto god his truth, wherein is conteyned the wisedome of God, in which also is largely and sufficiently set forth, both how god would haue vs to honor him, and also what offendeth him.
Alacke why should thys tearme of forefathers, so muche stycke in our hartes, and so stubborely cause vs to resists the manifest trueth of god his moste sacred Scryptures, and as haue somwhat saide before, to stop the mouthes of suche as cleaued to number of yeares, and multitudes of people· So thinke it good to writte somwhat also of forefathers to aunswere those fonde people which haue these reasons in their mouthes, we will doe as oure forefathers haue done, what praye you (saye they) are we wyser then they, were there not as greate learned men, as wise menne, as good men in times passed, as nowe, and why then shoulde we not credit them, and do as they did? praye you lette me also aske you this questyon, yf the Apostles shoulde haue made christ that aunswer when he called them, if the Romains, Corinthia~s, Thessolonians, Ephesians, galathia~s, and all the whole world besides, should haue made the apostles gods messengers that aunswer (whiche they might more iustly haue done, if eyther contynuance of yeares myghte haue serued, for they had bene noseed in their gentilitye, aboue foure thousand yeares, or els if worldly wise and learned heades, for they had within that space rysen amo~gst them, Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, and a number of other wise, witty, and learned Philosophers) when they preached christ vnto them? Lorde, when shoulde the apostles or we haue come to the knowledge of Christ.
So that now ye see howe stronge a foundacion you stande on, which wil nedes stick to forefathers, that is so sone ouerthrowne and blowen vp, euen from the foundacion.
But because will not followe the steppes of your forefathers (whiche grounde themselues altogether vppon humaine reason, without gods word) wil also allege some scriptures against ye.
So that if ye may by any meanes be plucked fro~ antechrist (ye Pope meane al popishnes) will do my best, bothe now and at all times (god willing) to ye vttermost of my power, according to y^ small talent which god hath lent me, yet herein nothing but my duty.
So (I take god to record) do write this onelye because woulde (what in me lay) kepe you from oure enemy the deuyll, and to bring you to God.
Do not ye as they whiche were before you, and be ye not defyed in them, am the Lorde your god· kepe my commaundementes.
Thus sayeth the lorde, for thre and foure wickednesses of Iuda wil not spare him: because he hath caste aside the lawe of the lord, and not kept his commaundements, for theyr idolles haue disceyued them, after whome their forefathers went.
Whatsoeuer that commaunde you, that take hede ye doe, only vnto the lorde, and put thou nothing therto, nor take ought there from, and therefore sayeth Salomon in the.
The worde of god is a fiery shield, vnto al them that put their trust in him, put thou nothing vnto his wordes, least he reproue thee, and thou be founde a lyer.
So that now we see, that this reason of forefathers is cleane ouerthrowne, and nothing left vnto vs to folowe, but the sacred scriptures.
Yf this will not auaile, nor profit such as haue that fonde and vaine toye in their heades, knowe not what to say vnto them.
but may well allege the saying of see the prophet against them in the
Though shew them my lawe neuer so much, they acco~pte it but strange doctrine.
In dede such is the blyndnesse of the world, and of mans nature that they can not see the veritie without the special gyft of god, which is bound neither to Doctors hoode, nor yet to busshops myter, for the holy ghost sayethe in the first chapiter of the booke of wisdom.
Wisdome shal not e~ter into a froward soule, nor dwell in the bodye that is subdued vnto synne, and therfore he sayeth a little before in the same chapiter.
For he will be found of them that tempt him not, and appeare to the~ that put their trust in him, therfore saieth god by y^ prophet say in the.
Upon whom shall my spirite rest? but vpon the humble contrite spirite, and such a one as sta~deth in awe of my wordes.
And hereunto geue all diligence, in your faythe, minister vertue, in vertue, knowledge &c.
And then he concludeth, saying: If these thinges be with you, and be plenteous, they will make you that ye neyther shalbe ydle nor vnfruitefull in the knowledge of our lord Iesus christ, but he y^ hath not these things, he is blinde, groping the way wyth hys hande, hath forgotten himselfe, to haue bene pourged from his olde sinnes.
So that where those vertues be, there doth god in dede open his secre+ tes by his holye sprite.
write not this that meane therby to dyscourage any from learning, but rather exhorte all men to set their children thereunto, and speciallye to the vniuersities, whereby good litterature maye be maynteyned in the youth, whiche are the sede of the common wealthe of thys realme, and god his trueth syncerly preached.
But onelie inuaye against those papistes, whiche saye that suche learned men, as mayntayne their errors, are learned, they are Bushoppes: they haue studyed the scriptures, so manye yeares and so many yeares, and how can it be, but that these must nedes vnderstande the scriptures? Ye, and some saye, it is not possyble for anye man to vnderstande the scryptures, vnlesse he were a graduate of the vnyuersytie, but whether this impossibilytye be true or no, bothe the scryptures aboue recyted and also experyence in these our dayes (thankes be to God) dothe proue the contrarye, for that there be diuers whiche neuer came in the vniuersities, yea, and some suche as haue no more but their mothers tonge, doe vnderstande the scryptures, and able to teache good sounde doctrine.
But howe those men vnderstande the scriptures (whiche bragge so muche of their doctryne, and contynuance of theyr studye) by their doctryne is apparaunte, for seke they oughte in all theyr preachynges and doynges other then their owne praysynges, and stablishment of their own tradicions, yea, and extolling and preferringe the same aboue gods co~maundementes, as when papistrye raygned, howe little was the terrible swearinge and tearinge of god spoken against, howe was whoredome wynked at, which are vtterlye againste goddes commandementes, and by god his lawe punished by death.
But yet so litle regarded with them, that rather it was winked at then spoken against.
If a man hadde sworne neuer so great an othe in tearing of God, ye shoulde haue had that marke (the popes shauelynges meane) syt by and say neuer a worde.
But if one hadde sworne by theyr stynking idololatrus masse, by by Syr Iohn woulde haue bene busye, for so misusing his occupacyon.
Agayne, if one of their vowed priestes (repentynge his errors and minding to liue in gods lawes) hadde chaunsed to haue maried a wife (leauinge the takinge of other mens wiues and daughters forsakinge their liberty. or if a man had chaunced to eate a piece of rustye bacon for lacke of other meate (thoughe perchaunce M. person had fed himselfe and well filled his belly, with pyke, Carpe, tenche, and suche small fishe, and perchaunce with a piece of a custarde, and tarte and suche harde and vnsauery meates, vpon a fridaye or vppon anye other their forbidden dayes to Timathey the

Marye oute on him heretique fe vpon him he is not worthy to lyue.
So straitlye looked they to their dirty dreames, preferring and extollyng, the same (as much as in them laye) before gods commaundeme~tes, So preposterous was and is their Iudgementes.
(At such time as he sat kepyng his shepe in madian, when he sawe the bushe burne, and as he was goinge towardes it) Come not hither (sayeth he) putte thy shoes of thy fete, for the place wherein thou standest is holy ground.
Heare sayeth god, the place is holy, put of thy shs.
The chaly is holy (say they) put on thy gloues, putte of sayeth god, put on say the papistes, God ed Moises bare fieshe, better then his lether shoes.
The papystes estemed a shepes skin, aboue the flesh of man, redemed wyth the deathe and bloude of Chryste, for yf thy gloues were on, the matter was well ynoughe were the thinge neuer so holy.
But yf he happeyned to touch the same with his bare hande, Marry fye, what a sinne was it, it was maruaile if his hande hadde not otted of for it.
Yf this iudgement be not preposterous, and extollynge their owne tradicions, aboue God hys commaundementes what is preposterus? What is or canne be more plainelye· againste the manifeste trueth, yet all is done with a godly shewe to the eyes of worldlynges, with golden Copes, golden crosses, siluer sewsers, fra~kinsence burnyng before their idolles, with many other gay goodly thinges, surely the saying of christ in Mathew the· might well be veryfied vppon them, where he sayeth· Ye hypocrites ryghtly did Esay prophecy of you, sayinge: this people draw nigh me with their mouthes, and honoure me with their lyppes, but their hearte is farre from me, teaching the doctryne and preceptes of menne.
Therfore S. Paule willeth (as manye as be desirous to be very christians) by most manifest wordes, to eschew flye frome suche doctryne as is so infected, with superfluous ceremonyes, wythout the worde of God, sayinge in the.
If ye be deade with chryste from the ordinaunces of the world, why as though ye lyued in the world, are ye ledde with tradicions? touche not, tast not, handle not, which all perishe throughe the very abuse, after the commaundementes and doctrines of men, whyche thynges outwardly haue the similitude of wisedome, by supersticion and dumblenesse of mynde.
And by hurtinge of the bodye, and in that they doe the fleshe no worship to the nede therof.
Thus doth S. Paule by most euyde~t wordes pluck hs from the superstycyous rytes of the papystes, whose religion (in dede) is altogether in outward shewe and worldly pompe.
And therefore thapostle preuentinge the question whiche might be asked him by some worldlye wiseman, whiche woulde saye.
Why Sir what maner of lyfe woulde you haue vs to leade? after what sort would you haue vs Christians to doe and vse? he aunswereth euen in the begynninge of the net Chapyter of the same Epistle saying.
Yf ye be then risen againe with Christ, seke those thynges which are aboue, where christ sitteth on the righte hande of god set your affections on heauenly thinges and not of earthly thynges, for yeare dead and your life is hid with Christe in God.
Thus is it euydente, that the righte lyfe of a christian consysteth not, eyther in multytude of people, prescriptio~ of time, forefathers, nor outward Ceremonies, but onely in vertuousnes of life, leauinge our owne dreames inue~cions, and in folowing the sacred and holy scriptures settynge the same alwayes before oure eyes as oure onelye lodes starre to folowe, and touch stone to trye all doctrine by.
For whatsoeuer is not conteined in god his boke (I meane the holy byble) no Christian is bounde of necessity to doe.
Neither (as saide before) neede we to run in to any cloyster to seke a perfecte lyfe, seinge it is the dutye of all Christians (of what estate or degre soeuer he be) to lyue in the feare of God, and in suche sorte, as in this godly worke folowing is most lyuely and Christenly set forth.
So that in that matter shall not nede any thinge to entreat of.
Thus seking to ende my prologue, least be to tedyous, sende thee (good reader) to thys boke.
Prayinge God of hys mercye so to open our hartes to receiue his trueth and followe the same in oure lyuinge, that he maye (seinge oure repentaunce) poure his blessynge vppon vs, that hys true and sincere religion, nowe beginnynge (as it were) to springe vppe (but wonderfully hyndred in the growinge thereof, by gods enemyes the papistes, and carnall ghospellers, who haue the ghospell in their mouthes, but not in their conuersatyons) that it maye come to a perfect rypenes, that god be gloryfyed in this world by our christenly conuersation.
And that we (after this transitorye lyfe once finyshed) maye contynallye prayse hym, in the heauenlye habytacion wyth his holye aungelles world withoute ende, by the merites, death, and passion, of the immaculate lambe, oure onely Lorde and Sauioure Iesus Christ: to whom with the father and the holye ghost be al honour prayse glorye nowe and euermore world with out ende.
THE holy man Iobe, as apereth in the. vii. chapiter of his booke mouethe and prouoketh euery good man, dylygently to remembre that the lyfe of man in this worlde is nothing but continuall battell conflyct.
And that the moste parte of the people are greatly dysceaued, which so busely folowe the flatterynge prauities and pleasures of this worlde, and soo lyue in ydlenesse, as though al ieoperdy were passed, all thinges quiet in sure and substanciall peace.
It is maruel to see how quyetly, how with oute all feare, they slepe continually: Syth man is enuironed on all partes with so greate a multitude of ennemies, so crafty, so subtil, and full of disceites.
Beholde ma~, on euery side thou art in gret ieopardie and danger of death, ouer thy hed, the spirites of the aire with many crafty subtile waies busely waiteth thye destructyon, which diligently laboure, mortal ly to wounde thy sowle, with flaming dartes, with deadly poyson infected.
On thy right hande, and on thy left, before the, also behind the, this disceyuable worlde subtelly assaulteth thee, (the whiche as S. Iohn sayth, is vtterly set on myschiefe and viciousenes, and for that hated and enuied of god.)
This ering world in his assaultes, craftely, and polytiquely vseth him selfe.
For sometime he fu riously rageth, and in open battel inuadeth man, by much and great aduersitie, prouinge the strength of his soule.
Sumtime by blandishinge and fayre promyse he moueth to yeldinge, often times he cometh secretly vpon man to take him vnprouided out of armure.
Beneath the, that slipper and dysceitful serpent, the breaker of our quietnes, by many diuerse ingins lieth in waite to cause the sensuall apetite to fal to sin, which is that Eue by who~ this most false serpe~t first allured man to commit deadly sinne.
And yet as thoughe this were not sufficient so to be compa sed on euery syde with deadly ennemies: Man beareth also about him a familyar and a domesticall aduersary, then the whiche as no thinge can be more adioyninge or nighe, so nothinge canne be more daungerous, that is, that old and earthly fleshe, by longe and coutinuall acquayntance very familyare: but by mischeuous intent an vtter ennemy, of whome man can by no meanes be in sufficient suertie ne auoide the same.
Then sithe man is thus wrapped in so feareful and perilous battell and hath to meddle with so many enemies, so redy, so sworne in his distruction, so armed, so watching, so false and accustomed in battell: is not he very folishe whych armeth not hym selfe against the assaults, kepeth not sure good watch, hath not al thinges suspected, but so liueth as if al thinges were in quiet, and in good tranquylitie, nothynge regardinge, but the belly and the skynne, muche lyke as yf this lyfe were a feast or a banquetinge.
Suerly who so hath peace with vice, hath broken the truice whiche he tooke with god at hys baptisme.
And yet thou mad christian man thinkest all thynges in quyet, and criest peace, peace, whe~ thou hast god which is only peace and the authour of peace, thy extreame ennemie.
And when he by the mouth of his prophete saythe, there is no peace among these vicious people.
Truely there is no other condicion of peace with god but when man deadly hateth vice and strongly (by the helpe of god) fyghteth againste it.
For in case there be amitie and frendshyp betwene man and vice, then is god principal enemy to man, bothe for that he adioyneth him self to vice, which in no wise maye agre with god (for how may light and darknes agre) and for that also he performeth not his promyse made to god, but falsely breaketh his fidelitie, so faithefully promised.
Reme~bre christian man what time thou were baptised, thou promysed to be the true and vnfayned ser uaunte of Ihesus Christ, in whose quarell thou art twyse bounde to spende thy lyfe.
Seconde, that where thou were bonde and dead in synne he of his goodnesse restored the lyfe. remembrest thou not, what time thou first professed thy selfe to his religion, what vengeance, what maledictions thou desyred to fall vpon the, and that by expresse wordes with good delive ration, aduisement co~ceiued.
In case thou fulfilled not thy promise with hym, diddest not thou there promise to fight vnder his baner, and to haue perpetuall enemitye with sinne.
Consider what shame and rebuke commonly suffer they in the worlde which trayterousely forsake their naturall lorde, capitayne.
And yet thou christian man, fearest not to dysceaue thye capitayne Chryst, neyther reteyned with him for feare, seing he is God, ne yet for loue, when he for thy cause descended from heauen, and became man, whose name also thou bearest.
And that shuld ad monishe the of thy promyse made to him, and beyng false of thy promise, folowest thine ennemie, from whose captyuitye this louynge Chryst once redemed the with the raunsome of his precious bludde.
double traytoure, why doeste thou fyght vnder the standerde of thy aduersary, howe dare thou for shame kepe battell so vnkindly agaynst thy natural capitayne and louing master Christ, which spared not to spend his lyfe for thy re demption.
For as he saithe in the gospell of Luke, who fighteth not on his parte is agaynst him, and he that gathereth not with him, disparkeleth.
Alas christian man that thus fightest against Christ, the title of thy battel is not onely naught, but thy title also most vn graciouse.
Wilt thou know what rewarde they shal haue that thus forsake Christ folow the world? Beholde S. Paule declareth say inge, the finall reward of sinne is deathe.
What creature liuynge is halfe so madde to enter into battel be it neuer so beutifull and honourable in kinde, perfectly suer that he shulde not escape, but be slayne in the fielde: and yet thou christian souldiour regardest nothing to disseuer thy selfe from Christ, and cleue to thy enemies, surely know inge that thou shalte haue none other reward but onely death, and that of thy sowle.
Consider howe in this world, battels (which men kepe against men) the soldyoures valiantly, and freshly defend their capytaine fighte in his quarell.
Howe little they regard the losse of theyr goods and liues, some for hope of lucre, and temporall rewarde, some for feare they fall not in danger and the handes of their enemies, some because they wolde not be counted cowards and faint harted or dastardes, some to haue name co~mendatio~ of the world, and yet what rewarde haue these miserable people, for their so gret labours, peynes, and miserie.
Shuerly nothing but vain laude of their capytayne, increase of pos sessions and worldly richesse.
And we contrary, nother for shame, ne for rewarde can be moued halfe so valiauntly to fyght in the quarel of Christe, which not onely beholdeth vs in what maner we fight: but also will plentifully rewarde vs, aboue oure deseruynge.
And what rewarde hath he prouyded for them that manfully fyghte on his parte, not vaine ne transytory but such as neyther the eye can se, eare perceaue, ne the capacitie of man comprehende, and after this life ioye without ende.
And truely as he hath promised and prouidid greate and glorious rewarde for the~ that stoutly stand on his side: Soo to suche as forsake hym he hath also prouided like paine and punyshment.
Heauen is promised to them that fight in Christs qua rell, and yet (maruell it is to see) howe our courages be abated and nothing quickened with so hyghe promyses, specially when wee be sure that he that promysed vs the reward can not disceyue, no more then he can not be.
All thinges be done in the sight of him, which also seeth the inwardes of oure stomakes and hartes, and yet can no shame prouoke vs to forsake our ennemyes.
If we boldely withstande our ennemies, he shal com mend our vertue and constancye, of whom it is the highest felicitye to be commended: Why do we not then ieoperde our liues to obteiue this honour? He is very slouthful whiche can be prouoked by no rewardes, when feare and peril oftentymes causeth cowardes and dastards to be bold.
Furthermore in this worlde, battel is the most cruell ennemie, and he that moste intendeth mischiefe, can do no farther displeasure then take awaye the riches, and destroy the bodies of them whiche he ouer commeth.
But in this spirytuall battell the soule is vtterly destroyed and cast downe to hell.
The body is naturally ordeined to die, and yet how diligent we ar to auoide the wou~des of our body, howe busely seke we helpe for the~, and yet nothinge regardinge the woundes of the sowle.
Blessed god howe greatly feare we the deathe of the bodye, for that we perceaue it with oure bodely eyes, but for that we perceaue not the death of our sowles we thynke plainely it can not perishe and regarde it nothing.
And yet the death of the soule, is much more to be lamented then the deth of the body, for the sowle is more precious then the body.
Wyll you that declare you certaine coniec tures whereby you may perceaue the sicknes and deth of the sowle, when the stomake can not wel dis gest ne contayne the meate, then you wel perceue the body is sick.
As the material bread is foode of the body, so is the worde of god, foode of the sowle, whiche when it waxeth bytter and vnsauery to the sowle, then stedfastlye beleue the sowle is infected, and if the sowle contein not, ne perfectly disgeste the worde of god, then is it a plaine and euident argument that the soule is syck.
When the knees waxeth weak and the other memberes painefull and vnquyet then you know well the bodie is diseased: and doo you not perceaue the sycknes of the sowle when yt is slothfull and disdainyng towards the workes of mercie and can not beare a lytel infamy or rebuke of the world, and is sore vexed with the losse of vaine substance of temperal riches, when the eyes leseth their sighte the eares be destitute of their hearinge, the other senses lackinge theyr due operation, no man douteth but that the soule is departed from the bodie.
And yet when the eies of the soule be so ob scured with darknesse, that they can not perceaue the perfyt light which is veritie (the eares so stop ped by sensualytie) that they geue none aduertence to the voice of almighty god, the other parts destitute of their godlie felinge, beleuest thou then that thy soule is aliue? Thou seest thy neyghbour in great wreatchednes and myserye and hast no compassion on his heuines and trouble, so that thou be quiet and out of busynes, why doest not thou perceaue and feele his vexation, truly because thy sowle is deade, for that the verye life of the soule which is god is not ther for if god were in the sowle, there should be charytie, for god is charity, and thou shouldest haue compassion pytie on thy neighbour. for if thou be a lyuely and quycke membre of Iesu Christ (sythe we be all one bodie in him) how can it be that any part of the bodie be diseased and payned, and thou not only perceaue but sorrowe it also.
Farther another euident and sure token to know whether thy soule be lyuely or dead: Thou hast desceiued and falsely begiled thy brother in god, now hath thy sowle a deadly wounde, and yet thou art nothinge sorye for it, but reioysest at it as though thou haddest won great aduantage or lucre: Knowe for truth that in this case thy soul is dead, the body is not aliue, whe~ it can not fele a litle pricking, and thynkest thou that thy sowle is a liue when it perceueth not so gret a wounde.
When you here a man customably blasphemig the name of god, hautely and proudely dysdayning the dedes and behauiour of other, vsinge vncleane and fylthy communication, misiudginge and hynderynge the name of his brother.
The rotten and stinkyng carion lieth buried in the bo tome of his brest, fro whense such stinkinge and poysoned sauours a ryse, that they infecte and poyson all the hearers.
Christ in the gospell calleth the pharise is painted sepulcres: because they caryed in their freshe colored bodies stynking and dead soules.
The bodies of good and vertuous men be the temples of the holy ghoste.
The bodies of vicious people, be the sepulcres of caryons.
As Dauid witnesseth in the psalm: Their bo dies are great and open sepulcres for that they haue deceyued theyr bretherne and lyed wythe theyr tounges.
And surely there is nothing so dead as is the soule whe~ it fallith from Chryste.
Ne no carion so stincking in the noses of me~ as a deade sowle is abhominable in the syghte of god.
Then when dedly wordes procedyth from the soule, the soule must nedes be cary on and dead.
For Christ saieth as the harte thinketh: so the mouthe speaketh.
And surely yf the verye life of the soule which is god wer in the soule then should the mouth speake godly and liuely wordes.
The disciples of Christ as it aprethe in the gospell, sayde vpon a time to hym, lord thy wordes ben all lyuely, and the words of christ were all lyuely bycause they procedid fro that sowle, from the whi che the godhed neuer depart.
If the body be sycke it is by phisicke sone restored to his olde healthe, often times dead bodies by the instance and prayer of holy and vertuous men, be restoryd agayne to life.
But if the soule be once dead, nothing can reuiue it but only the louyng and mercifull goodnes of oure sauiour Iesu Chryst, which helpeth not ne restoreth the sowle to lyfe, if it in sinne departe from the bodie.
Furthermore the death of the body is shortely fynyshed, but the death of the sowle is euer lastinge, and when it is in maner more than deadde, yet in felynge of deathe it is immortall.
Then sythe oure battel is thus daungerous, what dulnesse, what Idlenes, what pokishenes of minde is this, nothing to regard ne feare so many ieoperdies and feareful perils.
And though we be thus on euerye side with enemies greuously compassid, yet is there no cause why, that other the greatnes of perill, the multitude of enemyes, their mighty and muche strength or dysceyuable doblenes, shoulde to much impalle or abashe our corage: for thoughe our aduersaries be very stronge and myscheuous, yet is oure louinge ayde and dyligent capytayne Christ more stro~g and myghty than they all.
For as Saynt Paule sayth, if Christ be of oure part who can preuayle agaynst vs: If he assist and help vs who shall ouercome vs, conceyue then a suere hope of victorye, and diligently remember that thine enemies hath in tyme past bin sore beaten, confoundyd, spoyled, and plainlie ouerthrowne of vs.
But by the might of our captain christ, of whom no dought (if we be faith full) he shalbe ouercome againe in vs: inforce and laboure that thou be of the body.
and in vertu pow er of thy head, thou shalt and may do all thigs.
Thou art in thy selfe very weake and feble, but in thy head very myghty stronge, and therfore the ende of our battel is not doubtful and vncertaine.
For asmuche as the victory dependeth not on fortun but is vtterly in the hand and power of god, and by hi in oure power and might also.
The gentelnes and redynes of our cartaine neuer faileth: make not thy selfe then vnworthy of his goodnes and fauour, and thou shalt ouercome.
He shal fight for the and accepte his liberality for thy merite, yet reason wold that thou refer the victory wholly receiuyd of hym.
Whiche fyrst and only pure from all synne, oppressed the tyrany of sinne.
But this victory can not be obtayned wythoute thyne owne diligence.
For he that saieth trust in me haue ouercome the worlde, will that thou be coragious and nothing slouthfull, and so through his help thou shalt haue victory yf thou fyght, accordinge as he hathe geuen ensample.
And therfore betwene too extreme ieoperdyes thou muste obserue and kepe the mene course, that thou to muche truste not to the mercye of god and doe nothynge, ne to sone geue ouer, ouercome with hardenes of battell.
ANd for as much as no batel can be maynteined without conuenyent armoure, thinke it necessari that we first know what kynde of armoure, is most fyt for euery christian souldier.
Then our armoure known that it be alway in a redines and at hand, least our disceytful ennemie (whiche continually lyethe in a wayte) take vs vnprouidyd, and so ouercome vs.
In this wordely battelles menne oft tymes be at rest and quietnes, the batel not parfectly endid.
But in this spiritual battels is perpetual fyght, no rest ne quietenes so longe as the sowle is in the body.
And therefore we must alwaie be in readenes, alway wakinge in armoure.
For our enemies neuer resteth, but when he is most quiet and fayneth truce, and she with as he wold flye, then is he most busy to doo most mischiefe, therfore the chefe and special care must be that the sowle be neuer vnarined, you see daily how deligently we arme and defende the body, what tyme we haue busynes or Iorney to be done, that we maye be more able to withstande all suche ennemies and troubles as maye fortune by the waye, shall we nat then much more prouyde that our sowles be in saftye, oure enemyes alwayes be armed and ready to destroy vs, and shal we by negligence, for slothe not be suere that wee peryshe nat? but as concerning the armure most nedeful for euerye chrystian soldier shall more specially speake in hys peculyar and proper place.
And in the mean season, som what generally to talke of them.
there be. ii. kyndes of armours or weapons most requisite for euery man that shall fight with the mischeuous company, or army of sine, which as S. Paul saith is praier knowledge or lerning, with the which he aduiseth vs alway with out intermyssyon to be suerlye armed.
Puer and vnfayned prayer bryngythe and lyftethe vp the inwarde affection to heauen, to the whyche oure enemyes can in noo wyse haue entraunce.
Knowledge and good lerning armyth and defendyth the vnderstanding of man with holsome doctrines and good opynyons and so neither praier ne knowledg may be lacked, the one so necessarily requireth the other, they agre so frendfully.
Faithful and vnfayned prayer, obteineth of god our peticion, knoledge good lerninge teacheth vs howe and in what maner we shall praye.
And what thinges we shall desyer in oure petycyons, whyche as.
S. Iames sayth be onlye suche as be profytable holsom for the soule, praier is the thing more commo~ly to be requyred whiche is famy lyar co~municatyon with god, but knowledge and good lerninge is no lesse profitable holsom or neces ry.
For cannot immagine how a man intending to forsake the co~mon course of the world, can surely and withoute peryll walke so longe and daungerous a iourney, vnles he haue the companye and felowship of the two most valiant capitaynes Moyses and Aaron.
Aaron for that he was the chefe preeste of the temple fygurethe in scripture praier.
And as knowledge and lerning without operacion lyttell or nothinge auaileth, so praier without know ledge is of smale vertue and efficacie.
Some men when they pray only consider how longe prolyx their praier is, how many oriso~s and psalmes they haue saide, thiking plainly the vertue stre~gth of praier only to consyste in longe and muche co~munication, thys faulte is speciallye amonge them whiche yet as babies cleue in the letter and carnal ceremonies and haue not the rypenes of the spirit.
But here what maner of prayer Christ in Mathewe teacheth vs, vse not saith he, much and tedious bablinge in youre praier, as infidels doth, which earnestly beleue that by longe and by muche spech they shall obtayne their peticion.
Couet not in this thing to be lyke ned to them, for your father in hea uen knoweth what is necessary behouable for youe, before youe make peticion.
And Paule in the xiiii. chapiter to the Corinthyans the ii. Epistel.
Muche more estemeth fiue wordes well vndersta~d with pure and cleane mynde spoken, then tenne thousande not vnderstande, and spoken wythe the mouthe only.
Moyses in his peticion vsyd noo wordes, and yet he was hearde.
It is not the noyse mouing of the lyppes that deferrith our peticion and praier to the hearinge of almightye god.
But onely the inwarde and feruent desyre of the soule.
Let this then be thy familiar vsage and custome, that when thine ennemyes moue the to vice, thou strayght and immediately lyfte vp thy harte vnto heauen with sure faithful hope, from whence all helpe cummyth, but thether also lyfte vp thy handes.
The sureste waye to auoyde the daunger of thy ennemyes, is alwaye buselye to be occupyed in pages missing] ly Manna waxe not vnsauery.
And if you thus with pure and cleane minde with reuerence and humilitie studie the scripture, you shall perceiue your selues maruelously rauished and transformed: and shall se in them the most pleasante deinties of your moste pleasante spouse: The haboundant rychesse of the enryched Salamon, the secret treasures of euerlasting wysdome.
Heauen and earth may peryshe, but the worde of god is uerlasting and shall not peryshe.
Men may lie and be deceiued: but the trueth whiche is god, neither can lie ne be disceiued.
And as for the expositours of the scripture, if you couet to be more liuely in spirite then redy to contention, if you intende the fatnes of the soule, rather then the quyckenesse of the wytte: labour suche auncient doctours whose good vertuous lyuing hath ben wel known, whose lerninge more plentiful and ful of fruite, whose speche neither leude ne vnsauery, and their exposition furthest fro the carnal vnderstanding and most fyt to the holy mysteries: The holy scripture of god hathe his peculyar language and proper figures, whiche must diligently be knowen.
Somtime she stutteth and as a louynge mother after our infancie she formeth her speche.
To littel babes and infantes in Christ she geueth milke: to them that be sicke and weake suppinges and brothes.
To the~ that be stronge more solyde, norishing and stronge meates.
Haste you to come from childhode and sycknes that you may eate strong and nori+shinge meates.
She boweth and enclineth her selfe after our humi+lity and febelnes.
But inforce you to arise and be strong accordynge to her sublimitye, it is very monstruous alwaye to be chyldysshe, and to much dastardnes alwayes to be lowest.
One verse well vnderstand with faithfull and good intent spoken, is more sauery and noryshing then the whole psalter not vnderstande and idelly redde.
And of this more often admonishe youe for that knowe this errour not only amonge the common people, but also among them which count them selues learned.
They here not what Chryst saith in the gospel of Iohn the. x. chapiter: The fleshely vnderstandynge nothing profiteth: The spirituall only geueth life: They regard not the sayinge of Paule.
We knowe that the lawe of God is spiritual not carnal, and to spiritual things spirituall vndersta~dinge moste be had and geuen.
In time past the pleasure of god was to be worshipped in the mou~tain.
If god hath geuen you a pregnaunt florishinge witte, continue not alwaye in the barreine letter, but hast you to the high secret misteries, and dilige~tlye call vppon god that it maye please him to open you the booke clasped with the. claspes, of the whych S. Iohn in the apocalips mencionethe.
The whyche booke none can open but he that declarethe the secretes of hys father, whiche neuer man knewe but the sonne, and suche as it pleased him to declare them vnto.
Then if you dylygently apply the knowledge of scripture, busily haue remembrau~ce of the lawes of Christ you shalbe sufficiently armed and defendid against all assaults and inuasion of your ennemies.
But he that entendeth profitablye to vse this godly armour must first cast away the armour of proud Saul that is to sai, the affectio~s of this worlde, whyche be more onerous then profitable, more hinderethe then furdereth him that shal fight with our greate Golias.
And after with pure and humble mynde gather oute of holy scrypture fyue sonns which thinke be the fiue wordes which Paule desireth to be spoken in good vnderstanding, and then arme thy ryghte hande with the slynge, for by these weapons onlye is our aduersarye the father of al pride mischefe ouerthrowne.
Whom our Capytayne christ by thi armour vanquished and ouercam, what time the deuil mouid him first to glotony, sith to auarice, third to Idolytrye: did he not with wordes of the said scripture abashe his proude courage vtterly repel hi~? Dauid also out of the holy scripture toke al his or namentes of battel, wherwith he ouercame the vncircumsised Philistyns.
Thus you maye see that holy scripture ministreth to euery Christian souldiour sufficient armature and defence to withstande the myght and subtell ingines of their ennemies.
which armour as Esay saithe is iustyce, equitie, humilite, charity, faith, and suche other.
Of the which Paul also speketh in diuers places of his Epistels.
As in the firste to the Corinthyans the. x. chapyter, where he callyth this armoure not carnall but spiritual, mighty and stronge in god, to the dystructyon of oure enemies, subduing filthy and idle cogitacions, and al pride and pre sumption against the knowledge of god.
Pawle armyd with this armoure as it apperithe in the. x. chapiter of the epistel to the Rhomains with an high corage saide, what shall deuide or seperate vs from the loue and charytie of allmightye god.
Ueration, hunger, lacke of clothes, Ieoperdy, persecution, prison, deth, as who sayth naye.
And in a nother place with greate corage he saithe, we shal ouercom and haue the better throughe his helpe which hath so faithfully louid vs.
For am certain and suer that neither deth ne life, aungels archaungels, things· present ne to com heauen ne hel ne other crea ture may deuide me from the charity of god, whyche is in Chryste Ihesu.
howe much trust confidence, how happy blessed auda citye ministred thys armoure of light to Paul, whiche called him selfe the abiect and outcast of this world.
Suche might strength such sure hardines shal holy scriptur geue you if you co~tinually and substancially labour them, and for your such labour and payn our capitain christ shal transfer you like a valia~t warriour into his glorious Citie called Iherusalem.
In the which is no mocion ne noise of battel but immortal peace profyt and sure tranquilitye quietnes.
The hedde of all wysdome is to know your selfe, of the two maner of wisdoms heuenly worldly, the one true the other immagined.
PEace is that highe and great goodnes whervnto the louers and folowars of this worlde refer all their study and labor, as to the moste perfit suer and quiet ende, but the peace of this world is not substancial and sure, but much deceyuable.
The phylosophers to muche assurid of them selues, promised this peace to the foloweres of their lerning, which thei might in no wise perform, for only christ may geue this eternal peace.
And to obtaine this godlye peace this is the onely waye to fight boldly with vice, and to hate youre selfe carnally, for betwene these capytall ennemies and our capitayne Christ is continuall enmitye and hatred.
For asmuch as god of his nature is very vertue, and beginner of all vertue.
The very filt nes gatheryd of all kinde of is of philosophers caled folishnes in holy scripture caled malis or frowardenes.
Contrary parfyte discresion, and sobernes, is both of philosophers and in holy scriptur called wisdom.
But hath not this folish frowardnes ouercome wisdome and sobernes? The capitain and father of mischefe and frowardnes, is the prynce of eternall darkenes.
Contrary the beginner and fountaine of wisdome is Chryste, which is the very light expelling all darkenes of worldly wisdom, the beauty of his fathers glorye.
The which as he hath made hym selfe oure redempcion and iustification, so as Paule witnesseth he is made oure very wisdome.
Wee preache to you saith Paul, Christ whiche for oure redemption was pages missing] fied, whom the Iues had in derisyo~ the gentiles reputed as a fole.
But to vs whom of his goodnes he hath called to his fauour.
He is the very might and power of god the eternal wisdom of god, by who~ we shal easely ouercom the malice of our ennemies.
Folow you this godly and eternall wisdome, and lytle regard the wisdome and policie of this world.
Whiche to folyshe earthely people so vaynelie and deceitfully bostethe her selfe, when as Saint Pawl saith ther is no more folyshenes in the sight of god, then this worldelie wysedome vtterly to be forsaken of the~ which intendith truly to be wise: and in a nother place he saith it is written, shall dystroie the wisdome of this worldly people, and reiectc the prudencie of these carnall prudents, wher shall then be these wise men, these men of aucto ryte and busy labourers for profit of this worlde? hathe not god distroyed the wysdom of this world plainly declared it to be very folyshenes? doute not but of these folyshe wise men and blind leders of blinde men, many shall rebuke you for that you fall from theyr condicions and worldlye appetytes, and folowe Chryst.
But they that thus rebuke you, be in name only christian men, in maners and condicions the very destroyers of Christes religion.
But take hede be not deceiued by their false glosinges, whose miserable blindnes is to be wayled rather then folowed.
For what extreme folishnes or madnes is this, in thinges very transitory and of no value to be counted craftye and wyse.
And in suche thinges wherein consysteth onely our wealth and helthe to be more folishe then bruite beastes.
Paule desire the that we maye be wise in suche thynges as be good and profitable.
Many be wise he saythe to do vngraciously: but they ca~not do wel.
And Hesiodus that pleasant poet iudgeth al such persons very vyle and nothynge profytable, whiche neyther be wise ne wil obey to suche as geue theim sober and wyse counsaile.
But what shal we then say to them, whiche when they be to shamefully folishe, alway continuynge in myschiefe and euyll, mocke and delude suche as haue risen from the darke blindenes, euil behauiour of this world and amend their life.
Dauid saith the skorneful parsons shalbe skorned, he that dwelleth in heauen shall delude them and god shall laughe at them.
It is much commendable to be discommended of fooles, and theim that be malicious and enuyous, And muche horryble to be mocked of god.
This beastely and deuely she wisdome saith saincte Iames is vtterly hated of god, whose ende is nothinge but deathe.
For this worldly wisdom as a handmaide foloweth pestilent pride and arro gancy, after arrogancy foloweth blindenes of reason, when reason is blindid then ruleth carnall delectacion and worldely concupyscence.
Then foloweth the company of synne and redynes to synne.
This propencenes to sinne folow ethe custome in Sinne, and after commeth dulnesse of mynde in the sowle.
So that the sowle perceiueth not howe great daunger and peril she is in, and when the soule is thus astonied and destitute of al godly felinge.
Then sodainly preuenteth death of the body, and co~sequently deathe of the sowle: for that he dieth impenite~t.
Here you maye perceyue and euidentely see that the mother and rote of al mis chefe is wordely and carnall wisdome.
But of the wysedome of Christe whyche the worlde reputeth as folishenes.
It is red in the xi. chapiter of Esay, wher he saith in the persone of those to whome this godly wisdom hath hapened, all goodnes hathe hapened to me withe her, and by her helpe great vertu and honesty, and haue reioyced in al my actes.
For asmuch as this wysedome was euer my guide and captain, vpon this wisdome waiteth continually humili ty and sobernes.
Humility maketh vs apte and mete vessels to receaue the spyryte of god.
For vpon lowly and meke parso~s his pleasure is to rest.
And after that of his infinite goodnes, he hath dis stylled in oure soules his. vii. speciall gyfts.
Sodenly rootith and buddethe in vs the plesant rype corne of al vertue, with their blessed and ioyfull fruits.
Of the whiche the chefe is a quiet and peacified concience with god whiche is called inwarde ioye, The secrete ioye, the ioye vnknowne, but to suche as hathe assayed and tasted it.
The ioye which vanishyth not ne can be taken away, as the ioye of this world, but groweth and in creasythe to eternall ioye.
This wisdome according to the aduisement of S. Iames, must by conti nual feruent praier be desired of god, and delygentlye laborid for· in the secrete vaines of holy scripture.
The hed and begynnynge of this wysdome is suerely and substancially to know your self.
The which prouerbe our auncient and forefathers hath honored and taken as the voyce of god, decsendi~g from heauen, and good authours delyted so much in it that they extemed the hole some and efficacye of wysdome to be conteyned in it.
But the saienges of Infedels and Pagans may be of smal autority among christen men, vnlesse they agree with holye scripture.
Here therfore what the heauenly louer in the booke of cantycles sayth to his spowse, threteninge and commaunding her to auoyd his house onles she knewe her selfe.
most bewtifull of all women, goe from me and walke the waies of youre fleshe or kynsefolke, in case youe know not your self, it is no trifle a man to knowe hym self, cannot well thinke that any man in this worlde can sufficiently be assured of the knoweledge of hys bodye.
Howe showld man then parfytly know the qualites and behauiors of the sowle.
Saint Paul whom it pleasyd god to rauishe into the third heauen and teache the secret misteris therof, durst not presume to iudge him selfe, which he wold haue done noo dought therof, if he perfetlye had knowne him selfe.
If so godly and perfit a man durst not affirme, that he parfitly knew him self, shal we carnalmen assure oure selues so boldly to the knowledge of our selues.
He is thought a verye vnprofytable, and vnwise soldiour, whiche neither knoweth his owne power and strengthe, ne the might company of his enemies.
But man hath not batel one ly with other men, but also wyth him selfe.
And suerelye the moste daunger of oure battell is contained in oure selues.
And oftyn tymes there is so smal dyfference be twene our frendes and our fooes.
That it is to be feared, leste we by necligence defende our foe for our frend, and hurte our frend for our foo.
Then forasmuche as this spirituall battell is moste withe our selues, and the first hope of victorie is to know our selues: shall breuely as in battell depeinte and to you, an Image of youre by the which you maye the attayne the knowledge of
MAn therfore is a certaine monstruous beast compact or formyd of. ii. or. iii. partes muche dyuers and contrary, that is to saye of the sowle whiche is spirituall and the image of god.
And of the body whiche is in maner a bruite and domme beaste: for in the bodely part we doo not excell the other kinde of beastes but are in al the giftes and condicions therof, muche inferyoure and worse then they.
But by the sowle and spyrituall part we be partakers of the highe godhed diuinytie, and in that behalfe not onelye excell the angelicall creatures, but also are adioyned and made one with god.
If the bodye had not bene addyd and anexyd to the sowle, man had ben all spirituall and godly.
And if the sowle had not ben geuen to the body, man had ben al beastely.
These two natures so contrary disagreinge, the highe workman and maker of all thinges ioyned and knytte together, in ioyful and quiet amitie and concord.
But the false deceiuable and crafty serpe~t. vtter and extreme enemye to oure quietnes, by mischeuous and vnhappy subtilti, set such enmity and discord betwne them that thei can not be deuyded or departed wyth out greate vexation and payne, ne continue and dwel together with out continuall stryfe and battell.
The body as it is it selfe visible, deliteth in thinges that be visible, as it is mortal and tra~sytory and of no goodnes, so it foloweth vain and transitory thinges, as it is he ye and ponderous, so it synkethe and slydyth alway downewarde.
Contrarye the sowle as it is in kynde heauenlye, so it alwaye enforsyth vpwarde, and contendyth alway with this earthely parte, dispiseth these visible thinges, for that it knowith them transitorye and of no goodnes.
As she is immortal, so she loueth thinges that be euerlastyng (for lyke hathe alway pleasure in thinges that be like (onles she be vtterly drouned in the filthynes and poyson of the body, and by them greuously infec ted, do declyne from her naturall gentilnes and clenes.
It was not the fyrst state and condicyon wher in man was created, that caused thys deuisyon.
But that whyche was formid and created good and puer, was by sinne corrupted and defiled.
And synne dyd sowe thys dyscorde and discentyon betwene them which were in quietnes and agreed as one.
For before man was by synne infected, the sowle without busines commaundid the body, and the body gladly and wil+ling obeyed the imperye and commaundement of the sowle.
Nowe that thys good order and quyetenes is distroubled, it is contrary: for the carnall affection striuethe and enforthe to haue preminence aboue reason.
And often reason by blyndenesse obeythe sensualytie, wherfore man maye well be compared to a faccious or sedicious ci+tie, which for as muche as it consistethe of dyuers kindes of men, diuersly mindid and disposed must nedes be troublid with diuers mo cions and sedicions, onles the hole rule and empiere bee in one, and that he be suche as will nothinge commaund, but that shalbe verye profitable and holsom for the com mon wealth and safty of the same.
And therfore it is very necessary in euery region and communialte, that thei rule which be most wise and discrete, and the other obey.
The common people for the moste parte be of smale corage and dastardes, and therefore they maye beare no rule, but muste be obedient to their rulers, and such as be nobles and auncient in yeares, in al assembles and counsailes must paciently be herde.
But the aucto rity and power to determine all things must remain in one which is called their kynge, and he must as time requireth, be admonished and aduertised but not compelled· ne haue in his realme superiour.
For the kyng ought to obey none but the lawe, the lawe presentyth the image of vertu honesty.
But if so be this order be inuerted and the wilde commons and troublesome dregges of the Citie in the common welth, rebell again their ruler, and the nobles disdaine the co~mandement of the king, the peri lous sedicion grudge growing, and if it be not holpen by deuyne policie, it fallethe to vtter decaye and ruine.
Nowe for our purpose, reason in man is a kyng and Emperoure.
Nobles and auncientes be certaine corporal affections or apetites, but such as be not beast ly.
As in example, naturall reuerence towardes youre parentes, loue and charyte towardes youre bretherne, beneuolence toward youre frendes and such other, and suche other affections as must discend from the obeysance of reason.
And in behauiour are beastly such be the commons and dragges of the citie.
As ryote enuie and suche other sickenes and disseases of the minde, whihe as bonde and vile seruauntes, must be kepte vnder, that they kepe dewe obedience to their kinge, and in no wise hurte him, and surelye if the affections and apetites sensuall do dewe obeisance and be orderid by reason.
Then shall man at noo time commit anie thinge that is euyll, or that after maye repent him.
And that knew wel Plato that deuine philosopher, when he sayde that they which oppresse and subdewe these carnall appetites, lyue wel and iustly, and they that be ouercome of them liuethe euill and vn iustlie.
Then the onelie parfitte waie and pathe to felicitie, is first suerely and substancially to know your selfe, next to subdewe the car nall apetites and to be orderid one ly by reason.
And this reason must be vpryght, hole, wise, not infertyd.
Parauenture it shalbe thought very harde to so lowe that haue taught.
But diligently remember that excelente and commendable thinges be all waye daungerous and difficile.
There can be no more valyant act the~ to ouercom thy self ne no greater reward than eternal beatitude and felicite.
Nothing is more happy then a trewe crystian man: to whom as a reward, the kyngdome of heauen is prouidyd and promysed.
If man only consider his own power and ablitie no thing is more hard then to subdue the fleshe.
But if he delygently remember that Chryst is hys capytayne and helper: to whom nothyng is vnpossyble ne vneasy, it shalbe very lighte in youre concience and mind, a purpose or intent of perfit life, and after busylye labour to bring it to effect.
the mind of man can not imagine so hygh noble a matter: but by feruent lalabour it may be brought to passe.
And that thinge whiche in the beginninge shalbe thought inuincible and muche harde to be done, shall in continuance be made soft, by vsage easy, and by custome plesant.
The way of vertu, saith Hesi odus is in the beginning straight daungerous, but if you crepe to the top nothing is more suer ne in saty.
There is no beaste so cruell ne outrage, but by mans dilige~ce labour may be tamed and made meke.
Shall man thynke then that no meanes maye be found to bridle the affections and apitites sensuall.
What payne dothe man take to be deliuered from sycknes and diseases of the body.
And shal he take no payne to be delyueryd from eternal dampnation, both of body and soule? Suerly it is to be lamentyd that many whiche bearith the name of Christ, like brute and dome beastes folow in their uing the beastly and sensual appetites, and are in maner bound and seruauntes to them.
So little exercised in this spyrytuall battell that they know noo difference betwixt reason and sensuality.
Thei exsteme that only to be man which they see, perceaue, and feele.
This call they peace safty althoughe it is most miserable bo~dage.
When reson resisteth not the carnall mocions: But perswaded and blinded by their intisings foloweth them.
This is that miserable peace whi che Christe authour of trewe and parfite peace came to dissolue and set healtheful battel betwene the father and the sonne, the wife and the huseband.
And brefly betwixt al suche thynges as the vnsure amitie of this worlde hath ioyned and knyt together.
Let the auctoritie of philosophersbe of smale estimation vnles the same sentence (thoughe in other wordes) be expreslye spoken in holye scripture.
Paule sometime the spirite, some time the inwarde man, sometime the lawe of the minde.
That they cal the affections, he calleth sometime the flesshe, sometyme the body, somtime the exterior man and the lawe of the membres.
Sayenge in one place walke after the spirite and ye shall not committe the desyres of the flesshe: For the fleshe desyreth against the spyrite, and the spirite against the flesshe.
If you lyue after the fleshe ye shal die: but if you mortifie and subdue the deedes of the fleshe you shall liue.
Suerly it is a strange thynge and a newe alteration, that peace shoulde be soughte in battell: and battell in peace, life in deathe, and death in lyfe, libertie and fredome in seruitude and bondage: And bondage and seruitude in libertie and freedome.
And of libertie in an other place, if we folow the leading of the spirite, we are not vnder the bondage yoke of the lawe.
perceiue a law in my membres retynge the lawe of my mynde, and aboute to brynge me in thraldome vnder the lawe which is in my membres.
It is red also of the exteriour and interiour man.
Plato put two soules in one man: And Paule in the same manne putteth two men, soo annexed and ioyned together, that the one can not be without the other, neither in ioye ne in payne.
And againe they be so disceuered and deuyded, that the death to the one is life to thother.
And to this also maye be referred that he wryteth to the Corynthyans, sayenge.
The fyrst man was made a lyuing soule, the seconde a quickeninge or geuinge life.
The spiritual part was not first made, but the beastely: The first manne was of the earth earthely, the seconde of heauen heauenly.
And this speak welbelouyd, for that neither the fleshe ne the bloud shal possesse the kingedome of heauen, neither thinges corruptible or incorruption.
Here you maye euydently se that what Paule in one place called the exteriourman and the fleshe whiche is corruptyble: In another place he calleth it the earthely Adam.
And suerlye this is the same flesh, the same body of death, where with he was troubled when he sayde.
vnhappye creature, who shall delyuer me from the body of this death? And of the fruites bothe of the spiryte and of the fleshe, whiche be muche diuers, he writeth saieng.
He that soweth in the flesshe shall gather corruption of the flesshe.
And he that soweth of the spiryte shall of the spirite gather euerlasting life.
happy and fortunate manne in whom this earthelie Adam is so mortified and subdewed that it in no wise resysteth the spirite.
But whether this perfecte quietenesse and tranquilitie maye fortune to any man in this worlde wil not affyrme.
For Paule in this lyfe not withstandinge his hyghe perfection and grace, had a mocion of the fleshe to vexe and dystrou ble him.
And when he thryse desired god to be delyuered from the sayde mocion.
Paule my grace is suf ficient, for vertue is made perfite by vexation.
Paul was vexed by pryde, that he shuld not be proud.
To be perfit and strong in god, he was caused to be weake and feeble.
For he caryed the treasure of heuenly reuelation in a frayle and bryckell vessell. that the honoure and victory shulde onely be in the power and mighte of God, not in him selfe.
This one exaumple of Paule is erudition and learninge to vs in many things.
First when we be moued and tised to syn, that we diligently cal to almighty god by prayer.
Furthermore that to trewe christian men temptations be not only profitable, but also necessary for the preseruation of ver tue.
Finally that when all the other motions be subdued, then the mocions of pryde and vayneglorye are most to be feared, which in the myddes of vertue, priuelye awayteth vs. After that man hath mortifyed the flesshe and subdued the concupicence of the same.
The~ shal he se god and tast god that he is swete.
God is not seene in the fierce and boisteous winde of temtacion, but after man hath resisted and valiantlye oppressyd the suggestions of his ennemies: Then foloweth a delectable smale blaste of ghostly comforte and consolacion.
Which when you shal perceue, then quikly awayt with your inwarde eyes, and you shall se god well knowe that he hathe made safe for you.
Of the thre partes in man the spiryte, the sowle, and the fleshe.
These myght be thought more then sufficient: but that you maye the more playnlye knowe, what man is.
shall brieflye declare vnto you, what deuision Oxygen maketh of man.
And to be shorte he maketh three partes in man.
The body or the fleshe as the lowest parte of man, in the which by the offence of the firste parente Adam, the cruell and subtyll serpente the deuyll sowed the lawe of synne into the sowle of man.
By the which he is prouokid to sinne, ouercome by the deuill and bonde in sinne.
The spirite by the which man dothe expresse the very similitude of the nature of god.
In the which also the highe creatour and maker of al thinges out of the inwarde secretes of his minde with his own finger, that is to say his spirite, dyd write the eternal law of vertue honestie.
By this portion also Man is adioyned, and made one with god.
After these he putteth the thyrde parte as a middle or a meane betwene the. other, which is a receiuour of the naturall meuinges or felynges.
This parte as in a factious or sedicious cytie, is moued and intysed of both partes, and is at libertie to whether it wyll encline.
If it forsake the fleshe and folow the spirite, then shall it be spirituall: But if it followe the desires and upidities of the fleshe it shalbe al so fleshely.
Know you for trouthe, that he that cleaueth to an harlotte is made oone body with her: and he that cleaueth to god is made one spirite with him.
This harlot is the slipper and vn stedfast parte of man, which is the fleshe.
Of whom it is spoken of in the seconde booke of Prouerbes, withdrawe the from the strange woman whiche maketh her wordes softe, and forsaketh the capytayne page duplicate] page duplicate] of her youthe, and hath forgotten the couenaunte shee made with god.
Her house is al deadly, her pathes bryngeth to hel.
They that folowe her shall not obteyne the pathe of lyfe.
Then the spirite maketh manne godlye, the fleshe maketh beastely: The soule maketh man liuynge, the spirite good and vertuouse, the flesshe euyll and vngracious: the soule ma keth neither good ne euyl: the spirite seketh heauenly thynges, the fleshe swete and pleasaunte.
The soule necessary: the spirite lyfteth to heauen, the fleshe depresseth to hel.
The soule of the spirit or flesh taketh merite or demerite, what so euer is fleshely is vicious, that which is spiritual is parfite, that which is of the soule is mean and indifferent, will you that more playnly discriue to youe the difference betwixte these partes.
You honoure and feare your parentes, you loue youre chyldren and frendes, it is not so muche ver tuous to do these thinges as it is sinne not to doe them.
For whye should not you beynge a christian man do those thinges which infidels and beastes doo, onely by instinct of nature.
That which man dothe of nature is not worthie rewarde.
But it so chauncith that other you must not regard the reue rence towardes youre parentes, neglecte dispyse the loue of your children, or els displease god.
In this case what is to be done, the sowle is in dought, the flesshe mouithe in the one side, the spirite in the other.
The spirite perswadeth that god is better then thy father, and more to be regardid, the fleshe contrary maketh suggestion.
You owe your parentes your naturall being? And in case you obey them not you shalbe disheritid and com mo~ly called vnnatural vnkind, lose not your goodes, disteyne not your name, as for god other he seethe not or he wil not see, and at the leaste he wyll sone be pleased.
Nowe the soule is in doubte and standethe amasyd: if it inclyne to the flesshe dispise the spirite it is one bodye with it.
And if it folow the spyryte it is transmutyd in to the spirite.
It is great erroure to exteme that absolute vertu, which is of nature.
Some of nature, are little moued or intised to the pleasures of the bodye.
Let them not iudge the~ selues verteous for that which is indifferent.
For the laud of vertue consistith not in lacking of this pleasure: but in subduinge the mocions therto.
Certain affections outward, and in kind good honest, cloked and coueryd with countenaunce of vertu.
Some haue pleasure in fastinge, some in many prayers, manye suche like.
But let these be done in symple and pure spyryte, for if thei be vsed for name, vaynglory, or any profit of y^ body, thei smel of the fleshe.
Let no man for vsing of these mean thyngs think him selfe better then other ne condemne theim that vse the~ not, but dilige~tly in him self consider whether the vsage of these thinges be carnall or no.
Your brother in god is in necessety nedeth your helpe and comfort, you contineu in your praiers and mumble your beades and mattins and will not knowe his necessitie and trouble.
These praiers god shal despise, for howe shall god geue aduertence to thy praiers, when thou being man, re gardest not the peticion of man.
For so doth vnchriste~ men also, or els you loue them for their beuty or contentacio~ of your mind: Nowe is your loue carnal.
But if you loue them for that you perceue in the~ the image of chryst, as piety, sobernes, constancie and suche other vertues.
Nowe youe loue them not in them selues but in Christ, and so your loue is spirituall, but of these thinges shall speake more in a nother place.
NOwe for as much as haue declared opened a certayne plain and grosse way to vertue.
shal briefly write you certaine rules, by whose co~duct you maye wt more ease crepe out fro~ the bli~d er+rours of thys worlde to the pure light of the spritual life: in maner as Dedalus dyd out of the daungerous laborinth, by the conducte of a thred.
And to al those that di+ligently vse and exercise them self in this lerninge of vertue.
That spyrite which prouithe all godlye purposys and intentes, shall sende ayde and comforte.
But suche as saye go from vs we wil not of thy lerninge.
The mercy of god shall reiecte because they reiect his ler+ning and knowledg.
These rules whiche intende to wryte shall be taken partly of the personages of god, the deuill, and the flesshe, partelye of vertue and vice.
And such thinges as be annexyd to the~ partly of the matter of vertu and vice, for these shalbe moste necessary agaynst the thre principal euylles, the remanent of origynall synne.
For thoughe the vertue of baptisme hath washed awaye the poyson and infection of synne: yet there remayneth a certayne thing of the olde dissease, whiche is aptnes and redinesse to sin left in vs, bothe for the saue garde of humylitie, and more increase of vertue.
These three principall euylles be blindnesse, the fleshe, and infyrmitie.
Blyndenesse with the darcke cloude of Ignora~ce, obscureth the iudgement of reason: for that most pure lyghte of the visage of God, whiche the offence of our fyrst father dyd make muche darcke, corrupte education, outragious com pany, froward affections, custom of synne, hath soo ouercome with ruste and canker, that kante any lawe of god by deuyne power gra uen in the soule of Man, doth appere.
Then as began blindnesse causeth that in choyse of thynges we gretly be disceiued, folowing such thinges as be worst, in stede of them that be beste: lesse regardyng thinges of great profyte the~ vtterly vnprofytable.
That in case ma~ parceiue what thynge is beste, yet he shall loue the contrary.
Infirmitee or weakenesse causeth man to leaue the way of vertu, ouercome other by werynesse, or by temptacion.
Blindnes hurteth the iugdement of reason, the fleshe corruptith the wille, infirmitie breaketh consta~cye and stedfast intente.
Therfore the fyrst remedy is to know difference betwixte good and euil, and in this blyndnesse muste be taken awaye, that Man stumble not in choise of thinges.
And in this the fleshe muste be subdued, that contrarye to the iudgement of Reason, he loue not the pleasaunt thynges more then holsom.
Third that after he hath begunne a waye to vertue, he shal continue, and in this the infirmity muste be vnderset and vpholden, that he forsake not the way of ver tue, wythe more rebuke then if he had not entryd into it, ignorance must be holpen, that man may see which waie to goo: the fleshe must be mortified and tamid, that it carye not man oute of the knowne waie.
The wekenesse or infirmitie of man must be coragyd boldid, that after man hathe euteryd into the straite and narrowe waie of vertue, he wauer not, ne fiyppe backe, but ioyfullye go forwarde vnto the time that he obteyne the wager and crowne promysed to them, which sredfastly continue in this iorneye, and to these three shall appoynte certayde rules as hereafter foloueth.
ANd for asmuch as faith is only gate entrance to Christ.
The first rule shalbe that you alwaye thincke and iudge the beste bothe of Christ, and his holy spcripture.
And that you beleue not with the mouthe onely, fayntely and faynedly as many dothe, but with all thy harte, suerly and stedfastly knowing, that ther is no prick ne title in holye scripture, whiche doth not greatly parteine to your healthe.
And be not abasshed for that you se the moste parte of men liue so as thoughe heauen and hel were triflinges, inuented and im magined onelye to feare or please chyldren: but surely perswade to your self, that god can not lie, and that all thinges shall happen, as he hath saide.
Consider howe mar uelous thynges and farre aboue the capacitie of man, the Prophetes prophesied of Christ, and they be all fulfilled and come to effect.
Blessed god what madnesse is it to thincke that he which hath not deceiued in these prophesies, shall deceyue in other thynges.
The prophetes haue not lyed, and shal Chryste the lorde of al prophetes lye· If you wolde with these and such other cogitacions, sometime excyte and styr the flame of Faith, and then desirouslye praye god to increase his faithe, maruel if he can longe continewe in euill.
For who in this world so mischeuous vngracious, wil not desist from vice, if he perfitely beleue that by vsage and custome of sin, not only trouble and vexacion of concience: but allso eternall dampnacion is gotten.
Contrary that vertuouse and good men for temporal paine and punishment, shal haue in this worlde puer and quiete conscience and after this lyfe ioye immortal.
The seconde Rule not to enter the way of saluation slouth fully or fearefully.
LEt this therfore be fyrst and principall, that you nothing dought of the promises of god.
Nexte that you enter not the way of saluacion slothfully or fearefullye.
But with a stedfast purpose, with all your harte, with bolde coragious mind, redy to lese both goodes and life in Christes cause.
They shall not possesse the kingdome of heauen, but such as valiantlye fyght and uffer for Christes sake, shall obtaine it.
Suffer not the affectio~ towardes kinsefolke, hinder you in this iorney.
Let not the flatteringe mocions of this world, reuoke and cal you backe.
The chayne of worldely businesse muste be cut asonder, for it is so knottyd that it is very harde to be vndone.
This confusyd Egipte must vtterlye be forsaken, that we in no wise turne our minde and soule to the pottes of fleshe which be the carnal affectio~s, and pleasurs.
The prophet cryeth fle from the myddes of babylon, and that with hasty spede, onles you wyll peryshe, but many slowely dothe fle from vyces, and fynd many causes to tary, saying, that after haue performyd and endyd such and suche busynes, and waxe somwhat more in age, then shall apply to vertue and intend it busyly.
folyshe man what if thy soule thys night be taken fro~ the? Knowest thou not, that one busines brengith a nother, vice growithe of vice? Folow therfore vertue quyckly, and in conuenient seaso~.
In other thinges take good auiseme~t, but here make al spede.
Counte not ne ponder not in your mynde, what and howe muche ye haue forsaken for Christ, beynge well assured that he shall suffycyently satisfy and recompence for all.
Be bolde vtterly and holye to co~myt your self to christ, mystrust yourselfe, and fullye trust in him, and he shall receaue you, caste all your care and thought to god and he shall norishe you.
And then you shall saye with the prophete, god hathe bene my guyde, and haue wantyd nothing, he hath set me in plentiful pasture, and hath refresshed me with the water of refectio~ and conuerted my sowle.
Deuide not your self in two partes to god and to the deuyll, for no man may serue. ii. masters of so contrary ap petytes.
God disdaineth them which halt on both legges that is, which wold liue after the world, and please god also.
He hateth them which be neither hot colde, but fainte and meane.
He is in great ielosie ouer our soules he wyl possesse all that him selfe, whiche he hathe redeemyd wyth his bloude.
He wyll haue no feloshipe withe the deuill, whome by his death he once ouercam.
One whyche by folowing the carnall and sensu all appetites, bringeth to deathe.
The other whiche by mortification of the flesh, leadith to lif.
Who so euer intendith to inheryt life, must walk the narrow and strait way which Christ walkid, and al that fro the begynnyng of the worlde pleasyd god.
He that wyl liue with christ, muste be crucifyed in thys worlde with Christ.
But many folyshely flatter them selues, and fondly in so weighty a matter deceiue them selues by lewde and vnwise opinyons.
Some saythe am noo preste, am a lay man, and a man of the world, and therfore must nedes occupye the wordle.
Other saye agayne, though be a preste am no man of religion, this ma ner of perfection is fit for them.
The religious man also hath sum what to flatter him selfe, saieng, though be in religion, yet am not of so strayghte religion, as other bee.
Some also saye am young, a gentylman borne, am rich, am a courtier, a noble man or a prince.
The sayinges of the a postelles partain not to me.
serable creature and blynde man, pertainethe it not to thee to liue with Christe? If thou be of this worlde, thou art not of Christ.
If thou call the worlde heauen and earthe, the ayer and the sea, then euery creature is of the worlde.
But if thou call the world ambycion, voluptuousnes, auerice, malyce, pleasures of the body.
Then saye to thee, if thou be of thys world, thou art no chrysten man.
Christ sayd indiffrently to al men, he that takyth not vpon hym hys crosse in this world, that is to say he that subduethe not the flesshe foloweth not me, shal not enter in to heuen.
If you desyre not to liue with Christ, then the mortefying of the fleshe pertaineth not to you: To be crucified in this world par teyneth not to you, yf to liue with God parteyneth not to you.
If you desire not to raigne with him in his glorye Chrystes humilitie, pouerty, tribulation, re bukes, laboures, wordes, and pas sion pertayneth not to you.
If his kyngdome pertayne not to youe, what fondnesse is this to desire re warde commonly with other: and wyll take no paines ne laboures with other? What blyndenesse is it, to desyre to raigne and to haue ioye wyth the hed, and wyll take no payne with the hed. Regarde not my good frend what other do, and deceue not your self by compa rison with them, it is a hard matter and fewe people knewe, what it is to be dead to sinne, to be dead to the carnal appetites, to be dead to the worlde.
And yet it is the thing wherunto al christian men, hathe professyd, and bounde them selues solempnely, at theyr baptisme.
Other we muste dye wyth out exceptyon, or els walke the waye of vertue, whether we be of highe or lowe degre.
And though all men can not attayn the perfyt imitacion of the hed that is christ, yet euerye man muste do what he can to attayn it.
He hath obtained a gret part of chrystianity, which with stedfaste mynd purposyth to be a trew and perfit christen man.
The thirde Rule prouethe that the waie of Christe is most profitable, besides that it onely leadeth to felicitie.
BUt that the waye of vertue doe not feare you, for that it semith sharpe, bytter, troubelous, lackinge the commodities of this world, and full of battel and strife with the thre principal enemies, the fleshe the deuil and the world, this shalbe the thirde rule, by the which you shall well knowe that the waie of Christe besides that it leadeth onely to felicite, is of all other most commodious and profitable, the reward not spoken of.
For what kynde of liuynge after this worlde maye man chouse, in the which he shal not suffer many sharp and bitter stormes.
The life of courtiers euerye man knoweethe is full of wretchednes, vnles he be verie folish and of no experience.
Immortall god howe longe and miserable seruitude suffer thei which liue in the court, what pain trouble haue they in obtaininge their lordes and Princes fauour, what busines in keping the same? They must flatter please al the~, whiche maye hurte or doe good.
And after the appetites of theyr master, their countenau~ces must be counterfeyted, iniuries of their betters must not be spoken of.
Finally what kinde of vices and sery aboundyth not in the Court.
Farthermore what pain labour taketh the marchant, what paine and ieoberdy suffereth he both by land and water, to aduoide pouertie.
Whether soeuer you loke you shal perceaue a greate companie of incommodites.
The life of man is al full of wretchednes, Indifferentlie comen, bothe to good and euill, shalbe meritorious to them whi+che walke the way of christ.
They that folowe the worlde, first howe manie yeres labor they, and swete they, for transitorie thinges, of no valew, then what doutful thin+ges haue they, furthermore how vnsure ende haue they of their laboures.
The more they laboure, the more greuously are they troubled.
And to conclude the ende of their laboure is eternal deth.
Go nowe and compare thys worldly lyfe wyth the waye of vertue, whiche after man hathe enteryd, wereth delectable and pleasaunt, and the ende of this waye is eternall life.
What extreme madnesse is it then to desyre to gette by equall laboure, rather eternal deth than immortall lyfe.
And in case that the way of vertu were more laborous, then the waye of the worlde, yet the sharpenes of the laboure is eased by the hope of the rewarde, and the inspiration and comfort of god is euer ready, whi che causethe that all bitternes is turned into sweetenesse.
In the worlde, businesse commithe of businesse, and sorowe commith of sorowe.
Outward labour and vexation, inwarde grudge and disquietnes of concience.
And where the concience is vnquyet, ther lackith no misery.
The bondage yocke of sinne, is vntollerable and painfull in the ende.
Take vpon you my yoke, and you shall finde reste to youre sowles.
But nowe shall not that lord and capitaine, with all myght and diligence be forsakyn and despysed, whiche is not onely deformid and fowle, but moste false and deceytfull? whiche desireth so vniust labours, promysith so vayn and vnprofitable rewards, and yet decey ith for most part these myserable wretches of them? Or if he performe them, he pull them awaye agayn at his pleasure? and so vexythe hys seruauntes with more payne in lesyng of them, then they had in the gettynge.
None wyth suer and stedfast mynde purposith to vertue, but he obtaynethe.
Farthermore when youe forsake the worlde and folowe Chryste, remember dylygentelie that youe lose not the commodities and plea sures of this worlde (if theie bee plesures.)
But permute change thinges of smale valew, for moch better.
What man in this worlde wolde not gladlie change a lytell siluer for muche golde, shales and huskes for precyous stones.
Peraduentur sum wil say your ryches by this meanes, shall be dimynyshed, but those riches againe shall increase, whyche neyther mothes canne waste ne theeues take awaie.
You shal cease to be in repu tacion and regarde of this world, but Christe shal rewarde you and haue you in reputacion, you please the fewer but the better, your bodye waxeth leane, but the sowle fat, the beuti of your skin decaieth but the bewty of your soule increa seth.
And brefely, there shalbe no co~moditie of this world forsakin, whyche shall not be recompensyd with much better.
And as for such thinges whiche can not be desired without sin, yet possessid had without sinne, as laude and praise of the people, fauoure, loue, honor and suche other co~monly vnloked for, happen to suche as seeke the kyngdome of heauen.
Prayse for the moste parte folowethe them which regardeth her not, and flyeth from them which seketh her.
Suerlye what so euer happen to them whiche loueth it, can not be but plesant.
To whom loue is tur ned to profyt, punishment to comforte, infamy and rebuke to glory, payne into pleasure, bytter into swete, euill into good.
The fowrth Rule is that in all oure acts and order of oure liuynge, we prefyxe Christ as the onely marcke wherat we shote.
BUt that youe maye kepe a more dyrecte waie and suere course to the path of eternal felici tie, the fourthe rule shalbe that in al the actes and order of your lyuinge you prfixe Christe, as the onlie marck and ende, to the whiche you may apply all your actes study labor and diligence.
Inforsinge and faithfully beleuing that Christ is no idle ne vaine worde or voice, but planely singnifieth, and is charitie, mekenes, pacie~ce, clennesse, and all thinges that he taughte.
The deuyll contrarye sygnifyethe and is all, that calleth and moueth from Christ.
And he that seruythe sinne· makith him self bonde to the deuill.
Let the inwarde affection whiche is called the eye or intent be clene, al the bodi which is the work, shalbe clene bewtiful.
In tend christ, and loke alwai to him, as to the onely and speciall god.
So that you loue nothing, desyre nothinge but for vertues sake.
Ab horre nothing, fle nothing, but on ly syn, and for sinne.
Thus doinge what so euer you do, whether you slepe, wake, eat, drynke, praye, or laboure shalbe profitable to you turne you to merite and rewarde.
But if your affection be darke, vn pure, vnclene, and other way inteding then to Christe, what so euer you doe shalbe vnprofytable and pestilent.
For it is offence to doe a good thinge not well.
Brefely all thinges as they hinder or further the iorney of vertue, must be foloed forsaken.
Some be so vicious, that they cannot be ver teous.
As to wil euil to any man, to reuenge iniurye and such other.
And these be alway to be dispised, what profytte or losse so euer they pretend to haue, for nothinge can hurte a good man but onely sin.
Some thinges again be so good, that they can in no wyse be euyll, as to will well to euery creature, to preferre and help your frendes in all honesty, to hate vice, and to haue pleasure in vertuous co~munication.
Some be meane and of the~ selfes neither good ne euil, as learning, frendship, health, bewetye, strength, riches suche other, whiche as they most further our to Christe, so be they most iourneyto be desyred and as they hynder oure iorneye, so be they moste to be dispised.
Learning helpyth more to vertue then rychesse, bewtye, or strengthe of the body: and though all lernynge maye be referred to Christ, yet one more nere then an other· Fro~ this ende that is christ measure the profite and disprofite of all suche thinges as be meane, you wishe and desyre learnyng of gentls, that by the helpe and con ducte thereof, you maye attayne the knowledge of god, priuely hid in holy scripture, and after duelye loue him, and so communicat him to other, and st your mynde and purpose, onely vpon hym.
Spare not, loue and folowe such lerning, but as you shall thinke necessarye for the contynunce of youre good purpose.
If youe fele your selfe substantially stronge, and hope by this lerninge to haue greate lucre in god, be bolde then to wade further in all suche learninge, and turne the riches of Egipt to the making freshe and gaie the temple of god, that is to the de claration of holy scripture.
But if youe perceaue feblenes in youre selfe, and feare you shal haue more hinderance by them then profitte, returne to youre fyrste rule know your self and mesure your self wise ly, with your owne mesure.
That is to say, consider diligentlie your power and strength, and ieoperde not farther then you may wel sustain.
it is better to haue litle knowleged the learnyng of man and feruentelie to loue, then greate knoweledge and loue coldelye.
Then learninge amonge thinges that be meane, is of moste excelen cie. Nexte frendship of the body, strength, bewtie, dignity, birthe, kinred, riches and such other.
As they moste helpe to vertue, so they must be regarded folowed.
We maie not for these meane thyngs, leue our principal course, whiche is Christ, ne to busilie desire them, but be content as god wil and sendeth them.
Fortune sendeth abundaunce of riches, if they hinder not your good purpose, dyspose them, and make frendes with the foode of iniquity.
But if you feare hinde raunce of your good purpose, by reason of this riches, despise then this hurtfull lucre.
Throw this greuous burden into the sea: that is to say, leue it to the world, rather then it shoulde let or hynder your iorney from christ.
Remember alway that aboundaunce of ry hes is a plentifull matter ministred of god to exercise vertu, but ve ry perilous ful of ieoperdy.
For they that exteme mony and possessions of this world as a pre cious thing of much valew, setting in it their most assurance and trust as the chefe anker and suertie of their liuinge, iudging them blessed and happye, whyche haue plentie and aboundau~ce of riches, contrarie miserable and vnhappie when they be taken from them, be false idolators and worship many gods.
For if monie can make man happie or vnhappie, thou ualest thy mony to god, as haue said of money, so may say of honour, bewty, health of the bodye, such other.
We must so seruently intend our onely marcke Christ, that we greatly regarde no suche thinges, whether they be geuen vs or taken from vs, for as the apostell saint Paule saith, the tyme in this worlde is but short, and therfore we must vse it, as they that vse it not.
knowe well the people of this worlde exteme this sayinge as very folishe and vnreasonable, but by suche folishnes, Christ hath saued suche as beleue in god.
And that folyshnes of god is muche more wyse then that wysedome whiche semethe more wise to men of this worlde.
Therefore what soeuer you shal occupy or do proue it by this rule: you vse occupacion or handicraft and you doo well, if you vse it without dysseyt or subtyltie.
But whether referre you the ende of your crafte, to nory she your housholde and wyn them to Christe? Now you do well.
You faste, suerly you do a good worke in ade: but wherfore faste you, to spare your mony, to be countyd more holye? Nowe your intent is nought, you eate and drynke to be strong in your body, to the intent, you maye bee more able to serue god, and vse a more godly worke.
But if you desyre strengthe to preserue your body or to be more able to ful fyll the pleasures of this worlde: Nowe haue you fallen from that marck, which euery good christian man muste haue fyxed in his re membraunee.
Manye desyer god that they maye lyue longe in this world, but let them rather desyre of god a good and vertuous mind, and that hatred of vice and loue of vertue maye dailye increase, that when so euer death shall com, they be not vnprouided, as for time to liue or dye put that to Christ.
And saye with Paul, whether we liue or dye, we liue and dye to Christ.
fonde man whych haste no deuocion of the changing of thy life, and prayest thou mayest not dye, what desyrest thou of god? Trew lye to haue leysure continually to offende god.
Thou desirest riches and canst not vse them, doeste thou not desire thyn owne dystruction? Thou desirest health, and misusest thy healthe, is not this deuocion very vngracious? The deuocion shalbe perfyt if we desire to dye be with Christ, and if we put oure glory and ioye in sicknesse, losse of goodes and other incommodities of this world, glad that we maye be by suche vexacion and truble, conformate and made like to oure hed and capitain Christ.
The fyfte Rule to know perfyt and trewe deuocion from vaine and fayned.
ANd somewhat to ayde and fortesye that we haue sayde, this shalbe the rule: that you exteme and thinke perfit and true deuocion, to assend by iust laboure from those thinges which be visible, meane, and vnperfyte to the knowledg of those, which be inuisible prfyte.
This rule is so necessary, that for dyspysing of it, lack of knowledg of the same, ma ny y^ bearyth the name of Chryst, or perfyt duocion and trew religion, be verye superstycyous and much differth not from the vsage the gntylles.
Let vs therfore immagin co~s tu two wordes the o· intellectable, the other visyble or sensyble.
The intellectabe may be callyd also the angelical in the wich god is contayned and his blessd saintes, the vysible is the huenlye spyres, and all that is contained within the~.
And for our purpose let vs also immagin man as a third worlde pertaker of both the other worldes.
Of the visible, by the body, and of the intellectuall by the soule.
And for as muche as we be pylgrymes in this visyble worlde, we maye not esse but such as we shall perceaue by our wittes or censes eteriour, diligently refer and applye to the intellectuall worlde, by conueniente and mete collacion, or ls to the parte of man, whiche is lyke and respondent to the said world.
The sonne in this sensible worlde resembleth in the anglical world the godly minde and duine sprit, and in man the sowle or the spryt.
The mon in this senble world, representyth in the angelycall the company of agels and holy saintes, and in man the sensual partes or the sensis.
What soeuer this inferioure worlde dothe vppon the earth, that same dothe god in thy sowle.
When you perceue that the bodely eyes be delyghted and com forted, what time the sonne clerly shyneth and resplendantly shedith her beames vpon the earth, think by and by what plesure haue they in heauen, to whome the eternall sonne is euer shinynge, euer rising and neuer goith downe.
What ioy and felicitie hath that pure soule, whom the godly light doth thus illumine.
And thus admonyshed by this visible creature, pray god with Paule, that he that caused lyghte to shine out of darkenes, so illumine your soule, that you may haue the clere knowledge of god, in the face of Ihesu Christ.
If you thinke the nighte darke and painfull, remember the sowles destytute of the godly light, and obfuscate with darkenesse of vice.
And if you perceaue anye condicion of night in your soule, pray god that the sonne of iustyce maye springe in your harte: and plainly coniec ture, that these visible thinges be but shadowes and slender images of thinges inuisible.
The corporal eye delyghtethe in good shape and bewtye of the bodye.
Remember how goodly a thinge is the beutie of thy soule.
Deformitie is odious and displesaunte to the eye, consyder howe odious is thy sowle defyled with sinne.
For the sowle hath a certain proper peculier bewtie and deformitie by the which it pleasythe or displeasyth god or the deuyll.
And hathe also a certayn youth, age, sicknes, healthe, deathe, life, pouertye, ryches, pleasure, sorowe, peace, battell, colde, heate, thyrste, drynke, hunger, meate, and brefelye all thinges that be perceaued by the senses in the body, may well be vn derstande and immagyned, in the sowle.
Therefore in these thinges specially consisteth the to the spyritual perfitelife, that we soberly and easely wihtdrawe oure mindes from these fraile and sensible thinges, and vtterlye set them vpon suche thinges as be eternall, incommutable, puer, and not deceuable.
And this Socrates (not onely in language, but al so in his lyuinge a verye philosopher) wel considd, when he said that then the soul happely departth from the body, if it dewly before hathe remembryd death, and by dispysing of corporall thinges, loue of thinges that be spirituall, and perfyte immagynation of the same, hath acustomed in maner to be absent from the body.
And suer+lye this is the ver crosse, to the which Christ callyth vs when he saithe, he that takythe not vppon him his crosse in this worlde and folowe me, shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen.
And this is the selfe same death by the whych sayncte Paule willeth vs to dye withe oure capitaine Christ.
And when he sayde regarde not these earthlye thinges, ne seke you for the~, but seke you for thinges that be aboue, and be you wise in them.
He mente only that to these corpo+rall thinges, we should be in maner insensyble astonyed, that the lesse pleasure we had outwardlye in corporal and worldly matters, the more pleasure inwardlye we should haue in spirituall and heauenly matters.
And the more kno ledge we had of thinges which be eternall, the lesse we should be mo ued with such thinges as be vayn and transitory.
Then let this rule be euer at hand that you continue not in loue of thinges, whiche be but frayle and caduke, but dilige~t ly ascend to the loue of the~ whiche be eternall, and in comparyson of themdispise these thinges visible.
The bodely disease shalbe more ea sye and tollerable, if you consider it is a medecine for the soule.
And you shal lesse regard the health of your body.
If you set al your mind and diligence in sauegarde of the sowle.
You abhore and dedly hate, venyme that you see, because that you know well, that it destroyeth the body: much more then is that poison to be hated, which infectith the sowle.
Ciente is a venome and poyson perelous to the bodye: but pleasure and fond pastime is more pestilent poison to the soule.
The naturall thonder, and lyghtning of the Elementes, fearithe and abashith the hart of man, but much more that terrible thonder of the mouth of christ our sauiour ought to be fearyd.
Go you cursed people in to the eternall fier of hell.
And such like comparisons man ought diligently to remember in all thin ges sensyble whiche after the dyuersite of ther kind, diuersly moue the mind and hart of man.
Some wyth hope, some wyth feare, some with loue, some with hatred, some with heuines, some contrari with gladnesse.
And this man must also obserue in all his actes, operaci ons which consisteth of the intent inwarde mynd, as of the spirite sowle: of the outward doinge, as of the body or fleshe.
So that he pryncipally regard the mynde and intencyon, for the outwarde acte be it neuer so bewetyfull in syght, lytle or nothing auaileth if the intent be not puer and cleane.
And that witnesseth our sauyour in the gospell of Iohn, saying the fleshe nothing profiteth, the spirit only quicknith and edyfieth.
And therfore man ought not to reioyse or put hys affiaunce and truste in thinges sensyble or cerymoniall, whych Paule callyth the fleshe out warde huske or shale, specially when perfyt deuocion and trewe christianity dothe not consyste in them· ne they be sufficient for the saluation of man.
do not con dempne these corporall ceremonies and outwarde operacyons· which be a meane and helpe to deuocion.
But aduertise and monysh you, that in them consistyth not the verye perfection of a trew chrystian man, nor the vsage of the~ makyth a man truly religious deuoute.
And therfore thapostel Paule reuokyng the Colocenses from the confidens of these ceremonies and outward actes.
And prescrybing vnto them the true rules and preceptes of the spirituall life, saithe.
For as muche as you haue rysen wyth Chryste, seke those thinges whych be inuisible and heauenly, and desire vnderstanding of them, not of earthly thinges, that is to saye visible and temporall, which aperith beutiful in mannes sight.
Mortefy and subdewe the carnal and earthly affections, whiche be as aperyth in Paule to the Galathians, fornicacion, vnclennes, riote, aueryce, enuy, anger, grudge, debate, contencion, deuision, pride, slouthe, ipocrisye, man slaughter, drunckennes, ingurgitacion, dissimulacion, flatery, and such other.
And aboue al thinges be charitable one to the other.
And as our sa uiour Ihesu christ was not borne for him self, lyued not to hym self, dyed not for hym selfe, but in all acts and thinges applyed hym to our helthes and co~modities.
So eche deligently intend and mynde the profyt of other, nothynge regarding his owne priuate profit.
The syxte Rule that we oughte onely to followe the doctryne of Christ, and not to cleue to the more number.
ANd for as muche as in this my hasty writyng vnto you one thynge bryngeth an other to remembraunce.
shal annexe the vi. Rule much agreable with the other aboue saide: as muche neces sary to the health and saluacion of euery man, as lyttell regarded of fewe, that is, that the mynd truely and dilygently desirynge to be conformate vnto Christe, disceuer it selfe bothe from the deedes and opinions of the comminaltie, and most parte of the people.
And onely take and lerne of Christ the very exaumple of trewe and perfyte deuocion: For he is onely the true lighte and exaumple, from whom who so euer (be it neuer so lyttell) departeth, he mysseth the ryghte pathe, and erreth from the hyghe waye.
And therfore the principal care chiefe labour of euery christen man shoulde be, diligently to take hede that the infantes chil dren fro~ their cradles and tender age, as wel with their nurces as their parentes and masters, lerne suche opinious and condicions as be mete and agreable with the actes and preceptes of Chryst, specially when those thynges moste depely remayneth in reme~brance, and nerest sinketh in the stomake, which be taken lerned in youth.
Suffer not good christen men the te~der eares of your infantes to be infected with folishe and fond songes of loue, whiche commonly be songe bothe at home and without forthe, more impure and vncleane then the heathen and vnchrysten men well can suffer and abyde.
Let theim not here the myserable lamentacions and bewaylynges of their parentes, for losse of goddes temporall: neyther the vayne commendacions of them whyche vnlawfully increaseth and gathereth the goodes and possession of this worlde.
For the nature and appetite of manne is very frayle, prone, and ready to vyce, redelye and quickely takynge occasion to cuyll.
As the drie towe quyckely taketh fier if it be adioyned.
The~ suche common errours and fonde opinions, as commonly be vsed among the people, be vtterly to be pulled out of the stomacke and remembraunce of men.
And in their places holsome opinions and true doctrine must be ingraffed and soo rooted in the harte, that noo contrary exaumple or teachyng may pulle them awaye.
And so doinge man wilfully without laboure or businesse, shall followe vertue: and iudge them that doth contrary, worthy rather to be pitied and holpen, then followed.
And that ment Socrates, when he sayde, that vertue is the parfyte true knowledge of thynges to be desyred, and thynges to be auoided exschud.
And the same Socrates disputing with Pithagoras by euident argumentes proueth, that trewe and perfyte knowledge is of so great a power and effecacy in all kinde of vertue, that sinne and offence onely procedeth of false opinions, and lacke of knowledge.
For both they that loueth almigh ty god, and they that loueth pleasures, money and the false disceyuable honour of this worlde, followe and ensue that thing which semyth vnto them pleasante good and bewtifull.
But these whyche thus fondly set their minde vpon pleasures, money, and honoures of this world, be deceiued for lack of trew knowledg, folowing that thing which is most displesaunt, for that whiche is moste pleasant, reputyng and iudgyng that moste profitable which is most hurtfull and that to be hinderance, wherin is moste lucre and aduauntage, thynkyng also that thinge moste lawfull, whiche is most vyle and filthy, and that thing most shamefull whiche is moste honorable.
But he that perfytly knowith in whose stomake and mind this per swasion is substauncially rotyd, that onely vertue is the thynge most good, moste plesaunt, moste bewtiful, most commendable, and moste profytable.
And contrarye that vyce only is the thing which is most euill dysplesaunt shamful and hurtful, and iudgeth not vertue and vyce after the common opinion of men but of their priuate and peculier natures, cannot be so longe as this perswasyon remaynethe in hys remembraunce, that he longe continewe in synne.
The common hauiour and faion of me~ is the worste example authour, bothe of liuyng and also of knowledge.
For from the falle of Adam vnto this time, continually those thinges in thys worlde, whiche hath byn worste hath pleased the most part.
Haue not therfore this fantasy or imaginacion in thy sef.
This is the common facyon and maner of men, this is commonlye vsid in all men, these be the stepps of mine auncetors, this is the opi+nion of suche a great doctour and deuine, after this maner comonly al noble men liue, thus the great bishoppes and prelates of the holye church dothe, these be not the common sorte, why shoulde not do as they do? Let not good christian man these greate tytells and gloryous names deceyue thee.
measure not at this time the commons of their lowe estate condition or birthe, but of their minde affection towarde god, for call all them indifferently commons, whiche be drowned in carnall affections, lyue after the appetites desyers of the fleshse, regarding and folowinge the deceiuable ima ges and shadowes of thinges, for the verie trew things.
That mason greatlye dothe misorder hym selfe which formyth not the stone after the rule but fashionethe the rule after the stone.
Howe muche more then misusyth they them selues which apply not their liuings and maners after the rules and commaundementes of Christ, but inuert and turne the commaundementes of Christe after theyr lyuinge and appetyte.
Thinke not that thing good vertuous whiche the greate capitaines and rulers of the churche doethe, or that the moste parte of men doeth.
But exteme, that only good and vertuous, which is agreable to the teachinge and rules of Christe.
And haue that thinge greately suspectid whych commonly pleasith the most parte.
The flocke or companie of trew Christians is very litle or smal in comparison, but hap py and blessid, to whom onelie the kingedom of heauen is promisyd.
The wai of vertu is very straight and narrowe, and vsid and occupi ed of verie fewe, and yet none can enter to eternall lyfe but by that waie onelie.
prudent and wyse builder, seketh not in his building example of the moste vsid and com mon worke, but of the beste.
And one expert and crafty paynter folo weth in his paintinge, the moste crafty and best tables.
Christe is onelie our exaumple, in whom alway of good and vertuous liuing doth consist, and him without excepcion man maye in all his workes folowe.
But of men (reputed vertuous and good) exaumple is to be taken, as farre as their actes be confyrmable to our headde and chife exaumple Christe.
The common sorte and greatest parte of theym whiche haue professed Christ and are called christe~, liue so fylthely and corruptly, as towching their maners and outward behauiours, that among the infydelles was neuer more corrupte and abhominable liuinge.
Notwithstanding this is vndouted, that trew and vnfained faith is prouid, by outwarde operations.
Rede ouer the old cronicles, and auncient histories of our forefathers, and you shall fynde that sober discretion, honest conuersacion, and good maners were neuer so muche despised and lesse regarded.
When was ryotous wan tonnesse more liberally vsed? whe~ were fylthy fornication, and dam nable aduoutry eyther so greatly occupied, or lesse punisshed and in rebuke? The greate pryncis and rulers of the people, so auoure in other men their owne vyces and fautes, that now a dayes nothing is honestie or good hauyoure, but such as commonly is vsed among the courtiares, when nothinge is more abhominable.
And that cau seth the misbehauyour of princes and greate men, of whome other men commonly take example.
If a man nowe shoulde liue contrary to the common hauiour and vsage of men, he shoulde anone be deludid and scorned, reputed as an ide otte, dotard, and ipocrite.
Thus we christen haue in remembrance the doctrine of Christe, and so expresse it in our liuing, that nothig is nowe counted among vs more vile, more folishe, more shameful then to liue truly after the lawes of Chryste, as who saith, Christe vaynely and withoute cause was conuersante here in earth, orelles that trewe christianitie is not the same it was wonte to be, or that it indifferently parteyneth not to all men.
From this fonde and folyshe opynion of men, councell euery good christen man, that he vtterlye withdrawe his mynde, and that he measure all thynges onelye as they be agreable wyth Christ.
Who commonly now doth not hyghely txteeme and repute it great felicitie in this world, to be borne of noble parentes and aunci ente stocke, whiche men call nobilitie.
Of the which many so glory and reioyce, that in comparison of them, they thincke other no men.
But a good christen man shall repute that onely to be hyghest and trew Nobylitie, to be renewed in Christ, to be graffed or planted in his bodye, to be one body and spyrite with God.
Lette other haue pleasures to be conuersaunt in the courtes and houses of greate prin cys.
But thou christen man chose with Dauyd to be counted an abiecte in this worlde, so thou be of the house of God.
Beholde and see what men Chryste hath chosen to be his discyples, poore men, and no menne of reputacion as to this worlde.
In Adam we were all men of equall birth, and in Christ we be all one and equall.
Trewe Nobilitie is to despise this vayne Nobilitie, and to be the seruauntes of God.
Heare what Christe sayth in the gospell of Iohn vnto the Iewes, which semith gloried that they discendyd fro~ the stocke of Abraham.
You are saith he the children of the deuill, and execute fulfil the worke of your father, as who saith, loke whose steppes you folow, and their children you are to be cou~ted.
Saint Paule al so in his epistle to the Romaines, exteminge nobilitie, after the rule of his maister Christe, saithe.
All that be circumcised be not trewe Israelites, neither all those that discended of Abraham, be not the children and sonnes of Abraham.
It is a shamefull nobililitie to be seruaunt to vyce, and disceuer fro~ Christe.
The hyghest nobilitie is to be the sonne of God, and coheire with Chryste.
The common people iudge and repute him very hap py, wise fortunate, which hath gathered great richesse and posses sions: But iudge thou him onely blessed who hath possessid Christ, and purchased the precious iewel of pure and cleane concience, and founde the highe treasure of eternal wisedom, more precious then al the riches in this world.
What shall call then richesse, iewels, and possessions, which men of this worlde haue so greatly in admira ion and honour· trewely they be as thornes and brambles, which hynder the worde of God, of his and growyng in the soule of man.
And as it apereth in the gospell of Mathewe, a gruouse burden, with the whiche men laden, can not wel passe the straight waye of vertue, ne enter the lowe and narowe gate of the kingdome of heauen.
Reioyce not therfore· in thy riches, ne for thy abundance, repute thy selfe better then other; but more in bondage, more burdened and loden.
He hath plenty and aboundantly ynoughe, whiche is contente with a little.
He is sufficiently prouidid for, to whom our sauioure Ihesu Christe hath promised that nothing shal lacke.
He can not hunger whiche hath pleasure in the swete refreshing of the worde of Ihesu Chryste.
He can not lacke clothing, whom Christ with hym selfe clotheth.
Exteme that only losse and domage when trewe religion and vertue decayeth, and vyce in the sowle increaseth.
Iudge that also onely lucre and aduantage when thy soule is made better by encrease of vertue.
Thou canste lacke nothing when thou hast possession of him, in who~ all thinges be conteined.
Further more what thinge is that whiche these miserable blinde people call pleasure, suerly extreme madnes, plesaunte venome and flatteringe mischiefe.
The very perfyte and trewe pleasure is the reioysynge and ioye of a quiet and puer concience, the deintiest meates be study and intelligence of holy scripture.
The most plesaunt songes be psal mes of the holy ghoste.
The most mery company, be the feloshyppe of all sainctes.
Purge then thyne eies, thy eares thy pallet or thi tasting, and christ shall waxe plesaunt.
Which when thou hast perfectly tasted, al these worldely pleasures if they were put in one, shall seme but carion.
That thynge is not vtterly to be iudgid swete and pleasant, which commonly sauouryd in the mouth of euery man.
But that which sauoureth to a hole man and a man of good iudgement: if water to a man disseased with an axes did sauer all wyne, no man wold iudge that pleasure.
Thou art deceyued if thou beleeue that vexacion and trouble of this world is not more pleasaunte and swete vnto a good and vertuous ma~, than these fond pastimes, disportes and laughinges, vnto a vicious manne: vnto whom also fasting and abstinence is as muche acceptable as to the other daintie disshes, and delicate bankets.
Conclude therfore, that very trewe and perfecte pleasure, is onely to delyghte in the loue of god, and not to regard the vayne pastimes, and fained pleasures of this worlde.
And sume what to speake of Loue and Hatred, how greatly doth the common sorte of this worlde abuse these two voca bles and names· when a younge man fondely disposyd, mouethe a younge woman to fleshelye luste, and vnclennes of the body, the co~mon sort calleth it loue, whe~ there can be no greater hatred, then to dispoyle a younge woman, by giftes or faire speche of that, whiche is her cheife iewell and treasure, that is to say, her virginitie, sham fastnes, clennes, good mynde and fame.
When the father and mother to muche dotynge vpon their children, correct not sharply their outragious wantonnesse, and abhominable vyces, but by their suf feraunce mainteyne and supporte them therein.
The common people extemith it highe loue, and often times saith.
Consider how ten derlye they loue their chyldren, when they shoulde rather saye, se howe cruelly they hurte their chil dren, whiche whyle they followe their wanton apetites, and suffer the~ vnpunished, regarde not their healthe, ne their saluation.
For what thing can be more pleasante vnto our ghostely ennemy the deuil, then that we here frely offend vnpunished, and be punished eternally in hell.
The common people also callith him a gentyll mayster and mercifull prince, which wyll not se the sinnes of his subiectes, and in that guith theym occasion to sinne more freely, because they be vnpunished.
But what doth almightye god threaten by his prophet, vnto such as he reputith vnworthy his mercy.
shall not visite by my correctio~, saith almighty god, the fornicacion of your dau ghters, punysshe your daughters in lawe, when they do aduou trye.
But vnto Dauyd and other his electe and chosen chyldren he saith.
shal correct sharply with a rodde your iniquities, and with greuous beatinges punishe youre offences, and yet will not with drawe from you my mercy.
Here you maye see howe all thinges be renued in Christ, and the maner of thinges chaunged.
He that fondly loueth him selfe, hateth hym selfe deadly, he that is folishe pitiful vpo~ him self is most cruel to christ.
To hate wel, is to dispise: to hurt well, is to do good, and to destroy well, is to preserue.
Then shall you best noryshe your selues, whe~ you moste despise the appetites of the fleshe· when you moste sharpely correcte the offence and sinne of man, then shall you be moste beneficiall to man.
When you haue by correction kylled the synner, then shal you preserue man.
And when you haue dystroyed that, whiche man hath co~mitted, then shall you preserue that which god created.
And furthermore what dothe the common errour of people cal pow er or might and strength of the bo dy? Do they not commonlye call hym a myghty man, and of great power which at his pleasure may hurte when he wyl.
And yet truely this is a very odious and daungerous mighte, to haue power to hurte, or to can or may hurte, whi che is common vnto theym with adders and scorpions, and other venemous and hurtfull beastes.
And with the deuyll also, whose nature and property is only to do hurt and dyspleasure.
Onely god is trewly and verily to be counted mighty and of greate power, whi che neither can hurt if he woulde, ne woulde if he mighte, whose na ture is onely to do good.
But this worldly myghty man, commonly called a man of great power, how can he hurte man, and after what maner? he may violently take fro~ man his mony or possessio~s, beate or wounde his bodye, take awaye his corporal lyfe.
If he do this to a good and vertuous man he doth him a good turne, in the stede of an euyll, and if he doe it to a vicious and euill disposed man, yet at the leaste he hath ministred vnto him an occasion of good, that is to be pacient, and hath only hurted him selfe, for noo man can haue hurte but of him selfe.
And he that intendeth in any wise to hurt a nother, can not but greuously fyrste hurte him self.
As shalbe declared more openly by example, you intende to robbe and dispoyle me of my money, nowe haue you offended charitie, and indamaged your sowle, you can not beate or wounde mye bodye, excepte you firste wounde your sowle: take from me the life of my body excepte you kylle and destroy your sowle.
The common people calleth him a valiant couragious, and a strong manne, which is so cruell, fierse, and yet so very impotent of mynde, that he can nothinge suffer, but for euerye light trifell and displeasure is fumous, angry, geuinge checke for check, and displeasure for displeasure, and contrary hym that paciently sufferith iniury and dyspleasure, and holdith his peace, when he is rebukyd, they call childishe, dastard and of no corage.
And yet nothing can be more different and diuerse from trewe strengthe and highe corage of the mind, then for a light worde or displeasure to be disquyeted, furyous and angrye, and not to haue power paciently to suffer the folyshe lightnes of other, and to thynke hym selfe noo man excepte he be reuengyd, and for one shrewde turne doe two or thre.
But howe much more coragious and stronge is he to be coun ted, which doeth not onely pacient ly suffer iuries and displeasurs, but also doeth good against euill.
call him not strong, ne of audacitie, whiche fiersy inuadyth his enemie, valiantly assauteth or sca lyth the walles of his enemies, dispising his life, putteth him selfe to all perylles: whiche thinge is common to all quarellers and sedicious parsons.
But he that can manfully withstande the beastely appetytes, and subdewe his irful mind, desiring weale to him whiche would him hurte, and do them good, whiche are hys ennemyes, praying for the~ which speake him euill.
Let vs discusse also what thinge this worlde callith ioye, honoure, and worshippe, ignomy and shame.
Thou art com mendyd, but for what thynge and of whome.
If thou be praysed of vicyous for thy myshayour and vicious acts it is false commenda cion, and trew opprobry shame.
Thou art dyspraised, scorned, and rebukyd for thy profyt, deuocion, and trewe christianity and simple nes, and that of vicious and euill disposed personnes, thys is no rebuke, but most highe honour, and commendation, and though al the worlde in this case would skorne and disdaine thee, yet it cannot be but glorious and honorable, whiche christ commendith aloweth.
And contrarye, if all men vniuersally would prayse and alowe the actes and operacions, it can not be but shamfull, that dyspleasyth Christ.
Prudency, wysedome and polecy, is commo~lye called of men of this worlde, stoutlye and diligently to gather goodes and possessions of this world, to stablishe make suer that, that is gotten, and to prouyde for all the posteritie, for after this maner we maye heare the common sort earnestlye speake of suche as in shorte tyme haue increasyd theyr ryches and worldly possessyons, he is a profy table man, wise and ware, a man of great policie, and good prouision.
This the world speaketh and worldly people which befalse and deceitfull, as is their father the de uyll.
Thou folishe and vnwise man that thus hast gathered the goodes of this world, this nyght thy sowle shall be deuydyd from thy body.
certayn man re membryd in the gospell fyllyd vp pon a tyme, all hys barnes, wyth dyuers kinde of corne, and plentifully stuffed all his store howses wyth al manner of vyttailes, and gatheryd and hurdyd vp store of money, thynking nothynge to remayne, but only to vse and occupy his goods so gatherid, and yet the gospel callith hym fole.
For what may be callid more folishe or more dasterdnes than to delight in shadowes of things for the very thin ges, so carefully to prouyde for this fraile, vncertayne, and vnsta ble life, continually decaying, and nothynge prouyde, for the lyfe to come: whiche muste nedes be miserable, excepte it be substancially prouidid for in this worlde.
Here also a nother erroure of the common people, they call him prudent and a man of good knoweledge whiche desyrous of tidinges, kno weth commonlye, what is done, throughout the worlde, what for tune and lucke marchauntes hath had, what the Emperour intendythe to doo, what newelties at Rome, what busines in Fraunce, howe the Daues lyue, and to be bryefe, can clatter of al matters, and speake all languagys.
But what may be more folish or more vndiscretely done, than so much to desire the knowledge of thinges done so farre of, and which partay neth nothinge to thee, and to haue no remembraunce of suche things as be done wythin thy stomacke, and pertayn only to the.
Thou tel lyst what trouble, busynes and dis quietnes is in strange places: but tell rather howe anger, enuie, voluptuous pleasure, and ambicion, vex and distrouble thy soule, rebel linge againste reason, howe nere they be subduyd, what hope of vic tory, how stoutly reason is armid against them.
If thou be in these thinges waking, light earyd, and quick eyed, circumspect, ware.
Be not conformate to this worlde and world lye parsons in euill, but bee reformyd in thy vnderstandynge that thou mayst alow not those things whiche commonlie these worldly men folowe, but approue the good will of god and folowe those thinges whiche be pleasant vnto his goodnes.
EUery good and parfyte Christen manne moste depely hath roted in his remembraunce those briefe and compendiouse rules of trewe christianity.
Firste that he perfectely knowe and beleue that he is not borne vnto him felfe onely, nor oughte to wyll or desyer to liue as to him selfe.
And that he ex teme not other hys beinge in this worlde, or any other good thynge whiche he hath obtayned, to come of hym selfe.
But that he exteme all suche thynges, receiued of allmyghty god onely, moste hartely thanking him, for his suche great goodnes and benefytes receyuyd without his deseruing.
And plain ly repute all suche good and profitable thinges as he hath common to all men.
He muste vnfainedly loue all good and vertuous men in Christe, and all vici ous and euill men for Christ, whiche so vehemently and firste, as an example louyd vs when we were his ennemies, that he disdained not, willingly to geue him self for oure redemption.
And therefore euerye true and good christen man must charitably loue all men indif ferentlye, the good for their good nes and vertue, the other that by his kinde and charitable behauyoure, he maye reduce and brynge them to vertue: as the faithful discrete phisician, hatyth not hys pacient because he is sicke.
So a good christen man muste hate no man, but be enemy only vnto vice.
And the more greuous and ieoper dous the sicknes or disease is, the more deligence labour shal pure and parfect charitie geue, to helpe remedy him that is diseased.
As in example, thy neighbour or brother is an aduouterar, a sacrilege, a turke, thou must hate the aduou trar not the man, dyspise the sacrilege not the man, distroy the turk not the man.
And dilygentlye laboure that by thy cure industry, the vicious man maye perish whi che made him self, but that the ma~ maye be saued, whiche almightye god did create.
He muste also hartelye without colour or collusion, will well to al men, praye for the~ do them good, not hurting them whiche haue deserued hurte, and doing them good which haue not deseruid it, as muche glad and reioysinge, of the commodities and profytes of al men, as of his own, and equally sorrofull and displeasant, for their incommodities and disprofites, as for his owne.
And that mente the apostell S. Paule when he sayde.
Mourne ye and waile ye with them that be sorow full, and be glade and reioysynge, with them that be mery.
Amongst christen men a nother mans losse and hinderance is more heuely to be taken, then his owne, and more to bee reioysed of a nother mans prosperitie then of his owne.
And therefore good christen man thou maiest not haue these cogitacions and thoughtes in thy selfe, what haue· to do with yonder man, knowe not whether he be good or euil, he is a strau~ger vnknowen to mee, and a man that neuer dyd me benefyt or pleasure, he hathe done mee hurte and dysprofyt in tyme paste, but neuer profyt.
But only thou must remember haue in thought, by what merite or desarte our sauiour Christ, solouing lye and benefycially hathe dealte with thee, which desyreth not hys benifycence, and goodnes so plentyfullye mynystred to man, to bee requyted and renderyd towarde hys hyghnes, but in oure neygheboure.
And onlye consyder, what thyng thy neyghbour nedyth, and what thou maiste doo.
Remembre this onely good christin man in al things concerning thy neighbour he is thy brother, and creatoure of almighty god, coheredytour with Christ, a member of the body that thou arte, redemyd with the same bloud, fellow and partaker of the same faith, called and ordeined to the same grace and felicitie of the eternall life to come.
Ye be one bodie and one spirite, called in one hope of the same vocatio~, hauing one god, one faithe, and one baptime.
How can he than be a straunger vnto the whiche in so many things is one with the.
Amonge gentiles these rethoricall circumstaunces, whiche folowe dyd greatly helpe, eyther to frendshyp, or enmytie, loue or ha tred, he is of the same citie or cite zen with me, mine alie or kinsema~ of my familiar aquaintance, my fa thers frende, he hath ben kynde benefycyal to me, he is borne of a worshypfull stocke and in honest place or countre, in Christ al these thinges be nothinge, or else after the minde of Sainte Paule, they be all one, the same thinge.
And to a christen man, onely this reme~ braunce shalbe sufficient, he is my fleshe and brother in Christ.
That thinge that is charitably done to the member, dothe it not redownd vnto the hole body, and to the hed also? We be all members of one bo die eche in his proper and peculier place, and the hed of oure bodie is Ihesus Christ.
Then all thinges good or euyll, done to the leaste of the members be done to euery Crystian man, to Christ and to god also, for all these be but one.
And therfore these olde prouerbes and common sayinges among men of thys world, be not to beregarded among cristen men, like commonly reioyce in like.
To what intente shoulde the name of hatred be spoken of among christen men, when betwne them is so greate vnitie, and they so many wayes agre in one.
It sauoryth no trewe christianitie that the courtiar commonly, disdeineth the craftes man, the husband ma~, the citizen, the gentill man the yeman, the rich man the poore man, the englishe man the french man, the maried man the bacheler, the gramarian the deuine, the seculer preste, the lay man.
Wher is trew and perfyt charitie, whiche faythfully and hartely louyth the ennemie, when the alteration of theyr name, contrary and such other like causith amonge them so great hatred, discorde, and enuye.
But let thys passe, and let vs accustome oure self in remembraunce of that whiche saynte Paule counsailith.
that is that al christen men in our hed Chryst, be the members of one body quyckened anymatid with one spiryte.
In case we lyue with Christ, and that we enuy not those members, whiche haue not receyued so plentifully gyfts.
And glad ly helpe them whiche be in lower condicion, and of lesse abilite than we.
And that certainely ment S. Paul when he sayde to the Coryn thyans.
As the corporall body beyng one hath many members, and all the members thoughe they be diuers and many be but one body.
So all we in Christ certaynly in one spirite, be baptised into one bo dy what so euer nacion, condicion, or degre we bee of.
And vnto the Romayns in lyke maner he wry tith saying.
As in one bodye naturall, we haue many members, and euery member hathe his seuerall and dystinct acte and operacion.
So all good crysten men be one, the same body in Christe, eche the members of other, hauing distinct seperate giftes according to the gyftes which be geuen them.
And in a nother place he commaundith that eche beare and sustayne the burden of others, because we bee membres of one body.
Consyder therefore good christen man, whether those persons parteyne to the body whiche commonly saye, my rychesse and possessions be discended vnto me as to the right heire, and possesse them laufully, why maye not vse or abuse theym at my pleasure, why shoulde geue any part of them vnto suche as owe nothynge vnto? waste and consume them: that that is consumyd is my nown, what hath other men to do therwith.
Alas good Christen man, thy brother member with the in Christ for hunger and lacke of meate is lyke to perishe, and thou wastfully and gluttonously consumest thy money in ryot, and banquetynge.
Thy brother in Christ is nakyd shakyth for colde, and thou sufferyst thy garme~tes to be eten with mothes.
Thou fondly castyst thy money at dyse, and seyst so manye yonge women for lacke of helpe, and in maner inforcid through nececessitie, fall to vnclennes, and fil thinesse of the bodye, and sufferyst the soule which Christ died for, so miserably to perishe, and yet saiest what haue to doe therwith? That whiche is mine, order at my pleasure.
And hauing this vngracious minde, thinkest thy selfe a good Chrysten man, when thou art not to be countyd aman.
Thou hearist the name of thy neighbour in company, defamyd, and holdyst thy peace or haste delectacyon or pleasure in hearing this infamy, and slaunderous communicacion, and sayest would haue rebukyd them if their communycation per+tayned to me, but for asmuche as it touchyd not me, let them speake therin, which fele them selfe greuyd.
Alas christyn man, if thou be of the body all thynges that towchith anye of the members, towchith the also, and if thou be not of the body thou belongist not to the head which is Chryst, nor art not to be countyd a christen man.
Fur+thermore the common people saye it is laufull to be reuengyd of violence and iniuries, done towards them.
force not what the ciuill or imperiall lawes permit or suffer.
But maruell greatly howe these common sayinges, entryd in to christen mens stomakes or condycyons, dyd hurte him, but was prouokyd by former displea sure, had rather do displeasure then to suffer it, in case mans law doo not punishe that whiche they permytte and suffer.
Thynkeste thou that thy capytayne Christe shal suffer the vnpunyshed, if thou offende and breake hys lawes? whiche is recyted in Mathewe, where he sayth.
wyll and commaunde you that you violently re syst not iniuries and displeasures, ne couet you not to be reuenged of your ennemies, but loue you them vnfaynedly, And be you benefyciall and well doinge toward them whiche hate you: And praye you hartely for them which persecute and slaunder you, that you maye be the very faythefull and trewe children of your father in heauen, which causethe the sonne to shyne bothe vpon the good and the euyl, and causethe the rayne to dyscend as well vpon the iuste as vniuste men.
Christ commaundeth not these thynges vnto vs that be laie men, but to the apo stelles and suche as be religious and perfite.
Alacke chrysten man diddest thou not heare in the commaundemente of Chryste: that he wylled these thynges to be doone and vsed of his people, to the inte~t they shoulde be knowen the chyldren of theyr father in heauen? If thou desyrest not to be the chyld of god, this lawe parteineth nothing to thee.
And yet ensure thee, he can not be good, whiche coueteth not to be parfyte.
And if thou desyre not the rewarde which is pro mysed to these, whiche keepe and obserue the lawe and commaunde ment of god, the lawe nothing par teyneth to thee.
If you loue onely suche as loue you, what rewarde shal you haue? as who saith none.
But the contrary is synful and ab hominable, where a thynge is requyted and recompenced by an other equiualent, and of like value there is noo det ne duetie remaynyng.
Here also what S. Paule sayth in his epystel to the Romaines, expounding the foresaid law.
Saye you well by those whiche parsecute you, and not onely to say well, but couet you not to myssay them, rendrynge to no manne dyspleasure for displeasure: and as muche as shall lye in you, be you in peace and quyetenesse with all men, not violently defending your selfe in withstandyng the iniuries and wronges of other: but rather geue place to their fury and anger and withdrawe your selfe, for it is vertue.
Leaue the reuengynge to me and shal reuenge the saith almighty god, but if thy ennemye hunger, geue him meate, and if he thirst geue him drynke.
And so do inge, thou shalte caste burning coles vpon his head.
That is to say thou shalte cause hym to knoweledge him selfe more culpable and worthy to be rebukyd, and shalte do that is in thee, to reconsyle and wyn him.
Desier not to ouercome thine enemy in euil, but ouercome his malice frowardnes in good.
If by my gentelnes and pacience norish the frowardnes and malice of my ennemie, and in suffering his former iniurie, mynyster occasion to hym to doo farther displeasure or hurt, what ende shalbe of his malicious and frowarde minde? vnto whom make this aunswere.
If you maye without offendynge and breakinge the lawes of God, (which call your hurte and onely diplesure) auoide and withsta~d the maliceof your enemy, thinke it very lawfull, and otherwyse thynke more conuenient and neces sary for a christen man to suffer in iurie then to do it.
And to prouoke his ennemie to amendment, other by benefytes and wel doyng orels by pacie~ce.
And in case you can not win him, it is better yc one perishe then both, and that you content please youre captayne Christe, by your pacience, then by reuenginge displease him be made euil with youre ennemie, then let thys be a lawe and decre amonge Chrysten men, that they contend and labour to ouercome eche other in loue, ge~ tylnes, and benyficence, not in con tencion, hatred, obloquy, contume ly, and iniury.
And the greater or more excellente they are, somuche more submytte and humble them self that they maye in all thinges obserue and kepe charitie.
Thou art decendyd of noble lynage and auncient stocke, maners conuenyent and cumely for a christen man, shall not distayne or impayre thy birthe, but make it more honorable.
If thou bee lerned thou muste the more discretely beare and paciently correcte, the lewdenesse of the vnlerned.
The more thou hast receiued, the more thou arte det tid, and owest thy neighboure.
If thou be riche and hast aboundau~ce of worldly goodes and possessio~s, remember that thou art a distribu tour and disposer of them, and not the Lorde or owner of them.
And soo muche more diligentely take hede howe thou handelyst or orde ryst that thyng which is common to manye with the, and put in thy handes to order and dyspose, thou arte dysceyuyd, if thou beleue that proprietie was only forbydden to the spyritualtye, for that equally pertayne to all chrysten men.
The common lawe punyshethe thee, if thou violently take any thing fro~ a nother, and the same lawe punyshethe not, if thou refreshe not thy neighbor in his necessity, but with holdist from him, that which thou callest thyne, but Christ shall correcte and punyshe the for both.
If thou be an officer let not the office make the more cruel, but consider the burden and dewty, whych dependyth vppon thy offyce, and let that make the more circumspecte and ware in executing thy offyce.
But heare, some man will saye beare no office of the church, am no curat, am no byshop.
Alacke my frend, if thou be not of the chur che thou pertaynest not to Christ.
For the church is nothing else but the congregacion or companye of faithful people.
But now a daies, Christ is so in contempte, amonge these worldly people, that they exteme it very glorious and honora ble to be an aliene and a straunger from Christe.
In somuche that he is moste dyspysed which neryst folowyth Christ.
There is one lord only bothe of bishopes and temporall officers whose vicares they bothe be here in Earthe, and shall make straight acounte vnto hym, of the administracion of their offices.
If thou haue other respect the~ vnto hym other in receiuing thine offyces, or in the admynystracion occupying of the same, thoughe the world repute the not as a Si moniake he shal punish the as a si moniacke.
If thou desyre or couet a co~mon offyce, not for the co~mon weale profit, but for thy priuate lucre aduauntage, and to be reuengid, and do displeasure to such as thou bearyste no good mynde, the administracion of thy office, is thefte before God.
If thou persecute theues, not to the intente such as hathe bene spoyled oulde receaue agayne theyr goodes, but that thou mayst conuerte the robbry vnto thy priuate vse.
praye the what difference is betwne the theues and the, but that they haue robbyd the marchantes, and thou theues.
And to conclude, if thou administer not thy office to this in tente, onely that thou be prompte redy not only to lese thy goodes but also thy lyfe, in maintenaunce and defence of ryght and equitye, Christ shalnot commend ne alowe thy administracion and execution of thy offices.
If thou be a Prince and capitaine of the people, suffer not these poysoned vices of flatterers to infect thy eares.
Thou art a kinge and lorde ouer other, thou arte free and aboue the lawes, all thinges that thou mindist be iuste and honest, it is lawfull to the to do what the pleasith, it forsith not what these prestes and preachers commonly precheth, they pertaine nothinge to the, but to other pryuate and inferiour persons.
But haue thou in remembraunce that whiche is trewe, that Ihesus Chryst is the onely lorde and mas ter of all men, vnto whome (for as muche as thou arte here his vicar and officer) it behouyth the to bee lyke and not to differ, whose doctryne is of no man more iustely to be obseruid then of thee, of whom he shall require more strayght accompte then of other.
Thinke not vtterly that lawful that thou min dest, but minde and intend thou no thinge but that which is lawfull.
Thinke not that verteous and ho nest in the, which is culpaple and synfull in other.
But that whiche is but a smale vice in other maner parsones, thinke in thy selfe, abho minable and greuouse.
Suffer no thing to raigne in the, which thou dailye punishyst in other.
Let not thy riches purchase the honour, co~ mendation, dignity, fauoure, and autorytie, among the people.
But thy excelent vertue, and noble con ditions, in the whiche thou muste excel inco~parable, aboue the commons.
Let the people learne of the to dispyse riot, wantonnes, and auarice, and to folow vertu, reioyce in temperaunce, honesty and measure.
Thou shalt very wel dystroy the appetites and affectio~s of the commons towardes mischefe and euyll doing, if they shall perceaue that thou nothynge regardeste ryches and pleasure, matter occasion of vice and inniquite.
Dyspise no man be he neuerso simple, plain ly reme~bryng that ye be redemed with equall one pryce, the bloud of Ihesu christ.
Let not auctority, fiersenes armore, or thy garde defend the fro~ hatred, but y^ puernes of thy liuinge, vertuous conuersacion, vndefylyd maners, and honest condicions.
Thou maist right well in mainteining thy regality, kepe thy high estate, and be equall with other in charitie. thinke this principalitye, (not to excell other in riches) but to profit many.
Remember thou arte a common person, and therfore al thy cogitation must be, of the common wealthe.
Christen prince may not desier, to exercise his power and authori ty vpon his subiectes, but his charitie.
And among christen me, he that is greatist and highest in auc toritie, must thinke him selfe a minister, not a lorde or maister.
And therfore maruell greatlie howe these ambiciouse names and titles of worldly auctorytie, were firste brought in to popes and bishops, when Christe forbade his dyscisples, that they should suffer them telues to be called lordes or maysters, for there is but one lord and mayster, whiche is the head of all Christen menne Iesus Christe.
preacher, a curate, a Bishoppe, be names of charite, not of power, or worldely auctoritie.
But wherefore shuld wade further in this troublouse sea of common errours There is noo kynde of men in the which a very spirytuall man shal not perceyue many thynges to be bewayled and lamented: And ma ny corrupte opynions among chri sten menne, whiche greatly dyffer from the trewe doctrine and learnynge of Ihesu Christe, which for the moste parte, procedeth of this onely: That we haue immagined and brought in a certayne world into christianytie, or amonge chri sten men.
And that (whiche is red in auncient auctours of diuinitye) men easely learned only to referre to suche as be called relygiouse.
The worlde in the gospell, in the wrytinges of the Apostels, sainct Austine and saincte Iherome, is called vnfaythfull people, or infidelles, the ennemies of the crosse of christ, and blasphemars of god.
And suche, for as mutche as they mistrust Christ, and haue no confidence in his promyses, busely care for the worldely lyuinge, fearing that they shall lacke, and neuer haue sufficiente, and carefully labour and stryue for the increase obteynynge of rychesse and possessyons of this worlde, and followe voluptuousnesse and pleasures of this worlde, blinded with the disceytfulnes of sencyble thinges, co uetyng feined good for true good.
This world hath no acqueintance with Chryst, the very and trewe lyghte, and as saynct Iohn saith, is al set in vyce, and synne, louing it selfe onely, liuyng to it selfe onely, and carynge for it selfe onely.
And from this worlde Christe deuyded his apostels, and all suche as he thought mete and conuenyente for him.
Why do we then min gle and conioyne this worlde soo vtterly condempned in holy scripture, with christianitie? And by a fained vocable or fained name of the worlde, coulour our vycious and lewde liuing.
This pestilent erroure is greatly mainteined, by such flatteryng preachers, whiche as sainct Paule saith, peruert the word of god, and apply holy scrip+ture to the maners and condicio~s of men, when it were moste conue+nient, that the condicion and beha+uioure of men, were correctid and amended, according to the rule of holy scripture.
There can be noo more pestylent kynde of flattery, then to mysuse the interpretacion of scripture, and by wordes of the gospell or of the holy prophetes, to meinteine oure vices, not correcte them.
king or a prince herith in scripture, that all power regalytie cummeth of god, and anone he beginneth to excel and ma gnifie him felf.
But why doth not this scripture cause to be more carefull in minde, then proude and haughty.
Thou remembrest that God hath gyuen thee a realme or empyre to gouerne, but thou remembrest not that thou shalt render vnto him accompte of thy gouernance.
nygarde or couetous man, heryth in scripture that it is not lawefull to haue two cotes or garme~tes, the which the masters of diuinitie doo thus interprete: That the seconde cote or garment is that, whiche is superfluous or not necessarye to nature, and that parteineth to the vice of couetous whereat this nigarde greatly reioyceth and sayth.
haue not yet sufficient, lacke many thinges, and therefore shall gather and increase my rychesse.
This beastly man and colde in charytie, hereth that Charitie begynnethe at our selfe, and that this is the order of Charytie.
That a man preferre his own ryches before other mennes: more regarde his owne lyfe then other mennes: setteth more by his owne fame then by other mens, and saith will geue nothing, lacke my selfe, will not defende his name least hurt my nowne.
will leaue my brother or neighbour in ieoperdy, lest come my selfe in ieoperdie, and brefely, wil liue all to my selfe, least by medling with other mens busines, disprofyte or inco~moditie may chaunce to my self.
We haue also learned nowe a dayes to take that onely into example of our lyuinge of holy saynctes and vertuous men, which they dyd contrary to the doctrine and teaching of Christe.
Aduouterars and homicides, flatter them selfe by the exaumple of Dauid.
Couetous and gredy men of the worlde, obiecte vnto vs riche Abraham, pryncys and greate men, whiche counte it but a tryfle or dysporte to defyle maidens, number vnto vs the con cubines of Salamon.
Gluttons, excuse theym by the drunkennesse of Noe. Incestes, in excuse of their fylthynesse, pretende the acte of Loth.
But why do we withdraw our respect in these men fro~ christ? dare boldely affyrme, that neyther in the prophetes, neyther in the apostels, is any thyng to be fo lowed, whiche they dyd contrary to the doctrine of Chryst.
But yf men haue so great pleasure to followe saynctes in that they offended: let them folowe wholly and not in parte.
Thou haste folowed Dauyd in aduoutrye, folowe him the rather in doinge repentaunce.
Thou hast expressed in thy lyuing the vyce of Mary Magdalene, ex presse also her teares, loue, and hu militie.
Thou hast persecuted the churche of Christe, as Paule dyd.
Thou hast forsworn thy self with Peter, spend thy lyfe againe with Pawle, in defence of Chrystes faythe, suffer wilfully persecution with Peter.
Almightye god oure comforte, suffereth somtime holye men to synne, that we when wee haue offended dispaire not, and as we haue folowed them in doynge offence, so we shulde folowe them in makyge amendes for oure offences.
But we commonlye take in example that thinge whiche is not to be folowed, and oftentimes depraue that they did wel, moche after the maner of spiders, sucking that thinge onely whiche is venomouse and poysoned or els by our poysoned stomakes turnynge holsome and good things into venim and poyson.
Thou greedy and couetous man, vnto whom moneye is a god, howe doest thou folowe the riche Abraham, because he by increase of his cattell (almyghtie God prosperynge his substaunce) was made ryche, and that in the lawe of nature.
Thinkeste thou it leful for the (being a christin man) vnlawefully to gather riches and goodes of this worlde? and other vainely to mispende them, or els more vainely to kepe them? How little he regardyd his goodes and possessions, it plainlie apereth, in that he anonne at the voyce of almighty God, broughte his onely sonne to be sacryfied and kylled.
How little thinkest thou he set by his riches, whiche so little regarded his son? And yet thou nothing desyringe, but lucre and aduauntage, nothing regarding but money and riches, redy for a little lucre to deceiue thy brother, and forsake Christe, thynkest thy selfe in condicion lyke to Abraham.
The symple daughters of Loth, seinge they sawe the vniuersall or hole worlde perceyuing (of so greate a multitude) none remaynynge but theyr father and them self, fearing least the kynde of man shuld vtter lye haue peryshed and decaie: of a vhemente loue and zeale to the countenance of mankynd, secretly laye with their father, and at that time, when this commandemente was freshe, and in remembrance.
And darest thou with the facte or dede of these maydens, co~pare thy monstruous pleasures lecherous actes? Dauid also after so many vertuous examples and noble actes, once commytted aduoutrey: and thinkest thou it laufull to the to continue all thy lyfe in fil thy pleasure and voluptuous nes of the flesshe? Peter (for feare of death) once denied Christ, shalt thou therefore for euery trifle forswere thy selfe? Mathewe once co~maundid by almighty god, forsoke his occupacion and office, the suerty of his liuinge, and folowed Christe.
And yet so many exaumples of holye Saynctes, the commaundementes of the gospel so often rehersed, so many sermo~s, and holsome predications can not reuoke thy gredy appetite, and coue tousnes of the worlde.
Uertuous behauyoure and honesty, hath con tinually decayed, sith we haue coloured our vices with thename of vertue.
And haue ben more quick to defend our abhomination, then diligent to amende it.
And meinteined our froward opinio~s, with fayned and false defence of holye scripture.
And therfore good christen man followe not the common fashions and opinions of men, but folowe Christe, the onely auctour and example of vertuouse liuing: and as for thy outwarde behauyour concerning maners, apply thy selfe to all men, so that thy intent and purpose be stedfaste and suer towardes god and his trueth, to the intente thou mayste wynne all men to Chryst.
Rule howe to labour to obteyne that whiche is nerest to a spirituall lyfe.
BUt if our weakenesse of nature, and infancie of Faythe can not attaine to the very parfect and spiritual life, we must at the least labour and inforce to obteine that whiche is nerest to the sayde parfecte and spirituall lyfe.
The very trewe and compendiouse waye to eternall felycitie, is vtterly to con uerte oure hole mynde and intente to the loue and desyre of heauenly thynges.
That as the body naturally hath adioined and associated vnto it, his shadowe, so the loue of christ, the loue of vertue and heuenly thynges, maye acompanye bring with the~ hatred vice and disdaine of worldly things fraile and vncertaine.
The one of these, necessarylye foloweth the other increaseth or discreaseth with the other.
For the more you profyt in the loue of Chryst, the more shall you hate the world: And the more you desier thinges which be inuisible, the lesse pleasure shall you haue in thinges that be visible, vn stable and vnsure.
And therefore that thynge whiche Quintilian counsayleth to be folowed in learning, we must also folowe in vertuouse liuynge: that is, that wee from the beginninge, inforce and intende to the best.
The which if by weakenes of nature we can not obteyn, the next is, that we ware ly and wisely absteyne from notable and open vices and sinnes, as muche as shal lye in your power.
For as the body moste weake and brought lowe (but ryd and cleane from hurtfull humours) is moste nere the natural helth, so the soule not defiled with gret and notable vices, is more redy to receaue the giftes of god, althoughe it lacke, yet the power and perfyt vertue.
If we be weake and not able to fo+lowe in our liuing, the holy Apostells, Marters, and Uirgins, let vs at the least not committe that, that heathen and vnchristen men, maye be sene to excell and passe vs in vertue.
Of the whiche dyuers, when thei neither knew god who~ they shoulde loue, ne beleuyd that hel was, which they should feare.
Thought and decreyd that vice sinne, was vtterly for it selfe to be lefte and auoidyd, insomuch, that they had leather leese their name, riches, life, then to disceuer from morall vertue.
If sin of him self, be so abhominable of that nature, that infidells for no profyt or disprofyt, would commit it.
Trewly thoughe neither the iustice of god might feare him, ne the godnes of god disswade exhort him, nother the hope of eternal lyfe, ne feare of eternal payne reuoke him, nother the natural fylthynes of sin withdraw him, which onely did withdraw diuers gentylls: at the leste the diuers and many incommodyties, whiche commonly followe a sinner in this worlde, should feare a christen man from commission of sinne, that is to saye infamy, wast and consumption of his goodes possessions, pouerty contempt, and hatred of all good men, trouble dtsquietnes of minde, finally that miserable grudge and vexation of concience, the whiche though many men perceaue not ne fele forthe with, other obscured by dulnesse of age, (or drowned in pleasure of yet they shal fele perceaue it at length, the later, the more dau~gerous more to their pain.
And therfore young men ar diligently to be admonished, that they rather beleeue by informacion of others that this is the nature co~dicion of sin, the~ to lerne proue it by experie~ce in the~ selues.
And that by sinne they defile not their lyfe, before they knowe plainelye, what thing the life is.
If thou regardest not Christe, which boughte the so derelye, abstaine yet from vice for thy nowne sake, and thoughe it be very daungerous to co~tinew long in this meane waye, which is onlye to absteyne from notable and common vices, yet to them which cannot ascende to the highe perfec tion, it is muche more commenda ble, to consist in the polyticall and morall vertue.
In this concisteth not the parfect felicitie, and in this state almightie god is diligentely to be called vpon by praier, that it may please hym to helpe, and further vs in hygher perfection.
IF thou perceiue that the storme of te~ptacion dothe very often and greuously assaute the, dysmaye not therefore thy selfe, ne be displesed with thy self, as though almyghty god nothyng regarded thee, but rather thanke him that he instructethe and teacheth thee, as one to be his eyer, that he punisheth and correcteth thee as his moste dere sonne: that he prouith and assayeth the, as his well beloued frende.
It is a manyfeste and great token that man is reiect fro~ the mercy and fauour of god when he is troubled withe no temptacion.
In thy temptacion remember the holy apostell S. Paul, which rapte to the misteries of the thyrd heauen, was troubled and vexyd with the augell of Satan, reme~ ber the temptacion and trouble of the holy man Iob, Saint Ierom and other Saintes, whiche were greuously troubled with their offences.
Sithe this thinge, which thou sufferyst is common to thee, wyth so manye holye men, whye shouldest thou be dismayed or discoraged.
Laboure deligently, to ouercome thy temptatyons wyth them, and almightie god shall not leaue thee without remedye, but shal increase thy strength make the able to sustayne and ouercome thy temptacion.
The. ix. Rule to geue deli gent hede to the assault of oure enemies.
BUt for as muche as oure enemies be very craftye and subtill, it is conuenyent and necessarie that we geue suer and diligente watche, hauing oure minde alwaye redy and circumspecte, againste the assaute of our ennemies.
For they continual ly compasse and labour to distroye vs.
And therfore we must euer be in a redinesse, that when they shal assaute vs, we maye repell them.
And break the hed, that is the sug gestion of the pestilent serpent the deuill, for that is the moste parfyt and easie waye to ouercom him, to withstand his suggestions first mocions before thei grow or take roote in our sowles.
THe ghostly ennemy shal by this meanes speciallye bee repellyd, if thou with all thy harte, hate him or manfully withsta~d his sug gestions, or co~tinually occupy thy minde in holy praiers vertuous occupations, or aunswere him in his te~ptation with wordes of ho ly scripture as before haue taught you.
And in this thing it shall greatly profyt against all kind of temptacion, to gather certaine sen tenses oute of holy scripture, and haue them in memory.
But suche speciallye as youe shall perceaue youre minde to delighte and haue pleasure in, and by the which it is moste commonly mouyd to deuoci on.
The. xi. rule is what we should do in the time of temptacion, and what after the temp tacion ouercome.
BUt of two thinges specially thou must beware, the one is that thou fainte not in temptation and geue ouer to thy enemye, the other that after thou hast manfully withstand him and had the vic torye, thou to muche reioyce not, and be prowde and insolent.
And therfore to be sure, loke that whe~ thy ennemie intiseth thee to sinne, thou haue not respect only to thyn owne imbesilitie and weakenes, but remember that in Christ, thou maist doo all things, which saide not only to his apostels, but to all his members indifferently, truste in me haue ouercom the world.
And after thou hast ouercom temp tacion, and perceinyst thy mind de lyghted, and comforted reioyse in vertuous operacions.
Beware ligently that thou repute not this victory or good dede to thin owne merytes or power but only to the gentilnes and goodnes of almigh tye god, repressyng thy selfe with the wordes of saynt Paule, what thing hast thou, that thou hast not receiuyd, and if thou hast receiued it, whye reioysist thou as though it were done by thine own power, and therfore agaynst these two euylles these shallbe remedyes, if thou in temptacion mystrust thine owne power and strength cleue onely to Christ, puttyng in his be neuolence and mercye, all hope of victory.
And after the victory and ouerthrow of thyne enimy, in thy spyrituall reioysynge thanke all myghty god of hys benefyt, humbly knowlegyng thy imbesylytie and vnworthynes.
The. xii. rule howe to ouercome our spyrituall enemy with hys owne weapon.
WHen thou fightest with thine enemye, think not thys sufficient to repell or withstande his firste suggestion and mocyon, but manfully conceyue the occasyon of his suggestion and returne it agayne thine enemie with his owne weapen or sworde distroying him, and so doing when thou art mouid and intisid to sinne, thou shalt not onelye not offende but of his mocion, take occasio~ of vertu: as the poe tes properly faine yc Herculus the more perills and teoperdies that Iund displeased, obiectid againste him and incombred him, the more his corage increasd, and the more valiant he waxyd.
So geue thou diligence, that by instigation and mocion of thy enemies thou be not made worse, but increase in vertue and valiantues.
Thou art pro uoked to voluptuousnes and plea sures of the body, consider thy imbesilitie, and withdraw thy mind the more from vnlawful pleasurs and delectations, occupyinge thy selfe in vertuous operations and chaste meditacions.
Thou art mo ued to couetouse: increase thy cha ritie and almes toward thy poore neibour.
Thou art intisid to pride and vaine glorye, humble and sub mit thy self more lowly in all thin ges.
And so euery temptacion shal be vnto the a reuenging of a godly purpose, and increase of vertue trewe deuocion.
And trewly ther is none so good and readye awaye to destroye and repell thy enemie as this.
For so doinge he shalbe aferde to prouoke the again to sin, lest he which reioisith to be auctor of iniquitie, minyster occasion of vertue and goodnes.
Rule howe we ought both to fyghte manfully, and the feld ouercom alwaies ready to resist the nexte onset of our enemy.
IN thy conflict and battel with thine enemies, thou must so fyght, as though this should be the last bat tell, if thou ouercom, and haue the better of thy enemie.
For it maye so bee, that almightye God of his goodnes shall geue this rewarde vnto thy vertue noblenesse, that thine enemy once ouercom and con foundid, shall no more assayle the, whiche we haue redde to haue ben graunted to dyuers Saintes and vertuous men.
Orygyn saith that when we ouercom, the power and strength of our enemies decaieth.
And he that is once decayed and manfullye confoundyd, shall noo more be sufferyd to intyse man to sinne.
And therfore in thy battell bee bolde to hope for parpetuall peace.
And when thou hast ouerthrowne thine enemie, so order vse thi self, as though thou should straight enter againe into battel.
After one temptation loke for an other, and departe not from thine armoure, forsake not thy araye or standing, kepe good and suer watche as longe as thou feyghteste in the Castell of this body, hauinge euer in thy remembraunce the saiinge of the Prophet.
shall stand vpon my word or watch and shal be alwaies in readinesse for mine enemies.
Rule howe we oughte to hate al sinnes seme it neuer so smal.
YEt must thou delygently beware that thou dis pise no vice as lyght, not to bee regardyd, for no enemie hathe more often ouercom, then he that hath byn dispisid and nothinge regardyd.
And in this thing diuers men meruelous lye deceaue them selfe, which fauo ryng in them selfe one or two vyces whiche eche (after his maner) thinkith veniall or lyght, hate the resydewe.
great parte of them which are callid vertuous and ho lye, abhorreth greatly, and hateth theft, rape, homycide, aduoutry, and inceste.
But the same lytle or nothing regarde simple fornicacion, and immoderate vse of sonde pleasures.
Some man puer and clene from other vices, is commo~ ly dronken, and accustometh ryot.
Some to hauty and prowd of mynde, but if we thus fauoure our owne vices and delight in the same, howe shall vice be extincte and banished from man? It is a to ken that suche as haue pleasure in anye one vice, trewlye possesse not the other kynd of vertues, but rather shadows and images of vertue.
But he that perfetlye hatyth one vice, hateth all kind of vice, reputyth no vice as light or smal, least from the leaste, he fall to the greatest.
And euery good christen man must thus be minded affectionatyd in him selfe, that though he can not vtterly at once expell the hole company of vices, that he diligently laboure dayly to withdraw somwhat of his viciousnes and filthy appetite and increase in verteousnes and good behauiour.
The. xv. rule is how we should behaue oure selues, if wee chaunce in this fyght be ouercom of the deuil.
ANd if it fortune youe in temptacyon to be dedly woundyd of your ennemy, be not therfore disco raged nor cast away your armour and yelde you to your enemye, as manye dothe which be weake and feble of stomake, which once ouerthrowen, feare againe to ieopard them self in battell, and still conty newe in bondage and captiuite of their enemyes, hauing no remem. braunce to recouer againe theirly berty.
This ferefullnes pusillanimitie is very perylous, whiche commonly bringyth aman to that whiche is worst of all vices, that is to saye, fynal desperacion, and therfore against suche weake and feble stomakes and courage, thys shalbe the remidy and rule.
That when thou hast fallen into synne, thou dyspayre not, but folowe dylygent and couragious souldiers, whome many times, shame of igmominy and payne of the wound doth not cause fle.
But quyckneth and causyth them fight more feirs ly, so thou after thou hast commit tyd a dedly synne delygently haste to retorne agayne to thy corage strength of mynde and amende the rebuke and shame of thy fawle, with new quicknes and corage of vertue.
Thou shalt soner remedye and helpe one wound then many, a fresh and a new wound, then a olde putryfyed stomake, and encorage thy selfe wyth this co~mon prouerbe, whiche Demosthenes, as is co~monly red, did vse and accustome.
man flying, and he shal fyght agayne, that is to saye that man in whome any corage or stomacke remayneth, shall not for a lytle rebuke of his enemy vtterly bee dysmayed, but rather gether strengthe vnto hym, and be reuengyd of hys enemye.
Remember that Dauid the prophete, Kynge Salomon, Peter, and Paul, the apostels.
Not withstanding they were great lyghtes exaumples of holynes: yet they fell into greuous and greate synnes, whome almighty god paraue~ture suffered to fal for this cause, specially that thou shouldest not dispayre, Lifte vp thy self therfore vpon thy fete and with highe courage and bold stomoke, returne againe into battel againste thy enemies, not only more fierse bolde, but also more ware and diligent.
BUt agaynste the dyuers suggestions and assaultes of our enemie, dyuers remedyes be prouidid and had as they shalbe most necessary and expedient, not withstandynge the generall remidye of most effecacy vertue againste all kinde of aduersitie and tempta+tion, is the perfect and diligent re+membrance of the passion or crosse of Christe, whiche is also a refreshing to them that can not labour, an example to them that wander from the righte waye, and sufficiente armour, to them that fyghte, whiche is specially to be obiectyd agaynste all the suggestyons and mocions of the deceitfull enemye.
And therfore it is necessarye that man be substanciallye exercised in this remembraunce, of the passion and punishments of Ihesu Christ.
Some commonly doth reuerence to the image of the crosse, crosse their bodies ouer euery part with thousand tokens or crosses, or reserue and kepe at home a gobet or a pece of the holy tre, and so at certaine and apointed houres call to remembraunce the passion and pu nishment of Christ, hauinge petye and compassion vpon him as vpon a iuste and rightwise man, wrong fullye punished.
In this consisteth not any trewe fruitie of the crosse of Christ, but rather norisheth supersticion idolatrye.
But rather laboure thou good christen man diligentlye inforce thy selfe to ascend to the high and toppe of this tree, or crosse, and to obtayne the true fruite therof which specially consisteth in subdewing and mortefying the worldly affections.
And therby to desyer to be confyrmate and made lyke to the head capytayne, whiche is Christ.
And this is vtterly to be desyryd of all men, in whom the spirite of god is quycke and lyuinge.
For he that perfectly and faythfully louyth a nother desyryth in all thynges to be like vnto him, whom he louith.
But that you may more fruictfully remember, and to your healthe recorde the mystery of the crosse of Christ, you muste dilygentlye prepare a certaine maner and deuout arte to fyghte with your enemye, and in the same diligently exercise your selfe, that when oportunytie and tyme shall requyer you maye be sufficiently preparyd and in redynes to withstand the inuasions and mocions of youre ennemyes, that is to saye, that to euery singu ler affection and pleasure of thys world to be mortified and oppressed, thou applye that parte or porcion of the crosse, which is moste respondente.
For there is no temp tacion or aduersitie, whiche hathe not his peculier proper remedye in the saide crosse or punishmente of Christe.
As in example, when thou arte inflamyd to ambicion or pryde of this world, and arte asha myd to be in contempte and dispysyd of other, remember thou vyle and lowe member of Christ, how great and excellent in comparison to the, thy head and captayn was, and howe lowly he submitted and humblyd hym selfe for thy sake.
When thou arte prouokid and mo uyd to enuye, remember howe louingly and gentelly thy capitayn Chryste wholy gaue hym selfe to our vse, how good he was to the~ that were worste and moste vicious When thou arte mouid and in tised to gluttonye, remember that he in his thyrste had geuen him to drinke Eizell gaule.
When thou arte temptid of lechery and volup tuous pleasures of the bodye, remember howe pure and cleane all his lyfe was, from fylthynesse of the bodye and other voluptuousenes.
When thou art intysed to the synne of wrathe and anger, reme~ber howe mekely and lyke a la~be, he helde his peace, when he was rebuked, and howe pacientlye he suffered the obloquy of his aduersaries.
If pouertie trouble and dis quiete thee, and the synne of couetouse moue and prouoke the, reme~ ber that the lorde and maker of al thynges, was for thy sake made so pore and nedy, that he hadde no place ne cottage, whiche he chalenged as his owne, wherein he myght dwell or continue.
And if in other te~ptations, ye vse and exercise your selfe after this maner: It shall not much be peyneful vnto you to resist themotions of your ennemies, but also you shall perceiue greate fruite and pleasure: For as muche as by this holsome remembraunce, you shall vnderstande that you be conformate to your head, and shal so recompence him his great paynes and punishmente whiche he suffered for your sake.
Rule howe greate a helpe to resyste synne, is to remember howe detestable a thinge synne is.
And though this be the most redy and present remedye agaynste all kynde of temptation: yet it shal greatly pro fyte to suche as be weake and infyrme, if they diligentely remember when they are moued and inti sed to synne: Howe fylthy, howe pestilente, howe abhomynable a thynge syn is.
And contrary how noble and excelent the dignytie of man is.
In trifles and matters of smalle valewe, we councell and take good aduisemente with oure selfe.
And in so weightie a matter, shal we not diligently remember with oure selfe, before wee bynde vs to the deuyll, by oure consent: as by oure wrytynge and obligations? Howe marueilouselie wee were created, in how excelent condicion and degree, set aboue other creatures.
Howe preciousely we are redemed frome captiuitie and tiranie of sinne: and to how great ioye and felicitie we be called and ordeyned.
Shall we not also remember and recorde in oure myndes that man is that gentyll and honorable beaste, for whose cause almighty god created made this vniuersal world, that ma~ is the citizen of angels, the sonne of god, the heire of immortalitie, a member of Christ.
And that the bodye of a christen man is the temple of the holy ghoste: and the sowle or mind of man, is the similitude and image of almighty god, the secret chamber of the deuinitie.
And contrarye that synne is the miserable destruction, and pestilent infection bothe of the bodye and sowle, the deadly poyson of oure moste cruel ennemie: the bayte of the deuyll, and the erneste and pledge of oure moste miserable and beastely seruitude and bondage: and after you haue thus diligently remembryd with your selfe, then take good ad uiseme~t, whether it be co~uenyente or profytable, for so disceitful poisoned, short delectation of syn, to fal fro~ so gret dignitie noblenes vnto such indygnitie and mysery, from the which thou canste not at thy pleasure delyuer thy selfe.
Rule to auoyde sin, by and by, comparing the. ii. heades together, videlicet God and the deuyll.
ANd after ye haue this substa~ cially aduysed counsayled with your selfe, it shalbe necessary that you co~pare confer together the two disagreyng and farre vnlyke heades and capitaynes, god and the deuyll, by synne thou makest the one thine ennemie and the other thy lord and master.
By innocency and grace of god art ascrybed into the number and lender of the frendes of god· and adopted vnto the ryght and hytage of the chyldren of god.
But by synne thou arte made and constituted the seruaunte and sonne of the deuyll.
The one is that eternall sprynge and fountayne, verye image of the highest beautie, gretest pleasure and moste excellente goodnes, comynge and deuyding him selfe to all men.
The other is father and auctour to al vices, extreme myschiefe, and greatest infe licitie.
Remember the goodnesse and benefites of god towarde the, remember also the malyce and mis chiefe of the deuyll.
Consyder by how great goodnes almighty god dyd create thee.
Howe mercyfully he redemed thee. howe lyberally he hath indued thee: How gentyl ly he ereth and susteyneth thee dayly ffendynge and displeasyng his goodnes, howe ioyfully he recueth the, amending thine offen ces. Co~trary cal diligently to thy reme~braunce, howe enuiously the dyuyll hatyth thy helthe, in what miserie and wretchednes, he hath in time past deiected the, and how he dailye labourith to bringe man to eternal dampnation.
And after thou haste diligentlie ponderyd comparyd these thinges in thy remembraunce thinke farther with thy selfe after this maner.
Shall vnkindly and vnnaturally, forgetfull of my beginning, forgetful of so great benefites towards me, for so little and vaine pleasure, for sake so noble, so louinge, so beneficiall a father, and geue my selfe in bondage to so enuious, and cruel a master? shal not render vnto my maker creatoure almyghty god that thing, whiche shame bindeth me to render vnto a man, beynge good beneficial vnto me? Shal not abhorre and fiye the deuyll, whiche naturally doth flie a man, being hurtfull and euyll vnto me.
Rule for the absteining from synne is to haue in oure remembraunce the myseryes of thys worlde.
FUrthermore haue dilygently in your reme~braunce, how ful of trouble and wretchednes, how fraile and vncertaine this present life is.
And diuers times sodenly and vnware oppresseth man, when no man is suer to lyue one moment or instant of an houre howe peryllous ieoperdous it is to defer or prolonge that life (that is to say to continue in sinne) in the whiche if sodayne death (as it many times hapneth) apprehend or take thee, thou diest eternally.
For asmuch as of so great a company verye fewe trewly, and with all their harte, ryse agayne from sin.
Specially such as prolonge and defer theyr contynuance in synne, to the later ende of their lif.
The discence and fal vnto syn is very slipper and easie, but it is harde and great difficulty to ascend againe from sinne.
And therfore it shalbe very necessary to euery christen man, before he discend vnto the depe pit dungion of syn.
That he diligently reme~ber that the returne againe fro~ sinne is very harde and laborous.
And that he cannot without speci al grace ryse againe at pleasure.
Here folowith certaine speciall remedies, against certaine speciall vices and sinnes, and first against Lechery.
HYtherto after my sim ple and grose maner, haue declared vnto you certaine generall remedies against all kynd of vice commonly.
Nowe af ter my capacitie lernyng, shal also prescrybe vnto you certayne specyall remedyes by the whyche you may be the more able to with stand the. vii. pryncipall or dedly synnes.
And fyrst agaynst the syn of lechery, for asmuch as this syn of al other so much inuadith man, most sharply assautith him, and is most common and bryngith moste men to dystruccyon and myschefe.
And therefore if this fylthy pleasure prycke or inflame thy sowle, reme~ber continuallye to arme thy selfe with this armoure, and to re sist it.
First call to thy reme~brance howe impuer, how beastly how greatly vnbeseming and vncomly vnto man, this fonde pleasure and voluptuousnes is, which equalith vs the creature and unage of allmighty god, vnto the vilest of the brute and vnresonable beastes, as swine, dogges, gotes such other, and not onely equallethe vs vnto them, but bryngeth and deiecteth vs far vnder their condicyon and degre, which be preordinate to the company of angelles, and fruition of diuinitie.
Remember also how shorte and deceitfull this pleasure is, hauing alway, much more bitternes then delectacion and pleasuer.
Contrary consider how precious a thing the soule is, howe excellent the body of man is, accor ding as haue shewed you in the generall rules.
What fondnes is it then, for so fylthy delectacion of so vnsure and vnstable pleasure, so vngoodlely to polute, bothe body and soule, and to defyle that temple or suspende it: the which oure sauiour Iesu christ did consecrate to him self with his most precious bloud.
Consider also, what company of greuous inco~moditys and displeasures, foloweth this flattering pestilence, and couert poison.
First it taketh away from a man, his good name fame, for be thou assuryd the rumour of Lechery is much more abhominable, then of any other vice.
It consumeth also and wasteth the substance and patrimony of mans body: it kylleth and destroieth both strengthe and bewty of the body.
It hurteth and hindereth the healthe of the body, ingendreth dyuers sycknes and lothely soores, it hastneth age before a due tyme, and debateth the flowre and lustines of youthe: It dulleth the quicknes and felicitie of the witte: it withdraweth the minde of man from al vertuous honest occupacions or studies: and drowneth him so in durt and filthi nesse, that he hath no pleasure to think or remember any thing, but such as is filthy beastly and vyle.
Finally it takithaway that thing which is the very properte of ma~, and by the which only ma~ is man, that is to say, the vse of reason.
It pulleth out or extirpeth the godly mynd, infundeth a beastly mind, it causith youthe to be infamous, wyld, vnruly, age to be suspectyd, myserable and lothelye.
Beware therfore and refrayn thy self from thys fond voluptuousnes, by the exaumple of other whom thou hast known or hard, by such lewde nes, to haue fallen into sycknesse, pouertie, and misery.
And corage or stomake thy selfe to the vertue of chastitie, by the exaumple of so many younge women lusty men which thou shalt rede in histories very tenderly brought vp and delicately norished, to haue kept cha stitie.
Why shouldest thou not do that thing which they did, and no doubte thou shalte do as they did.
Remember with thy selfe how flo rishing, how pleasaunt, and honest a thing the chastitie and cleannes of minde and of the body is, which maketh vs familiar with the angelles, and pleasant vessels of the holy ghost.
Be thou insured the de uine spirite and holy ghoste, most faithful louer of chastitie and clen nes, fleith noo vice so greatly, as the vice of vncleannes, ne delighteth or resteth any where so gladly, as in puer and virginall members.
Consider howe vncomelye, how folishe beastly it is to loue fondely, to waxe pale, to be leane, to wepe and lament, to flatter and speake fayre, to be lowly and plyante to a stinking harlot: to singe all nyght at her gates or doores, and to depend at the commaundement of your fonde mystres, to be vnder the gouernaunce of a lyght and leude woman, to complayne to be angry, and sode~ly to be agre ed agayne, to suffer thy selfe wylfully to be deluded, to be beaten, to be spoyled and vtterly to kyll thy soule for the co~tentacion of a leude woman.
Where is amonge these thinges the name of a man? wher the reme~brance of the berd? wher that honest and ientil mind, borne and predestinate to noble acts and goodly matters? Consyder also what flocke and company of vices foloweth this beastelye pleasure comitted and vsid.
If it seme but light to followe this wantonnesse and pleasure of the body, yet reme~ ber with thy selfe howe great and greuous an offence it is to be disobedient to thy parentes, to dispise the holsom admonitions and cou~celles of thy frendes: to consume prodigally dispend thy substa~ce and heritage, to take diceitfully other mennes goodes, to forswere thy selfe wyllingly, to drynke all riotousely, to chide and braule, to be a quareller, to fight, to commit homicide, to blaspheme and slaunder.
Into the whiche and worse, this filthy beastly pleasure shal deiecte thee, if she once ouercome the, and thou become her seruant.
Consider furthermore, how fraile and vncertain this present life is, and how diuers ways death lieth in waite, from whose violence no time, no place, maye defende thee.
Remember the suertie and ryghtuosnes of the last iudgement, and that feareful sentence neuer to be reuoked, goe you cursed people into the eternal fier of hel.
And how this little short vayne pleasure, shal vndoutedly be punished with eternall punishment.
Remember that thy good aungell deputed to be thy keper is alway present, beholdinge and testifyenge all that thou thinkest or doest.
Remember that almighty god also beholdeth the, vnto whose sight, all thinges be open.
And shalte thou not be ashamed to do yc thing in the sighte of almighty god, and all the company of heauen, which thou arte a+shamed to do in the sight of man.
Beleue plainly that if thou hadst a thousand eies, were as quicke of sighte as the Egle, yet couldest thou not more clerely se that thi~g which man dothe in thy presence, then almighty god plainely seeth the secrets and inwardes of thye minde and harte.
And to be briefe the speciallest and surest remedye against the te~ptacions of the flesh, be these.
First diligently to auoide and flye all such occasion and company, as soliciteth and moueth to the said vice.
Thirde temperaunce and abstinence from temptacion and pleasures permit ted and suffered.
Finally the reme~+brance of death and contemplacion of the pashion, and punishment of Christ.
It shal also greatly pro+fyt thee against the sayde temptacion, to liue kepe company with such as be chast, vertuous, and honest.
And to fle and auoide corrupt and vnchast communicacion: to fle idelnes and trifling occupacions, to occupy thy minde busely with honeste studies and meditacion of heauenly matters.
Specially, to exercise and vse thy selfe in reding of holy scripture.
IF thou perceue that thou art eyther of nature propence and disposed to the sinne of couetouse, or else intised and moued to the same, of the ennemy the deuil, reme~ber the noblenes and dignitie of thy condi ion, and that thou arte only creatyd redemyd to this vse, to haue the possessyon of the ioy celestiall, and eternall fruycion of almyghtye god: And that he creatyd and formyd all this worlde to thy vse and commoditie.
Howe vncomely is it the~ and how filthi, not to vse and dispose these earthely dounge and vile thinges: but so greatly to loue and kepe them.
Take awaye the erronious opinion of men, and what shal golde and siluer be, but red and white earthe· Shalt not thou beinge the disciple and member of Christ, chosen and electe to so great possession heritage, dispise that thing· which commonly all the gen ad vnchristen philosophers, didde despise and set at naughte.
It is not honourable to haue richesse, but to despise them.
But here the most parte of theym which be called christen, most sub telly and craftely disceiuing them selfe, obiecteth and sayeth, necessity co~pelleth and causeth vs to gather possessions and richesse: and when we haue gotten the~ to kepe them dilygentely: For in case we haue nothing we can not liue, and if our substaunce be but smale: our life shall be more incommodiouse and full of displeasures: but if we haue aboundance and plenty of riches, then maye we liue quietlye and more commodiously, hauinge wherwith to preserue our health, and remedy oure sicknesse: to prouide for our children, to helpe our frendes.
Finally so shall we cease to be in contempte, and be in reputacion and fame amonge other.
But vnto these which by pretence of necessitie, excuse their couetous: shall obiecte the parable of the Lillies, and birdes mencioned in the gospel: which onely liue with that, which they finde redy, vnto whose Imitacion our sauiour moueth and exhorteth vs.
shal also obiecte vnto them, that our sayde sauioure aboue all thynges commaundeth vs to get the kingdome of heauen, promisinge that soo doinge all thinges necessary shal be plentifullye ministred vnto vs.
When haue they lacked necessaries, whiche with all their hartes hath folowed vertue? How littell is it that nature desireth of vs? But thou madde man, doeste not measure the necessitie of the vse of nature, but of the satisfyinge and end of thy insaciable and couetous minde.
To vertuous and good me~ that little whiche contnteth nature is sufficient.
But he whiche consumeth the gretest part of his life in gatherynge of ryches, and hordeth and kepeth theym as the anker and suertie of his liuynge: paradunture he maye be calleda good and a wise marchante.
But can not thinke hym a good chri sten man, whiche only trusteth to him selfe: and mistrusteth the promises of our sauiour Christ, whiche when he of his goodnes, so louingely fedeth, and clotheth sparrowes and birdes of the ayer: shal he leaue man destitute and vnprouided for, whiche trusteth in his goodnes· But let vs now expend and consider the profites and commodyties, whiche these ryches be thought of dyuers to bringe vnto man.
Fyrst by the common assente of all philosophers, riches among wordely thinges counted profitable, be set in the laste place.
And when all thynges after the deuision of the philosopher named Epictet, except vertue only: be with out man, nothynge is so moche to be counted without Man as money: ne nothynge so little commodiouse and profytable.
For in case one man dyd possesse, al the riches and iewels of the world: shuld he therefore be more vertuous, more wise, or more learned? Shoulde his mynde or sowle thereby any thinge, be the better: shoulde the health of his body be more prospe rous? Can his money make hym more bewtiful, stronger, or younger? But here some worldly parsonne will saye, money causeth a man to be regarded, and purchaseth honoure.
But what honoure is that, which money causeth, truly false and deceiuable, and suche they onely geue, whiche honoure is nothinge but trifles, and vanities, of whom to be commendid, is plainely discommendable, and to be rebuked: trewe honour is to be laweded and praysed of suche as be laudable.
Trewe honour and commendation is the rewarde of vertue, not of richesse.
And when the people do honour a man for his riches and apparell, they honour the riches and the ap parell, not the manne.
And if they might, as well perceaue the miserable pouertie and nakydnesse of the sowle, as they perceaue and see the outwarde aparell and substaunce, they woulde then iudge him as wretchid and vnfortunate as they nowe call him happy and blessed in this worlde, and as muche despise him, as they nowe do him reuerence and honoure.
And as for the frendshyppe and amitie whyche men of this worlde thynkethe that money obteynethe and getteth, trewly it is false and deceitful: for money purchaseth fren des to it selfe, not to him that possesseth the mony, so that they whi+che loue a man for his money, be frendes not to the man.
And therfore thincke them whiche be richest in this case most vnhappye: that they ca~not discerne ne knowe their frendes from their foes: For of them whiche pretende loue and frendshippe, towardes the ryche man: Some priuily hateth hym, as to gredy and couetous, some en uieth him, because he is more rich, and of more substaunce then they, And some regardynge their owne profytte and lucre, flatterth him and vpholdeth his doinges sayinges, to the intent they maye get somwhat of him: and he that most pretendeth frendshippe before his face, wold fainest haue him dead.
And againe, the riche man commonly hath all men suspected.
Iudginge them as vultures, gapinge for their praye, and thynkynge that they resorte vnto him onely, for their owne lure and ad uauntage, not for his loue frend shippe.
And therfore, if thou dilygently po~der and aduise with thy selfe, the maner of getting and kepinge of this money, thou shalte plainly perceue, that abundaunce and plenty of riches, bringeth vnto man muche more incommodyties and disprofites, then profites and commodities.
How great labour and payne sufferethe man in gettynge of this rychesse.
Howe great feare and disquietnes, hath he in kepinge of them.
What heauines and sorow, in lesing of the~? Trewly man can not wel expresse it.
And therfore our sauiour in the gospell calleth them thornes, because they take from manne, that thing whiche is moste pleasaunt, that is to saye, quietnes and tranquilitie of the minde: and vexe and distrouble man with dyuerse crakes and dysquietnesse.
And the more they are possessed and obteined, the more they inflame moue manne to gather and keepe them.
And this insaciable and gredy desyre casteth man hedlinge into diuerse kinde of vices, and into muche mischefe.
Disceaue not thy self good Christin man, fondely beleuynge, that thou maiest easely be bothe riche and parfectly deuoute.
It is muche more easie and lighte that a Camell shoulde passe throughe the eye of a nedle, then a ryche man to come into the kingdome of heauen.
Remember the saieng of saint Iherome, great aboundaunce and plenty of riches can not be both gathered and kept without synne.
Remember also, that riches and substaunce of this worlde, robbythe and dyspoyleth the of much better riches.
For he that hath pleasure and felicitie in money, can not but hate vertu and honeste occupations.
Fynally remember that saincte Paule in his Eepistels calleth the sinne of auarice playnely Idolatrye, and that thou canst not both serue god, and intend to thy riches.
And that as thou, nakyd dydde come into this world, so shalt thou hence departe againe nakyd.
Haue also alwaye in thy remembraunce the folyshe ryche man spoken of in the gospel, vnto who~ it was said, this nighte thou shalt dye, and who shall then haue this substaunce and richesse, which thou hast gathered? Withdrawe thy minde diligently from the corrupte maners and behauioure of the common people, vnto the contemplacion of the pouertye of the blessed vyrgin Marye, the apostells, the marters, and of thy capytayn Christ, and euer remem ber, that fearefull interminaion, whiche almyghty god threatneth in scripture to the riche me~ of this world, and it shall cease and slake thy gredy apetite of couetousnes.
ANd if the synne of Ambycion with hys inchauntementes and charmes, moue and attempte thye sowle, arme and defende thy selfe with these remedys.
Fyrste dilygently remember, accordyngly as haue shewyd you before, that perfyt and trewe honoure onely procedeth of vertue, and is onely lawde and commendation, for vertuous behauioure and maners.
And yet this honour is not to be desired, as our sauiour Ihesu Chryste hath taughte vs, bothe by exaumple of his liuinge, and also by his doctryne and teachynge.
For the very trewe honour and commendation to be desyred of a christen manne, is to be commended and honouryd of almighty god, and not of men.
As sainct Paule witnesseth in his pistell to the Hebrewes, sayinge.
This honour and reuerence whiche men comonly geue vnto man, if it be geuen for a thing vnhonest and vicious, it is not to be cou~ted honour, but greate rebuke, and if it be geuen for thinges whiche be meane, and of theym selfe nother vertuous ne vicoius, as bewtye, strengthe, ryches, kynred, and suche other, yet is it not to be counted trew honour: For no man can deserue honour by that thinge: for the whiche he is not worthy to be commendid.
But if man be had in reuerence and honoure for his ver tuouse behauiour and honestie: Then is it to be counted trew honoure.
And yet he that deserueth this honour shall not vtterly desyre and couet it, but be contentyd with his vertuouse demeanoure and concyence, or knowledge of his good dede.
For what thynge can be more fonde, then a man to esteame hym selfe vpon the opinion and fantasy of men: which haue at pleasure, and at their owne lyberty to take awaye that honoure and reuerence whiche they gaue, and to dishonest them which they haue reuerencyd before.
And therfore nothing maye be more folishe then to reioyse or be proude of suche honours, when they be geuen.
Or to be troubled or dysquyeted, when they be taken awaye.
Whiche honoures you shal by this argumente speciallye perceaue to be false, that they commonly happen to such as be worste, and moste vicious.
Remember howe gracious and blessed the quietnes and tranquilitie of meane priuate lyfe is, whiche is not incombrid with am bicion of honour.
Remember how carefull and ful of troubles, howe daungerous, and full of ieoperdies the life of great men, and men called honourable is.
How great diffyculte is it in prosperitie and wealthe, a man not to forget his imbesilitie and weakenesse, howe harde and laborous is it for a ma~ to stande in a flypper and flydynge waye, and not to fal· howe ieoper dous and deadly the fall is, from great height.
Finally remember that to all honoure and worldely auctoritie is annexed and conioyned greate bourden and bondage.
Remember also howe rightewise and iuste the last iudgement of almighty god shall be, vppon theim whiche are desyrous of honoures and reuerence of this worlde, exteme them selues here, hyghe aboue other.
For it is wrytten, he that submitteth and hu~bleth hym selfe, lyke as the infante and vnurtefull childe doth, shal obteine mercy and fauoure of almyghtye god.
And he that ambiciouslye desireth honoure, and preheminence aboue all other, shall be secluded from the grace and fauour of god.
Haue diligentely in thye remembraunce the example of thy master and capitaine Christ, then the whi che nothing was more dispised, ne lesse honored, and counted vile as to this worlde: Whiche when he was far aboue all dygnities, and worldly auctorities, refused reue+rence and honour of this worlde.
Remember howe little he regarded the pompe and honoure of this worlde, whiche entered the moste noble and regall citie of the Iues, syttinge vpon a poore and symple asse, not gorgeouselye decked, ne pompeousely arayed, and that he couerid with a pore and vile pall, crouned with a crown of sharpe thornes, vtterly condempned the pompe of this worlde.
Remember how vile and ignominus a deathe he didde elect and chuse.
But him that the world dispised, the father omnipotente did glorefye and honour.
Let thy honour and glory, good christen man, be in the crosse and passion of Christe, in the whiche also thy healthe and saluation is conteyned: for what shal it profite the to be honoured of men, and reiected and despysed of almighty God.
YOu shall ceasse to be prowde and disdainful in mind, if you according to the olde and auncient prouerbe, laboure diligentely to haue perfyt and substancial know ledge of your selue.
That is to say if you exteeme all suche thynges as you shall perceaue in your elfe excellente, vertuous, good, and commendable, receyued onely of almyghtye god, as his free gyfte and rewarde: And contrarye all that is vile, euyl, and vicious, to come of thy selfe and to be thyne: and you remember, in howe great wretchednes you were conceyued nd borne, howe naked, howe nedy, howe destitute of knowledge, and howe myserable, you entered into this worlde, howe apte and disposed the bodye is to sycknesse, howe greuousely incombred with chaunces and troubles, and howe little aduersitie maye debate and distroie this pride and hautinesse.
It shall profyte you also to call to remembraunce what thynge that is, whereof you so highely reioyce in your self.
And if it be but meane not vicious, ne vertuous, then it is great folishenes to be proude of that thynge, wherof thou hast no suertie: if it be vicious, then is it extreme madnes, to reioyse of that whiche is verye odious.
And if it be vertuous, yet is it vnkyndnes, not to thanke god of that, whiche he hath gyuen thee.
But to repute it as thyne own, and to be prowde of that thing which thou hast not deserued.
Finally remember that Pryde and Disdayne is the moste euidente and suer token of folishenes, and the thynge moste hated, and enuied bothe of god and man.
And therfore when you feele your selfe moued or inflamyd to pryde, remember dilygentely, what you are in your selfe, a thinge corruptible in the begynnynge, variable and inconstante in all your lyfe, after your lyf, wormes meate and dust.
Remember also what Christ was made for youre sake, and it shall doubte not, represse youre Pride.
remedy againste the sinne of Anger and desyre of reuengeaunce.
WHEN vehement displeasure of the mynde moueth and exytethe you to be reuenged, re member substauncially that anger is nothing lesse, the~ that thinge which she counterfayteth, that is to saye, strength and fortitude.
Reme~ber also, that anger is a femynine affection, urye seming the constancy of man. nd that it is a plaine euident to of a childishe feble stomake, to reioyce of uengeaunce.
Thou thynkeste to be counted bolde and coragious, if thou sufferest not iniurie vnreuenged, but by this mea nes thou doest declare thy weake nes and chyldyshenes, that thou hast nopower to moderate or temper thy mynde or appetite, which is the very propertie and token of a manne.
Howe muche more commendable and manly is it to despise the lightenes or folishenes of other, then to folowe it, the more hurtefull, the more cruell and sekynge of quarels, thou shalte perceaue thy ennemye to be the more dyligentely laboure that thou be not made equal and like vntohim.
For what maddenesse is it to reuenge thee of a nother mannes lewdenes, and to make thye selfe thereby more lewde and vicious.
If you despise the iniurie and con tumely of youre ennemie, and be not moued and distroubled therewith, then shall it plainely appere that you haue not deserued it: but if you be angrye and moued therewith, then make you his cause the better whiche didde the iniurye.
Remember also, that iniurye and displeasure is not quenched ne cea sed, by reuengeaunce: but rather newe kindeled and increased, and what conclusion or ende shall be of displeasures, if euery man shuld couet to be reuenged.
By desire of reuengeaunce and continuance in anger, ennemies increaceth in bothe parties, and the dyspleasure, continuallye reneweth in the stomake, the whiche the more olde it is, the more it is vncurable.
But by sufferaunce and pacience, he is often tymes wonne whiche hath done displeasure, and by remembraunce of him selfe of an ennemie made a suer and stedfaste frende.
Furthermore it shal greatly quen che and slake your a~ger if in other mennes offences and displeasures toward you ye diligently remember, how greuousely and howe often, you haue offended god, and in howe greate daunger you are vnto his goodnes.
As you remytte the offences and dyspleasures of other men towarde you, soo shall almightye god, pardon you youre offences towardes him.
Forgeue therefore youre neyghboure his lyghte and small offences towardes you (For it is but lyghte that man can committe againste man) and almightye god shall pardone you the greate multitude of your sinnes.
He wil not refuse the lawe that he hath made and ordeyned.
And if you thinke it harde and of greate difficultie, to represse thye furiouse and angrye mynde.
Remember that Chryst sufferyd muche more hardenes and payne for your sake.
What were you when he renderyd and payde his precious lyfe for youre offences? were you not his ennemy? howe pacientely dothe he suffer you dayely offending and renewing your olde synnes.
If you desire or couet to be the member of Christ, you must followe the pacience and charitie of Christ.
You can not haue Christ mercifull vnto you, if you vse crueltie and extreame iustice toward your neighbour.
Therefore when you shall fele youre selues mouyd to angre, if you can not vtterly op presse and subdewe this affection, at the leaste, so moderate and refraine your selfe, that you maye haue remembraunce, that you be not in perfect and good memorie.
Beleue not youre felfe, when you be angrye, but haue all thynges suspected, vnto the which, the irefull affection, shall moue and intise you, althoughe they be honest.
Remember, howe many thinges, you haue sayde, or done in anger, of the whiche you after repented you and willed to amende theim.
Remember that betweene Anger and frenesie is no dyfference, but that the oone is a perpetuall furor and maddenes, the other temporall, and but for a season.
And if you further desyre by experience to haue knowledge howe vnbecomely and vnseeminge vnto man it is to be ouercom of anger, when you be wel aduised and quiet.
Beholde the countenaunce and gesture of him that is angrye, or beholde youre selfe in your anger at a glasse, and when you shall perceyue the eyes flamynge as fyer, the cheekes pale and wanne, the lyppes fomynge lyke a Bore, the face dystorted and oute of facyon, the other members trymblynge and quakinge, the voice furyouse, the gesture inconstante and oute of order, you shall playnely confesse that it is more like a cruell a sauage beaste, then like a man.
And if you be of Nature propence and disposed to this vice, you shall the more diligently vse and accustome your selfe not to be angry, and to do and saye nothyng when you be disquietid.
And as haue shewed you in one or two vyces for an example, so shall you do in all other, specially in such as you shal know youre selfe inclined vnto eyther of nature or custome, and agaynste their assaultes, write certaine rules, in the secreates of your minde and often renewe them, leaste by disuse they be forgotten.
And in· struct prepare your mynde with praier, fastyng reding of holy scrip ture, exaumple of holy and vertuouse men, and specially of your Capitaine Christe, and so doinge you shalbe more able to withstand vice, and more redy to fulfill the commaundementes of Christ, To whom be eternall laude and commendation.

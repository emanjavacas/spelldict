good ale for my money

the resolution of strong ale that cures his nose from looking pale

to the tune of the countrey lasse

be merry my friends and list a while vnto a merry iest it may from you produce a smile when you heare it exprest
of a young man lately married which was a boone good fellow this song in's head he alwaies carried when drinke had made him mellow

cannot go home nor will not go home its long of the oyle of barly ile tarry all night for my delight and go home in the morning early

no tapster stout or vintner fine quoth he shall euer get one groat out of this purse of mine to pay his masters debt why should deal with sharking rookes that seeke poore gulls to cozen to giue twelue pence for a quart of wine of ale twill buy a dozen

twill make me sing cannot

the old renowned ipocrist and raspie doth excell but neuer any wine could yet my honour please to swell
the rhenish wine or muskadine sweet malmsie is too fulsome no giue me a cup of barlie broth for that is very wholesome

twill make me sing cannot

hot waters ar to me as death and soone the head oreturneth and nectar hath so strong a breath canary when it burneth it cures no paine but breaks the braine and raps out oathes and curses and makes men part with heauie heart but light it makes their purses

cannot go home

some say metheglin beares the name with perry and sweet sider twill bring the body out of frame
and reach the belly wider which to preuent am content with ale thats good and nappie
and when thereof haue enough
thinke my selfe most happy

cannot go home

all sorts of men when they do meet both trade and occupation with curtesie each other greet and kinde humiliation a good coale fire is their desire whereby to sit and parly theyle drinke their ale and tell a tale and go home in the morning early

cannot go home

your domineering swaggering blades and caualiers that flases that throw the iugs against the walls and break in peeces glasses when bacchus round cannot be found they will in merriment drinke ale and beere and cast of care and sing with one consent

cannot goe home

the second part

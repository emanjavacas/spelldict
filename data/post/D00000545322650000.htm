Not verie pleasant at the first view to many men, but yet most necessarie, profitable and commodious for all sorts of people of what estate, dignity, or calling soeuer they be.
With an Exhortation to good life annexed: Wherein are treated all such things at appertaine vnto a Christian to do, from the beginning of his conuersion, vntill the end of his perfection.
Made by I. B. Printed at London by R. F. for Iohn Oxenbridge, dwelling at the signe of the Parrat in Paules churchyard.
YOu carelesse youth looke well on me, For as am, so shall you be: am the wight, at length that must Lay all your glorie in the dust: Tis I, tis I, that giues the fall To one, though neere so tall: No wealth, no strength, nor pollicie Can make resistance vnto me.
Wherefore let this be still your song, Dead shall be, ere it be long.
YE gallant Dames, behold your doome, To this at length you all must come: Though neere so fine, you are but dust, Though neere so loath, away you must: daunt your pride, pull your plumes, To stench turne, your sweet perfumes: Your Rings, your Chaines, your rich aray, Yea life and all take away.
Let this therefore cke your song, Dead shall be, ere it be long.
Let euerie man, if he be wife, Though he be not exprest by name.
With indgement deep, and good aduise, Mark wel this Glasse: for in the same perfect picture painted is, Of euerlasting bale or blis.
Most sure we are, that we must die, But when, or how, God only knowes: ten times happie then, say I, Is he that well his time best owes: But wo to him ten thousand fold, Who~ death as prisoner fast doth hold.
THat we must all once die, there is no Athiest so incredulous, nor no foole so se~celesse,
but doth know and confesse the same; being compelled thereunto, not only by the authority of the holy Scriptures and learned Fathers, but also by dayly and howerly experience.
dust we are into dust we must needs returne againe, we all must die, and sinke into the ground like waters, which returneth not againe:
Man that is borne of a woman, faith Iob, hath, but a short time to line, and that litle time also that he hath is replenished with manifold miseries, his daies be short,
the hower of death is vncertaine, the nu~ber of his moneths are set downe which hee cannot passe, but when they are complete, there is no remedy but die he must: Quis est homo qui viuit non videbit mortem: What man is he that liueth and shall not die? surely not one, for al flesh is but Grasse,
and all our glory but as the Flowers of the field, which to day flourish and to morrow
when Death commeth with his Siclein hand to haue in his haruest, he looketh not on the greene and flourishing yeares of young Ganimedes, he regardeth not the Purple robes of Senatours, nor passeth not a straw for Cresus yellow crownes,
he feareth not the force of Mars, nor subtility of Mercurie: neither Caesar, nor Alexander, could resist him, neither Salomon nor lisses beguile him.
Neque salunb impium, neither shall the wickednesse of the wicked helpe him, but downe he must amongst the rest: Grasse we are,
and as Grasse will he mow vs, all haue sinned, and for sin we all must die.
It is decreed that all must once die, but woe to him that dieth twise, the first death parteth
the second death seperateth both body soule from God, the first depriueth vs of temporall pleasures,
Well may we all stand in feare of death: for in what state he findeth vs,
in that estate shall we be presented before the tribunall seate of God: neither shall we when we depart cary any thing with vs but our good deeds and our bad; naked came we into the world,
naked must we depart again, when we are dead, there is no difference at all betweene one Carkasse and another,
vnlesse perchaunce the rich mans Corse stinke more vilely then the poore mans doth, neither doth it make much to the matter, whether we haue liued te~ or
ten hundred yeares, for when our glasse is run out, and ineuitable death is come, all is one in effect,
but that he that hath liued longest, shall haue the greater burthen of sin to beare and the more to account for: much better is it to liué a little while and vertuously,
then a thousand yeres wickedly: better is one day to a wise and learned man, then a very long life to him that liueth lewdly and followeth his sensualities.
But what make so much a do, to proue so plaine a matter by so many authorities of sacred Scriptures and holy Fathers? the very heathens themselues that knew not God, do in their writings confesse the same;
aske Plato what he thinketh of this life, and he will answere you, Sapientum vita meditatio
est mortis, that is, the life of wise men ought to be a perpetuall meditation of death, which will come, nothing more sure, but when and how, no man cant tell,
aske Seneca his iudgement herein, and he will not only confirme that haue sayd, but proue it by experience.
Certum est (faith he) vitam mortémque per vices ire composit a dissolui, dissolut a componi, omne humanum genus quodcunque est, quodcunque erit morte damnatum est, &c.
It is certaine, that life and death come and go by turnes: things made and compounded are to be dissolued, and being dissolued are to be made againe.
All generations of men whatsoeuer are or shall be condemned to die, and the Cities that now are builded shall one day decay,
and men shall aske, where stood such a towne? And againe, Morior nec primus nec vltimus, omnes me antecesserunt, omnes sequente hac conditione intraui, vt exirem.
All those that liued before me, are dead gone before me, and all that are to come shall follow me.
that should depart againe: And as long as liue dayly die, for some part of my time doth daly shorten, and as my yeares increase, so doth my life decrease, our Infancie, our childhood, and all our youth, euen vnto yesterday is lost, all our time passed is perished, euen this very day we dined with death.
And as olde age commeth after youth, so death followeth old age.
for thou knowest not in what corner death doth lie in waite for thee: and seeing thou knowest not where he lurketh, it were good for thee to expect him euery hower, and suspect him euery where.
he is alwayes to be feared: for what hower is secure from death? yet to the end thou maist not feare death, be thou alwayes mindfull of him: Thus farre Seneca. who though he were a heathen, may set vs all to schoole.
keycold Catholike! negligent Christian! how canst thou heare this without blushing? how art thou not confounded to thinke hereupon? Shall Infidels that know nor God, teach thee to liue like a Christian? shall heathe as that neither
hoped for heauen or feared hell, teach vs how to liue die well? what can we say to this? surely feare me much, that as they are our schoolemaisters now in this point, so shall they be our accusers and iudges at the latter day: they expected no reward after this life, yet dayly indeuored to liue and die well, and we that beleeue that there is a most iust and vpright Iudge, that shall reward the good with euerlasting glorie, and the bad with perpetuall paines, neuer or very seldome thinke on death, but liue as if there were no such
Epigraph: Heu vit homines tanquans mors nullu sequatur, Et velut Infernum fabula vana for.
Men liue and yet beleeue not, that death shall ouer take them: The paines of hell they feare not, But fables they do make them.
What great commoditie commeth vnto man by continuall meditation and memorie of death.
Remember man that thou art but dust, and into dust shalt thou returne againe, nothing so much daunteth the pride of man, as the remembraunce of his base beginning, and miserable ending.
If we remember what we were in our mothers wombe, we cannot but blush for shame, If we consider what
we are now, we shall find many causes to weepe lament, and if we die, way well what we shall shortly be, we should both tremble and quake for feare: Our beginning was such as with honestie it cannot be named, our present state so full of miseries as no man can number them, and our passage out of this life so painefull and perillous, as no tongue can tell or pen expresse the same: men would thinke hereupon,
Ah God, how many thousand soules lie now broiling and burning in hell, cursing banning, that euer they were borne, and all for want of these considerations, which had they remembred, they might perhaps haue bin happie
The memory of death is a most precious preseruatiue against all pestilent deseases of the soule, and a present remedy for all sicknesse of sin whatsoeuer.
The memory of death is the mother of humilitie, the nurse of all vertues, the bane of pride, and step dame of al vices.
The memory of death purgeth all misdemeanour, dissolute and light behauiour, and preserueth vs from all hainous crimes and enormities whatsoeuer.
Memor are nouissima tua (faith Salomon in aeternum non peccabis.
As for example, who could take pride to behold him selfe in a Glasse, or to looke vppon his straite and well set
legges, or to heare himselfe commended for his comlinesse of person, if hee remembred that: Adhuc pusillum non erit peccatum, sed in modica fossa computresoenti ossa.
After a little while sinfull man must die, and then he shall be put into a little hole of the ground, where both flesh and bones shall rot and consume to nothing.
Or who would be delighted to heare himselfe prattle, or glorie in his ready and pregnant wit, if he did bethinke him, that Post hominem vermes, post vermem foetor, sic in non hominem vertitur omnis homo.
Shortly, perhaps to morrow, perhaps to day his tongue shall falter, his voyce decay, his memory faile him, his wits forsake him, and he of a man become wormes
meate, and that which the Magottes shall refuse, shall rot stinke most horribly.
Who could glory of his noble parentage, or bragge of worshipful predecessors, if he did remember that, Post miserum funus vmbra sumus.
Surely if we did with the eyes of our consideration, looke well into their graues, we should find greater matter of confusion then of glory.
And if we did enter some what deeper into the matter, way in what estate their poore soules be in hell, we should, doubt not, haue greater cause to quake and tremble, then to bragge and boast of such auncestors.
Where are now Alexander the great, Antiochus, Herod and other such, whose surpassed so farre, as they we
not ashamed to take on them the title of gods? yea where are those gods themselues, Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Mertury, Bacchus, Uenus, luno, and the rest: where are they? their diuine flesh and bones are turned into dirt and dust,
Where are now all those Caesars and Senatours of Rome, who so many yeares together commaunded all the world, and ruled all the rost? where are now all those heathen kings, that in auncient times commaunded men and beasts, which recreated themselues with the birds and foules of the aire, which put their trust and confidence in gold siluer, and neuer were satisfied in hoording vp of riches? Exterminati sunt, ad inferos descendunt,
They are extermined perished and descended into hell, and others are risen their roome.
They passed the dayes in all kind of dalliance delights, in a trise into the gulfe of euerlasting griefe, where perpetuall torments and eternall horror doth inhabite and remaine.
And who would set by worldly mucke and pelfe, if remembred these words of Sauiour: Thou foole, this shall they take thy soule fro thee, and the goods that tho hast gathered together, who shall they be? Or who would no feare to be clothed in Purple Veluet, and fare deliciously euery day, if he remembred poore Lazarus which died famine,
to heauen, and the rich glutton died and was buried in or thought vppon these words of Dauid:
The rich men leaue their goods to aliens and strangers, their graue must be their house for euer: Et vsque in eternum non videbunt lumen.
Lo here the last wil testame~t of worldly wise men, they giue their goods to strangers,
which spend them faster then they gathered them, many times go together by the cares for the same, the diuel hath their soules, and the wormes their bodies: miserable end! detestable testament! what wise men liuing would not wish rather to liue die with Lazarus then with the rich glutton?
What gaineth the Queenes moyles by their great burde~s of siluer, plate, other treasures
wherewith they are Surely nothing but a backe, for when they come the Inne, their treasure is take from them, and they naked, red and galled, as they be, turned into the stable.
So rich men gaine by their coffers, crammed Crownes, and sackes full of suer, but a conscience galled with many a crime, when life is at an they are by their friends ped to their skinne, and tyred, and galled as they thrust into the stinking of hell, where they shall sed worse then Moyles,
Moyles in the stable shall well dressed and curried, sed with prouender, and as much water as they drinke: but the worldly in hell shall find none to them, but millions of to torment them: they eate and gnaw their owne for hunger, and if they would giue tenne thousand for one little drop of water,
Wel, liue a worlding he that will, Moriatur anima mea Iustorum.
God graunt to die the death of Iust men, and during life to thinke continually thereupon: The memory of death maketh vs humble, meeke, lowly, obedient, charitable, louing, courteous, and benigne, obedient to our superiours, humble to our betters, lowly to our equals, meeke and benigne to our inferiours, subiects and seruants, charitable to the poore,
louing to our neighbours, courteous to all sorts of peop as well straungers as acquatance, poore as rich, foes friends.
The memory of death keth vs chast and continent, tient and peaceable, watch wise and warie, compunct contrite, it mitigateth all moderate affections, and lifieth all inordinate passions helpeth all diseases of the min and healeth all sicknesse of soule, it turneth into perfections, and of sinners maketh glorious Saints.
And to conclude, that attire themselues by Glasse, and spend their in meditating hereupon, generations shall call blessed: in die malae liber a sagitta
In the euill day God shall deliuer them from the arrow that flveth by day, fro~the busie diuell that walketh by night, from in cursion and from the diuell that walketh euen at noone day, he that continually expecteth death, cannot but liue well, and hee that liueth well must needs die well: hee therefore that desireth to liue and die well, let him beare well in mind that he is dust, and into dust he must returne again.
Although that which is already sayd concerning this matter, might suffice any wise man or woman in the world, and cause them to looke to themselues prepare for their dying day, yet for that know many to be of such grosse and dull capacity
as they cannot perceiue, or co~ceiue any thing, vnlesse it be such order set downe, as they may in a maner grope feel the fame, wil for their sakes set before their eyes, the lame~table complaint of one attached by death, long before hee looked for him or imagined him to by so neere: wishing all men that reade the same, grace and wisdom, by his exa~ple to beware least the like also happen vnto them, which God defend.
This man in the flower his time fell so sicke, as both Phisitions and all other his friends thought him but a dead man, willed him to prepare himselfe for God, the which when he heard, it did so ama him, as for a long time hee could not vtter one word, his griefe was so great, and his
feare so farre surpassed al measure: at the last with great abundance of teares, which like to litle streames trickled down his cheekes, he burst foorth into these or the like words following.
Ah cruell death, how hast thou intrapped me: how am entangled in thy snares, that thought my selfe farre out of thy reach? imagined that had yet many yeares to liue a long race to runne: but alas my Glasse is runne out, and my dayes are vanished like a shadow.
The feare of death hath oppressed me, in the gulfe of endlesse griefe am dre~ched, and the sorrowes of hell haue co~passed me about, and hemd me in on euery side,
no way to escape, but needs must end my dayes in deepe dispaire, and most extreame miserie:
my youthfull dayes are vanished like smoke, my bones are drie as stickes, my flesh withered like haye, my hart parched vp, for that haue forgotten to cate my meate; thus am suddenly brought to naught, that thought my selfe no small man in the view of the world.
Ah cursed world, wo be to me that euer followed thy vanities;
wo, wo, ten thousand times that euer knew Ah God, how happie had bi if had neuer bene borne
How happy if had dyed my mothers wombe, and carried from her bellie to my graue?
is the remembrance of thee vnto a man, whose pleasure and onely felicity is set on worldly vanities, as mine was? could neuer abide to thinke on thee, but now am inforced to feele thee to mine inexplicable paine and remedilesse griefe: would not hearken to those that gaue me good counsell, but counted them fooles, that liued continually looking for death, perswading my selfe that should liue Methusalems yeares.
But now alas, though it be late, find no foole in the world comparable to me: For Death at vnawares is rushed vppon me, he hath arested me, me with insolluble and draweth me to hell, euen as a drawe~th a condemned man to the gallowes; Helpe, helpe, helpe,
Father, Mother, Brethren, Sisters, Wife, Children, Friends, Kinsfolkes, helpe, helpe me, if euer you doe lone me, now helpe me: Misereminimei, mes, vos mes, Take pitty vpon me, take pittie vpon me,
at least you my especial good friends, take pitty vppon me, keepe me from murderer, defend from this terrible Tyger, preserue me from this ramping and roaring Lyon, which me in his pawes: and is die to teare me in pee
Alas, alas, will no man helpe what none? death spare pray thee take my lands let me liue, for the loue of Lord whome serue, lot alone for a yeare, for a neth, for a day, for an wer, giue me a little space
Tut, tut, thou art the child of Death, thou art condemned to die, thy hower is ended, and thou must die, no parents, no friends, no kindred, no treasure, no honour, no wit, no pollicie can preuaile or helpe thee a whit.
If thou wouldest giue me this world full of gold for one howers space, would not take it.
And if all the Kings, Queenes and Emperors that are now, or euer were in the world, should on their knees intreate for the lengthening of thy life one Miserere while, would not heare them, but euen as now find thee, so wil present thee before the tribunall seate of God, wherefore dispatch away.
Ah God, whose mieserie is comparable to mine? Youth (quoth Death) no words will preuaile, thy sobs and sighes, thy lamentable outcries and pittifull complaints, thy wringing of hands, and tearing of thine haire doe not moue me a whit, but forth with will bring thee to a place where thou shalt feele proue such things, as neither thine eyes haue seene, nor thy haue hard, nor thy hart can co~ceiue or imagine: thou haddest time enough to haue seene this hower, haddest thou bin wise, but had wist commeth now too late.
Ah cruelll death, must go, alas, whither thou leade me? to a land vnknowne, a la~d of vtter darknes,
where shall liue depriued of all my worldly pleasures, neither shall any man liuing see me againe?
But to what ende doe stand intreating of him that is past all pity? Better were it for me to spend the litle space that yet remaineth, in bewayling my time, which haue most vnprofitably spent.
that had now a sea of brackish tears to runne downe my cheekes, for after this hower my teares will neuer be meritorious any more.
Ah God how haue lost, how haue neglected, how haue mispent my golden time, in vaine and wanton speeches, in banqueting and chambering, in dauncing and dallying, in dicing and carding, in bibbing and bousing,
in sleeping compasse, and a thousand other such villaines, in which seeing my solace haue vtterly lost my selfe, and hunting after transitorie pleasures, haue found eternall torments and paines.
Alas why did not while might, endeuour so to liue as might not haue feared to die, (for sure am, that he that liueth well can not chuse but die well:) why had not all my life long made preperation for this iournie, in which so many millions of men perish, as scarce one among ten thousand passe to the end in safety: Oh, oh most vnhappie I, alas, alas, in what danger do stand, if my footing faile me now, perish perpetually: Ah miserable wretch that am, all this as yet is but the preface or prologue to the
play, all that as yet feele is but a shadow or dum shew of that which presently must follow, and if the prologue be so dolefull, alas how terrible will the Tragedie it selfe be? If the very shadow and feare of death be so horrible as it wholly amazeth me to thinke thereupon, oh God what will death it selfe be? In what sort shall appeare and stand before the face of that most iust and seuere iudge, whom and in whose sight haue offended more then a hundred thousand thousand times, and that most hainously? was sent into this world to serue my Lord God, my creatour and redeemer, in fasting, praying and the like, but alas haue consumed my time in doing the quite contrarie.
turning fasting into feasting, praying into prating, vertues into vices and all misdeedes whatsoeuer, of all the dayes of my life God onely knoweth whether haue spe~t either one day or hower in his seruice to his liking or not.
Alas with what shame and confusion shall stand before God and his Angels, when shall be driueu to giue an account of euery idle word that haue spoken in my dayes, what a reckening am like to make? Alas am not able to number the thousandth part of the mortall crimes that haue committed, what then can say for my idle words and thoughts, which in number surmounte the sandes of the Sea?
should haue thought of these things before, but now alas it is too late, wo, wo to me tenne thousand times, that euer deferred my time of amendment, putting off from day to day, crying with the Crow, Cras, Cras, so long as now am like to bee the Diuels owne blacke bird, and to be put vp in the Cage of hell for euermore.
false fawning and flattering friends, cousening and craftie Physitions, how iust cause haue to wish, that had neuer knowne nor seene you? you told me all was well, and that there was no daunger of death at all: Feare nothing said you, this infirmity is nothing but a litle distemperature of some humors, and therefore thou needest not send for the
Preacher, or to trouble your selfe with thinking on your sinnes at this time, but when you are well, confesse your sinnes vnto God at leasure, at this time sleepe, take your rest and set all your cares apart you shall soone be whole this maladie.
false and vnfaithfull friends: friends I? nay rather most cruell enemies of my poore soule, and workers of my euerlasting and miserie, for hearkening to your Syren songs, haue rushed on the rockes of euerlasting death, perish there is none to helpe: but las, am well enough serued for he that will not death, is worthie to be preueted by him.
All mortall wights of wh sexe or degree soeuer thou
remember that thou must die, and perhaps as soone as my selfe, for anie warrant that thou hast to the contrarie; do good to all while thou mayest, seeke to appease the wrath of God: while you haue time, in Hymnes, Psalmes and Thanksgiuing seeke to praise, and please him, and while thou liuest in this wretched world, liue in such sort as in the houre of death you die not in such confusion and as do now.
wish now that had spent my youth in the wildernesse with Iohn Baptist, liued by rie bread and water with prayed with mes, vntill my knees had as hard as horne, bewayled my sins with Mary Magdane, whose co~tinual teares had et to furrowes or gutters in
her face, beaten my selfe wi an yron chaine thrise a vntill the bloud ranne to the ground, as Kather of did, and done thing else whatsouer, and might liue any longer, wou liue euen like an Angell vp earth, but alas would when might, and now not though would.
Let eu rie one therefore if he be wi beware by my harmes, a while yeares, strength, a time do serue to merite, deuour to preuent the miserable cares and most perillo perplexities that you see lapped in.
Behold, stand no in such extremitie, as ma greater account, and wou more reioyce of one Pater ster, or other litle prayer said for me, then
haue with the prodigall child, spent my golden time, and wasted all lasciuiously, not thinking what would follow, and now go a begging from dore to dore, crauing some spirituall mes, and euerie one thrueth me from him, saying: Ne forte nobis, tibi non fufficiat.
would gladly catch some of the crummes that fall from their table, but no ma~ will giue anie, no man hath pitie of e; and rightly, for why should any man pitie him that would not pitie himselfe? cared not for my selfe, why then should others care for me?
all you that stand here about me, and are of my present miseries, beware, ware by me, and while you
are in health, hoord not your treasurers in earth, but heauen, let poore mens somes be your Redeeme your sinnes and your quities with pitie of the endeuor by the means of ked Ma~mo~ to make you frie~ds, that in the houre of they may bring you richly den with merites and workes into the eternall nacle, and be not excluded shut out for want of without hope of mercie fauour, as ye see me.
Oh, oh, cruell death hath pierced my hart, the of my dissolution is come, liue no longer, my xeth dimme, my senses my tong beginneth to cl to the roofe of my mouth,
voyce waxeth feeble, and in of speaking, begin to in the throate.
Alas, alas, must be gone, must die, must die, farewell my faithfull friends, all the things that in this world tooke delight in; must now depart and leaue you all behind.
Adue, Adue for euer and euer, shall neuer see you againe.
Behold, my legs waxe cold as yce, my hands withered and drie, my nayles blacke, my face wanne, pale, earthly, my sight dimme and mine eyes waxe hollow begin to roll in my head, and more and more waxe lothsome to looke on, my heart panteth and gaspeth for breath,
it can indure no longer, all my carnall friends begin put me in mind of God, will me to call vpon Iesus, to runne to him for mercie.
las, how can with now cal vpon him whom uer serued? how can hope mercie at his hands, whom haue so infinitly offended? ring life abused his mercy, a therefore must now feele iustice.
Arsenius, Arnius, how happie and wert thou, that haddest houre of death alwayes thine eyes.
But wo, and thousand times wo to me, th neuer thought on vntill was wounded at heart.
ghost go now? what harbour all my sinfull soule find? ho will receiue her? who all be her companion? who al be her guide in this strange gion by the which she is to who will or can helpe r? or what is he that dareth speake for her, departing as doth? lord God of thou art our guide, thou the way by which should walke, thou art the doore by which must enter; be thou refuge, my comfort, and in this most dreadfull oure: thou art the Father of mercie, and God of all and comfort, it is more proper to thee to haue mercie en for me to sinne; cannot so much, but thou canst much more: and this
also beleeue, that more offend thy dispairing of thy mercie, in all the other sinnes that
committed, and there will put my trust in thee though thou shouldest kill
Miserere mei Deus, mise met, quta in te confidit mea.
Into thy hands, do commend my soule, haredeemed me, Lord of truth.
Ah farewell, farewell friends, God graunt my and vnprouided may make you to liue and better then haue done, manie legions of wicked rits which enuiron me ro about, triumphing the petition of my soule, hoping haue me their perpetuall hel.
All good Christians pray or me, that God of his infinite goodnesse deliuer me not ouer to the willes of those most horrible and vgly monsters.
HIerusalem my happie home, When shall come to thee? When shall my sorowes haue an end? Thy ioyes when shall see? happie harbour of the Saints, sweet and pleasant soile: In thee no sorrow may be found, No griefe, no care, no toile.
In thee no sicknesse may be seene, No hurt, no no sore: There is no death, not vgly diuell, Theres life for euermore.
No dampish mist is seene in thee, No cold, nor darkesome night: There euerie soule shines like the Sun, There God himselfe giues light.
There lust and luker cannot dwel, There enuie beares no sway: There is no hunger, hear, nor cold, But pleasure euerie way.
Ther's Nectar and Ambrosia made, Ther's muske and Ciuet sweet: There many a fine and daintie drugge Are troden vnder feete.
There Cinamon, there Sugar growes, There Nard and Balme abound: What toung can tell, or heart conceiue The ioyes that there are found? Quite through the streets with siluer sound The floud of life doth flow, Vpon whose bankes on euery side The wood of life doth grow.
There trees do euermore beare fruite And euermore do spring: There euermore the Angels sit, And euermore do sing.
There Dauid stands with harpe inhand, As maister of the quire: Ten thousand times that man were blest That might his mufike heare.
Gods praises there are alwayes song, With harmonie most sweete: Old and Zacharie Haue not their songs to seeke.
There Magdalene hath left her mone, And cheerefully doth sing With blessed Saints, whose harmonie In euery streete doth ring.
Hierusalem my happie home, Would God were in thee, Would God my woes were at an end, Thy ioyes that may see.
Of the punishmentes which the Lord threatneth vnto such as liue a sinfull life.
ONe of the principal means which the Lord hath vsed often times to bridle the hearts of men, and to draw them vnto the obedience of his commandements, hath bene to set before their eyes the horrible plagues and punishments, that are prepared for such persons as be rebels, and transgressors of his lawe: for although the hope of the rewardes that are promised to the good in the life to come, may moue vs very much hereunto, yet are we co~mo~ly more moued with things
that be irkesome vnto vs, than with things that be pleasant: euen as we see by dayly experience, that we are vexed more with an iniurie done vnto vs, than delighted with any honor: and we are more troubled with sicknesse, than comforted with health: and so by the discommoditie of sickenesse we come to vnderstand the commoditie of health: as by a thing so much the better perceiued, by how much more it is sensibly felt.
Nowe for this cause did the Lorde in times past vse this, meanes more then any other, as it appeareth most clearely by the writings of the Prophets, which are euery where full of dreadfull saying and threatnings,
wherwith the Lord pretended to put a terror into the hearts of men, and so to bridle
subdue them vnder the obedience of his law: and for this end he commaunded the Prophet leremie,
that hee should take a white booke, and write in the same all the threatnings and calamities which he had reuealed vnto him, euen from the first day he began to talke with him, vntill that present houre: and that hee should reade the same in the presence of all the people, to see if peraduenture they would be mooued therewith to repentance to cha~ge their former life, to the end that he might also change the determination of his wrath, which he had purposed to execute vpon them: and the holy Scripture sayth, That when the Prophet had done according as he was commaunded by Almightie God, and had read all those
threatnings in the presence of the people, and of the Rulers, there arose such a feare and terror amo~g them, that they were all astonished, and as it were bestraught of their wits, looking one in anothers face, for the exceeding great feare which they had conceiued of those wordes.
This was one of the principal meanes that Almighty God vsed with men in the time of the law written, and so did hee also in the time of the lawe of grace; in which the holy Apostle sayth,
that as there is reuealed a iustice whereby God maketh men iust, so is there also reuealed an indignation and wrath, wherwith he punisheth the vniust.
For which cause Saint Iohn Baptist, the glorious forerunner of our Sauiour
Christ, was sent with this commission embassage, to preach vnto the worlde,
that the axe was now put to the roote of the tree, and that euery tree that brought not foorth good fruite should be cut downe, and cast into the fire.
He sayd moreouer, that there was another come into the world more mightie then he, that caried in his hande a fanne, to winnow clense therwith his flower, and that hee would put vp his corne into his garnard, but the chaffe he would burne in a fire that should neuer be quenched.
This was the preaching and embassage, which the holy of our Sauiour Christ brought into the worlde, and so great was the thunder of these wordes, and the terrour which entred into mens hearts so dreadfull, that
there ran vnto him of all state and conditions of men, euen the very Pharisees and Publicans, yea and souldiers also (which of all others are to be most dissolute, to least care of their conscience and each of them for demaunded particularly of the holy man, what he should to attaine vnto saluation, to escape those terrible which he had denounce vnto them: so great was feare they had conceiued them.
Now this is that (my dear Christian brother) which at this present in the behalfe Almightie God preach thee, although not with feruencie of spirit, and like lines of life, yet (that which in porteth more to this case) wit
the same truth, and certaintie: for so much as the faith and Gospel that Saint Iohn Baptist preached at that time, was no other, but this which we preach at this present.
Now if thou be desirous to vnderstand in few words, how great the punishment is, that Almightie God hath threatned in his holy Scriptures to the wicked, that which may most briefely and most to the purpose be saide in this matter, is this: that like as the rewarde of the good is an vniuersall good thing, euen so the punishment of the wicked is an vniuersall euill, which comprehendeth in it all the euils that are.
For the better vnderstanding whereof it is to be noted, that all the euils of this life are particular euils, and therefore doe not torment
all our senses generally, but onely one or some of them.
As taking an example of the diseases of our bodie,
wee see that one hath a disease in his eies, another in his eares, one is sicke in his heart, another in his stomacke, some other in his head, and so diuerse men are diseased in diuerse parts: howbeit in such wise, that none of all these diseases bee generally throughout all the members of the bodie, but particular to some one of them.
And yet for all this we see what griefe onely one of these diseases may put vs vnto, and howe painefull a night the sicke man hath in any one of these infirmities, yea although it be nothing else but a litle ache in one tooth.
Now let vs put the case, that there were some one man sicke of such an
vniuersall disease, that hee had no part of his bodie, neither any one ioynt or sense free from his proper griefe and torment, but that at one time and instant he suffered most exceeding sharpe paines in his head, in his eyes and eares, in his teeth and stomake, in his liuer and heart, and to be short, in all the rest of the members and ioynts of his bodie, and that hee lay after this sort stretching himselfe in his bed, pained with these griefes and torments, euery member of his bodie hauing his particular torment, he say, that shold lie thus pained, and afflicted, how great torment and griefe of minde, thinke ye, should he sustaine? what thing could any man imagine more miserable, and more worthy of compassion? Surely if thou sholdest
this is that (my deere Christi brother, if any comparison be made between them) which is suffered in that cursed place of hell, not onely the space of one night, but uerlastingly, for euer and
For like as the wicked haue fended Almightie God with their members and senses, a haue made armour of them to serue sinne: euen so will ordaine that they shall there all tormented each one of the with his proper torment:
the shall the wanton and eyes be torme~ted with the rible sight of diuels:
the ear with the confusion of such rible cries, and lamentations shall there be heard:
with the intollerable stench of that filthy and lothsome place: the taste,
and all the members of the bodie, with extreame colde and fire: the imagination,
shall bee tormented by conceiuing of griefes present: the memorie,
by considering what benefites are left, and what miseries are to come.
This multitude of punishmentes the holy Scripture signifieth vnto vs, when it faith, that in hell there shall be hunger, thirst, weering, wailing, gnashing of teeth: swordes double edged, spirits created for reuengement, serpents, worms, scorpions, hammers, and wormewood, water of gall, the spirit of tempest, and other things of like sort.
are signified vnto vs, as in a figure, the multitude and dreadfull terror of the most horrible paines and torments, that be in that cursed place, there shall be like wise darkenesse, both inward and outward, both of bodie and soule: farre more obscure then the darkenesse of Egypt,
There shall be fire also, not as this fire here that tormenteth a litle, shortly endeth, but such a fire as that place requireth, which tormenteth exceedingly, and shall neuer make an end of torme~ting.
Now if this be true, what greater wonder can there be, than that they which beleeue and confesse this for trueth, should liue with such a strange negligence and carelesnesse as they doe? What trauailes and paines
would not a man willingly take to escape euen one onely day, yea one houre, the very least of all these torments? And wherefore do they not then to escape the euerlastingnesse of so great paines, horrible torme~ts, endure so litle a trauell, as to followe the exercise of vertue? Surely the consideration of this matter were able to make a man besides himselfe, in case he would deepely weigh it.
there were any maner of hope of ende or release, it would be some kinde of comfort: but alas it is not so, for there the gates are fast shut vp from all expectation of anie maner of ease, or hope: in all kind of paines, and calamities that be in this world, there is alwayes some gappe lying open,
whereby the patient may ceiue some kinde of comfo sometimes reason, sometime the weather, sometimes friendes, sometimes the hea that others are troubled the very same disease, sometimes at the least the hope of end, may cheere him Onely in these most horri paines and miseries that bee hell, all the wayes are shut vp such sort, and all the hauen comfort so embarred, that miserable sinner cannot he for remedie on any side, neith of heauen, nor of earth, neith of the time past, or present, of the time to come, neither by any other meanes.
The daned soules thinke that all are shooting darts at them, that all creatures haue conred against them, and that themselues are cruell anst themselues.
To this may applied that saying of the ly Prophet Dauid: The sowes of bill haue compassed round about, and the snares haue besieged mee.
For which side so euer they or turne their eyes, they continually behold of sorrowe and griefe, none at all of any ease, or
The wise Virgines sayeth the Euangelist) that readie prepared at the of the bridegroome entred and the gate was foorthwith locked.
locking euerlasting! inclosure immortall! gate of all goodnesse, which shal any more be opened again, if he had said more plainely, gate of pardon, and mercie, of comfort, of intercession, of
hope, of grace, and of all go nesse is shut vp for euer uer. Sixe dayes no more Manna to be gathered, but seuenth day,
which was the both day, there was none to found, and therefore shall fast for euer, that hath not due time made his prouision forehand.
The sluggard (sa the wise man) will not till ground for feare of colde, therefore shall hee begge bread in sommer, and no shall giue him to eate, an an other place he faith: He gathereth in sommer is a sonne, and hee that giueth selfe to sleeping at that season the sonne of confusion.
For confusion can there be great then that which that couetous riche man suffer who with a fewe crumme
bread that fell from his table, haue purchased to himfe abundance of euerlasting and glorie in the of heauen: but because would not giue so small he came to such an exeame necessitie, that he begd, yea and shall for euer gge, but onely the droppe colde water, and shall neuer taine it: who is not mooued ith that request of this infornate damned person, who ryed: father Abraham, haue mpassion vpon me, send vnto mee, that hee may ppe the tippe of his finger in ater, and touch my tongue, for horrible flames doe me exceedingly.
What request could there be desi then this? hee durst not so much as one cuppe of
water, either that Laza should put this whole handing the water, not yet (which more to be at) did request so much as finger, but onely the tiped that it might touch his to and yet this onely would be graunted vnto him, wh by thou maiest perceiue, fast the of all consolation shut vp, and howe that interdict and excommu cation is, which is there laid on the damned, fith this glutton could not obtaine much as this small request that where soeuer the damn persons do turn their eies, which side soeuer they sire forth their hands, they shall finde any maner of comfort, so small, and as he th is in the sea choked, and almo
drowned vnder the water, not any stay wherewith to ttle his foot, stretcheth forth is handes often times on euee side in vaine, (because all he graspeth after is thinne and liquid water, which deceiueth him) euen so shall it re with the damned persons, en they shall be drowned in deepe sea of so many where they shall striue and struggle alwayes with death, without finding any succour or place of stay, whereupon they may rest themselues.
Now this is one of the greatest paines wherewith they be tormented in that cursed place.
For if these torme~ts should haue their continuance limited but for a certaine time, though it were for a thousand, yea, a hundred thousand millions of yeres, yet euen
this would bee some litle comfort vnto them, for nothing perfectly great in case it an end, but alas, they haue so much as this poore and miserable comfort, but contra wise, their paines are equall continuance with the eterni of Almightie God,
and the sting of their miserie, with eternitie of Gods glory: as as Almightie God shall liue, long shall they die: and Almightie God shall cease bee God, then shall they all cease to be as they are.
life! immortall death! know not whether may truely tearme thee either life, death: for if thou be life, wh doest thou kill? and if thou be death, how doest thou endure wherefore will call thee neyther the one, nor the other:
so much as in both of them there is contained some that is good, as in life there is rest, and in death there is an end (which a great comfort to the afflicted:) but thou hast neither rest nor end: what art thou the~? Marie, thou art the worst of life, and the worst of death, for of death thou hast the torment without end, and of life thou the continuance without any rest.
Almightie God hath both life and death of that good which they had, and hath put in thee, that which to be a punishment or the wicked.
of the which all the sinners of the shall drinke their part.
Now in this continuance, in his eternity, would wish that
thou (my deare Christian brother) wouldest fixe the eyes thy consideration a litle while that as the cleane beast cheweth her cud, euen so wouldest chew and weigh point within thy self with greater deliberation: and to the intent thou maist do it the better, consider a litle the that a sicke man abideth in night, especially if he vexed with anie vcheme~t grie or sharpe disease: marke often he tumbleth and in his bed, what hehath, how long and tedio one night seemeth vnto how duly he counteth all th houres of the clocke, and ho long he thinketh each of the to be, how he passeth the in wishing for the dawning the day, which
ding is like to helpe him verie litle towards the curing of his disease.
If this then be accounted so great a torment, what a torment shall that be (trow ye) in that euerlasting night in hell, which hath no morning, nor so much as anie hope of dawning of the day? darknesse most obscure! night euerlasting! night accursed euen by the mouth of Almightie God, and of all his Saints: that one shall wish for light, and shall neuer see, neither shall the brightnesse of the morning arise more; consider then, what a kind of torment that be, to liue in such a night as this is, not in a soft bed, (as sicke man doth) but in a te burning furnace foming
out such terrible raging flames what shoulders shall bee able to abide these horrible heates? Oh how it maketh euen to tremble quake, only to thinke of it! If it seeme to vs thing intollerable, to haue only some part of our feet standing vpon a panne of burning coales for the space of saying one Pater noster, what shall be (trowe ye) to stand body and soule, burning in the dest of those euerlasting fiers in hell, in comparison whereof the fiers of world are but painted fires! there any wit or iudgement this world? haue men th right senses? do they what these words import? or are they perswaded, that these onely fables of Poets? or
they thinke that this appertaineth vnto them, or else that it was meant onely for others? none of all this can they say, for so much as our faith assureth vs certainely herein: and our Sauiour Christ himselfe, who is the euerlasting truth, cryeth out in his Gospell,
saying: Heauen and earth shall faile, but my word shall neuer faile.
Of this miserie there followeth an other, as great as it,
which is, that the paynes are alwayes continuing in one like being, and in one same degree, without anie manner of intermission, or decreasing.
All maner of things that are vnder the cope of heauen, do moue and turne round about with the same heauen, and do neuer stand still at one state
The sea and the riuers haue their ebbing and flowing, the times, the ages, and the mutable fortune of men of kingdomes, are euermore in continuall motion, there is no seue so feruent, that doth not decline; neither griefe so sharpe but that after it is much augmented, it doth forthwith decrease.
To be short, all the tribulations and miseries are by litle and litle worne away with time: and as the common saying is, nothing is sooner drie vp then teares, only that pain in hell is alwayes greene: only that feuer neuer decreaseth onely that extremitie of knoweth not what is either euening or morning.
God rained fortie dayes and fortie nights continually without ceasing vpon the earth; and this sufficed to drowne the whole world, but in that place of torment in hell there shall raine euerlasting speares, and darts of furie vpon that cursed land, without euer ceasing so much as one onely moment; and this is so true, that as (faith a euen the paines which shall be there giuen for the smallest sinnes, shall be likewise euerlasting, aswell as those paines which be there prescribed for the greatest and most hainous sins, for infinite punishment is due vnto all sinnes, because in the estate of damnanation there is no absolution or discharge of anie debt,
(for that the time of paying and satisfying is then past) therfore shall the paine due vnto veniall sinne continue euermore in one same estate, and shall neuer cease.
Now what torment can be greater and more to be abhorred, then to suffer after one like maner without any kind of alteration or change, though meate be neuer so delicate yet in case we feed continually thereupon, it will in verie short time be verie lothsome vnto vs: for no meate can be more precious and delicate, then that Manna was, which almightie God sent to the children of Israell in the desert, and yet because they did eate continually thereof, it made them to lothe it, yea, and prouoked them to vomite it vp againe.
The way that is al plaine (they say) wearieth more then anie other, because alwayes the varietie (yea euen in punishments) is a kind of comfort.
Tell me then of good fellowship, if things that be pleasant and sauorie, when they be alwayes after one maner, are an occasion of lothsomnesse and paine, what kind of lothsomnesse will that be, which shall be caused by those most horrible paines, torments in hell, which do continue euerlastingly after one like sort: what will the damned and cursed creatures thinke, when they shall there see themselues so vtterly abhorred, and forsaken of Almighty God, that he will not so much as with the remission of one small sin, mitigate somewhat their torment? so
great shall the furie and rage be which they shal there conceiue against him, that they shall neuer cease continually to curse and blaspheme his holy name.
Vnto all these paines there is also added the paine of that euerlasting consumer,
which is the worme of conscience, whereof the holy Scripture makes oftentimes mention, saying: Their worme shall neuer die: and their fire shall neuer be quenched.
This worme is a furious raging despight, a bitter repentance without any fruit, which the wicked shall haue alwayes in hell, by calling to their remembrance the oportunitie and time they had whiles they were in this world to escape: these most grieuous and horrible torments, how they would not vse the benefit
therof, therfore whe~ the naiserable sinner seeth himself thus tormented and vexed on euery side, and calleth to mind how manie dayes and years he hath spent idlely in vanities, in pastime, and pleasures, and how oftentimes he was aduertised of this perill, and how litle regard he toke thereof.
What shall he thinke? what anguish sorrow shall there be in his he art? hast thou not read in the Gospell,
that there shall be weeping, and wayling and gnashing of teeth.
Now these others the like shall be the causes of this so great excessiue griefe.
For the better vndersta~ding hereof, being a matter of so great importa~ce, will giue thee a like exa~ple, let vs cal to mind the history of Ioseph that great famin that cotinued
before which famine (as the holy Scripture faith) the abundance of corne in the other seuen yeares before was so great, that it might be compared with the sands of the sea and exceeded all measure, but after that these seuen yeares were ended, there followed other seuen yeares of so great barrennesse and dearth, that euen in the first yeare of the~ all, the people of Egypt came before king Pharao, crying out and saying: Giue vs somewhat to eate.
The king sent them to Ioseph, who required of them all the mony they had, gaue them for the same corne sufficient for that yeare: when that was consumed and spent, they returned the yeare following vnto Ioseph, saying, Giue vs
to eate: what, wilt thou suffer vs to die for hunger in thy preseuce, because wee haue no more money to giue thee? to whom he aunswered: deliuer vnto me al your heards of cattell, and for the same will giue you corne in exchange, since you haue no more money left.
After that they had deliuered vnto him all their cattell, and that their prouision was also spent, they came againe to him the next yeare, saying; now thou knowest my Lord that we haue no money, nor cattell to giue thee, and there remaineth nothing else but onely our bodies and lands, how canst thou suffer vs to die here for hunger in thy sight, our persons, and lands, which are only left of all our substance are thine, buy vs as slaues for the
king, giue vs (if it be thy pleasure) corn to sow the la~d that lie not vntilled, desolate, they are al dead that shold til inhabit it.
By this meane came Ioseph to buy al the land in Egypt, for euery one sould his possessio~s by reason of the great famine which they suffred: is the history.
Now let vs take that out of it that serueth to out purpose, tell me then beseech thee, what a griefe was it vnto these miserable me~ when reme~bred the~selues of those plentifull yeres past, saw we with how little money they might haue prouided corne afore ha~d, yea, and haue layd also wherby to inrich the~selue during their liues, how iustly might they lament the~selues, saying, how tunate are we might so
haue prouided for this dearth, and would not, if we had not admonished of this before then perhaps our might haue had some excuse, but being thereof so long time before, seeing with al, what speed the kings purueyours made to gather together lay vp all the corne they could get, the which was sufficie~t to giue vs to vndersta~d what we ought to haue done in that behalfe, yet for all this to be so slothfull, careles as we were, what ca~ we haue? how much worth wold that be to vs at this present which the~ we despised, conte~ned! what riches might now get with the same which we did the~ cast away? But (my good all this is but as a shadow
dow compared with the truth That famine in Egypt endure only for seuen yeares, but in hel shal indure euerlastingly that found a remedy, though with great difficulty charge but for this, there shall neuer remedy be fou~d; that might be redeemed with money cattell, but this can neuer be redeemed with any maner of exchange, this punishment cannot be pardoned, this paine canot be exchanged, this cannot be reuoked: to conclude, those men of Egypt after that the seuen yeares began to lift vp their heads, and to come out of their miserie, but in hell once entreth to be punished shall neuer know againe what rest and ease meaneth.
this were during that time so much afflicted and vexed, in how much worse case shall he be that shall see himselfe in hell fire so horribly tormented, and vexed, and that without all hope of remedie? if thou knewest, and wouldest consider how euery one of them shall there stand tormenting, renting himselfe, weeping, and wayling, and saying, miserable and vnfortunate wretch that am, what times, what oportunities haue suffered to passe in vaine; a time there was, when with one sup of cold water might haue purchased vnto my selfe a Crowne of glory, wherefore did not looke before me? how was blinded with things present? how did let passe those fruitfull yeares of such abundance, and did not
enrich my selfe? yea if bene brought vp among in sidels and pagans, and had be lecued that there had bene nothing else, but only to be and die, then might haue some kind of excuse, and might haue said that knew not was forbidden me, but for much as haue liued Christians, and was my one of them, and held in for article of my beleefe, that hower should come, when should giue vpon account what order had spent life: for so much also as it daily cried out vnto me, by continuall preaching and of religious perso~s aduertisements many following made preparation in labored earnestly for the puisio~ of their souls health,
life also and example was a greater proofe of that which they spake: for so much say as made light of these examples, and preachings, perswaded my selfe very fondly, that heauen was prepared for me, though tooke no paines for at al, what deserue that haue thus led my life? ye infernall suries come and rent me in beeces, and deuour these my bowels, for so haue iustly deserued: haue deserued to be hunger starued for euer, seeing would not prouide for my selfe, while had time: deserue not to reape, because haue not sowne, am to bee destitute fith haue not layd vp in store.
deserue that now my reuest should bee dinied me, th when the poore made request
vnto me, refused to lease them: haue deserued sigh and lament in vaine, long as God shall bee God; haue deserued that this wor of co~scie~ce shold gnaw my for euer euer, by vnto me the little which haue enioyed, the great felicity which lost, and how farre greater th was which might haue gain by forgoing that little which would not forgo.
This is the immortall worme that shal uer die, but shall lie there gnawing at the trailes of the wicked, which one of the most tirrible that can possiblie bee
Thou wilt peraduenture a mazed (good Christian in reading so many
of paines in hell, as hath bene described, and now thou perswaded that there can be added vnto this no more then hath bene sayd, but surely the mighty of God wanteth not force to chastice his enmies more and more, for all the paines that we haue hitherto chearsed, as such as do generallie to all the damned, but besides these generall paines there be other particular paines, which each one of the damned shall there suffer in sort, according to the qualitie of his sinne, and so according to this proportion,
the and proude shal there be a based and brought low to their confusion, the couetous shall bee driuen to miserable necessity,
the lecherous shall in the very same flames which they themselues haue and those that haue al the life time liued dissolutely hunted after their pleasu and pastimes, shall liue in continuall lamentation sorrow.
Now then if all this shall suredly come to passe, what is he that seeing all this so certainely with the eyes of faith, will not turne ouer lease, and begin to prouide himself against that time: is the iudgement of men not become? where be their with where is at the least their sel loue, which seeketh for his owne profit, is much afraid of any losse, what? may it be thought that men are be come beastes, that prouide on
for the time present negct time to come? or haue ey peraduenture so dimmed eir that they cannot looke before them? (sayth Esay) yea deaffe, yee blind, open your eies, at you may see: who is blind but my seruant? and who is but ye to whom haue my messengers? and who blind but hee that suffereth mselfe to be sould for a slaue? hou that seest so many wilt thou not see this? ou that hast thine eares open, ilt thou not giue eare if thou beleeue nor how art thou a Chriian? and if thou beleeue it, dost not prouide for it, canst thou bee thought man? faith, that this is the
difference betweene an opi+nion and imagination, that imagination alone is not suf+cient to cause a feare, but an is: for if do imagi that a house may fall vpon it is not enough to make me vnlesse beleeue or ha an opinion that it will be so +deed: for then it is sufficient make me afraid: and here commeth the feare that alwayes haue, by of the suspition they concei that their enemies doe lie waite for them.
If then the and onely suspition daunger, is able to cause most valiant and couragious feare, how is it that the and beliefe of so and so great terrible miseries which is farre more sure then any opinion or knowledge, do
make thee to feare, if thou perceiuest that for this many yeres past thou hast led a licentious and sinfull life, and that at the last according to present iustice thou art condemned to these terrible torments of hell: may also probablie that there is no other likelihood of of thy life to come the~ thou hast shewed hitherto after so many yeares past: how hapneth it, that running headlong forwards into so manifest a danger, thou art nothing at all afraid, especially considering the sinfull state wherein thou and the horrible and torments, which do attend for thee, and the time that thou hast lost, and the endlesse repentance which thou shalt haue therefore in the most horrible torments of hell? assuredly
it passeth all common sence, to consider that there should bee such wilfull grosse blindnesse in men.
TO the ende there might want nothing to stirre vp our minds vnto vertue, after the paines which almightie God threatneth vnto the wicked, he doth also set before vs the reward of the good, which is, that glorie, and that euerlasting life, which the blessed Saints doe enioy in the kingdome of heauen: whereby he doth very mightily allure vs to the loue of the same, but what manner of thing this reward,
what this life is, there is no tongue, neither of Angels nor yet of men, that is sufficient to expresse it, howbeit that may haue some kind of sauour and knowledge thereof, intend to rehearse here euerie word, what Saint Augustine say th in one of his medetations, speaking of this life.
life (sayth hee) prepared by almighty God for his friends, a blessed life, a secure life, a quiet life, a bewtifull life, a cleane life, a chast life, a holy life, a life that knoweth no death, a life without sadnesse, without labour, without griefe, without trouble, without corruption, without feare, without varietie, without alteration, a life replenished with all bewtie and dignitie, where there is neither enemie
that can offend, nor delight that can annoy, where loue is perfect, and no feare all: where the day is euerlasting, and the spirit of al is one where almighty God is seene face to face, who is the onely meate whereupon they without any lothsomnesse: delighteth me to consider thy brightnesse, and thy treasure do delight my longing heart the more consider thee, the more am striken in loue with thee: the great desire haue thee, doth wonderfully me, no lesse pleasure is it to me to keepe thee in remembrance.
life most happy! kingdome truely blessed wherein there is no death, end, neither yet succession time, where the day continuing
euermore without night, knoweth not any mutation: where the victorious conquerour being ioyned with the euerlasting companies of Angels, and hauing his head Crowned with a garland of glorie, singing vnto almighty God one of the songs of Sio~: happie, yea and most happie should my soule bee, if when the race of this my pilgrimage is ended, might be worthy to see thy glory, thy blessednesse, thy beauty, the walles and gates of thy Citty, thy streetes, thy lodgings, and thy noble Citizens, and thine omnipotent king in his most glorious Maiestie: the stones of thy walles are precious, thy gates are adorned with bright pearles, thy streetes are of very fine excellent gold, in which
there neuer faile perpetuall praises, thy houses are paued with rich stones, wrought throughout with Saphires, and couered aboue with massie gold: where none entreth in that is not cleane, neither doth doth any abide there that is defiled: faire and bewtifull in thy delights art thou Ierusalem: none of those things are suffered in thee, that are suffered here: there is great diuersitie betweene thy things, and the things we doe continually see in this miserable life: in thee is neuer seene neither darkenesse nor night, neither yet any change of time, the light that shineth in thee commeth neither of la~pes, nor of the moone, nor yet of the bright glistring starres, but God that proceedeth of God, and the light that
commeth of light is he that giueth clearnesse vnto thee, euen the very king of kings himselfe keepeth continual residence in the midst of thee, compassed about with his officers, and seruants: there do Angels in their order sing a most sweete, and melodious harmonie, there is celebrated a perpetuall solemnity and feast, with euery one of them that commeth thither after his departure out of this pilgrima ge, there be the orders of Prophets, there is the famous company of the Apostles, there is the inuincible army of martyrs,
there are the true and perfect religious persons, there are the holy virgins which haue ouercome both the pleasure of the world, and the frailtie of their owne nature, there are the young men, and yong women
more auncient in vertue then in yeares: there are the sheepe, and little lambes, that haue escaped from the wolfe, and from the deceiptfull snares of this life, and there doe now keepe a perpetuall feast each one in his place all alike in ioy, though differe~t in degree; there charity raigneth in her full perfection, for vnto them God is all in all, whom they behold without ende, in whose loue they will be al co~tinually enflamed, whom they alwayes loue and in louing doe praise, and in praysing doe loue, and all their exercises consist in praises, without wearinesse, and without trauell.
happie were yea and very happie indeede, if what time shall be loosed out of the prison of this wretched bodie, might bee
thought worthy to heare those songs of that heauenly melody, song in the praise of the euer lasting king by all the Citizens of that so noble city: happie were I, and very happie, if might obtaine a roome among the chaplaines of that chappell, and waite for my turne to sing praises to my God: if might be neere to my King, my God, my Lord, and see him in his glory, euen as he promised me, when he sayd: father this is my last determinate wil, that all those that thou hast giuen vnto me, may be with me, and see the glory which had with thee before the world was created: hitherto are the words of Saint Augustine.
Now tell me (good Christian reader) what a day shall that be, that shall shine in thy
house (if thou leade thy life in the feare of God) when after the course of this pilgrimage, thou shalt passe from death immortalitie, in that passage when others shall beginne to feare, thou shalt beginne to reioyce, and lift vp thy head, because the day of thy deliuerance is at hand.
Come foorth a little (sayth Saint Ierome) out of the prison of this body, and when thou art before the gate of the Tabernacle, set before thine eies the reward thou hopest for: tel me, what a day that be, when the Lord himselfe with all his Saints, shall come and meete thee in the way, saying vnto thee, Arise, make hast, my beloued, my delight, and my for now the winter is past, and the tempestuous waters are ceased,
How great ioy shall thy soule then receiue, when it shall be at that time presented before the throne of the most blessed Trinity, by the hands of the holy Angels? how clearely shalt thou vnderstand the value and excellency of vertue; there the obedient man shall talke of victories, there vertue shall receiue herreward, and the good shall be honored according to their desert: moreouer, what a pleasure will it be vnto thee, when thou shalt see thy selfe to be in that sure hauen, when thou shalt remember the tempestes wherein thou hast beene tossed, the straights through which thou hastpassed, and the daungers
which thou hast passed, and the daungers of theeues, and pirates, from who~ thou hast escaped this is the place, where they shall sing the song of the Prophet, which sayth, Had it not bene that the Lord had bene my helper, it could not bee but that my soule had gone to hell.
And how it hath pleased almightie God, that among such a multitude of damned persons, thou shouldest be of the number of his elect, and one of those to whom hee would graunt such exceeding great felicitie, and glorie.
Besides all this, what a goodly sight shall it be to behold the feastes, and triumphes, which they daily celebrate with their new brethren, who hauing conquered the world, and finished
the course of their pilgrimage, do enter in there to be crowned with them.
what a ioy will it be to see those seates filled vp, and that Citie builded, and the walles of that noble Ierusalem repaired again: with what cheerefull imbracings shall the whole Court of heauen intertaine them, beholding them when they come loden with the spoiles of the vanquished enemie? There shall those valiant men and women enter with triumph, which haue together with the world, conquered the weakenesse of their owne frayle nature: there shall the innocent virgins enter, which haue suffered martyrdome for Christs sake, with double triumph ouer the flesh, and the worlde,
adorned also with garlands lillies, and roses vpon their heads: there shall also dayly manie young men and children, which haue vanquished the tendernesse of their yong yeares with discretion vertue, and shall receiue their rewarde: how sweete and sauerie shall the fruit vertue then be, although for time before, her rootes seeme verie bitter: sweet is the euening after the hote sunny day: sweet is the fountaine to the wearie traueller: sweet rest and sleepe to the tired seruant: but much more sweet it to the Saints in heauen to enioy peace after warre, security after perils, eternall rest after their paines and trauels, for are the wars at an end, the~ need they no more to go all armed
The children of Israell went forth armed towards the land of promise,
but after that the land was conquered, they laid downe their speares, castaway their armour, forgetting al feare and turmoyle of warre: each one vnder the shadow of his pauilion and harbour, enioyed the fruit of their sweet peace.
Now may the eyes sleep there, that haue bene wearied with continuall watching,
now may the watching Prophet come downe from his standing that did watch and fixe his feet vpon the place of the centinell.
There is no more feare of inuasion by the terrible armies of the bloudy enemie, there is no place for the suttle crasts of the lurking viper, there cannot arriue the deadly sight of the
venimous Basiliske, neither yet shall the hissing of the serpent be heard there, but only the soft breathing aire of the holy Ghost, wherein is beholden the glorie of Almighty God: this is the region of pleasure place of securitie, situated aboue all the elements, whither the cloudes and stormie windes of the aire cannot come.
glorious things haue been spoken of thee, Citie of God Blessed are they (saith holy Tobias) that loue thee, and enioy thy peace.
my soule praise the Lord, for he hath deliuered Ierusalem his Citie from all her tribulations.
Happie shall be, if the remnant my posteritie might come to see the clearenesse of Ierusalem.
with Saphires and Emeralds, and all the circuit of her walles shall be built with precious stones: her streets shall be with white and polished and in all parts of her territorie shall be song praises.
Ioyful cou~try, ôsweet glory! blessed company! who shall be so fortunate and so happy as those that are elected for thee? It seemeth a presumptio~ to desire thee, and yet will not liue without the desire of thee: ye sonnes of Adam, race of men miserably blinded and deceiued! ye scattered sheep wandering out of the right way, if this be your sheepecote, whither go ye backward? what meane you? why suffer you such an excellent benefite to be wilfully lost, for not taking so litle paine? If labour
trauell be requisite hereu furely from henceforth sire that all the labor paine of the world were layd me: let all sorrowes po downe vpon me as thicke haile, let diseases vexe me, tribulations afflict me, let persecute me, let another quiet me, let all creatures the world conspire against let me be made a laughing stocke to all men, and a ref to the world: yea, and let life be wholly consumed wi griefes my yeares with weping, and lamentation, so th after this life, may rest selfe in the day of tribulation and be thought meete to a place among the blessed people, which are adorned beautified with such inestimable glorie in the kingdome
Now then, thou foolish louer of this miserable world, go thy way, seeke as long as thou wilt for honors and promotions, build sumptuous houses and pallaces, purchase lands possessions, enlarge thy territories and dominions, yea, command, if thou wilt, whole empires and worlds, yet shalt neuer be so great as the of all the seruants of Almighty God: who shal receiue that treasure which this world cannot giue, and shall enioy that felicitie which shall endure for euermore; thou with thy pompe and riches shalt keepe companie with the rich Glutton, buried in the deepe pit of hell: but the deuout spirituall man shall be caried vp by the holy Angels with
Of the benefits which the promiseth to giue in this to such as liue ust gly life.
PEradue~ture thou wilt say, that all these things rehearsed, be rewards, punishments that are onely for the life to come, that thou desirest to see in this present life, because our minds are wont be much moued with the sig of things present.
Well, to tisfie thee herein, we will like wise giue thee here thy full, euen of that thou earnestly desire: for
the Lord do reserue the best wine, and the most delicate dishes vntill the end of the banket, yet he suffereth not his friends to be vtterly of meate and drinke in this tedious voyage: for he knoweth verie well that they could not otherwise hold out in their iourney: and therefore when he said vnto Abraham: Feare not Abraham, for am thy defender, and thy reward shall be exceeding great.
By these words he promised two things: the one for the time present, that was, to be his sauegard and defence in all such things as might happen in this life: and the other for the time to come: and that is the reward of glorie, which is reserued for the next life.
the first promise is, and many kinds of benefits, and fauours, are therein included, man is able to vnderstand, only he that hath with gre diligence read the holy wherein no one more often rehearsed and forth, then the greatnesse the fauours, benefites, and which Almighty God promiseth to his friends in life.
Hearken what Salom faith in his Trouerbes as this matter: Blessed that man that findeth wisdom for it is better to haue it, th all the treasures of siluer gold, be they neuer so and excellent, and it is worth then all the riches of world, and whatsoeuer heart is able to desire, is not comparable vnto it.
of dayes are at her right hand, riches, glorie at her left.
She is the of life to al those that haue tained her: and he that shall haue her in continuall possessio~ be blessed.
Keepe therere, my sonne, the lawes of mightie God, and his counls, for they shall be as life to soule, and sweetnesse to taste, then shalt thou walke fely in thy wayes, thy feet not find any stumbling if thou sleepe, thou haue no cause to feare, take thy rest, thy sleepe be quiet.
Now this is (good Christian the sweetnesse and of the way of the Godly, but the wayes of the are farre different, as
the holie Scriptures do vnto vs: the paths and of the wicked (faith Eistieus are full of bramb and at the end of their iou are prepared for the~, hell, nesie and paine.
Doest thinke it then a good exth to forsake the wayes of mightie God, for the of the world, sith there great difference betweene one and the ether, not in the end of the way, but in all the steppes of the what madnesse can be gter, then to chuse rather one torment to gaine anot thee~ with one rest to gaine ther rest? And that thou more clearely perceiue the cellencie of this lest, and wh a number of benefits are incident thereunto
beseech thee hearken attentiuely, what euen Almightic God himselfe hath promised by his Prophet Esay, to the obseruers of his Law, in a maner in these wordes, as diuerse interpreters do expound them: when thou shalt do (faith he) such such things, which haue commanded thee to do, then shal forthwith appeare vnto thee, the dawning of the cleare day (that is the Sunne of iustice) which shal driue away all thine errors and miseries, then shalt thou beginne to enioy true and perfect saluation, and all thy former sinnes shall be blotted out of Gods remembraunce, and the glorie of the Lord shall compasse thee round about: then shalt thou call vppon the name of the Lord, and he will surely heare thee, thou
shalt call, and he will say, behold am here present and readie to graunt thee thou shalt haue neede of: the in the midst of the darknes, tribulations and vexations of th life, the light of Gods fauour shal shine vpo~ thee, which comfort thee, and thy darkne shall be as the noone day, (for the Lord wil so ordain, that the very calamities, withall, the very falls of thy sinnes past shall be an occasion vnto thee of thy greater felicitie) he giue thee alwayes true peace and quietnesse in thy soule, and in the time of famine dearth he will sende thee plentie and aboundance: and thy boner shal be deliuered from death, and from the euerlasting fires and thou shalt be like a garden of pleasure, and like a fountaine
of water that neuer ceaseth running: of thee will hee make a building, (which laye for many yeares before desolate) in such sort that it shall stande stedfastly, and endure with sure foundations from generation to generations.
And if thou shalt take pains in sanctifying my Saboths, not in spending them in leude exercises, nor yet in fulfilling thy owne will against mine, but shalt obserue withal diligence and care all such things as haue commaunded thee this day, then shalt thou take delight in the Lord (whose delights excell all the delights in the world) and will lift thee vp aboue the heights of the earth, that is, vnto a most happie state of life, whereunto all the treasures of fortune or of humaine nature
Finally, will giue thee afterwardes plentie and abundance of that precious inheritance, which haue promised vnto Iacob thy father which is the felicitie of glorie: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
All these in a manner, bee the wordes of Almightie God by the Prophet Esay.
Nowe these are the benefites, which Almightie God hath promised to his seruaunts: and albeit some of them be for the time to come, yet are some of them to bee presently receiued in this life, as that newe light and shining from heauen, that sacietie and aboundance of all good things: and assured confidence trust in Almightie God: that deuine assistance in all our prayers and petition:
made vnto him: that peace and tranquillitie of conscience, that protection and prouide~ce of Almightie God, that garden of delights (which is the verdure and beautie of grace) that fountaine which neuer wanteth water, (which is the prouision sufficiencie of things.)
Thus heauenly delights do excel all the delights of the world, and that eleuation of spirite, whereunto no strength or power of nature is able to aspire.
All these are the gracious gifts and fauours which Almightie God hath promised to his seruaunt in this life.
They all are his workes of his mercie, effectes of his grace, testimonies of his loue, and blessings which hee of his fatherly prouidence sheweth towardes
them, vppon euery one of which there is so much to be sayd, that the breuity of this volume will not suffer me to treate particularly of euery point: but to be short, all these benefits doe the godly enioy, both in this present life, and in the life to come, of all these are the vngodly depriued, both in the one life, and in the other.
Whereby thou maist easily perceiue, what difference there is betweene the one son and the other, seeing the one is so rich, and the other so poore, and needy: for if thou ponder well all these words before declared, and do likewise consider the state and conditious both of the good and the wicked, thou shalt find, that the one sort are in the fauour of Almighty God, and the other in his displeasure;
and the other his enemies; the one be in light, and the other be in darknesse; the one do enioy the company of Angels, the other the filthy pleasures and delights of finne; the one are truely free, and Lords ouer themselues, and the other are become vnto Sathan, and vnto their lustes and appetites; the one are ioyfull with the witnesse of a good conscience, and the other (except they bee vtterly blinded) are continually bitten with the worme of conscience euermore gnawing one them; the one in tribulations stand stedfastly in their proper place, and the other like light chaffe are carried vp downe with euery blast of wind; the one stand secure firme with the anker of
hope, and the other are vnstable, and euermore yeelding vnto the assaults of fortune: the prayers of the one are acceptable and liking vnto God, and the prayers of the other are abhorred and accursed: the death of the one is quiet, peaceable, precious in the sight of God, the death of the other is vnquiet, painefull, and troubled with a thousand frights and terrours.
To conclude, the one liue like childre~ vnder the protection and defence of Almightie God, and sleepe sweetly vnder the shadow of his pastorall prouidence, and the other being excluded from this kinde of prouidence, wander abroade like straied sheep without their shepeheard and maister, lying wide open to all the perils, dangers and assaults of the world.
Now then (my deare brother) if a vertuous life be accompanied with all these benefites, tell me pray thee of good fellowship, what is the cause shall withdraw thee, and perswade thee not to embrace such a precious treasure? what art thou able to alleage for excuse of thy great negligence? to say, that this is not true, it can not bee admitted, for so much as thou seest, that all is grounded vppon the word of God, and the testimonies of his holie Scriptures: and to say,
that these are but small benefites, thou canst not, for so much as they doe exceede (as we haue before declared) all that mans heart can desire.
To say, that thou art an enemie vnto thy selfe, and that thou dooest not defire these benefites,
this cannot be sayd, considering that man is euen naturally a friend to himselfe, and the will of man hath euer an eye to his owne benefit, which is the very obiect, or marke that his desire shooteth at: to say that thou hast no vnderstanding or tast of these benefits, it will not serue to discharge thine offence, for so much as thou hast the faith and beliefe, though thou hast not the tast, for the tast is lost through sin, but not the faith;
and the faith is a witnesse more certaine, more secure and better to bee trusted, then all other experiences, and witnesses in the world: why dost thou not then discredit all other witnesses, with this one assured testimony? why dost thou not rather giue credit vnto faith, than to thine owne
opinion and iudgement? that thou wouldest make a resolute determination to submit thy selfe into the hands of Almighty God, and to put thy whole trust assuredly in him: how soone shouldest thou see all these prophecies fulfilled in thee? then shouldest thou see the excellency of these deuine treasures, then shouldest thou see how starke blind the louers of this world are, that seeke not after this high treasure.
To be short, then shouldest thou see vpon what good ground our Sauiour inuiteth vs to this kind of life: saying: Come vnto me all ye that trauell, and are loden, and will refresh you: take my yoke vpon you, and you shall finde rest for your soules; for my is sweete, and my
Almightie God is no deceiuer, not false promiser, neither yet is hee a great boaster of such things as he promiseth, why doest thou then shrinke backe! why doest thou refuse peace and quietnesse? why doest thou despise the gentle offers and sweete callings of thy pastors? how darest thou despise and banish away vertue from thee, which hath such prerogatiues and priuiledges as these be, and withall confirmed and signed euen with the hand of Almightie God.
The Queene of Saba heard far lesse things thee~ these of Salomon,
yet she trauelled fro~ the vttermost partes of the earth to trie the truth of those things wh she had heard, why doest not thou then hauing such notable,
yea and so certaine newes of vertue, aduenture to take a little paines to trie the truth and sequele thereof? my deere Christian brother, put thy trust in Almighty God, and in his word, and commit thy selfe boldly without all feare into his armes, and vnlace from thy handes triflings knots, that haue hitherto deceiued thee, and thou shalt finde that the deedes of vertue, doe farre excell her fame, and that all which is spoken in praise of her is nothing, in comparison of that which she is in deed.
That a man ought not to deferre his repentance and conuersion vnto God from day to day, considering that hee hath so many debts to discharge, by reason of the offences committed in his sinfull life past.
NOw then if on the one side there be so many so great respects that do bind vs to change our sinfull life, and on the other side, wee haue not any sufficient excuse why we should not make this exchange, beseech thee tell me, how long time wilt thou tarrie vntill thou fullie resolue to do it; turne thine eyes (ô my Christian brother) and
looke backe a little vppon thy life past, and consider that at this present of what age soeuer thou be, it is high time, or rather the time is well neere past to begin to discharge some part of thine old debts; consider that thou who art a Christian, regenerated in the holy water of Baptisme, who doest acknowledge Almighty God for thy father, consider say, that all this notwithstanding thou hast liued euen as loosely, and dissolutely, as thou hadst bene a meere infidell, that had neuer any knowledge of Almighty God: and if thou deny this, then tell me what kind of sinne is there that thou hast not committed, what tree is there forbidden, that thou hast not beholden with thine eyes? what greene meddow is there
in which thou hast not (at the least with desire) feasted thy lecherous lustes? what thing hath bene set before thine eyes, that thou hast not wantonly desired? what appetite hast thou left vnexecuted, notwithstanding that thou didst beleeue in Almighty God, and that thou wert a Christian? what wouldest thou haue done more, if thou haddest not had any faith at all, if thou haddest not looked for any other life, if thou haddest not feared the dreadfull day of iudgement? What hath all thy former life bene, but a webbe of sinnes, a sinke of vices, a way full of brambles and thornes, and a frowarde disobedience of Almighty God, with whom thou hast hitherto liued, but onely with thine appetite,
with thy flesh, with thy pride, and with thy goodes, and riches of this transitory world? these haue beene thy gods, these haue bene thine Idols, whom thou hast serued, whose lawes thou hast diligently obeyed: make thine accounts with Almighty God, with his lawes, with his odedience, and peraduenture thou shalt find that thou hast esteemed him no more then if hee had bene a God of straw, for it is certaine, that there be many Christians, which beleeuing that there is a God, are induced to sinne with such facility, as though they did beleeue that there were no God at al: do offend no whit lesse, though they beleeue that there is a God, then they would doe
What greater what greater despite there bee done, then thus to contemne his deuine maiesty.
Finally, thou beleeuing all such things, hast notwithstanding so led thy life, as if thou we perswaded that the beliefe the Christians were the gre rest fables or lies in the world.
And if the multitude of thy sinnes past, and the facility thou hast vsed in committing of them, do not make thee afraid, why dost thou not feare at the least the Maiesty omnipotency of him, against whom thouhast sinned? Life vp thine eyes, and consider the infinite greatnesse and omnipotency of the Lord, whom the powers of heauen doe adore,
before whose Maiestie the whole compasse of the wide world lyeth prostrate, in whose presence all things created are no more then chasse, carried away with the wind: consider also with thy selfe, how vnseemely it is, that such a vile worme as thou art, should haue audacitie so many times to offend prouoke the wrath of so great a Maiestie.
and what horrible punishments hee hath vsed from time to time in the world, against sinne, and that not onely against particular persons but also vppon Cities, Nations, Kingdomes, and Prouinces: yea vpon the vniuersall world, and not only in earth, but also
in heauen, not only vpon s+gers and sinners, but euen his owne most innoceson, our sweete Sauiour Ies
Christ, when he tooke him to satisfie for the de that they owed.
And if seuerity was vsed innocent greene wood, for the sinnes of others, then will he do vpon drie withered wood, and those that are loden with owne sinnes? Now what can be thought more vnreasonable, then that such a wretched weake dwarfe a thou,
shouldest be so sawcie and mallaparte, as to mocke with so mighty a Lord, whose hand is so heauie, that in case hee should stricke, but euen one stroke vppon thee, hee would at
one blow driue thee downe into the deepe and bottomlesse pitte of hell; to be tormented for euer by the diuels and his Angles, without all hope of remedie.
Consider likewise the great patience of this our mercifull Lord,
who hath expected thy repentaunce so long, euen from the time that thou didst first offend him, and thinke that if after so great patience, and long tarrying for thee, thou shalt still continue thy lewde and sinfull life, abusing thus his mercie, and not ceassing to prouoke him to further indignation and wrath, he will then bend his bow, and shake his sworde, and raine downe
of we reade and see dayly great wonders: we see ho king Salomon himselfe, after be so great wisedome, and those three thousand parable and most profound vttered by him in his book called Cantica was sorsaken of almighty God and fuffered to fall downe,
a adore Idols: wee see many starres fall downe from heauen to the earth, with serable falles,
and to themselues in the durt, and to cate the meate of swine, which sate before at Gods table, and were fed with the very of Angels.
pride, or negligence, or else for some ingratitude of theirs, be thus iustly forsaken of almighty God, after they haue bestowed so many yeares in his seruice, what mayst thou looke for, that hast done nothing else all thy life time, but onely heaped vp sinnes vpon sinnes, and hast thereby offended Almighty God, most grieuously.
Now if thou hast liued after sort, were it not reason that thou shouldest now at the giue ouer, and cease sinne vpon sinne, and debt vpon debt, and begin to pacifie the wrath of almighty god, and disburthen thy sinfull soule: were it meete that that time which thou hast hitherto giuen to the world, to the flesh, and to the diuell, should suffice, and that thou shouldest bestow
some litle time of that which remaineth to serue him, hath giuen vnto thee all thou hast? were it not a po of wisedome after so long time and so many great iniuries, feare the most terrible of Almighty God, who more patiently hee sinners, the more doth hee terward punish them greater seuerity and were it not meete for thee feare thy long continuance many yeares in sinne, and in displeasure of almighty God procuring thereby against the such amighty aduersary as is, and prouoke him of a mercifull louing father, to be a seuere terrible judge and nemy? were it not meete to feare, least that the force custome may in continuance
of come be turned into nature, and that thy long vicious vsuall maner of committing of sinne, may make of a vice a necessitie, or litle lesse? why art thou not afrayd lest by litle thou maist cast thy felse downe headlong into the deep pit of a reprobate sence,
wherinto after that a man is once falle, he neuer maketh account of any sinne, be it neuer so great.
The Patriarke Iacob sayd vnto Laban his father in law: These fourteene yeares haue serued thee, looked to thine affaires, now it is time, that should looke to mine owne, begin to attend vnto the affaires of mine owne houshold.
Wherfore if thou hast likewise bestowed so many yeares, in the seruice of this world, and
of this frayle transitorie were it not good reason, thou shouldest now to make some prouision the saluation of thy soule, son the euerlasting life come? There is nothing short, nor more then the life of a and therefore prouiding carefully as thou doest for such things as bee necess for this life, which is so sha why doest thou not likew prouide somewhat for that is to come, which for euer and euer? The conclusion of all the premises.
IF now all this bee so, beseech thee (ô my
Christian brother) euen for the bitter passion of Iesus Christ, to remember thy selfe, and to consider that thou art a Christian, and that thou beleeuest assuredly for a most vndoubted truth what thy faith instructeth: this faith telleth thee, thou hast a iudge aboue, that seeth all the steps and motions of thy life; and that certainly there shall a day come, when hee will require an account of thee, euen of euery idle word: this faith teacheth thee, that a man is not altogether at an end when hee dieth, but that after this temporall life there remaineth another euerlasting life, and that the soules dye not with the bodie, but that while the bodie remaineth in the graue, vntill the generall day of iudgement,
the soule shall enter into another new countrey, and into a new world, where it shall haue such habitation, and companie as the faith which it had in this life.
This faith telleth thee also, that both the reward of vertue, and the punishment of vice, is a thing so wonderfull, that although the world were full of bookes, and all creatures were writers, yet should they all be wearied, and the world come to an end, before they should end their description, and make a perfect declaration, what is comprehended in each one of these points.
This faith informeth thee also, that the debts, and duties, which we owe vnto Almightie God, are so great, that albeit a man had so many liues, as there be sands in the sea, yet would they not suffice,
And this faith like wise telleth thee, that vertue is such an excellent treasure, that all the treasures of the world, and all that mans hart can desire,
Wherefore if there be so many and great respectes that do inuite vs vnto vertue, how commeth it to passe, that there be so few louers and followers of the same? If men be moued with gaine and commoditie, what greater commoditie can there be, then life euerlasting? if with feare of punishment, what punishment can be greater, then euerlasting horrible tormentes in hell fire, world without end? if with bondes of debtes, and benefites, what debtes are greater then thee, which we owe vnto
Almightie God, aswell for that hee is which hee is, as also for that which we haue receiued of him? If the feare of perils doe moue vs, what greater perill can there bee then death, the houre thereof being so vncertaine, and the account so strait? If thou bee moued with peace, libertie, quietnesse of minde, and with a pleasant life (which are things that all the world desireth) it is certaine, that all these are founde much better in the life that is gouerned by vertue and reason, then in that life, that is tuled by the affections and passions of the minde, for so much as man is a reasonable creature, and no beast.
Howbeit in case thou accountest all this as not sufficient to
moue thee thereunto, yet shall it not suffice thee to consider, that Almightie God so abased him selfe for thy sake, that he descended from heauen vnto the earth, and became man? and whereas hee created the world in fix daies, he bestowed thirtie and three yeares about thy redemption, yea was also content for the same to loose his life: Almightie God dyed, that sinne should dye, yet for all this we doe endeuour that finnes might liue in our harts.
Notwithstading that Almightie God purposed to take away the life of sinne with his owne death, What shall say more? assuredly of reasons we haue shewed enough, and enough, if this matter were be to discussed by reason: for say this, not onely in beholding.
Almightie God him self, but wheresoeuer we turne our eyes, we shall finde that euery thing crieth out vnto vs, and calleth vpon vs to receiue this so excellent a benefite, for there is not a thing created in the world, (if we doe well consider it) but doth inuite to the loue and seruice of our Lord and Sauiour: in so much that looke how many creatures there be in the world, so many preachers there are, so many books, so many voyces, and so many reasons, which doe all call vs vnto Almightie God.
And how is it possible then, that so many callings as these are, so many promises, and threatnings, should not suffice to bring vs vnto him? What might Almightie
God haue done more then he hath done, or promised more then hee hath promifed, or threatned more then hee hath threatned, to draw vs vnto him, and plucke vs from sinne, and yet all this notwithstanding, how commeth it to passe, that there is so great (I will not say arrogancie, but) be witching of men, that doe beleeue those things to be certainly true, and yet bee not afrayd to continue all the dayes of their life in sinne? yea to go to bed in sinne, and to rise vp againe in sinne, and to embrew them selues in euery kinde of sinne: and this is done in such sorte, so without feeling, so without feare, so without scruple of minde, and without
breaking of one houres sleepe as if al that they belieued dreames, and old wiues tales, and as if all that the holy euangelistes haue written, were meere vntruthes, starke lies.
Tell me now thou desperare traitor, tell me say thou firebrand prepared to burne in those euerlasting and reuenging horrible fires of hell, what wouldst thou haue done more then thou hast done, in case thou haddest bene perswaded that all were meere lyes, which thou hast belieued: for although see well, that for feare of externall punishment imposed by the Princes law, thou hast somewhat bridled thine appetites, yet can not perceiue that for any feare of Almighty God thou
hast thy will in any one thing: neither from carnall pleasures, nor from takinge reuenge of thine enemies, nor from backbiting and slaundering thy neighbours, nor yet from fulfilling thine inordinate and filthie lustes and desires, in case thine ability serued ther unto, tell me thou blind grosse buzzard, and worse then franticke fellow, what sayth thy worme of conscience vnto thee, whiles thou art in such a fond security, and confidence, continuing in such a carelesse and dissolue wicked life as thou doest, where is now become the vnderstanding, iudgement, and reason, which thou hast of a man? why art thou not afraid of so horrible, so certaine,
and so assured perils and dangers: if there were a dish of meate set before thee, and some man (albeit he were a lier) should say vnto thee that there were poyson in that dish, tell me, darest thou once aduenture to stretch foorth thy hand to take a tast thereof, though the meate were neuer so sauery and delicate, and hee neuer so great a lier that shold beare thee thus in hand? If the Prophets, if the Apostles, if the Euangelistes, yea if Almighty God himselfe doe one vnto thee, and say.
Take heede miserable man for deal is in that kind of meate, and death lyeth lurking in that glintenous morsell, which the diuell hath set before thee, how darest thou reach for euer sting death with thy owne
hands, drinke thine one damnatio~: to what vse puttest thou in this meane while thy wits, thy iudgements, and thy discourse,
and reason, which thou hast of a man, where is their light, where is their force, sith that none of them: doe bridle thee any whit from thy common vse of vices? thou wretched and madde carelesse bewitched by the dinell, adiudged to euerlasting darhenesse, both in ward and outward, and so goest on from one darkenesse to the other thou are blind to see thy misery, insensible thy perdition, and harder then any adamant to the of Gods word.
times most miserable thou art, worthier to bee with none other
then with those where with thy da~nation was lamented: whe~ it was said: that thou knewest this day the peace, quietnesse, and treasures, which Almighty God offereth vnto thee, and do now lie hidden from thine eyes: miseraable is the day of thy natiuity, much more miserable the day of thy death, for so much as that shall be the beginning of thy euerlasting damnation:
how much better had it bene for thee neuer to haue bin borne,
if thou shall be damned in the most horvible of he fire for euer euer? How much better had it bene for thee neuer to haue beene baptized, if throughthe abusing thereof by thy wicked life, thy damnation shal be therby the greater: for if the light of reason onely sufficeth to make
the heathen Philosophers inexcusable, because they knowing God in some degree, did not glorifie him, nor serue him (as the Apostle sayth) how much lesse shall he be excused, that hath receiued the light of faith, and the water of Baptisme, and doth often receiue the representation of the Lords body, and euery day heareth his word preached,
if he doe nothing more then these pagan Philosophers haue done?
Now what other thing may we inferre of the premises, but briefely to conclude, that there is none other vnderstanding, none other wisedome, none other counsell in the worlde, but that setting aside al the impedime~ts combersome dangerous
wayes of this life, we solow only that true and certaine way, whereby true peace and euerlasting life is obtained? hereunto we are called by reason, by wisedome, by lawe, by heauen, by earth, by hell, and by the life, death, iustice, and mercie of Almightie God.
Hereunto we are also inuited very notably by the holy Ghost,
speaking by the mouth of Ecclesiasticus in this wise: My sonne bearken to instruction, euen from the first yeares of thy youth, and in thy latter daies thou shalt enjoy the sweete fruite of wisedome: approch vnto it as one that ploweth and soweth, and with patience expect the fruitfull encrease which it shall yeeld vnto thee.
The paines that thou shall take, shall be but little, and the benefits that thou shalt quickly
May sonne hearken to my words, and neglect not my counsell which shall giue, put thy feet willinglyinto her fetters, and thy necke into her chaines, bowe downe thy shoulders and carry her vpon thee, and be not displeased with her bonds, approch neere vnto her with all thy heart, and follow her wayes with all thy strength, seeke for her with all diligence, and shee will discouer her selfe vnto thee, and after that thou hast found her neuer forsake her, for by her shalt thou findrest in thy latter daies; and that which before seemed painefull, will afterwardes become pleasant vnto thee, and her fetters shalbe a defence of thy strength, and foundation of vertue, and her chaine shall be arobe of glorie, for in her is the
very beauty of life, her both are the very bonds of health Hitherto are the words of wherby thou maist in some degree vndersta~d, how great the beauty, the delight, the liberty, and riches of true wisedome are, which is vertue it felse, and the knowledge of Almighty God, whereof we do intreate.
But is al this be not sufficient to mollifie thy heart, lift vp thine eyes, fixe thy mind not vppon the water of the world, which vanish away, but vppon the Lord who died for our sins: there stan deth he with his feet nailed fast, looking for thee, with his armes spread abroad to receiue thee, and with his head bowing downe to giue thee, as to another prodigal son, new kisses of peace, attonement: from thence he calleth
thee (if thou couldest here him) with many callings and cries, hearken therefore (ô my Christian brother) and consider this well with thy selfe, that if his prayer bee not heard, that hearkneth not vnto the cries of the poore, how much lesse shall he bee heard that maketh him self deaffe to such cries as these are.
Wherfore now determine with thy selfe to hearken vnto these cries, be fully resolued to change thy sinfull life, to liue a new life, and so shalt thou at the last possesse the ioyes which neuer shall end.

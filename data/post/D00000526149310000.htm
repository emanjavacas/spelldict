his highness prince rupert's letter to the earl of arlington his majesties principal secretary of state from on board the sovereign now under sail june
about seven leagues off lastoff at nine in the morning the wind in my last gave an account that the enemy lay in the schonevelt and that we were at an ankor seven leagues from east capel which bore from us now have to tell you of a second engagement with them which happened upon june the fourth
the enemy having had the oportunity by lying so near their own coast to refit and furnish themselves with all things they wanted and knowing very well that as the wind has stood of late we could not do the like were encouraged to come out upon us as they did that day afternoon having the advantage of a strong gale at which we quickly perceived and got under sayl standing having our larboard tacks on board and as close haled upon the wind as we could lye stood to receive them
about four in the afternoon van

trump with the amsterdam squadron bore down and began to engage with the blew according to their usual custom begining to fire at a great distance about five de ruyter with his squadron engaged with me and the zealand squadron with the white at his first coming de ruyter made a show as if he would have come very near me but before he was within musket shot he sprung his luff and closed his wind as much as possibly he could going off on a suddain for good and all which made us suppose he had either some extraordinary damage in his ship or that himself was hurtÂ· their whole fleet continued pelting at us at a great distance till dark night we keeping our ground not withstanding their fireships
about midnight part of the dutch fleet tacked standing towards the southerly and quickly after the rest did the like as we guessed by an impefect sight we had of them and at some distance
at two in the morning we tack'd also and stood after them at six seeing no likelihood of reaching them before they would get within their sands we thought it to no purpose to pursue them any farther so we tack'd again and stood for our own coast
all we can say more of the enemy is that they went off in great disorder leaving us ignorant of what loss they have sustained
on our side we lost never a ship and very few men of our commanders captain white of the warspit and captain sadlington of the crown were killed of the captain henshaw and lieutenant fitzgerald were killed and lieutenant ufton was wounded

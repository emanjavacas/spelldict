Portingall, Spayne, England, France, Poland, Denmarke, Hungaria, Slauonia, and all Greece, are cut from the Empire, vvith the Countries there abouts, and the Iles of Sicilia, Sardinia, Corsica, and Sauoy.

The old and auncient seate of the Empire, the Popes possesse, and a great deale more; beeing now so farre from acknowledging an Emperour, that they haue made the Emperour and Gouernours beholding to them.
The Venetians holde not onely freedoms, but Prouinces, and are the freest people of the vvorld, as it were seperated fro~ the Romaine Empire.

Thys Romaine Monarchie, is and shall bee the last, vvhich although it hath greatly decayed, yet shall part thereof continue to the vvorlds end, wherein shal remaine the name and maiestie of an Emperour.
These foure Monarchies were prophecied of long since by the Prophet Daniell, vnder the figure of a great Image, vvhose head was made of golde, breast of siluer, belly of copper, legges of yron, and feete of earth, and yron, mistically described.

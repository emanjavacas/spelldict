sir

when first according to my open and free manner of communication to my intellectuall friendes shewed you a copie of my idea which acquainted you with my scope and generall projection upon gesture you were pleased as in a platonique extasie of apprehension

to admire the vastnesse of the designe to applaud the rise thereof and the promising aspect it had to the advancement of learning insomuch as fill'd with the benevolent influence and illustration of a prophetique rapture you turn'd chiromancer divining by the lines of life and prosperity which appeared faire unto you in the first draught that the hand would be embraced and kissed by the more intelligent part of the world and in time travell and learne to speake as it doth naturally so literally all languages
this strong reflection of your conceits on

my early undertakings you have by the vivacity of a mastering phansie oftentimes endeavoured to propagate in the opinions of your most generous acquaintances which as they were the friendly efforts of a subtle perspicacity of your iudgement which have heard a great critique to acknowledge to be the genuine felicity of your intellect whereby you are able to dissect the least atome of a philosophicall projection have though the raising of expectation proves many times an injurious courtesie took as a good omen to advance upon
vvhat was

then a cloud that had neither the shape nor bignes of a mans hand is now growne fit to be held up and by its owne suffrage to chuse and confirme you its patron for affecting no dedication that rises above the levell of friendship having intentionally consecrated all the issues of my recesse and leisure to certaine select friends this both by prescription and signiority of acquaintance as by a prerogative and by a reciprocation of love for your affection to it falls to your tuition
confesse some other of my digested thoughts strugled for precedencie claiming by the

analogie of natures usuall course and the head would have had the priviledge of primogeniture but it fell out in the contention somewhat like as in the case of tamars twins where zarah put forth his hand and the midwife said this is come out first
however this chirosophie or first fruits of my hand be accepted abroad having put forth my right hand in signe of amity to you and for performance of promise there remaines nothing most noble chirophilus but that you take it between yours in token of warranty and protection as the tender of one who is

your affectionate friend john bulvver

to the candid and ingenious reader
this copy of my idea or the hint scope and generall projection

the consideration in generall and at large of humane nature that great light of learning hath adjudged worthy

to bee emancipate and made a knowledge of it selfe
in which continent of humanity hee hath noted as a maine deficiencie one province not to have beene

visited and that is gesture
aristotle saith he ingeniosè solertèr corporis fabricam dum quiescit tractavit eandem in motu nimirum gestus corporis omisit that is he hath very ingeniously and diligently handled the factures of the body but not the gestures of the body which are no lesse comprehensible by art and of great use and advantage as being no small part of civill prudence
for the lineaments of the body doe disclose the disposition and inclination of the minde in generall but the motions doe not only so but doe further disclose the present humour and state of the minde and will for as the

tongue speaketh to the eare so gesture speaketh to the eye and therefore a number of such persons whose eyes doe dwell upon the faces and fashions of men do well know the advantage of this observation as being most part of their ability neither can it bee denied but that it is a great discoverer of dissimulation and great direction in businesse
for after one manner almost we clappe our hands in joy wring them in sorrow advance them in prayer and admiration shake our head in disdaine wrinkle our forehead in dislike crispe our nose in anger blush in shame and so for the most part of the more subtile motions

taking therefore from hence my hint shal attempt to advance in the scrutinie and search after the scattered glances and touches of antiquity tracing them through most classicall authors with intent to reduce them into one continued and intire history propounding this form to my self to handle gesture as the only speech and generall language of humane nature
for ballast to the subject and to make the matter in hand more sollid and substantive shall annex consultations with nature affording a glosse of their causes and for the further embellishing thereof shall inrich most points of expression

with examples both of sacred and prophane authority more especially drawne from poets and historians the only great doctors in this point of humane literature wherein by the way shall lay claime to all metaphors proverbiall translations or usurpations and all kinde of symbolicall elegancies taken and borrowed from gestures of the body with the depredations the subtiler arts of speech have made upon them for the advancement and exaltation of their particular inventions and designes
all these together with the civill rites and ceremonious customes and fashions of divers nations in their

nationall expressions by gesture with the personall properties and genuine habits particular men being but as so many severall lines that meet in an angle and touch in this point intend to reduce and bring home to their fountaine and common parent the body of man
two amphitheaters there are in the body whereon most of these patheticall subtilties are exhibited by nature in way of discovery or impression proceeding either from the effect of sufferance or the voluntary motions of the minde which effect those impressions on the parts which wee call the speaking motions or discoursing

gestures and naturall language of the body to wit the hand and the head in answer whereof intend two receptacles of the observations falling within the compasse of their particular districts under the generall titles of chirologia and cephalelogia the naturall language of the hand and the naturall language of the head and these two comprise the best part of the expressions of humane nature
chironomia or the rule of the hand is adjoyned as the perfection and sublimation of chirologie as cephalenomia or the rule of the head is to appeare with

cephalelogia as being the qualification of all cephalicall expressions according to the lawes of civill prudence
the personall or genuine expressions fall in with these
what finde remarkable in the naturall expressions of the other parts shall refer to a generall rendevouze wherein shall take a muster of the postures and gestures of the body in generall
all that shall have to say more to the hand in point of gesture is under the title of chirethnicalogia or the nationall expression of the hand
this account my left hand
by this clavis suppose the intellectuall reader

will see that the work wil be supplementall to learning and not of supererogation new and in regard of the generality of the designe never attempted by any affording profitable hints to such ingenious spirits who desire to understand the mysterious properties of so admirable and important a piece of themselves

chirologia or the natvrall langvage of the hand

in all the declarative conceits of gesture whereby the body instructed by nature can emphatically vent and communicate a thought and in the propriety of its utterance expresse the silent agitations of the minde the hand that busie instrument is most talkative whose language is as easily perceived and understood as if man had another mouth or fountaine of discourse in his hand
so proper and apt to make signes and work great matters is the hand of man it seems to me observable that when moses covertly desired

a signe of god to make the aegyptians believe he had appeared unto him god presently asked him what he had in his hand and commands him naturall gestures which had thence the force of miraculous signification and to these signes god attributes a voice for he saith if they will not hearken to the voice of the first

signe they will believe the voice of the latter signe and as there is in the supernaturall so there is a signifying voyce in the naturall signes of the hand
althusius calls these miraculous

expressions of the hand habitus portentosos which by their rare and illustrious action denote and expresse some singular and memorable intention by the command of god besides their naturall signification
for the hand being the substitute and vicegerent of the tongue in a full and majestique way of expression presents the signifying faculties of the soule and the inward discourse of reason and as another tongue which we may justly call the spokesman of the body it speakes for all the members thereof denoting their suffrages and including their votes
so that whatsoever thought can be delivered or made significantly manifest by the united motions and connative endeavours of all the other members the same may be as evidently exhibited by the sole devoyre and discoursing gestures of the hand
the intendments of which demonstrative gestures being naturall signes have no dependance on any ordinance or statute of art which may be broken off or taken in hand as it is either repealed or stands in force but these being part of the unalterable lawes and institutes of nature are by their owne perpetuall constitution and by a native consequence significant
as smoke which in darke vapours expires from incensed fuell is a certaine signe of fire or as rich smells by whose aromatique breath the ayer's perfum'd doe sweetly declare the presence of the ascended odour and as the blushes of aurora bewray the early approach of the bright emperour

of the day so that in these art hath no hand since they proceed from the meere instinct of nature and all these motions and habits of the hand are purely naturall not positive nor in their senses remote from the true nature of the things that are implyed
the naturall resemblance and congruity of which expressions result from the habits of the minde by the effort of an impetuous affection wrought in the invaded hand which is made very plyant for such impressions
but whereas these speaking organs are couplets an active paire sometimes they both and not seldome one alone doth by a neat insinuation of speech make and accomplish the habit
sometimes differing words which visibly grow on one root of action goe for synonima's in gesture and we shall sometimes see contrarietie of patheticall expression in identity of posture

nor doth the hand in one speech or kinde of language serve to intimate and expresse our mind it speakes all languages and as an universall character of reason is generally understood and knowne by all nations among the formall differences of their tongue
and being the onely speech that is naturall to man it may well be called the tongue and generall language of humane nature which without teaching men in all regions of the habitable world doe at the first sight most easily understand
this is evident by that trade and commerce with those salvage nations who have long injoy'd the late discovered principalities of the west with whom although their language be strange and unknowne our merchants barter and exchange their wares

driving a rich and silent trade by signes whereby many a dumb bargaine without the crafty brocage of the tongue is advantageously made
hence tis apparent that there's no native law or absolute necessity that those thoughts which arise in our pregnant minde must by mediation of our tongue flow out in a vocall streame of words unto which purpose we must attend the leisure of that inclosed instrument of speech since whatsoever is perceptible unto sense and capable of a due and fitting difference hath a naturall competency to expresse the motives and affections of the minde in whose labours the hand which is a ready midwife takes oftentimes the thoughts from the forestalled tongue making a more quicke dispatch by gesture for when the fancy hath once wrought upon the hand our conceptions are display'd and utter'd in the very moment of a thought
for the gesture of the hand many times gives a hint of our intention and speakes out a good part of our meaning before our words which accompany or follow it can put themselves into a vocall posture to be understood
and as in the report of a piece the eye being the nimbler sense discernes the discharge before any intelligence by conduct of the vocall wave arrive at the eare although the flash and the report are twins born at the instant of the pieces going off so although speech and gesture are conceived together in the minde yet the hand first appearing in the delivery anticipates the tongue in so much as many times the tongue perceiving her self forestall'd spares it selfe a labour to prevent a needlesse tautologie and if words ensue upon the

gesture their addition serves but as a comment for the fuller explication of the manuall text of utterance and implyes nothing over and above but a generall devoyre of the minde to be perfectly understood
a notable argument we have of this discoursing facultie of the hand in our common jesters who without their voice speaking onely by gestures can counterfeit the manners fashions and significant actions of men
which may be more confirm'd by that wonder of cessity which nature worketh in men that are borne deafe and dumbe who can argue and dispute rhetorically by signes and with a kinde of mute and logistique eloquence overcome their amaz'd opponents wherein some are so ready excellent they seeme to want nothing to have their meanings perfectly understood
tis parallel to this what natures grand inquisitor reports of certaine nations that have no other language

wherein to impart their mindes the common tongue of beasts who by gestures declare their senses and dumb affections
for although seneca

will not allow their motions to be affections but certain characters impressions ad similitudinem passionum like unto passions in men which he calleth impetus the risings forces and impulsions of nature upon the view of such objects as are apt to strike any impressions upon it yet as montaigne in that elegant essay of his where he in

imitation of plutarch maintaines that beasts participate with us in the rationality of their discourses shewes that even they that have no voyce at all by their reciprocall kindnesse which we see in them we easily inferre there are some other meanes of entercommunication their

gestures treat and their motions discourse

non alia longè ratione atque ipsa videtur protrahere ad gestum pueros infantia linguae

no otherwise then for they cannot speake children are drawne by signes their mindes to breake

and why not saith he as well as our dumbe men dispute and tell histories by signes certainly as he well observeth there is a society and communion of justice fellowship good wil and affection betweene us and brutes they being not so remote from good nature gentlenesse and sweet converse but that they can expresse their desire of honour generositie industrious sagacity courage magnanimity and their love and feare neither are they void of subtilty and wisedome
for by reason of their affinity as it were and daily conversation with men they get a tincture from us of our manners and fashions and consequently enjoy a kinde of nurture and teaching discipline and apprentising by imitation which does enable them to understand and expresse themselves in this language of gesture teaching us by learning of us that capable they be not onely of the inward discourse of reason but of the outward gift of utterance by gesture and if there be some gestures of ours that they doe not understand so there are some of theirs which need an interpretor a greater critique in their language then democritus melampus or apollonius thyaneus were who understood all the idiomes of birds and beasts to expound them unto us
plato in setting out the golden age under saturne reckons among the chiefest advantages this kinde of communication
and indeed it is a kinde of knowledge that

adam partly lost with his innocency yet might be repaired in us by a diligent observation and marking of the outward effects of the inward and secret motions of beasts

this naturall language of the hand as it had the happinesse to escape the curse at the confusion of babel so it hath since been sanctified and made a holy language by the expressions of our saviours hands whose gestures have given a sacred allowance to the naturall significations of ours
and god speakes to us by the signes of his hand as bernard observes when he works wonders which are the proper signes of his hand
hic est digitus dei say the astonished magi when they acknowledged the expression of a divine hand
these signes in bernards language

are notae stelliferae blazing and starrie expressions
in another dialect of his divine hand he expresses his revealed will to his prophets by inspiration as ribera notes which the

prophets in scripture acknowledge to be the still voice of the hand of the lord
bede takes notice of another dialect or way of expression which god useth with his hand when he perswades men working upon them by the examples of good workes
after this manner christ our lord to his doctrine added the signes of his hand that is his workes according to that of the evangelist iesus began to doe and teach
and

as god speakes to us with his hand by a supernaturall way so we naturally speake to him as well as unto men by the appeale of our hands in admiration attestation and prayer
nay when we are beyond the vocall lines of communication with men and that distance of place hath

made the highest tone of our tongue too low to reach the auditory nerve of one that is remote or when the noise of some crowd hath rendred our tongue unserviceable to declare our minde we use the visible expressions of our hand as more loud and demonstrative which are afarre off perceived and understood by those who were uncapable of an auricular intimation
and as concerning those manuall expressions which we use to those are lesse distant from us the hand is so ready and cunning to expound our intentions abounding in a sense so copious and so connaturall a kind of eloquence wherein all things are so lively exprest the hand seemes to enter into contestation and to vie expresses with the tongue and to it in speaking labours and the significant varietie of important motions that it almost transcends the faculty of art to enumerate the postures of the hand and the discoursing gestures which present the interpretation of the minde
whose manifest habits rise to so high an account in the hand that if their totall summe could be cast up they would seeme to exceed the numericall store of words and the flowry amplifications of rhetoricall phrases

a corollarie of the speaking motions discoursing gestures or habits of the hand
with an historicall manifesto exemplifying the naturall significations of those manuall expressions
supplico
gestus


the stretching out of the hands is a naturall expression of gesture wherein wee are significantly importunate intreat request sue solicite beseech and ask mercy and grace at the hands of others
history the grave mistris of the rolls of action and manuall expressions from whose hand we receive the placard of time subscribed by the reverend hand of antiquity and made letters patents under the of truth as she is the most faithfull guide to the exemplary knowledge of any matter of fact passed so she presents a lively image of the hands present estate and by reflection of her light affords subsidiarie presidents and patternes of significant actions to come
for this of our discoursing

gestures contending with a high hand that no chiramnestia or act of oblivion should passe against nature by transcripts out of her owne chiridiographicall observations hath sufficiently testified the naturall signification of this chiridiome or proper form of speech in the beseeching hand

an example of this naturall gesture and expression we finde to have appeared in the hand of julius who endeavouring to satisfie the desires of constantius but the souldiers forcing him to accept of the stile of augustus with a resolute and well grounded minde withstood them all

and some one time shewing himself to be wroth and highly displeased other whiles stretching forth his hands requesting and beseeching them to forbeare their unseasonable offer
when annibal after the battaile of cannae had granted the romanes the favour and liberty to redeeme their prisoners and junius had ended his oration in the senate immediately

the multitude that were gathered together in the common place set up a lamentable and piteous cry and held out their hands to the beseeching the lords of the senate that they might have and injoy their children their brethren and kinsfolkes againe
the noblemen in the behalfe of coriolanus used

this gesture of the hand when sicinius the tribune had pronounced sentence of death upon him for some of them holding forth their hands to the people besought them not to handle them so cruelly
thus manlius and fulvius comming unto tiberius with teares in their eyes and holding up their hands besought

him to let the law agraria alone which

he would then have passed
and plutarch in that notable description of aemilius triumph relates how king perseus children were led prisoners with the traine of their schoolmasters and other officers and their servants weeping and lamenting holding out their hands unto

the people that looked upon them and taught the kings young children to doe the like to aske mercy and grace at the peoples hands
the force of this expression hath sometimes remained in the arme when the hand hath beene lost
for amynias the brother of aeschylus the tragedian when the people of athens would have stoned his brother for some impiety brought on the

stage he held up his elbow and arme without a hand lost at the fight at salamis by which spectacle the judges calling to minde the merits of amynias dismissed the poet

scripture the most sacred spring of pregnant metaphors and lending gestures among other of these kind of speaking apparitions or divine elegancies which are able to inrich a sanctified understanding the hebraismes and mysterious notions resulting from the properties of the hand doe everywhere obtaine by divine permission an ineffable latitude of significations whose vulgarismes varied through such multiplicity of senses are of that note and consequence that they much conduce to the advancement of the dignity and reputation of the hand
among other remarkable expressions borrowed from the hand wherein god is pleased to condiscend to the capacity of man and to cloath his expressions in the naturall language of our hand
that of

the prophesie of the prophet isaiah hath reference to this requesting gesture where the lord

complaining after the manner of men saith he had stretched out his hands all day to a rebellious people

oro gestus ii

to raise the hand conioyned or spread out towards heaven is the habit of devotion and a naturall and universall forme of prayer practised by those who are in adversity and in bitter anguish of minde and by those who give publique thankes and praise to the most high
thus we acknowledge our offences aske mercy beg reliefe pay our vowes imprecate complaine submit invoke and are suppliant
hence tis the scriptures doe most emphatically

define prayer by this outward signe not that this speaking habit of the hand is all or the most principall part of devotion for hyppocrites as if fired with zeale extend their armes and hands who yet but mock god by seeming to draw nigh unto him when their hearts belie their hands
but this gesture is an outward helpe unto devotion appointed by the ordinance of nature to expresse the holy fervour of our affections
for since it is impossible by reason of our great infirmitie we should with our soaring thoughts move beyond the centre of our bodies we stand in need of some outward help to declare the ascension of our inward zeale which we reveale by the extension of our hands which supplying the place of wings helpe our hearts in their flight upward
for unlesse our hearts are polluted with the leaven of hypocrisie they raise the heart to the

throne of grace before which we present our supplications
but the soul being invisible unles she shew her selfe by demonstration of gesture the hand was instituted surrogate and vicar of of the heart to testifie by outward gesture the offering and lifting up of the heart and that our prayers are seriously poured out from the bottome of our breast
hence in those sacred monuments that keepe alive the memories of the dead whether their effigies be exhibited in brasse or marble their monumentall statues are commonly hew'd into this forme of prayer
from the practice and naturall propensity of the hands to prayer as from the premisses athanasius as it is likely drew this conclusion that therefore man had hands given him that they might serve to necessary uses and to be spread forth and lifted up in offering prayer to him who made them
it being on all hands confest that this gesture is an originall rite and a piece of the discipline of nature polished also by the rule of reason and solemniz'd by the examples and exhortations of wise men
for there was no nation instructed in any kinde of piety who did not know before hand by a tacite acknowledgement of a god that the hands in prayer were to bee lifted up omnes homines

their manner was to turne themselves to the east with an erected countenance hands open spread lifted up and stretched out towards heaven
whence valerius flaccus

imperat hinc

alte phoebi surgentis ad orbem ferre

in this posture we finde antonius

lifting up his hands to heaven making a charitable prayer to the gods for his army when he was to encounter the parthians
and furius

camillus used the same gesture of his hands in his prayer at the taking of the citie veies

thus alexander in his third battaile with darius

before he gave charge upon the enemies he tooke his lance in his left hand and holding

his right hand unto heaven besought

the gods as calisthenes writeth that if it were true he was begotten of jupiter that it would please them that day to helpe him and to encourage the grecians
and the heathens when they came forth in the morning to plough they laid one hand upon the stilt of the plough and lifted the other up to ceres the goddesse of corne beginning both their actions of warre and peace with this gesture
so remarkable was the mixt and double office wherein nature hath interessed the hand
for as we raise these to heaven so with them we worke and the hand thrives but ill that workes unlesse it prayes which these heathens by the instinct of nature were wrought to acknowledge
and the most desperate atheists and hypocrites in some extremities and damages doe lift up their ioyned hands to heaven as a signe and token of some devotion though they have no faith nor beliefe
thus also they gave thanks
it is reported that when archidamas had overcome the arcadians and returned home

victorious to sparta from that tearlesse battaile neither man nor woman would keepe the city but came flocking down to the river side holding up their hands to heaven and thanked the gods as if their city had redeemed and recovered her shame and lost honour and began to rise againe as before it did
and to the signification of this gesture that of virgil may be referred

sustulit exutis vinclis ad sydera palmas

the lifting up the hands in prayer as it is a naturall expression so it seems necessary for

god requireth the whole man there being a woe pronounced to fainting hands that is which faint in prayer
when moses held up his hands israel prevailed but when moses let

his hands down amalech prevailed
and when moses hands were heavie they tooke a stone and put it under him and he sate upon it and aaron and hur stayd up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side so his hands were steady untill the going downe of the sunne and josuah discomfited amalech
upon which philo allegorizing shewes that victorious

gesture of moses hands doth signifie that by the vertue and intention of prayer all things are overcome or it implyes the elevation of the intellect to sublime contemplations and then amalech that is the affections are overcome

origen descanting upon the posture of moses

hands observes that hee did elevate not extend his hands that is his workes and actions to god and had not his hands deiected
he lifts up his hands that layes up treasure in heaven
for where we love thither resorts the eye and the hand
he that keepes the law orecomes he that doth not lets amalech prevaile

elias cretensis thus this gesture of moses

hands if you looke to that which falls under the aspect of the eye signifies prayer
hence in an old scheme of clodovaeus there are two armes erected to heaven supported by two others with this motto tutissimus with reference to the conquering hands of moses
to teach commanders

that piety strikes the greatest stroke in

all battailes
who with an over strained

phancie following his owne conceit makes use of the naturall expressions of the hand for the exalting the cimbrian or old teutonique tongue into the preheminencies of the originall language his superstitious observations thus to joyne the hands in prayer and so to applie their upper parts to the mouth doth signifie that men in prayer should seeke to be conjoyn'd to one that is most high and because prayer proceeds from the mouth and the hands upright with the mouth transverse seeme to delineate a roman he hath another inference from that similitude

the stretching out the hands to god is sometimes taken in scripture for the acknowledgement of an offence as in the prayer

of solomon at the consecration of the temple and solomon praying stretched forth

his hands to heaven after this manner and thus moses praying strsetched out

his hands unto the lord
thus judas macchabeus encountring the army of nicanor

stretched out his hands towards heaven and called upon the lord that worketh wonders
to the signification of anguish and affliction belongs that of the prophet jeremiah zion spreadeth forth her hands

and there is none to comfort her
for they who pray sometimes stretch out their hands somtimes lift them up
hence lauretus to spread out or extend the hand is to open dilate and unfold that which was straitned

and folded in
to spread out the hand is also to lift it up but to extend is to erect and

raise them up
so he the sacred sense of these speaking gestures of prayer
hillarie

very elegantly distinguisheth betweene the expansion and elevation of the hands which in this matter of prayer are promiscuously used in scripture
so upon that of the psalmist will

lift up my hands in thy name hee doth not take it for the habit of praying but for a declaration of a worke of a high elevation
so likewise upon such a passage of another psalme let my

prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice
he shewes that the apostle where he

exhorts them to lift up pure hands hee does not appoint a habit of praying but addes a rule of divine operation
so the noble prophet

when you spread forth your hands will hide mine eyes from you yea when you make many prayers will not heare if you extend your hands not if you lift them up but if you extend your hands because the habit of praier is in the spread out hands but the power of a perfect worke is in the elevation
therefore the lifting up the hands is an evening sacrifice
but this for all can finde is but the peculiar fancie of this father
for surely the elevation as well as the expansion or stretching out of the hands are both significantly naturall in this sense
indeed st hierome drawes these two

gestures of prayer into allegories not much unlike thus to send forth the hand to god as it were to seeke out for reliefe is to direct our actions to him and not to worke for vain glory
he also spreads forth his hands to god

who dilates in the evaporation of a vain mouth and who against the grace of the giver is proud of the virtue of his workes

calvin in his comment upon timothy upon

which place cornelius lapide hath also noted many things observing that the apostle hath put the signe of prayer for the thing signified sayes that this expression of gesture is very agreeable to true piety so the verity that is figured thereby doe answer the signification to wit that being by nature admonished that god is to be sought for in heaven that first wee should put off all terrene and carnall imaginations of him that nothing may hinder us in the raising of our selves above the world
idolaters and hypocrites in lifting up their hands in prayer are but apes who while they by the outward symbol professe to have their mindes erected upwards the first of them sticke in the wood and stone as if god were inclosed there the second sort intangled in vaine cares or wicked cogitations lye groveling on the earth and by a contradiction of gesture beare witnesse against themselves

the ancients are very copious in expressing these outward formes of devotion in the hands for they say the hands stretched out put forth holden abroad expansed and erected and all to imply the naturall piety of the hand in this expression
with tertullian the hands thus affected are with virgil holden abroad as nonnius interpreteth the action they are the open and extended hands
and in this gesture many things are contained

maldonat conceives the meaning of this naturall elevation of the hands is to teach us that heaven is the throne and as it were the cathedrall temple of god
pintus thinkes this gesture shewes that god is on high and that all things are to be hoped for at his hands

cresollius sayes that this deportment of our hands declares that we affectionately fly unto the protection of god our heavenly father
even as little children disabled by some fright with stretcht out hands run into the lap of their parents or as men in the midst of shipwracke stretch out their hands to some friendly saviour
for since the force of this organum organorum the hand the most excellent instrument of common life doth chiefly consist in three things in giving doing and repelling who lifts up his hands seems wholy to deliver and commit himself and all that he is into the sacred power of the godhead as if with david he had his soule in his hand from the of charity and the

of zeale both joyn'd together to make their intentions more acceptable as from the living censer or of prayer there ascends in a sweet kind of articulated silence the speaking savour of these significations

parent of the world god the maker of all things this soule all that am a thousand times due to thy majesty and gracious goodnesse render and refer to its fountaine and originall
what e're my hands can doe or my tacite understanding and industry endeavour let it be thine thee seduced by ill counsell have withstood and like a wretch rejected thy

gifts and by wicked machinations repelled and throwne them from mee
behold my hands which it thou please command to be bound and mee an unworthy traytor who have sinn'd with a high hand to be drawne to punishment who had not liv'd unlesse thou hadst lent mee life which have abus'd and rebelliously stretched out my hand against thee to my owne destruction and the reproach and dishonour of thy name
all these significant expressions as

cresollius hath happily observ'd are contain'd in this gesture

augustine very elegantly and sweetly gives us the retionality and religious conveniency of this manuall expression
when men in prayer

stretcht out their hands or use any visible expressions they doe that which is agreeable to the case of a suppliant although their invisible will intention of their heart be known to god neither doth hee stand in need of such declarations that the minde of man should bee laid open before him but by this gesture man doth more rouze up himselfe to pray and groane more humbly and fervently and know not how whereas these motions of the body cannot be done unlesse the inward motions of the mind precede the same thing againe being made externally visible that interiour invisible which caused them is increased and by this the affection of the heart which preceded as the cause before the effect for so much as they are done doth encrease
and indeed this outward addition or adjunct of piety the opening and lifting up of the hands is a naturall manifestation of the uprightnesse and integrity of the heart and

of the sincerity of the affections
for deceit naturally hath no wil though hypocrisie sometimes may affect to dilate and extend the hand
and the sympathy is so strong betweene the heart and the hand that a holy thought can no sooner inlarge the erected heart but it workes upon the hands which are raised to this expression and extended out to the uttermost of their capacities
upon this naturall motion or exposition of the minde saint chrysostome sets a morall glosse
this lifting up of our hands should put us in mind to take heed

of sin lest we defile our hands therewith
since it is very absurd that those who are to bee the trouchmen and interpretours of prayer and divine administrations should also be the instruments of wickednesse for if we say it is not honest for a man to pray with dirty and unwashen hands how much more naughtinesse will that expression be tainted with to lift up hands not dirty but defiled with the pollutions of sin
and in this sense washing of hands was used by most nations before prayer
this manuall of prayer as a helpe at hand the christians in all ages have diversly used for the furthering their devotion as may be collected out of the ecclesiasticall records of time
tertullian renders a

reason thereof thus christians pray with spread out hands because our hands are harmlesse because we are not ashamed and without a monitor because we pray from the breast
for the most part they lifted up
which tertullian would have modestly done not as who pray hand over head
for this grave father reporting and

praising the modesty and humility of the primitive christians hath left this caution for a rule in prayer adoring with modestie and humilitie we doe more commend our prayers to god not so much as our hands more loftily held up but temperately and honestly erected
sometimes christians did not indeed lift up their hands on high but did extend them out here and there into the figure of christs suffering
hence in a medall of gordian the godly there is

an image lifting up the spread out hands to heaven with this inscription fitted to the device piet as augusta
and eusebius

hath left a memoriall that constantine was wont to be figur'd in coines and painted tables with his hands holden abroad and his eyes lift up to heaven which he calls the habit and composition of prayer
doctor donne in reference to the symbolicall signification of the gesture calls it constantines catechisticall coyne

the same author in a sermon upon iob


upon these words not for any injustice in my hands also my prayer is pure according to his elegant way of descanting upon the emphaticall expressions of holy writ hath many notions about nocturnall and diurnall cleannesse and foulnesse of hands and observing that the holy ghost hath so marshalled and disposed the qualifications of prayer in that place as that there is no pure prayer without cleane hands which denote righteousnesse towards man comming to speake of the gesture and observing that moses prayer had no effect longer then his hands were lifted

all this saith he perchance therefore especially that this lifting up of the hands brings them into our sight then we can see them and see whether they be cleane or no and consider that if we see impurity in our hands god sees impurity in our prayer
can we thinke to receive ease from god with that hand that oppresses another mercy from god with that hand that exercises cruelty upon another or bounty from god with that hand that right from another and to adde by a little enlarging his owne words in another place
how can we expect god should open with his hands of benediction who shut up our hands and that which is due to another in them how much more then if we strike with those hands by oppression or as esaiah we lift up the bloudy hands of cruelty

at this day the common habit of praying in the church is as pertaining to the hands to ioyn the hands moderately lift them up or religiously cut them by ten parts into the forme of the letter holding them in that manner before the breast which manner of prayer cresollius calls manus decussatas
in the romish church which doth superabound in the externall adjuncts of devotion and where the rubriques direct to varying formes of manuall expressions at the word oremus there is alwayes annexed some emphaticall behaviour of the hand
hence in the masse when the priest saith oremus hee extendeth and then ioyns his hands
by the extension of his hands he gathereth as it were the hearts of the people by the joyning of his hands together he doth amasse them into

one which is the glosse of huelamus upon this

romish rite
the many gesticulations of the hands and fingers so ceremoniously troublesome in the masse whose mysterious senses bellarmine durandus in ritibus ecclesiae and gavantus in his large comment upon their rubriques hath so copiously explained was one thing that made the masse so uneasie to bee said of old by the hands of every sir iohn as requiring one very well trained up in their schoole of divine complements

this is the manuall of prayer and practice of picty commended by nature unto us as a faithfull assistant to our private devotions which expressed in one of the most significant dialects of the generall language of the body is more vocall and effectuall then the explications of the tongue and more religiously true to the soule in case of extremity which is manifest by their use in christian exercise when the voice cannot expresse or performe her office for the hand inabled by nature to supply the defect of a vocall interpretour hath continued the act of prayer and presented many visible petitions to the eye of compassion which understands the groaning gestures and dumb ejaculations of the hand
and this is often observed in religious men in extremity of sicknesse whose hands in the time of health having beene used to accompany and exhibit their requests to heaven as the last service they can doe the soule and body offer themselves in this evening sacrifice of life
to passe by common instances it is reported of that learned and reverend doctor of our church that

he was totus in his sacrifiis alwayes imploy'd in

this reasonable service god requires at our hands and toward the time of his dissolution his hands were never empty of prayer and when he could pray no longer voce with his voice yet manibus oculis by lifting up the hands and eyes hee prayed still and when weaknesse and necessity of nature had excluded these externall accidents of devotion the hands and voyce failing in their function with his heart he prayed still as was perceived in him by some outward tokens

ploro
gest
iii

to wring the hands is a naturall expression of excessive griefe used by those who condole bewaile and lament
of which gesture that elegant expositour of nature hath

assign'd this reason
sorrow which diminisheth the body it affects provokes by wringing of the minde teares the sad expressions of the eyes which are produced and caused by the contraction of the spirits of the braine which contraction doth straine together the moisture of the braine constraining thereby teares into the eyes from which compression of the braine proceeds the hard wringing of the hands which is a gesture of expression of moysture
this compectination or weeping crosse of the hand is elegantly described by apulcius in these words palmulis inter alternas digitorum vicissitudines super genua connexis

sic grabatum cessim insidens ubertim flebam
where as cresollins observes hee hath rightly conjoyned this gesture of the hands with weeping and teares
for tis the declaration of a mind languishing for grief and almost spent and wearied

with some vehement affliction
which the brother of basil the great elegantly setting out to our eyes saith complodis manus

digitos complicas atque tuis cogitationibus
so also dio chrysostomus among the arguments and signes of mourning and lamentation puts down

manum complicationes humilem{que sessionem
indeed the folding and wringing of the hands in the naturall equipage of sorrow hath ever passed for a note of lamentation
history the mistris of life and right hand of experience which is the mother of prudence holding up the mirrour to nature wherein she may see her own actions represented in their true and lively colours affords some confirming reflection of this gesture
wee reade that when heliodorus that

hated favourite of the emperour valens was dead and his corps carried forth to bee buried by the valens commanded that many should attend on foot yea and some also with hand in hand and fingers clutched one within another to go before the cursed coarse of that bloudy villaine
who had not the emperours command extorted this formality of sorrow from their hands had missed of so solemne exequies and interment

admiror
gest
iv

to throwup the hands to heaven is an expression of admiration amazement and astonishment used also by those who flatter and wonderfully praise and have others in high regard or extoll anothers speech or action
the first time that this expression appeared in the hand of man was certainly upon occasion of some new unexpected accident for which they

gave thankes to god who had so apparently manifested the act of his beneficence
and as it is a signe of amazement
tis an appeale unto the

deity from whose secret operation all those wonders proceed which so transcend our reason which while wee cannot comprehend wee raise our hands to heaven thereby acknowledging the hand and finger of god
and that this is a naturall and so by consequence an universall expression of the hand appeares by the generall use of this gesture with all nations
that passage of catullus is well known
ait hac manus{que tollens boni
to which intention of gesture horace alludes

importunus amat donec ohe jam

ad coelum manibus sublatis

to this appertaines that of cicero
hortensius aute vehementer quod quidem per petuo lucullo loquente fecerat ut etiam

manus saepe tolleret and that of his in another place

sustulimus manus ego ut balbus ut illud nescio quid non fortuitum sed divinum videretur
and to this is referred that of livie
ad quam vocem cum clamor ingenti alacritate sublatus esset ac nunc complexi inter se gratulentesque nunc

manus ad coelum tollentes

applaudo gest


to clap the raised hands one against another is an expression proper to them who applaud congratulate rejoice assent approve and are well pleased used by all nations
for applause as it is a vulgar note of encouragement a signe of rejoycing and a token and signe of giving praise and allowance doth wholly consist in the hands
whence cicero

populus romanus manus suas non in defendenda

libertate sed in plaudendo consumit
which hee spake of theatricall applause exhibited by the hand of old
xenophon expresseth this affection

of the minde in a very cleare and eloquent kinde of speech in these words primipulus qui nos proxime discumbebat rem intuitus manus invicem complosit ridensque laetabatur
and histaspas in the

same author speakes unto cyrus in these words unum solum ignoro quinam modo ostensurus sim me gaudere bonis tuis utrum manuum concussione utendum est an ridendum an aliuà faciendum this publique token hath beene of old and is so usuall in the assembly of a multitude when they cannot contain their joy in silence that there is nothing more common with them then by clapping their hands to signifie their exceeding joy and gladnesse of heart in so much as all histories both prophane and sacred abound with examples of this expression out of which infinite store shall produce but one or two for confirmation of this point
when iehoiadah the priest

caused ioash the sonne of ahazia to be crowned king and had brought him out and given him the testimony they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said god save the king
which gesture retaines the same signification in divers other places

of scripture
when caius valerius entred the city of rome ovant the affectionate favour of

the people that stood in the streets appeared by clapping of hands and great applause striving a vie to exceed the songues chaunted by the souldiers
when the senate had granted the

peoples desire that a commoner should be chosen consull with a nobleman and the dictator

had published the decree of the senate confirming their desire the common people were

so joyfull that they brought camillus home to his house with great shouts of joy and clapping of hands
when alcibiades had one

day in the market place given a largesse to the people out of his owne purse the people were so glad at it that they fell to shouting and clapping of their hands for thankfulnesse
the fourth day after the battaile fought by perseus king of macedon even as the playes and games were exhibited in the there

was heard suddenly at first a confused humming noise which spread all over the companies of the spectators that a field was fought in macedonie and perseus vanquished afterwards arose a more cleare and evident voice which grew at length to an open shout and clapping hands as if certaine newes had been brought of the same victory
the magistrates wondred thereat and made search after the author of so sudden a gladnesse but none would be found and then verily it passed away as the momentany joy of some vaine and uncertaine occurrence howbeit a joyfull presage of some good luck setled in mens hearts and remained behinde which was after confirmed by the true report of fabius lentulus and metellus sent from the consull

indignor
gest
vi

to smite suddenly on the left hand with the right is a declaration of some mistake dolour anger or indignation for so our learned humanicians understand this gesture usurping it often in this sense
seneca attributes this passion of the hand to anger for

in his description of an angry man he hath parum explanatis vocibus sermo praeruptus

saepius manus
and in another place shadowing out anger in her proper colours he sets her out thus dentes comprimuntur horrent ac surriguntur capilli spiritus ac stridens

articulorum ipsos torquentium sonns
and in another place
adjice articulorum crepitum cum seipsae manus frangunt

petronius that great doctor of iniquity and pleasure conspiring in the like sense of the same expression presents us with this gesture thus habited

manibus inter se usque ad articulorum strepitum contritis
and in another place he thus gives us the garb of anger and griefe

is manibus ingemnit
neither are examples wanting in histories to confirme the senses of this naturall expression
philo judaeus of caius the emperour boiling with anger and grievously fretting with indignation legens multam praese ferens ubi vero desiit

complosis manibus euge petroni inquit non didicisti audire imperatorem to confirme the naturall practice here of by divine authority and presidents taken out of the most sacred history
thus balack in token of anger smote his hands

together when he was wroth with balam that he would not curse the israelites as hee desired
to which answers that of the prophet ezekiel
thou

therefore sonne of man prophesie and smite hand to hand that is strike thy hand as men in griefe and anguish are wont to doe
the same signification of gesture hath that of the

same prophet
behold therefore saith the lord have smitten mine
hands upon thy covetousnesse that thou hast used and upon the bloud that

hath beene in the midst of thee that is in token of my wrath and vengeance

explodo
gest
vii

to clap the right fist often on the left palme is a naturall expression used by those who mocke chide brawle and insult reproach rebuke and explode or drive out with noise commonly us'd by the vulgar in their bickerings as being the scolds saunting dialect and the loud naturall rhetorique of those who declame at billingsgate
hence ovid not unskilfull

in this brawling property of the haud very ingeniously seignes the plerides as they were about to scould and to clap their hands with a disgracefull noise to have beene turned into pies and made sylvan scoulds
this which is but the repetition of that stroake used in anger and indignation is used in this sense by the mirrour of patience every man shall clap their hand's at him and hisse at him out of their

place
and the good man when his patience was tryed beyond sufferance fell into this habit of contention with his miserable comforters as appeares by the accusation of elihu
he addeth rebellion unto his sinne hee clappeth his hands amongst us and multiplieth his words against

god that is as the glosse on our bibles hath it he standeth stubbornly in maintenance of his cause
to this may bee referred that of the prophet ieremiah all that passe by clap their hands they hisse and wag the head at the

daughter of jerusalem
the same signification hath that of the prophet ezekiel because thou hast clapped thine hand and stamped

with the feet and rejoyced in heart with all thy

despite against the land of israel behold· therefore will stretch out mine hand upon thee

despero
gestus viii

to appeare with fainting and deiected hands is a posture of feare abasement of minde an abject and vanquished courage and of utter despaire
the prophet isaiah calls

this habit of or consternation the faint hand or the hand fallen downe
the prophet ezekiel and call this apparition of

feare the feeble hand
and the authour to the hebrewes most appositely the hands that hang down
the old annals of time and the journalls and diaries of common life which containe a narration and exposition of things done give the best patternes of the hands expressions as being the most naturall registers thereof in so much as there are no interpretours so proper or able to informe us of the validity and use of this languishing carriage and behaviour of the hand
an expression by gesture wee finde to have appeared in the hands of prusias king of bithynia a man of a most faint heart and abject spirit who when he came to italy to see the mansion place of the empire of the world when he entred into the senate standing at the gate of the court right over against the fathers demissis

manibus limen salutavit which are the words of polybius rehearsing a thing unworthy of royall majesty

otio indulgeo
gest
ix

to fold the hands is a gesture of idlenesse an expression often seene in the hands of lazy· lubbers amus'd with who keepe their dull hands so knit together to maintain a

drowsie league with sleepe for being loath to forgoe the pleasure of ease they by this gesture doe as it were allure and play the bawds to indulge and procure their lusts delight more sweetly to cease upon their lyther bodies
hence the aegyptian priests when they would exhibit an

expresse character of lazinesse or of a sluggish fellow good for nothing one who would scarce entertaine a busie thought lest it should worke some disturbance in his breast or rowze his hands from the complacency of their embosom'd rest they use to decipher a dull of this lowzy tribe with his hands thus enterlac'd as parallels in his bosome as if they had there taken up their habitation or did lye skulking to avoid worke which is a lion in their way
this gesture of the hands as it is the sluggards common guise who demands a little more folding of the hands and out of love to ease often neglects what his mouth requires at his hands contented so he have from hand to mouth as if hee hated the more provident extension of a thought is significantly brought in sacred writ by a metaphor to upbraid and note out the despicable state of fooles and sluggards loyterers of no esteeme since the wisdome of man doth much consist in his hands
salomon unfolding the nature of a sloathfull person who

foldeth up his hands each hand holding as it were the other from worke and hideth his hand in his bosome in this last posture he excellently sets out the nature wickednesse and

punishment of floath
the nature of it in noting the sweetnesse of it to a sluggard in that his hand is in his bosome hugging as it were his

owne lazinesse
the wickednesse of it in that his hand is hidden sloathfulnesse being so shamefull a thing that it needeth to be concealed
the punishment of it in that the sloathfull man starveth himselfe
and in another place he is said to

hide his hand in his bosome that none might finde it lest by taking him thereby hee might raise him up or else as if he feared some censorius who calling to see the hands of men refused those that had soft hands as unworthy to be citizens of rome
emphatically in one place of the proverbs of salomon the slacke hand

of the sluggard is most directly translated the hand of deceit
rightly doth the originall call it a hand of deceit because for the most part the lazy hand being not able to sustaine it selfe betakes it selfe to cousenage and deceit
the originall word in the fore part of the verse properly signifies the bowing of the hand because deceit is hollow and tis with the hollow of the hand that the sleights of deceit are practised
in the latter part of the verse the word signifies the whole hand the strength of the hand for that it is which diligence useth and by that it maketh rich

the garb of such men who sit crowching in the world with their arms their mouths gaping and their feet in one shooe leading rather a bestiall then a humane life a famous lawyer doth graphically describe out of eccles thus

commentators referre that anthropopeia of the royall prophet draw thy right hand

to hold the fingers inserted between each other is their sluggish expression who are fallen into a melancholy muse
to the signification of this gesture accords the oration of sextus tullius unto sulpitius dictator you our generall deem

us your army to be handlesse heartlesse and armourlesse for what else may we thinke of it that you an old experienced captaine a most valiant warriour should sit as they say with one hand in another doing nothing
hence

manibus compressis sedere in the adage is all one with nihil facere otio indulgere aliis obesse
for this gesture is thought to have a tacite force to damp the lively spirit of mirth and friendly communication
hence tis in vulgar practice to accuse such men whose hands in company fall into this posture as remora's unto the happy birth and progresse of conceit and for dull schismatiques that deny themselves to those with whom they converse for such whose thoughts stray out of season minding not what others doe or say by a mentall sequestration withdraw their soules as twere from their bodies and while they their private thoughts exprest oftentimes by this disrespect of the hand they seeme no other then to make a soloecisme in society
hence this gesture by the superstitious ancients was held a note of impediment and hath passed time out of minde for a kinde of secret sorcery
whereupon the romane

senate gave out a solemne prohibition that in all consultations held by any prince or

or any generall of an army or any person that was present at any mysticall solemnity none should presume to fit or stand crosselegged or in the foresaid manner hand in hand
supposing this gesture did hinder the progresse and event of any act in hand or any consult which by advice was to bee ripened for an expedition
they thought it also witchcraft but to sit by one that had a practicall designe upon health by the receit of any medicine either inwardly or outwardly appli'd
nay they thought this posture was of force alone to hinder such who were in labour and did then need lucina's hand and that such could not bee delivered as long as any one present held the hands thus mutually inwrapped which piece of forcery was the worser in case the party did hold them about one or both his knees
this was well seene by the lady alcmena when jealous juno set one

and to hinder her delivery as the story goes
but the contrary gesture implyed quicke labour or the felicity of being delivered
thus in a medall of julia the

godly the happy fruitfulnesse of childbirth is implyed wherein venus holdeth a javelin in her left hand shewing her right hand stretched out and spread with this inscription venus genetrix
but this placing one hand upon another was ever held unluckie

manum manui superponere

innocentiam ostendo
gest
xi

to imitate the posture of washing the hands by rubbing the back of one in the hollow of the other with a kind of detersive motion is a gesture sometimes used by those who would professe their innocency and declare they have no hand in that foule businesse not so much as by their manuall assent as it were assuring by that gesture that they will keepe their hands undefiled and would wash their hands of it nor have any thing to doe therein
a gesture very significant for the hands naturally imply as it were in hieroglyphique mens acts and operations and that cleansing motion denotes the cleannesse of their actions
as this expression is heightned by the addition of water tis made by the aegyptians the hieroglyphique of innocency

in token also of innocency this gesture was commanded the elders of the neighbour

cities in case of murther
and it was practised by pilate when he would have transferred from himselfe unto the jewes the guilt of our saviours blood who when he saw he could not prevaile with the multitude for the delivery of christ he called for water and washed his hands am innocent

saith hee of the bloud of this just man looke you to it
to this gesture that of the psalmist referres will wash my hands in innocency

and from this gesture came the adage concerning mutuall good offices manus manum digiti interim digitos lavant

lucri apprehensionem plaudo
gest
xii

to rub the palmes of the hands together with a kind of applause much after the manner as some are

wont to do who take paines to heat their hands is an itching note of greedy haste many times used by such who applaud some pleasing thought of deceit that they have in their heads
this confesse is somewhat a subtile notion yet noted in some men by phisiognomers

and to be found by an observation and marking of nature for every minute thing if wee waite and watch the time of relation will appeare an expression from whose remonstrance wee may take arguments for they issue out into notes and breaking the barre of silence by token speake and informe the eye

libertate resigno
gestus xiii
to hold forth the hands together is their naturall expression who yeeld submit and resigne up themselves with supplication into the power of another
this with the ancients was manum dare
hence ovid

omnia te ad te

sua brachia tendent
to illustrate this by examples taken out of the ancient registers of time
thus vercingetorix

falling on his knees before caesar and holding forth his hands exhibited the gesture of a suppliant
and thus diridates king of

armenia exhibited the same obedience of gesture and submission to nero
thus the legates of decebalus with ioyned hands after the manner

of captives presented themselves unto the senate upon which peace concluded trajan triumphed over the dacians and was sirnamed dacieus
the romanes that were in the galley that were carrying the cup of gold to delphos

made of the jewels of the roman ladies when hard by the island of aeolus they were set upon

by the gallies of the lipparians they used this expression for they held up their hands and intreated making no resistance
but for the signification of this gesture in submission plutarch is very emphaticall who declaring the pride and power of tigranes king of armenia sayes that hee had ever many kings in his court

that waited on him but amongst others he had foure kings that waited continually on his person as footmen for when he rode abroad any whither they ran by his stirrop in their shirts
and when he was set in his chaire of state give audience they stood on their feet about his chair holding their hands together which countenance shewed the most manifest consession and token of bondage that they could doe unto him
as if they had shewed thereby that they resigned all their liberty and offered their bodies unto their lord and master more ready to suffer then any thing to doe

protego
gest


to extend out the right hand by the arme foreright is the naturall habit wherein we sometimes allure invite speak to cry after call or warne to come bring into exhort give warning admonish protect pacifie rebuke command justifie abow enquire direct instruct order shew a generous confidence hardinesse and authority give free liberty of speech manifest a readinesse to answer and make an apalogy for our selves and appeare to undertake a businesse
all which acceptions of this gesture though they more easily fall in the compasse of observation then they can be exemplified by authenticall authority yet histories have taken

notice of most of the expressions of this gesture of the hand
that it is significant in the six first senses may bee collected out of many ancient writers
thus memnius regulus the consull in the senate and presence of the senatours called sejanus unto him
for thus dion sets it downe


manu portenta sejane ades hue
and cyrus when any of his friends were seene crowding towards him as xenophon hath recorded it

protensa manu eos accersebat
the same gesture of invitation ahasuerus used to esther when he signified her comming was according to his will
wisedome also cloathes

her words in the language of this gesture
because have called ye refused have stretched out my hand and none would regard
the psalmist acknowledges himselfe to have used this gesture
have called upon thee
have

stretched out my hands unto thee
this indicative gesture of the hand our savior used to direct and instruct the jewes who were

his brethren when stretching out his hand to his disciples he said behold my mother and my brethren
flavius flaccus made

use of this warning gesture of the hand instead of speech for when mutius began to call the tribes of the people to give their voices for the establishing of some new lawes propounded by tiberius gracchus in favour of the people and he could not proceed according to accustomed order in the like case for the great noise the hindermost made thrusting forward and being driven backe and one mingling with the other in the meane time flavius flaccus one of the senatours got up into a place where all the people

might see him and when he saw his voice could not be heard of tiberius hee made a signe with his hand that hee had some matter of great importance to tell him
tiberius who soone understood this gesture of his hand bade them make a lane through the preasse
so with much adoe flavius came at length unto him and bewray'd a conspiracy against him
valentinian

with good successe used this gesture of pacification and rebuke when hee was pronounced before the whole army soveraigne ruler of the empire
for when hee addressed himselfe to make a premeditated speech as he put forth his arme that he might speake more readily there arose a great mumbling that out of hand there might a second emperor be declared wth him valentinian fearing to what the souldiers confident boldnes might prove holding up happily his right hand as a most hardy and redoubted prince daring to rebuke some of them as seditious and stubborne delivered his minde without interruption of any
the emperour having ended his speech which an unexpected authority had made more confident appeared them and won them all to his minde which was to choose his companion who took afterwards unto him to be colleague in the empire his brother valens
that this gesture is significant to protect appeares by most passages of holy writ intimating the powerfull and gracious protection of god
where the expressions by an anthropopeia are taken from this gesture
thus god having put moses in the cleft of the rocke covered him with his hand while he passed by
and tis noverinus

his observation that with the hebrewes

caph signifies both the hand or the hollownesse of the hand and a cloud
hence pagninus turns protegam te manu mea into operiam te nube mea a good coherens saith he manus nubis nexus
in this sense that of the prophet isaiah is to bee

taken under the shadow of his hand hath he hid me
that is he hath taken me into his protection and defence
and the metaphors of an outstretched arme and high hand are very frequent in scripture to shadow out the powerfull protection of god in the two degrees of it the ordinary and extraordinary
for in this representation of power there is the hand and the arme the mighty hand and out stretched arme two degrees of power both great but one greater that of the hand is great but ordinary that of the arme is greater and commeth forth but upon extraordinary occasions every thing we put not to the armes end
and their hands are properly said to be shortned that have lost the power to save and protect a phrase much used in holy writ by the prophets speaking in his name who made the hand the naturall hieroglyphique

of power
this gesture doth naturally import command
hence kings are said to have long hands as the romane poet

nescit

longas regibus esse manus

the hand found under the table as vespasian was

at dinner signified as the southsayers did then interpret that command should one day come to his hand and this was before he was emperor
and a greeke poet very learnedly praising caesar sayes his right hand was mighty to command which by its majestique power and authority

did quell the fiercenesse and presumptuous audacity of barbarous men
the second

fall of dagon the idoll before the arke of god by a flat acknowledgement confirmes this naturall signification in the hand
for his head falling off from his body and the hands from the armes shewed that it had not power nor understanding in the presence of god since the head fell off which is the seat of reason and knowledge and the hands by which wee ex strength were sundred from the armes
in the sense of direction jeroboam stretched

out his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him but his hand hee put forth against the prophet dried up and hee could not pull it in againe unto him
foelix the governour

made this signe unto paul to give him leave to speake
and thus when agrippa said unto

paul thou art permitted to speake for thy selfe paid stretched out the hand and for himselfe

triumpho gest
xv

to put out the raised hand and to shake it as it were into a shout is their naturall expression who exalt brag boast triumph and by exultant gesture expresse the of their joy they also who would declare their high applause or would congratulate and they who have drunke doe commonly use the same gesture
in congratulatory exclamations either in the behalfe of our selves or others welfare it is usuall and naturall
examples whereof are yet fresh in the life of memory
for we read that when the antiochians understood that was comming to their city they could not

containe themselves within their walls for

but all went out to meet him and not only men but women and children expecting his comming
stounds off and when he approached unto them they holding up their unto him him with great joy and acclamations
hence israel is said to have gone out of

aegypt with a high hand that is with great joy and boldnesse
and this and exalation of the hand in signification of mirth jollity pleasure and delight is so grounded in nature that it is the common custome of all nations when they are tickled with joy that cannot be contained from breaking out into gesture out goes the hand so the prince and father of poets

deficiunt risu

per aera palmas

for the hand anointed as it were with the same oyle of gladnesse where with the heart is replenished signifies its sensibility of the enlargement of the heart by this amplification of gesture and naturall periphras of joy

silentium postulo
gest


the becking with the raised hand hath beene ever with all nations accounted a signe of and and intreating a favourable silence
and how considerable an expression this gesture of the hand was ever accounted in this businesse may be collected out of the office of the common cryer whom wee

finde in the monuments of the ancients commanding silence by the hand alone without the voice
whence that of dion may receive illustration
cum

manum porresset esset que ob eam causam consequutum ut est consuetudo


which gesture if it were used by the cryers of courts of justice would be more proper and significant to procure silence then by making more noise to engender peace and their loud way of reclaiming one auricular disturbance with another
the learned inventions of the ancients do ordinarily allude to this expression
seneca that witty contriver of that abusive play

of the death of claudius caesar which he called apocolocynthosis or immortality gotten by mushromes very elegantly brings in claudian the emperour commanding silence with this cking of the hand
heliodorus in his

history which hee preferred before his bishopricke in that passage where the people affected with joy and pittie at the strange hap that cariclia was knowne to be hydaspes daughter would not heare the cryer that commanded silence makes hydaspes himselfe to stretch out his hand to appeare them and did them be still
and barclay brings in euphormio when there

was a noise that he could not bee heard with this gesticulation of his hand signifying that he had somewhat to say unto them
prophane histories that containe a relation of things really done are not barren in this expression of the hand
for when titus was returned to rome after the destruction of jerusalem and his father vespasian and hee triumphed in common

as soone as they were set in their ivory tribunals the souldiers with loud voice declared their valour and fortitude vespasian having received their prayses they offering still to speake on in his commendations he beckned with his hand and made a signe unto them to bee

silent
when commodus the emperour was set in his throne to behold those famous actors which were to celebrate a sacred agon or pageant in

honour of jupiter capitolinus and the theater full of spectatours before any thing was said or acted on the stage suddenly there starts out one in a philosophers habit with a staffe in his hand and a scrip on his shoulder halfe naked who running to the midst of the stage stood still and with his hand for silence discovered the treason of perennius to commodus
thus drusus being sent to appease the rebellion

in pannonia standing up upon the tribunall beckoned with his hand for silence to be made
and after constantine the emperor was baptized having caused a throne to bee erected in the palace of trajan he declared with the eloquence of a monarch the reason which had moved him to alteration of religion
his oration being heard of all the world with great applause

in such sort that for the space of two houres the cryes of a great many were heard which made acclamations at length the emperour rose up and making a signe with his hand required silence which instantly made all that great multitude hold their peace
the most sacred history is not without examples of holy men who have significantly made use of this expression of the hand
for wee reade that peter

beckond with his hand unto them that were gathered together in maries house to hold their peace
thus paul stood up and beckond with

his hand and said men of israel and ye that fear god hearken
and when claudius lysi the chiefe captaine had given paul licence to

speake unto the people paul stood upon the greices of the castle into which they were leading

him and beckond unto the people and when there was made a great silence he began his apology in the hebrew tongue
alexander likewise

used this becking with the hand when hee would have excused the matter unto the people
in the originall peter is said undefined span alphabet manu silentio postulato as one translation anxuere manu ut tacerent as beza in the others the word undefined span alphabet is left out for the becking motion of the hand upon such occasions cannot well be understood otherwise then for a signe of reaving audience

gestus xvii

to lift up the right hand to heaven is the naturall forme and ceremony of an oath used by those who call god to witnesse and would adjure confirme or assure by the obligation of an oath
an expression first used by the hands of the ancient patriarchs and is thought to have flowed from god himselfe who in many places of holy writ is brought in speaking of himselfe to have used this gesture for

confirmation of his gracious promises by the outward solemnity of an oath
hence it was that abraham said unto the king of sodome have lifted up my hand unto the lord that is have sworne that will not take from a

thread even to a shooe latchet unto this naturall expression the psalmist alludes he lifted up his hand that is he swore
and to the signification of this gesture of the hand some

referre that passage of the psalmist whose right hand is a right hand of falshood that is they

have forsworne and broke their vow
hence by a forme of speech taken from this expression to lift up the hand in the scripture phrase is

the same as to sweare and take a solemne oath
with reference to the manifest attestation and significant obligatory force of the hand in this businesse the late nationall covenant was expresly ordered to be tooke with the right hand held up on high
the angels also when they sweare doe it not without this manuall asseveration for the angell in the apocalyps that

iohn saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth when he sware that there should be time no longer lifted up his hand to heaven
this vowing expression of the hand marius used in

the battaile of the cymbres when he promised and vowed a hecatomb or solemne sacrifice of an hundred oxen
thus also catulus vowed to build a temple to fortune for that day

asseveratione deo attestor
gestus xviii

to extend and raise up both the hands to heaven is an expression of establishment and a most strong kinde of asseveration implying as it were a double
there is a passage in the prophesie of the prophet daniel

which doth confirme and illustrate this expression
and heard the man cloathed in linnen which was upon the waters of the rivers when he held up his right hand and his left unto heaven which was a double oath as our glosse hath it
lauretus upon this

place saith that the lifting up of the right and the left hand signifies an oath with a commination and a promise
ovid well knowing this double forme of an oath describing philomela frighted

at the comming of her sister progne as she strove

to sweare and call the gods to witnesse to the purity of her thoughts and that she was compelled to that dishonourable fact very elegantly makes her hold up her hands for spéech
such an asseveration of gesture lately observed in some at the publique taking of the last nationall covenant who as conceived rather out of a zealous earnestnesse to ingage themselves in the cause then out of any affectation or privity to this double formality of a vow tooke the covenant with both their hands held up
in the same posture of expression we finde gadatas

the eunuch in xenophon lifting up his hands to heaven taking an oath

suffragor gest


to hold up the hand is a naturall token of approbation consent election and of giving suffrage
an expression of the hand so common that chirotonia which properly is this gesture of the hand is usurped per metalepsin connexi pro suffragio
to this declaration of the hand that elegant metaphor of the prophet zephanie is referred the deepes made a noise and lift up their hands on high that is shewed

signes of their obedience and voluntary inclination as by lifting up their hands
and when esàras blessed god the people lifting up their hands to their audible added a

kinde of visible amen signed by this gesture of assent which is as much in the language of the hand as so be it
tully makes mention of this expression if those decrees that are received

be rightly expressed and singular excellent not declared so by judgements nor authorities nor

bound by an oath but by holding up the hand and with great acclamation of the affected multitude
hence both the phrase and practice of this gesture of approbation so frequently occurres in xenophons orations who having made a proposition to the people to whom

this seemes good saith he let him hold up his hand and all of them held up their hands
at the end of which oration chirisophus approving what xenophon had said requires the same expression at the peoples hands in the same phrase saying he who approves of these things let him signifie his assent by holding up his hand
then all of them held up their hands
and xenophon arising againe to speake concludes thus who assents to these things let him hold up his hand which they did accordingly
and so in many other places of his oration
the signification of suffrage in this gesture may be further illustrated by the practice of the athenians in that passage of

thucidides where when cleon and diotatus had both delivered their opinions the one most opposite unto the other about the alteration of the cruell decree of the athenians against the myteleans the athenians were at contention which they should decree and at the holding up of hands they were both sides almost equall
and one sort of the athenian magistrates were undefined span alphabet magistrates chosen by this gesture

which indeed is a most significant expression of the hand so naturally doth the hand imply the will and consent thereof for what wee put our hand unto we are infallibly understood to will and intend and with counsell and advice to

undertake and promise our concurrence

respuo
gestus xx

the flirting out of the back part of the hand or of the turning palme is their naturall expression who would refuse deny prohibit repudiate impute or to lay to ones charge reject or pretend to lay for an excuse or would and hit one in the teeth with a thing and signifie disdaine
the minde of man being moved by distaste in some significant gesture to utter and disclose her hatred and detestation when she is displeased with any she usually gives intelligence of her dislike in a discharge implyed by the significant dismission of the hand and such like signes representing by gesture a willingnesse to rid her hands of them
and this expression doth arise from the same cause that trembling and horrour do namely

from the retiring of the spirits but in a lesse degree
for the shaking of the hand is but a slow and definite trembling
and is a gesture of slight refusall and dislike being used often by those who refuse a thing or warne it away
this was the entertainment antipater found at the hands of his father
for when he

boldly came neare as though he would have saluted him herod stretched out his hand and shaking his head gave him the repulse taxing his presumption for daring to offer to embrace him when he was guilty of so many treacheries against him
as it is a gesture that naturally without speech forbids it was used by augustus when with his countenance and hand he repressed those unseemly flatteries which

were offered unto him
caecina in his dreame

used the like expression to the ghost of quinctilius

varus stretching out his inviting hands towards him which he thrust backe refusing to follow
and to this gesture as conceive may that passage of the prophet zephanie

concerning the destruction of nineveh bee referred every one that passeth by her shall hisse and wag his hand that is shall expresse his detestation
although ribera and others give it

the sense of astonishment and insultation

invito
gestus xxi

to shew forth the hand and so forthwith to call backe as it were and bring it againe unto us with a waving motion is a naturall gesture and a vulgar compellation which we significantly use in calling for men whom we bid to come neare and approch unto us which alluring habit in this matter is very naturall ready and commodious to explaine our minde and will wherein there is a certain kind of forme or semblance of the thing signified
for wee seeme by this gesture to draw them to us
to the signification of this gesture appertaines that of the prophet isaiah shake the hand that they

may goe into the gates of the nobles
that is make a signe unto them to come by this inviting motion of the hand
to this vocatiue alluring and inticing compellation of the hand propertius seemes to allude

dimitto
gestus xxii

to wag and wave the hand from us is an expression by gesture significant to prohibit bid one be gone keepe off forbid dismisse and bid farewell and adieu in which there is a certaine forme of the thing signified for we seeme by this gesture to put from us
nothing more ordinary in the occurrences of common life then this gesture practised in these senses a common custome to bid one keepe on his way and proceed who is returning to us to shake our hand as farre as ever we can see to bid our friends farewell and adieu
ovid according the ingenious way of invention in poets to heighten their fictions and to set an artificiall glosse of truth upon them that they may seeme more probable upon every occasion brings in the personages of his story using these naturall expressions of the hand
thus he brings in june

bidding iris hasten on a message on which shee was sending her doing it by shaking her hand into this naturall expression
and bringing

in ceyx going to sea and taking leave of his wife alcynoe when he was gone aboard and lanched

out she raising up her humid eyes espyeth him in the poope of the ship shaking his hand bidding her thereby adieu which she answered by the same motion and loving pursuit of gesture the usuall consequence of expression with those who have formerly shewed themselves ioath to depart
and bringing the ghost of

ceyx appearing to his wife alcynoe in a dream to be drowned at the end of his imaginary speech he seems to adde tears and this departing gesture of his hand bidding her for ever farewell
burton in his symptomes of

when anger a fit of the invading appetite hath tooke hold of our spirits and that we are incensed by

some affront we cannot brooke we use to threaten to call the trespasser to account by this gesture of the hand occasioned by the violent propensity of the minde and strong imagination of the act of revenge
←hence phisiognomists in reference ad morem apparentem or according to their rule of apparence observing the fashion of men

in this effect of passion in the hand conclude such persons to be hasty cholericke revengefull and apt to take or give offence who customarily use to hold their hand in this posture
if we should goe over the chronicles of all ages and trace this naturall gesture of the hand through those records which beare witnesse of times and the manners of men we should meet with many examples of this angry expression of the hand
some few copies of this originall affection will serve to confirme and illustrare the acception of this gesture in this sense and signification
thus leo armenus emperour entring into the prison

by night and seeing michael balbus and the warden of the prison with him and almost asleep declared his anger by the agitation of his hand
papias the warden fearing the anger of the emperour in conclusion conspired with the same michael and on the very night of the nativity of our saviour slew the emperour
thus the souldiers of vitellius army bent

their fists against the ambassadours of the helvetians who came to treat that their city might not be razed which the souldiers gréedy of revenge had importunately called for to be razed and vitellius for his part spared no threats
thus the senate bent their fists against sarielenus vocula and ceased not to offer violence untill he had departed the house
thus also agrippina

mad and wilfull after her favourite pallas was displaced from the charge that claudius had given him gave out threatning and thundering

speeches yea not forbearing the princes eares and after her bitter threats bent her fist toward nero
thus the souldiers in pannonia

threatned with the fists those they met

of the guard or caesars friends and familiars as desirous to picke quarrells and raise sedition
also were feared threatning

with words and fists their patrons and masters
the italian vulgar doe most resent the indignity of this minatory agitation of the hand exhibited against them

mendico
gestus xxiv

to hold out the hand hollow in manner of a dish is their habit who crave beg covet and shew a gréedy readinesse to receive and there is a certaine forme or semblance of the thing implied in this unusuall capacity of the hand
from the naturall signification of this posture that biting adage had its originall which taxeth the lucrativs gréedinesse of the athenians atheniensis vel moriens

cavat manum
this gesture of receit to an ingenious and honest man hath been accounted a kinde of reproach as appeares by the witty saying of julian the emperour
for when by a certaine solemn order or custome there were certaine messengers or pursivants brought into the consistory

to receive gold among others one of the company tooke it not as the manner is in the lappet of his mantle spread abroad but with the hollow ball of both hands and with that these pursivants or intelligencers quoth the emperour can skill to catch and not to latch money
hence it was that the hand of ruffinus governour of the east under honorius the emperour

was carried about through new rome after his death in mockery fashioned after this manner which claudian hath elegantly expressed in his death

dextra quinetiam ludo concessa vagatur
aera petens paenas{que animi persolvit avari

terribili lncro

vivos{que imitata retentus

cogitur adductis digitos inflectere nervis

corippus very ingeniously shadows out the rapacity of a company of plebeians inferred from this gesture of the hands



palmas{que capaces

and a little before he said



exertas tendere dextras

this entertainment marcus antoninus the imperiall philosopher received at the hands of the

gréedy multitude when he came to rome
for when in an oration he made to the people among other things he had said that he had been absent in his travells many years the multitude cried out eight and with stretched out hands signified how they craved that they might receive so many aurei for a congiary at which the emperour smiled and said also eight and afterwards gave them eight aurei a piece so great a summe as they never received

at any emperours hands before
pierius saith he had seen the signe of philemon in rome holding a booke shut and tyed very streight in his left hand and his right hand dish'd in this manner so that he seem'd to demand the price which unlesse they paid him downe in his hand they should not have his booke for they report him to have beene a writer of comedies who was wont to sell his labours at a very deare rate
and aristophanes hath a jest in one of his comedies where phidolus brings in the gods for

an example to whom when we tender supplication

for some good they stand holding their hand upwards not as they would give but as they would receive somewhat
barclay

who is every where very elegant in his allusions to naturall gestures reflecting upon the similitudes between this gesture and the posture of the hand in giving brings in euphormio describing the statue of a goddesse that held her left hand very open but stretched out her right hand with such a womanish feigning and colourable pretence that you could not tell whether she had rather give or take
this is the beggars craving posture
yet covetousnesse hath bowed the hands even of emperours to the significant practice thereof
for suetonius reports that octavius

augustus caesar by occasion of a vision by night begged yearly upon a certaine day money of the people and held out his hand hollow to those who brought him brazen dodkins or mites called asses
and the same author hath observed as much in vespasian who was so

famous for raising profit out of his subjects urine and his dulcis odor lucri ex re qualibet
for when certaine ambassadours brought him word that there was decreed for him at the common charges of thè state a image that hee would cost no meane summe of money he commanded to raise the same immediately shewing therewith his hand hollow

munero
gestus xxv

to put forth the right hand spread is the habit of bunty liberality and a frée heart thus we reward and friendly bestow our guists
hence to open the hand

in the hebrew phrase implyes to be and liberall
for the hebrewes when they would expresse a profuse munificence they say jadpethucha that is manum apertàm

from whence perchance the turkes borrowing the conceit are wont to set forth liberality by an open hand
the sonne of sirach knowing that the exercise of bounty and prodigality requires in a manner the like gesture and expression of the hand speaking of the unjust wasting of his goods saith that while he openeth his hand he shall rejoyce
and the greekes in old time saith pliny called the span or space of the hand from the thumb to the little fingers

end doron which is the reason that gifts be in their language called dora because they bee presented with the hand
hence phisiognomists say such who customarily use to hold the

hand extended out are of a liberall complexion of minde arguing from this liberall property of the hand
and there is a tradition our midwives have concerning children borne open handed that such will prove of a bountifull disposition and
infants indeed for the most part come into the world with their hands clos'd thereby notifying as a rabbi observes

that god hath given them the riches of this world and as it were shut them up in their hands whereas on the contrary dying men are wont to extend and stretch out their hands and fingers thereby willing to signifie that they relinquish the world and have no longer to doe with the things thereof
which is the only good action the miser doth who when death opens and unlockes his hand

doth by this necessary posture of bounty give away and bequeath and as it were manumit what he could no longer from the next possessor
bellarmine relates a story of stephen king

of hungary whose hand was found whole and uncorrupt after his death
and casting in his minde what might be the reason why god was pleased miraculously to preserve his right hand onely with the skinne bones and nerves when the other members were resolved into their first elements delivers his opinion thus truly thinke that in this miracle god was willing to shew the depth of his divine councell that charity excells all other vertues
deservedly therefore did the right hand of this holy king remain uncorrupt which was alwayes flourishing with the blossomes of mercy and which in relieving and distributing gifts to the poore was never empty or indisposed
god indeed who opens with his hand and filleth every living thing with his blessings out of his infinite bounty deales out liberally his divine almes to his creatures with both his hands
whence divines distinguish the gifts of god into those of his right hand and those of his left to wit into spirituall and temporall
dextra dei est unde grata proveniunt
hence the aramites by a right hand understand the effuse of god
maldonat

commenting upon the words of our saviour let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth gives a reason why in this place contrary to the enstome of scripture the left hand is named before the right and action attributed to the right hand and knowledge to the left
for it is therefore done saith hee because wee are

wont to reach out our almes which our saviour there speakes of with our right hand hence called manus eleemosinaria and not with our left and al other works that are done with the hand the right hand does them the left as a helper doth assist so that if it had eyes it could not bee ignorant what the right hand did wherefore christ would have us so to exercise this hand with workes of charity that our left hand which is wont to be not onely conscious but accessory to all the actions of the right hand should not so much as know or take notice thereof
cresollius judiciously scanning these words of our saviour let not thy left hand know what thy

right hand doth tells us that it is a symbolicall expression very like to the hieroglyphiques of the aegyptians and therefore the force and sense of this admonition is to be sought out of the nature and usuall signification of both the hands
as for the right hand it is altogether open free and manifestly put in action
wherefore for its part it denotes an ingenuous candor and virtue whose glory is most perspicuously set out by action but more especially the right hand signifieth liberality and for that cause chosen to bee the hieroglyphique of a most beneficent and plentifull largesse whereas the left hand hath a contrary genius and is observed to be of a close and retired nature this niggard out of a skulking disposition affecting secresie and the subtile leisure of a thrifty vacation
so that this symboll of our saviour insinuates thus much if thou art disposed to communicate thy goods to relieve the wants of thy brother and to shew forth the liberality of thy minde take not counsell of thy

left hand minde not what the covetous desire of goods and the thirst of having require at thy griping hand let the right hand prevaile with thee the index of beneficence and pledge of commiseration the accuser of covetousnesse
let that the left hand earth it selfe in avarice and keepe silence by an uncharitable retention which doth not love to scatter but to snatch away not to bestow but a long time to retaine
how many scaevola or donatists in matter of bounty doe our times afford within the frozen hold of whose sparing hand charity is quite starv'd with cold and how many who fearing the moralists bis dat qui cito dat with the old courtiers glosse that the sooner suiters are dispatched the sooner they will returne againe by sinister delay hold them in suspence while their courtesies hang to their fingers ends like and will not come away these the heathen man would call viseata beneficia we

favours
these men as if they were restrained by some sumptuary law made against the naturall munificence of the right hand refer all matters of beneficence to the penurious discretion of the left hand
nay are there not some who as if they held ignorance to bee the mother of thrift to elude this nesciat of the gospel have made their hands strike a league together and agree never to know any such thing one by the other

auxilium fero
gestus xxvi

to extend and offer out the right hand unto any is an expression of pity and of an intention to afford comfort and reliefe used also as a token of assurance peace security

and promised safety and salvation
an expression much desired by those who are in distresse and are not able to shift for themselves who use to call for the guift or auxiliary loan of this hand for thus palinurus calls to aeneas

da dextram misero tecum me tolle per undas

hence

dare manum alicui vel

manum admovere sign
opem auxilium ferre
symmachus calls this manum the helping hand

cassiodorus

dextram the comfortable hand and with isidor it is the witnesse of salvation

pierius makes this gesture the hieroglyphicke of fortitude and aid in which sense it is

very frequently used by the learned romans
the same manner of expression hath prevailed also with the greeks and with the hebrews likewise

for so saith the scripture the wicked lend one another the hand but in vaine for though hand ioyne in hand the wicked shall not scape unpunished
the like expression of gesture is frequent in sacred writ
the prophet

isaiah in reference to the signification of comfort saith they shall not stretch out the hands for them in the morning to comfort them for the dead and salomon speaking of the

vertuous woman saith she spreadeth out her hands to the poore and putteth forth her hand to the needy
to this intent jesus immediately stretched forth his hand and caught

up sinking peter crying out unto him to save him
and so significant and demonstrative to succour and support is this gesture that uzza for putting forth his hand to stay the arke of god was smitten with death for that speaking errour

of his hand
this gesture of succour and reliefe

hath been observed in ancient coines stamped

with the image of the goddesse ops by that posture promising a willingnes to helpe all that invoke her name
this gesture is also a naturall token of assurance and promised safety

thus the king of persia saved mentors life by reaching him his right hand
ammianus marcellinus saith the same of one nebridius who was the only man that refused to conspire with others against constantins and

therefore to save himselfe from the fury of the souldiers who had drawne their swords upon him flying with all speed he could make to julian besought him that for assurance he would vouchsafe to give him his right hand whereunto julian made answer what shall keep especially for my friends in case thou touch my hand but goe thy wayes from hence whither thou wilt in safety and security

commisereor
gestus xxvii

to let down the hand with intent to reare some languishing creature from off the ground is a greater expression of pity and commiseration then to afford a stretched out hand to one who riseth of his owne accord for between these expressions the learned have made a distinction to this expression finde that of the psalmist referred send downe thy

hand from above

irascor
gestus xxviii

to strike a table or some such like thing with the hand is the gesture of one angry or grieved in minde and very impatient
to which gesture that of the prophet ezekiel

is referred thus saith the lord god smite

with thine hand by this signe inciting the prophet to signifie the great wrath and destruction to come
the natural reason of which gesture is the minde fretted that it cannot meet with a revenge doth out of hand endeavour to

quench her fervent heat some other way to wit by strokes or noise or some other remedy which somewhat ease the minde
to descend downe into our owne historie for an example of this patheticall motion of the hand a royall copie whereof we have in a prince whose passions were as himselfe great to wit henry the

eight who demanding of one of his physicians whose patient cardinall woolsey was what distemper woolsey had who then was sicke the doctor replyed what disease soever he hath hee will not live to the end of three dayes more
the king striking the table with his hand cryed out had rather lose two thousand pounds then hee should dye make haste therefore you and as many physicians as are about the court and by all meanes endeavour his recovery
another example of this expression finde in our chronicles before the times of this

prince and that is in the duke of gloster protectour to young king edward the fifth
for among other passionate gestures which accompanied his changed countenance when he accused the queene mother and her complices of plotting his death and my lord hastings had adventur'd to returne some answer to his fierce interrogatory submissively saying if the queene have word was no sooner out of the lord hastings mouth when the protectour clapping his hand upon the

board and frowningly looking upon him said tellest thou me of if and and tell thee they and none but they have done it and thou thy self art partaker of the villany

cohorto
gestus xxix

to hold up the hand hollow above the shoulder points and to shake it in orbe by the turne and returne of the wrest is their naturall expression who encourage embolden and exhort one to be of good chéere
antonius in stead of speech significantly

used this gesture
for it is written of him that while he was setting his men in order of battaile at actium being resolved for a navall fight to end the controversie betweene octavius caesar and him for the monarchie of the world there was a captaine and a valiant man that had served antonius in many battailes and conflicts and had all his body hacked and cut who as antonius passed by him cryed out unto him and said noble emperour how commeth it to passe that you trust in these vile brittle ships what doe you mistrust these wounds of mine and this sword let the aegyptians and the phoenicians fight by sea and set us on the main land where we use to conquer and to bee slaine on our feet
antonius passed by him and said never a word but only beckond to him with his hand and head as though he willed him to be of good courage although indeed he had no great courage himselfe

praeclara agg+edior
gestus xxx

to exalt or lift up the stretch'd out hand is the habit of one attempting to doe and take some famous exploit in hand

and is a naturall posture of an exalted and victorious power
hence he is said to have his right hand exalted who is made powerfull and glorious
hence the prophet micha thy

hand shall be lift up upon thine adversaries that is thou shalt overcome and be victorious
and to this gesture the psalmist alludes thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries

wee reade in deuteronomy that the lord would have scattered his people but hee feared their enemies should wax proud and say our high hand and not the lord hath done all this
and that mirrour of patience the high arme of the wicked shall be broken
the psalmist

using the expression and signification of this gesture in great attempts arise lord lift up thine hand
and againe thou hast a mighty arme strong is thy hand and high is thy right hand
and the scriptures generally under the metaphor of this gesture shadow

out the power of god manifested in the delivery of the children of israel out of aegypt who under this phrase is significantly said to have brought them out from thence openly and by maine force
that it is significant in their hands who goe about to set in hand a businesse to omit other confirmation appeares in pharaohs speech to joseph were he said unto him am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his

hand in aegypt
examples of this attempting gesture are not wanting in prophane histories
for the day on which the battaile of pharsalia was strucken caesar seeing crastinus in the morning as he came out of his tent asked him what

he thought of the successe of the battaile crastinus

stretching out his right hand unto him which was a mute omen hee should have the better hand of his enemies that day cryed out aloud caesar thine is the victorie and this day shalt thou commend mee alive or dead and accordingly brake afterwards out of the rankes and running amongst the midst of his enemies with many that followed him made a great slaughter at last one ran him into the mouth that the swords point came out at his neck and so slew him

profero
gestus xxxi

to present the hand is their expression who profer or deliver a thing as their act and déed
and the verbe profero which hath the signification to profer and present a thing seemes to imply the very gesture
this was the first expression that ere appeared in the hand and was used by eve in the fatall profer of the forbidden fruit unto the first man
and it was required in

the old law at the hand of the offerer who was to present his offering with his owne hand for in religious duties there was never a proxie allowed as it is significant in delivery of writings as our act and deed it is most apparantly seene in its signification at the delivery of deeds so called from this gesture for this is that which gives force to all legall conveyances and without this expression liverie and seisin is of none effect
a semblance of the same gesture wee use when wee would take or accept what is profered and delivered into our hands
and that similitude of posture seemes to imply a correspondency and a favourable inclination to entertaine their offer as if they there withall profered thanks

for the same
to the naturall purpose and meaning

of this gesture the sonne of sirach he hath set fire water before thee stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt that is take or accept of which thou wilt for by a metonymy of the adjunct the signe is put for the thing signified
this was the second gesture of

any signification that is recorded to have appeared in the hand and the first that shewed it selfe in the hand of the first man adam when hee accepted of that forbidden fruit with which hee tooke a curse that filled his hand with labour and forced it often to advance to wipe his sweating browes
from this unhappy gesture the hand may be well called manus manando because all evill proceeded from this action
two uses the hand was chiefly ordained for to take and doe as galen well observes but man took

so ill with it at first that he undid himselfe
the misguided hand would be reaching at the tree of knowledge but prohibited by an expresse caveat was prevented from putting forth it selfe

to the tree of life

effoeminate festino
gestus xxxii

to wag the hand in a swinging gesture is their naturall expression who would to hasten and assist themselves in progressive motion and withall denotes a kinde of wantonnesse and effeminacy
aristotle sayes that

man could not walke unlesse he were assisted by the motion of his shoulders and that the swinging of his armes doth much help the bodies transportation in leaping which men by instinct knowing doe many times fall into this gesture upon such occasion
hence phisiognomicall

philosephers who know that every man hath his peculiar genius causing that native difference of habilities in men observing the operation of these spirits as they are matched and conjoyned to outward gestures which by a kind of tacit character give out the manner of their complexion doe easily discerne the differences of spirits by arguing syllogistically from the naturall habit to the genuine or contracted which custome makes more personall for as mens present passions and inclinations are brought by nature into act so men following the vogue of nature are wrought to a reiteration of that action untill the hand hath contracted a habit
←the result of these phisiognomers falls thus into a grand axiome of their art that whosoever is as by a personall propriety and actuall condition customarily seen to use the gesture of any naturall affection he is by habituall complexion very incident to that affection exhibited by that gesture
hence seneca not unskilfull in this art of chiromanticall phisiognomie makes the customary wagging of the hand to and fro a personall character of effeminacie and impudence
impudicum incessus

manus relatus ad caput digitus flexus oculorum the gate the turning of the eye the finger on the head and the wagging of the hand shew a shamelesse wanton
and marcus cato was wont to say

he would not have him for a souldier that wagd his hand as he goeth removes his feet as he fighteth and routeth and snorteth louder in his sleep then when he crieth out to charge upon his enemy

demo~stro non habere
gestus xxxiii

to shake out the hand is their naturall expression who would shew that they have not nor desire to have a thing
this the latines call manus excutere
the prophet isaiah in reference to the signification of this gesture saith the righteous shaketh his hands from holding of bribes

and the sonne of sirach alludes to the signification of this gesture where he saith the slothfull man is compared to the filth of a dunghill every man that takes it up will

shake his hand

castigo
gestus xxxiv

to shake or hold the stretched and raised hand over any is their expression who offer to chastise and thew a willingnes to strike or take revenge
hence the prohibition of the angel to abraham about to sacrifice his son after he had stretched out his hand to that intent lay not thine hand upon the childe
the prophet isaiah respective to this signification of gesture saith that the king of

assyria should shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of sion
and because men are wont to use this expression by gesture to those they hold worthy of rebuke and punishment that being terrified thereby they might reclaim them from vice
hence by an anthropopeia in many places of scripture this gesture implies the chastizing hand of god
to this signification belongs that of the prophet isaiah in

that day shall aegypt be like unto women and it shall be afraid and feare because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of hosts which he shaketh over it
to this also belongs

that of the same prophet with his mighty wind

shall he shake his hand over the river
and the prophet zechariah to the same signification behold will shake mine hand upon

them

pugno
gestus xxxv

to strike one with the fist is their gesture who would be avenged of those that have offended them and would right themselves by this wilde vindictive justice of their hands
the hand thus closely shut and the fingers all turned in is called in latine pugnus quoniam manus quae ante erat passa mane unde manus contracta clausis digitis effecta est undefined span alphabet id est

densae
the nether part of this hand in this posture chiromancers call the pomell or percussion of the hand the greeks seu ferieus manus and undefined span alphabet percutere


observes that the outside of the hand was deprived

of flesh that the fist might be more confirmed to supply the place of a weapon
and indeed they naturally and easily finde this thicke weapon who would buffet or fight at fisticusses with others
this was the gesture of the hand that first begun the fray or skirmish in the world before time had brought in the use of other weapons
hence the latines say pugnam

in manu esse and pugna hath its denomination from this posture of the hand
lucretius alludes to this primitive expression of anger

arma manus ungues dentes{que fuerunt

and when we see men together by the ears we know what they intend thereby
the prophet isaiah condemning the injurious use of this smiting

expression of the hand in and debate

calls it the fist of wickednesse

reprchendo
gestus xxxvi

to box or smite one with the palm of the hand is their expression who would rebuke or correct another for some saucie speech or action
hence the hand with the fingers stretched out which isidor calls the palme hath its name in hippocrates from a word that signifieth to strike
agellius useth the word depalmare for this smiting expression of the palme the greeks to the same signification of gesture use the word undefined span alphabet
this contemptuous expression of anger the officer of the high priest

used to our blessed saviour for the text saies he strooke him with the palme of his hand taking upon him to rebuke christ for answering the high priest irreverently as he cursedly supposed
to the naturall signification of this offensive gesture may that of the prophet isaiah be referred

therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still

apprehendo
gestus

to lay hand upon one is their expression who with authority apprehend and lay hold of one as a delinquent to secure their person
this is one of the properest expressions of the hand apprehension being the proper action of the hand for hand and hold are conjugates as they terme them in the schooles from which gesture the hand is called organon antilepticon

for it is the first use of the hand to take hold

with the ancients this gesture is manucaptio and manus injicere
this is a dangerous habeas corpus

in officers who are the hands of the law without words obtains the force of an arrest and hath a spice of their authority more strong then their emblematicall mace
these actions

are frequently entered in the counter of time
thus the officers of the high priest laid hands on christ and tooke him

manumitto
gestus xxxuiii

to let go ones hold and take off the hand from any one is their gesture who would signifie a willingnesse to release one that was before in their possession and power as having some reason to grant them their liberty
this with the ancients is manumittere and from the signification of this naturall gesture the ancients tooke their formes of manumission used when they did enfranchise their of which the civill law takes much

notice and the observation of critiques are very large in that matter
there is in this naturall expression of the hand a certaine forme of the thing signified
hence the aegyptian priests who alwayes had their eyes fixt upon the hand of nature in their hieroglyphique expressed liberty

by a hand extended out at large in which lively symbole of gesture the fingers seem to be made frée of the hand
the medall of tiberius claudius caesar in which a little graven

image hath the left hand opened to its uttermost extent with this inscription libertas augusta implies as much since the left hand the most retentive appears fréely to manumit for as the hand in this posture implies

the naturall liberty of its owne proper and individuall body so it most properly expresses the gift of the same priviledge to others by the same freedome of gesture

incito
gestus xxxix

to clap one on the back or shoulder with the hand is their expression who would hearten and encourage others a gesture obvious in the hand that takes part with those that are in fight and desires to set men or beasts together by the ears
significantly respective unto this is that gesture among others used

in installing the knights of st john of jerusalem whereby he that gives him laying his hand on his shoulder doth exhort him to be vigilant in the faith and to aspire unto true honour by couragious and laudable actions

foveo
gest
xl vve use to stroke them gently with our hand whom we make much of cherish humour or affectionately love an expression very obvious among the actions of common life being a kinde of indulgent declaration of the minde used to pacifie and please others performed by drawing our hand with a sweetning motion over the head or face of the party to whom we intend this insinuation
this the ancients call mulcere caput alterius a gesture often used by men in signe of favour and encouragement to ingenious and towardly youths

admoneo gest


to take hold gently of anothers hand is a gesture used by those who admonish

and perswade which hee that shall set himselfe to observe the actions of men may upon such occasions finde used to the same intents and purposes
mithropaustes used this gesture in admonishing demaratus the lacedemonian who

being in the court of persia the king willing him to aske what gift he would
hee besought the king to grant him this favour to licence him to goe up and downe the city of sardis with his royall hat on his head as the kings of persia do
for mithropaustes the kings cozen taking him by the hand said unto him demaratus the kings hat thou demandest and if it were on thy head it would cover but little wit
nay though jupiter should give thee his lightning in thy hand yet that would not make thee jupiter
and we finde timon surnamed misanthropos as

who would say or the using this expression who meeting alcibiades with a great traine as he came one day from the councell and assembly of the city not passing by him nor giving him way as hee did to all other men but went straight to him and tooke him by the hand and said thou doest well my sonne con thee thanke that thou goest on and climbest up still for if ever thou be in authority woe be unto those that follow thee for they are utterly undone
such an intention of gesture but with more vehemency of expression the angels used to lot while he lingred in sodome

laying hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters to admonish and perswade them to a sudden departure from that accursed city

confido
gestus xlii

to lean upon anothers hand is their gesture who make a confiding use of the staffe of their age or affection an expression importing that they much rely upon their faith and friendship and often seene in the hand of great princes when for greater state and ease they goe supported in this wise
the signification of which countenance of majesty doth in effect shew that the nobleman on whose hand the king leaned was next and subordinate in authority to himself and that the waight of all the principall affaires of state did lye on his hands
thus in the booke of the kings of judah we reade of a prince the

same that mockt at the words of elisha when he foretold of the releefe of samaria on whose hand iohoram king of israel lean'd that is as the glosse upon our bibles hath it a prince to whom the king gave the charge oversight of things as doth more plainly appeare by the
verse of the same chapter
and the speech of naaman to elisha after hee had cured him of his leprosie

makes it more apparant onely herein let the lord be mercifull to thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship and leane upon my hand
where naaman craveth to bee pardoned of zeale without knowledge as junius saith it being no such

thing as should trouble his conscience to bow himselfe in an officious sort and civill duty to bend his body that his lord might leane upon his hand when he went into the temple of the idol rimmon to adore
thus libo drusus sustained by the hand of his brother entred into the senate house to answer to that enormity hee was

accused of who when hee saw tiberius a great way off he held up his hands imploring mercy with great humility
which statelinesse of gesture was much used in asia by great persons and is at this day by your italian ladies

impedio
gestus xliii

to hold fast anothers hand in the signification of hindrance and restraint is a gesture so obvious in the cholericke perturbations of humane life that it needs no illustration by example since we may every day meet with satisfaction in the publique streets for in quarrells where there is any moderation or over mastering power on one side this restraint of the hand is used both with signification and advantage
to this gesture may be referred that of the prophet zechariah a great tumult from the lord

shall be among them and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour and judah also shall fight at jerusalem

recordo
gestus xliv

to iog one on the elbow is the usuall intimation of those who put others in minde and take upon them the part of a remembrancer a gesture very frequent in the common passage of humane affaires much practised by the hands of the ancient romane nomenclators as appeares by the testimony of horace

mercemur servum qui dictet nomina laevum

qui fodiat

recommendo
gestus


to take one by the hand in courtesie to recommend them unto another by way of presentation is an usuall expression in the hands of men a gesture significant and remarkable

having beene tooke notice of by ancient chronologers for the hand according to the primitive intention of nature having by a necessary consent of nations beene ever chosen chronologer of al remarkable actions hath consequently proved its own biographer
if therefore we but cast an intuitive eye upon those memorials the right hand of time hath left fairly noted in the left palme of antiquity even by the old autography of the hand wee may spell out the sense of this naturall expression
for when valentinian had a full purpose to adorne his sonne gratian a pretty young stripling and

well growne with the imperiall ensignes when he had wrought the souldiers to accept thereof hee ascended up the tribunall and taking the youth by the right hand hee brought him up before them and in a publique oration recommended him as ordained emperour to the armie
another copie of this naturall gesture we finde in the hand of pertinax refusing in modesty the empire pretending his age and meane descent

who taking glabrio by the hand and pulling him forth placed him in the imperiall throne recommending him as more fit for the empire
and commodus in a speech he made unto the souldiers of his army puts them in minde

how his father marcus when hee was an infant carried him in his armes and delivered him into their hands recommending him as it were to their tutelage and fidelity
thus also tiberius though with dissimulation tooke nero and drusus germanicus children by the hands and recommended

them to the care of the senate in a dissembling oration he made
thus cyrus taking

hystaspas by the right hand gave her unto his

friend gobrias who having stretched out his hand before received her at his hands
and this expression raguel used when he gave his daughter sarah to wife to young tobias an expression

which delivered from hand to hand is one of the solemne rites of matrimony to be used by the father of the bride

officiose duco
gestus xlvi

to lead one by the hand is their expression who take care of the weaknesse and inability of others in matters of progressive motion used most commonly to young children whom wee would teach and assist to goe with more ease and safety of which manuduction holy writ affords many examples
thus agar

by commandement of the angel held her childe by the hand which allegorically signifies the workes of the law that is the law commandeth workes
thus the tribune tooke the nephew of saint paul by the hand
and to this

may be referred that of the prophet ezekiel thus saith the lord unto cyrus whose right hand have holden
and to the signification of this gesture appertains that of the prophet isaiah concerning

the misery of jerusalem there is none to guide her among all the sonnes whom she hath brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sonnes that shee hath brought up
this sense of gesture hath that also of the author to the hebrewes in the

day when took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of aegypt
the like

phrase of gesture occurres in divers other places of scripture
but when this expression is used to

a female and one of riper yeares tis significant to present an officious and tender respect or serviceable affection
the aspiring affectation of women raised by choppines to an artificiall elevation of stature hath made this courtly garb of gesture more necessary and commodious to great ladies and hath preferr'd it to bee one of the eight parts of speech of a accidence
hence ovid a man well versed in such

obsequious expressions makes jupiter at his arrivall into crete lead europa by the hand into the cave of dicte
this expression is sometimes used to the blinde for the hand as it speaks by signes unto the dumb so in a more necessary garbe of speech it officiates the place of an eye and speaking in the conducting dialect of a friendly assistance supplyes the defect of an ocular direction
samson when the philistines had

boared out his eyes was beholden to the lad that held him by the hand for the last atchievement of his fatall strength
and in this sense the blind man and his leader are a kind of relatives

impatientia prodo
gestus xlvii

to apply the hand passionately unto the head is a signe of anguish sorrow griefe impatiencie and lamentation used also by those who accuse or justifie themselves
the recourse and offer of nature in this relieving expression of the hand makes good the adage ubi dolor ibi digitus
the prophet jeremiah prophesying

against judah foretels that she should be brought to use this note or signe of lamentation
and tamar defloured by her brother

ammon laid her hand upon her head

as it were accusing or justifying her selfe as lorinus

and tis probable that the shunamites childe when he cryed my head my head made use of this dolorous expression of the hand
thales by a pretty pageant put solon into such a passion by making him beleeve his sonne was dead at athens that like a mad man he straight beganne to beat his head like one impatient in affliction and overcome with sorrow
the head is the naturall hieroglyphique of health and the hand of reliefe and protection as being the champion of the head
hence in the straits of imminent perils or dolorous calamity they usually meet in a committee of safety
hence tiberius gracchus engaged in extreame danger as it were justifying himselfe and recommending his life and safety which depended on his head to the people

of rome laying his hand upon his head went forward to the capitoll which by the sinister interpretation of his enemies turned to his prejudice they inferring that by this signe he craved the diadem
some such passage you shall finde in aristophanes where dicaepolis to this effect et si non vera profatus fuero

manu supra caput imposita quae{que universus approbet populus

sollicite cogito
gestus xlviii

torue or scratch the head with the hand is their naturall gesture who are in anguish or trouble of minde for commonly when we are in doubt and uncertaine what to doe we musing scratch our head
hence by a proverbiall translation from this gesture caput fricare seu digito scalpere is used pro cogitare

but why we should in earnest meditation so naturally

expresse our endeavour by this recourse of the hand to the head to scratch where it doth not itch is may be to rowze up our distracted intellect or else the hand which is the engineere of invention and wits true palladium having a naturall procacity to bee acquainted with their phansie officiously offers it selfe to facilitate the dispatch of any affaires that perplex a faculty so neer ally'd unto it the hand in the collaterall line of nature being couzen germane to the fancie

pudeo
gestus xlix

the recourse of the hand to the face in shame is a naturall expression as alexander aphrodisaeus proves

for shame being a passion that is loath to see or be seene the bloud is sent up from the breast by nature as a mask or veile to hide the labouring face and the applying of the hands upon the face is done in imitation of the modest act of nature
hence licentius a noble young man writing to austin a learned and sweet poem very cunningly alludes to this naturall expression

et mea calliope quamvis te cominus altum

horreat

vultus

this declaration of shame by the hand we finde marke antony to have used after the battaile of actium fought betweene him and octavius caesar

for he flying with a doting speed after cleopatra who was fled before having overtaken her and being pluckt up into her gally at his first comming saw her not but being ashamed and cast downe with his adverse fortune went and sate downe alone in the prowe of the ship and said never a word clapping his head

between both his hands
and this expression is not onely used in respect of our selves but of others also as daily experience and the actions of men doe declare
for when there were divers oratours of greece very fluent and elegant speakers sent ambassadours unto philip and demosthenes had not spoken sufficiently for the honour of the commonwealth if there bee any credit to bee given to aeschines his enemy putting it downe in one of his orations adjecit ille etiam maxime ridenda quarum collegas ita ut

faciem obtegerent
the same aeschines in another oration where he describes the impudent audacity of a most notorious wicked man who would speake openly in a publique assembly of the citizens naked such saith hee was the beastlinesse of that petulant and drunken man that wise men put their hands before their eyes blushing in the behalfe of the commonwealth which used such counsellours

adoro
gest


to kisse the hand is their obsequious expression who would adore give respect by the courtly solemnity of a salutation or valediction
the gracefull carriage of the hand in this officious obedience to the will while it moves to the chiefest orifice of the minde
tertullian and others have acknowledged to have the handsome sense of a civill complement
to whom lucian consents
qui adorant saith st hierom solent manum

deosculari
and in the phrase of plautus this is adorare suaviter
there is no expression of the hand more frequent in the formalities of civill conversation and he is a novice in the court of nature who doth not

understand a basiér de la main and he a clown in humanity who doth not speake to his betters in this respectfull language of the hand

distante amicum revereor
gest
li

to bring the hand to our mouth and having kissed it to throw it from us is their expression who would present their service love and respect to any that are distant from them
a gesture have often observed to have beene used by many at publique shewes to their friends when their standings have beene remote from them
tacitus calls this

jacere oscula
dion

oscula per digitos mittere
otho who omitted no servile crowching for an empire after this manner threw his kisses abroad and herein shew'd himselfe his crafts master for hee had not often cast out this bait of courtesie but the people bit at it and swallowed this popular libation of the hand
and when the tide was once turn'd the senators contending and shouldering who should get first defaced galbas image extolled the souldiers judgement kissing otho's hand and the lesse they meant it in heart doing so much the more in outward appearance

conscienter affirmo
gest
lii

to lay the hand open to our heart using a kinde of bowing gesture is a garb wherein we affirm a thing swear or call god to witnesse a truth and so we seem as if we would openly exhibit unto sense the testimony of our conscience or take a tacite oath putting in security that no mentall reservation doth basely divorce our words and meaning but that all is truth that we now protest unto
this expression hath been most observed in the ancient grecians

as chrysippus saith who from this naturall expression of the hand concludes the lodging of the soule to be about the heart
the turkes at this day are observed most frequently to use this naturall forme of protesting with whom the hand spread upon the breast is accounted equivalent to the most solemne oath insomuch as whatsoever they speake or promise using this gesture may be beleeved as ingeniously spoken and the accomplishment of that promise to be presumed of
if we would see this forme of sincere in practise our owne histories afford us many examples
for the forme that hath been and is used at this day in judiciary trialls arraignments of noble men who are tried by their peers is that when the lord steward or clarke of the crowne asketh the peers whether the noble man there arraigned be guilty or not every one of them ceremoniously by his hand to his breast affirms upon his honor and conscience he is or is not guilty according as they find him
the particularizing of the examples purposely omit as unwilling to offend any noble personages who love not to heare of the tainted bloud of their ancestours

poenitentia ostendo
gest


to beat and knock the hand upon the breast is a naturall expression of the hand used in sorrow contrition repentance shame and in reprehending our selves or when any thing is irksome unto us because the breast is the cabin of the heart and this naturall procacity of the hand to this gesture doth manifest the heart to be the seat of affections
this naturall ceremony is exemplified in sacred writ for

this was the penitentiall expression that the publican used who went up to the temple to

pray
thus also the people who were witnesses of our saviours sufferings and the wonders that followed thereupon beholding the things that were done smote their breasts and returned
this habit of the hand is much practised

by the zelots in the roman superstition as a penitentiary expression most patheticall who are wont also mysteriously to mince this naturall expression and ceremoniously sometimes with two or three fingers only lightly to strike upon their breast and mouth a thing usuall with the ancient ethniques of old
and in ancient times in testifying griefe mourning and at funeralls as a solemne kinde of behaviour they used

this expression whom plutarch calls undefined span alphabet
so in cornelius tacitus incendebat haec fletum

pectus at{que os manibus verberans
and the acute epigrammatist describing the corporall adjuncts of sorrow and mourning

quod fronte selium nubila vides rufe quod ambulator porticum terit serus lugubre quiddam quod tacit piger vultus quod pene terram tangit indecens nasus

et

dextra pectus pulsat vellit

non ille amici fata

gregory nyssen when he would paint out as it were in apt colours of expression an unusuall griefe of mind and as it were a certaine heat of anger he useth the phrase of this habit

pectus manibus verberare
touching the naturall intentions of the fist in this expression so customary and significant in sorrow and repentance the fathers very elegantly and declaratively

deliver their opinions thus we strike our breast with the hand as it were protesting against the

sins included in that mansion as cyprian or as if we would drive those evill cogitations from our heart as hierome or to rouse up our heart
as theophylact or to appease the judge we take revenge upon our selves as chrysostome or to

chastise our flesh wherewith we have offended god as austin

dolorem noto
gest


to hold the hands upon the loins sides or hip is their expression who féel some paine in those regions of the body often seen in those which feel the pains of travell and in those who are troubled with hipocondriacall melancholy and the sciatica or hipgout
this demeanour of the hand is very declarative in the first sense as appeares in the prophesie of the prophet jeremiah demand now

and behold if man travell with childe wherefore doe behold every man with his hands upon his loines as a woman with travell and all faces turned into palenesse upon which place they who are curious may consult with ghislerius

indignatione timeo
gest
lv

the smiting of the hand upon the thigh in the practise and conversation of common life was ever frequent and is so deeply imprinted in the maners of men that you shall in vaine perswade a man angry and inraged with griefe to contain his hand from this passion
seneca the philosopher attributes this expression of

the hand to anger where he saith quid opus femur ferire in griefe it is also significant as they

who are versed in homer doe well know when they meet with those places wherein he describes his heroes provoked to anger and dolour whom he calls undefined span alphabet
in the sacred oracles of the prophets we have this expression noted described for that holy prophet speaking of ephraim lamenting surely after was converted repented and after that was instructed

smote upon my thigh which gesture in that prophet hath the signification of repentance with others of anger dolour and indignation
in the same sense it appeares in the prophesie of the prophet ezechiel cry and howle son of man terrours by reason of the

sword shall be upon my people smite therefore upon thy thigh
tully indeed ascribes

it to mourning feminum capitis percussiones
the registers of common life histories are full of examples of this habit of the hand bearing the character of this sense
thus cyrus

in xenophon hearing of the death of abradatas smote his hand upon his thigh
and flaccus president of aegypt and syria bannished by caius the emperour when he arrived

at the island andros most miserably howling in his calamity smote his hands and thighes
fabius dictator when his generall of the cavaliere minutius had almost cast away himselfe and his army at the sight thereof is

said to have uttered his anger and dolour this way
and when pompey had received letters from rome advertising him what great matters the people had passed in his behalfe some say that at the receit of them in the presence

of his familiar freinds and they that were about

him rejoyced with him for congratulation he knit his brows and clapped on his thigh as though it grieved him to have such great offices and charge laid upon him one in the neck of another by this dissimulation cloaking his ambition
this gesture of the hand is significant also in fear admiration and amazement
hence plutarch relating the injuries that the pirates

whom pompey vanquished did the romans saies the greatest spite and mockery they used to the romans was this that when they had taken any of them and that he cried he was a citizen of rome and named his name then they made as though they had been amazed and afraid of that they had done for they clapped their hands on their thighs and fell downe on their knees before them praying him to forgive them

data fide promitto

to strike anothers palm is the habit and expression of those who plight their troth give a pledge of faith and fidelity promise offer truce confirme a league buy sell grant covenant bargaine give or take handsell engage themselves in suretiship refer their controversies to an arbiter put to comprimise or chuse an umpier engage themselves to be true and trusty warrant and assure
that this gesture hath the sense and signification of faith and a solemne promise is apparent by the frequent intimations of the roman poets who by this gesture doe often imply faith
thus the prince of

latine poesie in this of dido

dextra

and in that of anchises

dat dextram at{que animu presonti pignore firmat
ovid no way ignorant of any matter of manuall expression brings in pandion taking his leave of tereus and his daughter philomol demanding this pledge and pawn of faith

and that lofty tragedian brings in licus suing for marriage with megara saying

animos fidei hoc pignus

martial according to the acute way of epigramatists

taking a hint from the peculiar property of the right hand in making promise brings in caesar in the whiske of one of his epigrams answering two petitioners at once by promising with both his hands

dum peteret pars haec myrinum pars illa triumphu pariter caesar utra{que manu

isidor saith this gesture is the witnesse of faith and trust
in faith saith pliny we put forth our

right hand or when we make a faithfull promise
the cynique in his symbole advising men

to adde benignity to their courtship covertly alludes to the propriety of this free expression

give not unto thy friend a clinched hand

and the symbole of pythagor as

doe not to every man extend thy hand

wills us not promiscuously to prostitute this friendly token of expression
to which that of lypsius may be referred vis dextram mei habes hic impressum etsi coram

ipsam dare jungere mihispes est cum aulam vestram videbo
when the hyrcanians of cyrus army expostulated with him in regard he seemed to

distrust them
cyrus in xenophon is said to have

answered him thus cogito nobis omnibus esse in anim is nostris at{que in nostris manibus
this expression of the hand the greeks very elegantly note in the word undefined span alphabet
the stoicks say faith is derived of the word facere to doe because all things that are faithfully promised ought to be performed most aptly therefore implied by the hand the symbole of action
and faith is strengthned by this expression of reaching out the right hand
how did cicero condole the violation of promise made by

this speaking paction of the hand dextrae qua fidei testes esse solebant perfidiae sunt scelere violatae
virgil for an expression of breach of promise symbolically useth the prevarication of this fallere dextram
and in this sense some take that of the prophet isaiaeh is there not a lie in my right hand and to this that of the

psalmist may be referred whose right hand is a right hand of falshood that is as the glosse on

our bibles hath it though they strike hands yet they keep not promise
caius ligarius used this expression of promising his aid assistance and concurence in any secret confederacy

with brutus who when brutus came to see him being sicke in his bed and said unto him ligarius in what a time art thou sicke ligarius rising up in his bed and taking him by the right hand said unto him brutus if thou hast any great enterprise in hand worthy of thy self am whole
gobrias in xenophon praiseth the right

hand of cyrus for what it promised it performed
and the danes swedes and norwegeans in whom the honest impressions of nature flow

from their hands pure and unmixt without any fucus of dissimulation or affectation of art doe most faithfully retaine the naturall sincerity of this expression of faith for of those northerne nations our learned barclay gives this commendation

they breake no promises when their hands are given
such religious observers of their manuall faith were the ancient medes and persians
hence plethon genistus

manus porrectio maxima inter persas censetur fides
wherefore cyrus in xenophon in an oration he made unto the medes saith hyrcanis quibus

dextras dedi servabo nunquam hoc deprechendar prodidisse
and xenophon relating an agreement between the persian and the grecian armies for a peaceable departure and safe conduct having recited the articles saith haec utrin{que sancita sunt

dextra datae vicissim
a royall example of this declaration of the hand we have in darius who after he was wounded by bessus and the other conspirators to the souldier of alexander who found him sore wounded in his litter but as yet alive recommending in a speech he made of his master touching his love and acknowledgement

of courtesie and that he dyed his debter in token whereof as a kingly pledge of his faith he gave the souldier his right hand to carry unto alexander and these words being uttered having stretcred out his hand hee gave up the ghost
florus josephus

proves this expression of the hand to have been in very great force and virtue among the ancients
artabanus saith he king of the parthians stretching out his right hand swore

to anilaeus the jew that his brother asinaeus might have safe accesse unto him which with the barbarians about to assemble is a most certaine argument of trust
for after the right hand given with them it is neither lawfull to deceive or difficult all suspitions and diffidence ceasing
wherefore when he was moved by the master of his horse that he might kill asinaeus he denyed to permit that against a man who had committed himselfe to his faith connied by giving the right hand with an oath
to this expression that passage also of the romane history may be referred where flavius cometh

to the romane generall gracchus enforming him that hee had begunne an enterprise of great consequence for the accomplishing and full perfecting whereof hee needed the helping hand of gracchus himselfe namely that he had perswaded all the fretors and governours who in that universall trouble of italy had revolted to annibal to returne into the league and friendship of the romanes by many arguments have used to them
thus and thus were my words unto them and indeed but my words mary they had liever heare gracchus himselfe speake and heare the same from his owne mouth they would more gladly talke with him in person and take holdof his right hand which as the assured pawne of his faithfull promise he carryeth alwayes with him wheresoever he goeth and they desire no more
this may bee further illustrated by another passage of livic where syphax

king of numidia having contracted a new alliance with the africans by marrying sophonisva the daughter of asdrubal allured by the faire

words of his new spouse sent into sicily to scipio to advise him not to passe over into africke nor rely upon any confidence of him or build upon his former promises
scipio in his letters which he dispatched by the same ambassadours requested him earnestly to be advised and bethink himselfe that he breake not the rights either of friendship or hospitable league with him or the league and society entred with the people of rome nor violate justice and faithfull promise made by giving right hands nor yet beguile and abuse the gods the witnesses and judges of all covenants and agreements made
isidore saith the surety of peace is given with the hand
and indeed all leagues truces and compacts are confirmed by this gesture of the hand
thus the league betweene antonius lepidus and caesar was established at confluents betweene perusia and bononia they ioyne hands and their armies embrace

which league they symbolically expressed by three right hands embracing each other with this motto salus generis humani a strange impresse to gull the world with and to cloake their ambitious confederacy
the king of persia commanded

his ambassadours to make this expression in his name
and in the same manner the ancient emperours and kings of germany were wont to send their great men to conclude a peace and determine affaires when they could not goe themselves
apollophanes cyzicenus who had in former times beene bound to pharnabazus by the lawes of hospitality and was a guest at that

time with agesilaus promised him to bring pharnabazus to a parly for confirmation of a

peace which agesilaus hearing of consented so he having received faithfull promise of safe conduct and the right hand being given brought pharnabazus into the appointed place where having saluted one another pharnubazus first of all put forth his right hand to which agesilaus also ioyn'd his
of this language of assurance expressed by the given hand there called dextra securitatis
the bookes of the macchabees are very pregnant
thus when the
thousand souldiers that jonathan had sent to demetrius to antiochia at his

request when the citizens saw that the jewes had gotten the upper hand and they were disappointed of their purpose of staying their king made their supplication unto the king saying give us the right hand or grant us peace
thus they of gaza made supplication unto ionathan and he gave them the right

hand or made peace with them when simon had besieged and fought against it a long season and shut it up at last they desired right hands to be given them to whom giving the right hand that is they desired peace which he granted

when simon had besieged gaza the people of that city cried with a loud voice beseeching simon to give them right hands that is to grant them peace
so they in the castle at jerusalem besought simon that he would ioyne right hands which he gave them or make peace with them which he did
thus andronicus

comming to onias who had fled to the sanctuary at daphne hard by antiochia counselled him craftily giving him his right hand

with an oath by that faire show of peace perswaded him to come out whom incontinently without any regard of righteousnesse he slew according to meuelaus instigation
so the nomades

of arabia being overcome besought judas a right hand to be given them which iudas giving them thereupon they hands and so departed to their tents
and thus antiochus eupater communed with the men in

and gave and tooke the right hand or tooke truce with them
the speech of reuben to his father jacob about benjamins delivering into his hands hath reference to

this signification of trust
and that speech of judah unto his father about the same busines will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require

him
in the sense of fidelity all the princes men of power and all the sons of david gave the hand unto king salomon
and the prophet

ezekiel emphatically declaring the perjury and infidelity of the king of jerusalem who had

broken the oath made with the king of babel which he had confirmed by giving his hand denounceth these punishments that he should dye in the midst of babel in the place of the king that had made him king whose oath hee had despised and whose covenant made with him he brake neither should pharaoh king of aegypt in whom he trusted deliver him
for hee hath despised the oath and broken the covenant yet loe he had given his hand and verily all nations have ever had a naturall respect unto the mystery of faith which hath her firme existence in the hand and have so esteemed the right hand they thought the

touch thereof to be the most lively significant and expresse pawne or pledge of faithfulnesse whence all compacts leagues grants combinations truces proviso's bargaines covenants and entercourses whatsoever are held to be inviolably ratified and to stand in full power force and virtue by the touch of the insuring hand
for when we give our hand we doe as it were an obligation or reall contract by which presents we deeply ingage our selves to a punctuall accomplishment of that which our hand had protested to the hand being bound as a surety that our deeds shall bee and be found answerable to our words for whosoever forfeits the recognizance of his hand he breaks the most sacred and strongest band of of truth and by falsifying his manuall faith proves a kinde of renegado to himselfe
caelius rhodiginus thinkes there is some pythagoricall

mystery in this authenticke guise of the hand in warrantizing faithfull dealings and that the gesture flowes from a secret and religious reverence to that comprehensive number ten for while each hand doth extend five fingers which move to the comprehension of each other they premit a resemblance of the decades mystery since meeting in their formall close they seem to greet one another in that number
callymachus and varro endeavour to render another reason

drawne from the naturall authority and command that consists in the virtue of the right hand
and verily faith consists wholly in the right hand and the left hath no obligatory force or virtue in it
for to give the left hand or to take anothers given right hand with the

left is not binding in point of naturall faith
and therefore when josippus gorio the jew desired a roman souldier to give him his right

hand in signe of faith he gave him his left and drawing his sword with his right hand slew him and yet he cannot properly be said to have falsified his promise since he gave him but his left hand whose touch hath no assurance but was ever held deceitfull and ominous
therefore the oath of faith in all adjurations was taken and required by the right hand
hence plautus haec per dextram tuam dextrate retinente manu

obsecro infidelior mihi ne sis quam ego sum tibi
to which may be referred that adjuration of cicero per dextram ipsam quam hospes hospiti porrexisti

for the ancients were wont by this gesture of faith to put their last will and commandement into the obliged hand of their heirs or executors
to which intent masinissa sent to manilius proconsull of africa requesting him to send unto him then at the point of death scipio

aemilianus who then served under his command as a souldier supposing his death to prove more happy if he dyed embracing his right hand and adjured him thereby to performe his last wil and testament
tarquinius priscus sent for servius to this purpose
thus the friends of germanicus

touching his right hand swore to revenge his death
and micipsa king of numidia after he

had adopted jugurth upon his used these words unto him adjure thee by this right hand which he held and by the allegigiance thou owest to thy country that thou estrange

not thy love and service from these thy kinsmen whom by favour and adoption have

created thy brethren
to this virgil alluding to

the generall custome

fata per aeneae juro dextram{que potentem

tibullus alludes to this gesture

te teneam moriens deficiente manu

the wilde irish doe ordinarily use to sweare by this seat of faith and minister of virtue the right hand who at every third word are wont to lash out an oath and among the rest these by my

god fathers hand by my gossips hand or by thy hand and for the performance of promise and that a man may beleeve them these are of greatest weight to binde them if one sweare by the hand of an earle or of his owne lord or some mighty person for if he be forsworne and convict of perjury the said mighty man will wring from him perforce a great summe of money and a number of cowes as if by that perjury the greatest abuse and injury that might be were offered to his name
and the hebridian scots

and mountainiers in their contracts sweare by the hand of their captaine an ordinance observed among them ever since evenus the first king that exacted the oath of faith at their hands
but the indissoluble soder and inviolable bond of society which old sincerity instructed by reason in the tacit force thereof thought the great oath and the strongest hold the hath to keep the honour of her estate is faith then which there was never any thing held to be of greater credit or antiquity
hence xenophon hath undefined span alphabet id est publicam fidem
and numa by his dedication of the hand to faith and commanding the flamins to execute

their functions with their hands covered

and wrapped close to their fingers ends gave a notable testimony that he held faith for holy and sacred after touching of the right hand that it ought be kept and preserved and that her seate was sacred and consecrated even upon the right hands and therefore that it ought by no meanes to be violated wherefore in particular contracts among the romans there was not any oath more religious and holy then the oath of faith a point of naturall doctrine that numa did but enforce with his rituall additions
but the authority reputation consequence and dignity of the publicke faith was had in such singular estimation that men held their money no

where so safe as in the hands of the publicke state
hence it is that we may see many ancient coines with two hands joyned together with this inscription of faith kept fides romanorum

sometimes fides legionum
and hence also it was that the romans were wont to contrive the statues of those princes that had deserved well of the that by a right hand extended out they signified their faith unto the same
tully had reference to this stateoath when he said gave publicke faith upon the promise of the senators that is to say he offered forth his right hand as a pledge thereof and it is fit this naturall ceremony of an oath should be reverenced in the hand the chiefest seat of fidelity since it is the honest foundation of all right and equity
nothing so ordinary in the common affaires of life as striking hands whether it be for confirmation of our bargaines grants or covenants in the behalfe of our selves or in undertaking by way of promise

and suretiship for others wherein the hand as a surety is still engaged
and indeed the whole trade of the universe is driven by this driving stroke of the hand he that shall as have sometimes done walke upon the royall exchange among merchants meerly to observe their courses of buying and selling shall soone be saisfied in the naturall force of this expression
but he that would see the vigour of this gesture in pur is naturalibus must repaire to the cirque or sheep in where those crafty olympique merchants who ed the hand of no broker to speed the course of their affaires will take you for no chapman lesse you strike them good lucke and smite them earnest in the palme
and have sometimes in consort with my friend had good sport to set him to observe the pure and naturall efforts of these men in the heat of their dealings and have suffered my selfe to bee a little smitten with the hand of deceit to gaine the curiosity of an experiment a kinde of solace pleasing to philosophicall complexions and such who hunt after the subtleties of nature wherein though cannot brag of my bargain yet can afford my reader a good penniworth
their cunning mannaging of the hand in time and tone have sometimes call'd the of smithfield which by calculation have found to differ from the fish dialect of billingsgate in the monochord of motion and peaceablenesse of accent
and he that shall undertake to markham and like hocus pacus to discover the subtleties of his own profession wil not set forth the art of well if he omit the rule of buying

and selling by this insurance and policy of the hand

but as concerning that perillous striking of the hand for others salomon who was well versed in the subtle notions of manuall utterance acknowledging the signification thereof in suretiship discommends the inconvenient and obligatory force of this expression my sonne if thou

be surety for thy friend if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger thou art snared
and in another place be not thou of those that strike

hands or of them that are sureties for debts
and the wiseman striking again with the same hand of reprehension a man void of understanding striketh hands and becommeth surety in the presence of his friend
wherein he checkes the indiscreet forwardnesse of some men in these kinde of undertakings who offer themselves before the favour is required at their hands and at the very sight of and presence of his friend without consideration

or looking into the businesse thrusts his hands into the bond of suretiship
and such a man is here describ'd to bee a man wanting a heart and surely it were well if such a one were without a hand also for since hee hath not understanding in his heart to keep him from hurt it were good he had no power in his hand to doe himselfe hurt especially if he be such a foole as having strucken anothers hand and made himselfe a surety he striketh his owne hands as applauding himselfe for it which may be the sense of this place
surely such a foole may quickly wring his hands together in sorrow who before did clap his hands in joy and may strike himselfe in anger with the same hand wherewith in

the foolish kindnesse of suretiship he strucke the hand of another
for he that hath strucken his hand to be surety for his friend had beene better that his friend had strucke him with a harder blow when by striking his hand he hath brought him under the hand of another and behinde hand in the world
salazar commenting upon these places of the proverbs renders this expression of

the hand according to expositors
variously sometimes tis manum desigere volam percutere in fidei jubentibus pro debitis manum pepigere in fidei jussionibus stipulata manu side jubere
and he calls it sometimes sonum securitatis vel assecurationis scil eum sonum quem in stipulationis fideijussionis seu assecurationis pacto manus manui conserta illisa edore solet
job also eloquent in affliction

in his appeale from men to god acknowledgeth the obligatory sense of this expression of the hand lay downe now put me in a surety with thee who is hee that will strike hands with me by tully this solemne bond or obligation of the hand is called nexus attici te

esse scribis mancipio nexu meum autem usu fructu
and in another place non enim ita dicunt eos esse servos ut sunt mancipia quae sunt dominorum facta nexu aut aliquo jure civili
hence in the lawes of the twelve tables we finde these words ut quae res mancipii essent qui eas venderet nexum faceret
to which may bee annexed that which valerius maximus reports of titus veturius

who as his words are propter domesticam ruinam grave as alienum plotio nexum se dare admodum adolescentulus coactus esset
this expression by gesture by reason of the signification it hath in nature was not onely used in testaments

in which the heyre was taken by the hand that hee might passe into the family of the testator and in the buying of servants but also in all obligatory bargaines and pledges as hottoman informes us and indeed in buying and selling this nexus was commonly used when

he that sold a commodity did undertake for the thing sold and did oblige himselfe to make goo whatsoever there lacked of the weight or ta of the commodity bought as the same hottoman affirmes which is as much as to undertake to be for the thing it self for suretiship is a species of bargaining
and according to varro a free man when he had enthralled himselfe to servitude for money borrowed untill hee had paid it hee was called nexus nector vel nexum quasi neo

sm clemens alexandrinus calls this carpismum because that he who did oblige himselfe unto another or offered his faith gave his wrest to wit the joynt whereby the hand is joyned to the wrest to be apprehended and wrung to signifie that he was held oblig'd custome having a little chang'd the most naturall forme without impeachment of signification

that this gesture is significant to licence warrant and assure is not difficult to prove
for thus artaxerxes king of persia by giving his right hand to mithridates the brother of

promising to kill datamen gave him licence and an open warrant with pardon of punishment to doe what he would in that businesse
and saint paul when he would warrant and assure the galatians corinthians colossians and thessal onians to whom he writ that those epistles were his his salutations in the close intimate that they

were witten with his owne hand
this gesture is also significantly used when we chuse an umpire put to arbitration and comprimise
to which that of job may be referred
neither

there any betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both
to which expression of gesture that also of the apostle saint paul seems

to appertaine
the law was given by angels in hand of a mediator as if that law of the old testament about keeping whereof the people of israel had covenanted with god had as by

giving the hand come to that people by mediation of moses and did prefigure what was to be done by the angel of the testament or mediator of a better testament to wit that a better

law established between god and man the mediator of the new covenant mediating between both the parties and stretching out his armes in his suffering had laid his hands upon them to confirme a more holy league and covenant

reconcilio
gestus lvii

to shake the given hand is an expression usuall in friendship peacefull love benevolence salutation entertainment and bidding welcome reconciliation congratulation giving thanks vnlediction and
this loving declaration of the hand the greeke expresse in the word undefined span alphabet
an expression usuall between those who desire to incorporate or grow into one and make a perfect joynt
the most happy point of amity a naturall forme very rich in signification since they who thus professe communion of while they willingly embrace each others hand signifie

that they are both content that their works shall be common by this gesture speaking plainly as if they in effect should say what damage happens unto thée shall esteeme as my owne losse and thy emolument and profit shall entertaine as mine owne and thou shalt finde me ready prest with a consonant and willing minde both to yéeld to thée a share of my welfare and reciprocally to beare a part of thy calamity
for all this is the more significantly implied by this gesture in regard that works are the words of love and the hand is the tongue of hearty goodwill
the minde of man naturally desirous by some symbole or sententious gesture to utter and disclose herselfe in the affections of love doth manifestly set forth her disposition by this courtly declaration of the hand a naturall complement where with she commonly sweetens her affectionate respects to others
and this naturall expression seems to result from the sympathy between the will and the hand for the will affectionately inclined and moved to stretch forth her selfe the hand that is moved by the same spirit willing to goe out and set a glosse upon the inward motion casts it selfe into a forme extending to a semblance of the inward appetite neither is the hand at any time found too short for such an expression if the will be disposed to cooperate with it
for nature who hath ingeniously thought on many conveniences of expression for the use and benefit of common life among others seems to have ordained the hand to be the generall instrument of the minde and endued it with a courteous appetite of closing with anothers
therefore when the minde

would disclose the virtue strength and forcible operation of her favour and out of the abundance of her love she puts forth the hand and in that as it were the heart it self with affectionate love and receives them againe by a naturall bill of exchange in the hand of another which verily is a signe of mutuall agréement and of a perfect conjunction for which cause pindarus a poet of an aspiring wit placed the heart

and hand as relatives under one and the same parallel
to the naturall sense of this gesture appertains divers passages of tacitus the lingones

saith he according to their accustomed manner had sent gifts to the legions right hands in token of mutuall love and hospitality
the centurion sisenna carried in the name of the syrian army to the souldiers of the guard right hands in token of concord
and ambassadours came from artabanus king of the parthians calling to minde their friendship and allyance with the romans and desiring to right hands
to bring this important gesture of the hand in friendship a little nearer to the authenticke light of sacred history
so john to jona

when he asked him whether his heart were right give me thine hand
so james and cephas and john gave to barnabas the right hand of fellowship that is they gave him their hands in token of agreement in matters of doctrine

that this gesture is significant in salutation bidding welcome and entertainment is apparent by many testimonies of the ancients
virgil in the first place witnesseth the same complaining

to his mother thus

dextrae jungere dextram

non

and in another place speaking to

concerning his affection to anchises

amare are virum conjungert

also concerning himselfe

arrit mihi tantum quid dulcissime rerum

to this signe of salutation and entertainment appertaines that medall whose inscription is traus adrianus wherein you may see the

emperour himselfe joyning his right hand with the hand of sitting with this inscription placed under the base adventus aug
we read of the second to have used this

expression of welcome to his nobles when they appeared at westminster
michans delivered this gesture as a certaine secret to his disciples that when they met one another they should salute by joyning hands by which signe they declared that they were delivered out of darknesse as reporteth
and there is no

expression of love more frequent in the entercourses of common life then this
thus in xenophon comes to cyrus and taking him by the right hand makes use of this gratefull expression and both xenophon and all other authors are full of such loving occurrences of the hand and mutuall declarations of hospitable love
thus pallas in virgil entertaining aeneas and bidding welcome

succede hospes

accepit{que manu dextra{que amplexus

thus tiridates king of armenia comming to corbulo lighted first from his horse and corbulo

did the like immediately and both of them on foot joyned right hands
and when cicero had fled out of rome for feare of antonius who after

the death of julius caesar began to looke aloft and became fearfull to all men as though he meant to make himselfe king but afterwards condemning his dastardly feare returned to rome there came such a number of people out to meet him that he could doe nothing but take them by the hands and embrace them who to honour him came to meet him at the gate of the city as also by the way to bring him to his house
this symbolicall expression of the hand had a practicall signification among the ancients when the hand given did assure the inviolable observation of all the lawes of hospitality which may receive some illustration from the noble practice of pacuvius calavius who when

he had invited annibal to supper and perolla his onely sonne after supper had told his father that he had now an opportunity to reconcile himselfe unto the romanes to let him seale it with the blood of annibal his father dehorting and conjuring him from the violation of the lawes of hospitality breach of covenant there are not many houres past since that we sware by all the gods and holy hollowes in heaven and by ioyning hand in hand made faithfull promise and obliged our selves to communicate together with him so to eat at the holy table of sacred viands
and when king syphax was brought into the praetorium or generals pavilion and

there presented unto scipio scipio was much moved in minde to consider the state and fortune of the man compared now to his present condition

which more wrought upon him when he remembred withall and called to minde the hospitable entertainment the giving interchangeably of the right hand and the covenant betweene them made both in publique and private
our ancestors also had this expression of hospitable love in a reall respect when they knew no greater terme of reproach then to call a man unhospitable
this expression of the hand continues in force and estimation and beares such sway among all nations especially those that are northward that he seemes to be disarmed of all humanity and to want the affability of expression who doth when there is occasion for it omit this benevolent insinuation of the hand
but concerning this familiar and naturall intimation of the hand in point of salutation the ancient sages and men of soundest judgement have made a quaere whether the familiar contact bee so comely and laudable in the hand of a prudent and religious man
among the wise masters those who were given to pleasure as socrates plato and others willingly

admit of this embracing of the hand as an allurement to uncleane desire
but those that affected gravity disallowed the promiscuous use thereof
verily the pythagoreans did give the right hand to none but men of their owne sect no not so much as to any of the same family unlesse to their parents as iamblicus notes
and it

appears by the most ancient observations of elder times that holy men for the most part used in their salutations only to put forth the hand since so the singular benevolence of a friendly minde may be expressed without any impeachment to

their virtue and gravity
meletius of antioch a man endued with an incredible easinesse and swéetnesse of manners and most deare to all good men is said only to have put forth his affable and gracious right hand in salutations to shew the force of his love and affection towards others wherein he observed the lawes of common humanity and a courteous disposition without any detriment to religious modesty
and at this day religious men in forreigne parts most commonly abstaine from embracing the hands of others without incurring the censure of incivility and want of grace in behaviour as taking the shaking of hands in this sense to be too blunt an expression for a hand accustomed to matters of decorum and the sacred tokens of divine reverence
in signe of congratulation the huntsmen at the fall of the boore slaine by meleager with cheerfull shouts unfolding their joyes shake his victorious hands as ovid elegantly feignes according to the naturall property of the hand on such occasions
nothing more ordinary then shaking of hands in valediction and taking leave of our friends and bidding them farewell of which poets and historians are not silent
ovid brings in cadmus at his transformation speaking to his wife hermione to

use this loving gesture of valediction and to shake hands with him while he yet had a hand to shake
thus calanus the indian philosopher

about to sacrifice himselfe alive at the tombe of cyrus before he went up upon the funerall pile he bad all the macedonians that were there farewell and shooke them by the hands
and telutias when hierax admirall of the lacedemonians

came in the interim that he was rescuing the aeginetes besieged by the athenians and tooke his ships from him yet he went home very happy for when about to depart he

tooke ship there was not a souldier but shook him by the hand and with other kinde expressions wishing all happinesse unto him
that this gesture is significant in reconciliation is most manifest by our common practise and use thereof in the sense of that intention
thus minutius and fabius maximus dictator gave their

hands one to another at the time of their reconciliation
and when onatius aurelius a knight of rome had told the people what a vision he had seen in his dream that jupiter had appeared to him that night and willed him to tell them openly that they should not put pompey and crassus out of their office before they were reconciled together he had no sooner spoken the words but the people commanded them to bee friends
pompey sat still and said never a word unto it
but crassus rose and took pompey

by the hand and turning him to the people told them aloud my lords of rome doe nothing unworthy of my selfe to séek pompeyes friendship and favour first since you your selves have called him the great before he had any haire upon his face and that you gave him the honour of triumph before he was a senator

injurias remitto
gestus lviii

to presse hard and wring anothers hand is a naturall insinuation of love duty reverence supplication peace and of forgivenesse of all injuries
hence physitians the subtile and diligent observers of nature

thinke that there is in the hand a certaine secret and hidden vertue and a convenient force or philtre to procure affection
wherefore themistius he who coupled eloquence with the gravity of philosophy where he disputes of reconciliation

and kniting together of hearts in the common bond of friendship he would have the hands of others to be laid hold on and wrung with the fingers for that saith he the hands put forth a sting or goad and are many times a convenient spur to future amity
hereupon beauties pale vassalls led by the forcible instinct of their passion in preferring their amorous insinuations doe much use this speaking touch of the hand a piece of covert courtship whereby they seem to strive to imprint upon their mistrisses hand a tacit hint of their affection suggested in this pressing flattery of the hand for lovers know not by what amorous instinct next to the face direct their passionate respects to the hand of those they love to this part they most usually accommodate their significant expressions this they devoutly wring and embrace and by the discoursing compressions thereof intimate and suggest the eagernesse of desire and their inexplicable apprehensions of joy griefe
hence the great master in the art of love understanding the naturall force of this tacit conference

and humble supplication brings in jason exhibiting his request to medaea softly wringing her fair hand

ut vero caepit{que loqui dextram{que prehendit hospes auxilium submissa voce rogavit

but this chirothripsia or griping anothers hand was never held a safe or warrantable expression

in the hand of any man taken for the most part for a wanton essay or sly proofe of a tractable disposition and a lascivious prologue and insinuation of lust

solent manus ipso contactu validae animae robur effoeminare a proofe and experiment of whose observation may be understood out of a certaine short narration of philostratus
there were in the stately seraglio of the king

of persia many of the kings concubines of excellent beauty who for their rare perfection of parts and outward endowments of nature might well have stood in competition for the golden ball of paris upon one of which when a certain eunuch had more curiously cast his eyes he began to be tickled with desire and so netled with the itch of concupiscence that he placed all his felicity in enjoying of her wherefore he made frequent visits carried himselfe very obsequiously unto her sprinkled his discourse with amorous and words and which he thought would most of all availe to set forward his designe and to stir up and quicken the flame of affection he wrung her hand which when the of the eunuchs perceived he commanded him especially in no wise to touch the neck or hand of the woman good counsell which when he refused to follow he fell into that foule action which proved fatall unto him
this gesture as it is a token of duty and reverentiall love coriolanus used towards his mother

volumnia when overcome by her earnest perswasions to withdraw his army from rome he

cried out oh mother what have you done to me for holding her hard by the right hand oh mother said he you have wonne a happy victory for your countrey but mortall and unhappy for your sonne for see my selfe vanquished by you alone
this wringing of anothers hand doth sometimes naturally imply peace and a loving forgivenesse of all injuries
and how faithfull an interpretor of the minde the hand hath continued even when the tongue hath failed and men have been deprived of all wayes of delivering their mindes but by signes and tokens and how intelligible this expression by gesture which we have now in hand hath been apprehended to be in the extremity of silence may sufficiently appeare by preferring the examples of two great princes lying both speechlesse on

their
the first example shall be in philip duke of burgundy the father of charles slaine at the battell of nancie charles having absented himselfe from his father for some faults and his father falling very sicke in the city of bruges so that his speech failed him charles hearing of it came from gant in post to bruges and falling on his knees before his father did with warme teares beg humble pardon for all the griefes he had put him to and besought him with lowly reverence that he would vouchsafe him his fatherly blessing his confessour having told him in his ear that if he could not speak he should at give his sonne some token and testimony of his good will towards him the good prince opened his eyes and taking his son by the right hand clasped it within his

owne so hard as he could a signe of love and forgivenes
to match this with another of our own history to wit of henry the eight who falling sick commanded the archbishop then at croyden

should be sent for in all haste who using all possible speed came not untill the king was speechlesse as soone as he came the king tooke by the hand the archbishop exhorting him to place all his hopes in gods mercies through christ beseeching him that if he could not in words he would by some signe or other testifie this his hope who then wringed the archbishops hand as hard as he could a signe of faith and hope of mercy and forgivenesse and shortly after departed

suspicionem odium noto gest


to draw backe the unwilling hand instead of reaching it out to imbrace the hand of another is a sign of enmity likely to prove inveterate used by those who flatly refuse to agrée reject that proffered amity which they have in suspition
the example of caius popilius may seem very

aptly to belong unto this gesture who when he had met antiochus foure miles distant from alexandria after greeting and salutation at the first comming antiochus put forth his right hand to popilius but he delivered unto him a scrole written and wished him before he did any thing to read that script after he had read the writing through he answered he would devise with his friends and consider what was best to be done
but popilius according to his ordinary blunt manner of speech which he had by nature

made a circle about the king with the rod he had in his hand and withall make me an answer quoth he advise you such as may report to the senate before you passe the compasse of this circle
the king astonied at this so rude and violent a commandement after he had stayed and paused a while will be content quoth he to doe whatsoever the senate shall ordaine then and not before popilius gave the king his hand as a friend and ally
the stoutnesse of sylla and his resolution to be reconciled upon no other tearmes then his own

discovered it selfe by the same neglectfull carriage of his hand towards mithridates who when he came to him and offered to take him by the hand sylla asked him first if he did accept of the peace with the conditions archelaus had agreed unto nor untill mithridates had made him answer that he did would he accept of his proffered and suspected amity for then and not before he resaluted embraced and kissed him

if we should looke backe up on the actions of affectionate lovers whose inflamed hearts have moved them to sacrifice kisses on this low altar of friendship and to offer their service by this modest insinuation of gesture we might finde many passages of historicall antiquity to confirme and illustrate the sense of this expression
how passionate was cyrus when he came to the place where his friend
abradatas lay slaine seeing his

wife sitting upon the ground by the dead body of her lord for bursting forth into this patheticall ejaculation thou good and faithfull soule art thou gone and left us and there withall tooke him by the right hand and the hand of his dead friend followed for it was cut off with the cymeter of an aegyptian which cyrus beholding it much aggravated his sorrow

delapsa coelo sidera hominibus si sese offerent amplius non recipient saith valerius
this token of love

for when quintius had vanquished king

philip and proclaimed liberty by the beadle to

many of the parts of griece as the corinthians phocensions and others there was such joy as men were not able to comprehend at last when their joy was once confirmed by making the beadle to cry it once againe they set up such a shout and followed it so with clapping of hands redoubling the same so often as evidently it appeared how there is no earthly good in the world more pleasing to a multitude then liberty is and afterwards running apace unto the roman generall in such sort that his person was in some danger of the multitude crouding so hard upon him alone to touch his right hand

many such apes of sovereignty our times afford who arrogate to themselves more honour then either their birth or fortunes can chalenge such may see a copy of their improper expression in marcellinus who describing the corrupt state of

rome in the dayes of valentinian and valens shews how the nobility some of them when they began to be saluted or greeted breast to breast turned their heads awry when they should have been kissed and bridling it like unto curst and fierce bulls offered unto their flattering favourites their knees or hands to kisse supposing that favour sufficient for them to live happily and be made for ever
indeed the favourites of fortune and great commanders of the world with a little more reason have thought them much to wrong their majesty who in kissing presumed above their hands
examples of which imperious expression we have in caligula who as dion reporteth of him was very sparing

great princes at this day expose not their right hand to be kissed but to such whom they would welcome with some especiall grace
for when great potentates intend to admit a friend into protection or in their royall goodnesse are pleased to some exile from their love and would dispense with greater majesty a pardon royall for some passed offence they use openly to offer and present the backe of their right hand permitting them by that favour to reverence their power and high command or the signification of that touch and honourable favour is as much as a firme signe of reconciliation and a gracious league obtained at their hand

and if it may be lawful to divine of the legality of this should thinke that there lyes some concealed symboll in the device and that the estates assembled had regard to the fellonious procacity and craft of this guilefull hand which is prone by a slie insinuation with more subtile secrecie to present it selfe to any sinister intention doth no sooner move to such actions but every finger proves a limetwig which the ancient aegyptians implied in their way of hieroglyphique when they figured furacity

or theft by a light fingured left hand put forth as it were by stealth
to open and unfold the subtile and occult conceptions of antiquity about the nature and disposition of the left hand and to collect what hath been noted touching the sinister inclinations of this hand whereby its naturall properties have propagated themselves and by action insensibly spread into the

manners and customes of men
first it is the noted property of the left hand to be coverd and to keep as it were a recluse in the bosome or to be carried wrapped up in a cloake lurking closely and lying as it were in ambuscado to entrap and by a crafty fetch imperceptibely to make a prize of all that comes to hand
whence the greeks from whom the facetiousnesse of manners and elegancie of learning as some thinke were first derived signifie as much who will therefore have the left hand named undefined span alphabet

lavam manum because for the most part undefined span alphabet tegi occultari soleat whereupon this hand being more idle for idlenesse is a maine cause of theft it is consequently more prone to this manuall transgression
this lightfingered hand being called by isidor laeva quod

aptior sit ad levandum to wit to beguile elude lessen and diminish anothers goods
and theocritus

following herein the opinion of antiquity having noted the particular quality and behaviour of this hand and the private vice to which it is propense concludes from the pitchy temper thereof that the left hand signifies the captivity of unlawfull desire and rapacity so that it hath for this cause been consecrated to laverna the goddesse of theeves as being by reason of its wily genius more fit and convenient for cousenage and clandestine theevery for being commonly hid and involved in the bosome of a gown or cloake and waiting in obscurity it comes to passe for the most part men suspecting no such thing that doing nothing and devoted to rest yet being at liberty and ready to handle it will be doing and somewhat of other mens suffers

for it while this purloining hand thinkes it selfe the proprietary of anothers goods
hence that elegant recorder of the ancient fictions with a poeticall touch of his pen sets a glosse upon this businesse thus

ad furta sinistrae

and that quaint comoedian long before him

pointing out as it were with his finger the genuine deceitfulnesse of this hand called it furtificam laevam the close and cunning pilferer and euphormio alluding to the same properties of this hand saith turgentes occulos furtiva manu

exfrico
and indeed laeva or sinistra according to the ancient manner of speaking used with the ancients notes one to be a thiefe

that subtill knave asinius who was experienced in the crafty handling of things and drawing them to his owne private advantage used this hand as least suspected when he had watched an opportunity at a feast to steale away some of the linnen against whom catullus in his stinging

stile slings these words out of his crisped pen

maruccine asini manu sinistra non belle uteris sed in ioco at{que vino tollis lintea negligentiorum

hence also when sophiclodisca the baud in plautus

upon suspition of felony demanded to see the hand of paeginum and the lad like a crafty wag had put forth his right hand she replied to him ubi illa altera furtisica laeva where is that other close and cunning pilferer the left hand
autolicus was expert in the slie feats of this hand of whom martial

non erat autolici tam piceata manus

and we read in catullus of porcius and socratio

duae sinistrae pisonis the two left hands of piso that is instruments of his by whose private conveyance he received bribes for although in regard of their imployments under him they might be said to be his right hands yet in this sense of bribery and close conveyance they were properly called his left hands
the aegyptians in hieroglyphique

painted justice by an open left hand as the colder weaker and slower hand and therefore lesse prone or able to apply it selfe to offer or doe any injury
but it is better for the that judges should be without hands as the theban statues of judges were

then in this sense to have a left hand

benedico
gestua lxiv

the imposition of the hand is a naturall gesture significantly used in condemnation absolution pardon and forgivenesse benediction adoption initiation confirmation consecration ordination sanation and in gracing our meales
that this gesture is of importance in condemnation is apparent by the commands of the old law in case of temptation to ethnicisme

and practicall idolatry
so when the sonne of shelomith the daughter of dibri of the tribe of dan which she had by an aegyptian had blasphemed the lord by the hand of moses

commanded him to be brought forth without the campe and all that heard him were to lay his hand on his head
and the laying of the hand on the sacrifices head that was condemned

in the offerers stead so often commanded in the leviticall law points to the signification of this gesture
in absolution pardon and forgivenesse notwithstanding the identity of gesture

there is a proper contrariety of expression and this seems to be a naturall and paraphrasticall gesture very sutable to that petition in the lords prayer forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them their trespasses against us
for as nature teacheth us to raise our hands to beg pardon and forgivenesse at the hand of god so she likewise moves us to the same expression of gesture as most proper and significant to seale our pardons to others implying that who forgives shall be forgiven and neither nature nor grace doth move us to aske pardon on any other terms
the phrase of this gesture is significantly tooke into the formes of the civill law and hath been practised in ecclesiasticall absolution
parisiensis for this reason would have it a sacrament because

it hath a sacring and sanctifying signe to wit a sign having a naturall resemblance with inward sanctification it self which is the hand
to this gesture as it is cunningly made an appenage to the papall policie of auricular confession have nothing to say only finde that the ancient form of absolution was to hold both the hands conjoyned

over the parties head which was to be absolved which may be also exhibited by one hand laid in sequence of the other or both conjoyned and held above the head so appearing in the aire without any residence at all upon the head
the manner of performance at this day it seems is to lay on both the extended hands upon the head so that they touch the crowne and rest and settle downe thereon
as this gesture is significant in benediction it was used by isaac upon his when he blessed his sonne jacob who supplanted esau of his blessing

by counterfeiting the rough hands of his elder brother and thus jacob about to dye blessed his twelve sonnes every one of them with a severall

blessing
our blessed saviour who with the sacred gestures of his hand hath sanctified the expressions of ours and made them a holy language was often seen to use this expression of the hand whence the church commenting upon his action saith he by his outward gesture

and deed declared his good will to little children in that he embraced them in his armes
laid his hands upon them and blessed them
and the very last expression that flowed from his sacred hand was blessing for at the time of his ascention he lifted up his hands and blessed his apostles and while

they beheld him in this posture blessing them he departed bodily from them ascending up into heaven
hence in all tacit posies of his ascention this figure of the sacred property of his hand is most emphatically significant
that in conferring the blessings of primogeniture and adoption this gesture of the right hand is more peculiarly significant is excellently illustrated by the adoption of ephraim unto the birthright of manasseth by jacob when he blessed joseph sons

for joseph bringing his sonnes to be blessed of his father tooke ephraim in his right hand towards israels left hand and manasses in his left hand towards israels right hand so he brought them unto him but israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on ephraims head which was the younger and his left hand upon manasses head directing his hands on purpose for manasses was the elder
but when joseph saw

that his father laid his right hand on the head of ephraim it displeased him and he staid his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head to manasses head
and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the eldest put thy right hand upon his head but his father refused and said know well my sonne know well he shall be also a people and shall be great likewise but his younger brother shall be greater then he and his seed shall be full of nations so he blessed them that day and said in thee israel shall blesse and say god make thee as ephraim and manasseth and he set ephraim before manasseth
for the historicall

sense of this expression see tiraquel and dr field
pererius rupertus and isidorus affirme that in a mysticall sense this cancelling or crossing of the patriarchs hands in exhibiting his blessing and transferring the right of primogeniture to the younger was representatively done to prefigure a mystery of the calling of the gentiles and the preferring of them before the jewes and that this was the first type or prefiguration of the manner of the promised messiahs passion in the decreed way of redemption
the same gesture we use in gracing our meals an expression very proper and significant for the hands reverently erected without any other forme of speech annexed seem naturally to pronounce this grace

thou supreame power the giver of all good things who openest with thy hand and fillest every living thing with thy blessings vouchsafe lord benedicendo benedicere to let thy

right hand blesse sanctifie and confirme unto us the blessings of thy left

and it is a brand of prophane unmannerlines in the rough hand of esau that he was readier to strike hand with a chapman to sell gods blessing for his meat then with his hand to invite it to his meate
whereas our blessed saviour thought blessing bid by this reverend invitation of the hand a considerable guest at a feast who to shew that man liveth not by bread only upon all such occasions used the signification of this gesture
thus he blessed the five loaves and

two fishes wherewith he wrought his feeding miracle
and from this chireulogia or act of blessing and giving thanks the sacrament used at his last supper is called the eucharist
and in the tearmes and stile of or naturall divines to speake to the fundamentall point of this gesture now in hand
the hands and blessing seem to be conjugates in the schoole both of nature and grace
benediction being a naturall rite neare allied unto the hand and of spirituall affinity with prayer
for religion and grace disa not the powers of naturall expressions but advance them to a full and purer perfection improving the corporeall sense of those manifestations to a more spirituall and sanctified signification
that inexhaustible fountaine therefore of blessing our blessed saviour having ordained himselfe a hand and having taken upon him the corporeall nature of man was constantly pleased to honour the nature he had so taken and to enforce by the precept and authority of his owne example the significant

convenience religious use and decent importance of this property of blessing annexed to the hand
in consecration this gesture hath the like congruity of signification for there was never any thing by the expresse command of any legislator to be hallowed by a dedication but the hand was called to and injoyned to attend as a proper addition to confirm and sanctifie all other rites not that there is any inherent holinesse in the hand or solemne forme of expression but an adherent only
the very heathens have acknowledged a significant vertue in this expression of the hand for we read that numa was

consecrated upon mount tarpeian by the chiefe of the southsayers called augures laying his right hand upon his head a piece of superstitious apishnesse they learned from the grand spirituall impostor
moses a man skilfull in all the learning of the aegyptians among which some secrets of our chirosophie were judiciously veyled by inspiration commanded the right hand of the high priest to wit the thumbe thereof or to be hallowed with the oyle in his left palme from thence called the holy finger

a forme also observed in the inauguration of kings
and the finger was used in all dippings and sprinklings of the leviticall law
the ground and foundation of this typicall expression

seems to be laid in nature for the hand is conceived to be as it were a shadow or image of the trinity for the arme that proceeds from the body doth represent the second person who proceeds from the eternall father who is as it were the body and spring of the trinity and the fingers which flow both from the body and

the arme doe represent the holy ghost who proceeds both from the father and the sonne
hence hierom upon the passage of isaiah to whom is the arme of the lord revealed saies that the arme of the lord is mystically the son

proceeding from the father to which some refer that of the psalmist he made strong his arme
and the arme shadowes out the second person in the trinity in these respects in coessentiality

with the body coevallity ability utility agility and flexibility
the fingers give an umbrage of the holy spirit in regard of their procession proceeding from the arm and hand operation the body working by the hand and fingers conjunction taction ostention aspertion

distinction of joynts equall numeration
hence the finger of god in scripture signifies the holy spirit if in the finger of god cast out divells but then the word finger must be

in the singular number for in the plurall it hath other senses
it is also their gesture who would solemnly confer some spirituall or temporall honour upon some person
this in the sacred language of scripture is chirothesia and is a matriculating gesture and the formall preposition proper to those who are to be openly installed or inaugurate in some new place of duty or of command all creations relying on the honorarie touch of the giving hand as the enduing ensigne that by evidence ensures the priviledges of investiture
and this manuall expression is so naturally important that it proves in honorarie initiations a fitter vestment to cloath the intention in then the airy texture of words for it hath ever had a sacred efficacy to move the understanding

by the sense and to facilitate the overture of sacred affaires as being of good note and consequence conducing and inviting to the knowledge of things abstruce there being no other part of man that can so lively and emphatically present by gesture the solemne images of intention since by the motion of the hand there is wrought in the minde of the beholder something that is ex significant unto a thought as that which suggests more unto the minde then what is expressed unto the outer sense for it hath more sollidity and weight then appeares in the bare relation and all gestures of the hand being known to be of their very nature signs of imitation the mystique property close intention of this gesture is not alone to represent it self but to conduct and insinuate something else into the thought which being as it must ever be an intelligible notion as it is a signe or token it falls short and abates of the perfection of the thing that is implied by its outward signification wherefore a hand is but improperly said to be the shadow of its counterfeit which is wrought by a pencill in imitation of the life although upon sight thereof we know and conclude it to have the semblance of a hand to be a draught or copy of the originall so this gesture is but a manuall vision of the mind most conformable to expresse divine notions which else would lose much of their lustre and remaine invisible to the conceit of man
this forme of expression in ordination as it is agreeable to the canon of nature so it hath received confirmation by the hand of god since it first appeared in the hand of the patriarchs the first

dispensers of personall benediction who used it to betoken the restrained intention of their votes unto them on whom they conferred their blessings for we finde moses by command

putting his hand upon joshua the sonne of nun to appoint him governour who is said to be full of the spirit for moses had laid

his hands upon him
and when moses and joshua had prayed and laid their hands on the seventy elders the holy spirit came upon them
in choosing of deacons this gesture

was used by the apostles
and in the separation of barnabas and saul to be the apostles of the gentiles this gesture is againe used
and timothy is put in minde by st paul of the gift

he received by this imposition of hands for not only the office but the ability were together conferred upon many by this gesture of which acquist we must not conceive the solemne gesture to be a naturall but a morall cause as being the true manner form of impetration god assenting and by successe crowning the prayers of religious hands and shewed that what they did was by prayer and blessing in his name they being indeed gods hands by which he reacheth counsell and religion which as through their hands are conveyed unto men christ having promised to open and shut them to stretch them out and draw them in as the hand of man is guided by the spirit that is in man
this chirothesia vel chirotonia for both occur in the new testament is used as an ecclesiasticall gesture at this day in token of elevation or ordination election and separation
and undefined span alphabet est quasi undefined span alphabet id est

manus tendo seu attollo in signum


to which appertains that cautionary symboll of st paul lay the hand suddenly on no man which interpreters expound of the care that is to be used that none should be admitted into roomes of divine calling but such who are called and are fit tam doctrina quam moribus for no man can lay the hand upon himselfe and be as basil tearmes it undefined span alphabet his own ordeiner for that is parallel unto the crime of jeroboam who filled his owne hand that is

ordained himselfe
to the signification and externall effects of imposition of hands in confirmation tertullian elegantly caro manus impositione adumbratur ut anima spiritu illuminetur
in sanation or conferring a corporall benefit on any imposition of hands is very naturall significant and agreeable to the mysterious intention for the hand is the generall salve that is applied and applies all remedies for naturally ubi dolor ibi digitus and necessarily in point of topicall application whose very approach doth most sensibly import reliefe and ease
our blessed saviour the great physitian of soule and body who did most of his miracles for restauration of bodily health though he were the truth and substance who gave an end to all legall shadowes yet he most commonly used the shadow of this naturall gesture to the more visible and significant application of his miraculous cures
he gave sight to the blinde yet not without touching the eye hearing to the deafe not without thrusting his finger into the eare and speech to the dumbe yet not without wetting the tongue most with this gesture of imposition
thus by touching simons

wifes mothers hand he cured her of her feaver
thus by putting forth his hand and touching the leper he healed him of his leprosie
thus by laying hands on the woman

that was troubled with a spirit of infirmity he loosed her from her and made streight

her bowed body
and it is said of him that he could doe no great workes in his owne countrey by reason of their unbeleefe save that he laid his hands upon a few sicke folkes and healed them
and indeed their sutes that

came unto him for helpe were commonly tendered and expressed in such formes of speech as shewed that he much used this significant expression of gesture
for although as fonseca truly

observes the flesh of our saviour for that it was the flesh of god gave life and health to all that touched it for a certain vertue went out from all parts of him and cured all men as the woman that had the issue of bloud experimentally found yet he was pleased so to honor the hand to use his hand in the conveyance and application of that curative vertue as that which in nature is the most important significant member of the body he could have said the word only and it had been done but he would speak reliefe with his hand
thus jairus besought him to come and lay

the hands upon his sicke daughter that she might be healed and live and they who brought the deafe and stammering man unto him besought

him to put his hand upon him whose requests were graciously answered in this desired and his accustomed formeof expression with his healing hand
and expositors agree that they required no expression of

pity from our saviours hands then what they had observed him to use thereby attributing unto him the honour and right of the chiefe prophet for it was an expression used by the ancient prophets as a holy charme against bodily infirmities and of the practice of this gesture attended with a visible successe the heathens were not ignorant apparent by the speech of naaman who was halfe wroth with elisha for

omitting this expression or pledge of health for the thought with himselfe that the prophet would have come out and stood and called upon the name of the lord his god and put his hand upon the place and heale the leprosie
after the ascention of our saviour his promise

was fulfilled that they should lay their hands on the sicke and they should be cured
thus paul received his sight by the laying

on of ananias hands
and thus paul healed the father of publius governour of the islle of

melita now malta
thus peter taking the cripple that sat at the gate of the temple called beautifull by the right hand recovered

him of his lamenesse
but of all the curetorie miracles wrought by the vertue of this expression of the apostles the casting out of divells and freeing the possessed most astonished the people especially after those sons of one sceva a jewish exorcist had took in hand to counterfeit that

powerfull gift by an unwarrantable imitation and were soundly beaten for their apish and vain attempt after the apostles times the exorcists an order in the primitive church used this curatorie

adjunct in commending those to god who were disquieted with divells
the curative

adjunct with a tangit te rex sana te deus is used in the conveyance of that charisme or miraculous

gift of healing which derived from the infancie of the church the inaugured monarchs of this land so happily enjoy in which expression of their sanative vertue they not only surpasse the fabulous cures of pyrrhus or vespasian of which plinie and others make mention but the pretended

vertues of other christian monarchs
and indeed it is a maxime ecclesiasticke that no miracle is wrought out of the church
and this miraculous imposition of the hand in curing the disease called the struma which from the constant effect of that sovereigne salve is called the kings evill
his sacred majesty that now is hath practised with as good successe as any of his royall progenitours

dactylogia or the dialects of the fingers
the hand the great artificer and active contriver of most corporall conceits receiving good intelligence of the patheticall motions of the minde proves a summarie or index wherein the speaking habits thereof significantly appear representing in their appearance the present posture of the phansie
and as we can translate a thought into discoursing signes so the conceptions of our minde are seen to abound in severall dialects while the articulated fingers supply the office of a voyce

a corollarie of the discoursing gesture of the fingers
with an historicall manifesto exemplifying their naturall significations
inventione laboro
gestus

the finger in the mouth gnawn and suckt is a gesture of serious and déep meditation repentance envy anger and threatned revenge
the signification of inventive meditation poets the most accurate observers of nature have elegantly acknowledged
thus propertius in the emendation of a verse

et saepe

immeritos corrumpas dentibus ungues

thus persius of an ill verse

nec pluteum caedit nec

demorsos sapit ungues

and horace of the sweating and sollicitous poet

saepe caput scaberet

vivos roderet ungues

who in another place describing the earnest posture of canidia brings her in gnawing her long

nailes

hic inresectum saeva dente livido canidia rodens pollicem

inresectum aiunt valde sectum aut non resectum id enim venificae magis convenit longos curvos{que gestare ungues quos incantationes suas

arrodant quod summam animi attentionem demonstrat as torrentius upon the place
and to this signification belongs that of the same poet

de ungui

and therefore in the areopagetique school and they painted among others cleanthes for the signification of his earnest study in arithmeticke and geometrie with his fingers gnawn about as sydonius apollinaris reports

goropius very witily fetcheth the reason of this gesture from the etimologie of the word finger thus digiti manus significant inveniendi desiderium nam in prima lingua dicuntur vinger qua vox denotat invenire desidero nam omis inveniendi facultas numeratione absolvitur ad numerandi artem digiti maxime sunt comparati numeros enim omnes digitis indicamus quo fit ut merito nomen habent ab inveniendi desiderio

to the signification of repentance propertius alludes

ungue meam morso saepe querere fidem

to the intention of envy that of martial is referred

ecce iterum

nigros corrodit ungues

id est pro invidia anxius corrodit ungues nigros as ramirez upon the place
this gesture is also a wilde expression of fierce anger and cruell revenge as aristotle advertiseth us who when he had reckoned up those actions which are

done by reason of some disease or evill custome

he puts downe this arrosion of the nailes which the interpreters of that place declare to be the

property of men inraged with choler and silently threatning revenge
and the italians a revengefull nation doe most usually declare by this gesture their gréedy coveting to be at hand with revenge and therefore that awfull satyrist of the angry potet

chaerestratus unguem

abrodens ait

so they report of orestes raging and transported with the furious appetite of revenge to have bitten his finger in arcadia where a

monument representing that expression of anger was built as pausanias hath left it recorded to posterity
and the masters of the hieroglyphiques

pourtray out this gesture to the same significations and if we see one bite his thumbe at us we soone infer he meanes us no good

fleo
gest
ii

to put finger in the eye is their expression who crie and would by that endeavour of nature ease themselves and give vent to their conceived heavinesse
the reason of putting finger in the eye in weeping is because teares falling from the eye with their saltnesse procureth a kinde of itching about the carnell of teares which requireth aid of the finger to be expressed at their first fall afterward the parts affected with that quality and one teare drawing on another such expression is not so necessary
besides this cause of rubbing the weeping eye a strange matter therein requireth wiping which also moveth

the finger to haste to the eye watered with teares but this is after a while the other almost before any teare fall as though they were expressed with rubbing
thus moagetes the tyrant of cibyra when he was greatly affrighted at the minatory words of the roman consul cn

manlius imposing the sum of five hundred talents in ready money to be laid down upon the naile counterfeiting and pretending his needinesse after much base huckling and rising by little and little one while hasting and wrankling another while praying and intreating and that with whining and putting finger in the eye he was fetcht over at length and came off to pay a good
talents of silver and deliver ten medimnes of corne besides

approbo
gest
iii

to hold up the thumbe is the gesture of one giving his voice or suffrage of one that helpeth with his word at the time of election and of one shewing his assent or approbation as flavius vopiscus writeth
the putting forth of

the finger also signifies an allowance of opinion advice and judgement of others wisely uttered in our presence

extollo
gest
iv

to hold up both the thumbs is an expression importing a transcendency of praise
hence horace

utro{que pollice dixit pro summo favore

fautor

utro{que tuam pollice ludum

of which proverbiall speech porphyrius conceit runs thus utro{que pollice id est utra{que manu synechdoche parte ad totum
an qui vehementius laudat manus jungens

jungit pollicem cum proximo

acron another way

utro{que pollice synechdoche manu utra{que sublata{que pariter ac saepius mota hic enim gestus valde laudantis est sane utra{que sicut ex iis concijci licet proverbij origofuit inquit erasmus

collateraliter monstro
gestus

to point with the turned out thumbe is a note of demonstration for as by divers gestures of the thumbe wee fignifie the various motions of our minde so by the same we are wont to point out and shew those wee love and such who deserve our commendations by putting forth this finger making it many times to usurpe the office of the index as may be collected out of claudian

metuens pollice

indico
gest
vi

the put forth the rest contracted to a fist is an expresse of command and direction a gesture of the hand most demonstrative
this finger being

called index ab indicando deicticos by the greeks id est demonstrator
hinc verbum pro re satis idoneum hoc est digito ostendere vel digitum intendere and hence some of the heathen gods were called indigiti because it was unlawfull to name them or point them out as it

were with this finger
the force of this finger in pointing out men of note and quality poets and historians the accurate observers of the naturall expressions of the fingers doe every where acknowledge in their writings alluding thereunto
thus the sinewie epigrammatist

rumpitur invidia quod turba semper ab omni





thus horace

quod digito praeteriuntium

thus the

saepe aliquis

digito vatem euntem

at{que ait hic hic est quem ferus urit amor

thus that obscure satyrist

at pulchrum est

digito dicier hic est

where the satyrist as lubentius comments upon the place taking an argument from the adjunct seems to have respect unto the history of demosthenes which cicero toucheth at who was

much affected with the mute encomium of this finger directed towards him by certaine women that were drawing water and saying this is demosthenes yet this is the same man diogenes the cinique pointed out in way of derision not with the index but the middle finger
to parallel

this with another example drawne out of historicall antiquity
the first time that themistocles

came to the olympique games after the victory obtained over xerxes navie at sea he was no sooner come into the but the people looked no more at them that fought but all cast their eyes on him shewing him unto the strangers that knew him not with their fingers and by clapping of their hands did witnesse how much they esteemed him who being a man ambitious by nature and covetous of honour was so much tickled with this publick demonstration of their loves that he confessed to his familiar friends he then did begin to reap the fruit and benefit of his sundry and painfull services he had taken for the preservation of greece
the naturall validity of this indigitation of persons and

pronominall vertue of this finger when accentively put forth appeared in the malipert demonstration of diphilus the tragedian when he acted

in the playes dedicated to the praise of apollo who when he came to that verse in his part miseria nostra magnus est directing his hand and pointing to pompey sirnamed the great he gave it a remarkable pronunciation and being constrained by the people who with their hands loud applause encouraged him to repeat the same divers times continuing in that gesture he drove out him that was guilty of too great and intollerable a power
but pylades for such

a speaking pranke of his finger came not off so well for octavius augustus caesar banished him out of the city of rome and italy because he had pointed with his finger at a spectatour who hissed him of the stage and so made him to be known
the valiant boucicaut instead of speech used such a point of declaration with his finger and as it is likely shewing some other of his fingers afterwards to signifie that he was a kin to him he pointed at as the fingers of his hand which are brethren
for in that furious battell that bajazet the turkish emperour waged against the king of hungarie

where there were many and the count of nevers the count of ewe and march and the valiant marshall boucicaut who the next day being brought before bajazet sitting under a pavilion spread for him in the field bajazet having heard by his interpretour that the count nevers ewe and march were neare kinsmen to the king of france caused them to be reserved commanding they should sit on the

ground at his feet where they were inforced to behold the lamentable but cherie of their nobility
the valiant marshall boucicaut in his turne was produced he who was wise and particularly inspired by god in this extremity made a signe with his finger before bajazet who understood not his language as if he would declare himselfe the kinsman of the count of nevers who beheld him with an eye so pitifull that it was of power to rent rocky hearts being perswaded by this signe that he was of the bloud royall caused him to be set apart to remaine a prisoner where he after wards by his great prudence endeavoured the liberty of those noble gentlemen and his owne
sometimes this fingers stands for an aduerbe of place
and it was the custome of the romans in the meetings of divers waies to erect a statue of mercurie with the pointing out the maine road in imitation whereof in this kingdome we have in such places notes of direction such is the hand of st albans
and the demonstrative force of this finger is such that we use to forewarne and rebuke children for pointing at the pallaces of princes as a kinde of petty treason
the roman histories afford us a notable example of the practice

of this moving adverbe of place in marcus manlius capitolinus for when he was accused for moving sedition and his matter came to pleading the sight of the capitoll troubled his accusers much for the very place it selfe where manlius had repulsed the gaules by night and defended the capitoll was easily seen from the where the matter was a hearing and he himselfe pointing with his hand

shewed the place unto the gods and weeping tenderly he laid before them the remembrance of the hazard of his life in fighting for their safety this did move the judges hearts to pity so as they knew not what to doe neither could they use the severity of the law upon him because the place of his notable good service was ever still before their eyes wherefore camillus finding the cause of delay of justice did make the place of judgement to be removed without the city into a place called the wood petelian from whence he could not shew them the capitoll and having deprived him of this advantage he was condemned
as it is a gesture of command and direction imperious masters with a stately kinde of arrogancie often use it to their meniall servants who stand ready expecting but the signall of their commands when they call them not without a taunt to execute the tacit pleasure of their lordly will an expression flowing into their hand from the hautinesse of spirit and an insolent humour of dominéering and the signe of pride is the greater when men to have their mindes thus discried and others to gueste at their meaning by what talking fingers exhibit as if their high raised spirits disdained to discend so low as to explaine their minde in words but thought it more then enough to signe out their intent with their fingers

terrorem incutio
gest
vii

the holding up of the is a gesture of threatning and uphraiding
hence this finger is called or by the latines quod eo minas inserimus

in utimur
the force of this finger in denouncing threatnings when it is brandished in way of terrour seneca acknowledgeth where he saith that of old in children solebat ciere lachrymas

digitorum motus
hence also plutarch borrowed his undefined span alphabet de eo qui alteri terrorem denunciat
to this may be referred the relation of a worthy and right elegant of ours in his

voyage into the levant who being in the isle rhodes and one morning prying up and down a turke met him and threatning him for an english man and a spie with a kinde of malicions posture laying his under his eye he seemed to have the looke of a designe

veneratione saluto gestus viii

the kissed in the naturall greetings of the hand hath been ever tooke for a complementall salutation and is used by those who adore worship give honor hanks or a faire resuect
hence called digitus vel because this finger as designed by nature to that office of respect hath been thought most convenient to performe the ceremony of a salutation
and saith

learned selden hath its derivation from this gesture quod ad ora sive os digitum
and the hebrewes use the phrase of this gesture for veneration
as concerning the signification of thankes implied by this gesture sir francis

bacon covertly acknowledgeth where he feignes a most proper and significant expression of the people of bensalem who lift their right hand towards heaven and draw it softly to their mouth which is the gesture they use when they thanke god

silentium indico
gest
ix

the laying of the upon the mouth is their habit who would expresse their silence conviction shame ignorance reverence servile feare modesty a revolving meditation admiration and amazement
after which manner also we crave and promise secrecie
to the signification of silence appertaines the proverbiall phrase taken from this gesture digitum ori imponere pro
whence the poet

compesce labellum

hence the five spies of dan unto the priest of micha hold thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth

hence also the coyners of the hieroglyphiques introduce this gesture to note taciturnite

to the signification of conviction or a modest ignorance belongs that of the sonne of syrach if thou hast understanding

answer thy neighbour if not lay thine hand on thy mouth
to the signification of admiration and amazement appertaines that of job marke me and be astonished and

lay your hand upon your mouth
and to this note of admiration that of apuleius may be

digitum pollice proximum ori suo admovens in stuporem attonitus tace tace inquit
this gesture of the index is likewise important in craving silence
for after this sort was the effigies of harpocrates framed among the aegyptians as a monument of silence
and the ancients were wont to weare in their rings the seale of harpocrates for this cause saith plinie that they might declare silence and secrecte

of the businesse in hand
hinc redde harpocratem

id est
hence alciat took his embleme

cum tacit haud quicquam differt sapientibus amens stultitiae est index lingua{que vox{que suae

ergo

premet labias digitoque silentia suadet sese pharium vertit in harpocratem

in this posture the image of titus livius of padua

was placed over the doore of the praetorium of that city for that he had comprised so much in his writings that he seemed to have denounced silence to all other writers
hence martianus capella verum quidem redemitus puer ad

os compresso digito salutari silentium commonebat
and in allusion to ts gesture ovid

qui{que premet vocem

digito{que silentia suadet

the aegyptian priests indian brachmans the persian magi and the french druides and all the old philosophers and wise men very politickly caused to mould pourtrait their gods with their fingers upon their lips to teach men their adorers not to be too curious enquirers after their nature or rashly fable forth what ever they imagine of them lest that being discovered they should have been found in the end to have been but men either worthy in their time for warre or peace and after their death deified
heraiscus is reported to have come out of his mothers wombe with this finger the index of silence

fixed upon his lips in the same manner as the aegyptians feigne orus to have been borne and before him sol whereupon because this finger clave to his mouth it was faine to be removed by incision and the sear remained alwayes in his lip a conspicuous signe of his close and mysticall nativity
as concerning the use of this

gesture to intimate we know somewhat which neverthelesse we will not utter or this way of promising secrecie when we are required they are expressions that many times occur in the actions of common life

redarguo gestus

the bowing downe of the for a checke of silence and to redargue is an action often found in the hands of men
this gesture if objected with a more frequent motitation obtaines the force of an ironicall expression and with the ancients it was called ciconia or the storke from the forme of a storks bill pecking which it seemes to imitate
that darke satyrist the obscure richnesse of whose stile doth much depend upon such adjuncts of expression alluding to this gesture

jane tergo quem nulla

ciconia pinsit

and st hierom whose workes are very curiously garnished with such criticall observations very elegantly alludes to the same expression qui siscirent holdam viris tacentibus prophetasse nunquam post tergum meum

manum incurvarent in ciconiam
the greeks in this matter call it the crow as causabon gathers out of hesiod thus interpreted

cave inquit domum linquas imperfectam ne caput tibi tundat garrula cornix

compello gest
xi

the lifting up and bowing of the index towards the face is a usuall gesture of invitation as naturally significant to that intent as the inward waving of the whole hand and is a naturall synechdoche of gesture whereby we use a part for the whole hand he that shall set himselfe to observe the manners

and discoursing gestures of men shall soone finde this observation to be true and valid

veto
gest
xii
the raising up and bowing the from us is a gesture naturall to those who becken a retreat or forbid and is a synechdoche of gesture whereby we significantly use the index for the whole hand though annex no example of this gesture yet the validity thereof is not much the lesse and when all is done somewhat must be left to observation and if it be matter of oversight in the cursory reading over of some histories then my reader hath an opportunity to oblige me by a more happy invention and application yet prudent omissions have their places and an universall forestalment of a readers fancie or memory is one of the foure and twenty properties of a moyling pedant

diffidentiam noto
gestus xiii

to feel with the fingers ends is their scepticall expression who endeavour to satisfie themselves by information of the tact in the qualities of a thing
a gesture that proceeds from the instinct of nature whereby we know our hand to be the judge and discerner of the touch for although this touching vertue or tactive quality be diffused through the whole body within and without as being the foundation of the animal being which may be called animalitas yet the first and second qualities which strike the sense we doe more curiously

and exquisitely feele in the hand then in the other parts and more exactly where the epidermis or immediate organ of the outer touch is

thinnest but most subtily in the grape of the index which being the only part of the body that hath temperamentum ad pondus is by good right chiefe to the king of the five senses
the satisfaction the hand gives the minde by this gesture made alciat taking his hint from plautus who seems to me to have called

this expression manum occulatam to represent in embleme the certainty of things by an eye in a hand
hence manus oculata the adage and verily we may well beleeve this occular test or

feeling eye of the hand
thomas dydimus as diffident as he was received a palpable satisfaction

by this way of silent information

mollicie prodo
gestus xiv

to scratch the head with one is a kinde of nice and effeminate gesture bewraying a close inclination to vice observed in many by cunning motists who have found the way to prie into the manners of men
a gesture so remarkable that it grew into an adage

digito uno caput scalpere by a metonymie of the adjunct signifying impudence effeminacy taken by critiques out of juvenal who hath given a satyricall lash at this gesture
pompey was publickly upbraided to his face with this note of effeminacy by clodius the tribune asking aloud these questions who is the licenciousest captaine in all the city what man is he that seeks for a man what is he that scratcheth his head with one finger some that hee had brought into the for that purpose like a company of dancers or singers when he spake and clapped his hands on his gowne answered him strait aloud to every question

that it was pompey
as concerning the phrase of seeking for a man that prince of the senate of critiques sayes that he hath read in an old manuscript of an interpreter of lucan never published this distich

magnus quem metuunt homines

digito caput uno scalpit quid credas hunc sibi velle virum

molles enim solent virum quaerere
cicero also observed in caesar

the same genuine fashion of his hand as appeares by the opinion he once had of caesar when saith he consider how fairly he combeth his fine bush of haire and how smooth it lyeth and that see him scratch his head with one finger only my minde gives me that such a kinde of man should not have so wicked a thought in his head as to overthrow the state of the
by the way cannot but note that two of the greatest commanders rome could ever boast of concurrents intime and competitors for the empire of the world should be both branded with one and the note of effeminacie

convicium facio
gest
xv

the putting forth of the the rest drawn into a fist on each side which is then called undefined span alphabet by the greeks

vulgarly higa in the ancient tongue pugner undefined span alphabet is a naturall expression of scorne and contempt
this gesture is called catapygon by the athenians id est cinaedus

scortum quia pronus ad obscoenitatem quod infamiam concuteret convicium faceret which is well noted by that elegant epigrammatist

rideto multum qui te sextile cinaedum

dixerit

digitum porrigito medium

id est si te sextile cynaedum vocaveret tu eandem contumeliam ei objice repende

sublato medio digito quae nota cynaedi est non solumenim ad sed etiam ad infamiam molliciem alicujus denotandum valet
to which that of plautus may be referred

in hunc

intende digitum hic leno est

hence also martial calls this finger digitum

ostendit digitum sed

derides quo{que fur

ostendis digitum mihi minanti

perseus calls it

infami

with acron and porphyrius it is
euphormio calls it
et hic quidem

intendebat improbum reclusae digitum dextrae describing the posture of exprobration in some images
in another place the epethite is flagitiosus callion digito superiorem explicans barbam

with plantus it is manus pullaria palpandis tentandis{que pullis as turnebus thinks
and by others
hence with the athenians undefined span alphabet id est scimalissare est praetentare digito ubi quemquam flocci facere ostendunt nam et si proprie graecis sit cum digito pertentamus ecquid gallinam ova conceperit tamen verbo eodem utantur cum protensum

ostendunt medium digitum concerning which expression juvenal

fortuna ipse minaci

mandaret laqueum

medium{que ostenderet unguem nam medio digito aliquid monstrare per siebat ob ejus as lubinus upon the place
this pointing out with the finger

in way of mockerie tertullian calls digito destinare

that the scoffing motion of this finger moves an apprehension of what we intend may plainly be gathered out of the prophesie of the prophet isaiah where he saith if thou take away

from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and evill speaking which by the most of expositors is conceived to be meant of this very gesture

although divines have variously descanted upon the place
in this sense also that of the wise man may be understood the wicked man speaketh with his finger that is his finger by gestures and signs speaks scoffes
as doctor jermin in his paraphrasticall comment upon the place
lampridius speaking of the notorious effeminacie and luxurious impudencie of that sottish emperour heliogabalus among other expressions of his corrupted minde reports him to have used this nec enim unquam verbis pepercit infamibus cum

digitis ostentaret nec ullus in conventu audiente populo esset pudor
thus caligula was wont to flout and frump cassius chaerea

tribune of the praetorian cohort in most opprobrious tearmes as a wanton and effeminate person
and one while when he came unto him for a to give him priapus or venus another while if upon any occasion he rendered thankes to reach out unto him his hand not only fashioned but wagging also after an obscene and filthy manner
cassius a right valiant man and one that distasted the corrupted manners of those times tooke this reproach of effeminacie so ill at calligula's hand that he bore him a particular grudge for this very cause and was the

man that conspiring with cornelius sabinus his fellow tribune deprived him of life and empire
thus diogenes when certain strangers in a great assembly were very inquisitive to know which was demosthenes diogenes in derision putting

forth this finger instead of the index pointed him out and shewed him unto them covertly thereby noting the impudent nature and effeminacie of the man
and it may be the envie and despite of josephs brethren towards him

shewed it selfe in the contumelious gesture of this finger which pointed out unto him their contempt of him when he was afar off and waking towards them when they said one unto another behold this dreamer commeth

contemno
gestus xvi

to compresse the with the thumbe by their complosion producing a sound and so casting out our hand is a gesture we use to signifie our contempt of unprofitable things to shew by gesture how we sleight contemne insult and undervalue any thing
this knacking with the fingers was called by the ancient romans crepitus or percussio digitorum
hence that illustrious poet expounding the sense of this expression makes mention of the thumb which he therefore calls argutum id est resonantem whose verses very cleare for this businesse run thus

cum poteret seram media jam nocte matellam

arguto madidus pollice

arguto pollice that is as he hath in another place

crepitu digitorum
and propertius to the same purpose

illi

pollicibus fragiles increpuere manus

the posture of the same expression prepared to create a sound the statue of stone at tharsis which plutarch speaks of to have been made for

sardanapalus after his death and set over his grave did significantly retaine which statue was formed dancing after the barbarian fashion and as it were with his fingers over his head like an anticke the inscription was sardanapalus

the son of anacynderaxa built anchialus and tarsus in one day but thou my friend

eat drinke the wanton leacher play for nothing else is ought say

signifying the undervaluing sound produced by such a knacking of the fingers ede bibe nam caetera omnia sunt illius sonitus quem efficere manus solet as athaeneus hath it

ironiam infligo
gestus xvii

to bend the while itstifly resteth upon the thumb and so in ie to let it off is a triviall expression whereby we with a fillip inflict a trifling punishment or a scoffe
this fillip with the finger or naile some thinke is so called sono fictitio qui cum talitrum alicui impingitur datur and talitrum talione est enim ludi genus inter pueros quo par pari refertur

vel recurvi digiti impressio unde forte melior denominatio latinae vocis talo convolutio digitorum quem emulatur undefined span alphabet graecis
that this gesture was called talitrum by the ancient latines appears by suetonius who speaking of tiberius and the native vigour of his left hand articulis

ita firmis fuit ut caput pueri vel etiam adolescentis

talitro vulneraret
sometimes they were said

scimalissare who in mockery used this gesture
a kinde of punishment we usually inflict upon unhappy wags
hence that of petronius ego durante

adhuc iracundia non continui manum sed caput miserantis stricto acuto{que articulo percussi
percussit undefined span alphabet pueri gitonis caput
this slighting expression of the fingers gives such a slur of disgrace if used to men that it hath been thought such a disparagement as wounded a tender reputation
sir francis bacon in his charge in the

touching duells being then his majesties atturney generall informes against the hot spirited gallants of those times who pretended a defect in our law that it hath provided no remedy for fillips
a strange thing that every touch or light blow of the person though they are not in themselves considerable save that they have got upon them the stampe of a disgrace should make these light things passe for such great matters
the law of england and all laws hold these degrees of injury to the person slander battery maime and death but for the apprehension of disgrace that a fillip to the person should be a mortall wound to the reputation he saith it were good that men would hearken to the saying of gonsalvo the great and famous commander that was wont to say a gentlemans honor should be de crassiore of a good strong warpe or web that every little thing should not catch in it when as now it seems they are but of or such light stuffe which certainly is weaknesse and not true greatnesse of minde but like a sicke mans body that is so tender that it feels every thing

contemptuose provoco
gestus
xviii

to becken with the is their usuall concise expression who are advanced by confidence to relie upon the strength of their ability and would by a provoking signall dare chalenge defie and bid one prepare for an encounter implying a strong presumption of the victory as if they esteemed him as nothing in their hand
to this expression horace alludes

crispinus

minimo me accipe si vis

accipe jam

avaritiam prodo
gestus xix

to gripe the left hand the thumbe clutched in with all is the gesture of tenacious avarice and significant to discover the miserable and penurious condition of a niggard a parcell of the character of an old
this catching and restrained gesture is an expression often seen in the hands of and men of a terene complexion and is parallel to the thumbe under the girdle
the aegyptian mythologists who

were very quaint in their occult devices used to paint out avarice by this posture of the left hand and they who allegorically interpret

dreames make this hand the symboll of lucre profit gaine and increase as the hand more fitting to retaine for though it want the diligence and insinuating labour peculiar to the right hand and hath not the faculty to scrape and get by such dexterious endeavours notwithstanding being more dull and sluggish the retentive appetite thereof is thereby increased and it is the misers maxime and as it were the signet on his wretched hand

non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri

this hand by the grave testimony of solinus

which camerarius also affirmes to doe any thing is lesse agile but to beare burdens and to comprehend any thing strongly is more fit for jael tooke the hammer in her right hand but the naile in her left which she smote through the temples of sisera and the three hundred souldiers of gedeon held their lamps in their left hands and

the trumpets in their right hand which marius hath drawne into an allegorie of other significations

offensiunculam resentio
gest
xx

to give one a rap with the fingers half bent or knuckles is their expression who would vent their sleight anger or dislike upon others or would softly and modestly knocke at some doore
this posture of the hand was called by the ancients condylus scilicet digiti articulus aut nodus in curvitura quae digitis flectitur
the stroake inflicted with the hand thus composed hath from antiquity retained the name of condyl this the greeks call

undefined span alphabet
we read of a boy who attended at the banquet of aeneas slaine by hercules with a stroake of his condyl called archias as hellenicus writes other eunomius the sonne of architeles but in phoronidos
he is named cherias who dyed of that blow in calydon although hercules intended not his death but chastisement
the greeks also write that thersites was slaine by the condyles of achilles because he had strucken out the eye of penthisilea slaine by him with his speare
this gesture is sometimes used by those who would signifie their desire of being

let in at a doore and in this sense it was modestly used by bagoas the eunuch at the tent doore of holofernes his master whom he supposed to have slept with judith
dorleans upon tacitus saith

he did plausum facere manibus to awaken his master but it is most likely he used the sound of this gesture as a mannerly watchword to intimate his attendance without and a desire to come in and speake with him an expression that hath been ever used by such who came to salute or speake

with great persons in a morning to intimate their modest and obsequious attendance which they seemed by that low knock to desire their patrons to take notice of

iram impotentem prodo
gestus xxi
to put the fingers into a gripe or aspect and to scratch or claw another therewith is the impotent expression of a curst heart that eagerly desires to set a marke of its displeasure upon those that have provoked it to a splenitique use of its pounces
but this is no manly expression of the hand as more properly appertaining to children and vixens who are prone upon any provocation to wreak their despite upon others with the talons of their indignation
fury that hath furnished all men with weapons left the tongue the nail to the impotent part of humanity two venemous weapons and apt to wranckle where they fasten
and if we see this in the face of any we are apt to infer that it is the marke of some such impotent creature

stultitiae notam infigo
gestus xxii

to present the index and wagging with the thumb

aplied unto the temples is their expression who would scornfully reprove any for failing in any exercise of wit or for some absurd stumble of a tripping and inconsiderate lip or for some errour in manners and behaviour for this most ridiculous affront implies such men to be asses
the reason is for that man only by natures provident donation hath received cares fixt and immoveable whereas that which appears most moveable and stirring in that dull animall is his eares and the wagging of the fingers goes for the wagging of the eares which cannot be done otherwise by reason of this naturall prohibition
perseus alludes to this ironicall signification of the fingers

nec manus auriculas imitata est mobilis albas

hence manum addere the adage a metaphor taken

from this gesture
the same gesture if you take away the motion is used in our nimblefingered times to call one cuckold to present the badge of cuckoldry that mentall and imaginary horn seeming to cry man of happy note whom fortune meaning highly to promote hath stucke on thy the of succeeding good lucke all which upbraiding tearmes many understand by this gesture only of the fingers for in this sense the common use hath made it the known signall of disparagement so naturally apt are the fingers to speake scoffes for lacivious disdaine masked by scorn under the disguise of a facetious wit out of an itching disposition hath been ever very prone to devise and happen upon waies to vent her conceited bitternesse it being the guise of overweening wit to despise and undervalue others

hence comes your scornfull frumpe and drie scoffe keen jeers that wit hath turned up trump wherein the dealer rubbeth with a gibe making another his laughing stocke which cunning game is received into rhetoricke and called an ironie a trope which gives a man leave closely to carpe at the manners of men wherein what which is expressed by words the contrary is shewn by the gesture nay we may make a wity board without the helpe and concurrence of an unhappy word and your broad verball jest is nothing neare so piquant as these foule habits of reproach by gesture which broch men as it were with a spit and having once entred into the quicke like shafts with barbed heads a long time gaule with a sticking mischiefe and to this feat of mockery the fingers have been proclive to fashion out contempt provoked forward by a naturall dicacity

improbitatem objicio
gestus xxiii

to locke the thumbe betweene the next two fingers is an ironicall vulgarisme of the hand used by plebeians when they are contumeliously provoked thereunto and see that they cannot prevaile by vieing words their spleene appealing to their fingers for aid who thus armed for a dumbe retort by this taunting gesture seem to say avant
this position of the fingers with the ancients was called higa and the moderne spaniards by objecting the hand formed to this reproachfull expression imply as

much as if they should say paedicavi te with us it is usually their garbe who mocke little children

parcè do
gest
xxiv

to give vvith two fingers is a parcimonious expression of the hand often seen in niggards and from whose gesture the adage came dare contracta manu id est parce frigide aliquid dare
hence the spaniards in the propriety of their tongue expresse covetousnesse by a short hand and bounty by a long and large hand
these phrases do often occur in guzman which take for a subtile contexture of the proverbiall riches and gravity of the spanish tongue
salomon dislikes this gesture where he saith let not thy hand be open to take and closed when thou shouldest give
and artaxerxes the son of xerxes who was

sirnamed long hand because he had one hand longer then another was wont to say that as a prince who was gods image upon earth he had a hand to give to wit a right hand very long the other to and take away to wit a left hand contracted and very short adding that it was a more princely and royall property to give then to take away

numero gestus xxv

to begin with the first finger of the left hand and to tell on to the last finger of the right is the naturall and simple way of numbring computation for all men use to count forwards till they come to that number of their fingers and being come to that number prompted as it were by nature to returne at this bound or but of numericall immensity about which all numbers are reflected and driven round they repeat againe the same numbers returning unto unity from

whence their account began which we must not account as an accident but a thing propagated from the fountaine of nature since it is ever done and that by all nations
for the fingers by an ordinance of nature and the unrepealable statute of the great arithmetician were appointed to serve for casting counters as quicke and native digits alwaies ready at hand to assist us in our computations
hence some have called man a naturall arithmetician and the only creature that could reckon and understand the mistique laws of numbers because he alone hath reason which is the spring of arithmeticall account nay that divine philosopher doth draw the line of mans understanding from this computing

faculty of his soule affirming that therefore he excells all creatures in wisdome because he can account and indeed not the least of the more subtill part of reason doth depend upon this arithmeticall infused quality
hence we account such for idiots and men who cannot tell to the native number of their fingers
and if we count the dole of nature and those numbers that were borne with us and cast up in our hand from our mothers wombe by him who made all things in number weight measure we shall finde that there are five fingers ranged upon either hand which quinary construction of the fingers as being of a mysticall perfection is much canvased by the pythagoran philosophers

and called marriage because it is a compound of the first numerall male and female it is also fitly tearmed nature because being multiplied it determins and rebounds upon it selfe for five times five makes twenty five and multiplied by an old

number it still representeth it selfe for if you take five unto five by doubling the cinque you make the decade and there is in it a naturall vertue or faculty to divide as appeares in the fingers of each hand so that nature seems to have tooke more delight to order and compose things according to the number of five then to fall upon any other forme that might have proved sphericall
hence plutarch observes that the ancients were wont to use the verbe pempasesthai

when they would signifie to number or to reckon
and the memphian priests in their hieroglyphiques by a hand the fingers set upright used to figure out arithmeticke
great is the perfection of the totall summe of our fingers for ten is the fount and head of all numbers for this is compounded of


and
which united summe up ten the most compleat of numbers as possest of the formes of all the others for both the eaven and odde the square cubique plaine the linear the monade and compound with all the rest are comprised in the decade which therefore pythagoras the samian who was thought to be the first author of the name philosophie as plutarch affirmes concludes the denarie to be the most absolute perfection of numbers because as the poet saith we have

digitos per quos solemus

hadrianus junius by an elegant and neat discription seems to allude to the intention of nature in devising the hand so fit for all accounts that it may serve for a counting table

nomenclator

of the necessitie and dignitie of this art of manuall rhetorick
praeludium

how prevalent gestures accommodated to perswade have ever been in the hand both the ancient worthies as also use and daily experience make good it being a thing of greater moment then the vulgar thinke or are able to judge of which is not onely confined to schooles theaters and the mansions of the muses but doe appertaine to churches courts of common pleas and the where we daily see many admirable things done by those who in the course of humanitie and profitable studies have been well instructed and inform'd in this facultie of the hand
and the wisedom of the ancients is in good part placed in this care and diligence that they who were nourished to the hopes of great dignities should have

composed and comely motions which might signifie an ingenious minde and adorne their very eloquence
some may perchance imagine that this manuall rhetorique is a vaine and unnecessary art because they see little writ by the greekes who were the doctors of eloquence and but few things thereof by the latines when yet these men of excellent wits of both nations have with great artifice beautified all the sublime kindes of eloquence to heighten the grandieure of a majestique utterance
cresollius alleadgeth many causes why this one part of most noble science seemes though not as neglected yet passed by and omitted by those great lights of antiquitie
for the greekes borne in a region which by reason of the thinnesse and puritie of the aire was more fertile of good wits then any other productions had naturally both motions of the minde and body to explaine and unfold their cogitations and recondite senses with an incredible facilitie by reason whereof they needed the precepts of this art
for since they had two palaestra's wherein a double chironomia was practised one of armes another of peace and proper to the pacifique temper of humanitie a domesticall theater doctors and rhetorique professors and publique declamations having in common among them such

illustrious aides of pronunciation no marvell that so few rhetoricians have left any manuscripts of the conformation of gesture this artifice of the hand being a thing so common and as it were naturall unto them
which volubility of a prompt easie nature wonderfully accommodating it selfe to all things made the satyrist say that the whole nation

of the greekes were comoedians for in the scene and theater and in graphicall assimilating and imitating the affections there were few of any nation could match them and none that could them
and as they were very studious in all kinds of literature when they apply'd their minds to eloquence it cannot be said how they excel'd in gesture by the force and guide of nature which perchance was the cause why the stagerite said undefined span alphabet to be undefined span alphabet that rhetorique was

naturall and that any one without the instructions of a teacher seems to be of himself by a naturall ingenie fit to raise motions in himselfe and others
but the romans comeing out to speake not from under the canopie of minerva but the pavilion of mars being not of so ready polished a wit thought it convenient and necessary to have books of institutions for the conformation of these rhetoricall expressions of which plotius and nigidius two great doctors in these elegancies

to omit others published their beauteous commentaries
they that follow aristotle in his mistaken opinion of action esteeming these chironomicall notions as things of no great matter are much deceived for that great doctor of the

lyceum as cresollius well observes spake rather of himselfe then of all men in generall who being of a most excellent wit and by nature furnished with all ornaments he contemned rhetoricians as seeing himself to have little need of those petty rules which were carried about for the conformation of manuall gestures
for else he had demosthenes in his eyes a man wholly composed of this artifice and turn'd after a manner upon the wheele of rhetorique who at first by reason of his naturall imperfection herein was much discouraged by which it appeares that an oratour is not borne but made and to speake well and laudably there is need of studie and striving before the facultie can be attained
for as for this opinion of ignorant men who thinke that gestures are perfect enough by nature and that the climate availes nothing it being not materiall whether the hand be moved hither or thither that every one may please himselfe observing no rule or admonition of rhetoricians the daily example of speakers refute
for we see many both in sacred

and prophane places so preposterously ilfavoredly expressing their minds that tis a wonder how any eye can behold them with attention
certainly men polished with humanitie cannot without loathing behold the praevarications of such durty and slovenly oratours and with a just indignation distaste their inconsiderate action
if the naturall motions were absolutely compleat sufficiently fit to open unfold the sense of the mind or were accommodated to gaine good will or opportune for the incredible force and varietie of the affections would these goodly orators and lovers of faire speech so bewray themselves and wallow in the dirt but this is enough to prove that the actions of the hand are not perfect by nature
therefore let those upstart and tumultuarie oratours bragge as much as they will of the force of nature and facilitie of gestures
reason and the sayings of the learned ancients doe not onely gainsay them but prove these cosmetique gestures of the hand to be things of great moment the very palme and crown of eloquence
had the ancient pieces of this art which ingenious oratours writ of old more for the benefit of then their own come to our hands men might have beene more ready in speaking then they are and not so prone in these points to offend

the discreeter part of their auditory but since those helpes are lost cannot see how an oratour can be perfect and absolutely compleat that hath not consulted with the oracle of quintilian about this manuall pronunciation whose institutions contain all those ancient subtleties that escaped the injurious hand of time
things which of old they were wont to learne with their grammar as sidonius apollinaris witnesseth which perchance was the reason why polihymnia whom that learned senatour affirmes to have

taught the elegancie of gesture the same by the greeks is said to have taught grammar and letters
and indeed decencie of expression doth so depend upon this art that as grammarians observe decencie is properly spoken of gesture and motions of the hand and body and it so exalts beauty from the concrete into the abstract that nature and the tacit voice and assent of all men allow of it as a thing very materiall in commerce and is so look'd for at the hand of an orator that the defects of extemporarie and jejune orations have been covered by the elegancies of this artifice and those that have come off unhandsomly with their expressions for want of these comely and palliating graces of elocution were ever laughed at and justly derided

chironomia or the art of manuall rhetoricke

the clazomenian sage as plutarch reports of him upon a curious speculation of the properties and motions of the hand as it were in an extasie of

admiration concluded man to be the wisest of all creatures because he had hands as if they were the spring and fountaine of all intellectuall and artificiall elegancies which opinion of anaxagor as galen with

great elegancie and humanity by way of inversion corrects that because man was the wisest of all creatures therefore he had hands given him the hands being added that as he was the most intelligent so he might have fit organs to do and explain what his knowledge did inlight him unto art in the hand being the same with science in the intellect nor is the genius of nature

silent herein
plutarch endeavours to give an allegoricall interpretation of this saying of

anaxagoras manus est causa
manus id est experientia est causa sapientia
but in regard

of the rhetoricall properties of the hand man may well be called chiresophus id est manu sapiens
galen excellently observes

man to be armed by nature with three weapons reason the loud weapon of the tongue and the hand which may be gave the hint to the president of the colledge of critiques to make them all

three hands in that golden saying of his wherein he subtilly sets forth the rhetoricall force and dignity of the hand ratio est manus intellectus rationis oratio orationis manus
hence the hand the famous companion of reason hath ever obtained the preheminence in gesture and been the domius fac totum in all matters of corporeall eloquence as appeares by the cleare testimony of the learned sages and the chirogrophie of elder time
hippocrates calls the hand optimum dicendi magistrum
the brother of basil very copiously

sets out the rhetoricall worth of this goodly scepter and caduceus of ingenuity
rectè statuitur manus esse proprium quoddam naturae loquendi facultate praeditae instrumentum hunc potissimum ad finem effict as ut earum opere expiditior in nobis sermonis esset usus
cassiodorus saw also the force of this of wisdome and living

implement of elocution manus singulariter datae ad multas cogitationes nostras communitur explicandas
the younger plinie would have this

saying marked and registred recitantium propria pronunciationis adjumenta esse manus
and one taking his hint out of the poesie of homer makes this honourable mention thereof

desectis manibus pereunt quo{que palladis artes

hence the latines significantly call the hand

manum manando quod hoc instrumento potissimum actiones nobis emanent
therefore the

greeks for good cause seem to have called the hands undefined span alphabet ab utilitate for that they are not only assistant to eloquence but doe incredibly conduce to all the offices of reason and humanity
for it is the choisest friend of art the artificer of elocution the brother of the phansie and remembrancer to her that dwells backwards in the high towre of pallas the bodies will and intellect the gift the wit and ingenuity of the outer man and the better genius of the microcosme in which minerva's darlings the phalanx of the muses and the pierian band are trained exercised as in a convenient palestra or gymansium
the logisticall motions that appear in the hands of disputants as they demonstrate the large command of the signifying faculty of the body which flows not only into the vocall organs but proceeds so far as to the hands so they significantly argue the hand to be a peculiar instrument of reasonable nature especially ordeined to set a glosse upon the vocal expressions of the mind
the hand being a part so prompt officious to afford the tongue necessary aid so powerfully inclined by its naturall gifts and abilities to bring reliefe to reason so apt and fit on all essayes to deale in matters of expression and to affect the hearers mindes that whereas man by a happy endowment of nature is allowed two instruments speech and a hand to bring his concealed thoughts unto light the tongue without the hand can utter nothing but what will come forth

lame and impotent whereas the hand without the discourse of the tongue is of admirable and energeticall efficacie and hath atchieved many notable things
all histories abound with the exploits of the hand which hath performed and brought to passe more things by a significant silence then the tongue hath ever done by an audible demonstration
apollonius tyaneus by

his most famous example alone shall serve to cleare this point who when he had with an incredible religion observed the pythagorean silence neither had suffered any word to fall from him during the space of five whole yeares yet when he came into cities labouring of sedition undefined span alphabet manu at{que vultu sedabat discordias after which manner hee travelled through pamphylia cilicia and other regions of the earth for whatsoever is exprest by the hand is so manifestly spoken that men of the most obtuse understanding that are not able to conceive of the words pronounced in an unknown tongue to whom an oratours spent oyle is meerly lost because their rich and elegant expressions in conceits transcend the pitch of their capacity yet these may see and perceive the intention of the hand which by gestures makes the inward motions of the minde most evident for all men a thing nature hath so appointed are stirred moved by the same motives of the mind and doe in others understand and take notice of the same moving demonstrations by experience judging and approving in themselves those affections that outwardly appeare to worke upon others
hence the ingenious are forced to confesse that all things are more expressive in the

hand as that which doth garnish the sense of words and gives the shape figure and winning glory unto eloquence
this strengthens speech with nerves and the sinewed cords of twisted reason
speech divided from the hand is unfound and brought into a poore and low condition flags and creeps upon the ground
the babling tongue indeed may have a long and spacious walke and the full mouth may prate and run ore with large and loud impertinencies but without the concurrence of the hand the mouth is but a running sore and hollow fista of the minde and all such ayery trash but the cracks of an uprofitable lip that wants the assistance of those native orators which were designed to attend the perfect issue of a well delivered cogitation for what can we expect from that eloquence that neglects the motions of the hand or what can we conceive can be wrought out of that which is maimed and deformed that should bee able to worke upon the affections whence a grave father an author of classicall authority the high pitch of whose fancie some

may chance to admire borne on the rapture of his thought run so high in his expressions that he denies that man could have enjoyed the honour of an articulate voice had not nature planted this magazine of speech in the body and stored it with native ammunition for the defence and arming of orall reason
and verily if man were disarmed of this native weapon or organ intended for the speciall advancement of utterance wanting the subtle force of his hand and fingers the expression of his tongue would be very weake and unhewed for the motions of

the hand in pronunciation doe much enrich and endeare the expressions of the tongue which without them would many times appeare very meane and if we consider the orations yet remaining among the ruines of former ages which were publickly pronounced wee may cease to admire the advantages they have had over others or themselves only penned so that we may not so much wonder how they having been armed by discourse and voyce together with the emphatical assistance of the hand have produced such prodigious effects for these gracefull aids of speech and advantages are so peculiar to pronunciation and the hand that the pen or preffe knoweth not what they mean
this

is sufficiently confirmed by what quintilian reports of hortensius a long time prince of orators afterwards coevall and competitour with cicero but alwayes accounted the second whose writings notwithstanding were so short of that fame of his living eloquence of pronunciation that it appeares there was somewhat in those orations he pronounced which pleased very well which they who came afterwards to read could not finde the gifts of speaking and writing well although compatible yet not so inseparable that he who pretends to one must necessarily bee possest of both
that virgin monarch queene elizabeth of famous memory whose apothegmes may passe among the oracles of royall reason and civill prudence having heard or rather seen a sermon that was preached before her with the advantage of pronunciation was much affected and taken therewith and having the same sermon afterwards presented unto

her when she came to read it and found not the insinuations of elocution and gesture gave her judgement of it that it was one of the best sermons she ever heard and the worst she ever read

not only prophane but sacred authours have taken notice of this solemne bond and rhetoricall obligation between the hand and the mouth and have not only allowed the language of the fingers by which the ancients were wont to speake but have likewise punctually set downe the office of these the hands and gravely noted their necessary imployment and concurrence to the more advantagious setting out of speech
among the recorded advantages of gesture and rhetoricall uniformity the observation of noverinus is not to be passed over

in silence whose ingenious animadversion it is that the septuagint in their version of the proverbs where solomon bringeth in wisdome

speaking and where st hieroms translation or the vulgar latine hath it extendi manum meam in the septuagint translation it is undefined span alphabet extendebam sermones for that speech may have life and efficacie in it the hands must goe out and gesture must appeare to the eye that it may give evidence to both senses and solomon where he accuseth the sloathfull man for not

bringing his hand to his mouth seems to have cast an eye upon the old aegyptian symboll and to have said his hands touch not his lips his action agrees not with his voyce for to this sense the exposition of saint gregory may with little wresting be drawn manum ad os porrigere est voci suae opera concordare a good dependance

necessary relation the hand is joyned to the lips and the lips must be so knit and held with the hands that sometimes our very words and speeches are turned into hands as the septuagint in this place insinuate
and it is observable that the spirit that is called the finger of god appeared under the form of fiery tongues a most excellent

connexion land it may be not without a rhetoricall mystery of divine and powerfull elocution the gift of speaking being granted hereby as well to the hand as the tongue and a doore of utterance opened by the spirit in both no marvell therefore that they of listra seeing the chiefe speaker of the apostles speaking in the power of these tongues as this finger gave him utterance tooke paul for mercury their imaginary

god of eloquence
since therefore the tgue is obliged to the hand it will become elegant divines to be good at action bring thy hand to thy mouth and tye thy tongue to thy finger and thou hast a most perfect symboll of rhetoricall heat and divine expression

for the hand of the artificer the worke shall be commended and the wise ruler of the people for his speech saith the son of syrach
it stands him in hand therefore who would emblazon the

armes of the queen of the affections eloquence to use her owne pencill the hand of a most secret property to quicken speech for where eloquence swayes the scepter the graces of utterance forsake their place and the feeblenesse of the proper forces of the tongue are perceived if they be not this way relieved by the hand by whose armes and allurements as it were by main force the ancient orators have so often extorted

approbation from their auditors and by this third supply of elegant deportment invading the minde through the eye with easie accesses put themselves into the possession of the people and questionlesse those brave generous formes of discourse wherein art hath beene married to abundance and richnesse of speech mixed with sweetnesse and majesty of action wherewith those great and strange conceptions of the ancients have been so curiously limbed and plentifully adorned and graced are but too slenderly taken notice of in these times the perfections whereof can be of no meane importance when without the helpe of this great secret neither ornament of art nor grace of nature can be but in part pleasing nor as one well observes shall all the reasons the tongue can alledge perswade

a very woman resolving to resist for the hands are those common places and topiques of nature which receive most of those extraordinary motions which appeare in orations the high excesse enthusiasmes raptures and commanding beauty of expressions are here found for although gesture naturally floweth out with the voyce yet comelinesse and beauty are the decent issues of apt motion which appeare in a sweet delivery anticipating the eare by the eye
and to speake seriously this artifice of the hand is no lesse necessary to excellent discourses and conceits then discipline among souldiers without which courage is of no effect and valour most commonly proveth unprofitable they therefore who in publicke and before those who are versed in the art of welspeaking fall short in manuall performance

suffering the glory of eloquence to receive diseminution in their hands do no lesse then cast an aspersion upon the art they professe and abuse their hearers since no speech ought to be publique if you intend to performe it negligently and not to allow it all the ornaments whereof it is capable for the polishing whereof wee need not go far since the hand is able to accommodate the tongue in such occasions as that which hath a greater variety of synonymous expressions and is able to outvie it in equivalent variations
this is sufficiently proved by the old emulation between that famous oratour cicero and roscius the great· master in the art of action for it is certaine that most eminent oratour would often contend and strive avie with roscius whether he should more often expresse the same sentence in gesture or whether he himselfe by the copiousnesse of his cloquence in a differing speech and variety of expression pronounce the same which raised roscius to that height and perfection of knowledge that he wrote a booke wherein he compared eloquence with the art or science of and indeed the fame and estimation of roscius grew hereupon so great that learned made a question whether cicero could write better then roscius could speake and act or roscius speake and act better then cicero write
hence a certaine moderne authour reckoning up nine kinde of wits usuall at this day makes up his account thus imprimis

a simian or apish wit an arcadian wit an autolican or embezled wit a wit a smirke quick and dextericall wit and a roscian wit which is only in gesture when

one can farre more wittily expresse a thing by a dumbe externall action then by a lively internall invention more by gestures then jests
this was in that pantomimicall roscius who could vary a thing more by gestures then either tully could by phrase or he by his witty speeches
and as concerning such men wee may say of them as once cicero said of piso they are wise only by signes
these actors the cunning counterfeiters of mens manners were called pantomimi from their multivarious imitation their faculty ars gestitulatoria by the romans which one teletes is said to have found out or at least to have much amplified who is reported to have been so excellent in this subtill artifice of his hands that he could expresse by them whatsoever

could be spoken by word of mouth
and we read of a certaine philosopher one memphis

by name a master in this faculty whose excellencie therein when the same authour would signifie tacens saith he gestu omnia nobis manifestius indicabat quam qui artem dicendi se docere profitentur in the reigne of domitian bathillus was famous for these measures of the hand concerning whom the satyrist

chironomon ledam molli saltante batillo

saltationem manibus gesticulantis ledae representante mimo as farnaby upon the place
we read also of one mnestor a famous pantomime much

affected by caligula

cassidorus elegantly describing one of these pantomimes tunc illa sensuum manus occulis canorum carmen exponit per signa composita quasi quibusdam liter is edocet intuent is aspectum in illa{que leguntur apicesrerum non scribendo facit quod

scriptura deolaravit
monstraletus in his chronicle makes mention of a company of these

chironomons who before trinity house in paris represented the passion of our saviour without any words at all but by the mystery of gesticulations of his hands all things being very exactly and graphically acted by them
these chironomons of old being sent for from the theater to banquets carved up foules and other viands to their symphonies to which juvenal alludes

nec minimo sane discrimine refert

quo gestu lepores quo gallina secetur

hence petronius ad symphoniam gesticulatus lacerebat obsonia
and juvenal

structorem interea nequa indignatio desit saltantem vide as chironomonta volanti cultello

lipsius confounds these structores or carvers

with the chironomonts
the scene of this art as is thought lay first in syracusa and that these chironomicall expressions sprang from the immane cruelty of hieron the tyrant of that city who among other his barbarous edicts prohibited the syracusians all commerce of speech and the vocall liberty of communication commanding them to call for their necessaries by nods and significant motions of their hands eye and feete which soone necessitated them to fall into these dancing conferences and declarations of their mindes
the first man that usurped the name of chironomon or pantomime among the romans was pylades when he came out of asia an art which about the time of nero was brought to that authority and perfection that many writers both greeke and latine

as a thing most wonderfull cried it up to the skies
hence demetrius the cynique who lived in the time of nero seeing one of these pantomimi dancing the masque of mars and venus

vlderis ipsis manibus loqui

or as lucian hath it non agere sed arguta manu effari

and wee read of a certaine prince who comming out of pontus about businesse to nero then resident at the head of the roman empire when

he together with others had seen this chironomon dancing so conspicuously that although he could not heare nor understand what was sung for they were all for language yet they understood all things very perfectly this prince when he was to returne home and nero had invited him with much courtesie and love and liberally bad him aske what he would at his hands promising him readily to grant his desire give me quoth he roy all sir this chironomer and with this gift you shall highly pleasure me nero demanding what that fellow might advantage him in his affaires at home have quoth he most sacred emperour many barbarous neighbours differing in language to understand whom need a great number of interpreters which are not easie to be had therefore when shall stand in need of an interpretour this man by significant motions of his hands shall interpret all things unto me
and concerning these artfull gestures of the hand and loquacity of the fingers we must understand many passages of the ancient poets and philosophers
thus is

that of claudian to be understood

qui nutu manibus{que loquax

and that of sydovins apollinaris

clausis faucibus loquente gestu

to this also belongs that of petronius

puer manu loquaci

and what another speaking of this art hath

egressus scoenam populum saltator adorat solerti pendet prodere verba manu
pugnat ludit amat bacchatur vertitur adstat illustrat verum cuneta decore replet
tot linguae quot membra viro mirabilis est ars quae facit articulos voce silente loqui

the poet here saith very aptly articulos loqui for that these pantomimi did not only delight in gestures of the hand but more especially in motions of the fingers
theoricus king of italy called this musicam mutam still musicke quae ore

clauso manibus loquitur quibusdam gesticulationibus facit id intelligi quod vix narrante lingua aut scripturae textu posset agnosci
to this appertains

that of st cyprian vir ultra mulierum molliciom dissolutus cui ars sit verba manibus expedire
and that of seneca mirare solemus scoenae peritos quod in omnem significationem rerum affectuum parata

illorum est manus verborum velocitarem gestus assequitur
but of all that have touched at this

art most wittily cassiodorus hic sunt additae orchestarum loquacissim manus linguosi digiti silentium clamosum expositio tacita quam musa polyhymnia reperisse narratur ostendexs homines posse sine oris affatu suum velle declarare
and indeed the prince of roman poets where he handles the names

inventions of the nine muses ascribes the finding out of this kind of utterance to polyhymnia

signat cuncta manu loquitur polyhymnia gestu

the learned observation of these premises made

the ancient masters of the who

used to decypher a distinct and articulate voyce by a tongue adde a hand comprehending the same to note out eloquence by that conceit implying that speech stood in need of that moist organ the tongue but pronunciation required a hand to wit an artificiall helpe to set it off and make it beautifull to the eye
and the first inventer

of the art of logique to note the moods and brevity of argumentation exhibited logique by a hand comprest into a fist and rhetoricke by an open and dilated hand which is but pugnus expansus
analogicall to this is that symboll of the cynique manus non sunt proferendae complicatae

confusis digitis which insinuates that speech should not be perplext in the delivery but should be open plaine and free for then speech labours of a blinde crampe when it is too concise confused or obscure
hence phisiognomers according to their rule ad apparentiaem infer such men to be full of words whose manners and common use it is to hold the hand spread out with the fingers
←these hand critiques observing the apparent manners of men say that he who customarily useth much action of his hand in his talke is a faire speaker and neat in his language
and that ancient interpretour of dreames in his allegoricall inferences makes the hand to signifie

reason understanding speech and languages which as it were by the conduct of letters or rather an opportune speech declares the tacit affections of the minde
ribera observes

that the hand in scripture doth not only signifie the divine suggestions of prophesie but also all kinde of speech especially wherein there

is any thing commanded and he addes the reason
quia sicut manns movet it a movet locutio praecipiens
the reasons why grave antiquity did render and understand all kinde of speech and language as pierius notes by a hand are for that the moving and significant extention of the

hand is knowne to be so absolutely pertinent to speech that we together with a speech expect the due motion of the hand to explaine direct enforce apply apparrell to beautifie the words men utter which would prove naked unlesse the cloathing hands doe neatly move to adorne and hide their nakednesse with their comely and ministeriall parts of speech and words would have but a cold lodging in the eares of the auditors if the hand should not be the harbinger of the tongue to provide and prepare the eye for their better entertainment for as words paint out the image of the minde so these suffragans of speech by a lively sense afford that shadow which is the excellencie of the vocall pourtraicture
since as these gestures of the hand alone and by themselves doe speak and shew the mentall springs from whence they naturally arise so invited by art to the aid of eloquence they become the accessories and faire spoken adjuncts of speech
hence the first artificers of manuall rhetoricke hit on the right veine of oratorie when conducted by a learned curiosity of wit they tooke in hand that polite device and elegant design of reducing the usuall gestures of nature into strict rules of art preparing the undigested motions of nature and making them more formall and fit for the intention of rhetoricke whose life and force they made much to

consist in the just demeanour of the hand whose motions appeare as emphaticall to the eye as speech doth to the eare two ports of sense through which all passions finde an entrance to ceaze upon the minde
and hence such orators have ever won the prise and have had their hands crowned with the olympique palme of eloquence who have excelled in the subtill notions of this art who conceiving rhetoricke to consist most in a decent motion of the body bestowed well neare as much paines to adapt their gestures to rhetoricall significations as in the elegant disposing of their choice flowers the hands so surpassing in dignity all the other corporall adjutants of mans wit that there can bee no eloquence without them
and they perceiving that action most sway with the people who most commonly are led by sense which is moved by some adequate object that without the true knowledge of this secret of art none could be accounted in the number of good oratours that a mean oratour instructed in this knacke of action did oft excell the most eminent they bent their whole endeavours for the attaining this quality
demosthenes who deserves the sirname of chirocrates for his active judgement in these rhetoricall endeavours he was wont to compose the action and gesture of his body by a great and for further acquaintance with this faculty he entertainned andronicus the by whom being instructed in this art after he had reformed the defect that was before in his orations for want of action he grew very famous for eloquence insomuch that aeschines the oratour

who in a discontent left athens and came to keep a schoole at rhodes and begun to teach the art of rhetorique when he otherwhiles read

unto the rhedians and that with action and gesture the oration he had pronounced against ctesiphon when all the hearers marveiled thereat and namely how possibly he could be cast if he acted such an oration you would never wonder at the matter quoth he my masters of

rhodes if you had been in place and heard demosthenes and seen the vigorous sharpnesse of his eyes the terrible weight of his countenance a sweet voyce accommodated to every word and the efficacious motions of his hand and body
this art was generally practised by all the eminent oratours of athens unlesse perchance in that sad and solemne session of the areopagites where when they were to speak without affection in an obscure and darke place there was no cause why they should use the motio~s of the hand

among the romane oratours cicero to this intent made use of roscius the comoedian and aesope the tragaedian in his time the masters of this kind of learning who was wont to call roscius for his great skill in these subtleties of the hand delicias suas his darling and upon a time in a most eloquent oration he rebuked the people of rome because while roscius was acting they made a noyse
what an apt scholler he proved and what his opinion was of this art appeares by his book de oratore wherein he so highly extolls action the practice whereof help'd to intitle him to the principality of eloquence
plutarch relating the force of cicero's eloquence by reason of the sweet grace

of his pronunciation reports him in his oration

pro ligario so marveilously to have moved caesar one that could well skill in manuall rhetorique that he changed divers colours and shewed plainly by his countenance that there was a marveilous alteration in all the parts of him
for in the end when he came to touch the battaile of pharsalia then was caesar so troubled that his body shooke withall and besides certaine bookes which he had fell out of his hands and he was driven against his will to set ligarius at libertie
therefore the malice of antonie forced teares and lamentations into the

eyes of the romans when they saw cicero's right hand the instrument of his divine eloquence with which he penn'd and pronounced the phillippiques nail'd fast unto his head and set upon the rostrum or pulpit of common pleas in the forum
cn lentulus also for his excellencie in this art was more famous then for his vocall eloquence
lentulus lentulus gracchus apuleius saturnius crassus and julius caesar were men expert in this mysterie
antonius he used the asiatique phrase in his pleadings which carried the best grace and estimation at that time full of ostentation and bravery of gesture
as for pompeius sirnamed bithynicus macer manilius sura they lost the estimation of good oratours for their deficiencie in this art
but above all most actively eloquent was hortensius the oratour one could not tell whether they should most desire to run to heare or see him speake his presence and aspect did so a dorne and become his words and assist his periods to accomplish all their

numbers and againe his verball expressions were so conformable to his gesture and so elegantly

administred unto his hand that for certaine aesop and roscius two famous actors of those times were often observ'd to croud into the assembly when he was pleading that they might by imitation transferre some of his expressive

gestures from the forum to the theater
some lawyers and divines have observed to have been very prevalent by virtue of this artifice of the hand even in these times among whom most eminent was that much lamented dr donne of whom an ingenious friend thus in his elegiack knell

yet have seen thee in the pulpit stand

where one might take notes from thy look hand
and from thy speaking action beare away more sermon then some teachers use to say
such was thy cariage and thy gesture such as could devide the heart and conscience touch thy motion did confute and one might see an error vanquish'd by deliverie

such as sconerus notes was the action of the prophets and ecclesiasticall oratours in the primitive times plainly heroique as may be collected out of sacred writ and some commentators thereon in whom the eloquence of the prophets is graphically described

nature exhorts all men to action consentaneous to the stile of their elocution which inbred and commodious propensitie unlesse illustrated by art and confirmed by exercitation is as trapezuntius notes but as a field untill'd which runs

wild with disorder'd productions
art being the imitator which perfects nature makes her actio~s more dilucid illustrious and sweet by her positive accommodations
for whatsoever nature doth institute in the individuals worthy observation reduced into one exact idea built upon generall precepts by a perpetuall order art doth expose under one aspect of the understanding and nature againe placed by art beholds the excellent actions of eminent men and expresses them by a happy exercitation
wherefore the ancient rhetoricians who cast their eyes upon nature and insisted in her steps whose art was principally bent to imitate the severall actions of the mind with a decent and comely grace admitted no gesture to the hand but what they did find by an accurate collation to have some similitude with the truth of nature
that which philostratus junior requires of a painter who would be eminent

by his hand is more necessary to an oratour
he would have him that would seeme to manage that art skilfully to be a man endued with a good fancy and a sound judgement actively apt to every thing and industrious in the observing of mens natures and assimilating their manners and counterfeiting of all things which in the gesture and composition of the body are the signes and notes of the tacite mind and affections
and indeed then shall the hand of an eloquent man move aptly and as to the purpose applyed to expresse what he takes in hand when he hath converst with nature and insinuated himselfe into all the veines of the affections of the hand by diligent study hath attained to an exquisite experience in the properties

of the fingers and what the naturall motions of the hand are wont to be
hence philosophers who can discern of the naturall causes of things have a notable advantage for he shall most elegantly judiciously manage his hand moderate the gestures thereof who by the discipline of philosophie shall apply and conforme himselfe neerest to the nature varietie of the affections

hence demosthenes being demanded the question which was the first point of eloquence

he answered action which the second he answered action and which was the third he said action still
wherefore in the olympian games at that famous assembly of greece that theater of honour where the arts wisdome and the illustrious vertues were recompenced with publique honours there in the sight of the

people of greece after the sound of a trumpet wherewith the mindes of the standers by were rowzed up to attend the solemne commendation of the publique cryer the hands were first crowned before the head as chrysostome advertiseth

us
for when the brabutia which were most skilfull judges would declare that all the glory of the victors did proceed from the hand or action and that in the first place industry labour and skill were crowned by them not the shoulders of the triumphant olympianiceans but their hands were decked and praised with the glorious palm
skilfully therefore

ambrose palma manus victricis ornatus est
and victorie is called dea palmaris and victoriosus with isidor is palmosus
but why the palme was given to them that overcame and why the boughes thereof have been proposed as rewards

to such as were victorious in artes or armes according to that of the poet

nobilis terrarum dominos evehit ad deos

there are who alleadge this reason for that the fruit of the palme doth resemble the hand and fingers and are thereof by the greekes named dactili that is digiti fingers for the great

ends of the branches appeare like hands stretched forth and the dates as fingers
it seemed therefore right the palm should be given to them whose hands were skilfull in arts and fingers cunning in battail since the chief weight illustrious honour of all triumphs depend upon the hand or action or as if the fruit of the palm were peace
and tullie when he had unfolded all the

ornaments of a costly and copious eloquence he casts up all in the summary of these grave words sed haec omnia perinde sunt ut agu~tur implying that without a pleasing and opportune action all the other aydes of speech would become vaine and unprofitable
talaeus is in the right where he saith that many infants by the dignity of action

have often reap'd the fruit of eloquence while many eloquent men through the deformity of gesture have been accounted very babies in expression
for whereas nature assignes to each motion of the minde its proper gesture countenance and tone whereby it is significantly exprest this grace of gesture is conceived to be the most elegant and expressive virtue of the three install'd by plato among the civill virtues as the speech and native eloquence of the body for that those elegant conceptions that inrich the pregnant mind incite the minde

by some stratagem of wit to finde out apt and fit expressions and while she labours to be free in powring out her hidden treasures she imprints upon the body the active hints of her most generous conceits darting her rayes into the body as light hath its emanation from the sun which eloquent impressions a kinde of speech most consonant to the minde are in the moving of the hand so neatly wrought and emphatically produced that the hand many times seemes to have conceived the thought
he therefore that would purchase the repute of an accomplish'd rhetorician must pursue the knowledge of this art which consists in understanding the lawfull garbe and ordered motions of the hand the most puissant agent of the soule and which hath by some been called mens corporis or the minde of the body the voyce of philosophie admonishing in epictetus no lesse to be minded by a rhetorician then a philosopher

ne digitum quidem temerè extendere

some notions of this manuall rhetorique are

derived from the heroique ages of the world and were approved and allowed of by soates
yet in the dayes of aristotle were not delivered by any as digested into any forme of art which had been a subject worthy of his pen but in chirologicis dormivit aristoteles
the art was first formed by rhetoricians afterwards amplified by poets and cunning motists skilfull in the pourtraicture of mute poesie but most strangely inlarged by actors the ingenious counterseiters of mens manners
the first romane oratour that collected these rhetoricall motions of the hand into an art translating so much from the

theater to the forum as stood with the gravity of an oratour was surely quintilian unto whose

curious observation in the hand referre those who out of curiositie desire to be more punctually informed in these most subtle and abstruce notions of the hand which they may also finde recited in vosoius his rhetorique a mysterie in great request with the ancient sophisters and rhetoricians and properly handled by them although some not well advised would have them considered in the aethiques for there is distinction to be made between that which moralists call actionem moratam or civitem and oratoriam which the greekes call and quintil
chiromomiam which are acco~modated to move the affections of the auditors
and indeed the gestus of rhetoricall utterance doe presuppose the aethique precepts and the lawes of civill conversation
the ancients especially the grecians were men ever very inventive of such subtleties had a palestra or place of exercise for this purpose
talaeus preferres these canonicall gestures before the artifice of the voyce although his commentator will allow the preheminence of this art only among nations

of divers tongues and not where the assembly is of one lip
keckerman gives the voyce the dignity of precedence for our times but he is no better than a precision in rhetorique of whose conceit let the learned judge since he confesseth the jesuites known to be the greatest proficients in rhetorique of our times instruct their disciples after this manner
and how wonderfully they have improved and polished this kind of ancient learning appeares sufficiently

by the labours of three eminent in this facultie cresollius de gestu oratoris voellus de arte dicendi and causinus de eloquentia
alstedius

could wish we had some booke of the pronunciation of the ancients that we might take out of it such gestures as did square with our times such a booke as laertius praises
and schonerus wishes for types and chirograms whereby this

art might be better illustrated then by words
which defect in this art have here attempted to supply and as hope with reasonable successe
if have miscarried in any it is the more pardonable since in all my search after these subtleties of the hand never met with any rhetorician or other that had picturd out one of these rhetoricall expressions of the hands and fingers or met with any philologer that could exactly satisfie me in the ancient rhetoricall postures of quintilian
franciscus junius in his late translation of his pictura veterum having given the best proofe of his skill in such antiquities by a verball explanation thereof
that which inabled me to advance so farre in this art is the insight have purchased in the or foundation of all rhetoricall pronunciation to wit the naturall expressions of the hand

the canons of rhetoricians touching the artificiall managing of the hand in speaking
with an historicall manifesto exemplifying the rhetoricall actions thereof
canon

the hand lightly opened timorously displayed before the breast and let fall by short turnes under the heaving

shoulders is an humble and neat action becomming those who daunted and dismaid begin to speak as if their tongue were afraid to encounter with the publicke eare and such who shunning a profuse excesse of words would sparingly expresse their mindes or asswage and mitigate the censorious expectation of their auditours by an ingenious insinuation of a diminutive action

quintilian thinks that demosthenes in that lowly

and fearfull oration for ctesiphon began with his hand composed after this manner and that ciero's hand was formed to this composition of gesture in the beginning of his oration for archias the poet when he said si quid est in me genii judices quod quam sit exiguum

canon ii

the stretching forth of the hand is the forme of pleading

and hath a secret helpe and preparative to ready speaking and commendeth an apology or any set speech to the auditours

in the memorialls of antiquity in the writings of the old annales the lineaments of pictures and ancient statues we shall finde this postute of preparation in the hands of famous oratours
aristides reports that prince of oratours

to have been so painted in grece to the eternall monument of his memory stretching out his right hand only as he was wont most honourably to speake unto his people
phillip that eloquent

man was wont to say that he did so rise up to speake that hee knew not his first word yet he said he used to speake excellently well when he had once warmed his arme
and marcellinus observing the demeanour of valintinian about to make a publicke speech when he had put forth his hand saith he that he might speake more readily
that divine oratour and chief speaker of the apostles used this action as a preparative to his ensuing apologie for when agrippa had permitted paul to speake for himselfe paul stretched out the hand and answered for himselfe
this forme of pleading is to be seene in the ancient statues of roman advocates

canon iii
the indulgent putting forth of the hand towards the auditours signifying a kinde of humdnity and good will is a benevolent action fit for those who praise or congratulate and is of great efficacie to move the affections

this action had a singular grace and comelinesse in meletius that reverend bishop of antioch a man invironed with a guard of all the vertues with which action of his hand as with the engine of good will he seemed to lift up the hearts of his hearers with him therefore gregory nyssen attributes to him dextram veluti lenocinio orationis perfusam qua cum

or is facundia digites commovere soleat

canon iv

the gentle and hand throwne forth by a moderate projection the fingers unfolding themselves

in the motion and the shoulders a little slackned affords a familiar force to any plaine continued speech or uniforme discourse and much graceth any matter that requires to be handled with a more lofty stile which we would faine fully present in a more gorgeous excesse of words

the comelinesse of this action which best suites with them who remove shift their standing appears herein that by this emanation of the arm and delivery of gesture speech is so well pronounced and powred forth that it seems to flow out of the hand

canon

the hand directed towards the auditours with a kinde of impetuous agitation of the arme maintaining its gravity with a swift recourse

is an action of vehemencie fit to denounce reprehend and and by its extension implies power and a prevalent authority

this action is not seasonable untill an oration begin to wax hot and prevalent and the discoursing appetite of the hand be rowsed up and well heated by a rhetoricall provocation and is sufficiently affected to move according to the nimble contention of the tongue
and then this glittering dart of speech like lightning or the shaking of apollo's beams expatiates it selfe into a glorious latitude of elocution the oration with this militarie gesture as it were powring out it selfe
the left arme if any thing is to be done with it is to be raised that it may make as it were a right angle

canon vi
the hand restrained and kept in is an argument of modesty and frugall pronunciation a still and quiet action sutable to a milde and remisse declamation

this action with tully is molli brachio ageres with fabius articulo gladiatorem vehement is impetus adversarii mollis articulus excepit
and in the primitive times of elocution when eloquence began to flowre and bud and insolencie was rarely entertained
oratours were wont to keep their hands within their cloaks for so as aeschines will have it those ancient oratours

princes of greece in most account both for their language and judgement pericles and themistocles were wont to declame as an action most sutable to conserve their modesty
and he fetcheth his argument of so laudable a custome from the statue of solon which the ancient statuaries skilfull in the counterfeiting mens maners made for solon at salamina in this posture to note his moderation and modesty with which signification there was the like statue long after his time erected at rome for scipio
and verily aeschines who approved of this posture of the hand as an index of moderation he observed it himselfe even in the heat of reprehension and reproofe but this animadversion of aeschines who spitefully carped at the important gestures of the hand the oratour demostheues did afterwards most elegantly deride and explode for that statue of solon saith he the salaminians say was not dedicated above fifty yeares agoe but from solon to this present time are two hundred and forty yeares so that the who expressed that gesture no not his grandfather were then alive
but it cannot be denied that such a thing might be with the ancients which aeschines knew rather by conjecture then any certaine assurance for we read of one polemon a

deboyse young man who upon hearing of xenocrates became modest and drew his hand within

his cloake
and the gravest writers report of cleon that turbulent oratour of athens to have

been the first that opened his cloake in speaking
this rationall conceit prevailed also with the romans for although in the ancient statnes of lawyers in rome we finde the right hand put forth the forme of pleading yet the first year they were called to the bar they were not to put forth the hand nor a young advocate permitted to plead after the same manner as an ancient practitioner
cicero hath left a certificate of this custome nobis olim annus erat unus ad cohibendum

brachium constitutus ut exercitatione ludo{que campestri tunicati uterentur which garbe of the restrained hand as it is an argument of frugall pronunciation the great prelates of rome observe at this day when they speake before the

pope as that great master of the hieroglyphiques testifies
but when wit which lay asleep in those rude and simple times began to be rowzed up and instructed with arts those streights of bashfulnesse were inlarged the hand released and set at liberty and a more freer course of pleading brought in not that modesty should be excluded mens manners which is a great ornament of life but that speech might have a greater force to worke upon the affections of men
now to use this fearfull demeanour of the hand were the part of one void of common sense and humanity against whom that of quintilian might be brought who reprehended

those who in pleading inhibited the hand as if the businesse were done sluggishly

canon vii
the hand put forth and raised aloft is an action of congratulatory exclamation and amplification of joy

this is drawn from nature into the schooles and discipline of rhetoricians who prescribe

this free and liberall motion of the hand as a fit of gesture upon such occasions and most consonant to the intention of nature

canon viii
the hand collected the fingers looking downewards then turned and resolved is a set form accommodated to their intention who would openly produce their reasons
the artificiall conceit of this action is that it seems as it were indeed to bring forth with it some hidden matter to make the argument in hand more rhetorically apparent

canon ix

the hollow hand raised above the shoulder with

some kinde of grave motion of the wrest doth cheere exhort embolden and encourage

canon the palme the fingers all joyned together turn'd up and by the return of the wrest in one motion spread and turned about with the hand is an action convenient for admiration

canon xi
the hand the fingers all joyned at their tops referred to the vocall passage of the minde doth lightly admire and fits their occasion who in the interim are moved with sudden indignation and in the end fall to deprecate amazed with fear

canon xii
the turned up hand the thumbe bent in and the other fingers remisse transferred to the northern side of our body and then prone to our south side so lightly waved to and doth very aptly distinguish contraries and may the variety of numbers

canon xiii
the hand after one sort is not still disposed to aske a question yet commonly when wee demand however it be composed we use to change or turne our hand raising it a little upwards

canon xiv

the hand erected and then so moved that the inside is turnedout

is a sensible action that apparently presents the least disparity or difference

canon
xv
the hand that by alternate motions contracts and unfolds it selfe doth aid them in their pronunciation who are very instant to urge a thing

canon xvi
the turning of the hand may serve to signifie an easie dexterity of performance

this is a magistrall notion raised upon this principle that the hand is so borne to action and so prompt to expedite all accounts of signification that nothing seems more easie then the motion of the hand
hence the greeks very ingeniously call that which is proclive and easie to be done undefined span alphabet as if it were no more difficult then to stir the hand for the ancient greeks call the hands undefined span alphabet
hence manus non verterim the adage pro eo quod est nihil omnino laboro a forme of speech used by apuleius
the carthaginian ambassadour used this adjunct of demonstration

to andromachus at the city tauromenion for in his bold speech wherein he threatned in the name of the carthaginians to make quick dispatch to the overthrow of tauromenion he shewed first the palme of his hand then the back of his hand threatning him that his city should be so turned over if he did not quickly send

away the corinthians andromachus turning his hand up and downe as the ambassadour had done bad him be going and that with speed out of his city if he would not see the keele of his gally turned upwards
this action as it is expressive to the easinesse of performance is canonicall enough but as a demonstration of the cities or gallyes overthrow it is apochryphall

canon xvii
the hand brought to the stomacke and spread gently thereon is a gesture of rhetoricall asseveration

but whether it be convenient to touch the breast with the hand the sonnes of rhetoricians have made enquiry in their learned disputations some would have the hand to be onely turned and so referred to the breast others say we may touch the breast with our fingers ends both in the opinion of cresollius may bee done without reprehension when we speake any thing concerning our selves and that our speech glydes with a calme and gentle streame
but the touch doth most availe in a sharpe and inflamed

stile when the motions of the minde are by action unfolded as when an oratour would expresse an incredible ardour of love lodged in his bosome and cleaving to his very marrow or griefe deeply setled in his yearning bowells in signifying these and such like affections none can rebuke an oratour if he shaltouch his breast with his fingers ends only
cresollius makes little doubt but tully used this gesture when he said

miserum me for in such occasions the splendour of pronunciation is lacking neither have words sufficient force to make the minde altogether intelligible unlesse the hand be brought to the breast

canon xviii
the shewing forth of the hand or beckning with the same are rhetorically significant to speake to call after invite bring in and warne to come

tullie in the epilogue of his oration for plancius

which did abound and overflow with lamentation very commodiously explain'd himselfe by this rhetoricall compellation where with most excellent artifice he call'd plancius and bids him come unto him that he might touch and imbrace him
cresollius rather prefers the first action to the hand of an oratour and would

have invitations signified by putting forth the hand onely without any waving motion for that beckning with the hand in his judgement is the propertie of an unskilfull multitude and of men of small account who want gravitie and moderation who doe not onely induce and apply their to this perswasive behaviour but doe also revoke and bow back their whole body and wind and wrest about their very sides who though he doe not forbid or repudiate this calling gesture of the hand alone yet if the body be drawne in withall he would have it referr'd to the stage and to places of common resort

canon xix
the hand rais'd stretched out with the arme or the hand waved towards the auditors are adva~tageous actions for them who would imply a generous confidence and their authoritie and abilitie to effect a thing it serves also to call for and demand silence and for the prologue to an act of pacification

this canon is grounded upon the axiome in nature that there does appeare in the hand

as twere a naturall marke of the majestie and authoritie of man
hence ovid in this rhetoricall sense attributing a majesticall gravity to the hand of jupiter

postquam voce manu{que

murmura compressit tenuere silentia cuncti

substitit clamor pressus gravitate regentis

and statius speaking of the action of jupiters hand in a councell of the gods advanc'd to the same purpose

don pater ipse sedendi

tranquilla jubet esse

hence aelian of jul aug

manu semper cos placare cuperet

but though the hand onely put forth and advanced with authoritie is of force to asswage tumults and procure audience as domitian in statius dextra vetat yet if a certaine kinde of motion be there withall exhibited it will be of more force and dignitie which undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet words which the greekes use in this case doe import
herodians phrase is undefined span alphabet the proper word in this businesse is undefined span alphabet the greekes also say

undefined span alphabet with greg
nyss
tis undefined span alphabet others undefined span alphabet some also undefined span alphabet almost in the same sense although this last seems to signifie something lesse onely the lifting up of the hand
verily cornutus upon perseus grants as much magna saith he profutura hominibus locuturi tacere

jubent moventes manum
see the naturall gestures gest
xvi for examples of oratours using this action

canon xx
the hand propellent to the the left shoulder brought forward the head inclined to the southward of the body is an action accommodated to aversation execration and negation

canon xxi
to shake the hand with bended browes doth abhorre deny dislike refuse and disallow

canon xxii

the hand resilient or leapeing back to the

northward of the body whence it did descend makes an action fit to abominate and to accompany words of refusall or dislike and may serve also in point of admiration

canon xxiii
the hand with a gentle percussion now greater now lesse now flat now sharpe according to the diversitie of the affections is fitted to distinguish the comma's breathing parts of a sentence

canon xxiv
by his hand referr'd unto him an oratour may shew himselfe when he speakes any thing concerning himselfe

caesar used this patheticall demonstration of himselfe when one accused brutus unto him

and bad him beware of him what said he againe clapping his hand on his breast thinke ye that brutus will not tarry till this body dies

canon xxv

the hand bent into a fist and the pulpit or barre strooke therewith is an action of rhetoricall heate and very artificially

accompanies anger and a more vehement contention

canon xxvi
the palm strook upon a book held usually in the left hand of an orator doth serve to excite and rowze up the auditours
this action is commonly used by our moderne oratours and hath succeeded in the place of smiting upon the thigh which cannot well be performed in our deep and little pulpits

canon xxvii

to clap the hand suddenly upon the breast is an actiof increpation proper in their hands who would arrest their speech and it by silence and by a carefull stop restraine their tongue and call back as it were their reprehended words put in a rhetoricall demur

or crosse bill against their owne declaration

to this action that of homer appertaines

pectore autem percusso animum increpuit

sermone

canon the hand brought unto the stomack in a remisse garb spread thereon doth conscienciously assevere becomes them who affirme any thing of themselves

canon xxix
the breast stricken with the hand is an action of griefe sorrow repentance and indignation

this is a very patheticall motion in nature rhetorical in art and action in use with the ancient oratours and with a profitable signification practised by the jesuits who are wont not only with a light approach to touch the breast but sometimes also to beat upon it with the hand which they doe for the most part to testifie anguish of minde repentance and matters of

mortification which they acte and personate with such substantiall abundance of speech with such motion of the body and such imminent gesture that while they beat their breasts they raise oftentimes great motions in the minds of their auditors and religious teares are drawne from the eyes of many
which rhetoricall action of the hand is not alwaies to an inch framed by the precepts of rhetoricians nor by line and levell fitted to the rule of art nor weighed as twere in the goldsmiths ballance for they who assume this gesture strike their breast with an audible stroake when they judge it fit for their purpose although some who are more studious of eloquence doe not heartily admit of this loud contact of the hand who with a peaceable meeknesse bringing the quiet hand unto the breast by the forcible atchievements of that pronunciation procure a dreadfull influence to fall upon their auditory
but in a senate of the learned and a solemne assembly of venerable personages a vehement percussion of the breast is not convenient but is to be remitted to the theater lest as my author

saith some stripling in eloquence should tacitely throw at them that out of the comoedie

hic pectus digitis pultat cor credo evocaturus foras

canon xxx
the forehead stricken with the hand is an action of dolour shame and admiration

quintilian grants this to have been used by some turbulent oratours in their pleadings even

in his time and very availeable with them who by a popular ostentation of eloquence hunted after the applause of the people
his words are these jam collidere manus terrae pedem incutere femur pectus frontem caedere mire ad pullatu circulu faciunt
yet oratours of very good esteeme by their practice commended the use and signification of this gesture but in epilogue onely and a certaine fiery amplification when for the moving of passion these tragicall expressions of the hand are held comely and convenient
a gesture with the greekes and latines of equall use and signification as farre as our understanding can light us to the knowledge of those rhetoricall ornaments of expression in fashion with the ancients
and it was wont to attend upon three causes to dolour shame and admiration
in great griefe they thought it of old a very expressive demeanour of the hand
cicero commendeth it in brutus
dionysius halicarnassensis acknowledgeth

the use of this gesture percutientes frontes aspectus tristes prae se ferentes
cicero insinuates as much to his friend puto te ut frontem ferias
livie calls this affection of the hand capitis offensationem omnes offensare capita
with curtius it is os converberare is tum caepit os converberare non ob suam vicem
in apuleius the gesture stands thus dextra frontem replaudere
the greeks say undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet
hence heliodorus of his old man cum feriisset frontem
and libanius

of the persian king caput identidem percutiens deplorat and we read it to have been the forme of lamentation used by the spartans at their funeralls
but of this dolorons adjunct of discontent and angry symptome of grieved nature tullie in a kinde of medley of naturall invasions and rhetoricall impressions of the hand upon

the assailed body makes this rehearsall pectoris feminum capitis percussio
that this gesture was used in signification of shame chrysostome declares who when he had upon a time with an incredible force of utterance rehearsed divers impious and

ridiculous superstitions observed by some of the people he made the whole multitude of his auditors ashamed
of whose shame he puts down three visible arguments in words sounding to this effect vultum operuistis frontem percussistis ad terram inclinastis
this undefined span alphabet in another place hee expresseth in his owne

language thus undefined span alphabet
that it was significant in wonder and admiration appeares by nonnus a great poet who attributes this gesture

to admiration in his paraphrase of the sacred historie of john where of nathanael wondring at the doctrine of our saviour

undefined span alphabet
prae admiratione frontem divina manu feriens

hannibal used this adjunct of expression as a stratagem at the battaile of who when giscon a man of like state and nobilitie with told him that the enemies seemed afar off to be a great number hannibal rubbing his

forehead answered him yea said he but there is another thing more to be wondred at then you

thinke of giscon
giscon straight asked what mary saith he this that of all the great number of souldiers you see yonder there is not a man of them called giscon as you are
this merry answer delivered contrary to their expectation that were with him looking for some great weighty matter sutable to his gesture made them all laugh a good

this gesture although it was with these senses admitted the hands of the ancients yet it appeares to cresollius in the possibilitie of a doubt whether or no it can now with any advantage

be done it being little used by advocates and the more judicious sort of men that speake in publique unlesse perchance by such who are of a more hot complexion and are apt to boyle over with a sudden motion whose choler in the seething bubbles into action for men of this temper soone moved as having a naturall inclination to anger in the vehement fervencie of passion hastily and swiftly with the hand touch the forehead or cap which action because there manifestly appeares in it the virtuall effect and commotion of nature it commonly escapes the lash of reprehension
but faintly and childishly apply'd and more of schoolartifice then the intentionall operation of nature it is condemned as feigned and adulterate for which reason my author concurres in opinion with quintilian and adjudgeth it worthy of banishment from the hand of an oratour and

to bee consined to the theater and the ridiculous hands of mimicks
unlesse it seeme good to any to reserve it as a relique of divine courtship which they report the to

doe who in their churches at their holy mysteries are wont to beat their with the hand

canon xxxi
the thigh smitten with the hand was the gesture of one pleading more vehemently of one grieved and fuming with indignation of one taking notice of an others errour or confessing himselfe deceived

tullie believed that action of an oratour

feighned who in some grievous matter deserving the sharpest hate and heaviest indignation did not use this expression for he calls callidius a cold and dull oratour and argues his guilt from hence that in his oration ne{que frons percussa foret nec femur
the first oratour that used this gesture

by the testimony of the old annales was cleon who when he pleaded in athens that famous mansion of the muses transported with a certaine vehemencie and provocation of spirit and moved with indignation smote his thigh which when he had vented with other such like signes of a fierce and turbulent disposition many wise men thought him to have thrust all decorum and ible moderation out of the pulpit this many afterwards did imitate at the first thought ill of for the novelty but in the use of common life

very frequent
this gesture prudently and with good advice exhibited hath a cunning force to amplifie and enlarge a thing and to shake and astonish the minds of the auditours
scopelianus a man of greatest account for eloquence as philostratus hath delivered it to posterity that he might

rowze up himselfe and his auditours now and then used this patheticall demeanour of the hand this as it was oftentimes necessary in the forum so very fecible in those large pewes where those that were retained in causes did plead but in our times and the manner of pleading which we now use it is neither so frequent neither can it so commodiously be done but another thing hath succeeded in the room thereof which the writings of the ancients are silent in for the advocates eagerly beat the bar with their hands and sometimes so madly and importunately that the standers by heartily wish their hands qualified with some chiragracall prohibition
this blemish and infirmity of the hand hath crept also into holy places and there are many preachers found who with an inconsiderate rashnesse shake the innocent pulpit while they wax warme and conceive a vehement action to excell
this action as it is least unseemly when the wicked deceits and notorious dishonesties of men are called in question so used without judgement it argues a turbulent and furious motion of a vaine minde and dulls the auditours

canon xxxii

the left hand thrust forth with the palme turned

backward the left shoulder raised so that it may aptly consent with the head bearing to the right hand agrees with their intention who refuse abhor detest or abominate some execrable thing against which their mindes are bent as a distastefull object which they would seem to chase away and repell

with this action these and things of the like nature are to be pronounced

haud equidem tali me dignor honore talem terris avertite postem

canon xxxiii
the left hand explained into a palme obtaines a forme of perspicuity
these two last canons are exceptions against the generall maxime of quintil
manus sinistra nunquam sola gestum facit

canon both the turned out palmes bent to the left side is a more passionate forme of detestation as being a redoubled action

canon xxxv
both hands objected with the palmes adverse is a adjunct of pronunciation fit to helpe the utterance of words comming out in detestation despite and exprobration

canon both hands extended forth the palmes driving out to both sides doubles the action to all the same intents and purposes of aversenesse

canon both hands clasped and wrung together is an action convenient to manifest griefe and sorrow

canon xxxviii
both hands dejected make supplication more canonicall

canon xxxix
both hands a little or farre shew the manner and abundance

canon xl
both hands extended out forward together is an action commodious for them who submit invoke doubt speak to accuse or call by name implore or attest

with this action are such as these to be set off to the best of utterance vos albani tumuli at{que

luci vos inquam imploro at{que obtestor and that addubitation of gracchus quo me miser conferam

quo vertam in capitoliumne at sanguine redundat an domum
the same emphasis of action is required to that of cicero tu ex edito

monte latialis jupiter cujus ille lucos nemora sines{que saepe omni stupro scelere macularat

canon xli
both hands lightly smitten together is convenient enough to expresse a certaine anxious and turbulent heat of cogitation of an oratour that cannot sufficiently explaine his minde or doe as he would
cresollius conceives that infringere articulos that qintillian speaks of as an elegant and comely action in the hands of the ancient rhetoricians and so commendable that they used it as a manuall introduction to their orations was no other but this action

canon xlii

the hands gently set together by a sweet approach causing a low sound by their

light encounter or complosion make an opportune cadence of action to attend the close or period of a sentence

this action was commended by the practice of proaeresius that accomplished oratour of old time the master of brave speech and grace in ready speaking who publickly pleaded his cause at athens to the great admiration of all men of whom one of his auditours eunapius thus speaks proaeresius orditur flumen quodaam orationis singulos periodos pulsu manum finiens

canon xliii
both hands smitten together with a certaine kinde of gravity doth affirme with rhetoricall asseveration

canon xliv
both the palmes held respective to the body declare benevolence

canon xlv
both palms held averse before the breast denote commiseration

this action with this signification have observed in some ancient painted tables the hands of cunning motists
and verily without the knowledge of the naturall and artificiall properties of the hand as franciscus junius well observes

it is impossible for any painter or carver or plastique to give right motions to his works or hand for as the history runnes and ascribes passions to the hand gestures and motions must come in with their accommodation
the notions therfore of this hand may bee of good use for the advancement of those curious arts

canon xlvi
the hands addrest to both sides are well disposed to satisfie or to request

canon xlvii
if both hands by turnes behave themselves with equall art they fitly move to set off any matter that goes by way of antithesis or opposition

canon

vve may use likewise the advantage of both hands when wee would

present by some ample gesture the immensity of things some spaces far and wide extent a great number almost infinite large affections or when the voyce is reiterate by conduplication

canon xlix
both hands modestly extended and erected unto the shoulder points is a proper forme of publicke benediction for the hands of an ecclesiasticall oratour when hee would dismisse his auditours

it was the custome of the hebrew divines to

observe this decorum in elevation of the hands for solemne benediction
and the romanists who in matter of ceremony much emulate the externall devotion of the jew in all their extensions and elevations of the hand which they use in blessing keepe them within these prescribed bounds not that there is any mystery in this point only the elevation of the hand declares that we have chosen heavenly things according

to origen and the extension or spreading out of

the hands signifies the effectuall force of prayers as basil expounds it
tertullian therefore regulating the hands in this rite to a decencie of motion would have them temperately and modestly erected whereupon it seems to me the papists conforming their rubrique to the jewish talmud limit the priests hands not to overtop or exceed the distance of the shoulders
this solemne action according to some modern expositors implies the solemnity of a presentation of the auditours to god in prayer and doth denote unto them gods favourable goodnesse

protection and spirituall benediction desires god to confirme the blessing given who opens with his hands and fills all creatures with his blessings and seems to wish the accomplishment of all that is comprised in their manuall vote
that priestly blessing or solemne benediction with which the priests under the law blessed the people was apparantly uttered and pronounced by this advancement of gesture because they could not lay their hands on all the congregation they lifted them up onely to the shoulderpoints

the ordinary forme that was then in use was to impose the hand which could not be done with any decent expedition and this the levites conferred face to face from the place where they stood
such a solemne benediction was that where with melchisedech is said to have blessed abraham when he met him in his returne

from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him
the like was practised by the hand of aaron when he lift up his hands towards the people and blessed them
and symon the high

priest the sonne of onias in finishing the solemne service lifted up his hands over the whole congregation of the children of israel to give

the blessing of the lord with his lips
the people bowing themselves that they might receive a blessing from the most high
the forme of which solemne benediction the psalmist gives us lift up your hands to the sanctuary and praise the lord
the lord that hath made heaven and earth blesse thee out of sion
for thus the levites used to praise the lord and blesse the people
spirituall benediction having been ever accompanied with this sacred manifesto of the hands
hence we finde it observed that among the hebrewes of old when the priest blessed the people they used to erect three fingers to wit the thumbe the index and middle finger by which number of their fingers they tacitely implyed a secret of the trinitie
blessensis seemes to allude to this action of the hand
his

benedictionibus sacerdos alios benedicens protrusas ante vultum suum palmas utrasque tenebat
cum vero dicebat dominus quod hebraico illo trino uno nomine exprimebant tres digitos priores id est policem indicem medium utrius{que manus rectum altius erigebat dicto it domino digitos remittebat ut prius
addit statim quid per trium digitorum elevationem melius quâm trinitatis

excellentia mysticè intelligi potest a qua scilicet vera plena benedictio
a gesture of the hand used in the same sense and signification by the pope at this day who when he is carried upon mens shoulders in solemne procession with the same posture of his right hand and number of his fingers bestowes his canonicall

benedictions upon the people onely waving them into a crosse
buxtorfius sayes

that the moderne jews at the feast of their passeover when the priest at the end of their prayers blesseth the people he extends and spreads abroad his hands and fingers which they call chumim whereupon schechina or the glorie and majestie of god doth rest upon the hands of the priest wherefore they give a strict charge that none of the people presume to looke upon their hands at that time unlesse he would be imitten with blindnesse
and in the feast of reconciliation when the priest pronounceth the blessing he extends out his hands towards the people the people presently hide their eyes with their hands it being unlawfull for any to behold the hands of the priest as it is written behold he stands behind the wall he looketh forth at the window shewing himselfe through the lattice

that is god stands behinde the priest and looketh through the windowes and lattices that is through the spread hands and dispersed fingers of the priest which the hebrewes cast the windowes and lattices of the

hand
the rubriques of the romish rites which seeme a little to squint this way prescribe three formes of benediction for the hands of the priest
the holding up of the hands before the breast the crossing of the thumbes and the turning the little finger towards the people
all which have their severall seasons and significations in their liturgie
our blessed saviour was a manifest observer of the naturall

forme of benediction and hath sanctified the gesture to a more divine importance
after

ascension the apostles communicating the vertue of his last benediction to in conveyances thereof used the same expressions by gesture and were famous for the effectuall force of their prospering hands their exemplary action was copied out by then successors the illustrious fathers of the primitive church whose hands preserved blessing as their lips knowledge
christians in those being devoutly ambitious of such benefits thought themselves happy when they could receive this spirituall favour at their hands

there is a story in gregorie nyssen of a deacon of the bishop of who in respect of

the wonderful strange things which he wrought by his inspired hands was sirnamed thaumaturgus
which deacon being to goe a long and adventurous journey requested a blessing at the hands of his who up his hands most willingly bestowed this manuall viaticum upon him
this comfortable elevation of the hand in benediction hath a force at this day in the hands of our reverend divines and verily there is no blessing formally confer'd or authentically administred unlesse the hands denote their suffrages by their visible attendance and appeare in a due conformitie to the words ditected unto the eare
and never saw any grave or orthodox divine from the pulpit dismissing the people with a blessing without this adjunct and formall concurrence of the hands

indigitatio or the canons of the fingers
canon the two inferior fingers shut in and the other three presented in an eminent posture in the extended hand is a speaking action significant to demand silence and procure audience

the ancient oratours when they prepar'd to speake to the incomposed multitude used this

action
of which gesture of the fingers apuleius hath left a certificate where telephron porrigit

dextram instar oratorum conformat articulum duobus{que infimis conclusis digitis caeteros eminentes porrigit infesto pollice clementer subrigens
fulgentius expounds this common fashion of the hand after this manner ita{que compositus in dicendi modum erectis{que in iotam duobus digitis tertium pollice comprimens ita verba exorsus est who differ not much but that one makes the thumbe erect the other comprest
many have made mention of this matter libanius where he

describes nestor painted in the middest of the hero's orationem apud ipsos habere videbatur id{que significare conformatione digitorum but what that conformation of the fingers was he doth not explaine
but the most usuall garbe of the hand in way of preparative to speech was this of apuleius
which posture of the hand preparing the auditours attention is found in many statues of the ancients
there is a colossus at rome which in times past stood in the baines of anthony the left hand whereof leaneth upon a club but the two first fingers of the right hand extended out with the thumbe such as of old time was the gesture of oratours speaking as grutterus notes which most authenticall copie of speech they seem to have followed whose

hand the golden history of the crosse in cheap was for there were to be seene two statues of mitred prelates having their hands figured in this manner as if they were speaking to the people
and in old hangings in whose contexture most part of the historicall discourse is represented and insinuated by gestures of the hand and

in all ancient painted tables where any counterfeit of speech is exhibited nothing so obvious and remarkable as this rhetoricall posture of the fingers
and the inventions and painted histories of our moderne artists in their representations of speech had in publicke have a constant relation and respect unto this ancient forme of the fingers
and over the ancient images of the prophets which pollished by the hands of the jesuits come over to us from the mart there is usually a hand extended out of heaven impail'd about with rayes the fingers retaining this gesture as it were the index of god speaking to his prophets as he was wont to doe of old when he stirred up their hearts and suggested his sacred oracles unto them
for since they could not by any fitting semblance or fancied pourtraiture of inventive wit describe god as he is in himselfe lest impiety should have tainted their imagination and they should seeme to make the prophet equall to his god they would not by a grosse discription shadow out god speaking face to face because the face presents the person nudam divinam essentiam as brixian cleerly as he is in himselfe but hee

hath never been seen in that manner by dreame or vision of his seers nor is it possible any mortall eye should endure the infinite lustre of so great a majesty therefore to evade the prophanenesse of that presumptuous errour they only displaied a hand from heaven to that intent of signification as a more lawfull note and as it were a member more remote from the face and because the hand is the index and signe of inspiration and that divine power and impulsive ravishment

wherewith the prophets were raised up to prophesie
for prophesie if it be strong with the hebrewes it is called the hand as ribera observes

in which sense the hand of god is taken in divers places of

scripture for the prophets used to call that spirit the hand of god which fell upon them when he did inspire their disposed soules and heating them with the ravishing influence of a prophetique fire by a terrible illustration filled them strangely full of his revealed will
cornelius a lapide affirmeth himselfe to have seen the like description of the prophets in the ancient bibles of the vatican library and in his comment upon the four greater prophets

he hath prefixed to their prophesies their severall effiges after the same manner which as it is probable were copied out of the vatican bibles

canon ii
the thumbe erect the other fingers gently bent in is a convenient composition of the hand for an exordium and to lead to the forming of the other actions of the hand oft used by our modern chironomers

canon iii
if any thing be to be shewed the thumb must be bent in the other foure fingers remisse

canon iv
the index joyned to the thumbe the other fingers remisse is another forme of the hand fit for an exordium

canon the middle finger applied unto the thumbe the other three let loose is a fashion of the hand most of all commodious for a proem

this action must be performed with a gentle motion to both sides the hand a little put forth the head together with the shoulders with a shrinking modesty regarding that part to which the hand is carried
in narration the same gesture but a little more produced and certaine in exprobration and arguing sharpe and instant for in these parts of an oration it is put forth longer and appeares in a larger extent
which should bee the best rhetoricall figure of the

hand to frame it to expresse by art what it cannot so well insinuate by nature neither by the use and practice of experienced and eloquent men that now are nor by any advertisement of the ancients can be certainly collected since they differ much about the matter some pronounce with the unfolded hand these holding it downwards others contract it and make thereof a fist some frame their action by the fourth canon some by the fifth canon which quintilian commends above all other formes allowed to be of any moment to set a glosse or vernish upon discourse
so many oratours so many varying and different formes of speaking
but cresollius whose judgement is oracular in

such matters conceives that posture best observed by an oratour that when hee pronounceth with the open hand held abroad and set at liberty he would not hold it wholly down nor altogether upwards but in a certaine meane which as it is according to the opinion of physitians most naturall as he notes it out of the two grand patriarchs of physicke so it seemes

to him most easie and agreeable to modesty although this ought to be in common use yet upon occasion the hand may fall into the other postures

canon vi

the two middle fingers brought under the thumb is an action more instant and

importunate and doth urge more then is convenient for an exordium or narration

canon vii

the top of the moved to joyne with the naile of the thumbe that's next unto it the other fingers in remitter is opportune for those who relate distinguish or approve
tis also fit for them that mildly councell and becomes the phrases of pompous elocution with which rhetoricians polish and enrich their orations
tis seasonable also for narrations and panegyriques where a soft pellucid oration flowes with the copious streames of eloquence and it

availes in any painted kinde of speech and agrees with an epidixis

cresollius commends this composition of the fingers as most comely of all others and consonant to ingenious dispositions if the arme be extended out which best agrees with a manly and couragious speech or the arme a little bent and the hand lifted up before a gesture much affected by elegant men

canon viii
the two last fingers drawn to the bottome of cytherea's brawny hill or the pulpe of the thumb the thumb apprest unto the middle joynt of the two next if the dexter hand so form'd doe smite with a light percussion on the sinister palme it doth conspicuously distribute digest the numbers arguments and members of an oration

canon ix
the top of the thumb joyn'd to the middle of the naile of the right index the other fingers remisse is fit to distinguish contraries

canon the left thumb prest downe by the index of the right hand doth urge and instantly enforce an argument

canon xi
the top or grape of the left index gently apprehended puts the hand into a rhetorical shape for disputation

canon xii
the middle joynt of the left index apprehended intends more earnestnes and sublimates the sense of words unto a point of greater vehemencie

canon canon xiii
the upper joynt of the index apprehended the two next fingers a little bowed the in the meane time scarce bent at all hath a rhetoricall force in disputations

canon xiv
the prest to the palm and the others at their own behest makes the hand competently apt for to upbraid

canon xv
the two bent inward and their extremes presented in a fork doth object a scoffe and doth contumeliously reproach

canon xvi

the or thumb extended out with the the other fingers drawn

in doth denote amplitude

canon xvii
the thumbe that presents it selfe upright out of a righthand bent into a fist is a grave masculine action fit to advance the sense of magnanimitie

canon xviii
the thumbe turn'd out by a received custome is made an act of demonstration

canon xix
the three last fingers contracted close to the palme and compress'd by the champion of the hand and the index display'd in full length upbraides is a point of indigitation most demonstrative

the force in this indicatorie action antonie

noted crassus to have skilfully used to his purpose

in expressing his earnest griefe and the vehement affection of his minde quae me hercule crasse cùm te tractantur in causis horrere soleo tanta vis animi tantus dolor oculis vultis gestis digito denique isto tuo significari solet
other very excellent pleaders imitated this notable gift of nature or exquisite endeavour and affection of art in that wealthy oratour as we may gather out of the monuments of the ancients
to whom saith cresollius thus speaking we may cry out as seneca reports a oratour

once did in a certaine declamation of his digitum multa significantem

canon xx
the index erected from a fist doth crave and expect attention and if mov'd it doth threaten and denounce

canon xxi
the index advanced from a sist and inclin'd respective to the shoulder hath a great facultie to confirme collect and refute

this seemes to be that action which tertullian sayes hermogenes was wont to use to wit

nutu digiti accommodato and he calls it lenocinium pronunciationis
indeed this action can doe much in gathering together and reciting the

matter to be debated and concluded by reason to wit when that we take up from others is such as cannot be denyed and doth seeme necessarily to follow especially in controversies and disputations when the falsitie of erronious opinions are with great gravitie of speech and asseveration refuted in which case cresollius dares pronounce that of phrynicus in the comoedie

stimulum aculeum quendam habent in

digitis

canon xxii
the jndex the rest compos'd into a fist turn'd down perpendicular doth urge inculcate and drive the point into the heads of the auditours

canon xxiii
both the indexes joyn'd and pyramidically advanc'd doe exalt the force that flowes from more splendid and glorious elocution

canon xxiv

both the indexes with a countenance averse directed

to one side doe point out an ironicall intention

this action although it may with honesty enough be done by an oratour yet to doe it often and to charge them strongly and vehemently against them that are present as if he would dig out the eyes of his auditory cresollius makes a question whether such may be thought lesse out of their wits then that miserable matron hecuba who with great force and violence flew upon polymnestor

digitos in lumina condit

or ever a whit modester then cleodemus qui intento digito zenothenidi oculum effodit in convivio for this is rather the garbe of those who rage

and rave like mad men then of those who with understanding and moderation exercise the faculty of the hand in speaking

canon xxv
the middle finger put forth and brandish'd in extent is an action fit to brand and upbraide men with sloth effeminacie and notorious vices

this action is magistrall in rhetorique but grounded upon nature for this finger as some

chiro crittiques was for its sloath and unactivenesse placed in the middest as seeming to stand in need of the defence of the other neighbouring fingers and being longer then the rest length and lazinesse going usually hand in hand it may helpe to relate in a more open way of expression the notoriousnesse of their vices who exceed others in vildenesse as far as this idle finger appears eminent above the rest

canon xxvi
the middle finger strongly comprest by the thumbe and their collision producing a flurting sound and the hand so cast out is an action convenient to slight and undervalue and to expresse the vanity of things in searching after which things and the immoderate care of keeping them the industry and strength of most mens wit are impertinently exercised and spent

cresollius though he give a tolleration to this knacking adjunct of expression yet he would have it sparingly used and adds in an assembly of the people for in the solemne session of learned and judicious men this action perchance as taken from the sceane and hands of mimiques is to be rejected and left unto the customary levity of men

canon xxvii
if the ring finger by a single action goe out of the open hand as it were to serve the tact it may much advance their utterance who in discourse touch and handle a matter lightly

this is a magistrall notion of my owne never thought on by any ancient or moderne rhetorician for all can finde unlesse

quintilians interim quartus oblique reponitur darkely allude unto it but grounded upon the same principles of observation as all their precepts of gesture are
galen saies this is the finger we use to put out when we would touch any thing lightly and the ancient physitians used

gently to stir their cordialls and collyriums with this finger thence called medicus upon which ground of nature was induced to cast in my mite into the treasury of this art

canon the eare finger appearing erect out of a bended fist doth by that action obtain a force to explaine more subtill things

canon xxix
the right index if it goe from finger to finger to note them out with a light touch it doth fit their purpose who would number their arguments and by a visible distinction set them all on a row upon their fingers

hortensius the oratour was wont after this manner to set his arguments all on a row upon his fingers but although he excelled in this way of numbring and dividing arguments upon his fingers yet others used that fashion also the fingers having been devoted after a certaine manner for the numbring of things by an universall and naturall custome as we may learne out of st hierom for he speaking of a

certaine smatterer in learning swollen with a conceit of his owne skill cum caepissit in digitis partire causam
and tully significantly to

the same purpose quid cum accusationis tuae membra dividere caperit in digitis suis singulas partes causae constituere quintilian denies gesture admittance to the hand in a mournfull cause perchance because it seems to have a certaine splendour and elegancie of artifice ansi de morte silii sui vel injuria quae morte sit gravior dicendum patri fuit aut argumenta diducet in digitos aut propositionum ac partitionum captavit leporem this gesture of the hand is not to be used unlesse the distinctions and distributions be substantiall and weighty being things of great moment which we desire should fix take deep impression in the mindes of men and of which we are accurately and subtilly to dispute for in this case it is advantagious to use the fingers
it seems probable to cresollius that tully used this gesture when he made mention to the romans of the honourable

captaine in whom he did note these foure notable things scientiam rei militaris virtutem autoritatem faelicitatem which he afterwards amplified distinctly and particularly with a most high and rich variety of utterance
this numeration by the fingers doth likewise availe in an epilogue and anachephalasis as when we reckon up all the chiefe heads and aides of a matter in question which have been brought in and alledged for the advancement of truth or which have been evidently refuted or proved
hence in the areopagetique schooles or at athens they painted chrisippus with his fingers in this posture for the signification

of numbers and our moderne artists when they would exhibit arithmeticke counting observe the same gesture of the fingers
such a statue of arithmeticke there is in the new ovall theater lately erected for the dissecting anatomies in hall in london

canon xxx
to lift up or put forth some of the fingers is a plaine way of rhetoricall arithmeticke fit to signifie a small number a simple action serving well enough their occasions who would inculcate two or three chiefe points to an ignorant multitude

roscius made use of this arithmeticall intimation instead of speech when he rose to speake against the lawes gabinius had propounded for pompeyes authority against the pyrates for

when he could have no audience and that hee saw he could not be heard he made a signe with his fingers that they should not give pompey alone this authority but joyne another unto him while he was signifying this by the gesticulation of his hand the people being offended with him made such a threatning upon it that a

crow flying over the at that instant was stricken blinde and fell downe among the people
then roscius held not only his

tongue but his hand also
this is most properly performed by the fingers of the left hand
cresollius commends this way of numeration in the hands of our moderne divines
so some of the fathers when they did expound the mystery of the sacred trinity they lifted up three fingers of the right hand
but this simple way of computation hath been entertained since the ancient manner of account hath growne somewhat out of use
for the ancient rhetoricians who lived in that age wherein wit and industry were in their prime taking their hint from nature by an accommodation of art reduced all numbers into gestures of the hand which did represent as it were the lively images of numbers and this art of manuall rhetoricke was so punctually observed by the ancient rhetoricians that it was accounted a great absurdity and disparagement to them that erred through a false and indecent gesture of computation as appeareth plainly by quintilian who gives in this testimony

thereof in causis actor si digitorum incerto aut indecoro gestu computatione dissentit judicatur indoctus
and apuleius reprehends this in ruffinus the lawyer for that by a deceitfull gesture

of his fingers he added twenty yeares whose words alluding to the same arithmeticall expressions run thus si tringinta annos per decem dixisses possis videri pro computationis gestu errasse

quos circulares debueris digitos aperuisse
quin vero qua quae facilius caeteris porrecta palmula significantur ea quadraginta tu dimidio non

potes digitoru gestu errasse nisi forte triginta annorum pudentilla ratus cujus{que anni consules
this manuall arithmeticke was much in use with the ancients as appears by the frequent allusions to it in authenticke authours the knowledge whereof will bring much light to many obscure and difficult places which occurre in divers old writers which cannot be understood without the knowledge of this manuall arithmetick
to trace it a little through the gloomie

walks of antiquity
thus seneca numerare docet me arithmetica accommodare digitos

pierius in affirmation of this artificiall way of account brings in a facetious epigram of one nicharchus a greeke poet jesting at cotyttaris an old hagg who dissembling her true age began againe to number her yeares upon her left hand
the epigram rendred by him in latine runs thus

many

of these numericall postures of the fingers are found in the statues of the ancients
witnes that image of janus with two faces dedicated

in the capitoll by king numa the fingers of whose hands were in such sort fashioned and formed that they represented the number
which are the dayes of the whole yeare by which notification of the yeare he shewed sufficiently that he is the god and patron of times and ages
pierius endeavours to represent the posture of his fingers by a verball description
and it was the custome to place the ensignes of honour on the more honourable hand and to

figure the left hand of oratours and other great men to note out the first second or third time of their accesse unto that office or dignitie

these postures devised by a happy dexteritie of wit were recorded among the aegyptian letters or hieroglyphicks as unfit to be prostituted to the vulgar in regard they did allude to all the pythagoricall secrets of numbers insomuch as the caveat of pythagoras might have been placed over the of the ancients nemo arithmeticae ignarus hic ingrediatur
and the notions of this art are not onely necessary to oratours but to all men especially the sonnes of art although by the carelesnesse and negligence of men it is growne somewhat out of use
in the practice of this art some follow bede others embrace a more probable way of account

the apochrypha of action or certaine prevarications against the rule of rhetoricall decorum noted in the hands of the ancient and modern oratours
praevaricationu sect

to use any grammaticall gestures of compact or any snapping of the fingers or amorous intimations invented by lovers of old is very unsutable to the gravity of an oratour
the naturall discourses of the hand being so plaine to be understood the ancients assay'd to finde out in the hand a more close private way contriving by a close compact how men might signifie their mindes a kinde of speaking used by such who would not openly expresse themselves yet in a

dumb wary kinde of signing intimate their intention an art first found out and exercised by lovers when with great caution they would present their affections and make their fingers convey a message from their heart
of these cautionarie notes of lovers ovid that grand master of love knacks and amorous expressions affordes us many touches

nil opus est digitis per quos arcana loquaris

and in another place

in digitis litera nulla fuit

and againe glancing at the same grammaticall expressions he saith

vos

excipite arcana verba notata manu

and instructing his mrs in the way of tacit conferences

verba legis digitis verba notata mero
cum tibi succurrit veneris lascivia nostrae purpureas tenero pollice tange genas
si quid erit de me tacita quod mente loquaris pendeat extrema mollis ab aure manus
cum tibi quaefaciam mea lux dicamve placebunt versetur digitis annulus us{que tuis
tange manu mensam tangunt quo more praecantes optabis meritò cum mala multa viro

and to this kinde of amorous discourse by speaking

signes that of his refers

ut{que refert digitis saepe est nutu{que locutus

to which propertius also alludes

aut tua quum digitis scripta silenda notas

to this is referred that which ennius speakes of a certaine impudent companion who had no part of his body free from some shamelesse office or other his words are these quasi in choro pila

ludens datatim dat sese communem facit alium tenet aliis nutat alibi manus est occupata aliis pervellit pedem aliis dat annulum expectandum a labris alium invocat cum alio cantat attamen aliis digito

literas
and salomon alluding to these kinde of expressions he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingers
sometimes the ancients did to this purpose of secrecie and private communication order an alphabet upon the joynts of their fingers which artifice of arthrologie obtained a privy force by shewing those letters by a distinct and grammaticall succession
amongst which grammars by gestures the postures of the fingers which appertaine to the old manuall arithmeticke have been contrived into an alphabet of which way of intimation baptista porta hath treated at

large
to the same intent the naturall and rhetorical postures of this hand may be reduced into mystique alphabets and be very significantly used for cyphers without any suspicion
sometimes of old they used for a light a snapping collision of the fingers called crepitus digitorum which imperious way of silent expression the phrase whereof is used for a hyperbolicall diminitive of the least signification
lyra

in his learned descant upon the proverbs harping upon this string the unthrifty and wicked man instructeth with his fingers saith digito loqui arrogantiam superbiam indicat
and st hierom in a certaine epistle saith superbiae est signum cum quis per digitorum crepitum vult intelligi
the notification and sound of this arrogant gesture was reckoned among the nocturnall and darke signes of lovers
masters

also by this snapping of their fingers used to call their servants upon the hearing of which watchword they were to be presto and at hand to execute their dumbe commands
to this custome finde that of petronius referred trimalcio lautissimus homo digitis concrepuit ad quod signum matellam

spado ludenti supposuit exonorata ille vescica
to this also belongs that of tibullus

et votet ad digiti me taciturna sonum

to which martial likewise alludes

dum poscor crepitu digitoru verna moratur quotiens pellex culcitra facta me est

and in another place

digiti crepantis signa novit eunuchus

which custome the christian pedagoge would have excluded from the hands of men piously affected whose minde clemens alexandrinus hath

expounded thus digiti expressi soni quibus accersuntur famuli cum sint rationis exportes significationes ratione praeditis hominibus vitandi sunt
this kinde of commanding gesture is most common to the spaniard whose humour is only a medley of arrogance and imperious pride whence he is

most commonly detested of all nations for his naturall odious desire of sovereignty over others
and the romans the ancient lords and masters of the world growne insolent by the greatnesse of their empire could well skill of this proud intimation of their fingers
for tacitus tells us that the innocencie of pallas was not so gratefull

to the people of rome as his insupportable pride was odious
for whe some of his freedmen were said to have been privie to the practice of a conspiracie against nero he made answer that in his house he appointed nothing to be done but

with a nod of his hand or head or by writing if he had much to say lest if he should have spoken unto them he should seem to have made them his fellowes
some oratours of old affected this percussion or knacking with the fingers both to procure audience to maintaine their authority and for the signification of gravity of which custome many authours make mention especially st hierom for so he hath left it written

et audet quidam ex iis adducto supercilio concrepantibus digitis eructare dicere
and in another

place speaking of that jangling fellow grunnius he hath this cum mensa posita librorum exposuisset struem adducto supercilio contractis{que naribus fronte corrugata digitulis concrepabat hoc signo ad audiendum discipulos provocans
and of this custome veleius longus is to be understood

digitorum sono pueros ad respondendum ciemus so that this gesture hath travelled from the businesse of common and individuall life into schooles auditories and for this knacke of the fingers was got in use with many so that digitis concrepare seems to have been used by the learned pro re facilima
so in the judgement of cresollius tullie disputing of his offices takes

it ita{que si vir bonus habeat hanc vim ut si digitis concrepuerit possit in locupletum testamenta nomen ejus irrepere
for this gesture was performed in entring upon inheritances they who did desire to trie their title and take possession of an inheritance they signified their minde by this percussion of the fingers which was the usuall symboll as cujacius saith for this percussio digitorum

as cresollius rightly collects is altogether the same with crepitus digitorum or digiti concrepantes

which may be very clearly gathered out of tullie where when he had said si vir bonus habeat hanc vim ut si digitis concrepuerit a

little after touching the same string he hath it thus quem paulo ante singebam digitorum percussione haereditates omnium posse adse'convertere

to clap the hands in giving praise and allowance is a naturall expression of applause encouragement and rejoycing heard in

common assemblies of people and in publique theaters which was at first according to the simplicitie of those times plaine and naturall for ovid speaking of the primitive and ancient playes of the romans saith

tunc arte carebat

but afterwards they had an artificiall manner of clapping their hands to a certaine measure or proportionable tune
of which the poet carippus

ingeminant{que cavos dulci modulamine plausus

for the applause was done with the hollow of both hands which being smitten together caused that sound which is called popismus a word altogether feigned to the similitude of the sound
the posture of this artificiall plaudite of the hands and the sound also raised from their collision philostratus most elegantly describes in the

image of comus the god of ebrietie in these words plausum etiam quendam imitatur pictura cujus maximè indiget comus
nam dextra contractis digitis subjectam sinistram ad cavum plectit ut manus cymbalorum more percussae consonae siant
the very figure of which gesture is to bee seen in the french translation of that author
how ambitious was nero of this popular approbation when he entred upon the theater to contend for the prize of harpers and kneeling shew'd a reverence to the assembly with his

hand and the accustomed also to approve the gesture of the player answered him with a certaine measure and artificiall applause
thou wouldst have thought saith tacitus they had rejoyced and perhaps for the injurie of the publique discredit
but those which

from townes farre off and from remote provinces unacquainted with dissolute behaviour came either as embassadours or for private busines could neither endure that sight nor applaud any way so dishonorable a labour but weary of their unskilfull clapping of hands and troubling the skilfull were often beaten by the souldiers placed in thick array lest any moment of time should be lost by an untuned and disproportionable crie or slothfull silence
the like applause he expected and had from the hands of his friends at home for xiphilinus reports that seneca and burrhus though lame of his hand when ever nero spake they applauded him with their

hands and vestments
the ancient sophisters were so greedy of this manner of applause in their schooles and auditories that they purchased

it having for that purpose a chorus of domesticall parasites who were ready in the assemblies at every gesture to give them this signe of approbation
this applause which nazianzen

calls canoram manuum actionem and hierom theatrale miraculum and condemned by chrysostome among the trifling and unprofitable gesticulations of the hand and theatricall gestures crept into the christian churches and was given to the divine oratours of the primitive times untill such time as it was exploded out of the temples by their grave and sharpe reprehensions
but although the ancient oratours received this token of approbation from the hands of their auditors yet they never exhibited upon any occasion such manuall plausibilitie to the people it being a gesture too plebeian theatrically light for the hands of any prudent

cresollius hath cast in his minde what should be the cause why so excellent and weighty an author should seeme justly to have reprehended this gesture for he could not altogether condemne it because in things sacred it hath been so religious and received with so great consent of all nations that the most ancient holy mysteries which vulgarly were called orgia as some grammarians will have it tooke their denomination from this very gesture of the hands
but my authour conjecturing what his meaning should be perchance saith he his intention is to reprove the action of some foolish men who

as quintilian saith hold out their hands after the manner of them who carry something or of those who as if they crav'd a salary or minervall of their auditors most unskilfully bear about their hands upwards in whom that of the

roman poet may be verified

ille cava praetium flagitat usque manu

for galen when he would expresse the hand to be conveniently dispos'd for the conteining of water that it flow not out calls this purpose of the hand manum supinam
but this would be done more unseasonably and to lesse purpose if a man by the motions of his hands should use to imitate one taking up water out of some river as he in virgil

cavis undam de flumine palmis

that which seems most probable and to come neerest the true sense of that ancient author cresollius conceives to be an intended reproofe of a certaine action incident to nice and effeminate men for in that place dio prosecutes the sinnes of voluptuousnesse and a lascivious habit of the minde

the wagging and impertinent extension of the fingers in speaking hath ever been accounted a note of levitie and folly
and such who by a certaine reciprocall motion doe ever and anon lift up one or other of their fingers visibly prolonged they seeme to trie conclusions with their hearers and to play with them at that exercise which was in use among the ancient romans who had a game or lotterie wherein one held up his finger or fingers and the other turning away ghessed how many he held up or if you will have it according to polidors relation the play was after this manner

two having first shut their hands forthwith let out their fingers naming a certaine number
as for example put forth three fingers you as many name foure you sixe so you by ghessing

kinde of indiscreet prevarication with his fingers who in spightfull and contumelious manner both in word and deed was wont every way to taunt and twit him with his folly and among other opprobrious indignities offered to his name and memory in scoffing wise he would say of him that he had left now morari any longer among men using the first syllable of the word long in which word there is couched a double sense which gives the grace unto this pleasant scoffe for being a meere latine word it signifieth to stay or make long abode and taking it thus it importeth that claudius lived no longer among mortalls
but as nero spake of moros in greeke which signifies a foole and hath the first syllable long it importeth that claudius play'd the foole no longer here in the world among men

which aeschines as some thinke did strive to imitate who in a foolish emulation of solon and by praising his hand strove to countenance his opinion of an unactive pronunciation
but from that time all antiquitie hath repudiated those for stupid and bruitish oratours of whom one may justly say

that which cassiodorus of that drunken wise man virum illum prudentissimè disserentem difficile est vivum credas quem se nec movere posse conspicias
who may be describ'd as the miserable woman in the fable turned into a stone by latona

there was no kinde of writer that did not with franke language inveigh and pleasantly scoffe at

the sluggishnesse of those orators
juvenal prettily compares them to the stumpe of hermes and

aristides was wont to say that such dull oratours

were very unlike orpheus for he as the fables report enticed and drew stones after him but they as wood and stones move no man
cresollius who hath prepared much of this intelligence

to my hand sticks not to joyne together such men who speake without action to those statues made by the ancients in the ignorant ages of the world for they had their eyes shut their hands hanging down and joyned to their sides
daedalus a cunning and witty man was the first that formed the eyes and put forth the hands so giving life and motion to all the parts with singular judgement teaching thereby the decencie thereof wherefore he is feigned to have made those statues and pourtraictures of men so excellently that they moved of themselves

such are by this customary habit discovered to be clownes and men of a most unfaithfull memorie
such men we shall sometimes see so faint and idle in their discourse that they stick in the briers and demurre in a grosse gesture of pronunciation and stricken as it were with astonishment they seeme nailed to that ill behaviour
this in old time was called agere suspensa manu

the subtle gesticulation and toying behaviour of the hands and fingers was called by the ancients gestuosa manus arguta manus and argutiae digitorum and are certaine quick and delicate motions of the fingers

such as our juglers use who performe tricks by slight of hand and by a colourable craft mock the eye
hence manus arguta are spoken of theeves whose hands doe quickly leap up and issue forth instantly vanishing out of sight a non they shew themselves and are called to every part
sidonius apollinaris very skilfully scrinia tuaconniventibus nobis ac subernantibus effractorum

manus arguta populabitur
this pratling and busie talking of the hand and chattering vanitie of the fingers by the common verdict of all discreet and knowing men hath been ever condemned for a ridiculous weaknesse in those that use it much against which the most judicious rhetoricians have entred their caveats
see that grave precept of the prince of eloquence nulla sit mollicia cervicum nullae argutiae digitorum

non ad numerum articulus cadens
that rich oratour whose wealth begot a proverb very wisely also to this purpose digitus subsequens vexba non exprimens
this genuine blemish and epidemicall disease takes hold of the hands of light and unskilfull persons and young men

who are usually too hot at hand in their expressions yet it hath been the noted and deforming propertie of some learned men who by reason of the lively force of their wit and vigorous alacritie of their spirits doe manifest and signifie their mindes with a tumultuous agitation of the whole body whose hands are never out of action but alwayes stirring and kept in play their words plentifully issuing out on all hands
hortensius otherwise a man excellent was taxed with this genuine or contracted affectation of the hand concerning whom let us heare the

report of agellius

tullie relates the same man to have used such

subtle and swift motions of his hands that he dazled the eyes of the beholders

to play fumble with the fingers in speech is a simple and foolish habit of the hand condemned by the ancient rhetoricians as an argument of a childish and minde
this with the ancients was vibrare digitis there are saith quintilian qui sententias vibratis

digitis jaculantur and the hebrew proverbe saith stultus digito the foole speaketh with his finger
wherefore it was the saying of chilo the lacedemonian inter loquendum

manus movere non debere which he spake not

of rhetoricall motions since in sparta there was scarce any man esteemed the copious elegancie of speech worth his study but his intention was either closely to carpe at this foolish toying with the fingers or else to admonish his citizens to be sparing in speech and to affect laconicall brevity and where one or two words would serve the turne to expresse their minde there would be no great need of gesturing with the hand
to this may be referred that which suetonius

reports of tiberius nero caesar whose speech was exceeding slow not without a certaine wanton gesticulation and fumbling with his fingers which with other signs were reckoned and observed in him by augustus as properties odious and full of arrogancie

to use the instead of the index in points of demonstration is much to be condemned in the hand of any man much more of an oratour
the ancient grecians noted and reproved such for witlesse dotards

tome a sure out distinguish the intervals of an oration by scanning motions of the hand certain delicate flexions and light sounding percussions of the fingers is an action condemned in the hand of an oratour called by quintilian in his prohibition against this action ad numerum articulis cadens and explaining himselfe in this matter he saith soluta oratio non descendit ad strepitum digitorum
indeed protagoras cal'd man

the measure of all things
the learned very fitly call measure the daughter of the fingers and the aegyptians used to signifie measure by a finger painted
hence the meeting and scanning of verses upon the fingers hath been a very ancient custome and it was the manner of old in the recitation of the verses of poets in the measuring and singing them to note out the intervalls and stroaks by a certain motion of the hands wherein the fingers exhibited a sound which quintilian cals digitorum ictum for he saies in meeter

digitorum ictu intervalla signari
augustin not obscurely consents to the same who attributes singing applause and percussion to the recitation of verses hence that sentence of seneca's to be taken notice of quorum digiti aliquod inter se carmen metientes semper sonant where

as cresollius observes that great guide of literatur lipsius hath corrected a place which was sound of it selfe but the fingers saith he in that measuring doe scarce sound therefore for sonant hee puts sunt yet cresollius is loath to thinke that the above mentioned place of quintilian had escaped his knowledge which confirms this ictum digitorum or sounding motion of the fingers which seneca in this sentence alludes unto so a dactyl one of the poeticall feet on which verses run they wil have to have took

denomination from the drawing in length of the finger which they very cunningly used to expresse the modulation of the instrument
but this ietus or musicall cadence of the fingers which cresollius thinkes was not usurped of old by oratours when they related the verses of anclent poets unlesse perchance of the more effeminate

of them who hunted also after delicate flexions of words though it may be tollerable for the setting off the intervalls of restrained numbers yet in free prose which fabius calls orationem

solutam to affect these subtill cadences deserves the sting of the stoique which he put out against it

to use the left hand commonly as principall in action which should be at most but accessory is the idle property of one destitute of all artifice and common notions and of one that would seem to speake in despite of the advertisements of the ancients a strange errour in the hand of orator yet observed condemned by cresollius in some pretenders to divine rhetoricke

fit only to preach before such as the children of nineveh who cannot discerne between their right hand and their left for in those things that are done in the sight of honest men it was never thought the property of an ingenious minde and one well bred to use the left hand
neither is there any cause why in the education

of children it is diligently given in charge that they feed themselves with the right hand yea nurses use to rebuke infants if happily they put forth their left which precept is drawne out of honesty it selfe and nature and hath ever beene in use with those nations who have addicted themselves to humanity and good manners
hence the aegyptians because in writing and casting account they frame their letters and lay their counters from the right hand to the left and the grecians as herodotus notes coutrariwise from the left to the right used to

gird and trump at the grecians saying that themselves doe all to the right hand which is well and honestly but the greeks to the left that is perversely and untowardly
and indeed the nomenclators seeme to have excluded the left hand from all actions of decencie and importance
the hebrewes call the right hand jamin the south the light and active hand and the left the north the obscure and darke hand much inferiour to the south
homer though hee differ yet maintaines the dignity of the right hand above the left in calling it the orient and the left the occident
the hand is so occupied in endeavouring and doing that the greeks who to the advancement of wisdome have flourished in polishing humanity and inventing names call it undefined span alphabet quòd ut magni grammatici animadvertunt undefined span alphabet
meletius saies the left hand is called undefined span alphabet quod in rebus per agendis ipsa per se claudicet oberret and that is called undefined span alphabet laevam

undefined span alphabet quod ob sui imperfectionem ab omni penè functione removetur
sometimes with the greeks it is called undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet relinquo
hence with the latines relicta a relinquo a retrò linquo and laeva it may be for that in most actions we leave it out for the same reason in the english nomenclature the left hand for that it is most usually left out
with the germans it is die linke hant quasi leigend hant id est quiescens vel cessans manus
with the italians mano flánca manus lassa and máno id est manus desiciens
hierom so attributes vertue and honesty to the right hand that will not

acknowledge a just man to have so much as a

left hand and the hebrewes and greeks ascribe the left hand to vice
who saith cresollius is so great a forrainer and stranger in the nature of man that he knowes not the right hand to be naturally more vigorous and able then the left if there be any such could produce a cloud of witnesses for his information and the chiefe authours and of antiquity trooping together under this banner the splendour of whose armes and martiall lookes shall put all ignorance to flight
aristotle in his problems filled

with incredible variety of learning saith dextrae partes corporis nostri longe sunt nobiliores sinistris multò amplius solent efficere
they who followed him in the chorus of the learned taking their hint from this their renowned principall adhere to the same opinion for plutarch totidem verbis sinistra est undefined span alphabet to omit what

apuleius censorius plinie solinus and others deliver who have given their manuall suffrage and assent unto this point
philo judaeus enquiring

the reason why the divine law in the rite of sacrifices gave to the priests the part of the oblation which they call the right shoulder sayes there is a symbolicall signification in that mystery that the priest ought to be diligent and swift in action and exceeding strong in all things
we know that commonly in

combats the left hand is it were affixed to the body manageth the shield and staying as it were at home quiet the right hand shewes it selfe forth and is occupied in doing and giving the charge
in which we may see a certaine shadow of rhetoricall motion for in speaking motion and action is proper to the right hand

onely the left remaines quiet and is scarce openly brought forth
tullie not very obscurely adviseth thus who disputing of action makes

mention only of one hand which he somewhere calls the right hand no where the left si erit sermo cum dignitate laevi dextrae motu loqui opportebit
but the most cleare interpretour of all the ancients quintilian hath brought this oracle of rhetoricians from behinde the curtaine manus

sinistra nunquam sola gestum facit and how should it make of it self a compleat action since the action thereof is more contracted infirme incomposed and out of order whereas the actions of the right are free frequent continued composed and resembling the sweet cadencies of numbers therefore hath the prerogative of eloquence in the body as being nearest the principle of motion and most apt to move and signifie
and because the left hand of it selfe is of very small dignity in pronunciation common humanity doth teach us that as a virgin shut up in her chamber it should be modestly concealed the right hand on the contrary as a most goodly scepter of reason with its force and weight doth much among men

but although this praevarication of acting with the left hand in chiefe be an errour so grosse that we cannot away with it even in picture where an imitation of speech is exprest yet there might be a quaere rais'd what toleration might be granted to such who are or ambodexters by nature or custome
and could furnish a prevaricator in chirosophie with some notions to advance with toward an excuse or apologie in the behalfe of those who

are scaevaes and scaevolaes in this point of rhetorique
for many of the ancient sages who gave themselves to the speculation of nature are of opinion that both hands are by nature equally qualified
the great oracle of physique saith utram{que in homine manum esse consimilem
and plato where he speakes of the hands with that

wit wherewith he comprehended things divine and humane affirmes parem dextra at{que sinistra vim natura fuisse concessam
and that it hapned by custome that one hand is better and the other more infirme yet custome is another nature
but goropius hath a saying to plato for this
meletius from an

exemplar argument proves dextram laeva potiorem neutiquam esse
plato the prior of all ancient philosophers where he sets forth the education of honourable childhood he would have them all in warre and handling their weapons to be like those sonnes of thunder in homer undefined span alphabet and no lesse then the scythians in battaile equally to use both hands since it seemes easie to be done
the lawes of which most acute philosopher when the interpreter of nature briefly sets downe in illustrating his learned

tractate of politie he remembers this to be one gives omnes undefined span alphabet esse oportere
since there is little reason why one hand should be idle and quiet
and commodus the emperor preferr'd

the left hand for any action and was wont to boast much that he was
we read also that ehud and tiberius were of this complexion

but although some are found more nimble and active in their left hands and some ambodexters which bartholinus imputes to a

paire of veines whereas the puissance of the right hand proceeds from a veine sine pari on that side onely yet the utmost dispensation can be granted is a connivence in common actions for in matter of speech or ornamentall gesture there can be no toleration granted to an oratour to play the ghibeonite and to sling words at his auditors out of the auke of utterance

though he can doe it at a haires breadth
for the truth is the left hand wants that agilitie excellence force and grace in point of action being made contrary and unhappy by its scituation whereupon tis called sinistra in latine quia sine astris bonis
and the lack of grace in doing of a thing is called sinisterit as and sinistrè the adverb sounds unhappily
the best way therefore that it can be imployed is in attendance on the right which by the course of nature hath the prioritie as the more proper and propense and apter to make good its actions by a more handsome diligence as being planted neerer the fountain of the blood
and verily the left hand seemes to be born to an obsequious compliance with the right
and therefore when quintilian calls for this acco~modation he seems to have had respect unto the interpretour of nature whose axiome it is ita comparata esse natura ut laeva dextris obsecundent

and the philosopher addes his reason

in another place quòd omnia sinistra dextris humidiora sunt facilius obsequi at{que ad nutum alterius fingi moveri which the hebrew divines as cresollius sayes seeme to have had respect unto in their exposition of deuteronomie about the ceremonie of washing hands where they

say thus denique opus est ut in ablutione manuum sinistra tanquam famula subserviat dextrae

hence some critiques would have the left hand called by the greekes undefined span alphabet quasi quòd egregia optima{que non sit sed ad dextrae obsequium ministerium{que procreata
and the ancient lingones called improsperous things eperistera but good and fortunate things dexia
by the greekes indeed sometimes by

way of antiphrasis the left hand is called undefined span alphabet ab undefined span alphabet optimus
but in all humane affaires sinistrum signifieth as much as unluckie

for an ecclesiasticall orator to blesse or dismisse his auditors with the left hand is a sole cisme

in manuall divinitie
for the left hand in this businesse hath onely usurped the office in the second place as being of a lower nature then the right neither is it of that fortune or reputation whence in all naturall devices and matter of forme or token of the hand or any utterance implying the freedome of election the introducing of the left hand doth abate and denotes a subordinate propertie
tis the right hand according to isidor that hath its name dando by which we understand a joyfull abundance

of all good the extension of that hand therefore hath been ever of more repute in conferring benediction
and justin martyr sayes it was an institution of the prime apostles that the right hand should confer the badge of

christianitie in baptisme for that it is more exlent honorable then the left and as cresollius thinks accompanied with blessing whereas in the left hand there is a contrary genius certainly it is found to be of a very different condition

and naturally more apt to deteine then to bestow a blessing
yet notwithstanding the left hand though it contribute little yet as in some naturall and civill actions it is conformable and obsequious to assist the right so in the more accomplish'd and plenary exhibition of this sacred rite it hath oft diaconiz'd unto the right but of it selfe alone somewhat improper and ever subordinate unto the right
hence among other prodigies happening in the time of caesar dictator which were thought to prognosticate but small happines
when certaine infants were borne with their left hands upon their heads the concluded that there was signified

thereby that men of an inferiour condition should rise vp against the more noble
and the people who relyed much upon these kinde of allegoricall inferences thought as much and believed it

certaine cavtionary notions extracted out of the ancient and moderne rhetoricians for the compleating of this art of manuall rhetorique and the better regulating the important gestures of the hand fingers
cautio

the ancient rhetoricians were very precise in the doctrine of action and had many inve~tions for the forming thereof which hapned by reason of the manners and complexion of those times but we are not to tread in their steps so far as to revoke the whole art of their obsolete rhetorique since it is not very apparent what action the ancients used and if it were known the whole and perfect discipline cannot be observed so properly now since the

times and dispositions of men now differ and oratorian action must varie according to the diversitie of people and nations in the meane time their universall precepts which may be drawn out of the ancient oratours are not to be neglected but diligently learned and as much as can be reduced to practice

cautio ii
action accomodated to perswade by an apt enumeration of utterance called by rhetoricians pronunciation divided into the figure of the voice and motion of the body whose chiefe instrument the hand is hath been ever accounted absolutely necessary for a rhetorician yet all things that the ancients prescribe for action doe not properly belong to a rhetorician neither are all things that appertain convenient for our times nor doe all actions of the hand become speech for there are some so far from advancing elocution that they render it unamiable and deformed

cautio iii
there are two kinde of actions which are more perceived in the motion of the hand than any other part of the body one that nature by passion and ratiocination teacheth the other which is acquired by art
an oratour is to observe both the naturall and the artificiall yet so that he adde a certaine kinde of art to the naturall motion whereby the too much slownes too much quicknes and immoderate vastnesse may be avoyded

cautio iv
the incomposure of the hands is to be avoided for to begin abruptly with the hand is a sinne against the lawes of speech
in the exordium of an oration the hand must not goe forth nor stand extended but with a sober and composed heed proceed to its first action it is good as rhetoricians say simulare conatum and when it first breaks forth into gesture while it is softly brought forward we may looke upon it with an eye expecting when it should supply our words wherefore when an oratour hath exhibited his honour to his auditours and laid his hands upon the pulpit let him stand upright and that without any motion of his hands or his right hand not brought forth beyond his bosome unlesse a very little way and that gently

cautio vvhen the oration begins to wax hot and prevalent the hand may put forth with a sentence but must withdraw again with the same

cautio vi gesture doth with most conformity to art begin at the left hand the sentence beginning together from the left side but is put off and laid downe at the right hand together with the end of the sentence

cautio vii
tis absurd often to change gesture in the same sentence or often to conclude sinister motions

cautio viii

gesture must attend upon every flexion of the voice not scenicall but declaring the sentence and meaning of our minde not by demonstration but signification for it must be accommodated

by the hand that it may agree and have a proper reference not so much to the words as to the sense wherfore tis added as an authentique clause that the hand must attend to begin and end with the voyce lest it should outrun the voyce or follow after it is done both which are held unhandsome

cautio ix ioyne not esau's hands with iacobs voyce

cautio to raise the hand above the eye or to let it fall beneath the breast or to fetch it down from the head to the lower belly are accounted vicious misdemeanours in the hand yet the masters of this faculty doe grant a toleration sometimes to raise the hand above the head for the better expressing of a just indignation or when we call god the courteours of heaven or the common people of the skies to witnesse

cautio xi
to avoid the long silence of the hand and that the vigour thereof might not be much allay'd by continuall motion nor prove deficient there is a caveat entered for the interposing of some intervall or pause as twere a measure of the expression or stay of the active elocution of the hand some that are skilfull and curious in this matter would have three words to make the intervall of every motion in the hand
but quintilian condemnes this for too nice a subtilty as that which neither is nor can be observed

cautio xii

no gesture that respects the rule of art directs it selfe to the hinder parts yet otherwhiles

the hand being as it were cast backe is free from this prohibition for whereas there are seven parts of motion to the right hand to the left upwards downwards forward backward and circular the first five are only allowed a rhetorician

cautio xiii

take heed of a hand solecisme or of transgressing against the rule of action by the incongruity of your hand and speech for to speake one thing with the tongue and to seem to meane another thing by a contrarient motion in the signifying hand and so to thwart and belie a mans selfe hath been ever accounted a grosse absurdity in rhetoricke and the greatest solecisme of pronunciation
which makes to this purpose wee read how at the olympique games which in times past were celebrated at smyrna where polemon that skilfull sophister was present there enters the stage a ridiculous player who when in a tragedy he had cried out undefined span alphabet coelum he put forth his hand to the earth and againe pronouncing undefined span alphabet terra

erected his face towards heaven
the learned sophister laughed at the absurd actor withall alow'd so that all were neare might heare him undefined span alphabet hic manu solaecismum admisit wherefore being president of those games he by his censure deprived that rude and ignorant mimique of all hope of reward
for reconciling of the hand and tongue and bringing them to an uniformity of signification and for maintaining their naturall and most important relations rhetoricians have agreed upon many canons and constitutions
and the hand then

only accords and complies with speech when it moves to verifie our words for if the motions of the hand doe dissent from the expressions of the tongue it may contradict and convince the tongue of vanity for so we may commend even when we doe reprove if the gainsaying hand should have a contrarient motion seem to confirme when we are in doubt when we forbid our hand may deport it selfe into the forme of an exhortation we may acquit when we accuse accept when we refuse and abhor comply in words yet by our disordered hand bid defiance be sad with a rejoycing hand affirme and grant what we deny and many other waies thwart and belie our selves
no true construction can be made of any speech nor can we evade such dull absurdities of this voucher of our words do move in opposition to their meaning for without judgement and advice which should set in order and support the thought into the hand that is ever ready to maintaine that trust that the tongue endeavours to obtaine truth wants her warrant and is so absurdly crost that the efficacie of speech is utterly defac'd and all the credit that such language amounts unto is the pittance of a doubtfull faith

cautio xiv

shun similitude of gesture for as a monotone in the voyce so a continued similitude of gesture and a hand alwayes playing upon one string is absurd it being better sometimes to use a licentious and unwarrantable motion then alwayes to obtrude the same coleworts
cresollius sayes he once saw an eminent man one

who had a name for the knowledge of honest

arts and indeed there was in the man much learning and that of the more inward recondit a great antiquary and one that had a certain large possession of divine and humane lawes goodnesse of words soft and pellucent and decked with flowers adorned and polished with the sayings of wise men and a speech flowing equally after the stile of xenophons but it can scarce be imagined how much the ill composed and prevaricant gestures of his hands tooke off from the common estimation of his accomplished wit for when he had turned himselfe to the left hand he powred out a few words with little gesture of his hands then reflecting himselfe to the right hand he plainly did after the same manner againe to the left hand strait to the right hand almost with the like dimension and space of time he fell upon that set gesture and univocall motion his hands making circumductions as it were in the same lineall obliquity you would have tooke him for one of the babylonian oxen with blinded eyes going and returning by the same way which for want of variation gave an incredible distaste to his ingenious auditors which did nauseat that ingratefull saciety of action if he might have followed the dictate of his owne genius he would either have left the assembly or given him money to hold his peace but he considered there was but one remedy that was to shut his eyes or to heare with them turned another way yet hee could not so avoid all inconvenience for that identity of motion entring at his ears did disturbe his minde with nodious similitude

cautio xv
take care that variety of gesture may answer the variety of the voyce and words which that it may be better done foure things are to be observed first see to the whole cause whether it be joyfull or sad then look to the greater part for in an exordium a gentle motion is most commodious
narration requires the hand a little spread and a quick freer motion
confirmation a more sharpe and pressing action the conclusion of an oration if it be composed to excite must have rowsing motions if to pacifie gentle and sweet if to sadnesse slow and short and broken motions if to joy liberall cheerfull nimble and briske accommodations
then the sentences are to be weighed which vary with the affections in expressing which diligence must be used
last of all the words some whereof are now and then to be set off with some emphasis of irrision admiration or some other signification yet those gestures which fall from the slow hand are most patheticall

cautio xvi
take heed of levitie and a scrupulous curiositie in a pedanticall and nice observation of these gestures of the hands and fingers

cautio xvii
shun affectation for all affectation is odious and then others are most moved with our actions when they perceive all things to flow as it were out of the liquid current of nature

cautio xviii
vse some preparation and meditate beforehand of the action you intend to accommodate your voyce with

cautio xix

although an orators art should not altogether consist in imitation yet remember that imitation is one of the great adjutants and chief burnishers and smoothers of speech it having been an ancient and laudable custome for ingenious sparks of oratorie to be present at the declamations of eminent oratours studiously to observe their countenance and hand
plinie dislikes those that imitate none but are examples unto themselves
the same plinius secundus a famous

pleader and most sweet orator among others that applied themselves unto him had fuscus silinator numidius quadratus
junius also commended to him by his ancestours was trained

up in the examplar doctrine of manuall gestures
hence the tribe and nation of oratours were called by the name of those eminent men which they did imitate
sidonius truly sirnamed apollinaris call'd those frontoneans who did imitate fronto a famous philosopher and oratour the patterne of eloquence to antonie
so the followers of posthumus festus were called posthumians
sulpitius not the least in the chorus of elegant men imitated the hand of crassus that nightingall of the forum the glory of the senate and as tullie sayes almost a god in speaking of whom that it seemes might be spoken with small exchange of words which was hyperbolically said of herods eloquence non manus hominem sonat wherein

he was so happy and industrious that he was accounted to be very like unto him

cautio xx

basil the great a grave and perfect oratour a man accomplish'd in all kinde of humanitie which in him had a sacred tincture of pietie when he had beene acknowledged to be to vertue he had not only admirers but some that strove to be his imitators

therefore nazianzen a man of a most

sharpe judgement sticks not to call them statuas in umbris a kinde of hobgoblins and nightwalking spirits who did nothing lesse then aemulate the splendor of rhetoricall dignitie
take heed therefore that imitation degenerate into and of proving a cicero

cautio xxi vvhen you have judiciously proposed your patterne keep close unto it without levitie or change for diversity of copies is the way to mar the hand of action
titanius junior was famous for this vice who as capitolinus saith was the ape of his time
the same levitie or facility of imitation libanius the sophister had who was called by those of his times the very painted map of mens manners and dispositions

vse exercise
for as the most learned of the

iews there are three ideas nature art and exercitation by which we endeavor to the best end
the corinthian oratour much commends this exercitation
and the oracle of the graecian sage is omnia sita sunt in exercitatione
the absolute perfection of all arts is from thence and from it eloquence receives her beauteous colours her musive or mosaique excellency whereby shee becomes most accomplished

bend and wrest your arme and hands to the right to the left and to every part that having made them obedient unto you upon a sudden and the least signification of the mind you may shew the glittering orbes of heaven and the gaping jawes of earth
sometimes place your arguments upon your fingers sometimes lifting up your hands threaten and denounce punishment or with a rejecting posture abominate sometimes shake and brandish your hand as the lance of elocution that so you may be ready for all varietie of speech and attaine that undefined span alphabet or facilitie of action with the decorum beauty of decent motion which excells both that of colours and proportion
charmides a goodly young oratour when he would compose his gesture to all kinde of elegancie

and as ovid speakes numerosos ponere gestus that is acurate and made neat by a subtle judgement at home alone undefined span alphabet he practised the gesticulations of his hand

cautio xxiii

to have censors at times of exercise who shall informe truly and skilfully of all our gestures would much helpe to the conformation

of the hand
or to practice in a great looking glasse for though that mirrour reflects that image of one hand for another yet we may beleeve what we see to be done
demonax a great philosopher and an acute rhetorician advis'd an untoward declamer to use more exercise and while he answered that he alway first acted his orations to himself demonax replied that may very well be for you act so little to the purpose

because you have alwayes a foole to your iudge

cautio xxiv
the gestures of the hand must be prepar'd in the mind together with the inward speech that precedes the outward expression

cautio xxv vse no uncomely or irregular excesse of gesturing with your fingers in speaking nor draw them to any childish and trifling actions contrary to the rules of decorum and to that they serve for lest you diminish the glory of faire speech and rhetoricall perswasion and offer a great indignitie to minerva to whom these organicall parts of elocution were sacred

cautio xxvi
the left hand of it selfe alone is most incompetent to the performance of any perfect action yet sometimes it doth but very rarely
most commonly it doth conform accommodate it selfe to the right hand
and where both hands concur to any action they exhibite more affection
wherefore undefined span alphabet in the duall is masculine cause vis unita fortior

cautio xxvii
both hands doe sometimes rest and are out of action yet this rhetoricall silence of the hand is an act proper where no affection is emergent though a long intermission of gesture be displeasing

cautio xxviii
avoyd knackings and superstitious flexures of the fingers which the ancients have not given in precept

cautio xxix
the actions of the hand are to bend that way that the voyce is directed

cautio take heede that while your hand endeavours to accomplish the acts of rhetoricall pronunciation you lose not modestie and the morall and civill vertves nor the authoritie of a grave and honest man

cautio xxxi
in all action nature beares the greatest sway every man must consider his own nature and temperament
the reason is because no man can put off his own and put on anothers nature
one action becomes one man and another kind of behaviour another
that which one does without art cannot wholly be delivered by art for there is a kind of hidden and ineffable reason which to know is the head of art
in some the civill vertues themselves have no grace in others even the vices of rhetorique are comely and pleasing
wherefore a rhetorician must know himselfe yet not by common precepts but he must take counsell of nature for the framing of the complexionall and individuall properties of his hand

cautio xxxii

in the rhetoricall endeavours of the hand as in all other actions the golden mediocrie is best and most worthy the hand of a prudent man
for the action of the hand should be full of dignitie and magnanimous resolution making it a liberall and free index of the minde such as theirs is who are said by xenophon to be inspired with divine love who as he sayes gestus ad

speciem quandam maximè liberalem conformant
which forme of apparence consists in a certaine moderation of gesture no chafed and incomposed rashnes or a too daring garbe of action nor superfinicall demeanour nor on the other side a rustique and homely fearfulnesse which is wont to discourage and disappoint the purpose of necessary motion
yet of the two extremes it is least faulty to draw nigh to modestie and an ingenuous feare than to impudencie
the manner and tempering of gesture is not onely to be fetched from the things themselves but also from the age and condition of the oratour for otherwise a philosopher or some grave person otherwise a young sophister lifted up with study and boyling over with the fervencie of an active spirit
a soft and calme action most commonly becomes grave men endued with authoritie which to one in the flower of his youth would be accounted slownes and a slacking negligence
modification of gesture hath also regard to the condition and qualitie of the auditours for an oratour should first consider with whom and in whose presence he is about to act for in the senate or hearing of a prince another action is required than in a concion to a congregation of the people or an

assembly of light young men
among kings and potentates and fathers of the court regard is to be had to their illustrious power authority all juvenile gestient pompe and ostentation laid aside by a submisse action he must transferre all dignity from himselfe
concerning this golden point of moderation there is a nationall decorum imposed upon men by time and place for according to the genius of that climate wherein we converse moderation may admit of a divers construction
in italy a faire spoken and overmuch gesturing with the hand is held comely and acceptable
and in france he is not a la mode and a compleat mounsieur who is not nimble in the discoursing garbe of his hand which proportionable to that language is very briske and full of quicke and lightsome expressions
and your french protestant divines are easily good chirologers some have lately seen in the pulpit to my great satisfaction and have gone away more confirmed in the validity of these rhetoricall gestures there being scarce any one gesture that have cut but have seene used in the heat of one discourse of polemicall divinity such logicall asseverations appeared in their hands
in germany and with us here in england who in our nationall complexion are neare ally'd unto the germans moderation and gravity in gesture is esteemed the greater virtue
the spaniards have another standert of moderation and gravity accorded to the lofty genius of spaine where the hands are as often principalls as accessories to their proud expressions
but our language growne now so rich by the indenization of words of all nations

and so altered from the old teutonique if the rule of moderation be calculated according to the meridionall proprietie of our refined speech we may with decorum and gravitie enough as suppose meet the hand of any of these warmer nations halfe way with the manuall adjuncts of our expressions

chirepilogus
thus what my soul's inspired hand did find t'exhibite in this index of the mind what nature or her subtle zanie can by signes and tokens reach with speeches span while many hands made lighter work at last brought to the nail hath crown'd the labor past
here my hand's genius bids my fancie stand and having her discoursing gestures scan'd beckens lest for a manuall unfit the work should rise to make a hand of it
manum de tabula

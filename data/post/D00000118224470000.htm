am no pimp nor champion for a whore to usher puncks or in a taverne reare the wrongs of all good women would right am your champion and for you ile fight my sword and pen your honours shall maintains saluting you rest yet still remaine

the admirer of your vertues a
the good womans champion or a defence for the weaker vessell
gentle reader or hearer know it is a hard taske to please all fancies and am as certaine there are many snarling criticks in this age that willout of their malicious wisdomes give a harsh censure on this ensuing subject which if they do care the lesse because the matter which write of is honest and in defence of harmlesse and vertuous women

therefore when considered the manifold aspersions bitter taunts envious revilings slanderous raylings and malignant writings of some inveterate spirits which would be accounted men against poore harmlesse silly and weake women who are not able with that little péce of flesh called their tongue which is their chiefe defence or weapon to expresse or otherwise to vindicate themselves in writing the injuries and scandals daily divulged abroad in fantastick pamphlets verses as the of women the parliament of women the the gossips meeting the lecture vinegar and mustard and know not what for all these and more are spightfully fomented

against that noble sex of matchlesse immaculate creatures whose deserved worth to illustrate and set forth cannot either with speech or in writing
those men say whose tongues are like a sword their pens made of goosequils their inke of galls and their braines adled who hath neither charity wisdom or modesty they surely forget that ever they came of a woman or had a mother who under god first gave them life nourished them in her body brought them into the world with paine and like the pelican fed them with her own blood and bred them with care industry such men may very fitly be compared to the viper that destroyeth the wombe that bare them and we all doe know that ingratitude is a monster and she which brought forth such an abortive birth into the world was surely delivered before her time

a woman was the most beautifull and rare péce of architecture that ever was erected upon the face of the earth and framed by the best workman in the world for when she was first created or borne she was not a childe or infant but a perfect and compleat woman neither was she made of base earth or clay as man was but of the purest of her husbands flesh and blood being a rib taken out of his side and next of all to his heart and therefore in my opinion it is against nature nay against the law of god to abuse or hurt the same being their own flesh and blood as too many do which

is much to be lamented but herein the old proverb is truly verified that the weakest still goes to the walls and a low hedge is soon stept over
therefore you satyricall antagonists and others that so bitterly enveigh against poore women if you would be pleased but to view the sacred scriptures where you may find sufficient proofe that they ought to have more due respect allotted them then some of you will acknowledge or professe they should enjoy and although man be the head and is or ought to be endued with more wisdome and strength then a weak woman yet he ought not to triumph over or injure so harmlesse a soul without whom man by no means can subsist for did not god say of adam in the creation it is not good for man to be alone and further god saith will make him an helper meet for him therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
thus you may perceive how necessary is the swét society and company of a vertuous woman to her husband for she is his helper at all assaies being carefull of her family képing him neat and decent both in woollen linnon and other necessaries cleanly in dressing his dyet and a loving nurse to him both in sicknesse and health wherefore a man ought to love his wife above all the world they being as the lord saith one flesh

if you will heare what st paul saith of a woman it is thus a woman is the glory of

man
and solomon the wisest of men saith a vertuous woman is a crowne to her husband now if a woman be a glory to her husband how is that man blest which enjoyeth such a wife who doth crown his heart with variety of content she like the fruitfull vine bringeth forth swét children which are the blessings of god being the fruit of their owne loynes who preserveth if the lord please their fathers name to the end of the world by their posterity and the wise man further saith who so findeth such a wise obtaineth favour of the lord
ten thousand times happy is that man that with a wife can obtain such heavenly favour but solomon further addeth that the price of a vertuous woman is far above rubies and let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe and be thou ravisht alwaies with her love

it is the common custome now adaies among most men to hearken after wives with a great portion rich friends never regarding how she is qualified or whether she be addicted to vertue or vice but wealth is the chiefe mark at which they ayme sometimes they hit the white they shoot at yet come hom by wéping crosse but a poore woman be she never so vertuous is not regarded with them but you have heard her price and how high a rate the wise man doth velue her at yet for all this though a good woman be as loving as the hind and pleasant as the roe to her husband séking by all means possible she can to please him either

with kinde and loving spéches or pleasant and modest behaviour there are some froward men like churlish naball that are never contented with whatsoever she doth or sayes when a kind and loving husband would think himselfe blest to enioy such a treasure be ravisht with the love of such a wife
if you will be pleased to heare what st peter doth say for wives it is thus husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessell being heires together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered
these words are to shew husbands that there should be a kinde of loving duty by them allowed to their wives and that they should live and dwell together in civill and discreet knowledge and not with wrangling discord and envie for a wise man will give honour to his wife above all women for many respects first because she is his wife and it may be hath horne him children then as she is a woman and a christian likewise he is to beare with her imbicilities if she have any because she indeed is the weaker vessell for god hath ioyned them together as one body that they should both be heires to inherit the grace of eternall life for where man and wife doth live in unity and peace their prayers no doubt shall be heard

st paul writing to the ephesians saith thus husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himselfe for it
and in

another place he uttereth these words husbands love your wives be not bitter against them
could heartily desire that some unkind husbands would take notice and hearken to those words of the blessed apostle with what a tye he doth perswade and exhort them to love their wives which would almost move a stone to heare and could with them to mark with reverence and to take it to their heart of whom he speaketh and his comparison which is the church for he coniureth them by no lesse then christ the blessed son of god our saviour and redeemer who gave his life for us to redeeme our sinfull soules from hell and damnation this is a deep yet a sweet perswasion to love
the apostle also exhorteth husbands not to be bitter to their wives but there are too many now adayes that will not hearken to his counsell but will use the words of solomon who sayeth thus a contentious man is apt to kindle strife and hatred stirreth up contentions but love covereth all trespasses

this saying of the wise man methinkes should quell those foolish mens follies which utter and write such invectives and fantastico revilings taunts and iests against women for these are those wicked spirits the devills agents which soweth discord and breedeth contentions kindling the coles of strife hatred and disdaine in divers families betwixt man and wife never perswading to peace love or unity which should hide and cover all domestick

iarrs or trespasses and they make as though a woman were but as a meere cipher and stood for nothing but let them know thus much that a woman is worthy of a far better respect for she is the vessell of eternity and is or ought to be the closet or cabinet of a mans heart his summum bonum or his all in all his chiefest secretary or his second selfe for as it is said they are one flesh yet some snarling criticks there are who wil not blush to say that unto a woman we should reveale no secret or that they hardly ever hoard or read of a discrét vertuous or wise woman
to answer them in brief amongst many let them but looke into the first of samuel where they may finde it written thus

abigall was a woman of good understanding but her husband naball was churlish and evill in his doings
now if she had not bin a woman of wisdome understanding david had slaine her husband and every one of his servants for his family was great which abigall for her wisdome david did marry after her husbands death
also in the second of samuel you may read how a wise woman saved the city from destruction when it was besieged by joab
likewise did not holefurnes and his servants marvell at the wisdome of judeth and she afterwards saved the city when he had besiedged it by cutting off his head
also boaz said to ruth all the city of my people doth know that thou art a vertuous woman
and was not susanna a vertuous woman that would rather suffer death then yeeld to the vitious and wicked

elders many more proofes may be obiected against those envious and standerers of that worthy sex for a woman was the vessell of the holy ghost which nourished in her wombe and brought forth into the world the redéemer of mankinde our blessed saviour christ iesus also did not divers women follow christ and ministred unto him being present at his death to whom he appeared at his resurrection and did not pilates wife her husband to have nothing to doe with christs death

having thus briefly written of some vertuous good and discréet wives women think it not amisse to say a little in defence of vertuous virgins and maids in the
of deut it is said that they are to be punished that bring an evil name upon a virgin and in cor
it is thus if a virgin marry she hath not sinned and was not jepthas daughter of israell a vertuous virgin who willingly submitted her selfe for a sacrifice to fulfill her fathers vow and did not christ compare the five wise virgins to the kingdome of heaven but amongst other virgins me thinks should not bury in oblivion the memory of our famous countrywoman elizabeth late quéene of england
who for her time was accounted the phenix of christendom and admired for vertue and wisdome throughout the world she kept her land in peace and her forreigne enemies in awe she was truly religious for which the lord ever blessed her to her end and thus much ile of her inspight of envious detractors she

dyed a good woman and a virgin queen

thus have in brief related some passages and collections out of the sacred scriptures in defence of good vertuous and barmlesse women but if there be any that will not beleeve the same let them heare what st paul saith unto them vnbeleevers shall not enter into everlasting rest
and now in my opinion it is unchristian uncharitable and immodest for any man so bitterly to enveigh and write against a woman which naturally he should love cherish and honour for many respects as is before said above all the creatures in this world
must confesse that the conditions and humours of some fantastick men are fickle various unconstant they are double tongued and false hearted they will protest and say one thing and meane another as too too many good women have found by wofull experience for when they sue for love oh what dissembling teares feigned sighes déep protestations solemn vowes large promises and flattering speeches will procéed from their dissembling lips now many a gentle and woman and maid hath compassionated and pittyed their crocadilian teares and beléeved their periurd vowes which oftentimes hath procured their sorrow for when such false men have obtained their desires they grow carelesse and slight a woman ae not worthy of their soriety and for their love they are requited with reproaches harsh language scorne and disdaine
but speake not this in generall for know there are many provident honest

and loving men that giveth all due respect to their wives and are carefull of their reputation and charge and heartily wish that the number of such men were greater for then so many good and honest women should not féele so much griefe sorrow and misery as both they and their families doe now sustaine

could have written more amply both divine and morall in defence of vertuous women but suppose these few examples will give some satisfaction to the courteous and affable reader hoping none will dislike or take exceptions thereat unlesse it be those carping criticks before spoken of which hath written so bitterly and scoffingly against the worthy sex of women but could wish them to petition for peace and to make their recantations and to confesse their follies for thus salute them blush foule envie and give o're split your pens and write no more silent be and hold your tongue sue for pardon that did wrong vertue goodnesse modesty which kinde hearts will not deny

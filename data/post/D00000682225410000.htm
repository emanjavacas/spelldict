a proclamation against the recusants to the common cause within the colledge of iustice as followeth wee blamelesse beautie badges bright of peace vvhite shining smyles of lady iustice face and glory of that pomp expecting traine vvhose aymes by us are honour now to gaine
for as much as that fleeing herald fame doth still by her voice proclame each where that for our crowne faiths defence our present progresse keepes a residence here in dunglasse where now our curious eyes vvith looks as waking lyes still in await as pleasing to bee deign'd here to attend those unto us assign'd by truths blew flags our sister in degree both sprung from noble iustice pedigree as als our patience did not yet disdaine to wait the lurking fragments of our traine that yet remaines as our assur'd supplie bought long agoe by love and clemencie albeit to them heavens helping hand hath beene most liberall as mortall eyes hath seene vvhose prodigall usher ladie providence
fraught their desires with a right large expence of golden strength by nursing vertues hand and made them strong in our just cause to stand under the shelter of our famous name vvhich by the right of thankfulnesse wee claime aye due by them and that for their supplie of true religion and our libertie that so our sight might terrifie our foe as did our noble name a yeare
but those hopes were blasted long ere time could bring these blossomes to an happie prime
vvhose fruits deceit's nay rather in respect they nothing bring but showes of mere neglect
vvhich all men knowes did spring from servile fear or that now the swey doth bear
yet whilst wee did sweet smylling peace enjoy then seem'd they readie subjects to imploy and trac'd the streets with such a gallent grace as if their worth consisted in their pace but when proud mars once shew his angrie brow their fainting hearts then seem'd for feare to bow
their courage which their tongues some times did keep now in their secret cels doth soundly sleep
vvith gaping gried they glorie in their gaine vvhich lurking they atchieved with honours staine they care not for their faith nor countries good so they buy ease with their own brethrens blood
thus then wee see their faith and courage cold now make their feeble breasts in nothing bold except it bee a venus to imbrace much more esteem'd than brave bellonas face then lo what cause wee have so to proclame them wanting braines to our name
herefore since threats nor our perswasions faire nothing avails vvee will and wee declare that this home delighting crew as well of vvhite as of the collours blew bee from and by all humane lawes esteem'd recusants to our noble cause
and als wee finde and thinke expedient that they and every one of them bee rent and cut cleane off with shames infamous strock as withred boughes from blooming iustice stock
and wee command that this our will bee shown and in each place that fame doe make it known
vvhich we here stamp with truth faire iustice seal that never died nor ever yet shall fail

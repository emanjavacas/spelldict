PRophesies, predictions, Stories and fictions, Allegories, rimes, And serious pastimes For all manner men, Without regarde when, Or where they abide, On this or that side, Or vnder the mid line Of the Holland sheetes fine, Or in the Tropicks faire Of sunshine and cleere aire, Or vnder the pole Of chimney and seacole: Reade they that list, vnderstand they that can, Verbum satis est to a wise man.
IT seemes that Tunis is an auncient towne Neere to the ruines of Carthage once so prowde, Whose stately buildings now are cleane pulled downe, And calmde her bruit, that sounded sometime lowde: But roome, that is their auncient far away Doth holde, and shall, though cities all decay.
Roome is more large, then spacious Millaine faire, Or Venice or the Tartars great Camball, Boeams three Prages, or Egypts rich Alcaire, Or Quinsei in Cataie, biggest of them all, And more say, after the day of doome Hell shall be no where, vnles it be in roome.
ROome is a taker, Poets say, And lawyers are so too, you see Roome is a taker by my faie, No learned man can disagree, And roome shall take, beleeue well me, At least till something, no where be.

SAy what it is and if you can, That neither was by God create, Nor framed by the hand of man, Nor by the fiend that doth him hate; But caused it was for tyrants strong, As things are many of great woorth, Which made it straight and woondrous long When at the first, they brought it foorth: And good it doth, and none ill deedes, Feeding vpon greene grasse and weedes.
Prince, for his delight, erected a spacious forrest, which beareth euen in the coldest monthes of the yeeres, store of sweet flowers, holsome herbs, and faire trees, some blossoming, some bearing fruit.

And when he comes once to the signe of the Dolphine, the Phenix beginneth to die, which first begun to liue, when he entred, at the signe of the Ramme.

BEleeue me now tell it for notale, There is a Queene, or else a Goddesse t'one, That without helpe of man, or any male Conceaueth daughters by her selfe alone: But at their birth, be it by night or day, Some skilfull man, the midwiues part doth play.
When they be borne, and perfectly brought foorth, Both olde and yong doe greatly them desire; Their beautie and their power is of such woorth, That all mens harts, therewith are set on fire: And in all times, they beare as great a sway As if on earth, there were no queenes but they.
Creature is that humane flesh deuoures, From out whose howels fatnesse may be taken, That being dried by fire, a certaine houres Will waxe as hard, as crust of bread well baken, Which fat dissolued, and with the leane confused Of that bodie, from whom you must it take, May be with skill and industrie so vsed, That a confection thereof we doe make Greatly helping, though it be held no woonder Against all tempest, lightning and thunder.
HAndsome she was, and well beseene, As fresh as any of them all, Her raiment for the most part greene, Her stature good and meetely tall.
Mounsier did take her by the arme And friendly entertained her, His countenance said he meant no harme, But well wot he strained her, That (as lamenting her mishap) She cried, perhaps she cracked too, Yet Mounsier would not leaue her lap For any thing that she could doo, This was a scholler by S. Anne, ciuill, sober, honest manne.

WHilst Phebus lodgeth in his southerne Inne, His auncient Inne, at signe of Capricorne, His northren lasse, her raiment waxeth thinne, And for her Lord she seemes to pine and morne, meane the lasse that many brings to scorne, And makes men oft reueale their proper shame, Her maker once, tooke to himselfe her name.

AS Pallas was ingendred from her fathers braine, So was one other guest, that see men doe entertaine, She sprang from neither grift, nor plant, nor egge nor seede, Ne is she fish, or flesh, or graine, or pulse or herbe or weede, With Ladies and great Lordes, she is both day and night, And clergie men, and prelats graue, sometime in her delight.
Some thinke that the deuill, begat her on his dame, Because that he much euill doth, and mischiefe by her frame: thinke not so, but wish, she soberly were vsed, That neither she nor men by her, might hencefoorth be abused.
Virgine faire, betwixt whose milke white Paps sometime lay, When was borne, the midwiues part And nurses too did play, To whom spent, my formost age Working both day and night, And recompensed her taken care With profit and delight, Vntill by fate, without my fault In prison was cast, And held in giues, which had made, From which breaking at last: Such change and chaunces hath the world, dotage made me blinde, In amorous sportes kild my selfe Foole: propagating kinde.

Right good ones he lets goe, For better still to stay, Till that the sunne is welnigh set, And gone almost the day: Then downe vnto the ground In stately sort he hies, Where he a hungrie supper makes On wormes and butterflies.
THe welkin is welnigh, out of our seeing, Our eies and thoughts are on the ground remaining, On th' earth or no, where is our happie being, Yet there we euer grudge, and are complayning, But turne vs so, that heauen hang in our spying, And straight we leaue, our murmur, and our crying.
ONe rips the earth, another cuts the seas, And runs the world in circuite round about, All for my sake, doe all men so please, That all doe seeke, which way to finde me out.
In Diadems in scepters, and in Crownes, In robes, in rotchets, in a Cardnals hat, In scarlet, silkes, in costly furred gownes, In stones and pearles, and in wot not what, In horses, haukes, bounds, harlots, and in bookes, One flieth for me, vp into the skies, Another downe to Plutoes raigne he tookes, Where all this glistering Or and argent lies.
This search declares, how greatly men doe leeke me, But they are mad so far from home to seeke me.

Some were fine lier trained vp, and for their delicacie, waxed in fauour with faire virgins great matrones, gentlewomen and great Ladies.
To all which they were so inwarde and neerely conioyned, that scarcely brother or husband was permitted to be with them of equall trust.
Many of these waxed so skilfull, and stored with all manner of learning, that more of them became diuines, lawiers and then are to be found in Paris, Padua, Bononia, Venice or Vienna.
Of this last sort, sundry which grew to be embassadours, secretaries, and intelligencers, were finally brought to violent death by fire, or interred in so fowle a fashion, that not knowing with what termes to expresse it, must of force leaue it, to be deuined at.
AFter midnight, ere it was day His eies he did vnclose, And striuing for to get away From prison he arose, With bodies two as colde as Leade He wrought so fine a feate, That other two which seemed dead Receiued life and heate.
Then dead men came about him round, wot not who they were, But of much thing deepe and profound With them he did confer.
WE are in number not fiue times fiue, No one of vs two handfull long, Nor any of vs takes care to thriue, Yet all together we doe so throng, That if a man would list to striue T'extinguish or to doe vs wrong, Were he the greatest prince aliue, We should be found for him too strong, And could make him infamous in time to come, Though most of vs beene deafe and dombe.

Am not, but am said to bee, And many things are told of mee, As first for sooth that am blinde, And bushed before, and balde behinde: And that halting come to one, And flie when as will be gone: With fooles my godhead is not small, With wise men it is none at all.
SVch as the companie is, such am I, And thinke some other folke are so too, To two Ladies great euer am nie, And we with the world haue much to doo: Tis hard for a lowte to tell ye my name, And shame for a clerke if he hit not the same.

My liuing lieth not in my lands, Yet am daintie, fine and sweete.
The Ladies take me in their hands, Their lips and mine full often meete.
Their paps, their cheekes well may touch, In smiling sort with me they play, Their husbands thereat thinke not much, No: though downe with them doe lay: In sooth it is a foolish sin, When foolish husbands iealous bin.
TWo forward went, and one did seeme to stay them: Foure after ran, and fiue did ouerlay them, Of which one dead, foure quicke was comprehending: And all these twelue vnto one marke were tending.

Sawe one stately stalking like a crane Strike at a stripling, something like a man, At the first stroke, he gaue the wretch his bane, Threw him in the dirt, and with him ran Vnto the water, where he washt and beate him, And at a mouthfull at the last he eate him.
Murtherer, a prisoner, barelyfed Was first of all depriued of the light, And then straightwaies vnto the gallowes led, Which did belong to him of very right: Where hanged he was something against my will, Though some good folke could wish him hanged still.
But one of power, the power of law to stay, That ere this time, did a companion make him: The prince himselfe came passing by that way, And from the gallowes graciously did take him: The best is though he did enjoy this fauour, He standeth bound vnto the good behauiour.

The scutiger had tarried but a little while, Ere Morpheus gan vpon his forehead for to creepe, His stomacke vapours sent, which did his braines beguile, And ere he was aware, he falleth fast asleepe: The Master hoping well, that well his man did watch, Accorded with the girle, her husbands coate to patch.
To kissing first they fell, and after that to play, Souldiers fight sometimes, ye wot it well in sport, And can tell no more, what they did doe or say, God knowes haue no skill of warring in this sort: But as the neighbours tolde, such warre the souldier maked, That at the locke they lay, and both of them were naked.
Tacitum petiuit, my captaine falles asleepe, One in at window lookes, where close he them espied, And tarrying not a whit, either to laugh or weepe, He backward with the newes, vnto the husband hied, Which calde his friends vnto him, these pigeons for to get, And soone he had them both, caught fast within his net.
The lookers on did laugh, the captaine was ashamed, The husband was as angrie, as any man could be, And though the wife by friends, and by her man were blamed, Yet made she her defence, and chid as fast as he: Thou hast (said she) ere this, thy slouens armefull borne, By stealth as we did now, of many a neighbours corne.
She praies to be diuorced, but he would not agree To heare that motion made, it made his hart full sore To set them in a sheete, alas why should it bee, They had been sheeted now three howers and somwhat more.
Forgiuenesse, that was best, the soulder him reuested, The goodman kissed his wife, all quarrels were digested.
His squire still at the doore, this while lay fast asleepe, His helmet clapped close vnto his drowsie head, He dreamed that he sawe, a louely lasse to weepe, Inchained with his Lord vpon a feather bed: And in this dreame he lay still in a mischiefes name, Vntill his captaine came, and found him in the same.
By shoulders he him tooke, he quickly made him wake, What was to him befalne, he did describe and tell, His angrie looke and noise, did make the wretch to shake, Villaine he cried, how saiest, hast thou not serude me well, Thou varlet base, thou asse, thou drunken headed ape, thee coniure straight way, leaue of thy souldiers shape.
His spurres to bodkins turned, his lips conuert to horne, His beard turned all to flesh, gone was his manly face, His shirt of maile and helmet, that he long had worne, To plumes and cockscombe turned, this was a foule disgrace: Behold and see, what tis, an angrie one to serue, That for a toy forgets, what seruing did deserue.
He liueth still, and still retaines a souldiers minde, With Switzers he will go, when they are waged to fight, Vnto a lasse he is, more then his captaine kinde, And fiue or sixe at once, doe lodge with him all night: Remembring still the fault, that did him ouerthrowe, He cries at peepe of sunne, Looke to your windowes hooe.

At last they enuironed a worshipfull knights house, and had assuredly won entrance into it, had not his seruants beene, who with such woonderfull resistance, stopped their passage; that no one of them, were he much lesse then a Pigmei, could make any irruption, yet left they way for a friend, which got in, of stature greater than euer was Atlas, or the goodly sonne of Grandgosier.
WIth cordes they haled her from the ground, And did about them lay, Like lustie ringers of the bels, Vpon some holiday.

But pride men say, will haue a fall, Euen so had I, and therewithall To seruants seruant became, And euery puzzell is my dame.
When that once haue done my worke, am inforced in hurnes to lurke, Expecting when for want of meate, My fellow seruant should me eate. Louers had, had words been true, As many as faire Corinna had, Yet when my foes me ouerthrew, My friends looked on, and were right glad.
When he that earst did me defend Vntill the day of dreadfull death Did hasten most vnto mine end, Striking the stroke which reft my breath, And from my graue men me remoue, Pretending still they doe me loue. Coniurer was circling in the aire, With nimble eies attentiue on the ground, Where walking spirits, nousled many a paire, Making a search the harmelesse to confound, They wrought to reaue poore wretches of their breath, Which neuer in life did ought deseruing death.
saide to an abettor looking on, Those innocents were woorthie of some pittie, He answere made, and sware by sweete S.

¶A deuoute Epystle or Treaty+se for them that ben tymorouse and fearefull in Conscience whyche Treatyse yf yt be well red ouer folowyd wyll brynge the Reders out of all Scrupulosyte of Conscience and seruyle feare brynge them to the holy feare and Loue of almyghty God.
Co~pyled by a brother of Syon (Called wyllyam Bonde a Bacheler of Diuynite) on whose soule Iesu haue mercy.
And by that same fre~de ouerseen deuyded in to .xx. Chapitres, to the more comforte of the Reders.
And yt may be cal+led the Co~solatori of Timorouse and fearefull Consciencys.
¶A Preamble or Introduccion in to this Treatyse of what thyng he entendyth to speake of.
Oure lorde ever preserue you in his marcy and encrease hys grace in your soule so to procede from verteu to verteu in this oure paynfull pylgrymage: that lyke as now ye be spowsyd to the son of god by grace: so fynally ye may attayne to be parfytly maryed to our sayd lorde in glory euerlastynge Amen. ¶youre charite mouyth me to wryte vnto you thoughe vnaquayntid bycause ye haue sent to vs many diuers tokens vndeseruyd on oure parte.
require you for the loue of our lorde that ye do no more so.
All our la+boure dylygence shulde be to haue tokens sente to vs from heuen.
what thyng or plesure in this world may co~tent saciate the soules of them yt haue despy+syd vtterly forsaken all this world with his po~pes and pleasures for the loue of Iesu cryst.
For these worldly pleasures may be rather a let gret hynderance to the holy loueyng soule yf yt kepe not the selfe loose fre from all suche vanyties Do delicate precious is the loue of god that those parsons whiche intende to haue yt must not only de+spise all worldly pleasures: but also theyr owne wyl appetytes.
And no maruel: for this loue of god ys more pleasure tresure to man then all the ryches of the worlde.
This notwithstandyg suppose that su+che temporall tokens haue ben suffred vsyd sent receyued of holy parsons· not for any pleasure that shulde be taken therof: but as sygnes and tokens of parfyt loue charite. wherin they be vnyed knyte in oure lorde god that sendyth or receyueth suche tokens.
Now good sister wot not what may write vnto you for gostly exhortacion spu~all co~forte. bycause that byfore this tyme haue nether writen vn+to you ne yet moche otherwayes haue ben acquaintid with you.
But your spu~al frende hathe so instant+ly mouyd me therevnto: that can not co~ueniently denye his godly deuoute request.
Besechyng oure moste mercyful lorde that yt may be to his honoure and youre spirituall comforte.
ANd for as moche as the holy prophet Dauid sayeth.
The holy feare of god is the begynynge of all gostly wysdom and spu~all buyldyng.
And the apostell Paule sayeth Charitas est vinculum {per}feccionis et finis precepti.
Charite or the holy loue of god is the ende knotte of all parfeccion.
Therfore to co~byne the begynyng of goostly wysdom to the ende of parfeccion.
purpose su~what to declare of these tow accordyng to the sentence of holy scripture and after ye mynde of holy doctours sayntes declarynge the same for ye spu~all co~solacion gostly co~forte of suche deuoute sowles. as be su~what tymerous ferefull in conscience.
THys holy feare of god ys a spu~all reuerence whiche the sowle of man hathe to hys maker as the naturall chylde to his father.
The chylde wyl not displese hys father be cause he so louyth hym na+turally that he had leuer suffre gree payn or than he wolde be out of the fauoure of hys father or to be seperate from his presence.
Thys ys a kynde naturall reuerence and a chyldly feare.
And suche is the feare that we oughte to haue to God.
Oure feare to god oughte to be a kynde loueynge reuerence so that we had leuer suffre all paynes then to be seperate from his grace.
Thys as saynt Thomas sayeth is the mo+ste parfyt feare that man may haue in thys worlde.
Thys feare although euery crystyan man woman shulde haue: yet more specially those yt ben the spouses of cryste oughte to haue the holy reuerence and reuerente feare of god.
It kepyth preseruyth man euer in the loue of God.
It euer comyth wyth charite that is the holy loue of god and departyth with the same It euer lenyth and cestyth vpon charyte and encrea+syth with yt.
And neuer may be seperate from grace None may haue thys. but those that ben in the grace and fauoure of god.
And none may haue this excellently but the spouses of cryste Iesu suche that hathe forsaken the worlde for his loue. ¶what is the seruyle feare what yuells comyth to vs there by.
ANother feare there ys that ys assy+mylyd comparyd to a bondman or a hyryd saruante whiche dothe feare and drede hys master for hys cruelte and Iustice euer kepynge and fulfyllynge hys co~mandemen+tes for drede of punysshemente or leste he wyll take hys wages from hym.
Thys feare contentyth not god but rather yf yt be vndyscretly vsyd moche dyspleasyth hys grace and specially in those of whome god lokyth to haue an hyer reueren+ce that ys the holy loueyng feare that spake of be+fore.
They oughte to rendre to god an holy loueyng reue+rence and not to feare god in hys Iustice only wyth a mystruste of hys mercy supposynge for euery tryfull dampnacion in theyre erroniouse conscience.
Thys ys the seruyle feare thys contentyth not god. but yf yt be vsyd vndiscretly it sore displeasyth hym for yt takyth his honoure hys dew reuerence from hym as moche as man may.
Thys feare the greate synners of the worlde hathe some tyme.
They feare dampnacyon theyre conscience puttyth them in remembrance of theyr syn although for lacke of grace they haue no remorse of the same.
But in religiouse parsons co~menly yt ys more trouble then other syn or daunger for yt drawyth them to a scrupulosyte feare of spyryt that yt makyth them thynke that all that they do is noughte. and yet they be in grace and lyue full holely but not so holely as they shulde do. yf they labouryd to put that seruyle feare away.
for yf they wolde they shulde profyt moche go foorth in holy lyfe where as now in thys feare they other stande styll or go backwarde.
For thys seruyle feare so pressyth downe the holy loue of god: that yt may not haue lyberty to spryng as yt wolde.
For the holy reuerence lyftyth the eye of mannes soule euer vpwarde to god where contrary wyse the seruyle feare fireth the eye of man euer in hell for there ys nothynge in pages missing] of hell more then they doo.
But to the saruantes of cryste the relygiouse parsons whyche wyth all theyr myndes and study applyeth them selfe to sarue god dayly and neuer to offende his grace yt is necessary to vse thys forsayd meditacion of feare wyth dyscre+sion in tyme place and cyrcumstance conueniente.
As when they ben dulle sluggysshe and not promp+te or redy to goostly warkes.
Or when they haue car+nall thoughtes or vayne gloryous thoughtes or su+che other that lettyth them from the saruice of god.
Then a meditacio~ of the paynes of hell or of godes Iustice is necessary as a pricke to pricke them forth and to quycken theyr dulle soule to do theyre dewty.
Otherrwyse yt may do hurte and abate theyr loue whyche shulde not be for in loue restyth all parfeccion.
Thys wryte by cause many be deceyued in fe+tynge and dredynge god and specyally som relygiouse parsons takeynge the one feare for the other wenynge that they rendre to god the dew feare and holy reuerence and yt is not so.
For they only dreade hym for hys Iustice and so gyue hym but a seruyle feare whiche contentyth hym not.
¶How of seruyle feare comyth scrupulo+syte that moche trobelyth the relygiouse parson.
FArthermore this seruyle fere vndiscretly vsid bryngyth them to suche a scrupulosyte of conscience by the reason wherof. they ben broughte to suche a maruelous trouble of spirit that nether they can profyte in grace and in the seruyce of god: nor yee can not doo theyre dewly as they shulde doo to theyr lorde in tyme and place conuenient.
And all ys because that they know not the nature of that spirituall dysease callyd scrupulosyte.
And to what gebardyse parelles confusyons yt may bryng them yf yt be not remouyd and put vtterly a way whiche ys very easy to all them that be wylynge to lyue in pece of spryte holy loue of god.
For how many they kepe theyr lorde in theyr harte contynually whose co~science is ful of trouble by scrupulosite syth scrip+ture sayeth that his mansyon dwellynge place ys euer where peace is.
Then the mansyon of god may not be fyxed in a scrupulouse soule whyche is euer trobelyd ful of wauerynges and doutfulnes.
And though the tabernacle of grace for a time may be in theyr soule yet there yt may not contynually abyde. by the reason of the grete troble that ys in theyr con+science.
How may grace abyde in that co~science that makyth dedly syn of euery veniall syn.
they make a greuous mortall syn of that that is no syn at all but rather verteu.
when suche a parson hathe vsyd longe tyme pryuate prayers and deuocio~s.
At the comau~dement of his prelate when he shulde do the worke of obedience: then his scrupulouse conscience wyll bynde hym to the contrary.
say yt is dedly syn to leue his deuocions vnsayde And also morouer whe~ he hathe vsyd certayne pray+ers of deuocion to the whyche he ys not bounde of duty. somtyme is scrupulouse conscience wyl pricke him so with feare that he dare not omyt leue suche volu~tary prayers for ony cause resonable.
that byndeth them to theyr erronyouse co~science. whiche they oughte to refuse remoue for+sake depose at the cou~seyll of theyr prelates or spi+rituall fathers.
For though ye conscience dothe euer bynde. yet when yt is erroneouse yt shulde be deposyd and dothe not bynde p~cysely for yt may shulde be put a way.
To whome may a scrupulouse relygi+ouse parson be comparyd? Certeynly to a man that walkyth in a way that is most playne· plesante and sure and yet he wyll stu~ble at a pease or at a whete corne or at a cherystone for a scrupul ys callyd suche a lytel stone.
Euyn so of suche maner his he wor+thy grate derysyon that wyll be scrupulouse in rely+gion. whiche is the most right playne sure and ple+sau~t way that eny criste~ man may walke in to god.
And yet in relygion the scrupulouse parson wyll stu~+ble at euery strawe and somtyme make that thyng that is verteu by his weake coniectures corrupte estymacions to be vyce that syn that is but venyall to be greuous mortal.
And the cause of all this is for he knoweth not the nature of scrupulosite.
He knoweth not what yt is whereof yt rysyth or bredyth what thynges they be that noryssheth it what thynges maynteyneth yt to what gebardy it bryng+eth the parson that is infecte wyth yt and how by what maner they myghte haue remedy to remoue it and vtterly put yt a way.
By cause that all these pre+mysses somtyme be vnknowen the parsons that be scrupulouse be maruelously troubelyd broughte to so greate feare of conscience and spirite: ye scantly they can goo forthe in the saruyce of god as they shulde do.
And yet the thynge that troubelyth them ys but a tryfle in yt selfe and sone remouyd yf they wolde put ther good wyll there vnto. vndoutyd to the greate encrease of verteu in theyr soules.
shall teche somwhat for the conforte of ye said parsons and fyrste what is scrupulosyte.
¶Scrupulosyte is callyd somtyme pusyllanimite somtyme the feare of co~science somtyme erronious of conscience and thus yt is dyffyned.
Scrupulosy+te is a dulle tediousnes and vndyscrete deieccion or trouble of the mynde by thoccasion of ymaginacions of certayne thynges whiche semyth to be co~tra+ry.
Also yt is callyd the fleyng or abhorrynge of fea+re by the whyche in a mynde vnstable imagenynge thynges for to come that byn terryble is causyd an anguysshe of spryte straytenes in conscience.
But that noble Clarke Gerson declaryth it more playne and sayeth.
Scrupulosyte ys a waueryngnes or a doutefulnes and a feare that ys causyd of weake and vncerteyne coniectures of the mynde.
doutfull vndyscussyd and vncerteyne weake coniecture of reason trou+belous feare of the conscie~ce.
In the whiche wordes yt apperyth well that scrupulosyte is not the parfit dyscussyd acte of reason but rather a weake coniecture without deu delyberacion.
Let a scrupulouse parson be askyd cou~+seyl of an other in those thynges in the whiche he is tanglyd hym selfe and some tyme he wyll gyue holsom cou~seyll wythout scrupull and that he can not gyue to hymselfe wherfore it is playne that scrupu+lousnes dothe not {pro}cede of parfit delyberacion.
For yt is but a weake imaginacion or a feble coniecture of reason.
It apperith also that scrupulosyte is not the fynall sentence of conscience.
For yf yt were yt must nedes bynde to fulfyll the sayd sentence whether yt were good or yuel.
For after doctours the er+ronious co~science so dothe bynde as longe as yt is not put a way but it oughte euer to be deposyd and put a way when a thynge is fynally decreed of con+science conscience hathe no doute but strongly comau~dyth yt as yt apperyth in these worldly consciences in byyng selyng where ofte~ tymes though they do wronge they put no doutes.
But scrupulosi+te is euer a douteful feare of the co~science wherfore may co~clude yt a man may do ageynst his scrupu+louse mynde yet do not ageynst his co~science.
Also a man may put a way his scrupulosyte without comytyng of syn. but rather somtyme with meryte. to thencrease of grace verteu.
To do ageynst the conscience is syn. but to do agenst the feare or waueryng doutfulnes of the conscience may be without syn what so euer acte be wythout doute and feare: that ys no scrupul ne may be callyd a scrupulosyte.
That acte that procedeth not of parfyt dely+beracion but is in feare doute yt semyth a scrupu+lousnes.
Thus we haue shewyd you the nature of scrupulosyte. ¶wherof scrupulosyte rysyth or bredyth.
NOw we shall shew you whereof scrupulosite doth brede other p~mysses aforesayd.
Thou+gh doctours shew many dyuerse causes that may be occasio~ of scrupulosyte yet for this our purpose.
note one special cause aft doctours so~tyme therof yt is to say the naturall co~plexion of man when our fore father Adam had broken the comau~dement of god wher afore his syn he had his body at his wyll After his syn his flesshe was all rebellyng to hym full of diuers inclynacions to vice.
Inclinacions to Pryde to enuy to ire to couytousnes to slouthe to glotony to lechery.
with many other inclynacio~s lefte in man after ye dyuersyte of hys co~plexion as paynes dew for hys syn. som mo som lesse after the dyuersyte of theyr natural co~plexion.
note specially for this our purpose ye naturall incly+nacion to inordynat feare.
The whiche wolde cho+se if yt were in my lyberty afore all ye other perilous i~clynacio~s aforsayde.
For como~ly they yt of naturall disposycio~ byn disposyd to feares: they other wante many of ye other or else they be not moche troublyd with them as other be.
This natural inclynacion to feare after doctours may ryse of an humour in ye sto+make callyd melancoly whiche humour moche disposyth to fere specially in women.
whiche as saint Thomas sayeth. by the occasion of that humoure.
when they go alone they be vndiscretly fearyd. dre+dyth thynges that no constant crysten {per}sons shuld feare.
In the nyghte specially they woll ymmagyn that they se sprytes beastes and other deformyd fygures.
And all is that theyr fantasy by reason of the said humour whiche inclyneth them to the sayd feare.
Thys drede shulde not be in the spouses of criste.
In whose harte euer shulde be the quycke remembrau~ce of the passion of our lorde Iesu whiche makyth all feares to vanys+she a way.
as the flame of the fyre puttyth a way the smoke.
of the contrary and the son the shadow or darknes of the clowdes.
No cristen man or woman oughte to feare any damnyd sprytes.
For the lyons of hell be bounde and may do nothyng to man but only at the wyll of oure lorde.
And our moste gracyous master cryst Iesus neuer dothe suffre the enmy to appere vysybly to any of hys saruantes that loueyth hym. but he gyueth them gostly strengthe to resyst hym and not to feare hym as shall shew af+ter by example.
And also yt was playne manyfestly shewyd in saynt Margaret saynt Iulyan ye vyrgyn saynt Kateryne of sene and many other mo bo+the men and women.
And although scrupulosyte feare of conscience may be causyd many wayes. yet in women and som other that to our lorde be righte faythfull yt may ryse of this forsayd humoure inclynacion of natural co~plexion.
And therfore as we sayd before in suche yt is more trouble then dau~ger or peryll and those in co~science trymble and quake.
as the profet sayeth where no feare is. nor peryl and many tymes also no syn.
ANd not only the feare of the co~science or scru+pulosyte ys bred by the occasion somtyme of this inclynacion of nature but also yt is norysshed by an vnstable fantasy whyche comonly often tymes by thoccasion of this humor melancoly is dysposyd to ymagyn tho thynges that ben teryble and that is one cause that makyth the con+science troublyd and doutful full of feare. whiche feare is callyd scrupulosyte.
where the ymaginacion is moche occupyed wyth terryble fantasyes the mynde is moche inclyned to consyder the same And for as moche as to the faythfull sowle syn and sepe+racyon from god ys moste abhorryd therfore those thynges whiche shulde cause or folow of ye same be moste terible to the mynde as the iustice of god.
his moste strayte examynacion of all synnes. ye teryble pay+nes of hell and dampnacio~, that be ordenyd for synners. the acou~tes that man must then gyue of eue+ry ydell worde and of venyall synnes be they neuer so smalle. and the horryble co~pany of diuels suche other.
These vndyscretly co~syderyd causyth the ser+uyle feare of god. and that noryssheth the feare of co~+science scrupulosyte.
as the moysture of the erthe noryssheth the plante or herbe. and euyn so makyth yt growe and encrease.
And somtyme the enemy ryghte well knowyng the naturall dysposycion com+plexion of man helpyth forwardes and mouyth by suggestion ofte to the co~sideracion of the same and all these doth norysshe scrupulosyte. ¶wherof scrupulosyte is maynteyned.
The .ix. Chapitre ¶Scrupulosite is maynteyned as note specially of tow thynges. that is to say of an erroneous co~science and of the moste perylous spyce of pryde cal+lyd syngularite whiche is when a parson so testyth to his owne opinion and to his owne reson that he wyll not beleue eny other.
and thys ys the more peryllous yuyll of these tow.
For though a parson haue an erroneouse co~science yet yf he be meke wyll folowe counseyl.
he may sone put hys erroure a way. sone be curyd of this forsayd sprituall sycknes callyd scrupulosyte.
But yf he be infecte with syngularite yt is harde to remoue the erroure of his co~science excepte a spe+ciall grace and good wyll with dylygent labour of his owne parte.
Singularite is peryllouse in euery {per}son but as saint Gregory sayeth moste peryllouse in a relygyous parsone that entendyth parfeccyon Suche yf they take an opinyon or errour. harde yt is to remoue them from yt.
And specially as he sayeth in the begynyng of theyr co~uersion to relygyon Suche parsons scrupulouse and synguler in theyre owne wayes byn apte to be ouerthrowen in all te~ptacions and be dysposyd to receyue all the suggesti+ons of the enemy that is be cause they ben lyke to hym in theyr i~ordinat loue of theyr owne excellensy whiche is their syngularite.
Suche wyll kepe ye sma+le thynges of relygion precysely. suche {per}feccions as byn but tryfles.
but the greate parfeccions bor+dyns of relygio~ and specially obedience mekenes they wyl not kepe.
For pretendeyng parfeccion they ben euer redy to be ful of suspicions redy to take occasyons redy to set at noughte dyspyse and dysdayne the workes of other {per}sons.
But suche maner of {per}sons ben sore deceyued For they shall neuer {pro}fyt in gostlynes nor encrease in grace for god resystyth the syngular prowde parson as scrypture sayeth gyueth hys grace habu~dantly to the meke sowle.
Suche {per}sons ben euer vnquiet vnstable and full of troubles anguysshe of spirite partly by the reason of theyr scrupulosyte partly by theyr syngularite.
Theyr scrupulous con+science wyll trouble them amonge in theyr saruyce.
when theye haue sayde yt ones sufficiently as theyre fraylte wyl suffer yet they can not be co~tent but the feare of theyr conscience pricketh them so they say yt agayne twyse or thryse.
And worse at the seconde tyme then at the fyrste.
Let suche parsons know for a certenty that the churche byndeth no {per}son to say his saruice with actuall deuocion and actuall attencion of mynde in al his saruice.
For then he shulde offende in sayng of it when he hathe not actuall deuocion that is false.
For deuocio~ is of god not in our power to haue yt but as it pleasyth his grace.
Also as saynt Thomas sayeth yt is sufficient that in ye begynynge when he shulde say his saruice that he haue an entent to sarue god and to do his dewty.
Theyr syngularite also with feareful co~science comonly dothe vnquiet and trouble them in theyr confessions sore.
For they wyll forme make a greate co~science of those thyng+es that ben but tryfels in comparison lyghte offe~+ces and suche veniall synnes wythout the whiche yt is not possyble this lyfe to be co~tynuyd.
In suche they wyll make suche precyse serche and dyscusse of conscience that they wyll leue nothyng vnconfessid but make conscience of all theyr lyfe and vnwysely more wepyng theyr offences in the balance of the iu+stice of god then in the balance of his marcy.
Such yf they folow not cou~seyle put a way this scrupul they shall come to this inco~uenience that they shall make conscience of that that is no syn and confesse that that is no vyce nor matter of confession and that is not to be done.
This smellyth all of syngula+rite and specially in them that comyth to confession haueyng co~petent contricion as this clarke Gerson sayeth and somtyme habou~dant co~tricion and maketh theyr confession sufficyently: yet by ye reason of theyr scrupulousnes syngularite they be not content nor can be suffysyd with one confession sufficiently made but somtyme they wyl make tow or mo co~fessions of suche smalle synnes and so do they vn+reuerence dyshonoure to the holy sacrament of pe+nau~ce and mystrust the same bothe wery themself and also theyr gostly father.
They quake tremble as the prophet sayeth where no drede is.
Suche say+eth this forsaid clarke byn syngular more trustyng in theyr owne iustice then in ye marcy of god.
They wene to make them selfe so clene that they shall haue no nede of ye marcy of god but they loke to be sauyd by his iustice But let suche take hede what our sauiour sayeth in his holy rewle whiche we haue {pro}fessyd blyssyd be hys holy name euer more therfore. that yf a man wolde suffer hym selfe to be slayne in his body yf yt were possyble a .C. tymes for penau~ce yet for all that he shuld not be worthy to come to he+uen yf god wolde procede after the only rygoure of his iustice ageynst hym.
Thus we haue shewyd you wherof as in parte and as of one rote scrupulosyte dothe brede wherof yt is norysshed and mayntenyd that is to say of co~plexion yt may spryng of an vnstable fantasy and seruyle feare yt may be noryshed and of an erroneous co~science syngular mynde yt may be maynteyned.
NOw restyth behynde to shew what pareyls trou+bles ieobardy scrupulosyte may brynge eny parson to.
Fyrst as co~+cernyng the pareyles and ieobardies to the whiche scrupulosite may brynge that parson that restyth in yt there be many dyuers. of yt whiche all for lacke of tyme can not write now. yet one ieobardy no+te that fynde in a notable doctour to the whiche those that ben infecte with scrupulosite somtyme be broughte.
And lyke as haue shewed one occasion wherof yt may sprynge and breyde.
That ys naturall co~plexion: so lyke wyse shall shew one pareyl and ieobardy aboue all other to the whiche yt may brynge.
Doctours and specially physyciens determyne and say that of a certeyne humoure in the sto+macke whether that humoure be melancoly as yt is lyke to be or els a dust coloure or rather a blacke fleme.
leaue yt to them that be lernyd in physycke but they say that of suche an humoure there rysyth a blacke a darke fume to the hed whyche so troubelyth the sensis and hed of man that by thoccasion therof reaso~ is darkenyd. that as saynt Thomas sayeth is the gretest payne that may be in this worl+de and specially to the faythful soule.
For yf reason be darkenyd and may not haue his course to discerne discusse parfytly thynges as hym oughte to do that causyth in the conscience of man or woman feare waueryng doutfulnes and that is scrupulo+syte.
And so longe without remedy that feare maye growe that it wyll brynge ye conscience halfe to con+sent to thynges that ben wrong whiche for lacke of dew delyberacion reason can not discusse nor discer+ne.
And paraduenture fall to mocions of infidelyte. to anguysshe of spyrit tediousnes of lyfe. thynkeyng all that they do to be noughte.
And that they be forsaken of almyghty god. and delyuerid to the han+des of the enemy for theyr synnes and so fall to des+peracion.
This is the greatest payne that may be in this worlde to the faythfull soule.
And in paciently sufferynge this payne and in wysely ouercomynge the same there is {pro}mysed the greate crowne of glory so moche more glory that the payne ys importable.
And certeynly this payne or some other lyke. ys necessary moche holsom for the syngular {per}sone to kepe hym in mekenes leaste he shulde fall to farther pryde and so lose the fauour of god crowne of glory.
There is as saint Augustine sayeth for euery syn a dew payne.
And god of iustice hathe comaundyd that euery inordynate mynde shall receyue hys dew payne in hym selfe.
The Gloton hys payne so forthe of other But among the~ all there is no payne so meyte to suppresse syngularyte as these forsayd spirituall paynes temptacions.
The whiche for as moche as we haue shewyd how they may com ryse in some maner wyse of the route of our corupte nature wherfor suche may be somtyme more payne then parell. as we haue sayd before.
For doctour Gerson sayeth that there is a good scrupulosyte and a good desperacion.
That is a good desperacion that reryth vp the dull soule of man ma+kyth yt stronge in hope.
for the faythful soule beyng in fore temptacions paynes seyng that he can not delyuer helpe hym selfe he castyth all his thoughtes harte mynde body soule in to the handes of god hys maker cleuyth fast to his marcy. as doth the nedyll to ye adamant stone.
And that soule doutles shall haue co~forte of god. whiche anone as he receyueth he ys euer afterwarde more strong in hope than he was before.
that ys occasio~ to remoue the soule from seruyle feare tyme+rous co~science to harty faruent loue.
And that ys a good mocion of infydelyte by the occasyon of the whiche man may obteyne clere faythe quicke fay+the in thynges co~cernyng his saluacio~.
write not this ye only euery man yt ys scrupulous syngular hathe these forsaid spu~al infyrmytyes temptacio~s but also som tymes the stronge faythfull saruantes of god. that had leuer haue theyr hartes pluced out of theyr brestes then in worde dede or thought they wolde declyne from ye trew faythe. and loue of Iesu criste.
And for as moche as allmyghty god loueyth them moste syngularly. therfore he wyll proue them in the fornace of payne tribulacion. lyke as he dyd his naturall eternall son our sauioure lorde Iesu crist.
And the cause ys. that aboue other paciently sufferyng the same they be preordinate to haue an hyer crowne of glory in heuen.
For as that noble deuoute clarke. whome suppose ye bothe knew and louyd for his synguler verteu Doctoure Chubbes in hys conflate co~paryth the swetnes of deuocion faruoure of charyte vnto mylke. wyth whiche. god often tymes dothe fede and norisshe his tendre chyldren suche as ben tendre in fayth wea+ke in faythe weake in hope feble in loue.
But the stronge saruantes cha~pions of god. byn fed wyth a more stronge meate as with paynes labours co~mau~dementes {pro}feccions greate troubles tempta+cions aduersityes. whiche yf they suffer pacyently and so {pro}uyd kepe hole breke not from the loue of god. suche be blyssed sayeth the wyse man.
And they shall haue the crowne of glory whiche god hathe {pro}+mysyd kepyth for them.
And saynt Iames in hys epystle exhortyth euery faythfull soule to the same. sayng.
Be glad and esteme yt for a great ioye when ye be in troubles temptacions.
For syth the lyfe of faithfull man is co~paryd to batayle in scripture.
the cristian man shulde not care nor abate his gostly co+rage to god when he is assayled by the enemy.
or otherwyse tossyd in aduersyte. knowyng for certayne that none may come to heuen but by troble payne Saynt Paule sayth.
Them whom god receyueth admyttyth as hys chyldren he correctyth in thys worlde.
And none may loke to be enheritours of the kyngdome of heuen ye in this worlde wyll suffre no payne.
And therfore ye faithful saruant of god shuld not regarde moche what payne he dothe suffre. nor of whome hys payne takyth occasion or ys causyd.
For know ye for certayne yt all payne sensyble is wr+oughte of god. of hym pryncipally ys comau~dyd.
And thoughe the occasio~ of oure syn som tyme may be ye cause by the suggestio~ of ye enemy.
And though also ye cause meritorious may be our selfe.
other by our surfet or necglygens fraylte ignorance or corrupte wyll yet the payne is only of god as ye prynci+pall cause to rectify other the syn yt is past or to lett the syn yt is to com. so ye {pro}phete Dauid sayeth. that god correctyth man for syn.
Then we shulde not mo+che care nor be wery of payne but we ought dylyge~t+ly to apply all our study after the cou~sayl of ye wyse man.
How we may receyue wyth harty thankes all suche thynges yt god shal sende. whether they be aduersities or {pro}speritie.
And often to reuolue recou~t in our mynde: how we may p~pare order our selfe pacie~tly to suffre endure to co~tynew hole vnbro+ken. in such te~ptacions aduersities {pro}ues.
For lyke as ye fier tryeth {pro}uyth ye syluer or golde. so ye forna+ce of payne tribulacio~ {pro}uith ye elect chyldren cho+sen e~heritours of ye kyngdom of heuen. saint Paule wytnessyth yt same. sayng.
hope neuer confou~dyth but gyuyth such gostly stre~gthe to man knytteth his har+te so fast to god. yt all payne is plesure to hym aug+mentacio~ of strengthe grace.
The pottar when he turnyth his vessel in ye first tyme makyth yt as long as it is grene erth. he setyth no gret store by it.
But when he hathe put it in ye fier. after take it out agen if he fynd it broken.
he wyl sone cast it a syde as noughte settyth no store therby.
But yf yt be hole and sou~de when he takyth it out of the tyer. then he makyth moche of yt. trustyng that yt shall re~dre yelde hym suche avantage as he made yt for And that pot so beynge hole sounde after the fyer. yf yt had reason vndersto~dyng myght haue grete co~fort trust to com to that ende that yt was made for.
That parson that in paynes temptacions can suffer all paciently endure hole breke not he may haue greate hope trust of hys saluacyon.
Thus we haue shewed you to what ieobardy scrupulousnes and syngularite bryngeth.
The .xi. Chapitre ¶NOw we shall shew you what remedyes for the same.
As the famous clarke doctour Nydar sayeth and also yt ys in speculo spu~aliu~.
Scrupulosite is remouyd by .iii. thinges that is to say by deposyng putyng a way of the erroneous conscience.
In the whiche note that scrupu+losite shulde be remouyd dystroyed in a contrary wyse to the order wherof it dothe growe specially in this one poynte of scrupulosyte that we haue taken to entrete of.
It is norysshed by an vnstable fan+tasy by seruyle feare and by the suggestion of the enemy.
Now fyrst after this forsayd clar+kes we oughte to do a way our erroneous co~science and then put a waye syngularyte take mekenes.
And as for the vnstable thoughtes cast them in the lappe of your gostly father.
then ye wolde drede the i~clynacion to vnclennes of the body or the in+clynacion to i~pacience or glotony. or eny other vyce ageyn the wiche we must euer fyghte there vpon dependyth and folowyth ye crowne of glory.
For as saynt Paule sayeth none shall be crownyd but only they that manly dothe fyghte for yt. in the batayl of verteu.
And yf scrupulousnes of these greate feares of conscience had byn good necessary: the holy sar+uantes of god that hath gon before vs wolde haue byn scrupulous that we rede not.
we shulde not haue had the i~numerable multytude of martyrs confessours and other holy fathers that byn past nor the vnspe+kable workes that holy doctours haue writen left for our co~fort. wyth many dyuers cou~seyls preceptes to directe our conscience agenst suche scrupu+losytyes.
And that they wolde not haue done yf we oughte to gyue place to suche feres.
Therfore be ne+uer wery of eny suche i~ordinat fearys. but take dew parte agenst them when they come.
And yf they wyll be fearse suppresse p~uent them by holy swete meditacions of ye goodnes of god. of his greate marcy benefytes loue that he hathe to man.
And thanke his grace for that yt hathe pleasyd hym to admyt man to be partenar of his glory.
The ordyr maner to put a way an erroneous conscience.
Doctours shewyth sayng that yt is moste sure to do yt after the counseyl of theyr gostly fathers and discrete confessours. for that putyth all thynges out of doute. bothe by the reason of theyre meke obedience to theyr co~fessour by the grace of the sacrament of penau~ce.
In the whiche vndouted the holy goste dothe often tymes illumyn lyghten i~spyre ye mynystre of ye said sacrament. yt is the pryst with the lyght of his grace cou~seyl For experience shewyth. how many that hathe byn scrupulous and in {pro}cesse of tyme parceyueyng theyr owne greate fo+lysshenes erroure laboryng in them selfe only after theyr syngular mynde to put yt a way not aft cou~seyll hathe fallen to further inco~uenientes on ye other party.
that is to saye they haue excedyd more in largenes of conscience.
And more haue drawen themselfe to the gebardy of p~su~pcion then euer they were in any dau~ger of desptracio~.
Bothe these saint Thomas forbyddeth. bothe to large co~science to streyghte conscience.
For the one bryngeth to p~su~pcion the other to desperacion.
But all our laboure shulde be to haue the quiet meane conscience.
For therin restyth the holy goste there in standyth par+feccion.
And therof encresith grace and verteu in re+lygion which syngularite principally doth let. therfore do yt a way as the mayntener of ye scrupul. and take in his place mekenes.
And mekenes dothe prefar the iugdemente of other byfore her owne.
And therfore is mekenes the moste souerente medcin agenst scrupulosite.
And that thyng ye prin+cipally puttyth it a way is to folow cou~seyl.
So we rede that saynt Barnarde remoued a greate feare scrupul from one of his bretherne whiche was so fe+ryd. that he durst say no masse.
He thoughte he had no fayth in the sacrament whose erroure saint barnarde wayng wysely dyscretly sayd.
And he so doyng for obedience had neuer more trouble of that scrupulousnes and feare.
But som wyll say. ye syr. saynt barnard was an holy man.
To this answerith doctor Gerson. sayeth. yt it was neyther the holynes of saint barnard nor his great lernyng that delyueryd this man.
that obayed and fo+lowed ye comau~dment cou~seyl of his father.
Therfore yt ys best to folow cou~seyl to ensew mekenes. and to put a way all syngularite.
For as we sayd in begynyng. lyke as the holy feare of god is the lock of all {per}feccion. so mekenes is the key of all {per}feccion. whiche openyth the hart of man to all thynges that byn goostly shyttyth yt fast from all thynges con+trary.
Then in all scrupuls yt is best and most redy medicyn to folow the cou~seyl of a discrete gostly father.
And as for saruice of the churche as matyns. euynsonge and suche other howres.
Let none be to moche scrupulous therin. we be as saynte Austyne sayeth no au~gels.
And what so euer we shall do som defaute we make therin. we can not do euery thyng so p~cysely as aungell can do.
as we allegyd saint Thomas byfore. let vs in the begynynge forme our mynde to god.
what so euer neglygence folowe. yf yt be not wylfully nor of conte~pte.
our mynde be abstracte. standyng the fyrst order of our mynde it is sufficient we be not bounde to say it agayne.
But yf eny lyghte neglygence fortune of oure fraylte be sory therfore with a consion on oure brest or som other token of contricion and go forthe And as for confession be not to far precyse therin.
For though in oure propre iugement it be not lawfull to thynke eny synne smalle. for that were blasphemy sayeth saynte Barnarde yet many synnes byne venyall and so smalle that as saynte Thomas sayeth we be not bounde to confesse them of very necessite by any comau~dement but only of con+gruyte.
Laudable yt is specially for the holy relygious parsons and moche behoueful holsom it is for theyr sonlles helthe ofte to co~fesse theyr dayly off+ences whiche comonly in maner byn but venyall.
But euer among co~cernyng the matter of co~fessyon be ware of the enemy specially that parson that is scrupulous.
For lyke as you put muddy water in a vessell touche the vessell the mud wyll ryse darke the water.
Euen so somtyme wyl the enemy (if he be sufferyd) touche our body moue the humours trouble the senses therof. so darke reason that yt shall nether se yt selfe. nor parfytly consyder the con+fession or other warkes that we haue made or done.
Then he wyll come say syr suche a syn ys not remytted of god. for yt was not trewly confessyd so make hym go to co~fession ageyn and specyally the scrupulous {per}son.
whose co~science is moche prompte and redy to co~sent by the reason of fere that is in yt But knowe ye well that this suggestion of the enemy is not done. to haue hym confesse hys syne. or to make hym haue remyssio~ of the same.
But as saynt Gregory sayeth the enemy somtyme wyll moue to verteu. by cause he wyll induce vice.
He wyll moue the prelate to Iustice. bycause he wolde make hym cruell. somtyme to pyte marcy because he wolde make hym neglygent.
And somtyme he wyll moue the relygyous parson to scilence prayer contemplacio~ because he wold make hym vayne gloryous somtyme moue hym to greate abstinence watche bycause he wolde brynge hym to ydelnes of brayne or other confusion.
And so lyke wyse. in this poynte he wyll moue to confession not for to haue them cle+ne in soule. but because he wolde trouble them in co~+science. for he hatyth peace he is callyd the pestylent spirit of discorde trouble.
Therfore though in grete crymes. abhomynable offences of the which man oughte euer to be a shamyd.
Syth shame the payne therof in penau~ce ys cou~tyd for a grete parte of co~tricion suche of mere deuocion a man often to co~fesse for the encrease of grace and meryt thoughe doctours comende yt. yet in this case other for the suggestion of the enemy or for eny scrupulousnes. doctours wyll that they shal not co~fesse them ageyn in cotidian dayly synnes and venialles of whiche they haue byn confessyd before.
but wysely to dyssymul it to resyst the enemy in yt poynte. yet this not withstandyng yf at eny tyme of only mere deuocio~ they be mouyd to make theyr lyfe soule clene then they may as the tyme ys expedient necessyte requi+reth.
These poyntes we haue rehersyd by cause scru+pulosyte is moche accustomyd to folow the same.
NOw lett vs se remedyes for the gebardyes temptacions rehersyd. whiche done folow of scrupulosyte.
som of our owne selfe. som byn carnall. som sprituall eche one of these hathe dyuerse remedyes.
For where he is suf+feryd feryd there is he a lyon. and where he ys resystyd not fearyd nor set by.
But yet knowe that no man may loke to be able of hym selfe to resyst or wrastell with the enemy.
syth there ys no power vpon erth able to be co~paryd to his power.
Therfor temptacion must be resistyd by grace prayer and good workes.
The fowle thoughtes of ye lustes of the body must be fled and had in abhomynacion dysdaynynge that oure soule yt is dedicate to god. shulde be occupyed wyth suche. syth our hartes shulde euer be kepte clene. as the chambre mansion of our sayd lorde.
In the whiche we be taughte a remedy ageyn impaciency. to suffre not to reuenge our owne quarel And lyke wyse to resyst the mocions of pryde and vaynglory.
Thus euerychone of these maner of temptacions. haue eyr propre remedyes.
BVT for as moche as the spirituall temptaci+ons be more suttell paynefull and comonly more parlous therfore our pore purpose now ys. to shew how suche may come what remedyes for them.
These temptacions be as mocions of infidely+te mocions of desperacion.
And amonge all other note after doctours one special maner yt they may com of Isoder sayeth.
The enemy when he wold de+ceyue man he fyrst co~syderyth of what co~plexion he is.
And so applyeth his ordynaunce layeth sege to manes soule where he fyndeth hym most weke. and appte ta receyue his suggestions.
And pope Leo in a sarmon of the Natyuyte of our lorde sayeth thus.
The cursyd aduersary our au~cient goostly enemy co~syderyth the state of euery {per}son ceassyth neuer ne fayleth to sprede cast euery where the snares of his deceytes euer labouryth to corrupte the trew fayth of the beleuyng soules.
He knowyth full wele to whome he may apply the vnsaciable appetyte of couetousnes.
And to whome he may suggest ye soule abhomynable desyres occasyo~s of Glotony and Lechery.
And whome he may inspyre with his most venemous poyson of Ire and enuy. whome he may deceyue with false ioye. and make them prowde and vaynglorious or by admyracion and maruelynge of outwarde thynges to seduce and lede them from the waye of grace and parfeccion.
He knoweth sayeth thys noble Clarke whome he may trouble wyth pensysnes. whome he may oppresse wyth fere.
All hys laboure dylygence study busynes ys to way co~syder serche the maners co~dicions customes disposicio~s of man wherfore when he knowith that a parson is disposyd to be scrupulous fearefull in conscience.
Anone he wyll moue his body cause a fume to ryse vp to his hed. trouble his senses and so darke reson. then he hathe broughte hym in to a grete trouble.
The~ by bis subtyl craftes he wyl make hym byleue that he hathe no faythe that all he dothe is noughte.
And yt is not so for all this ys by cause reson is darkyd may not se hym selfe. nor dis+cusse suche thynges as parteyneth to his saluacion.
And that the enemy knowyng though he can not ouercome hym yet he wyll trouble hym wery hym. as doctours sayeth. dryue hym to that poynte. yf he can that he shall be wery to suffre payne for hys synnes for the loue of Iesu crist.
In whiche yf the faythfull soule resyst hym be not ouercom.
but pa+ciently suffer all his craftes paynes troubles certaynly that soule dothe meryt greatly byldyth his hye crowne of glory. to the great confusion of ye ene+my.
which synned fell without eny suche occasion or payne. but only of his fre wyll.
But yf a soule wyl be weake faynt and not strongly call for grace to resyste hym: Anone he wyl lay greter sege to hym. assayle hym with more temptacions.
He wyl brynge hym to anguysshe of spirit whiche is a spu~all pensy+uenes.
And that parlous payne he wyl by darkyng of his reason bryng hym to yet a greter payne. that is to say. to tediousnes of lyfe.
And there vpon next he wyl if he be not resysted moue hym to desperacio~ whiche is the vttermost that he may do. in the soule yt louyth god.
For certaynly. though he may brynge his owne saruantes. suche that louyth the worlde better then god to forther co~fusion: yet.
ye saruantes of god. and the elect chosen vessels of grace he may neuer fynally confou~de in that temptacion nor in any other as saynt Gregory sayeth in the seco~de boke of his morals.
am so maruelously troublyd some tyme that me thynketh am lefte forsaken of god and all hys aungells holy sayntes. and am as yt were a thynge that were ta+ken delyuerid to the enemy for my synnes.
haue no swetnes nor deuocio~ but all my lyfe is as yt wer a tediousnes all swetnes deuocion is taken from me.
And as a thynge lefte dry without merues to nothynge apte nor disposyd that is goostly.
And that bryngeth me to suche feare that may trust hope of no ioy in heuen nor eny thyng that is good in erth. but only loke for dampnacion.
Ah. holy soul and yf thou wyst what these paynes doth profyt the thou woldest haue a mery spryt a lyght harte.
For certaynly other these greate temptacions byn only payne to the.
If they byn only payne: knowe thou for cartaynte that they byn no syn.
Syn is so volu~tary. that if yt be not volu~tary yt is no syn. as doctours sayeth.
what so euer temptacio~ man suffre yf he co~sent not yt is no syn but only payne meryt. specially in these spu~all temptacio~s. whiche ben ageynst fayth and hope.
this is our glory this is ou+re vyctory: our moste strong myghty fayth. in Ie+su cryste. whiche knowyth his saruantes and electe chyldren better then they know them selfe He know+yth that leuer they had to suffre dethe as martyrs. than they wolde breke or gyue ouer or co~sent to the enemy in suche temptacions paynes. whome ther+fore he putyth for the tryall meryt in these greate paynes. by cause theyr crowne glory shulde be the more hye in heuen.
And certeynly theyr payne were a kynde of martyrdom if they wolde suffre yt gladly as holy martyrs dyd fuffer dethe for the loue of Iesu crist.
But for as moche as eny parson is not ly+ke stronge in fayth hope the holy loue of god: ne+cessary yt is to shew som remedyes co~fortes how holy fathers byfore vs hathe behauyd themselfe in suche temptacions.
we shuld behaue our self otherwyse then in carnall temptacions.
For in carnall tempta+cions we oughte to make stronge resystence euer wrastell ageynst them.
but we may not do so in spu~all temptacions. wysely dyscretly we must resyste them but in no wyse wrastell wyth them.
when the enemy putyth to you a mocion of infydelyte reason not with hym and lyke wyse when he castyth a sug+gestion of desperacion stryue not with hym. but vse this medecyne.
as the mocion co~yth so let yt passe without stryfe.
If it be only of ye disposicion of our corrupte nature this is sufficient yf yt be vsyd.
If yt com of the enemy he wyll not leue you so.
Dyssymul shew your selfe to set lytel by it or nought. though ye thyng be grete And lyfte vp youre mynde to god. remembre hys tendre marcy in the redempcion of man how yt is his ordenau~ce in suche te~ptacions paynes to proue his saruantes. to whome he entendith to gyue ye crowne of glory.
But yf ye enemy be feerce wol not cesse for this.
as he is most subtyll crafty then me+ke your selfe vnto god. offer your selfe for his loue for the dew fruyte of penau~ce for your synes. glad+ly with thankes of hart to suffer al paynes that yt shall please his grace to sende you.
And wyth ye call crye with harte voyce on the holy name of Iesu .x. tymes. or more or lesse as your deuocion saruith with som holy swete meditacio~ of reuerence to the same as god shall put in to your mynde.
This verteu of mekenes confessyon of the name of Iesu in harte worde ye enemy may not abyde.
For though for a lytel tyme he wol pretende and semble as yf he were not abasshyd for that verteu and name as the sarpent that scripture spekyth of. whose property ys for the tyme to stoppe his erys yet by the wordes of the enchanter in conclusion she is ouercom taken.
So the enemy though he wol not be a knowen ther+of but som tymes more fersly he wol make insurrec+cio~ after that holy name Iesu be spoken.
yet certeyn+ly that holy name namyd he is ouerthrowen ther+fore strongly parsew hym with the same with mekenes he shall fle with grete co~fusion to the grete comfort of all them that abydyth as treu seruantes parseuerant in this theyr profe to theyr greate tryumphe and to the vtter confusion of the enemy.
certayne parson ther was that by ye space of .ii. yeres more.
was troubelyd wyth suche mocions often tymes by water by lande.
he had mocions to desperacion to the moste abhomynable that may be to distroy hym selfe. bothe by water otherwyse.
And the {per}son neuer ceasyd. but callyd to god dayly parseuerantly to stre~gth hym. euer confessyng hymselfe the saruant worshyper of the holy name of Iesu. co~mytyng hymselfe only holly to ye passion of cryst marcy of oure lorde god.
And wythin the sayd tyme he had co~fort illuminacio~ in soule. how to answere the enmy to his gret co~fort. to ye edefiyng of other.
And yt was this yt was gyue~ hym by a light.
that when so euer suche mocion cam to his mynde. that he sulde take that mocion for an occasion remembraunce to honour the passion of crist the blyssed vyrgyn hys mother.
And yf it com to his mynde a .C. tymes in the day.
so ofte of ye same to take occasion reme~brance to say.
And to the mother of marcy one Aue maria. to the ende.
And thus that parson was clene delyueryd. to the greate encrease of hope in his soule.
¶An answere to the fyrste parte of the Co~playnt of the dulle soule.
BVT now to the co~playnt of the {per}son that ys troubelyd with mocions of desperacion.
And fyrst where he sayeth that his lyfe is as yt were a tediousnes.
For yf he may bryng hym to an heuynes of spryte to a dulnes and tediousnes: then hathe he in maner robbed hym. from ye zele quycke fervour of good workes spoyled hym of hys corage that he had to verteu woll make hym leue so~tyme hys dewtyes vndone other good workes to ye whiche he hathe bene accustomyd.
But this spu~all pensyue+nes tediousnes of spryte is causyd otherwyse in ye grete syners of the worlde and infydels heretikes otherwyse in the saruantes of god.
In the saruan+tes of the dyuell yt is causyd. when they haue ye con+dicions of theyr master.
somtyme of a synguler and proude mynde when a man p~ferryth his owne wyll mynde icion or cou~seyl before al other.
and also ageynst the co~mandement of god and is so obdura+te styffe in his opynion that he wyll folow no cou~seyl. neyther of hys prelate nor of eny other reuler.
Of thys we rede an example in the seconde boke of the Kynges of one called Achytofel whiche for that his cou~seyl was refusyd not folowyd.
Some tyme yt comyth of an enuyous mynde. when a man ys so replete wyth the poyson of Enuy.
that nether for god nor man he woll spare to reuenge.
Of thys we rede in the boke of quene Hester of one callyd Amon whiche so enuyed a ver+teous man callyd Mardocheus that he coulde non other wyse be contentyd but he wolde haue not on+ly the sayd Mardocheus but also all his nacio~ slay+ne on a daye. and all for that Mardocheus dyd not arise and do hym reuerence as other did.
But what fortunyd? suerly by the wyl of god the meanes of the fornamyd quene Hester whiche was Mardoche us brothers doughter. vpon the same galows that he let make for Mardocheus he was hangyd hymselfe. and Mardocheus with all hys nacion delyueryd.
Som tyme yt comyth of a malysyous cursyd wyll. a man wyll not calle for marcy to god. but volu~taryly wylfully seperat hym selfe.
from his mar+cy as dyd Iudas that betrayed our sauyoure.
And therfore from thys te+diousnes god kepe all cristen people.
¶Of an other cause maner thys forsayd tediousnes is causyd in ye saruantes of god As saynt Gregory wytnessyth in his moralles.
And that ys when the saruantes of god hathe foughten the batayl of verteu long seson exercysyd hymself wele in warkes of parfeccion and gostlynes.
After+warde he begynneth to be wery. to abate his dylygence and goostly corage that he had in resystynge temptacions and doyng good workes so gyueth place to the enemy whyche a non as ye aduarsary do the parceyue he parsewyth hym more craftely by many suttyl fraudes and suggestions mouyth hym to the forsayd gostly werynes tediousnes.
Ageyn the whiche we must vse these remedyes that folow+yth and apply all our enforce myghte to resyste remoue this sayd tediousnes For lyke as where the sarpent may get in her hed she wyl co~uey draw in her body shortly so wol he do.
Therfore let vs cut a way tediousnes from our harte as ye moste parlous hed of the sarpent the dyuell.
For yf he may obteyne that vndoutyd he wol brynge vs to farther trouble Therfor when we be wery in goostlynes. let vs ren to the well of marcy fou~tayne of all co~fort oure lo+ueyng sauiour cryst Iesu. whiche hathe {pro}mysed to co~fort refresshe vs sayng.
Come to me al you that be ouerchargyd weryed in the grete labours yt ye haue taken for my loue.
shall co~forte releue defende you from all troubles delyuer you.
In me ye shall haue peace Let vs co~syder ye grete marcy tendre loue of that lorde whiche for our redempcion delyuerance ne+theyr sparyd body nor soule but strongly sufferyng the batell of tribulacion all paynes to ye vttermost neuer ceassyd to the ende but rendryd his most p~cyous lyfe for our saluacion.
Reme~bre also the holy ap+postles martyrs co~fessours vyrgyns and i~nume+rable holy fathers sayntes that faughte the same batayl.
Lyfte vp the eye of your soule to heuen. co~+syder ye crowne of glory.
whiche our sayd lord hathe p~paryd for his saruantes. holdyth yt in his hande as most sure redy to those {per}sons ye parseuer fyght+yng this batayl to ye ende.
Loke also downe to hell. co~syder wheter ye be able to stusteyne the paynes ordenid for ye contra+ry For them mene yt begynneth good workes do not {per}seuer to ye ende.
These well consyderyd may be an occasion to remoue all tediousnes and dulnes of spirit.
vse thys remedy when ye be dysposyd to dulnes of spyryt applye youre selfe to some workes bodely or gostly. that ben to the honoure of god. though in the doynge of them ye haue deuocion.
And specially ofte amonge. vse these holy Psalmes Iudica me deus et discerne causam meam.
And in this excercyse the enemy may not abyde. but seyng that ye more he te~ptyth ye more the saruante of god dothe {pro}fyt in good workes as vtterly co~fou~dyd for that tyme he wol departe and cesse his temptacion to the great co~fort goostly experience of the sayd parson and many noo.
¶An answere to the seconde parte of the complaynt of the dul soule where she com+playneth that all swetnes deuocion is taken from her she lefte all dry with out merites.
WHere the sayde parson also sayeth that all hys deuocion and swetnes is taken from hym and he as a thynge that were forsaken.
He thynkyth that all ye dedes that he hathe done be noughte rather be syn. the~ good workes and yt is not so but all is illusyon crafte of the enemy whiche after yt he hath darkyd reason as is said before then he wol begyn to clatter in the fantasy of man.
For as Origen sayeth vpon Luke Man hathe .ii. aungels deputyd to hym one good and an other yuel.
And if good thoughtes be in our harte and Iustice in our warkes then our good au~+gell spekith to vs. co~trary when yuell thoughtes dothe abyde roote in our hartes then the aungell of the dyuell spekyth to vs.
And some tyme he wole (as saynt Paule sayeth) transfygure hymselfe and appere as an au~gell of lyghte.
And vnder the colou+re of verteu good thinges he wol deceyue the sym+ple soule suche as haue not ye experience of his subtyl craftes.
he hathe apperyd in ye symylytude of criste. as we haue many examples.
and by a false vayne ioye he hathe deceuyd them that hathe ben gyuen to greate {per}feccion.
And more ouer yt is to feare syth he is so proude hathe so grete re+bellyon to god. and suche malyce enuy to man. yf he were suffryd he wolde not spare to cou~terfet the voyce parson of god omi~potent and speake suche or other lyke wordes in the {per}son of god.
As yt were god that spake and signyfy and say thou art abhomynable by syn. thy grace is gon thou hast cast thy selfe vtterly from me therfore wol no more rece+ue the to my grace thou art dampnyd.
whome yf god wolde suffre so to do: yt shulde be to the greate glory try+umphe of his saruant whiche beyng but as a worme of the erth in maner in co~parison of the enemy yet by ye grace of god ys able to ouercom hym all his craftes. to his vtter co~fusion.
For he lost the said glory without any suche temptacion or dyssuasion.
He wyl also somtime speke to vs in the voyce of our owne co~science specially when we be darked in our reason say.
My fayth is vnstable and not trew. it is but fayned my hope ys not vpwarde as yt shuld be.
wol despayre how may loke for heuen. that consentes to euery delectacion. and do not resyst eny temptacion euer decay and fall from god.
Suche thoughtes and inumerable moo he wol speke in our soule as yt were oure owne conscience that shulde speke all is but hys crafte and suggestions.
So~tyme he wol speke in his owne dynellyshe parson cast his moste terryble engyns of fere in mannes soule to hys grete vnquietnes. and say thus.
Or if thou do thus thus shall bryng the to this co~fusion or that mystyef.
shall neuer leue the but euer {per}sew ye tempte the trouble the vnto haue brou+ghte the to hell.
And so~tyme he woll put hym in gre+te fere dayly vex hym for a seaso~ thoughe he may not ouercom hym. say If thou cease not from this worke or that worke thou shalt falle in this horryble syknes as the falyng syknes the frensy ye pawl+sey or the pestylence.
On this maner he spake to the holy father saynt Francys but he set nothyng therby. but prechyd the more not withstandyng his sut+tyll suggestions.
And also to saynt Martyn sayd that he wolde neuer leaue hym whyther so euer he went.
but he feryd not his thretenyng but said thus Du~s mich adiutor non timebo vias tuas.
These thynges though they byn terryble to euery man yet they be moste vexacion to the ferefull scrupulous {pro}son whose co~science by cause of the feare doutfulnes of the same. semyth to consent to suche yet yt is not so.
Of these terryble suggestions mocion feares the prophete Dauid spekyth in hys psame where he sayeth and prayeth on thys wyse.
Good lord graciously here my prayer delyuer me from the fere of myne enemy In an other place also he sayeth.
Contristatus su~ in excercitacione mea a voce inimici. &c. Blyssyd lorde am sore vexyd in myne excercyse thorow the voyce of myne enemy.
And in the .xl. psalme also Inimici mei dixeru~t mala michi.
Myne enemyes hathe spoken to me. most teryble yuel ferefull wordes. vpon the whiche terte saint Austyn askyth what enemyes byn these.
These enemyes byn ye da~pnyd spirites whiche somtyme with ferys so~tyme with false ioyes troubelyth the saruantes of cryste.
But let neuer ony {per}son or parsons be feryd of suche suggestions that wold sarue god. hathe a mynde therto thoughe they be darkyd in reason somtyme.
nor se them selfe nor theyr actes ne lyfe that they haue led in tyme paste.
For ther is nothyng more necessary to ma+ke a man know that of hymselfe he is noughte then these paynes that all hys helpe co~fort strengthe is of god.
But suche a soule yt is in trouble payne of te~ptacion yf he cleue in harte to god. call to his marcy he shall neuer be ouercom.
In all anguyshe of spy+rite te~ptacion how moche so euer thy senses reso~. thoughtes dedes ben darkid seme not swete nor meritorious as long as in the bottom of thy harte roote of thy wyll thou lelyst a co~trary inclinacion that thou woldest not consent for any thyng that suche te~ptacions byn paynfull to the not pleasure nor volutaryly desyryd. so longe thou arte safe and not ouercom in that te~ptacion.
that in suche anguyssnes of spyrit yf thou but suspyre or sygh vp to god for marcy thou art safe in soule.
But as saynt Thomas sayeth better yt were to dyspyse them for that is a token of greate grace.
Euery man sayeth this noble doctour yt resystyth wrestelyth with te~ptacion ouercomyth it not.
but he ouercomyth temptacion yt dispisyth yt caryth not for yt. but rather offeryth hym selfe to yt all other wylfully gladly for ye loue of god for the purgacion of his owne synnes.
And suche a {per}son in wrestlyng resystyng or ouercomyng te~ptacion dothe moche meryt.
but in the en+force laboure of ye comau~deme~t of god. accordyng to the i~clynacion of grace charite.
For som tyme ye soule yt hathe more grace hathe lesse swetnes faruoure than he that hathe lesse grace.
that better yt is somtyme more meryt to haue a wyll clerely by fayth to beleue and to haue a wyll strongly to hope in god and to haue a wyll with en+forse and laboure of harte faruently for to loue god more meryt may be.
than wythout difficulty somtyme to haue the vse of these forsayd vertues as we wolde and after our owne wyll.
And this is not only the sayng of Gerson but yt ys also the comendetermynacion of doctours.
Therfore neuer drede ne care what the enemy speake in youre soule. for as saynt Thomas sayeth. know ye for a certaynte that he can nother create thought nor directly cause any thought in youre mynde but as we gaue example a fore of the vessell with muddy watter.
he may be oc+casion of dyuerse thoughtes in oure mynde.
he may moue touche the instrumentes of the sensys. and by the occasion therof. troble the fantasy and inclyne yt to ymagyn many and diuerse thynges by the reson wherof the reson of man for nye amyte and affinite. that yt hathe with the fantasy considerith the same and so yt ys to be vnderstondyd that we sayd before how the enemy dyd clatter and speake in the fantasy soule of man and none otherwyse after this notable clarke saynt Thomas.
On thys maner he wll speke amonge in the tyme of the saruice of god. and enclyne vs by hys suggestion to consydre thynges mat+ters harde spoken seen thought or wrought in all the processe of our lyfe though byfore they were not in our mynde and also moue vs to discusse our lyfe past and oure confessions say they be not suffyciently made by cause he wolde let oure mynde from our dewry. somtyme he woll {per}swade and entyse vs to vayneglory.
after resystyng of te~ptacion or other holy meditacion and prayer.
and stronge in god. ye haue ouercome me ye maye be glad and reioyse in harte that can fasten no te~ptacion on you.
But for al suche cautels false deceytes of the enemy kepe you euer in meke+nes.
Do youre dewty as youre helthe woll suffre to the vttermoste. and care not for them.
And all be yt that he saye ye haue no me+rittes ye be a syner. offer to you mocions of infide+lyte. of despayre. reson not wyth hym in any wyse. pages missing] reuyue. and com to hym selfe.
Antony consyderyng where he was seyng the co~pany yt was presente a+boute hym. espyed his disciple pryuely made hym a sygne to com to hym said.
And so done he cryed prouoked the dyuels to com ageyn sayng.
am the saruant of Iesu criste. do what ye can.
The dyuels not beryng this grete co~fusy+on and dispyte. thoughte how they myght reuenge themselfe. gatheryng a great multitude to gether transformyd them in to the similytudes lyknes of dyuers bestys. so apperyd to hym ageyn whome when he sawe.
Anon he was lyghtnid with ye lyghte of the holy goste. sayd to them.
se now ye fere my lorde Iesu cryste. for one of these bestes in whose symylitude ye haue transformyd your selfe were able to deuoure me yf yt were the wyll of my lorde Ihu~ crist. but now all the worlde may know that ye may nothyng do of your selfe but as ye be lycensyd and {per}myttyd of my lorde Iesu crist.
In wose name de+fye you all so they confou~dyd euanysshed a way.
lorde where hast thou byn so long? And he answeryd sayd.
But semyd to wythdrawe my selfe for ye myght {pro}ue how strongly thou woldest fyght for my loue.
And now for that se thou hast acquit thy selfe wele played ye man.
shall make thy name to be knowen thorow out all ye worlde wherfore. let ne+uer man thynke that he ys forsaken of god. but as the prophete sai sayeth yt ys but as a lytell poynt or prycke.
an instant or moment of tyme. in ye which god prouyth man. semyth to torne the most fauora+ble and swete cou~tenance of his most blessyd vysage from man to semble as he had indignacion were sore displesid with man.
And all is be cause in a lytle poynt he wol {pro}ue hym. that euer more he may haue marcy on hym.
And thus to be lefte of almighty god no faythfull saruant of god shulde disdayne syth on the same maner the son of god. in our nature hangyng on the crosse dyd call try to his eternal father sayng.
he can see nothyng but his dampnacion and so to fall to despayre.
what thou say est vsurpe not the power of god.
Take not on the to discusse the vnscrutable iudgementes of god.
wol grau~te to the yt in tyme and place it is good a man to reme~bre dampnacion in his meditacion to recou~t with him selfe as he were byfore ye iudgement of god reme~bryng his synnes. the iustice of god. the paynes of hell dew for syn suche other.
But in this beware dyffyne nothynge nother for thy selfe ne yet for eny other.
For yf thou despayre. or decre thyn owne da~pnacion. thou vsurpyst to dyffyne ye moste secrete sentence of god. whiche au~gell in heuen doth not know but only yt is resaruyd to god.
Also thou doest moch iniury to god in mystrustynge his marcy. thou makest hys marcy no more in thy corrupte fantasy or mynde then is the marcy of man.
or au~gel. wher the marcy of god ys infynite hathe no ende what spekist thou man of synnes.
As this noble clarke Gerso~ sayeth yf thou hadest shed all the cristian me~nes blo+de that hathe byn shed from the incarnacion of our lorde to this howre. haueyng repentau~ce with a wyl to be co~fessyd and contryte for one supplycacion for marcy thou mayst be sauyd and opteyne forgyfnes of god. why thynkest thou.
that our most marcyfull sauiour Iesu dyd chuse to his singular famylyarite.
Zache. mari Magdalen and mary the Egipcian the thefe and blasphemar that honge on his right syde. wyth i~numerable mo grete syners. that now byn holy saintes in heuen. but only that thou shuldest neuer despayre.
but euer co~myt ye to the marcy of god. to his blyssyd passio~.
Or what spekyst thou of merites? syth the wydow that offrid but .ii. mytes was more alowyd. then they yt offryd most of all.
for god recou~tyth not the workes so moche as he dothe the wyll. where is in case no nother possybylyte.
ye merites of the passio~ of crist is sufficient for vs all.
The infantes that byn new borne cristenyd that neuer dyd good dede. in the merites of the passion of criste byn sauyd.
saye not but gret multitude no~bre of merites byn good but grace whiche makyth man partener of ye passion of cryste ys sufficient.
Master Duns sayeth. that he merityth moche that in te~ptacion lesyth not ye grace that god hathe gyuen hym.
And Gerson sayeth that he hathe grete merites that hathe the passion of crist a good wyll to do well.
He that hathe these .ii. hath grete merites good suerty and neuer nedyth to be ouercom of ye enemy.
In suche a tyme as he was in greate ieobardy of deth by syknes the enemy cam temptyd hym in desperacion mouyd hym fyrste to co~syder hys lyfe and neglygences the holy man sawe there in moche neglygence and then the enemy dyd tempte hym farther sayd what good dedes or merytes haste thou done in thy lyfe or what is all thou hast done in co~parison to ye grete inestimable bene+fyt of glory.
And he as euer he was meke thoughte all his dedes noughte so began to fere. and fall to despayre.
But anon the holy gooste did lyghten hym gaue hym his answere.
know that my lorde Iesu hathe dew right to the kyngdom of heuen by .ii. tytles. one ys by his naturall enheritance syth he is ye eternal son of god.
nother title he hathe by the merites of his blyssid passion.
whiche he suffryd not for hym selfe but for me and all mankynde that is sufficiente for me.
Thus in our dethe suerty we haue to rest to the passion of crist. whiche is a saue co~ducte to all that trustyth therin.
For our blyssyd lorde ys so marcyfull as our sayd lorde shewyd to oure holy mother saynt Birgitt by reuelacion. tenderly he louyth the shepe of hys folde. that yf yt were possyble for hym to dye for eche one of them a speciall dethe. suche as he ons did suffre on the crosse for all mankynde rather then he wolde lose them or eny of them he wold suffre the said special deth to redeme them.
Syth he sufferyd dethe for mankynde when we wer all his enemyes.
what wol he do now for vs yt he hathe so dere boughte.
with his preciouse blode. and made vs his owne chyldren by adopcio~ of grace suerly rather then he wolde leue vs yf yt were possy+ble accordyng to the reuelacion he wolde dye for vs ageyne.
But syth he wolde do thys for euery crysten man.
what thynke ye he wyl do for them that leuyth the worlde and forsakyth them selfe for hys loue and geuyth themselfe holly to hym. as al holy relygiouse {per}sons.
Of whome wote not what may say syth they be so appropryed to god. that they be only hys. and none others (As saint Anselme saith) they must nedes haue more marcyfull iugement at hys hande then any other.
No man sayeth thys holy Doctour dothe iuge his owne mo+re streygtly than he dothe that. whyche parteynyth to a nother. wherfore all suche may haue grete comfort in oure lorde stngly for his loue to wythstond temptacion.
by an example that rede of an holy father that ouercame the enemy.
and vtterly in maner confou~dyd hym. by grace and good wysdom For when the enemy wolde tempte hym to pryde he wolde wyth all hys myghte enforse hym to mekenes when he mouyd hym to yre or wrothe then he apply+ed hymselfe strongly to pacience.
And so. lykewyse from Glotony he wolde declyne to abstinence and when he temptyd hym to desperacion: he wolde com+myt hymselfe to the marcy of god and apply hymselfe to hope.
And lykewyse also when he wold temp+te hym to scrupulosite feare of conscience: then he wolde enforse hymselfe all to gyther to charite. and to the holy loue of god. whiche holy loue when yt is parfyt yt excludith all synystre fearys yuel dredys.
¶A conclusion of this Treatyse exhorteynge euery parson to the loue of god The .xx. Chapitre.
AND for a fynall conclusyon of thys treatyse exhorte euery relygiouse parson to behaue themselfe. apply them specially to the loue of god. for therin restyth all parfeccion.
where holy loue ys. there is only merit and where it is not there is euer errour and presu~pcion.
If shall watche pray fast do almes dedes kepe sylence abstinence syght and contynence.
If had all the knowlege and graces. to do miracles saieth saint Paule with all other par+feccions haue not charyte whiche ys the holy loue of god.
All these said parfeccions must be vsid with a mesure but the holy loue of god. as saynt Austyne sayeth hathe no measure.
who may haue this holy loue and reuernt famy+lyaryte with oure blyssyd lorde yf the spouses of the said lorde haue yt not.
Rede and ye shall neuer fynde that oure sauyoure cryste Iesus hathe shewyd more familyarite than to holy virgyns and wydowes as to saynt Kateryn ye martyr to our holy mother saynt Byrgyt saynt Clare saynt Kateryn of sene with ma+ny other whyche he spousyd to hys grace.
they wylfully forsakeyng the pompe of the worlde for his ho+ly loue.
Thys loue is co~paryd to the oyle that the folysshe vyrgyns specyfyed in the Euangely had not.
what avaylyth yt to haue lampes and haue no oyle.
So lyke wyse what auaylyth yt to haue soulles as vessels apte to grace not to haue the oyle of grace to replenysshe them. whyche oyle ys the holy loue of god.
Therfore deuoute systers yf ye knowe any par+sons dysposyd to Scrupulosyte and seruyle feare. counseyll and exhorte them in oure Lorde. all suche seruyle and synystre fearys secludyd and put a way holly and only to apply them selfe to be garnysshyd with the holy feare and reuerence of god and wyth his blyssyd loue.
For in these .ii. begynneth endyth all parfeccion. and these .ii. ioyneth the soule of man or woman to oure lorde sauiour criste Iesu. whose blyssyd loue hathe mouyd vs to begyn thys blyssyd treatyse as a directory of the co~science. whiche poure exhortacio~ is only after the mynde of these forsaid holy Doctours.
And thus we ende the sayd treatyse in the holy loue of oure sayde Lorde.
To whome be euer all honoure holy reuerence and loue of harte wythout ende.

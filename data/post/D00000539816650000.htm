a hue and cry after a jacobite or louisian and a true character to know and distinguish him

licensed august the th

a jacobite or louisian is a certain animal of the doubtful gender with an english face a french heart a jesuits conscience and an irish valour a creature with a a thick skull hair brains bogtrotting feet supple hams and arms
he prusues the last syllable of his name to bite and stab a christian to the heart and afterwards begs his pardon that he was mistaken assuring that no more blood till he has another opportunity shall be shed upon his account

he displays a red banner with the device or motto of ninny mac nero jemy transub to shew that he maintains the cause of the scarlet whore but is grown of late so wonderful bashful at the approach of an enemy that he avoids and shuns his company as beggers do a yet he boasts that he is of the race of noddites and retains the principles of cain the murderer and bears the arms of issachar being an ass couchant and seems descended from esau being so ready to truck away an invaluable birth right of liberty and property for a french kickshaw and a nauseous mess of irish pottage he stiles himself an english man yet acts in all things as antipodes to his native countrey and pretends high and swears god dam him he is of the church of england but as he understands not her doctrine so he dishonors her by his lewd conversation and is look'd upon by his parishoners as a thief who secretly steals himself therein to give opportunity to let his complotters in to rob the house
he is a grab protestant that crawls backwards towards ireland or at best the cars foot which the romish monkeys makes use of to pull their sinking cause out of the fire

this creature is a protestant in masquerade a jesuits advocate a popish sollicitor a king james votary and tho they load him like asses with burthens has not the wit to foresee they only put upon him to do their drudgery and must expect polyphemus

courtesie to be devoured the last to talk soberly with him of religion he flaps you over the mouth with fanaticism and faction and confutes you with the appellation of confounded whigg and tho he was one of the first that assisted in endeavouring our bless'd reformation pursuing those wild boars that would have rooted up the constitution and break the ballance of our happy government yet for want of the gratification his ambitiom aim'd at turns a grumbletonian rebel to king william sowing the tares of sedition but will reap hemp in exchange and the hangman will have the cutting of many of them of the simples his discourse is all sham noise and nonsence whose wit and courage bears equal force with that of his cause
his breeches are empty of cash to cheat the withall
whereby you may know him by the chalk on peoples doors and that he is certain in nothing but breaking of his word

in fine a true jacobite is transubstantiated into a state catterpiller which devours every green thing in a flourishing kingdom being far more pernitious and destructive to this british isle then the locusts and caterpillers were to egypt for they stab liberty and property to the very heart that themselves like beasts of prey may wholly live upon spoile and rapine fit subjects only for nebuchadnezzar to herd with the wild asses in the desert to tell a first rate jacobite of the glorious progress of king william arms against the enemie in ireland

he replies what's that to the success of the fleet and the designs of that invincible monarch the grand lewis who with his missionary draggoons is on the coast to settle both the protestant religion and king james in the throne to ask him who shall adventure to put the chain about the lyons neck when he comes amongst us he'll answer we ought to trust providence and consider of that afterwards preaching up the doctrine of jure and passive obedience and has the vanity to cajole us that the french king will religiously preserve both our liberties and our laws using the protestants with the like tenderness as his own subjects meaning the hugonots but he is grown of late so squeemish that a lawful oath strangely disturbs his maw but on a sudden the muligrubs have violently possessed him and is taken with a fit of singing lacrymae to his cause the truth is to miscarry thus in projects would make a priest a loosing gamster
but chears and bouys himself up with the glimmering prospect of a french descent tho tis not in the least doubted the destruction they design for this nation will revert upon their own heads and then their boasted loyalty will extend no farther then a few drunken healths turning rebel to the idol they set up for let him roar and swagger what he can he'll continue no farther faithful than as his prince drops his pence for its not the cause like that of old hodg but the crust he barks for

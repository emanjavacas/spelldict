THE DVTIES OF CONstables, Borsholders, Tythingmen, and such other lowe ministers of the Peace.
that manie well disposed men doo earnestly wish, that some one short and plaine collection might be made of the dueties of high Constables, petie Constables, Borsholders, Tythingmen Headborrowes, and such like inferiour ministers of the Quéenes Maiesties peace, to the end that when any of them should be called to any of the said offices (or the like) they might the better behaue themselues in doing the same: haue thought it a thing woorthie the labour, to send abroad among them this little treatise, which haue drawne to satisfie in some part their honest desire:
hartilie praieng vnto God, that as their knowlege may be increased in the reading hereof, so also their diligence may be amended in the practise of the same, to the setting forth of the glorie of God, and to the aduancement of the Quéenes Maiesties seruice in this behalfe.
And bicause purpose (by the helpe of God) to make this worke so short, and so plaine withall, as the matter therof it selfe will suffer me, and as the vnderstanding of vnlearned men doth require: will first speake somewhat, both of the sundrie names and beginnings of these officers, and then afterward will go in hand with the parts of their seuerall duties.
The sundrie names of Constables, or high Constables that be of Lathes, Rapes, Wapentakes, Hundreds, and Franchises: and the diuers names also of Constables, petie Constables, Tythingmen, Borsholders, Boroeheads, Headboroes, chiefe pledges, and such other (if there be any) that beare office in townes, parishes, hamlets, tythings, or boroes (for of Constables of Castels, otherwise called Castellanes, and such
others meane not to intreate) are all in effect but two, that is to say, Constables and Borsholders: for these two words do containe as much as all the rest of those names, and to these two may al the rest of them be wel brought: and therefore, in speaking seuerally of these two, will passe along, and touch all the rest also.
is made (as haue read) of two English words put togither, namely, Cuning) or Cyng) and Staple, which doe signifie, the stay (or hold) of the king.
For by the ancient custome of this realme, there is a great officer called the Constable of England, who by meanes of the great auctoritie that he had, was a principall staie vnto the Kings gouernement:
and this man had iurisdiction and auctoritie in déedes of Armes, and in matters of war, both within and without the Realme.
Out of which office, this lower Constableship was at the first drawn and fetched, and is (as it were) a verie finger of that same hand.
For the statute of Winchester which was made in the time of King Edward the first, and by which these
lower Constables of hundreds Franchises were first ordained, doth (amongst other things) appoint, that for the better kéeping of the peace, two Constables in euerie Hundred and Franchise, shoulde make the view of Armour.
So then, the name of Constable in a hundred or franchise doth meane, that hee is an Officer that supporteth the Queenes Maiestie in the maintenance of hir peace, within the precinct of his hundred, or franchise: and he is manie times called the High Constable, in comparison of the Constables, or Petie Constables that be in the townes or parishes within his hundred or franchise, whose part it is likewise to maintaine the peace within the seuerall limits of their owne townes or parishes.
As touching Borsholder, which is the other generall name and doth containe within it the of Tythingmen, Borrowheades, Headborrowes, Thirdborrowes, and chiefe pledges, that also is made vp of these two English worde, Borhes, and Ealdor; of the which, Borhes betokeneth pledges, and Ealdor signifieth the Chiefe, the Head,
or the Elder: and so Borhesealdor in one word, doth meane the chiefe, or head of the suerties, or pledges.
that you may the better vnderstand what is ment by this, you must further know, that euerie of these Borsholders, Tythingmen, Borrowheads, Headborrowes, Thirdborrows, and chiefe pledges, hath two seuerall offices at this day: the one being his ancient and first office, and the other his latter made office.
by the ancient lawes of this realme (before the comming in of King William the Conquerour it was ordeined for the more sure kéeping of the peace, and for the better repressing of théeues robbers, that al frée borne men should cast themselues into seuerall companies, by ten in ech companie: and that euery of those ten men of the companie, shuld be suertie and pledge for the of his fellowes: so that if any harme were done by any of these ten against the peace, then the rest of the ten should be amerced, if he of their companie that did harme should flie, were not forthcomming
And for this cause these companies be yet in some plates of England (& namelie with vs in Kent called Boroes of the said word Borhes, Pledges or Suerties: albeit in the westerne parts of ye realme they be commonly named Tythings, bicause they conteine (as told you) the number of ten men with their families.
And euen as ten times ten do make an hundred, so, bicause it was then also appointed that tenne of these companies should at certeine times méete togither for their matters of greater waight, therefore that generall assemblie (or court) was (and yet is) called a Hundred.
Furthermore, it was then also ordeined, that if any man were of so euil credit, that he could not get himselfe to be receiued into one of these Tythings or Boroes, that then he should be shut vp in prison, as a man vnwoorthie to liue at libertie amongst men abroad.
Now whereas euery of these Tythings (or Boroes did vse to make choise of one man among themselues, to speak and do in the name of them all: he was
therefore in some places called the Tythingman, in other places the Boroes Ealder (whom we now cal Borsholder in other places the Boroehead, or Headboroe, in some other places the Chiefe pledge, which last name doth plainelie expound the other thrée that are next before it: for Head or elder of the Boroes, chiefe of the Pledges be all one.
And in some shires, where euerie third borrow hath a Constable, there the officers of the other two be called Thirdboroes.
Moreouer, in these Tythings (or boroes) sundry good orders were obserued,
and amongst others these: first that euerie man at the age of
then, that no man should be suffered to dwell in anie towne or place, vnlesse he were also receiued into some such suertieship and pledge as is aforesaid.
Thirdly, that if anie of these pledges were imprisoned for his offence, that then he ought not to be deliuered without the assent of the rest of his pledges: againe, that no man might remoue out of one Tything (or Boroe to dwell in another, without lawful warrant in that behalfe: lastly,
that euerie of these pledges should yéerlie be presented and brought foorth, by their chiefe pledge at a generall assemblie for that purpose, which we yet (in remembrance thereof) do call the View of Franke pledge, or the Leete court.
Hitherto haue opened the ancient office of the Borsholder, Tythingman, and the rest, whereof also there is yet to this day some shew or remnant in our Leetes or Lawdaies: but if the verie substance thereof were thoroughly performed (as knowe no let, but that by law it may) then shuld the peace of the land be much better maintained.
As touching the later office that these Borsholders, Tythingmen, Headboroes Boroeheads, Thirdboroes, and chiefe pledges haue, it is in manner all one with the office of a Constable of a towne or parish, which is commonlie named a Petie Constable, or Vnderconstable, bicause he is a small Constable, in respect of the Constable of his Hundred, within whose limit he is.
For, as about the beginning of the reigne of King Edward the third, petie Constables were deuised in townes parishes
for the aide of the Constables of the Hundreds: so of latter times also, Borsholders, Tythingmen, Headborroes, and such like, haue béene vsed as petie Constables within their owne Borrowes and Tythings.
And yet not so vniuersally, but that some of them haue at this daie none other but their olde office.
For in some of the Westerne parts of Englande, you shall sée, that where there be many Tythingmen in one parish, there onelie one of them is a Constable for the Queene, and the rest doe serue but as the ancient Tythingmen did.
Now therefore, hauing spoken of the names and beginnings of these inferiour officers of the peace, let vs also come to the parts of their duties.
Forsomuch as a great and chiefe part of the duty both of these High Constables of Lathes, Rapes,
Wapentakes, Hundreds, and Franchises, and also of these Constables, Petie constables, Tythingmen, Borsholders, Borrowheads, Headborrowes, Thirdborrowes, chiefe pledges, such like ministers, by whatsoeuer other names they
be called in anie Townes, Parishes, Tythings, Borrowes, Hamlets, or other places of the Realme, doth consist in the maintenance of the Queenes Maiesties peace, wherin (as also in som other points) the power of them all is alike, and but one, within their seuerall limits and places of authoritie: therefore thinke it good to shew, first what their co~mon and equall dutie is in matters co~cerning the peace, either by their owne authoritie, or vnder the authoritie of others: then afterwarde to declare, what their common and like dutie is in some other things, not concerning the Peace: and lastly, to open those things wherein they haue a distinct and seuerall dutie one from another.
The Conseruation (or maintenance) of the Peace, standeth in thrée things, that is to saie, first in foreséeing that nothing be done that tendeth, either directlie, or by meanes, to the breach of the peace: secondlie, in quieting or pacifieng those that are occupied in the breach of the peace: and thirdlie, in punishing such as haue alreadie broken the peace.
And here least anie man should be deceiued in not vnderstanding what is ment by these words.
The breach of the peace, he must first of all know, that by the breach of the peace, is vnderstood, not onlie that fighting which we commo~lie cal the breach of the peace, but also that euery murder, rape, manslaughter, and felonie, whatsoeuer, and euerie affraieng, (or putting in feare) of the Queenes people, whether it be by vnlawfull wearing of armour, or by assembling of people to do anie vnlawful act, are taken to be disturbances or breaches of the peace.
for the better preuenting that nothing be done against the peace, anie of these officers aforesaide may take (or arrest) suspected persons, which walke in the night, and sléepe in the day: or which do haunt anie house, where is suspicion of bauderie: they may carrie them before a Iustice of the peace, to find suerties of their good behauiour.
And if anie such officer be not of sufficient strength to do that alone,
then may he take méet aid of his neighbours thereto: and they, in such cases, be compellable
Anie of these officers may also arrest such strange persons as doe walke abroad in the night season: and for that cause the said statute of VVinchester did ordaine,
that night watches shoulde be kept yéerelie, from the feast of the Ascension vntill Michaelmas, by six men at euerie gate of euerie citie, by twelue men in euerie Borough towne, and in euerie other towne by six men, or foure men, or according to the number of inhabitants in the towne, all the night long from Sunne setting to Sunne rising: so that if anie stranger did passe, he should be arrested till the morning, and then for at large (if no suspicion were found of him) but if anie suspicion fell out against him, then he shuld be imprisoned till he might be lawfully deliuered.
And of these watches, the officers before named haue the charge within the limits (or places) of their authorities as the Constable in his towne, the Borsholder in his Boroe, and the high Constable within al his Hundred: and these officers ought to sée these Watches duelie set and kept, and ought also to
cause Hue and Crie to be raised after such as will not obey the arrest of such watchmen.
Againe, if anie person whatsoeuer (except the Queenes seruants and ministers in hir presence, or in executing hir precepts, or their offices, or such as shall assist them: and except it be vpon Hue and Crie made to kéepe the peace, and that in places where actes against the Peace doe happen) shall be so bolde, as to go, or ride armed, by night, or by day, in Faires, Markets, or anie other places: then any Constable or any other of the saide Officers, may take such armour from him, for the Queenes vse, and may also commit him to the Gaole.
And therefore, it shall be good in this behalfe, for these officers to staie and artest all such persons as they shall find to carrie Dags, or Pistols, or to be apparelled with priuie coates, or dublets:
as by the Proclamation (made in the one and twentieth yéere of the reigne of our Souereigne Ladie that now is) they are specially commaunded.
or rumor of people be made in manner of insurrection, then the Shiriffes, Constables, and the said other ministers, hauing knowledge thereof, ought to go with the strength of the countie, and to set themselues against it, and ought also to take and imprison such offendors.
if any man do threaten to kill another, and he which is so threatened do praie anie of these Officers to arrest the other to find suerties of the Peace, then may such an officer arrest him to finde such suertie before a Iustice of the Peace, and may also carrie him to prison if he refuse to find it.
Thus much haue spoken of those things which doe bend towardes the breach of the peace:
but now will come nearer, to the breach it selfe, and withall to the pacifieng and punishing of the same.
If therefore a Constable, or anie other of the saide officers, shall sée anie men going about to breake the peace, as by vsing hot words, by which an Affray is like to grow, then ought such Officer to command those persons to auoid vpon paine of imprisonment: and if they
will not depart, but shal draw weapon, or giue anie blowe, then ought he to doe his best to depart them, to kéepe them in sunder: and he may (for that purpose) both vse his owne weapon,
In which doing, if any such officer, or other person comming on his part, doe take hurt, he shal haue good remedie by action against him that did the hurt: but if anie of them that made the Affraie, be hurt by such officer, or by any of his companie, then such a hurt person hath no remedie at all for it.
And if he that maketh an Affray doe flie into an house, when such an officer commeth to arrest him: then may that officer breake open the doores to take him: and if he that made the Affray do flie from thence also, yet may the Officer followe him, and in fresh suite take him, though it be in another Shire or Countie.
So, if two men be fighting togither in a house (the doores being shut) yet may such an Officer breake open the doores to cause the peace to be kept, though none of the parties haue taken hurt,
And in both these causes, such an officer may carrie them before a Iustice of the peace to finde Suertie for the peace, bicause they haue broken the peace alreadie, and are méete to be bound that they shall not thenceforth breake it againe.
haue receiued any dangerous hurt, then ought such Officer to arrest him that did the hurt, and to carry him to the Gaole, there to remaine till he find suertie to appéere at the next Gaole deliuerie: otherwise he may with lesse labour carrie him to a Iustice of the peace, who ought to take order for such suertie, bicause the fact may fall out to be Felonie, if so be that he which was hurt doe happen to die within one yéere and a day next following such hurt done.
And as these Officers ought to are rest those that doe make Assault vppon any priuate persons,
so also may they arrest any such as shall make assault (or Affray vpon themselues whilest they be in doing their offices: and may for that purpose both lawfully defende themselues, and also take the offendors and commit them to the Gaole, or carrie
them to a Iustice of the peace, for the finding of such suertie as is aforesaid.
But if one do assalt a man, in, or nigh the high way, to rob him, and be taken by the true man, or by any other, and be brought to the Constable, or such other Officer of the place: then ought such Officer, not onelie to take him to his warde, but also to carrie him before a Iustice of Peace to cause him to giue suertie for his Good abearing.
So, if any man do suspect another of Murder, or Felonie, and doe declare the same to any such Officer of the place, the~ such officer may arrest the suspected person, and he shall doe well to carrie him to a Iustice of the Peace togither with him that doth suspect him, to that end that they both may be examined as apperteineth.
Yea, any of the said officers may search within the limit of his authoritie,
for any persons suspected of Felonie: for it is a chiese part of their office to represse felons.
And therefore any of these Officers may (of his owne authoritie) arrest one that is indited of Felonie: So, if the common voice and fame be, that A. B.
hath done a felonie, that is sufficient cause for any of these Officers (that shall thereof suspect him) to arrest him for it.
that if information be giuen to any such Officer, that a man and a woman be in adulterie, or fornication togither, then the Officer may take companie with him, and that if he find them so, he may carrie them to prison.
that in the cases before, and such like, where such an Officer hath arrested, or hath in his ward any offendor that ought to be carried to the gaole, there such an Officer is not bound foorthwith to carrie him, but may wel for a reasonable time kéepe him in the Stocks, vntill that conuenient prouision of strength may be made to conuey him safely thither.
And when he shall bring such offendor to the gaole, then ought the Gaoler to receiue the same fréely, without taking any thing of the Officer for it.
Hitherto (as you sée) haue spoken of the Constable, and of these other Officers, so farre onely as they haue authoritie
But forsomuch as a great part of their dutie (concerning the peace) resteth in the making of due executio~ of the precepts of Higher officers, and specially of the Iustices of the peace, who be (as it were) immediately set ouer them, let vs also sée after what maner these Constables, and other the saide inferiour ministers of the Peace, ought to behaue themselues in that behalfe.
Albeit then, that these said Officers be subiect to the commandements of the Iustices of gaole deliuerie, and of Oier and Terminer, and of some Higher Iustices, yea, and to the precepts of Coroners also, and of other Officers, in some certeine cases, yet bicause most co~monly they are called vpon by the Iustices of Peace,
they ought specially to shewe themselues obedient to their precepts, and may not dispute whether their commandements be grounded vpon sufficient authoritie, or no: as knowing that although a Iustice of the Peace (which is a Iudge of Record shoulde direct a Warrant beyonde his authoritie to a
Constable, or one other of the saide Officers, yet shall such Officer be holden excused for executing the same, howsoeuer that Iustice of Peace himselfe bée blamed for it.
If therfore a Warrant for the Peace, or good abearing, happen to be directed to any of these said Officers, then ought he with all spéede and secrecie to finde out the partie: and then also may hée laie his hands vpon him, and shew him the matter, and require him in the Queenes name to go with him to put in suertie according to the Warrant.
And this if the partie shall refuse to doe, then ought such Officer foorthwith to arrest him, and to conueye him to prison, without carrieng him to any Iustice: in which doing, if the partie shall offer any resistance, or shall seeke to escape, then also may such Officer iustifie the beating, or the hurting of him.
But if the partie shall yéeld to go and giue Suertie,
and yet will not go to such Iustice as made out the Warrant, but to some other Iustice, then ought such officer to giue him that libertie, so
that it be not far out of the Limit, for else so great trauell might folowe vpon the Officer, as rather he than the offendor might séeme to be punished by it.
And here the Officer must take regard, and consider whether the Warrant doe come directly from the méere authoritie of the Iustices of Peace, or else be grounded vppon a writ of Supplicauit sent downe from higher authoritie (which difference ought to appéere plainely in all Warrants that be well and orderlie made.)
And if the Warrant be grounded vppon such a Writ, then may such Officer compell the partie to go to the very same Iustice or Iustices of Peace that made out the warrant, and otherwise he may carrie him to prison, as is said before.
Neither is it requisite, that such an Officer should danse vp and downe after the partie (as many vse to doe) vntil he can finde out suerties: but he may lawfullie kéepe him, vntill that he can get suerties to come vnto him: the ignorance of which point is the cause, both that many an euill man escapeth, manie an honest Officer is punished for it.
But here it happeneth many times, that the purtie (hearing that the peace is granted against him) offereth himselfe with suerties, for that cause vnto some other Iustice of Peace, or findeth such suertie in some of the Courts at Westminster, and so hath a Supersedeas ready to shew such Officer, as commeth to him with a Warrant as is aforesaide.
Now, if that be so, then is the Officer discharged thereby, and ought not any further to molest the partie.
But yet it shall be good, that such Officer doe kéepe the Supersedeas for his better discharge: least otherwise he be called to account for not seruing the Warrant that was sent vnto him.
If a Warrant be directed to a Constable, or such other Officer, to arrest our that is indited of Felonie,
then may such Officer iustifie the killing of such a partie, if it so be, that he cannot otherwise take him: or of so be, that he resist, or flie, when he is taken.
Finally, the Constable or such other of the said Officers, hauing arrested any to be conueied so the Gaole, must take good héed, that he doe not willingly, or
For, if the arrest were for Felonie, then by a willing escape the Officer himselfe becommeth a Felon also.
And of whatsoeuer other kinde the offence be, if the Officer do, by his will, or negligence, suffer the partie to escape from him, he shall be fined for it, according to the quantitie of his fault, by the discretion of those that shall be Iudges of it.
And least any such Officer shoulde flatter himself, in thinking that he may passe through with some easie Fine,
let him knowe, that the Iudges of his fault may set his fine, equall with the value of all his goods, if in their discretions the same doe so require.
Thus haue performed the first part of my promise, and haue shewed,
what is the equall and like dutie of euerie of the saide Officers in matters concerning the Peace, both by their owne authoritie, and also in dooing the co~mandements of the Iustices of peace: now therfore must go forward to the second part of my purpose, and am to declare their like dutie in other points of seruice, that doe not concerne the
For equal power is indifferently giuen to any of these Officers by som Statutes of the realme, whereof these that follow be the chiefe.
All Constables and other the said Officers ought to be attendant, aiding,
and assisting to the Iustices of Peace, for the execution of all and euerie the acts (made in, or before the Parleament, holden in the
yéere of the reigne of King Henrie the eight) concerning Reteinors, giuing of Liueries, Maintenance, Embracerie, Bowestaues, Archerie, Vnlawfull games, Forestallers, Regrators, Vittaile, Vittailers, and Inholders, or any of them, vppon paine that the said Constables, and other the saide Officers shall make such Fines, as by two of the said Iustices of Peace shal be assessed.
or within seauen miles thereof, ought (vpon request made, to aide and assist the President of the Colledge of the Physicians in London, and other persons authorized for the due execution of the Statutes made concerning Physicians, Apothecaries,
If any person shall (without lawfull bargaine) puruey or take any thing of any of the Queenes liege people,
to the vse of any (other than of the Queene and hir house) and thereof notice be giuen to the Constable, or such other Officer of the place, then such Officer ought (vnder the paine of twentie pound) to arrest such taker, and to carrie him to the next prison.
No Purueior of the Queene ought to take any horse, or cart, but by the deliuerie of the Maior, Bailife, Constable, or such other officer of the place whence that taking shall be.
Corne ought to be taken for the Queenes house, by striked measure of eight bushels to the quarter, according as is vsed throughout the land: and the takers of all things to be taken for the Queenes house, shall make their purueiance by the verie values thereof, by the viewe of the Constable, or other such Officer, and by appraisement vnder oth of foure other good men of the towne, where the taking shall be: and such taking shall be made without driuing
the preisors by compassion, menacing, or other villanie, to set any other price than their oth will, and as commonly runneth in the next Markets.
their Deputies, or seruants, shall not take any Beefes, Weathers, Lambes, Calues, or any kinde of Saltfish, or any kinde of graine, or any Butter in any vessels, or Cheese, Bacon, Conies, Pigs, Geese, Capons, or Hens, but by Commission, and a Blanke thereto for that shire annexed: in which Blanke, the said seueral things so to be taken, the prises of them shall be written, to which Blanke, the High Constable, Pety Constable, or Headborow of the place which any such taking shall be, ought to subscribe his name or signe manuell.
And such Taker ought then also to make a Briefe or Docket in writing subscribed with his name, conteining euerie of the saide things so taken in euerie place: and ought then also (vnder the paine of a Hundred Marks) to deliuer the same to the saide High Constable, Petie Constable, or Headborow, who also ought to deliuer it ouer to the Iustices of Peace at their next generall
In the takings for the Queenes house, Tailes (or Indentures) ought to be made and sealed, betwéene the taker and the owner (in the presence of the Constable, or such other officer, and the preisors of the place) by which Tailes (or Indentures) satisfaction ought to be made to the owner for his things so taken.
If any Taker will make purueiance of any thing (not excéeding the value of xl. s.) and make not readie paiment in hand therefore, it is lawfull for the owner to reteine the thing so taken, and to resist such purueiance: and the Constable, Tythingma~, or chiefe pledge of the place (being thereto required by the owner) ought to aide and assist such owner in making such resistance, vnder paine to yéeld vnto him the value of the thing taken, his double dammages.
or such other officer, of any place, be negligent, and doe not his best indeuour, for the apprehension of all sturdie Rogues, or vagabends, that shall beg, wander, or misorder themselues within his authoritie,
and for the bringing of them before a Iustice of Peace, but shall suffer any such to escape, then shall such Constable, or Officer forfaite vj. s. viij.d. for euerie such Rogue.
All Constables and other the said Officers must be attendant vpon Coroners,
for the abiuring and conueieng of such persons, as shal take the Churchyard as a Sanctuarie, for safegarde of their liues, by occasion of any Felonie by them done.
All these things heretofore rehersed, whether they concerne the preseruation of the Peace, or any other matter besides the Peace, may ought to be done and executed indifferently (as thinke) by any of the saide Officers within the precinct of his authoritie: that is to say, as well by the high Constable of the whole Hundred or Franchise, within his Hundred or franchise, as by the Constable, pety Constable, Tythingman, Borsholder, Boroehead, Headboroe, Thirdboroe, or chiefe Pledge, within his towne, parish, Tything, Boroe, or Hamlet: and that so, as none of them hath more power of office
therin than the other, although some of them haue longer limits of place tha~ the rest.
But now am come to such things as do seuerally belong to some of these Officers,
so as the others may not meddle therewith (which is the third part of my promise) and therefore will take that in hand also: and bicause the Constable of the Hundred, or franchise, is the greatest of these Officers, both in respect of his larger precinct of place, and also of the higher trust that is committed vnto him, will begin at him: who, as he is not by and by set alone, but is for some matters no further authorized than some other of the said Officers, so will first begin at those, and then come to the rest that belong onelie to himselfe.
The mony appointed to be leuied by the Churchwardens of euerie parish+eth Sonday for the reliefe of Prisoners in the Gaole,
ought (vnder the paine of fiue .) to be paied by them once euerie quarter of a yéer to the high Constables or head Officers of euery Hundred, Tything, Wapentake, towne, or parish:
and the saide high Constables, or head Officers ought (vnder the paine of
.) to paie ouer the same money so to them paid, of the next quarter Sessions of the Peace, to such person as shal be appointed by the Iustices of Peace to receiue the same.
If any person lawfully appointed by the Iustices of Peace to be Collector for the poore, shall refuse to accept it,
or accepting it, shall be negligent therein, he shal lose to the poore of that place fortie shillings, which shall be leuied by distresse, or recouerie by Action by the high Constable, or Tythingman of the place: who also, if he be negligent, or refuse so to sue within two monethes next after such default, shall lose fiue pounds.
It séemeth to me, that in these two cases next aboue, the words, high Constables, high Tythingmen, head Officers doe exclude Petie Constables, Borsholders, and such like to meddle therein: bicause none are called High, or Head, but in comparison of Lowe and Base.
Now therefore will speake of matters concerning the high Constable of
where Petie Sessions for seruants and labourers (otherwise called statute Sessions) were vsed to be kept, before the first day of the Parleament holden in the fift yéere of the reigne of our gracious Queene Elizabeth may yet still holde their said Sessions, so that nothing be done in them, repugnant to the Statute of labourers and seruants made in the same Parleament.
and of Franchises, ought to make presentment to the Iustices of Peace, and to all other Iustices thereto assigned, of the defaults of watches, and of the defaults of the Queenes highwaies not inlarged so, as no ditches, vnderwood, or bushes be within
foote on euerie side of the same, and also of such as lodge strangers in vplandish townes, for whome they will not answere.
or Wapentake, in which any abiding place to set the poore people in, shall be appointed
by the Iustices of Peace, shall once euerie moneth (vnder the paine of twentis shillings) make a view and search of all the aged, impotent, and lame persons within their authoritie, and all such as they shall finde, not being borne, nor within thrée yéers next before dwelling within that diuision (except lepreus and Bedread persons) they shall presentlie sée conueied, on horsebacke, in cart, or otherwise by their discreations, to the next Constable, and so from Constable to Constable, the directest way, till euerie of them be brought to the place where he or she was borne, or most conuersant by the space of thrée yéeres next before, there to remaine in some such abiding place, or otherwise to be prouided for.
Estreates indented ought to bée made by the Clearks of the Peace,
and by Stewards of Leetes, of all forfaitures rising in the Sessions of the Peace, or in Leetes, vppon the Statutes of highwaies: of which Estreats, one part ought to bée deliuered yéerelie within sixe wéekes after Michaelmas, to the Bailife or high Constable of the Hundred,
Lathe, or Wapentake, wherein the default was committed, and the other part to the Constable and Churchwardens of the parish in which the default was made, to the insent, that such Bailife, or chiefe Constable, may thereby leuie by distresse the same forfaitures, or the double thereof (if no distresse can be found, or if such forfaitures be not paid within twentie daies after a lawfull demand of the same by the said officer) and to the intent also that the saide Constable and Churchwardens of the parish may therby cal the said Bailife, or High Constable to account before two Iustices of the Peace (the one being of the Quorum betwéene the first day of March, and the last of Aprill yéerely for the said forfaitures, which ought by the said Churchwardens to be bestowed on the Highwaies in their parish.
And vpo~ such account, euerie such Bailife, or high Constable shall haue for his paines viii. pence of euerie pound leuied and paied by him, and may also reteine xij. pence for the fée of the Clearke of the Peace or Steward of the Leete, for euerie such Estreate by any of them deliuered, as
Next after the Constable of the Hundred, Wapentake, or Franchise, followeth the Constable of a Towne, who is somewhere called a High Constable, for that he hath there a Petie Constable vnder him, and is somtimes also termed a Head Officer, bicause in some Corporate townes Constable is part of the name of their Incorporation.
And now also bicause there be sundrie things that are by the Statute Lawes indifferently referred to him, or to the Tythingman, Borsholder, or such other inferiour officer of the place: therefore will first set downe those, and then afterward speake of the rest that are committed to him only, and to none of them.
or in any the Arts appointed by the Statute of Labourers (made in the fift yéere of our Souereigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth may depart, after the time of such reteinour expired, out of the towne or parish where he last serued, to serue in another, vnlesse he haue a Testimoniall vnder the seale of the Constable, or other such Officer, and of two other honest
housholders of the towne or parish where he last serued, according to this forme: Memorandum, that A.B. late seruant of C.D. of E. in the countie of K. husbandman, or Tailor, &c. is licensed to depart from his saide Maister, and is at his libertie to serue elsewhere, according to the statute in that case made and prouided.
In witnesse whereof, &c. dated the day, moneth, yeere, and place of the making thereof.
Which Testimoniall, the Parson, Vicar, or Curate of the parish where such Maister, Mistresse, or Dame doth dwell, ought to register, taking onelie ij.d. therefore.
And if such person be accepted into any other seruice, without shewing such Testimoniall to the Constable, or such other Officer, Curate, or Churchwarden of the place where he shall be accepted, he shall be imprisoned till he procure such a Testimoniall, which if he doe not within
daies next after the first day of his imprisonment, he shall be whipped as a Vagabond.
or corneharuest, the Constable, or such other Officer of any township, vpon request made,
and for auoiding the losse of any corne, graine, or haie, may cause all such artificers and persons (as be meet to labour) by his discretion to serue by the day, for the mowing, reaping, shearing, getting, or inning of corne, graine, or hay, according to the skill and qualitie of the person: and if any such person shall refuse so to do, then ought such Officer (vnder the paine of fortie shillings) to imprison such refuser in the Stocks, by the space of two daies and one night.
ought to be conueied (from the Iustice of Peace before whome he shall be brought) by the Constable, or such other Officer of the parish where the apprehension shall be, but onelie to the Constable, Tythingman, or other such Officer of the next Towneship, or parish, in the next Hundred, and so from one Hundred to another, by the Constable, or such other Officer of euerie such Towneship or parish which shalbe next in euery such Hundred, the direct waie, vntil they shal come to the Gaole or prison appointed for such Rogues: vnder the paine of vj. s. viij d. for euery default
or other such Officer, and the Churchwardens of euerie parish, ought yéerely vpon the Tuesday or Wednesday in Easter weeke, to call togither a number of the parishioners, and to choose two honest men of their parish, to be Surueiors of the works for amendment of the high waies within their parish leading to any market towne: and ought then also to appoint sixe daies for the amendment of those high waies before Midsommer then next folowing: and ought openly in the Church, the next Sunday after Easter, to giue knowledge of the same sixe daies.
They also ought to haue one part of the Estreates indited, and may call the Bailife or high Constable to Accompt,
concerning the forfaitures for default of amending Highwaies, as hath alreadie appéered before.
And they also or any of them, may leuie by Distresse and by sale of such Distresse, all summes of money forfaited for anye cause within the Statute of Highwaies made in the eightéenth yéere of the Queenes
Maiestie that now is (if so be that the Surueiors of High waies shall not before haue leuied and imploied the same within one yéere next after the offence committed) shall yéeld Account thereof before two Iustices of the Peace,
These things last aforesaid, doe (in mine opinion) pertaine as well to the charge of a Tythingman, Borsholder, Headboroe, Chiefe pledge, or such other inferiour Officer of a towne or parish, as they doe to the Constable of such a towne or parish,
that hath any of those other Officers there vnder him.
But some other points of charge there be, that belong to him onlie, and to none of them: as for example.
and market towne, that haue a Constable, ought also to haue common measures sealed, and also common weights sealed, at which the inhabitants may fréelye weigh.
or other merchandize, be shipped to the Staple, in any suspected place adioining to the coast of the water, then Indentures ought thereof
to be made betwéene the owner, and the Maior or Constable of that place: or otherwise such merchandize shall be forfaited.
Constables, and other head Officers within euerie Citie, Borough, towne within this Realme, where any such Officers be, ought vnder the paine of xl. s. for euerie default, once euerie moneth at the least, to make search (aswell within liberties, as without) in all places where any vnlawfull games shall be suspected to be kept, and may arrest and imprison aswell the kéepers of such places, as the haunters to the same, till they be bound, no more to kéepe haunt such places.
And if any such Head Officers, shall find or knowe, that any artificer, craftesman, husbandman, apprentise, labourer, seruant at husbandrie, iourneyman, or seruant of artificer, or that any mariner, fisherman, waterman or seruingman, doth plaie at the Tables, dice, cards, tennise, bowles, clash, coiting, logating, or any other vnlawfull game, out of Christmas time, or out of their Maisters house or presence in
the Christmas time (vnlesse it be by the licence of such Maister as hath
l. by the yéere, or aboue, and then also that plaieng be within the precinct of such Maisters house, garden, or orchard) then such head Officer may commit such offendor to warde, till he will be bound by Obligation to the Queenes vse (in such summe as to the discretion of such Officer shall be thought reasonable) that he shall not from thencefoorth vse such vnlawfull games.
that bée authorised by the Statute to make taxation of monie for the amendment of any decaied bridge in the high waie, ought to make that taxation, by the assent of the Constables, or of two of the most honest inhabitants of euerie towne or parish.
and townes, wherein no Wardens of Cowpers be, the Maiors, Shirifes, Bailifes, Constables, or other head officers there haue power to search, view, and gawge, barrels, kilderkins, firkins, and other vessels, to be made there, and to take such aduantage thereby, and in such maner,
as the Wardens of Cowpers within the Citie of London may take on euerie behalfe.
and other head Officers of any place, to which woollen hats, bonnets, or caps (being made out of this Realme shalbe brought, ought (vpon knowledge thereof to them to be giuen by the Customer of such place, or his deputie) to ioine with such Customer, or deputie, in the sale of such hats, bonnets, or caps for such prises, as by the statute are limited: vpon paine to forfaite twentie pounds for euerie time that they shalbe remisse in that sale.
In all these cases also, last before rehearsed, it séemeth that Borsholders, Tythingmen, Headboroes, and other such (being in townes and parishes, vnderneath Constables that be there) cannot meddle: bicause such Constables be (in comparison of them) called Head Officers.
it may wel appéere, that Borsholders, Tythingmen, Headboroes, Boroeheads, Thirdboroes,
and chiefe pledges, whether they be there the onelie Officers for the peace, or be vnderneth Constables, may within their Borowes, Tythings, or Hamlets, doe manie things that the others may doe: and that there are manie other points, which those other Officers may doe, and wherewith these Borsholders and the rest cannot meddle at all.
And therefore, to auoid idle repetition of matters alreadie spoken, say shortly, that it an Vnder Borsholder, Tythingman, Headboroe, Boroehead, Thirdboroe, or chiefe pledge, will sée what belongeth to him to doe, he must looke before vpon all such cases, where his power is declared to be equall (for those points) with the power, either of a High Constable of the Hundred, or a Constable of a towne or parish: for in all such things he hath to deale as well as they: but where any thing before is shewed to apperteine onlie to the High Constable of a Hundred, or onlie to the Constable, or chiefe or head Officer of a towne or parish, there such a Borsholder, Tythingman, or any of the rest, hath nothing to doe with it.
And thus, hauing opened, so shortly, and plainly, as could the duties of all these said ministers of the peace, doe shut vp this worke: desiring those that shall take any profit of this labour, to yéelde thanks to God the most liberall giuer.
FOr the more ease of euerie of these Officers, in finding out of that which belongeth to them, haue diuided this Treatise before into thrée and fortie Articles (or parts) by which ech of these Officers may readily come to all that which belongeth to his owne charge, if he will marke this Table following: for, The High Constable of the Hundred, Franchise, or Wapentake, hath to deale with al those matters that be conteined within any of these Articles, that is to say, Articles concerning
Prisoners: Poore: Petie Sessions: Watches: High waies: Poore: High waies.
The Constable of a Towne, or Parish hath his part in all such things as be expressed in any of these Articles: Articles concerning
Kéeping of the Peace: Seruing of warrants: Execution of statutes: Physicians: Purueiors: Rogues: Coroners.
Prisoners: Collectors for the Poore: Seruants or labourers: Rogues: Highwaies: Weights and measures: Merchandize: Vnlawfull games: Bridges: Vessels: Hats and Caps.
And euerie Borsholder, Tythingman, Borochead, Headboroe, Thirdboroe, and chiefe pledge, may for his Boroe, or Tything, learne his office by these Articles: Articles concerning
Kéeping of the Peace: Seruing of warrants: Execution of statutes: Physicians: Purueiors: Rogues: Coroners.
WHilest passed through som of the statutes before, concerning the Offices of Constable found them mingled with diuers duties perteining to the Churchwardens of parishes: the Surueiours of the highwaies: the Distributors of the prouision for the destruction of vermine: the Collectors and Ouerseers for the poore: the Wardens and Collectors for the houses of Correction: whereby was also mooued to adde somewhat of these Offices, the rather bicause was persuaded, that with that little more of labour, might doe a great deale more of good, seeing that thereby the plaine countrie man should (after a sort) be furnished with all maner of vnderstanding (in the temporall lawe) néedfull for the exercise of any of those offices that may lightly fall vpon him.
First therefore, will speake of the Churchwardens office, but that so farre
foorth onelie, as the common lawes and statute Lawes of the Realme doe leade me· knowing, that such other parts of that Office, as doe rest vpon the Lawes Ecclesiasticall, be from tune to time sufficiently both taught and called vpon, by those that haue the Execution of the same.
These Churchwardens of Parishes be taken (in fauour of the Church) to be for some purposes a maner of Corporation at the common law: that is to say, Persons enabled by that name, to take mooueable goods or cattels, and to sue, and be sued at the Law, concerning such goods for the vse and profite of their parish.
And therefore, a man may well in his life time giue, or by his last will beqeath mony, or other moueable things to the Churchwardens, or to the parishioners of a parish, either for the reparation of their Church, or towards the of bookes,
Communion cuppes, Linnéen clothes, or other decent ornaments or furniture for the Church.
Which maney of gift is so much fauoured in the Lawe, that it is not altogither néedfull, in such a gift, for a man to
For if a man doe buie a Bell, and doe hang it vp in the Stéeple, or doe make a Pewe, and doe set it vp in the Church, and doe neither make any worde or writing thereof, yet is this Bell,
or Pewe, by this dedicated or giuen to the Church.
Now, although Churchwardens shall haue none Action at the common lawe to recouer a legacie, or such other thing which they neuer had: yet neuerthelesse, if any such goods, or ornaments of the Church be once in their possession and custodie,
then shall they maintaine an Appeale of Robberie against him that stealeth them, or an Action of Trespasse against him that shal wrongfully take them away (though it be the Vicar, or Parson himselfe) and the damages that they shall recouer thereby, shall be to the vse and benefite of the parish, and not to their owne vse.
But if those Churchwardens (from whome the goods were so taken) shall happen to die, before any Action by them brought for the goods, yet shall the next Churchwardens haue Action for
And forsomuch as these Churchwardens be officers, put in trust for the behoofe of their parish, therefore also are they not enabled with any other power, than for the good and profite of the parish.
So that Churchwardens can neither giue awaie, nor release, at their owne pleasure, the goods of the Church.
For if the Parishioners shall finde that they doe vnprofitably waste, or mispende the goods of the Parish, then may they remoue such churchwardens, by making their choice of new:
which new Officers may (by Action of account) call to account the former Churchwardens,
and shall thereby compell them, both to giue reckoning of their doings during their office, and also to make satisfaction to the vse of the Parish for the harme that it hath receiued by their fault.
And although the vsage and custome of the Parish be, that the Churchwardens there shal continue in their Office,
by the space of one whole yéere or two yéeres, or more (as indéed som Parishes haue such customs) yet vpon such, or the like misdemeanor
found in them, may the parishioners at all times procéed to an Election of new Churchwardens, and may remooue the olde, for that otherwise they haue no meane by our Lawe to call them to their Account, but by such as shalbe put in their place.
Neuerthelesse, those former Churchwardens shal (vpon the making of such their Account haue allowance of all néedefull summes of money, or other things, which they haue expended, either vpon the reparation of the body of the Church, or for the prouision of méet and lawfull ornaments, or other furniture of the Church or Parish: bicause they are compellable (by the Ecclesiasticall Lawes) so to lay foorth the goods of the parish committed to their custodie and charge.
They shall haue allowance also (vpon such their Account of the money paied by them for reléefe of prisoners in the co~mon gaole, by vertue of the Statute
and of whatsoeuer other thing that they are by lawe chargeable to doe. This (in effect) is the power and charge that the common Law doth giue to Churchwardens: for, as touching any
estate in lands, or the profites of any lands, Churchwardens haue not to meddle at all: insomuch, that if the walles, windowes, or doores of the Church, be broken, or the trées in the Churchyarde be cut downe, or the grasse therof be eaten vp, then the Parson, or Vicar (and not the Churchwardens shall haue the Action for it:
bicause Churchwardens are not by Lawe allowed to be a Corporation for any other thing,
Now therefore will shew how their office is increased by a fewe Statute lawes, that doe concerne the same.
shal diligently and faithfully (hauing no lawful or reasonable excuse to be absent) endeuor themselues to resort to their parish Church or Chappell accustomed, or (vpon reasonable let thereof) to some vsual place where common praier and such seruice of God as is conteined in the booke of common praier shall be vsed in such time of let, vpon euery Sunday and other daies ordeined and vsed to be kept as holie daies: and then and there
to abide orderly and soberly, during the time of the common praier, preachings, or other seruice of God, there to be vsed and ministred, vpon paine of punishment by the Censures of the Church, and also vpon paine that euery person so offending shall forfait for euery such offence xij.d. to be leuied by the Churchwardens of the parish where such offence shal be done, to the vse of the poore of the same parish, of the goods, lands, and tenements of such offendor, by way of distresse.
The Constables and Churchwardens of euery parish shall yéerely vpon the Tuesday or Wednesday in Easter wéeke,
call togither a number of the parishioners, and shal then elect and choose two honest persons of the parish to be Surueiors and orderers of the works for one yeere for amendemint of the Highwaies in their parish, leading to any Market Towne: which persons shall take vpon them the execution of their said offices, vpon paine, euery of them making default to forfaite xx. s.
And the saide Constables and Churchwardens shall then also name and appoint
sixe daies for the amendement of the said highwaies before Midsummer then next following: and shall openly in the Church the next Sunday after Easter giue knowledge of the same sixe daies.
And they also ought to haue one part of the Estreates indented, and shall call the Constables to account, &c. as it doth appeere before in the
See after also in the office of the Surueiors of the High waies, for leuieng those forfaitures, by the Churchwardens, if the Surueiors shall not leuie and imploie the same within one yeere after the offence committed.
If any person within this Realme shall (without lawfull licence) eate any flesh vppon any daies now vsually obserued as fishdaies,
or shall vppon any Wednesday now newly limited to be obserued as Fishday, haue aboue one dish of flesh, for which also he shall then haue thrée seuerall dishes of Sea fish, shall forfaite thrée poundes for euery such offence, or else suffer thrée moneths imprisonment.
whose house any such offence shall be done, being priuie or knowing thereof, and not effectuallye disclosing the same to some Publike Officer hauing authoritie to punish the same, shall for euerie offence forfaite fortie shillings: the third part of all which forfaitures shall be to the vse of the Parish wherein the offence shall be, and to be leuied by the Churchwardens after any conuiction in that behalfe.
to be giuen to any person for notorious sickenesse, by the Bishop of the Dioces, or by the Parson, Vicar, or Curate of the Parish, ought to be registred (if that sickenesse shall continue aboue eight daies after such licence granted) in the church booke with the knowledge of one of the Churchwardens there: and the partie licenced shall giue iiij. d. to the Curate for the entrie thereof.
with sixe other parishioners (to be required by the Churchwardens) shall yéerly in one of the holydaies in Easter wéeke, and at euery other time when it shall be néedfull, taxe and assesse euery
person hauing the possessio~ of any lands or tythes within that parish, to pay such summes of money as they shall thinke méete, according to the quantitie of such their lande or tythes.
And if any such person doe denie to pay the same, or doe not pay the same (within fourtéene dais next after request thereof made by the Churchwardens, or one of them) then such person shall forfaite for euery time fiue shillings, which (togither with the assesed) shall he leuied by distresse of the goodes and cattels of such person, to be taken by the Churchwardens, or one of them, the same distresse to be ordered and vsed, as distresses taken for amerciaments in any Léetes.
And as well the said summes as penalties (if any of them be so leuied) shall be yéerly by the Churchwardens, or one of them, for the time being, deliuered by Billes indented to two honest and substantiall persons of the parish which shall be elected and appointed by the Churchwardens, and shall be named, The Distributors of the prouision for the destruction of noisome foule and vermine.
sixe persons, or Distributors, or any of them, shall refuse or make default in the execution of any part of this act, contrarie to the forme thereof, then such offendor shall forfait for euery default fiue pound, the one moitie to the Queene, the other to him or them (vsing tillage yéerely within the same shire) that will sue therefore in anye court of Record.
For the rest of the office of the churchwardens, concerning this matter, see afterward in the dutie of these Distributers.

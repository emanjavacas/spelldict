pleaseth it yovr grace there haue beene two that haue euer molested the church in her periods of peace the heretique and the atheist
the first in matters of veritie obducing a cloud and spreading a curtaine of ignorance and error before the eies of gods people the latter in things of pietie withdrawing the cloud and opening the vaile of maiesty and honour to euery vulgar both hand and eie
concerning the first as requiring more of the head leaue to those learned pens and selected soldiers whom god hath endowed with greater measure of vnderstanding to fight his battels
but for the second that aske more of the heart presumed with the poore widow in the gospel to cast my mite into the donaries of god to the vse of the godly
a subiect am well assured as necessarie as distastfull for these times for whether it be that gaine hath obturated mens eares or guilt hath obdurated their hearts find abroad men much recalcitrant to this doctrine yet how

needfull it is to be touched report me to christian hearts
but who am that should irritare crabrones whose impudencie notwithstanding or ignorance or importunitie for so did such vermin signifie in hyeroglophicall learning if they prooue obstreperous most humbly craue your grace to protect me if not from their buzzing yet from their stinging
whose height beeing placed in the zenith of this hemisphere albeit they cannot reach with hands of iniurie yet feare me they will not forbeare to barke at with hearts of enuie
to your grace therefore in the behalfe of all this church offer this simple treatise for whose vigilancie and indefatigablenesse as we thanke the lord so we pray him for your long continuance and happy sitting

the anatomie of ananias and sapphiraes sacriledge
epigraph acts


bvt there was a certaine man named ananias with sapphira his wife that sold a possession

and kept backe part of the price and brought a certaine portion and laid it downe at the apostles feete his wife also beeing priuie thereunto

then said peter ananias why hath satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the holy ghost and keepe backe part of the price of the possession

while it remained was it not in thy power and when it was sold was it not thine owne why hast thou conceiued this thing in thine heart thou hast not lied vnto man but to god

when ananias heard these words hee fell downe and gaue vp the ghost and great feare came vpon all them that heard these things

chap

the explication first in the logicall resolution

the white horse that went out at the opening of the first seale

whose rider had a bow and a crowne and made victorious conquests may seeme to bee that suadae medulla the power of the spirit in the lips of the apostles that so soone and suddenly wan such worlds of soules to the obedience of the gospel whose confluence and concourse was not more conspicuous for the companie then prodigious for the vnanimitie where platoes idea of perfect communitie was really performed and his excellent modell of true vnanimitie was actually established
for here indeede was cor vnum anima vna for saith luke

the multitude of beleeuers were of one heart and minde in so much as there was none that lacked for such as were possessors of lands and houses sold them and laid downe the prices at the apostles feete and distribution was made according as euery one did need
so did other so did ioses a leuite and for that cause was happily of the apostles surnamed barnabas or the sonne of consolation for comforting the hearts of the church who

as yet were but barely prouided for persecution being feared without and penurie felt within her doores
but as he and other did beautifie the religion with their deuotion so there want not that blemish the same with their deep dissimulation
therefore luke to illustrate the fact of the one opposeth ex diametro the fault of the other as chrysostome obserueth to the ende the dissimulation of ananias may giue a lustre to the sinceritie of ioses and shewe the world that there is a consolation in christ

a comfort of loue a fellowship of the spirit and bowels of mercie though profane men neither praise it nor practise it
this the occasion

now here is set downe a wicked combination of a man and his wife in a matter of dedication by themselues done to god and his church how to delude and frustrate both which counterfeit carriage the great and holy apostle doth both descrie and discouer first to their conuiction secondly to their confusion
where first we may reade the sinne and then the censure
the sinne is sacriledge that is compilation or cousenage of things now consecrated to god and holy vses
the censure is excommunication or distriction of the spiritual sword and that in the heauiest of all heauie curses
the sinne is set downe first barely by luke by way of historicall narration the censure inflicted by peter by apostolicall iurisdiction the historie is couched in the two first verses and comprise the efficients materiall and formall causes
ananias and his wife sold a possession and kept backe part of the price and

brought undefined span alphabet a certaine quillet or quidditie a thing of nothing in comparison of the maine a niggardly share whereas they had promised the whole as barnabas had done before and they made shewe to imitate

the censure followes first in reprehension secondly in castigation
the reproofe containes
an accusation

a confutation
the accusation is in the appellation of the offender ananias and enumeration of the parts of the offence which are three
the author by whose suggestion why hath sathan filled thine heart where is also touched part of the forme of the offence

the obiect against whom the sinne was committed including also the other part of the forme that thou shouldst lie to the holy ghost

the subiect wherein the matter of the sinne consisted and keep backe part of the price of the possession

the confutation followes and that is of three secret obiections answerable to the heads of the accusation but inuerting the order as the manner of scripture is to doe to the last first

obiect

a man may doe with his owne what he will but this was mine ergo
to this the apostle answereth by letting passe the maior as beeing impertinent and denying the minor with distinguishing vpon the time first for time of possession· granting it when it remained vnsold remained it not to thee namely the land secondly and for time of alienation yeelding it and when it was sold was it not in thine owne power namely the price thirdly but for time

of dedication denying it strongly by interrogation and passing it ouer by a crypsis of method as if all law and logicke all rule and reason did disavow it for thou hadst no more right to the monie now giuen then to the land now sold

obiect

as to the author he might say if it were an offence yet was it not mine but satans as your selfe auouch
to this he answers with a non sequitur though sathans by temptation yet yours also by approbation he might haue as one noteth suadendi not cogendi potentiam he might suggest hee could not enforce he was the founder the woer the father thy heart was the worker the spouse the mother why hast thou conceiued this thing in thy heart obiect

well then though a fault and in some sort my fault also yet no such great fault as needed so sharpe and publike reproofe at the worst being but to a few simple men that could challenge nothing of a free donation and might haue receiued other satisfaction
answ
yes your sinne is not so much to men who are but the assignes to whom the benefit of your donation should haue acrued as vnto god who is the donor who by such fraud is frustrated and by your dodging dishonoured not onely the father that foundeth his church in his sonne and the sonne that collecteth it by his spirit but the holy spirit that sequestreth it by his power sanctifieth it with his grace beautifieth it with his gifts combineth it with his loue preserueth it by his prouidence and honoureth it with his truth thou hast not lied vnto man but vnto god euen god the holy ghost

this is the reprehension the castigation follows when ananias found himselfe first thus deprehended in the darkenesse of his owne deceit like the fish sepia that misteth her selfe in her owne mud and reprehended for the blacknesse of his sinne by the wisedome of the spirit and peircing words of the apostle and lastly confuted in the simple labyrinth of his owne logicke it remaines that hee is confounded by the inward remorse of his couetous conscience and as at the hearing of his owne funerall sermon falls downe dead in the place by the fulmination of the fearfullest anathema anathema a temporall consternation of the bodie cut off from the grace of life and eternall malediction of the soule depriued of the life of grace an exemplarie vengeance to other a fearfull iudgement to himselfe by a sad a sudden and vnrepentant death not so much in forme of words as in the effect of deeds when ananias heard these words he fell downe and gaue vp the ghost

lastly the vse of this curse annexed what effect it should and did produce to other trepidation and feare illustrated by the extent or quantitie both of the affection and the subiect or auditors great feare came vpon all them that heard these things
and thus much for the context and analysis or logicall resolution

chap
ii
the theologicall tractation
first of his sinne in generall how great it was and what

concerning his sinne that it should be proportionate to his punishment all do not agree the most auouch that it was sacriledge none say it was lesse but some say more as namely that sinne vnto death the sinne against the holy ghost
thinke it was both
first that his sinne was sacriledge it is

too apparent to be gainesaid as am of opinion although the learned fulke vpon the rhemish notes

seemeth to denie it as take in heate of dispute
for the detaining or detracting of any thing dedicated to holy vse though dedicated but by mentall intention hath beene defined to be sacriledge by such as haue defined that sinne and so the streame of auncient and moderne diuines doth run generally that way as thus augustine

ideo cito mortuus est ananias vt paterit quam magnum peccatum esset quod oblatum est iterum retrahere ananias died suddenly to shew how hainous a sinne it is to reuoke anything that is offered or dedicated to god
chrysostome

vides quid hoc crimen imputatur eo quòd pecunias suas accepit quas consecrârat thou seest how he is charged with a crime for taking away his monies which he had consecrated or hallowed
and a little after sacrilegium enim valde graue magno contemptu plenum for sacriledge is a very grieuous sinne and full of great contempt
ambrose

dum ex co

quod promiserat partem sacrilegij simul accusatur fraudis for defaulting a moitie of that which he had promised to god he is charged with sacriledge and fraud
so the old
calvin

sacrilega fraudatio quod partem eius subducit quod sacrum esse profitebatur it was sacrilegious iugling to diminish that which he professed holy
aretius

furtum fuisset in re propria fraude retinere quod simulat publicare it had beene stealth or ordinary theft in his proper and priuate goods fraudulently to hold backe what he made show to make common ergo this was sacriledge
beza

cum totum pretium deo consecrasset post per sacrilegium partem separabat hauing vowed the whole he subtracts a part to his owne vse
so the new

now to define sacriledge historians vse the word diuersly for noting this siune to be both hainous and odious therefore they call all hainous and hatefull sinnes by the name as sorcerie murder violation of parents trucidation of princes and whatsoeuer engendreth publique detestation and slaunder

but indeed the word in proper signification hath respect to god whether by derogation of his glory or violation of his law or opposition of his truth or vsurpation of his titles or prophanation of his temples or vilification of his seruice or diminution of his reuenewes and things dedicated to his honour
the etymologists of both tongues deriue it from stealing

as undefined span alphabet and sacrilegus doe import

therefore
the heathen defined it from robbing of the heathen temples
the christian ciuilians from christian churches
our common lawyers set out the force of the word by the fellonious intent rather then the subdolous manner whether of secret lurching or open purloyning
diuines both schoole and reformed quicquid fit ad irreverentiam sacrae rei as

th aquinas zanchius

violatio sacrorum vrsinus

ablatio rei sacrae derogation of holinesse abuse or lurching things deputed to holy vses
therefore innocentius more by way of allusion then true notation saies that sacrilegium is sacriledium any such abuse whereby god or his religion is preiudiced and depraued

whosoeuer therefore taketh away or alienateth to other persons or vses goods or things chattels our lawyers call them of the church that haue been giuen to maintaine gods church and seruice the canonists say doth incurre ipso facto crimen laesae maiestatis that is sacriledge or treason to the highest maiesty and as high treason to the king is the highest degree of a subiects enormitie so in proportion is sacriledge to god but in ananias this is ioyned with a higher whereby his sinne is out of measure sinfull

this seemes to me also to be very plaine first by the literall oneration of peter in the third verse lying to the holy ghost where the verie nomination of that person of the trinitie who guided and gouerned as present and president this whole businesse doth insinuate no lesse
for who doth work the miracles

but the holy ghost who doth reueale the donors most intimate intentions but the holy ghost who doth kill with the word of his mouth

the incorrigible sinner but the holy ghost who doth so powerfully congregate so many thousands by

the mouth of but the holy ghost who doth segregate this goat from the blessed flocke for infecting further but the holy ghost therefore the holy ghost particularly is and peremptorily affirmes himselfe to be aimed at in this businesse of holinesse therefore the sinne against that person is that sinne the sinne of the holy ghost
and hereunto the holy fathers also accord as hesychius

quoted by doct
fulke vpon the place on the rhemish testament dominus dicit omne hominibus dimittitur blasphemia in spiritum sanctum non dimittetur hoc petrus ipso opere ostendit quia ananias sapphyra spiritui sancto sunt ait eos quare
the lord saith euery sinne shall be forgiuen vnto men but blasphemie against the holy ghost shal not be forgiuen this did peter really declare because ananias and sapphire lied to the holy ghost he saith vnto them why hath sathan blinded or filled thine heart and thus he
and doct
fulke himselfe

is of the same opinion as it were denying ananias sinne to be sacriledge because the seminaries said it and avouching it to be this sinne

the same also doth aretius affirme alleadging another interpretation of those words why hast thou lied to the holy ghost mentiens spiritum sanctum fingens se habere spiritum sanctum belying the holy ghost

that is saying that he had the holy ghost but reiecting it and cleauing to that construction contra spiritum sanctum against the holy ghost that it was the sinne of the holy ghost
and that which puts it out of question calvin

in saying ananias sinne was sacriledge prooues it thus that we now speake of for as it hath been obserued by learnedst writers that sinne is no one single sinne but aggregativum

quid a collection of many great sinnes
an aduised sinfulnes
a resolute wilfulnesse
an obstinate maliciousnesse
an vninersail wickednes or generall apostasie all which or the most with some addition calvin obserues in this sinne and they are not hard to be found all have for thomas saith there

are sixe species or spices of it
against god
in forbidding
in remitting sinne against both which this sinner doth offend
against his iustice forbidding by presumption
against his mercie pardoning by desperation

against himselfe
dolor de commisso
propositum de noli committendo griefe for that which is past and purpose for that which is to come against both these also is this sinne
obstinate and malitious persisting in sinne
finall impenitencie and purpose not to leaue sinne

also vnto other
amor boni
agnitio veri the loue of all that is good and the embracing of all that is true in stead whereof this sinne hath
impugnationem veritatis agnitae
invidentiam supernae
wilfull resisting of knowne truth
enuious hindering the heauenly grace all which are not obscure in ananias
as for example
he knewe that god did knowe

his doubling yet is not afraid saith calvin to practise the same

whereas peter did preach the hainousnes of his sinne vnto him hee had a heart that could not repent and therfore vnfaithfull to lay hold on the mercy of christ

he was so farre from repenting that he grew harder purposing to die and dying in his purpose of non repentance

he loued his goods more then goodnesse or good men

resolued that no man should bee saued by his helpe
these things in briefe may serue to shewe that the sinne of ananias was both sacriledge and more which yet shall be more fully declared in an other

place where wee shall more particularly vnfold the seuerall properties of his sinne
so much in generall of his sinne

chap
iii
in particular

reprehension of the man by compellation or personall rowsing

although that these delinquents had seene and heard enough in the sermons of the apostles and exercises of the congregation to haue instructed them in the power and iustice of god and haue called them away from halting betweene couetousnesse and godlinesse yet such is the foolishnesse of sinne and blindnesse of sinners till god commeth home close vnto them that they will neuer beleeue that god either sees or dislikes them and therefore the holy spirit takes such a course in this place as is

fittest to rowze vp a sinner sitting in his chaire and sleeping his nappe vpon his couch or cushion of securitie as his conscience may be soonest conuinced and his state easiest recouered and that is by singling him out particularly by his name and nature that hee cannot shift the notice that is taken of him
it is small question but hee knewe his owne name which in him as in all other in those times was significant
humbled
afflicted
answered by god so saith aretius doth ananias import

his ambitious desire of credit beeing loath to be at the cost was to be humbled

his euill heart and worse eye enuying the apostles any maintenance or the conuerts any sustenance was to be afflicted

his corrupt and cankred manners was to receiue such answer from god as they most deserued
this because he himselfe would not remember his loue to monie hauing raced his owne name like an other cervinus out of his minde the holy ghost doth rubbe his memorie of reducing all these notions vnto his remembrance by striking this string and sounding that name to his vnderstanding
the officers of the inquisition when they suspect a party and cannot probably conuince his concealing they will suddenly pronounce his surmised name and obserue how hee is affected at that sound by which stratageme they haue come to the cognizance of notable disguisers which they might haue despaired any other way to haue wonne
which course god seemeth to take with men not that any can so halt before him as to goe vnknowne but because by so particular a

course he would bring them both to knowe themselues and also to know that he doth knowe them· so did he to the protoplast

adam where art thou and his eldest sonne caine

where is thy brother abel and the mother of ismael

hagar saraes maide what doest thou here

the reason hereof dauid seemeth to touch

sinners doe flatter themselues in their wickednes till their abhominable sinne be found out and euer since adam was driuen to his shifts in paradise he will finde some to couer his nakednesse and with that siely hide his head in a crowde saying in populo magno non agnoscar the throng shall hide me and is there knowledge in the most highest therefore doth god go very particularly to worke as in the lot of

ionas and ionathan

to minde the offender for example there is

a sinne committed for which the army is ouerthrowne and no man will confesse the fact it must be found that god may be reconciled the campe freed and the partie punished the ordinary course as in those cases must be by way of lot where the hand of god is immediate index iudex
the lots are cast into the lap and the tribe of iudah is taken here achan vnquiet before begins to startle now yet hope of impunitie hardens him so as he will confesse nothing a second draught of the familie of zarites frees the rest of iudah as the lotterie of iudah had secured the other tribes now the man beginnes to change countenance and purposes to saue all labour and confesse of himselfe but because he lingers the third draught finds the house of zabdi

then he falls to quake and tremble so that all men that saw him might reade his fault in his face and while he is astonied between passion and purpose he heares himselfe to bee named when loe hee falls downe and sinkes vnder his sorrow and if it were to begin againe he would stay the search and yeeld himselfe prisoner
why did he not that sooner if we would iudge our selues

we should not be iudged nowe when we are iudged we are chastised of the lord that wee should not be condemned with the world
and thus doth peter in this place not onely to point at but to paint out a double dealer who had he any sparke of grace had preuented iudgement and cut off by timely confession so fearefull a condemnation
but nothing would serue to wring his vnhappy purchase out of his fingers so hunger of bootie and hope of impunitie betray most men who were we well assured we should one day be called to personall account we would neuer for so miserable pleasance buy at so deere a rate so certen repentance
sinnes are debts and debts are as sonnes who growe so well that they will crie after vs and owne vs by our name if we stay them not within or stoppe not their mouth without
as the staffe and the ring did challenge

iuda so we shall be bewrayed by the same token if in time we take not vp the matter with a lambe or a kidde of the fold by the hand of our friend the good adullamite and so much of the apostrophe or compellation

chap
iv
reprehension of the matter or enumeration of the parts of the offence which are
the author
obiect and
subiect
although in the
chapter laid downe his sinne in some generalitie by way of explication yet now order leadeth vs by the hand of the text to vnfold the branches somewhat more particularly by way of demonstration not as hunting out the hainousnesse thereof in any one arme or diuision thereof but shewing the forme and materialls in the whole ioyntly together
the first part therefore is the author and prime moouer which is here by the apostle said to be satan

now although the prince of darkenesse doth worke in all the children of disobedience and the deuill hath his hand in euery sinne yet it is not vsuall to name or mention him but in some very notorious and greatly outragious as in that of iudas

that the deuill entred into him and of elymas

that he was the child of the deuill and of antichrist

that his comming is with the effectuall working of the deuill and in the ecclesiasticall historie when the horrible heretike cerinthus

greeted saint iohn the apostle and euangelist with non nosti nos knowe you not mee receiued this answer noui te primogenitum diaboli yes know you to be the deuills eldest sonne
so that as the poets in inextricable exigencies do bring down

iupiter vpon the stage undefined span alphabet by a deuise or engine so doth god in matters that passe the ordinarie pitch bring in sathan to shew the transcendencie of the sault

we are then to know for the fountaine of sinne that there are cogitationes immissae satans iaculations and cogitationes ascendentes humane ebullitions this of ananias is mixt of both as appeares in the next words where repeating the same matter he alters the phrase saying why hast thou conceiued this thing in thy heart so that both satan did fill his heart and his heart conceiued it satan by inticing moouing perswading he by consenting yeelding obeying satan by casting in his fierie darts of temptation he by blowing these coales of destruction
by the enuy of the deuill saith syracides

sinne entred into the world yet out of the heart saith our sauiour

arise euill thoughts murders adulteries thefts

wherefore as satan entred into iudas

non tam vt tentaret quàm vt possideret not so much to tempt him as to possesse him non vt alienum sed vt proprium not as a stranger but as his peculiar nec tam vt possideret quàm vt transformaret not so much to possesse him as transforme him whereupon our sauiour

said haue not chosen you twelue and one is a deuill so he tempted possessed transformed ananias with an extraordinarie temptation a souraigne domination an vniuersall transmutation so that as iudas was a traytor before he did betray as our sauiour insinuates quod

facis in the present tense fac citò for beeing so wholly set vpon it with head and heart

and hand that had his heads beene as many as cerberus or the whore of babylon and his hands as many as briareus or any king of whom it is said an niscis multas regibus esse manus he would haue set them all on worke so full he was vp to the top non facit peccatum sed est peccatum

it was too small a predication to say he did sinne for he was conuerted into sinne hee was nothing but sinne
and yet this was but one halfe of his sinne that he left no place for god no place for goodnesse satan had taken vp all the roomes in his heart as interpreters do obserue
and all this is but his stampe of one side whose man he was and whom hee entertained
come to the other side whom he will not say kept out but draue out his sinne against the holy ghost the second part of the sinne

although lying be sometime set for dissembling in the holy booke as where dauid saith

his enemies shall lie vnto him speaking both of the type himselfe or his sonne and the messias to note the hypocrisie and of his vanquished subiects and againe of the like

they should haue beene found liers vnto him that is they should humble themselues with false obedience and forged submission yet as we haue noted cap

very learned expositors besides the aduantage of the letter haue taken it for that irremissible blafphemie that is directed against the third person in trinitie not of ignorance or of infirmity as to the sonne and the father but of malice to the fountaine and author of holines which as the schoolemen say

colorem

non habet excusationis quod quantum in se est directè impugnativum est medici remedij per quod fit remissio peccati it hath no colour of excuse because as much as in it is it doth directly oppose both the physitian and the physicke whereby remission is wrought
bellarmine

directè resistit repudiat gratiam dei it plainely resisteth and refuseth gods mercy such is the sinne

now if we looke when or wherein this sinne by him was committed we finde nothing but this fact for which he was tainted or touched then this verie sinne quatenus he promised such goods to the author of holinesse to be a helpe and meanes to propagate holinesse as it concerned the person cui was blasphemie beeing frustrated and falsified in the effect as it considered the thing in quo the detension of that which was so deuoted was sacriledge which is the third branch of his sinne now comming in order to be touched or the circa quod

wherein we must now no more set our eie vpon the partie to whom the origination and procuration of holinesse doth pertaine the last thing which we considered but the materialls of holinesse or the things sanctified and separate for holy seruice themselues of the fellonious diminishing whereof ananiis here charged as we saw before and it is seuerally set downe in the next words by a disiunctiue coniunction thus and keep backe part of the price of the possession

wherein beside his impious that ficta oblatione deum ecclesiam fallere vouit

saith calvin by a false shew of a bountifull heart hee went about to gull both god and his church we obserue his fowle prophanation of a faire constitution for it was now a voluntarie graunt or a customarie practise receiued for law in that litle commonwealth that such as had should improoue their loue to the highest linke when he like ionas worme doth blast the honour of god the vse of goods his owne deuotion and others sustentation with one cast of hypocrisie

will not mention his foolish ambition that for a small aire of humane applause he could be content to forfeit his reward in heauen nor his paganish incredulitie that thought god either would not in so many coufluences of proselytes or could not in so great incumbrances of opposites maintaine his church and therefore thought to haue more hold of his hand then he had of his tongue
these be the parts of his sinne seuerally laid open in themselues and yet in such reciprocall aspect and position one to another that they touch and take essence and efficacie one from another for the fulnesse of satan argues his totall and finall apostacie from god and his sinne against the holy ghost confirmes his sacriledge to the holy church and lastly his enuying and spoyling the holy church prooueth his compleate deuillishnesse
of which particulars before we collect the totall summe let vs gather such vses of these points as lie scattered in our way that both our path may be the smoother and our prouision for the rest of our passage the better

first then we here obserue the truth of those words of salomon

that follie is bound vp in the heart of the child that is that we are all both naturally and habitually addicted to all kind of sinnes as hauing satan to our father and an irreligious and corrupt fountain for our mother
and this folly is no other but in which sense those two words are equipollent beeing termini convertibiles onely the difference is this the one hath relation to the head as principium laesum the other to the hand as organum corruptum and therefore we are no lesse indangered by ill thoughts then preiudiced by ill deeds
men commonly thinke that thought is free and so it is in some sence in ciuilitie because the magistrate takes no notice of them vnlesse manifested with outward proofes not in diuinitie to thinke what we list in regard of god for he is scrutator

cordium a trier of the hearts and reines and euill thoughts eat out the heart of religion therefore salomon

counsels not to curse the king so much as in thought and peter

bids simon magus pray that his thought might be forgiuen him for the very thoughts

of the wicked are abomination to the lord the transgression of the euill angels was but in thought and oftenne lawes there is one to reform the cogitations

secondly abyssus abyssum vocat saith the prophet one depth calleth another which is no lesse true of the inundation of sinne then of the seas for by custome of sinne and delighting in a tenor of disguising we bring our selues to that passe that all the balme in gilead will not cure vs too much dallying

with sinne brings to the deadly sinne
iulian did banish grace so long donec omnino gratia spoliabitur when we beginne with impietie and goe on with hypocrisie we commonly end with apostasie
sampson played so long with dalila that in the end his locks were shauen in good earnest
the losse of greatest

peices comes by the least breach vnespied or vnrepaired
ninus victories were not onely gainefull for the present but vsefull for the future sequentium etiam causae the meanes of more so is it in sinne it hath not onely lapsum but reatum besides the illnesse of the fall it leaues a pronenesse to fall further therfore rightly and obseruantly called by the apostle deceitfulnesse of sinne for besides the harme that is in view there is more danger in that which is concealed

sinnes are sores first but vitious humours then they growe to angrie tumours and after they turne to burning vlcers within a while to eating cankers and last of all to incurable tortors not onely morbus but mors animae as bernard saith
therefore let vs not

drawe sinne with cords of vanitie nor transgression with
cables or were first threds then cords last cables so is the twisting of sinne
against knowledge
against conscience
against the strongest not motions onely but reclamations also of gods spirit
malice against any men is hainous against holy men dangerous against god and holines damnable
let that alwaies be our praier

keepe vs lord from presumptuous sinnes so shall we be innocent from much offence from this offence
and

so much of the enumeration of the seuerall braunches of his sinne

chap

the aggrauation of the sinne of sacriledge

now then to summe vp all that hath been said for as much as satan is here mentioned in this matter and that as no idle spectator but a busie actor and so busie as not to send any small troopes or lend little helpe but to replenish with the fulnesse of his iniquitie the whole heart of this peccant partie it is giuen vs to vnderstand that sacriledge is no small defection or transgression but an entire desertion of gods spirit and solide interest of satan in the child of perdition for as de quo vis ligno non fit mercurius euery logge will not make a mercuriall so de quo vis luto non fit sacrilegus euery mould will not serue for sacriledge
we may well set downe that this is a foule a fearefull a fundamentall sinne not razing the skin of christs scalpe like the iewes crowne of thornes but renting the sides of christianitie like the souldiers speare as we reade in the gospell
for which cause the canonists were wont to allot

seauen yeares penance vnto it as ivo burchardus gratian and the rest agree where so many daies sufficed other sinnes

whereas this sinne is so gloriously attended not onely with a deuill but so great a deuill as the sinne

that is irremissible the sinne vnto death the blasphemie of the holy ghost wee haue a faire aime to descrie the sinfulnesse of sacriledge by the old rule that teacheth noscitur exsocio qui non dignoscitur exse

a mans gate his countenance his companie will soone shew what he is

now here hee goes hand in hand with a sinne and if they should contest for prioritie hath here the precedence as carrying the denomination therefore of force we must confesse that it is very

hainous
in paul he marcheth in equipage with a high sinne the sinne of idolatrie and of idolatry

the iewes haue a prouerbe idololatra totam legem abnegat the idolater disanuls the whole lawe the like then must sacriledge beeing of the same size and latitude renounce the whole law not onely

as iames saith he that offends in one commaundement is guiltie of all but because all the second table depends vpon the first and all the commaundements vpon the foremost and therefore resemble hippocrates twins laugh and weepe liue and die stand and fall with equall simpathie

for first the diuine plato in those excellent books concerning lawes hauing in the former touched the violation of sacred persons comming in the tenth to speake in excellent method of sacred things auerreth expressely thus much of the sacrileger that hee must needs perswade himselfe one of these three things
that there is no god at all
or if there be yet that he is nothing so iust and terrible to his oppugners as the world is made beleeue
or at the least

that hee is very facile and flexible to be reappeased when by sacrilegers he is abused euery of which do raze the foundation of all religion

so that these men aime at no lower leuell then god himselfe and are therefore those presumptuous gyants that by antiquitie were said to mutinie against heauen because as they know no goodnesse so they would acknowledge no god and beeing enforced to that necessitie enuie him all seruice and seruants
and therefore it is well obserued of an heathen writer soli sacrilegi pugnant contra deum it is no

other then your sacrileger that wars with god and make rampiers against his maiestie
thus then plato hath soundly concluded all sacrilegers to be verie atheists for albeit they do not totidem verbis in direct

termes denie there is a god with dauids foole and those abiects of the forlorne hope yet doe they the same indirectly and by necessarie consequence when they deifie a false or idolize the true god which is by denying his essentiall attributes and diuine properties
as
of holinesse with such as do thinke him like themselues that is a god that delighteth

in wickednesse·
of iustice saying shall haue peace though walke in the stubbornenesse of my owne heart

of power like the aramites that said he was a god of the

hills and not of the vallies

of prouidence saying he doth neither good nor euill

but zanchius saith that sacriledge is species irreligionis a spice of atheisme iumping with aquinas that saith it is oppositum religioni crossing religion and augustine that saith it is directè contra

deum opposite to god in point blanke whose reasons are most reasonable because it can proceed from nothing but open contempt of holinesse and plaine impietie for els why doe men lay theeuish fingers vpon things consecrated to religion but because they care not for religion or whereto tends the spoile of holy things but to the ouerthrowe of holinesse for men knowe this god cannot be serued without men nor men bee maintained without meanes therefore the substracting such meanes is the disappointing such seruice therefore zanchius reduceth sacriledge to the second commaundement where gods seruice is established and prouided

because it is here set out in his owne colours it is not amisse to take a tast of the fulsomenesse of it
the donations of former times that were giuen to god

were called anathemata either for their sequestration from profane vse or suspension on the walls and pillars of holy temples
now what the latines called anathemata from the greeke the hebrewes called cherem
for their consecration
for their execration the one in their vse and end the other in their nature and effect of all which the lord to moses gaue

this caueat let none of the cursed thing cleaue to thine hand because in that case the spoyle in warre or any such thing as the lord reserued to himselfe did alwaies

so prooue as is expressed in iosuah keepe your selues from the cursed thing least it make you accursed and

trouble you as fel out to achan in the valley of achor or of trouble

therefore the censers of the rebellious leuites

beeing once consecrated when they perished were

commaunded to bee preserued not for any or prophane vses but to make a couering of the altar
but

to deuoure such holy vtensils or donation salomon pronounceth to be a curse or snare or destruction as seuerall translations do read it that is to appropriate them to priuate vses

the like metaphor doth ieremie vse to shew their nature israel was as a hallowed thing vnto the lord all that touch him shall offend euill shall come to them saith the lord nothing the vengeance on their enemies to bee no lesse then sacrilegers
paul compared it as wee

saw with idolatry which destroyeth the whole lawe and samuel with idolatrie and witchcraft as the

contrary obedience with the holiest sacrifice god

himselfe with other theft where the circumstances of the person augment the gradation will any people robbe their idols which are their gods salomon with the

hainousest theft among men he that stealeth from his father and mother and saies it is no sinne the same is a compinion of the destroyer

wherefore to conclude
if in ordinarie theft he that steales to satisfie his soule when he is hungry if he be taken shall restore seuen fold or giue all the substance of his house

if the flying booke of gods

vengeance shall enter into the house of the theefe which booke was cubites long and
broad that is a terrible curse though but to his substance

if he that steals from his father shall be destroyed

if idolaters and witches must not liue
or to gather the argument more narrow
if that man that

sinnes against another is to be iudged of the iudge and make so large satisfaction what rule of proportion will serue sufficiently for our computation for a man that shal sinne against the lord who shallplead for him what shall be done vnto him we may bee sure that if caine bee reuenged seuen times and lamec
how many millions how many myriads of millions shall he be reuenged that sinnes against god that tooke vengeance of caine and lamec both for finiti ad nulla est proportio
and so much shall serue for the aggrauation of this sinne

chap
vi
the censure or excommunication
hitherto we haue seene his sinne which we may truely pronounce to haue been a sinne of sins now followes his punishment and that well proportionate a curse of curses anathema euen maranatha the most high the most heauie the most horrible of all degrees of ecclesiasticall censure for that it was an ecclesiasticall censure the whole series or order of the causes doe euince

the efficients both principall and instrumentall
the forme of spirituall or ecclesiasticall iurisdiction
the matter execration or extirpation
the ende that other may feare

now then for our better vnderstanding both of his sinne and of his suffering the learned drusius

doth teach vs that among the iewes where this fell

out there were three sorts or seuerall degrees of church censure apparant enough in both testaments

called niddui of nadah a word that signifies expellere or elongare to expell or driue far away this we haue in esay heare yee the word of the lord all yee that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you and cast you out for my names sake said let the lord bee glorified that was the forme as we see in achans story

but he will appeare to your glorie and they shall be ashamed
and this is that which in the newe testament is called casting out of the synagogue as the pharisies serued the blind man whom christ had healed hauing

made a canon that whosoeuer should confesse iesus to be christ should be excommunicate or cast out of the church


the second was cherem of the roote that signifies occidere or excidere to kill or cut off this we finde

in moses where god speaking of the cursed nations whom his people were to exterminate and possesse their places saies thus as the vulgar translation doth well deliuer it anathematizando anathematizabis eos the english if not so significantly yet as effectually thou shalt vtterly destroy or roote them out
and this paul had respect vnto when he said would to god

they were cut off that trouble you and where bee would haue the incestuous corinthian committed to sathan


the last was that which the iewes call sammatha or sammatizatio of shamam that signifies desolare ad stuporem vastare atta tu let such a curse fall vpon thee as is vltima execratio or maledictio

the vttermost execration or accursednesse
or as some thinke of shem for hashem which is the name of god and atha venit or to come to expresse the euerlasting curse the comming of the lord which paul elswhere alludeth to
this word we finde in ieremie

his lamentations sion is laid desolate
which lamentable estate of the church in that booke is fully

deplored ier

this paul as said before did expresse in that imprecation or denuntiation of a most zealous heart who so loues not that is hateth and persecuteth the lord iesus let him be anathema maranatha euerlastingly accursed till the comming of the lord to iudgement and a day after
and these were the church censures

now are we to examine for as much as it is vndeniable but this of ananias is such which of all these three it is that is here inflicted
first of a certaine not the first for that was but a depriuation of the spirituall estate for a time concerning the companie and comforts of the church with condition annexed of reconciliation and repentance now this here was corporall as well as spirituall and eternall with a barre against repentance therefore not that

secondly nor the second which as some thinke either was not corporall such as the ciuill sword could inflict but a permission or emancipation onelie to the power and regiment of satan who hath his kingdom out of the church to who such sinners were deliuered ouer to the end that the flesh that is

the old man might be mortified and the new renewed or as augustine speaketh vt moriatur error viuat homo

that the sinne might be killed and the sinner saued
or if a corporall also as we must confesse of achan the cananites and other vpon whom that curse was corporally executed on earth vpon their bodies which was pronounced and enacted in heauen yet but corporall hauing time and meanes of grace offered for repentance
therefore it must be the last partaking of both but exceeding both so far as extreame doth goe beyond partiall and eternall sutmounts temporall

a temporall and extemporall cutting off the bodie from the grace of life and a spirituall and eternall cutting off the soule from the life of grace the sorest seuerest extreamest vengeance that can be afflicted on a man in this world forsaking and forsaken of god
a sudden and vnrepentant dissolution of bodie and soule a present and immediate manumission from god and grace to the place and torments of the damned a iust guerdon for him that gaue himselfe ouer to the full sway of the prince of death to mocke that god of heauen defeat his spouse on earth blaspheme the spirit of sanctification
tremble to thinke that any child of man specially a child of the church an auditor of the apostles a professor of christ a benefactor of the church no apparant professed enemy or atheist or persecutor or apostata should be liable to so execrable a sentence to be excommunicated anathematized sammatized for grudging a few pence or pownds to god and his church
but leauing secret iudgements vnto god wee must needs acknowledge that god seeth not as man seeth for that which

mans eie could not perceiue the eies of god that peirce the heart did see in his carriage a us and obstinate a presumptuous and desperate hypocriticall persecutor and enuious apostata the essentiall marks of a certaine reprobate and forlorne sinner
if any yet beside the exigence of the fault will needes require more reason for so great seueritie for their further satisfaction may lift off their eies from looking vpon peter as if he either of his owne

power or his priuate humour had slaine the partie and remember it was the holy spirit that in defect of temporall magistracie not yet christian did moderate the whole matter whose wisedome so far as we either may or can looke into might commend these reasons
the church was to be kept in awe and feare of god
as in a newe established polity or gouernement as there must bee examples of reward for the righteous so also of punishments for delinquents
that vnder the colour of religion and new conuersion one should not defeat or defraud another
it was requisite that the authoritie of the church should be wrought among them without and they prepared by such exemplarie iustice to like and loue her gouernement
these and such like which calvin and expositors doe alleadge may serue to stoppe any curious mouth that will haue god to giue account of his iudgements

here then are we taught first of all of the wonderfull effect and supereminent power of the word of god in the mouth of his holy apostles and faithfull ministers not onely and alwaies seruing in cases

of edification but sometimes also for destruction albeit that very destruction also of his enemies tends to the edification of his children
and these are those undefined span alphabet works of power mentioned by

the apostle and undefined span alphabet the sword of the

spirit to hack and hewe the vngodly in peices and undefined span alphabet weapons not carnall but mightie in operation and as dauid cherev pipijoth two mouthed

or edged sword with this did moses strike corah and his complices god himselfe nadab and abihu er and onan iezabel and athalia iosua achan and them of canaan elizeus the
children and this did peter drawe out here against ananias and sapphira
whereby we see the church censures are no bruta fulmina little childrens beadles and boltles artilleries but tearing and roaring cannons nor left to the swaying of peter alone much lesse to that man of rome to brandish not so much against sinnes as soueraignes but left in trust to all the true ministers of the gospel

neither is it without neede that there should be such rods and swords in the church of god for such as are so audaciously insolent bad by selfe impietie but much worse by our impunitie
to the end therfore that the wicked may be corrected the exorbitant the timerous affrighted the sound secured and the iudgements of god that hang ouer our heads and the land auerted let moses and aaron the cherubios of the lord that are set to keepe the way to the forbidden tree waue their fierie blade against all blasphemous disturbers pertinacious resisters

impious atheists perfidious heretikes wayward schismatikes erroneous idolaters and incroaching sacrilegers

it is true we haue a sword and that doth not iust in the scabbard but as petrus de aliaco did sometime complaine in the council of constance it is subiect to much abuses vulgaritie partialitie which make it almost a wooden dagger gladius saith he qui in primitiua ecclesia veneranda raritate erat formidabilis iam propter abusum contrarium contemptibilis factus est the ecclesiasticall sword which in the primitiue church was seldome vsed and greatly reuerenced is now become by daily distriction of small account and little esteeme

the like complaint doth scotus make so as wee may truely say with the poet

te genitor cum fulminatorques nequicquam horremus coeci{que in nubibus ignes terrificant animos inania murmura miscent

now concerning the vsurped proprietie which the bishop of rome doth claime to himselfe as peters successor that is the sole temporall and spirituall monarch whose yron must beare downe all swords whose keies must open all locks whose ledde must blunt all steele and crosier put downe all scepters albeit between these two propositions peter for sacriledge stroke ananias dead and the present paulus
may excommunicate king iames of great brittaine for non conformitie there be many gulfes to fill and casmaes to make vp leaue to be further confuted by the learned pens that at this time fight the lords

battels against that man of sinne
sure am of one thing this is not peters petra rocke of saluation but neroes tarpeius the of destruction nor eloquium dei but laqueus diaboli nor ignis spiritus but

ignis fatuus

come to some other point more neere our matter and obserue the wisedome and omniscience of the mightie spirit discerning the hearts and peircing the reines of the most reserued hypocrites for albeit here are many things of more then ordinarie practise the immediate gubernation of the church in generall at this time and this action in particular the immediate reuelation of this part in proper and the immediate emancipation of the party to his place of perdition yet this no way hinders the information of our knowledge concerning his nature and power that all things are naked to his eyes and that there

is no creature that is not manifest in his sight and confirmes those doctrines of the prophets the lord

search the heart and try the reines and of the apostles thou that knowest the hearts of all men shewe whome thou

hast chosen
such a god is it that we serue that can discerne himselfe and disclose to other the secretest malefactors ionas in the shrowds nathaniel vnder the figtree ieroboams wife vnder her maske the assyrians plotting in his priuie chamber the iugling of gehezi the blanching of iehoram the bloodinesse of hazael the blending of dauid the idolizing of the iewes
for which the heathen in their hieroglyphicks disciphered iupiter by an eie and an eagle to insinuate that such a nature beseemed the

highest maiestie as was not deceiueable by any obscuritie

the consideration of which point may serue to disrobe vs of all adams and bereaue vs of all hope of impunitie in our secretest villanies and most inveloped treacheries
erasmus brings in a paire of amorous pigeons looking for some very retired roome where they might renew their lewd acquaintance but neuer could so be couered in any corner that the eies of god should not descrie them
therefore in that description of him in the vision

his eies are said to be as a flaming fire that is eies for obseruing sire for reuenging according to the poet

undefined span alphabet
this one perswasion if well concocted would strangle our wicked proiects much better then those simple supposalls of the heathen of

cato or scipioes what we doe

lastly obserue we in this censure the exact retribution and geometricall proportion which god

obserueth in his iudgements
those saith gregorie nyssene are the purest stones and finest chrystals that do most truely represent the faces of the inspectors yeelding backe to merrie visages merrie reflexions but to sad and sowre lookes the like againe such are gods doings which represent to vs our iust deseruings so that it is easie to reade our owne deeds in his very doomes
as for example

the old world was plagued with inundations of waters because of their great inundations of sinnes

the fiue cities were consumed with sulphurous flames of fire against nature because they boiled with sulphurous

flames of lust against nature
pharaoh that

had been as a staffe of protection to the people of god so soone as he turned serpent to hisse and sting his benefactors to death is showne himselfe in a reall embleme by the staffe in the hand of moses and his vnnaturall subiects had their waters turned into blood for defiling their riuers with the innocent blood of the israelites children and in the end were drowned in the red sea for drowning others children in their nilus

saul no sooner reiected the word of the lord in the spoyle of the amalakites but he heard himselfe reiected from being king and as the sword of that agag whom he so spared had made many women childlesse so was his mother also by the hand of samuel made childles herselfe among other women
adonibesec that had cut off the thumbs and toes of

kings and set them to picke crumbs vnder his table was by ioshua serued with that same sawce in the end himselfe

this sea of examples hath no bottome
dauids adulterie was repaied him by his sonne ioabs blood ahabs field diues almes and a number more

heraclius the emperour following incestuous lust

had such distension in that part of nature that he could not let his vrine but in his owne face
brunechildis a wicked queen of france that ioyed in nothing but the discord of her children was in the end taken after she had made away
princes and infinite other and was torne in peices with wilde horses

boleslaus king of cracow who put staniflaus his bishop to a cruell death for his honest admonitions and carued his flesh among his dogges being driuen out of his kingdom and wandring in hungarie was torne in peices of his owne dogges
but to insist in

this verie sinne leo emperour of constantinople taking a rich coronet out of a church set with diamonds and other verie rich stones and setting it on his own head had instantly his head so pearled with boiles and crowned with carbuncles that for extremitie of torment he instantly died

there was one addo archbishop of mentz that hauing a number of verie poore people in his countrie that craued his reliefe he caused them all to be collected into a barn vnder a colour of almes so set it on fire and when with their extreame yelling and howling they had with their noise peirced vnto him where he sate in his pallace he vsed this sarcasme while they were dying that he heard the mice cry for this bloodie paganisme god sent such armies of rats and mice vpon him that he built a tower in the midst of the rhine to saue himselfe from them but all would not serue for mightie shoals of them tooke the water and destroied him most miserably where he trusted for securitie

so to say no more ananias meddles with the execrable thing as achan had done before and is thereby himselfe made execrable and this is that retaliation

which moses mentioneth an eie for an eie and a tooth for a tooth
end this point with a speach of augustine fitting both ananias and vs dum altenum

rapis diabolo raperis dum alienum detines diabolo detineris retines aurum perdis animam iniustum lucrum sed iustum damnum lucrum in arca sed damnum in conscientia pereat ergo lucrum per quod fit animae tuae damnum while thou preiest vpon another the deuill preieth vpon thee and while thou withholdest that which pertaineth to another he hold vpon thee hee takes thy soule while thou takest away thy neighbours siluer thy lucre is vniust but thy losse is most iust the lucre is in thy cofer but thy losse in thy conscience defie therefore such gaine of this world whereby thou loosest thy soule in the other

and so come more particularly to note the seueritie of god against sacriledge for in the extermination

of these two we are plainely giuen to vnderstand what guerdon they are euer to expect that violate the sacred reuenues of god a feareful expectation of extreamest vengeance both of bodie and soule a consideration able to strike vs through with horrour and amazement if our hearts were not harder then the neather
if any shall doubt of that say and mocke at my words as speaking for our owne particular and pleading for our owne profit let him turne backe a few leaues and consider the true reasons hereof both in the second chapter where in generall we did explicate his sin and in the fourth chap where in particular we handled the members and branches of his sacriledge

wherefore proceede and say that there was neuer any that imbarked themselues in this

impietie but he ran a course of endles infamie and vtmost extreamitie

to beginne with the verie beginning caine the generall of this damned crewe if his world of miserie was not solie for this yet dare avouch it was from this that he liued a proiected runnagate and died a reiected reprobate of whom the fathers obserue this that hee offended if not in the quantitie of his oblation yet in the qualitie thereof declaring by the coursnesse of that hee offered the abiectnes of his esteeme of him to whom he offered the refuse of his crop and linings of his corne
which impietie of his vnto his creator was first punished with vnnaturall inhumanitie to his brother and that againe with obdurate impenitencie vnto god till altogether they brewed him a loathsome extraction of a hatefull life and a desperate procuration of a cursed death

the fact of achan is so obseruantly set downe that may well passe it in the catalogue of these catiues and see some other

the sinne of hophni and phineas consisteth of triplicities
it was sacriledge
heynous sacriledge
blasphemous sacriledge
sacriledge for not contented with the priests portions they vsurped also vpon the lords part which was to be burnt to him in sacrifice

heynous for the sinne of the young men is said to haue bin great before the lord

blasphemous they were not onely extortioners but abominable miscreants causing

the sacrifices of the lord to be abhorred
such was their sinne
their punishment also had triplicities
fearfull comminations there came a man of god to expostulate with elie and to denunciate his cruel iudgement

dismall exterminations the arke taken of the vncircumcised the sonnes slaine in battel in their priestly pontificals the father breaks his necke at the news the wife dies in abortiue deliuerance the priesthood remooued to an other familie and their issue depriued both of honour and honest meanes of life

odious commemorations in after ages to deterre both priests and people from their predecessors prophanenesse
god alludes to them goe to my place at silo and see what did to it for the wickednesse

of my people israel and because you haue done the same workes will doe to this house as did to silo and cast you out of my sight as cast them
note how extirpation

still is the reward of sacriledge
passe ouer saul as

did achan the same sinne the deuoted thing the like cutting off if not of life present yet of gods fauour which is true life by vtter dereliction and finall extirpation of life and linage when god sawe time

nebuchadnezar because when the lord was angry with his owne people and had made him the rod of his wrath he went beyond his commission defiling himselfe with sacred compilations was metamorphosed for a time as sedulius hath described him

nam quod ab humana vecors pietate recessit agrestes pecorum consors fuit ille per herbas aulica depasto mutans conuiuia faeno

pronus ab amne bibit septena{que tempora lustrans

omnibus hirsutus syluis montibus errans

with which punishment god seemed contented for his time but when god came againe in visitation and found his carowzing and profaning those verie bowles and sacred vtensils in the midst of his courtiers and concubines and breaking iests vpon cyrus and his army that then had surrounded his citie with a strait siege in all securitie and confidence and scoffing among at the feeblenesse of the iewes god that could not keepe that much and massie plate he saw his fate pourtraied before his face vpon the wall how that he was numbred ballanced and reiected which that instant was accomplished his city surprised his life bereaued his empire that had been aboue a thousand yeeres intailed to his auncestors in a moment translated not to another family onely but to an other countrie
now let them that intaile their sacriledge vnto their posteritie as they doe their substance remarkablely consider but this example and see if such prescription may preuaile any more with god then to hasten and accelerate their fathers iudgements on them and theirs for euer

hasten to iudas who least hee should lack any damned sinne was also a sacrileger for saith the gospel he was a theefe and kept the bagge which saint augustine doth thus illustrate iudas fur sacrilegus non qualiscun{que fur sed fur loculorum sed dominicorum loculorum sed diuinorum iudas was a sacrilegious theefe no common theefe tell you but a theefe that stole

monie nor common monie but his masters monie euen gods monie
well then did he improoue it he bought a halter to hang himselfe withall now he

was accursed that hanged on a tree for first in token of fearefull malediction such an one seemed reiected of both elements both resting places both receptacles heauen and earth secondly he burst in sunder in the midst as if his impure spirit was not deighned to be let out at the doore that other mens do because hee had kissed with those lippes his masters mouth
lastly hee went to his owne place as if sacrilegious persons had a peculiar in hell exempted from the common pit where according to their transcendent impieties they should receiue transcendent penalties
what antiochus did and suffered

in this kinde presuming to rush into the holy temple of all the world and taking away the holy vessels with polluted hands plucking down the holy donatiues that had been dedicated by other kings to the augmentation of the honour of that place and carying thence the sacred treasure
talents we may read in the sacred volume but god smote him with

an incurable and invisible plague convulsions in his bellie imposthumations in his bowels till hee concluded a hatefull life with an abhorred death

the ecclesiasticall storie mentioneth iulian vncle and steward to the apostata with felix his companion like impurest spaniels pissing against the communion table and giuing the bastinado to the minister that did reprooue them and scorning at christ that the sonne of marie should be serued in

siluer plate and carrying the church treasure into the emperours exchequer with a number more of contemptuous prophanations at the last were thus rewarded the one had his mouth conuerted into a iakes that way avoiding the superfluities of nature the other the same way evaporating his soule together with all his blood

might here alleadge cesar the dictator of whom the poet thus in a true epithite

tristi spoliauit templaruina and marcus crassus who going to the parthian warre first at rome robbed the sacred treasurie and for that cause of his owne tribunes was omnibus diris deuotus cursed with bell booke and candle as the papists call it
then

taking ierusalem in his way tooke out of the holy temple
talents at one time beside a great beame of gold waighing
pound which eliazarus the treasurer vpon crassus oath to redeme the rest deliuered vnto him
in that voyage he was occisione occisus hee and his army slaine euery mothers sonne and by that losse his country fell into most miserable slauery

arnulfus successor to carolus crassus in the westerne empire at the beginning was verie fortunate but once comming to enioy peace and falling to rob and rifle the churches his former felicitie did vtterly abandon him and god punished his greedie hunger with the lowzy euill of which in great despaire within a short time he ended his life

might annex hereunto along of the heathen indignities both of the grecians as euemerus

messenius hippo diagoras sosius epicurus and dionysius and latines as scipio crassus fulvius flaccus plemmenius pyrrhus bremus and other that dishallowed their owne dieties and came to great miseries for although they were but verie deuils or meere idols vsurping the honours of the true god and therefore may be said to be but worthily serued hauing neither merit to deserue nor might to reuenge those grosse indignities yet say not it was they that inflicted those executions vpon their dishonourers but our god as lactantius hath noted

not because they abused his corriuals and those that were not gods for illumined princes haue vsed them farre worse but partly for contemning the things which themselues in erroneous iudgement did esteeme for gods and partly for profaning those well intended donations which in intention of deuourer minds were meant to the true god and so becomming first impious robbers and then scurrilous deriders which were not sufferable of those gods which themselues professed and the good things which other had hallowed
and this doth mightily confute the audacious pillages of our prophane people for if they were so reuenged that wronged the false gods how much sorer punishment doe we deserue that worshipping the true yet practise so high contempt so contrarie to the principles of our true religion

examples in this kinde are infinite but reserue the rest for another place where we shall be occasioned

to see further of this matter these for the present shall suffice to set forth the horrour of this crime and the heauinesse of the curses that god for the most part vseth to inflict vpon those people that lay vnhallowed hands vpon his houses or such chattels as are sacred to holy seruice

plato and those vertuous sages the first founders of all philosophy where euer they obserued either weakenes or wickednes in other men were wont to call themselues home to priuate scrutinie and say num ego sum talis am such christians then whose learning and philosophie is much more high and happie and requireth more heart then head more doing then knowing must much more call themselues to account whether as their bookes are better so their hearts are cleaner then other men

now for as much as all scripture beeing diuinely inspired is profitable for doctrine and reproofe for correction and instruction in righteousnesse it is necessarie as we haue laid downe the doctrine that we now proceede to the disclosing of errour that we may encounter such offenders as are eminently faultie that way
the first and cheise whereof are they of the

church of rome the verie heads whereof the popes themselues haue done most harme to the church of god first by taking and making away much or most of that which the deuotion of christians had bequeathed to god then set on their champions meane their chaplaines to mainetaine with reason that which they had done without reason

thus haue the heires and successors of peter as they call themselues made hauocke of the patrimonie of peter like young striplings newly come to their lands make good penniworths of that they neuer purchast and then their friers like hungrie parasites must reckon vp their discommodities of tythes as if it were the best husbandry to haue nothing
and this hath beene perpetrated manie waies will reckon but foure
lauish profusions
lewd incorporations
heathenish alienations
sacrilegious compilations
it would aske much time and wast much paper to prosecute all these points as they doe deserue will touch but the cheife heads and make my assertion good


for their sumptuous prodigalitie and immodest and immoderate abuse of church goods all stories are full and they that saw day at a little hole haue said more then enough which yet was nothing

to the ende the spring might neuer be drie that fed their prodigalitie they deuised the gulfe of incorporations and cesternes of additions driuing away the oxen that laboured and eating vp the while their fodder by keeping the fattest both tithes and glebe in their owne hands and staruing vp the poore and impouerishing the churches

as for their compilations where shall begin or where shall make an ende boniface the

perswading vs backe againe to the babylonian bondage not knowing god wot what they desire not a saul but a sisera with nine hundred chariots of iron to bruise and crush both bodie and soule in sunder


lastly the appropriating the tithes and church reuennews to vpstart orders of superstitious or more truely sacrilegious hypocrites vntill all was taken away from the true owners and a miserable pittance left to such as performed diuine seruice hardly able to hold life and soule together as if all religion had beene wearie of the church and taken vp her lodging

in a cloister as my learned and worthie master hath shewed in his view of both lawes most learnedly

for at what time that learning was almost cleane extinguished partly by the inundation of barbarous colonies who plucked downe churches faster then euer their fathers built them partly by the distraction of vpstart heresies amazing the eies of most men with the flourish of formall hypocrisie then came friar benedict the founder of regulars with his discontented deuotion like a new saint lately dropt out of heauen enuying himselfe and his followers not onely the delights of life but the necessaries of meate drinke apparell proprietie of any thing and the world with the heards of hornets praemonstratensis cluniacenses templaria~s hospitallers cystertians ioannites and the rest
so that all the world especially popes and princes were wholly rauished with the wonderment of their singularitie

and vied each with other who should most demerit their deuotions some enriching them with lands other enfranchizing them with priuiledges all zealing them to the vttermost of their power

among many other ill aduised prerogatiues there were two superlatiues very pernicious to the church of god

the appropriation of presentatiue benefices

the exemptions of abbey lands from paying tythes will but touch the first
when that hedge of appropriating was once by these wild boars broke downe then all the beasts of the forrest ranne thorough and made it wider
then charles martell father to king pepin of fraunce vnder colour to end the barbarous wars wressed all the tithes into his hands of that country protesting to restore them againe to the owners at the end of those warres but perfidiously brake his oath and diuided that booty amongst his that had serued him in

war whereupon there was deuised a tale that eucherius sawe in a vision martellus soule in hell and his graue being opened nothing was found but a monstrous serpent in roome of his bodie for he had depriued eucherius of his bishoprick of amiens before and also this was but onely to the end that pepin should restore the tithes againe which his father had taken away
but martellus learned that lesson of the popes themselues and they when themselues had done it de facto made their friers maintaine it de iure as first alexander of hales and aquinas his scholler the first that maintained that tythes were de iure ecclesiastico not diuino which popish conceit hath

been by diuers learnedly confuted as ridlie carlton downham

another reason of alienations for then were mens wits set on worke to deuise colours was the stiffenes of some vanquished countries as freezeland by carolus mag which could neuer be brought to pay the conquerour any tribute being free people but as for tithes because other christians paid them they would not much refuse

another cause alleaged by the same author was this that the pope and bishops mistrusting that princes would not otherwise defend their rights and reuennews were content to share with them the endowments of the church vnder colour of a fee or pencion choosing of the two rather an inconuenience then a mischeife who thereupon passed them away vnto their seruitours

and that this is true appeares by an oration of fredericke
in an emperiall diet to this effect

as to you my lords of the clergie the pope and you thinke much that lay men should hold any tithes or any thing that hath bin giuen to the church not remembring that in your neede you haue beene beholding to our armes in regard of which pious seruices we were requited againe with such things as these you hauing enough beside thus the emperour

others as the bishops of bauaria gaue all they had of church liuing and vessel to the people of hungarie to redeeme their liues and liberties for necessitie had no law

among other in england william the conquerour

vpon his victorie ouer harald appropriated
parish churches to the abbey of battaile which he built in memorie of the same where he had fought and william rufus
parishes of the new forest to the church of sarum and many other many like matters

and all this we may thanke the pope for who in this countrie alone as cambden hath obserued

of
parishes impropriated
that is almost the one halfe so that they need not charge our religion with that scurrilous prouerbe that pater noster built vp churches but our father puld them downe againe
for
it was no protestants that did alienate at all
no protestants that did procure the suppression of religious houses in the time of henry
but the proud cardinall himselfe
not protestants only that inhabite those houses at this day lastly not protestants that haue defended this fact in their writings to the world and therfore we may retort their latin with their owne learning pater noster aue marie haue been the rankest theeues in christendome

from these comes that distinction to some of ours de iure diuino humano that tythes partake of all the three of moses lawes
morall for a competencie ceremoniall for a mysterie iudaical for that pollicie decepti taking errour vp first vpon credit and after retaling it out to their petty chapmen

now then let vs a little consider this popish argument whereupon they haue grounded all this fact

of alienation whether it will endure the test or no

thus then both hales and aquinas haue reasoned

the first as the irrefragable the second as the angelicall whatsoeuer is not of diuine right but positiue by the church that is no sacriledge to alter or to alienate but tithes are not of diuine right but meerely of the church ergo


concerning the maior our learned hooker and manie other haue answeared thus the obligation wherewith the church of christ hath now bound herselfe by vow and consecration to pay tithes hauing many ages since dedicated them vnto god as a free will offring makes them so firme that it is not in the power of anie now to retract them or vnhallow them againe ergo the maior is mainly false


but to the minor it hath bin shewed that stand vpon the same ground that the sabbath doth being both in their number before the law and by moses onely repeated as many other things that were commaunded before they were prescribed
the moralitie or naturalitie of which was this that god out of all the fruits of the earth and cattel fit for mans vse should haue a tenth first as an acknowledgement of his vniuersall gouernement secondly for the contentment of his seruitours and attendants
the ceremonie or leuiticallitie fauelle verbo to be annexed to the priests and ministers during the standing of the tabernacle but alterable and altered from the iewish synagogue to the christian seruice
ob
but what euidence out of the new testament what footing in the apostolical writings ans
first

it needed no directer reestablishment and expresser naming then the sabbath therefore idle to aske it
then if it did need yeeld we so much reuerence vnto

the fathers that as they came neerer those prime and purest times so they saw more in their illumined learning then wee of dimmer sight and abortiue births


then augustine hath grounded tithes vpon that of our sauiour giue to caesar that which is caesars and to god that which is gods

which foundations for tithes if yet they shal seem not sufficient direct doubt whether such questionists will not yet doubt whether snow be white

but it is oft required why did not christ or his apostles name tithes and put the matter out of controuersie

let me first retort this argument as he did who when his aduersarie had said si satis est negare quis erit nocens replied si satis est accusare quis erit innocens but will shew why

first verie many matters that touch the foundation passe vnmentioned but not vnmeant the consubstantialitie of the sonne which the arrians did oppose particular faith which the papists pedobaptisme which the anabaptists and the sabbath which the antisabbatarians do obiect are not named of which it is heresie to doubt or deny therfore the reason is rotten to say they are not named therfore are not
secondly the synagogue was yet standing wherto by diuine prescriptions tithes were tied which though by the death of christ she receiued her deaths wound yet then was not dead when dead not presently buried but with reuerence and honour as the fathers say to be put into the graue so that till after her funerals there was no paying of legacies
thirdly the state of the new church was such as yet had neither peace nor prince so that this was no time to put in her claime but to expect till god should stirre her vp some foster fathers to order her right

fourthly and lastly for feare of scandall for as christ did forbeare a time to tell of his passion and at his death haue many other things to say vnto

you quae non potestis portare modò which you are not able to beare as now so did the apostles somewhile

conceale the point of the resurrection till the world was better acquainted with their doctrine
the like reason was of this least they might be thought as out of couetousnesse to prouide for themselues which modestie as it was in them commendable so it hath beene in vs preiudiciall the world seruing their own turn vpon our ingenuitie thinking we need nothing because we say nothing
and this may be sufficient for the silence of the new scriptures

what a cloud of witnesses both of the fathers councels heathen schoolemen late writers all writers carlton and other haue collected omit to touch least should actum agere or put my sicle in others haruest
will adde a few reasons that ioyned to their authorities may make it plaine after haue named the writers that are direct in this point

purchas of the turks and alarbes in affrica beside zenophon festus
and now to the reasons


to the ende that neither the giuer may brag nor the receiuer blush saith one that is the people should not vpbraid the minister with their bountie nor the minister bee ashamed to take his dutie therefore in old time they were to doe both in the temple therefore where tithes are not paid in kind the minister must sooth his masters or hee shall be sure to sigh for his means
so· philo and thephylact


the apostle commands and the world expecteth that the minister bee giuen to hospitalitie although pauls undefined span alphabet differs much from that keeping good houses which men expect of their minister which cannot be done by them that liue vpon a drie stipend and therefore tithes in kind are the most conuenient for the minister

tithes of all other kind of maintenance as our men are enforced to confesse that thinke they are but of humane constitution are the most naturall conuenient wise safe indifferent of all other therefore rightest way to maintaine the minister except we will say that god hath not prouided so meetely for those that preach the gospel as might be done


the first intendments of appointing tithes in all the iudgements of reuerent antiquitie by god to the old priesthood was to serue for an acknowledgement of his vniuersall power and right of the creatures graunted to their comfort
in which regard the learned calvin calls tythes proprium dei ius regium vectigal his peculiar right and regall tribute now the equitie of this remaines in the church no lesse then in the synagogue ergo


the ministers as they are in their callings the meanes of gods blessing subordinate to christ and types of his dealing to all the people so it is equall they haue equal share in the mercies and iudgments of god that they may both wayes sympathize with their people and serue their turne with their sensible praiers which is not done in a set stipend neither singing at the haruest nor weeping in times of dearth neither winning nor loosing how euer the world goeth


and lastly for the parishioners owne particular he cannot haue so comfortable a fruition of the creatures of god nor satisfie his conscience any way so soundly as by sacrificing a portion of his corne and increase vnto his god and communicating with his minister in all his goods
these take it may serue in this matter to prooue that tithes are due
meddle not exprofesso with that question my purpose is onely to shew that these things beeing holy whether by diuine ordination or humane constitution they should be inuiolable undefined span alphabet and should not haue been prostituted by the vnholy fathers

as they haue been
in which case can say no

other but that the deuill hath done like anytus one of the
tyrants that vsurped vpon the state at athens who finding socrates to stand in his way and hinder his conclusions deuised this meanes to be rid of him he hires the poet aristophanes to traduce the good man openly vpon the stage both to worke him that way some open disgrace and to sound the peoples liking of his worse intreating
the matter sorted so well to the tyrants minde that the poet for gaine and the people for game gaue way to the cup of hemlocke and socrates death

the enemie of our saluation doth beare the like splene to the ministers of the gospel thorough whose sides he seekes to wound and worke out true religion as men that indeed do marre his markets
the pope in the deuils pageant hath acted the poet to scandalize their profession by withdrawing their sustentation perswading the world that high pouertie is the way to high perfection and that a freeze gowne is habit enough for holy professors wherein wonder so holy a father doth not goe before or at least accompany vs in the way to holinesse and to possesse nothing the onely way to happinesse
therefore let them that haue any portion of gods spirit any sparke of grace any conscience of any care of stop their eares at this syren of sinne the charmes of profit remember but whose brat it is out of what scullerie it came and let them if they can if they dare approoue it

mark but how he hath in all times wrought vpon

this aduantage see whether he be not indeed of that woluish kind that first gaue rome sucke
obserue what he hath done through christendome by that he hath done by a few countries

peter rubeus at one time carried more monie out of the land then he left behind him martin when there was no more monie to be had tooke the verie horses out of the stables and it was prooued in a parliament that in the space of

answeared alexander the great scoure the aegean but you the ocean robbe a poore marchant or two but you make purchase of all the world so are other offenders in this kinde to their holines by which meanes he hath been the most bloodie persecutor that euer infested the church
for as it was said of dioclesian that he was no body to iulian for dioclesian did but tollere presbyteros but iulian sustulit presbyterium for the hand of the one was but against the professors but the other aimed at the profession taking away their saleries not medling with their safeties so that it was hard for christianity when they had no meanes left to teach and instruct the commers on which while it was had sanguis martyrum was semen christianoru the blood of martyres caused more christians
but of the pope enough and so much of the first sort of offenders in sacriledge

chap

against puritans cauillations at the meanes and matters sacred to gods seruice

come next to encounter another enemie of this doctrine cleane opposite to the papists vpon the other hand the puritan or separatist who are according

to their own definition refined protestants but to others gospellers out of their wits men drunken with their owne wine but with difference some more soberly besotted other more frantickely intoxicated

these misliked the maintenance of ministers by tithes as either papall or at least iudaicall but your stipends and contributions vnder the nature of pure almes that is iust for their tooth and wish them the cold reuersion of a cast for their labour
and no maruell for haue knowne some that haue thriued better and haue been feathered warmer vpon brethrens beneuolence being able to purchase lands let out monie to vse by rayling at the state barking against bishops and lying by the heeles in humour then many of their betters could euer doe vpon ordinarie prouisions or extraordinarie promotions
no maruell then they mislike the maintenance their way is better and before they misliked the church meanes they fell out of loue with the church it selfe the edifices ornaments ceremonies sacraments and whatsoeuer is not purum putum

these men say are sacrilegers for first they haue defiled our holy sacraries with their bedlam rhetoricke more fowly then euer they were with babylonish reliques tearming them temples of baal sties of antichrist cages of vncleane birds nay some haue commenced to such a degree of holy frenzie that they haue abhorred the very tongue wherein superstition hath talked as the language of the beast

then happily true when themselues do speake it
but leaue the persons and come to the point onely adding thus much as sampsons foxes were sundred

in the head but combined by the taile so the puritan and papist though their deuises differ their ends are one to subuert religion not professedly as doe the turkes yet by consequence and necessarie

inference most subtily
for as a learned gentleman hath lately written tithes haue been gods ancient demeane and nobler part of his inheritance founded primarily on the law of nature as that principle which teacheth to honour god we beeing in iustice bountie and gratuitie bound to acknowledge his bountie and soueraigntie but glebe land and houses howsoeuer now vsed in the nature of moueables are his fixed inheritance and seates of his mansion not so auncient yet now as proper giuen by deuout men grounded on the warrant of the leuiticall cities as it were a holy portion of for his ministers to dwell on

for vrbanus the sixt bishop of rome in anno
did first alter that communion of the primitiue

church that we read of in the acts who thought it expedient in those purest times for the perpetuall releife of the church not to sell the lands as they did in the apostles times as this fact of anantas sheweth but to keep them themselues because of the casualtie in pecuniarie contributions

and although abbey lands were giuen to vses yet both ciuilians canonists agree that long custome may prescribe in this case though

the beginning had been erroneous
and as we shall see elsewhere in donations to superstitious vses their super may bee mended but their stitious continued
as for abbey lands wish king henry
had not taken away the subiect of the question there is an other reason and question of them
but bishops lands were giuen vpon the first planting of the churches and if such temporalties of bishops and those which they called matrices ecclesiae much more tithes of gods owne institution or at the least giuen by the common consent of the christian world
all which endowments not we but the auncient fathers as

augustine cyprian chrysostom and the rest call patrimonium christi dotem sponsae christi sacram possessionem and praedia sancta

therefore let vs not correct magnificat and in presumptuous noueltie condemne and contemne all antiquitie
the word church or as our northren brittan calls it kyrck is but the corruption of undefined span alphabet to say the lords house which so long as the world was enflamed with the sacred fire of deuotion euery hand and heart desired to sanctifie it selfe to adorne and endow
but now since that was quenched and the sacred fire of rapine and sacriledge hath bin kindled men leaue to be zealous and learne to be sacrilegious becomming execrable by touching execrables

as for those lights of gods church whose learning we loue and names reuerence speak of calvin the rest whose authoritie is vrged against vs who for the prophanation fell out with the consecration

of these things like the athenian that came to aristides

to haue him write aristides name to banish him by the law of ostracisme yet it was not for any crime that either had committed but that for want of meanes and leisure from other imployments they were no better acquainted with the parties yet calvin misliked of tythes onely because they were obtruded iure not if they had been maintained ministeriali iure being well assured that reuerent man would be little pleased were hee liuing to heare his name opposed against the church that spent all his time and meanes in the behalfe of the church no more then he was with his zealous auditor that so extolled his sermons that if paul and calvin were to preach in one houre hee would leaue paul to heare caluin

for you wish you better aduised least god obserue by whom he is impeached your meaning may bee good but hast of your way hath your good intent and precipitancie in iudging hath forestalled your iudgement
for beseech you look backe into your preposterous courses and tell mee what manner of propositions these be tythes prelacies churches demeanes dignities are all antichristian the markes of the beast the garments of the whoore the sties of the deuill
lentardus
yeeres since made himselfe away in verie deepe desperation hauing taught that these things were idle and superfluous and many among you hauing been drawne away from the mother church after your whistles and oaten pipes finding hollownesse in your holinesse

haue done little better whereby many of your doctors haue been murderers of gods people and if not violatores inuaders your selues of gods inheritance yet ye haue been traditores betrayers of it to other and traytors to your master
for as in the trade of pursing there are setters and there are actors so it cannot be denied that if you did not commit the robberies your selues yet you plotted the matches and were partakers of the purchase

for who were they that egged on the herodians to beg our reuenewes and set on the souldiers to cast a chance for christs coat againe were they not some men in your coates that put vp bills and petitions to the parliament house to plucke downe churches to erect chappels to ruine many to reare one who were they that would haue made the world beleeue that bishops were antichristian callings and elders were the worthy gouernours that so not in euerie diocesse but in euery parish for a bishop you might erect a superintendent in name a pope in truth who was it that called the vultures to the spoyle the beasts vnto the prey with an edomites voice crying downe with them downe with them euen to the ground and a moabites tongue vp moab to the spoyle by which meanes both the canaanite is still in the land and the edomite hath deuoured all and all the cost bestowed on gods house is counted poperie and all the meanes that commeth not of almes is held tyrannie so that shortly we shall not be so holy as horses for they may be stabled in churches but wee shall not haue our ceremonies so well as in stables

but either in houels or vnder hedges the ministers hauing no more respect then grooms ostlers and the land no religion at all or so many as there are churches by meanes of euery new fanglednes

but what saith peter they who through couetousnesse make marchandize of the word of god their iudgement lingreth not and their damnation sleepeth not and our sauiour who so breakes the least of these commandements and teach men so to doe shal be called the least in the kingdome of heauen
and so much of the second sort

against vsurpations of holy demeanes with answer to their cauils

now come to who haue inuested themselues with tithes and church possessions some vnder colour of pious offices most without colour making them or taking them for things of meere appropriation like the frosen serpent so long harboured by the farmers fire till it had recouered life and then driuing his kind host out of his owne house
many of whose if they were well suruaied would bee found as womens accoustrements which is mundus indeed a world of trinkets but in that world the woman is minimapars sui so if euery bird had her owne feather and euery church her true tythe many of them would not haue the tythe of that they hold
such is the age wherein wee liue wherein nothing is accounted ill that can be gained the names of sinnes for the most

part as this of sacriledge containing more horror then the sins themselues as could instance in many
the sinne of vsurie that was of old so odious to god and man the vsuall theame of childrens declamations is now growne so well reconciled that no trade is more compendious warrantable vniuersall as if the venemous teeth were either fallen out with age or the vicious qualitie were so well corrected that all borrowers were inriched by it
but as one hath well said if the teeth are rebated for biting yet the gummes are hard in nipping so that it may be truely said of this as is spoken of the great turke the grasse wil neuer grow more where the grand seniors horse hath set his foote sieldome hath any state recouered that hath beene beholden vnto the vsurer yet call a demure professor by the name of vsurer though nouerint vniuersi all the world doth know it he will haue an action against you
now what is the reason of this but that he cannot endure to heare what he can be content to be the word containes some kinde of malignitie the monie hath none but like the which the emperour vespasian raised of his subiects vrine bonusest odor lucri ex re qualibet
might in like manner goe through the whole cyclopadie of sinne theeuing whoring swearing drinking and stabbing the same is the case of sacriledge the word is harsh the name infamous but the thing of a better aspect and the profit of good acceptance

in which regard manie of our great magnificos haue acted vs hercules furens who comming into venus

temple and there finding a golden adonis put that in his pocket with this pretie quip at tu nihil sacries your mastership is no deitie so whatsoeuer these men could finger in church or churchyard so long as it is neither saint nor shrine they hold for good purchase and haue been content to pocket manie such wrongs

yet the king of ammon shaued but halfe the beards of dauids embassadours for they might be too long and clipped but halfe their cloathes they might be too heauie but our shauers because they would bee sure to leaue no superfluous excrement haue taken away also the necessarie tegument so that in some sense we may though with our shame be chalenged by the papists that pater noster built vp churches but our father hath pluckt them downe againe

our deuout predecessors out of their ignorance did but abuse the materials of holinesse but our moderne demure professors out of our much learning haue quite taken them away
many ioyned in the worke of the reformation without true meaning to reformation more studying for gold then seruing of god and more thirsting for the goods of the church then any good to the church so that we may write of our reformators as a frenchman did of the last ciuil broiles of their pacificators

vulcanum aut folles aut ars ignota fefellit undefined span alphabet dum vult cudere cudit undefined span alphabet

all sat not well with vulcan sure his hammer or his head

reformers he did meane to make but hath deformers bred

for as august
said of some heretiques to establish their owne deuises misinterpreting the scriptures de medicamentis sibi vulnera faciunt make themselues sores of the verie salues we may truely say to haue falne out in this case that the medicine hath prooued worse then was the maladie the one failing but in the manner but we in the verie matter as is touched elsewhere
therefore as foolish and iladuised

people flying the inuasion of theeues or wild beasts fall into or places so while these vndertakers had their eie another way flying from superstition haue ingulfed themselues in irreligion either or at least true religion between them both
for whereas the first donors shewed humanity in the efficient impelling or moouing cause our goodly correctors haue failed in the finall for where men of more deuotion then instruction tooke superstition for religion which was the minor these men of more greedinesse then godlinesse haue taken destruction for edification which is the maior and so the last errour hath been worse then the first
wherein they seeme little to haue differed from the souldiers that cast a chance for christs coat sauing that those suffered christ to haue his life in it these haue not only parted his garments among them while he is aliue but so much as in them lies pushed at his life to possesse them securely embezeling the maintenance that should propagate his kingdome

but it hath been much and oft obiected that the ecclesiasticall liuings were fowly abused in former times and therefore it was thought good by the state they should be suppressed
graunt the abuse but what is abuse become a warrant for abolishment what logick is this or what law for poore churchmen the philosopher would denie though wine is abused that the vine should bee rooted out the like would the scholler doe for books the statesmen for armes the for scepters the diuines for scriptures
all which things if they may haue leaue to stand and to rectifie their abuse shall the church yet forfeit all if her reuenewes shall bee abused

but say that abbeyes and monasteries were abused and let it not be the fault so much of the men as of the matters themselues what haue our cathedral and rurall churches deserued admit that babylon must goe downe but why must bethelem beare her company may not as truely complaine herein as sometime athanasius did esto peccauerit athanasius at quid alij episcopi fecerunt aut quem arsenium occiderunt suppose that athanasius indeede were guiltie yet what haue other bishops done haue other bishops killed arsenius also so though abbies had deserued their doome what can be pretended against bishopricks deanries dignities cathedrals and colledges and poore countrie parsonages all are not tainted with the same imputations yet all haue beene exposed to the same maledictions

which had they been spared and gods houses

not so inuaded the wils of the dead had bin better fulfilled the infanterie of learning otherwise prouided the honour of god more carefully furthered their dying consciences better comforted and their owne successions and estates more firmely established
now desolation is written vpon many of their doores and extirpation hath seazed on their families while zim and iim daunce in their parlors ochim and ostraches scritch in their pallaces the fathers for the most part dying either comfortlesse or childlesse the sonnes liuing either gracelesse or landlesse the fathers sustaining the infamie of robbers the sonnes induring the miserie of beggars both fathers sonnes like ionas whale sicke in their states and stomacks vntill they had regorged the fat morsells which their hungry stomacks had too hastily swallowed
nay tell me if your selues haue not obserued that many of such demeanes haue prooued like seianus horse that neuer had owner but either he brake his necke or blessed him with some other misfortune
avery remarkeable iudgement of god to infuse a malignitie into the verie lands that no man should thriue that holds them no man should escape some egregious mischiefe that hath them
will say nothing of the suppressors themselues of whom a very great man of this kingdome hath written

that eadem temporis periodo it hath been fatall to some mightie monarchs at the same terme of time to haue their successors exterminate that inuaded the holy possessions

de malè quaesitis non gaudet tertius haeres

there was a farre better president showne vnto the world some
yeers since against such kind of

alienations by a statute made by edward
by disposing the goods of the templars who for their great impietie of their disordered order was then extinguished to the of iohn in ierusalem with this prouiso ne in pios vsus erogata contra donatorum voluntatem in alios vsus to say that the lands so giuen to pious vses should not against the donors intension be distracted and turned to other prophane purposes
which equall dealing might also in this case haue been practised if men had equally propounded to themselues their aime the glorie of god and not their owne gaine

but there are many things slanderously deuised and iniuriously enforced against vs to legittimate their owne sacrilegious dealing and iustifie our deserued suffering their high deserts our great vnworthinesse the disproportion of the things themselues and the incongruity in other countries

of all which in generall may say as sometime

hierome did ingemui fateor minus nobis inesse voluntatis ad propugnandam veritatem quàm inest illis inuidentiae ad inculcandum mendacium it grieued me confesse to see that we haue lesse will to auerre our true propositions then our enemies haue malice to enforce their false conclusions


first therefore as to their deserts let me say as alexander did to silence ephestion contending against craterus at quantae opes aut quod tuum facinus si quis

tibi demat alexandrum tuum and pray sir what may your mightie meanes or merits be if wee except your soueraignes fauour to be cloathed in scarlet and fare deliciously euery day is cause inough to ery heu quanta patimur oh our paines oh our seruices but supposing that the seruices were as bigge as their ambitions can faine them and as many as their parasites could straine them yet not like the merits of zopyrus to his master that to win him babylon did endure the ampulation of his eares and mutilation of his members but though they had wonne their king another monarchie yet must they stil fall short of the clergie and howsoeuer yet not to be rewarded out of the church but the exchequer

but alas that men cannot raise the walls of their owne worthinesse but vpon the rubbish of others ruines
we enuie not their honours nor seeke to supplant their fortunes let them despise vs as supercisiously as they please yet when they haue done our calling shall be both honourable with god and noble in it selfe and meritorious to the world howsoeuer our persons shall bee esteemed both for birth breeding not inferiour to many of our maligners
but to omit these titles not ours why should not pallas and apollo haue as faire charters to invest their clients with earnests of honour as any of the other dieties why should not the arts and learned studies priuiledge as much as the hall or burse why should not the queen of learning diuinitie raise her followers as high as an other pettie lady about the towne therefore let no man that hath nothing to

alleadge but his fathers conueiances vpbraid our callings and degrees of schooles with superannated cauillations for euen our inferiour graduates haue paid more and deserued better for those their titles of approbation then they that mocke them and only know thus much in themselues that they know nothing worth knowledge
chrysostome as is wel known writeth a tract of set purpose beside many other places of his workes to prooue that a bishop is not onely equall but superiour vnto a king which if it be a straine too high yet it is cleare that the most eminent princes that euer were thought it their glorie to annexe the illumination of priests to the sublimations of their soueraignties
and those greatest prophets esay and daniel that were of the blood royall thought it no disparagement to serue the church bartholmew among the apostles ambrose chrysostome petronius metrophanes eusebius emissenus victorinus cassianus and a number more of the famous bishops were very nobly descended
but what speake of such or of yesterday are not the

sons of dauid the most noble princes of the blood

yet elsewhere tearmed sacerdotes priests not that they were so in proprietie of speech but because that title deciphered the truest honour and best nobility among the auncient worthies
and what is that title and embleme of not onely honour but also vse of that calling which not a prophet of israel to magnifie his owne calling but a king of israel styleth· elisha

by my father my father the chariots of israel and horsemen of the same a predication incompetent to

the greatest monarch

but whether doe digresse in my iust complaint which end with the princely prophet haue mercie

on vs lord for we are vtterly contemned our soule is euen filled in her selfe with the scornefull reproofe of the mighty and with the deceitfulnesse of the proud

to returne then to the point men must not rob peter to pay paul or more truely rob both peter and paul to pay a centurion or gratifie a minion
the church and are two distinct bodies hauing each their offices their charges their pensions concerning which our sauiour hath set downe date caesari quae sunt caesaris deo quae dei sunt

as to the validitie of princes gift in this case who am to decide such questions and yet learned men haue been of this minde that howsoeuer in their owne indiuiduall persons they may by their vnction be inabled to possesse such lands yet may they not transferre the same from themselues to any other not in like sort qualified as things that are alterius fori eminentioris sceptri matters belonging to a higher court and subiect to a greater cognisance
therefore the learned kickerman is so bold as to

binde the hands of princes in this case saying they may not transferre things sacred and dedicate to holy vses no not in case they had been abused to superstition and profanation
and therfore holy bishops as ambrose and bernardus of halbertade in germanie chose rather to die then to part with their churches and church liuings
we read how stoutly that

father did contest with a mightie emperour we yeeld saith he vnto the emperour all that is his due is it his tribute that he doth demaund his tribute we denie not is it the church he doth require we may not betray the church vnto him gods church is none of caesars charge he may not haue to doe therewith

but god of heauen be blessed we neede no such apologie for the kings person who are most bound to god for his maiesties most roiall and religious heart that hath been so farre from taking away that he hath laboured earnestly and zealously to restore backe againe whatsoeuer is essentiall to the church but as for other we say no other but those words of

a homely author paul we know and iesus we know and caesar we know vos autem qui estis but who are you that so defraud iesus and paul and caesar also and so much to them that plead their deserts to churchliuings


come to a second vnworthines bishops do not preach and dignified men do no good conclude therefore may nay must haue

their lands
zenophon did whip young cyrus for a better argument because he gaue the greater coate to the greater boy not because hee had right vnto it but because it fitted him better and the lesser coate to the lesser boy the prince therein offending in distributiue iustice a point of ethicks only
but were zenophon now aliue to iudge of this fact he would feare me hang vp them that should commit such solecismes against ethicks politicks logicke and diuinitie

bishops doe not preach therefore barons must haue their bishopricks why do barons preach church men do no good therfore churles must haue the tithes why do church robbers so much good blush impietie doth he care for preaching that plucks downe the church or he minde goodnes that is enemie to godlines what is this but to straine at a gnat and swallowe a cammel to deuoure the church and cough at the chaire although rest assured it is not the dew of heauen preaching that you looke after but the fat of the earth the pottage and portion of esau
moses gaue a dispensation to quinquagenarians to cease from the ordinarie seruices

of the temple to commence to places of regiment and will you tie the graie haires of age and reuerence to an euerlasting apprentiship of study and speech like your at home to his wonted taske shall your seruitour and horse of seruice and the verie which named haue immunitie and cessation of yeeres and labour and must your spirituall pastor and father your priest and prophet runne rownde in an euerlasting circle damned to this destinie by your inequall doome and clime vp into the pulpit till he can no longer come downe but tumble downe with age and feeblenes to be the miserable laughing stocke of the prophane frie nay are there not more and more honorable and no lesse necessarie seruices for old men then are of young oh teach not thy sonne thy seruant so euill a lesson to curse thee in thy age
the youngest infant in the chimney corner is often

made the rod of gods wrath to reuenge the vnreuerend carriage of a wicked cham to an aged noah
but bishops doe preach witnes the most commendable and indefatigable paines of many of those prelats that are most eminent in the land whom neither this my answer can honour nor your imputation slander
say no more non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis tempus eget

the rest doe no good you say they keepe no houses· is all goodnes in then much of the nobiltie and gentrie of this land doe verie little good yet keep houses not for you perhaps that would liue at free cost yet for their poore neigbours howbeit perchance neither all nor for all nor alwaies for quis ad haec sufficiens but those that doe not what they may aetatem habent leaue to their owne apologies
wherefore this eauill of our vnworthines hold but the idle euaporation of godles braines that hold other men especially our calling worthy of nothing themselues worthie of all but they are not our iudges neither is it reasonable that our enemies should be both our accusers and witnesses and iudges and excutioners also
god did neuer licence any so farre when

the priests were at the verie worst dumbe dogges idol

shepheards drowsie watchmen blinde guides to withhold their dues and good kings haue ordained that no man vnder colour omitted by the minister

shall detaine his tithes and so did the old canons nonnulli vitam clericorum quasi abominabilem

detestantes decimas subtrahere non verentur
but as

thou shalt answer for thy fraud so shall they for their faults
to conclude their vnworthines is questionable but this is out of question that many worthie men are vnworthilie wronged while enuie and auarice sit as iudges of their worth


an other obiection is the muchnes or measure of such demeanes the lands too great the tithes too large and all that fall beside their mouth too much
but in the meane time their apish vanities epicure like superfluities fuliginous fooleries sacrilegious robberies iniuries tarquinian like surquedries esauish profanities and iulianish apostasies are not too much
but to the point which aimes at some reason but lined with much malice
some of the popes clawbacks to daube vp the faults of those holy fathers as haue shewed elswhere maintained that tithes were grounded vpon all the
lawes of moses morall for the equitie ceremoniall for the affinitie iudiciall for the pollicie because the iewes were
tribes whereunto
other were added to make amends for some mens bad payment all vntrue
but if the priests were then

the tenth part of the people where was that proportion before that law but it hath been further prooued that the leuits were not the
nor
nor
part of that people nor the
but at least the sixtieth yet let vs obserue their portion and proportion
the learned downeham hath collected

that the priests income being brought home to them without labour or charge with their
cities was more to them being as the honourable sir

water raleigh hath prooued not much bigger then wales then all the bishopricks benefices colledge lands and all other ecclesiasticall endowments and profits in this land though the popes of rome nor any other had neuer alienated any as now they haue done one halfe
and this was not only among the iewes but from the first preaching of the gospel so soone as the scepter turned christian

all tithes were instantly restored all lands and donations that vnder the persecutions had beene taken away all images treasure and furniture of heathen temples yeerely summes amounting to a great quantitie out of the exchequer it selfe all the goods of such as died intestate all new erections of wel disposed people and to knit vp all in one word the same to be hereditarie as vnder moses

and thus stood the affaires of the church till antichrist confounded things sacred and prophane and cymmeriall darkenes dispossest the world as of illumination so of true deuotion onely some small good meaning did sometimes vndoe themselues to endow the church wherein it became so superlatiuely prodigall that it hath been euer since
and now are we arriued at those times where the children carrie it out much faster then euer their fathers brought it in where our insatiable churchhownds do not as cerberus did with sybillas inchaunted sop

guttera pandens corripuit rursus{que immania terga resoluit fusus

snatch it greedily swallow it

hungerly and lay him downe againe to sleepe quietly but like erisicthon another whelp of the same litter who for sacrilegious famine was fained to be inspired of hunger as hor ingluvies tempestas barathrum{que not macelli but sacelli

nubibus esse quod{que satis poterat populo non sufficit vni

like salomons horseleach that euer cries giue giue

omniscient in espying omnipotent in consuming whom god will one day repaie in like kinde punishing their sinne of greedines with the greedines

of sinning


an other maine obiection is laid hold vpon either by gentlemen that haue trauailed or ministers that relish a little too much of the geneua fashion that other countries doe not mainetaine their ministers by tithes but contributions poore salaries such as the pollicie of men or the iniquitie of times haue left vnto them
but wee are here to dispute not de facto but de iure not what is but what should be done viuendum legibus non exemplis it is not the deedes of men but the doctrine of god that should be our guide for the same countries allow of tolerations shall say or commixtions rather of all kinde of religions

but whatsoeuer other doe either vpon errour or necessitie non fuit sic principio the syncerest times and primest churches haue better presidents

for many haue enthralled theit liuings and liberties together to the importunities of their troubles or abitrement of their kings as the french to carolus

martellus saith gaguine and the churches of saxonie saith aventine who to redeeme their liues

gaue all the vnto the turke though they were redeemed by arnulphus duke of bauoir

and some haue thought that what the bishops in that case haue done is good against themselues but it is to childish to change the most naturall and wise order of the world for an idol of a trauellers braine seeing it can neither be bettered nor paralled with the like some in inequalitie must be confessed which might be redressed which is accidentall no deformitie that is substantiall
and so much of lay mens vsurpations which needed not so much proofe as reproofe

iiii
against the exemptions that some cities and great townes doe clame in church duties

there is an other sort of men that albeit they lurch not the church lands nor count them antichristian yet enfranchise themselues with a false priuiledge that they are as free from the commandement of god in this case or any other ordinance of man concerning that matter as from the rescripts of the sheriffe of the to pay nothing for the maintenance of the minister more then their owne mind shall voluntarie condescend vnto or order taken vpon their agreement at the hall shall make them liable vnto
and therefore it

seemes a thing most absurd and verie vnreasonable that personall tithes of artificers and merchants should be demaunded
by which meanes they sad and dull the hearts of their ministers by a couetous and vnconscionable prescription to allow him nothing but his offrings at easter and a verie small quillet not to be accounted of beside
but they must vnderstand that first at least a personall tithe is due which that poore portion no way doth counteruaile by a thousand part
secondly if not in act yet in equitie some proportionate summe vnto that which god and man hath indifferently set downe
and of this assertion haue these reasons beside those haue set downe in generall


it is the dictate of nature and positiue law of

god to honour god with our riches and the good things of this life as is gods ordinance and as the holy men of god haue done abraham iacob and all the holy nation and all our countrie beside
what charter then or charitie what custome or conscience can be pretended to free vs from that which all the christian world nay all the vniuersall world are bound vnto

they may obiect that one man may serue that turne for a whole citie or towne and for one man their maintenance may be sufficient
first it is not credible or possible that any one should feed more thousands with a morsell of bread then euer christ fedde with
loaues and
fishes
besides what voice or eolus lungs or iron sides may be

sufficient to stretch to so many thousands but that is as grosse as all the rest that he that should take so much paines should haue no more then that slender reward


will not god at his generall audit obiect this vnto such that labourers in the countrie and fishermen in poore townes of the coast whom he neuer honoured with the tenth of their ease the twentieth of their opportunity the hundreth part of their happines yet returne him by tithe a couuenient portion of their labours his blessing but these that ought to haue been manie miles before them in godlines come short of them many leagues in gratefullnesse

the parable of the talents is well knowne and remembred but not euer practised and therefore god many times sends vs other remembrancers pirats at sea and prowlers at land to consume our substance bringing men ofttimes from the wealth and pride of the cittie to the want and drudgerie of the countrie for such forgetfullnesse and contempt


the seruice vnder the law was a costly seruice where men were to allocate the third part of their estate to the ministration of the tabernacle what by sacrifices of all sorts what by peculiar charges rising on some occasions but vnder poperie this charge was doubled and trebled where the third part of the land went to the blinde and the lame clergie
from the first we are freed by christ from the second by christian princes
what to be exempt as by a magna charta from all suit and seruice that belongs

to god no but wee are still tied to performe to god an honorable seruice that his gospel may be continued his praier perpetuated his ministers maintained his houses repaired his members comforted his infanterie nursed his seruants saued
what pittie is it then to see so many sheep without shepheards so many shepheards without meanes that of so many parishes as are many times found in such places all the wages of single and double halls together not able to amount to one sufficient stipend of a good minister that is to say where the most housholders shal giue a matter of two shillings two pence to his minister by the yeare and the best but fowre shillings fowre pence speake within compasse vnder
shillings and yet some of these men by their owne esteem and other mens worth many thousands and as they are merchants may gaine many hundreds of pounds that yeere
and where may be challenged that euen this in all the towne and citie through may rise to more then a competent liuing for one man though spake of no more then the parish maintenance will put all the lecturers wages in beside it will not so bee more then enough or competent when all can accrew hardly to
pounds by the yeare and that to such a man as speak of and they should labour for yet scarce competent for why should we not value a godly learned well borne man and minister in equal ranke with the best merchant when as in such an one the summe would be but beggerie yea no way but in wealth qualified like the other


and because haue mentioned the ministers person let that be another motiue the loue we are to shew vnto them
now what kindnes can this be to defraud him of his true allowance and to mince him out such mites and micas crumbs as commonly men do and count him highly beholding to them for that also will not say as tullie doth in like case that it is latr onis beneficium who thinke the traueller is much bound vnto him for his life which hee might haue taken as well as his purse but this say feare me those men that now in the libertie of the gospel deny vs our owne if any other colour of religion should turne trumpe wil hardly giue vs their owne


another cause why such places should pay personall tythes or like liberall maintenance is the securing of their owne estates for this small tribute that we doe so returne our god is sepes diuitiarum the fence of our fortunes and causeth the legittimation of our other goods
for men must imitate the

apostle to cast superfluities to secure the vessell and willingly to part with some portion to saue the stake whereas now men are growne like vsurers not to deale with god almightie himselfe without sufficient sureties and bond besides
the charge which they pretend daily to grow vpon them for impost are meere cauillations for that they fetch vp againe vpon the poore countrie and themselues grow rich the while


lastly would they doe as the mother citie where they pay not by the hal but by the rent of the

house the tenth of that as is thinke intended by the statute they would procure both wealth and wisdome loue and learning religion and renowne to wreath them a chaplet to make them happie and all their daughters and neighbours by them where bountifull meanes allures the best men and kind vsage of all that comes drawes all the learning of the land vnto them for vbi populus ibi questus vbi cadauer ibi aquilae whereas now the niggardize that is vsed in many places breeds many vnkindnesses between the ministers and people and the small meanes the minister hath to liue on breeds him basenesse basenes contempt contempt discouragement and on both sides all the dislike and vnfriendly words and wishes that may be imagined
by these reasons am induced to mislike the course that runnes common in great places and to reuoke men to the right and prime institution

but guiltinesse is neuer without and mans nature is stubborne not to yeeld to the word
some pretend pouertie and in that case men are to be pitied not burdened therefore god requires according

to that we haue not according as we haue not to vse liberalitie much more gratuity to god and their minister
yet it is not equall that men not hauing to their minds should therefore pay nothing but eate or spend gods part as they doe their own
and who in these places is so poore that hee doth not feast once or ofter in the yeare in such sort that the very reuersion of their riot would not be a comfortable refreshing to his minister if he had it in mony

but pouertie is not alwaies truely pretended for compare the husbandman with the citizen in diet apparell house furniture building expences and then tell me which is the poorer there am sure the townesman will haue all things excellent whatsoeuer it cost so that he is rich at home poor at the

church as one saies etsi in domibus sunt auro diuites tamen in ecclesia sunt mendici for their own occasion they will find mony but for gods they cannot spare it


they are subiect to many charges and greater losses then those of the countrie and is that any cause to denie god his tribute that is the minister his due should thinke that binds them to be more thankefull for his fauour mercie and prouidence as

we see in the israelites beeing but a small band yet vanquished fiue kings of madian first parted with one halfe of the prey vnto their fellowes that went not into the field and of the other moitie gaue a tribute to god one of
and further for gods vnexpected deliuerance hauing not missed one man offered vnto him of their owne accord another oblation of the iewels and ornaments of the pillage to the value of
shekels of gold

but we can be content to offer vnto god as many good words as he will but no mony but then we

verifie the speach of the father we do not offer vitulos labiorum but labia vitulorum not the calfs of the

lips but the lips of calues
and as another we will seeke christ with the wise men but we wil leaue our budgets at home we will not open our treasures to

him as they did
dauid had a quid retribuam what

shall render to the lord for all his benefits that he hath done to me but we point where is none quid retribuam what shall render vnto the lord any thing ill done


he would so be too rich and too well acquainted with our estates

this is to bee wiser then god for he made no such prouiso

what hurt if thy minister knew in generall nay in particular the blessing or cursing of god vpon thee were that any harme to thy soule thou shalt be sure of one comfort to haue one that will simpathize with thee and one that will supplicat for thee
lastly for will not follow these foxes to any more holes if ministers would not challenge it of debt but take it as almes or contribution or beneuolence they should fare better
this is a burthen too heauy to be borne especially where all commodities are so high rated as they are


why should any account that burthen ouerheauy which god hath laid vpon them
which other beare cheerefully that are farre more vnable
that brings so great benefit and blessing with it to haue the light of goshen when other sit in the darknesse of egypt
that is a thing so necessarie
which our predecessours yeelded so willingly vnto to bind themselues and their heires for euer to perform
or what comfort is it to impropriate in this manner that which god and all good men haue annexed is it dishonour to acknowledge a debt to our better a duty to our prince a tribute to our god is

it dishonest for the minister that in gods behalfe doth require the same why then should we be angry with him that tells vs what is due or to raile on them that refute our falshood this snarling against the preacher is but recalcitrating against the word
it is not the man but the matter to haue our couetousnes detected our oppression checked our vsury reprooued our extortion ransanked it is mammon that stings vs not the minister that offends vs but beware what ye shall doe in this case to bee pricked in heart for our fault is one thing but to pricke his heart that discouers our sins is not to stomacke him but his sender to omit a truth or duty vpon ignorance is one thing but to oppugne the truth out of malice is an other
sacriledge may goe single but if it be combined with obstinacie and obstinacie attended with impenitencie where before there was but one deuill now there will bee seuen and where there might haue been hope of reformation there godly minds will feare an ende in desperation
and so leaue this point

hitherto we haue had to deale with them that play at now come to the pettielassons of the church if may so call them such as either by sacrilegious substractions or iniurous calumniations or customarie compositions or coloured

extortions circumuent the minister and defalke of his duties

for not to mooue the same question so oft though tithes were not of gods owne institution but of meere humane imposition yet now beeing consecrated to god whosoeuer shall vnder any pretence diminish the same let them look how they can wash their vnholy hands from ananias fault

the people in many places haue taken vp the trade of the vniust steward in steed of to set

downe
and to write in their ministers right
for

so many customes are extant and compositions so many priuileges and prescriptions so common supersedeas and prohibitions that he that seemes best prouided in that kinde hath his liuing pared to his hands much after the manner of a banburie cheese whose very parings are more then all the meate
let a minister complain hereof they answer with the iewes we haue a law but such lawes are against

their lord and such customes eat out the heart of all conscience
such customes the auncient and moderne pharisies did vse to obtrude but we answer to both as augustine to the donatists veritate

manifestata cedat consuetudo veritati and again nemo sit qui ausit preferre consuetudinem veritati when the truth is once knowne let old customes giue place vnto it and let none be so bold as to prefer custome to truth

and cyprian si consuetudini suffragatur veritas nihil consuetudine debet esse firmius sin consuetudinem

stabiliat impietas eadem facilitate reijcitur quae affertur

if custome doth relie vpon truth it is reason nothing should infringe it but if your customes be built vpon trecherie they may be as easily refused as

they are tendred
but god hath forbidden his people to doe after the fashions of the heathen and our sauiour saith chrysostome did not alledge that he was custome but truth

there are two kinde of customes that are not good
consuetudo peccandi quae tollit sensum non reatum peccati
vetustas erroris quae quo magis obtinet magis grauet
there is a custome of sin which takes away the custome but not the guilt of sinning and there is an antiquity of errour the which the more it is in request the more it offends

but to say all in a word the canonists haue well confined the valitidie of customes consuetudo non derogat iuri naturali seu diuino therefore all such customes as are derogatorie to the church are to be reuersed

now what are the customes that are laid in our dish for the most part but impious iniurious vnreasonable absurd vnconscionable and vnnaturall


gods word doth legimate the minister in all

the goods of the auditor
now all and small the whole and none doe differ much meere contradictories cannot stand both together

the law of nature

saies thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne custome of some places doth not onely muzzle the teachers mouth but cut his

throat leauing him so small a portion as if it were to diet him for surfeit not to reward him for seruice

the law of nations saith the labourer is worthie of his hire and christendome hath determined this portion of wages but custome saith we haue contrarie customes to all the world late exemptions other dispensations and thus in effect we sill vp the measure of those auncient hypocrits transgressing

the commaundement of god by our traditions

but of this point will speake no more but referre the reader to the writings of ma
eburne that

in
or
treatises hath taken good paines in this point and conclude

if this plea will not be taken in that we had a custome in our parish not to come to seruice nor to receiue the sacraments nor to keepe the kings peace how doe we thinke it will be taken at gods tribunall seat at the dreadfull day of iustice to plead the custome was such where we had abode to be impious sacrilegious prophane vnconscionable and cruell to god and man to abridge the minister of his due god of his seruice our soules of their comfort therefore be not deceiued god is not

mocked for whatsoeuer a man soweth that shall he reap if to the flesh corruption if to the spirit life euerlasting

but beside custome which then when it tooke beginning might haue some reason though time hath now eat out those letters there is cosenage also pretending custome and it is not so or detaining that which is most due by palpable wrong or coloured forgerie in all which cases the world is verie

prone to fauour themselues and the best cauiller against the parson is reputed the best parishioner
some plead that tithes are not due iure diuino and therefore lawfull to catch what they can from him but first as in a case of lesse consequence when

once it was strongly avouched the enemy would not giue battel on that side it was replied but if he do are we not then vndone so say here if they be of diuine right are we not then plaine robbers resisters of god therefore as he stultum est in id periculi remconijcere vbi si in credendo erraueris nulla dabitur corrigendi copia it is a mad venture to put the matter to such a push where if our iudgment be miscaried we are irrecouerably vndone

though that hath bin already proued· that tithes are due by diuine right yet this cannot excuse them from sacriledge that with a si spie shall diminish the ministers portion for now they are dedicated to holy vse therefore what god hath called holy let no man dare to profane or lay theeuish fingers vpon them

the accent that sounds to profit we affix our marginall note vnto it hoc facit pro nobis
the slightest reasons the singlest pretences the falsest syllogismes the fowlest elenchs the simplest shews are of force omnipotent to carry vs that way fauores ampliandi but the strongest proofes the soundest arguments the euidentest demonstrations the authoritie of scriptures the iudgements of the fathers the decrees of councils the determination of lawes the consent of times the concurrence of opinions the clamours of conscience are vtterly voide of force and quite

to draw vs to part with odia restringenda

there was at rome one clodia not all of the best report who when the ship that brought vp berecynthia the mother of the gods was stroke on ground as it passed vp the riuer so as no strength of hand nor helpe of people could fetch her off this honest vestall vpon her knees besought the goddesse that if shee were innocent of that imputation that was strong vpon her she would be pleased to follow the guidance of her girdle and so fitting the same vnto the pinnace that which thousands of hands nor all the strength of rome could not effect verie gently came off without more adoe the like good lucke this cause in hand hath euer had the deepest disputes of learned schooles which no wit could vnwind like an other gordius nodus the rustiest reason of a country farmer can as easily snap in sunder as samson did his withes or hempen bands

but let them learne to eat their owne bread and not say with the strumpet stolne bread is sweete for

the bread of deceit will turne to grauell and the manna that is gathered contrarie to commaundement will turne to wormes and the gathering of treasures by a deceitfull tongue is but vanitie tossed to and fro of them that seeke death

remember that protestation little lesse then an execration which the people were solemnly to take at the end of euerie haruest when thou hast made an

end of tithing all the tithes of thy encrease and hast giuen it to the leuite that they may eate within thy gates

and be filled then thou shalt say before the lord thy god haue brought the hallowed thing out of my house and haue also giuen it to the leuite according to thy commaundement which thou hast commaunded me haue not transgressed thy commaundements nor forgotten them haue not eaten thereof in my mourning nor taken ought thereof for any common vse nor giuen ought thereof for the dead but haue hearkned vnto the voice of the lord my god and haue done according to all that thou hast commaunded me looke downe out of thy holy habitation from heauen and blesse thy people israel accordingly
now if should demand what law pertained this vnto if to the ceremoniall it must prefigure something in or vnder christ if morall it stands in force if meerely iudiciall yet the equitie doth binde perpetually so euery way it bindeth still
and therefore as in triall of the suspected wife if shee were innocent the potion made her fruitfull if nocent painefull so is this oath to true dealers with god and his minister profitable to vniust detainers· damnable
and so ende with them

against the stipulation of simoniacall patrons for tithes or church preferments

the last offenders that will encounter are such magnificoes and gentlemen of eminencie whom god or gold hath made patrons of those places where they haue their lands
which right

how it was purchased dispute not at this time only thus much in the times of superstition those offices or priuiledges together with the lands were devolued to the abbies and when the abbies were suppressed they became vulgare aucupium very common game and when all those things were set to sale by the drumme then nemo non fecit lignationem they that had monie and appetite caught vp these commodities and so haue the patronages of the church been ingrossed into great mens hands that oft times vse them neither as patronages nor things of the church for those poore collations that should be bestowed vpon schollers and were indeed deposita pietatis the pledges of pietie doctrinae praemia the rewards of learning laborantium stipendia the wages of holy workemen and sanctorum munera the gifts of holy men haue quite been put to other imployments not giuen at all or giuen to some old seruing men or kept in the patrons owne hand or sore curtaild in the putting off or saued for pensions for yonger sonnes or sold in a market to the best chapmen that we may truely verifie that quip of gregorie boues arant asini pascuntur laborious

schollers take the paines and idle drones eate vp the gaines

for the common sort of patrons haue vsed vs for all the world as the iesuites do their nouices whom they promise faire till they haue put themselus and their states into their hands and then they euer after vse them in the nature of younger brethren so do these newe masters handle vs who were once

and had somewhat of our owne but now are turned out of our gownes into a lighter habit by annexing the church maintenance to their owne inheritance and then feeding vs with pittances as sitting in the place of praier or if they vse vs any better then words it is after we haue sued our liuery and fined for our match
but as tully saies nullae sunt occultiores insidiae quàm quae latent in simulatione officij there is no snare to that which goes vnder the shew of seruice

the first institution of patronage in the church as is commonly in other cases ex malis moribus bonae leges was excellent and necessarie but as the faire streames of iordan fall into the dead sea so in the current of like conueniences through the fault or frailtie of mans nature the verie best things degenerate so fel it out here for as it was said of the clergie religio peperit diuitias sed filia deuorauit matrem so is it true of the laitie the church did first hatch them but they haue eaten out the bellie of the dam

marsil
patauinus in his defensor pacis hath set down their originall in this manner antiquitùs viri sancti ministri euangelici christum imitari volentes contra nullum voluerunt contendere iudicio
in old time the holy men and sincere ministers of the gospel desirous to imitate christ would not contest in law with any
therefore the proprietie of such temporals as were appointed for their maintenance remained in the founder or donor of holy demeanes who beeing so ordained for the maintenance and defence of the churches lands were called the

patrons thereof
for so soone as religion began to grow into some dimensions and the church to get some matters of inheritance enuie and auarice began to be too busie about her so as shee had much adoe to hold her owne or recouer her right and so fast did the eagles follow her carrion and the birds of pray stoope for bootie that the decrees of almost
synods and councils besides decrees of the first

popes and statutes of emperors were all too little to curbe their couetousnes or restraine the harpies from deuouring all while the holy and heauenly minded clergie were loth to intangle themselues with secular incumbrances or giuing ouer their bookes follow worldly profits
whereupon to salue this sore it was decreed in the councill melevitanum that a petition should be drawn and presented to the emperours arcadius and honorius that they would be pleased to appoint the church certen delegates or aduocates to defend their rights the like was done at other times who at the first did not bestow the liuings but onely defend their lands
and founders of new erections reserued no other power in themselues but the bare aduocation and presentment to the place
it were too long and intricate to follow the mutations of the times while sometime the donors sometime the donees sometime the patrons and lastly the bishops did manage all the busines that way till in the ende deuotion had surrendered all right into the hands of new erections out of their zeale vnto the regular order of friers and so when the religious houses were put downe

these went also with the other lands into the fowlers net and became euery mans purchase as said before

now what affinitie haue the moderne with the former patrons if these be our defenders who shall defend vs from our verie defenders the abuse is euident need not open it the presentor and presentee haue changed offices the scholler must present the patron with church angels or he shall not bee presented

to be an angel of the church qui primi debent esse ad subsidium primi sunt ad sacrilegium her prime succours are become her principall suckers and cheifest pillars the cheifest powlers
our song of venite exultemus is turned to super flumina babylonis simon magus hath succeeded simon peter the buyers

and sellers whom christ whipped out of the temple are let in againe at the posterne doore

which sinne although in proprietie of speach it notes but the buyer yet now the whole transaction of that market is commonly so called because simon magus profered monie not for any infusion of grace vpon himselfe but for the multiplication of his coine to the best improouement as diuines haue noted

and herein the canonists haue obserued many enormities as atheisme idolatrie theft and murder

for making the church non domum oratioonis sed negotiationis not a house of prayer but a hole for prey

for turning god into gold and making not godlines their gaine but ganie their godlines

for robbing their parishes of the bread of

life

staruing the incumbent with vnrecouerable penurie of bodie and periurie of soule and the whole parrish with him both of bodily releefe and ghostly life

so that we may renew the old rime of such kind of clearks that was once of the pope in euerie mans mouth

tales regunt petri nauem ligandi potentiam

tales gerunt petri clauem

hi nos docent sed indocti indicat scientiam

hi nos ducent nox nocti

such men peters shippe doe steare and power to bind and lose

such men peters keyes doe beare

these teach vs and themselues lacke light her knowledge doth disclose

these lead vs and so night to night

and therfore as said while ere the church is little beholden to such patrons for these resemble the beutiful gate of the temple or faire porches of the poole of bethesda where lie a great number of lazars expecting the waters next motion the churches next promotion wherein they haue faire occasion to demerite both of god and men for god who sees not how much he might be glorified if that care were taken in the choise of a worthy preacher that ought to be and as for men it is equally apparant what

profit would redound to the world for instruction and edification
but in my poore vnderstanding in the neglect of this so pious seruice to god and to his church as they are faultie and defectiue to both them so no way more preiudicious then to themselues not onelie in the account that they shall one day giue of that stewardship but in depriuing themselues in the meane time of a learned friend a godly associate and a ghostly aduocate for who is so fit to conuerse familiarly with a gentle or noble man then such a minister who both for his honest birth and liberall breeding sweete learning and wise counselling may be both an adiuvant for his soules health as an ornament to his worldly state
for if it be true that scientia be vitae sol and amicitia vitae sal knowledge the light and freindship the delight of this life how darke and vnsauorie must his life needes be that depriues himselfe in the place where he doth or should liue of a learned counsellour and friendly comforter

but how euer their owne occasions may be to be called to higher places in their owne persons yet euery noble minded moses should labour to remooue this stone which the enuyous madianites haue rowled vpon the wells mouth that the lords flockes may be seasonably watered least that both for the present the world be pestered with that haue eies and see not eares and heare not tongues and speake not of which the prophet speaketh

they that make them are like vnto them and in the next age the world be ouergrowne with barbarousnes

rousnes to the vtter preiudice both of church and commonwealth

all which as me seemes were not hard to be helped if either the oath of simonie were equally tendered to patron and petitioner or all presentations to churches were in the hands of colledges and vniuersities where no such corruption for the multitude of the suffrages were to be feared
whereupon further conueniences would likewise accrew both the making roome for younger schollers and ridding the springs of old students which lie there in great number some
yeares to their own greife and the churches losse but to vpbraid the world of the times iniquitie and learnings miserie
and so much concerning the abuses

the second part of the application which is instructiue
chap
of the seuerall vses of this doctrine
as they that haue been present at some dolefull tragedie or solemne exequie of some of their dearest friends executed for causes criminall especially if they themselues haue been any way accessarie to the same cannot but be much affected both sleeping affrighted with melancholie visions and waking astarted with dumpish passions which leaue the impressions of verie sad remembrance long time after in their minds so we that here haue had not the dismall storie related but the deadly spectacle of ananias and sapphiraes suffering as if it were euen acted before our eies neere friends of ours am assured associats and copartners in wicked sacriledge if we be not void of all humanitie it must of force affect vs very deepely and peirce our hearts to the very quicke with a true prognosticate of our end and iudgement

therefore like ioabs men that followed the chace vpon abners host when they came to the place where asael lay wallowing in his blood there made

a stand in wonder pitie how so braue a man came to so bloodie a death so let vs make a pause at ananias graue and in wonder and horror somewhat chew vpon the matter and frame the argument but in this manner to our selues


if ananias that might otherwise be a good man at lest one ciuilly righteous and outwardly religious enough fauouring good men and countenancing good matters
if he that committed this sinne but once in all his life and made no trade of it nor liuing in it as in a knowne sinne either yeeres or monthes as we doe
that did it not in so high a measure nor so heinous manner by the lumpe and the load as we doe not mincing one manner onely but mouthing many
that had no example before his eies of the wrath of god against that sinne no ananias and sapphira stroke dead before his face to feare him from it at lest so fully
that had not the meanes of conuincing his conscience by scriptures or arguments by examples or euidences of the fowlnesse of the fact as we haue had so plainely
that did not professe it in the sight of the sun nor bolster it vp with open conrestations nor blanch it off with fearefull execrations as many of vs haue done


if shee that came in but as accessarie onely and vpon the by for her husbands sake alone which

humane lawe would either approoue or at least not punish


lastly if they that faulted in a matter of their owne donation wherunto no law did enforce them no bond compell them but their owne free mindes and voluntary promise if they say had so heauie a doome as not to die the common death of other men nor to be visited after the visitation of other folke but that god did shew a new worke vpon them a strange example a fearefull iudgement to strike them dead to kill them presently to slay them suddenly to denie them repentance to curse them with an euerlasting curse to sammatize them as hath been shewed then let vs make a true commensuration of our owne demerits and bethinke our selues how we shall escape that haue all things contrary and opposite in direct angles in comparison of them

as in whom there is no goodnesse at all not so much as demure carriage to extenuate our sinnes or our iudgement in the least respect with god or the world

that doe no seruice all our life long from the cradle to the graue but many study how to wrong god and rifle his church sorrowing for nothing but that they sinne no more

that offend not onely in tanto but in toto enuying our ministers halfe a liuing but swallowing our selues many churches in act or in desire the meane while


that sinne not of ignorance as he might but

of malice not of infirmitie but of presumption nor confessing it with repentance but professing it with obstinance


that haue not one ananias before our eyes but many nor single men but millions confounded with iudgements and howling out of hell discite iustitiam moniti non diuos

that come not to our purpose with single impietie but with fraud and oppression with oaths and peierations as if sacriledge were not sufficient without such milstones to sinke vs to hell

that come not in as accessaries onely for others companie but breaking the yce and shewing example as prime and principall onely sorrie we sin no more

that doe no good our selues non suffer other but doing ill our selues and teaching other that inuade the holy patrimonie our selues and perswade other that giue nothing our selues but robbe others
these and many more the like considerations which we may represent vnto our selues should be so many arguments to disswade vs so many thunderbolts to feare vs not ratling in our eares onely but battering our conscience also and tearing our soules with the fearefull expectance of deserued vengeance

if we should but thus enforce this argument from their action to our instruction it could not but startle and amaze a great number that now lie and die in a maine peice of athcisme without all sense or remorse

and so goe downe to hell before they once know what they doe qui tantum non audit fragorem

non dormit sed mortuus est hee that heares not this peice of ordnance is not asleepe but starke dead wants not so much sence as soule is not a man but a verie monster

augustine doth teach vs this instruction saying of the rich glutton si sterilitas in ignem mittitur rapacitas quid meretur si qui sua non dedit semper ardebit quid recipiet is qui aliena tulit if vnfruitful men shall be cast into hell what doe they that are iniurious deserue and if hee shall burne in euerlasting flames that gaue nothing of his owne how shall he be saued that takes away that which is other mens and if he be so fearefully punished that offends in a little what hell of hels shall suffice for such as robbe and rifle all that is holy bereauing almightie god of his worship and seruice the church of god of that which is sanctified to religion the saints of god of the instruments of saluation for this sinne must be apparelled in his own circumstances things consecrate by holy men dedicated to almightie god so peculiar vnto his seruice sinning with so high a hand impouerishing our soules soliciters in famishing many hundreds of bodily ghostly prouision defrauding our selues of the bread of life and many such like
well then to come to the particular vses

the first is feare against securitie this is taught vs out of the fearefull iudgement that fell vpon ananias and the prime vse that the congregation made

of the same what effect it did worke namely to affect and raise some passion in the heart in generall
secondly what that was in particular the affection of feare
thirdly the measure or extension great feare
fourthly the subiect in whom in those that heard it
and lastly the vniuersalitie of the subiect not one or two or a few but all so many as heard those things

the like we find in other places the like impression vpon the like occasion when the israelites saw the great worke of the lord vpon the egyptians it is noted that the people feared the lord and beleeued the lord his seruant moses the same is obserued of dauid in the sudden breach of vzza dauid was afraid of

the lord that day so that he durst not bring home the arke to his house many like examples are extant in the holy pages

the reason is this we neuer feare god so well as when we are awaked with his thunders and roused with his iudgements for euery affection must be raised by his proper obiect loue by his mercies hope by his promises trust by his prouidence and feare by his iudgements

now in his iudgements god is set out vnto vs as a terrible god a consuming fire and therefore a fearefull

thing to fall into his hands therefore the apostles admonish vs paul to worke out our saluation with feare

and trembling and peter for as much as we call him father

that without respect of persons iudgeth according to euerie mans worke to passe the time of our pilgrimage here in feare

but as moses complaineth who regardeth the power of his wrath answearing himselfe in his owne

interrogation as esay els where who hath beleeued our report surely none or very few luther thus resolues the question who none before affliction either on himselfe or another for men haue a double curtaine drawne betweene god and them
first of proud knowledge or presumption a knowledge without the feeling a bare speculation without answearable affection that which god doth so oft complaine of

eies without seeing eares without hearing hearts without vnderstanding vnderstanding without practising such a sense as is betweene sleeping and waking such a as is betweene cold and hot such a consent as is betweene choosing and refusing

the second is hardnes of heart that when his iudgements be thundered we feare not when his mercies are proclamed we reioyce not when exhortations are vsed we mooue not as the wise man

saith because sentence against euill works is not presently executed therefore the hearts of the children of men are set to doe euill that which we heare doth little profit vs for still we thinke as we heard out of plato that gods words are vntrue or his arme is but weake
for the first he that hath verified all his prophecies and promises hitherto why should we doubt of the effect of his threats to sinne if all is not performed in our time yet there is another place to consummate his word and make good his promises

for the second he that put downe both all the monarches and magicians of the world with the

production of the lest vermine the worke of his little finger how should he be impotent or weake in auenging on vs whatsoeuer we doe sinne the burning of the world is but the breath of his nostrils and if all this be little he can arme himselfe with deadly weapons bows swords speeres armies of creatures chariots of fire millions of angels and if this also be yet but little he is purtraied moreouer as a gyant and that armed cap a pe as a lion nay all that is strong a iudge a generall a prince a god

againe if he be weake who are we or what is our strength not such as hee needes to come against vs with all his power with crowes of iron or greatest ordnance but with grasses strawes haires wormes if they should also be to seeke but to commit vs together dash vs one against another therefore we are to feare him in himselfe much more when he ariseth to rage when he speaketh threatneth striketh
the prisoner that is attached for criminall causes feareth the comming of the iudge the idolater that is not in his religion secured feareth before his painted timber or stone the deuill that is ascertained of his torment feareth at the thought of his iudge and god therefore he that feareth not god making his sword drunken with sinners blood is more desperate then the ruffian more doltish then the idolater more damnable then the verie deuill and this shall serue for the first vse


care against impietie it hath been obserued by

wise men that the word conscientia hath in all times had very hard successe so that it neuer could be full written together in all his syllables for in the first nonage of the church the primer times they had con and sci but wanted entia for as another saith they had aureos sacerdotes but lignea vasa golden chaplaines and wooden chalices good conscience and great learning but small reuennewes
the middle times had con and entia but wanted sci honestie and honour but little or no learning
these last ages wherein we liue haue aboundance of the sci but haue lost both con and entia learning gods plentie but our good meaning and good meanes are gone one to seeke the other in which regard our pietie is become very proportionable to our charitie cold and comfortlesse like the doctors recipes which demosthenes

speaks of neither so sufficient to keep aliue nor so deficient to let vs die

it is an error may say an heresie to thinke that lost that goes to god
there began iudas treason at quorsum perditio haec to what purpose is all this wast

victus sacerdotum largior argumentum est pietatis publicae it is a signe religion is going when we see

the ministers are well maintained
and another pietas est pro pietate sumptum facere it is a part of religion to spend our goods vpon religion
whereupon

hierom speaking of the poore widdow that increased donaria dei the holy treasure with her two mites as many other holy men and women did saith thus implantes illud quod scriptum est redemptio

animae viri diuitiae eius they fulfilled the saying of the prophet a mans riches are the redemption of his soule

and cyprian vt intelligamus haec omnia deo dari cum quisquam haec facit deum promereri christus illa do
dei appellat
that we might learne that all these things are giuen to god and when any doth thus doth make god his debter christ tearmeth them gods donaries therfore so long as these stand good our feare of god our care of his seruice our constancie in his religion stands vpright but if we let them fall or plucke them downe our commerce doth cease with heauen we renounce our right in heauen our portion in the sonne of god of heauen
and so much briefely of the vses

the complaints of sundrie learned and godly men for the wrongs to the church of god

neither is this the complaint of one or two discontented men as the world is made beleeue but many more both in former time when things were not altogether so euill as bernard serm

dealing they neuer prospered but lost to the turke lost to their neighbours went downeward strangely both at home and abroad and were neuer able to stand on their legs as they had done before
but descend to lower times for as to the former may well vse the bernardus non vidit omnia and as to the latter bede in comparison of vs had no cause to betake him to his beads

luther of the places and times of reformation

saies thus haue often wondered why the apostle so oft and earnestly exhorteth the churches to nourish their teachers for in the time of popery saw all men giue frankly to the building and the guilding of their gorgious temples to the liberall maintaining of the idolatrous seruice so that the clergie euery where possessed the most and best lands of all countries in so much that thought it superfluous for god to giue any such commaundement for as much as they abounded and with plentie of all things
thought it more needefull to perswade men to hold their hands then to giue any more for obserued how by this excessiue liberality the couetousnesse of the clergie did but more encrease and the rest of the world grew very poore
but now see the reason why they did abound in that measure and wee on the contrary suffer so much want
in former time when nothing else was taught but error and idolatrie they grew so wealthy that of peters patrimonie when himselfe had neither siluer nor gold the popes had aduanced themselues aboue emperours cardinals aboue kings bishops

aboue princes but since the time that the gospell came in preachers haue euer been as poore as euer christ was
we finde then by lamentable experience how necessarie this precept of well maintaining the ministers is in the world which paul both here and elsewhere so insists in and beates vpon
therefore when read this exhortation of paul both muse and blush that so great an apostle should vse so many words about this matter
would bee loth to slaunder and defame this countrie which is nothing in comparison of corinth which hee so much shamed by begging for the ministers and the saints
but this see is the lot of the gospel that not only no man is forward to giue to schollers and the clergie but euery man is ready to spoyle and take away that which they haue
in briefe men seeme to degenerate to sauage and cruell beasts for all the while that men did teach and preach vnto them the doctrine of deuills they were euen to prodigalitie to those deceiuers but to those that deale the word of god sincerely they enuie that they haue and thinke euery thing too much

by which we perceiue how necessarie this exhortation is euen to true professors sathan can abide nothing worse then the light of the gospel which when he sees to breake forth hee labours tooth and nayle to hinder it both by false spirits and bloodie persecutions and famishing vp the teachers
and because he could not here suppresse it by any of the former meanes of false doctrine or opposition he attempteth it by the latter by withdrawing the liuing

of ecclesiasticall persons to cause them by pouertie and necessitie to forsake their standing and so the people wanting instructors to grow wild and wicked
this deuise the deuil sets forward by wicked magistrates in cities and townes noblemen and gentlemen in the country who take away the churches reuenewes whereby the ministers should bee maintained and conuert them to profanenes as the

prophet micah complaineth from the hire of an harlot it came and to the hire of an harlot it shall returne again
some other he diuerteth from the gospel with too much abundance for when the word of god is plentifully taught many fall a loathing and neglecting of it and fewe will set their sonnes to schoole or to diuinitie but apply them rather to more gainfull trades

it is not then without need that paul warnes all auditors to communicate with their pastors in all their goods it being sit and equal to requite spiritual things with temporall
but both court and country towne and citie doth abuse this doctrine at this day vnder colour thereof to inrich themselues

in poperie great summes were giuen vnto the priests for masses dirges trentals and such trash begging friers had likewise their shares besides that which pardons indulgences and other antichristian merchandize carried away from these and a number more the like extortions we are freed by the gospell but we are so farre from thankefulnesse to god that of prodigall giuers we are become sacrilegious takers and grow for bestowing any

thing vpon the religion and saints of god which is an infallible token that men haue lost both the word and saith and all goodnesse together for it is impossible for such as are religious indeede to see their pastors liue in want and necessitie
for as much then as they ioy to see their ministers bare and poore keeping their liuings from them or not paying them so sincerely as they should it is more then manifest that they are worse then the very heathen
but they shall feele ere long what will followe vpon this in gratitude by the losse both of temporall and spirituall blessings for it is impossible but this sinne must bee both speedily and heauily auenged and am perswaded that the churches of galatia corinth and the rest were so pestered with false apostles for no other cause but the small account they made of their true teachers for it is a iust reward that they that wil not giue a penie to god the author of all blessings and goodnesse should giue pounds to the deuill the author of all euill and euerlasting miserie and that hee that will not serue god with a little to his owne eternall renumeration should serue the deuil with much to his vtter and ineuitable confusion

neuerthelesse it is not the apostles meaning that men should giue away all that they haue but onely such liberall maintenance that their ministers may liue in honest and decent fashion
and this he prosecuteth further adding a fearefull commination to his former reproofe and exhortation saying god is not mocked where he toucheth to the quicke the peruersenesse of men who proudly and profanely despise

their ministers and make themselues sport with their miseries as great men for the most part doe that make their pastors their very abiects and vassals so that if we had not a godly prince we had long ere this been driuen out of the country
for when the pastors demaund their dues or complaine of their wants the fashion of men is to exclaime that priests are couetous and would haue they know not what no man is able to satisfie their asking if they were true gospellers indeede they should possesse nothing but in great perfection follow their master christ
therefore the apostle grieuously threatneth such mockers and blasphemers so despitefully and inhumanely scorning and insulting on their poore ministers yet forsooth will seem great gospellers as if hee should say beware you despisers although god deferre his punishment for a season yen in his good time he will finde you out and punish· you for this profanenesse and hate against his ministers you deceiue not him but your selues and your wrong will not pertaine to him but returne into your bosome

and yet our proud gentlemen and citizens are little mooued with these dreadfull threats who at their death shall well vnderstand that they haue not mocked vs but themselues in the mean time howsoeuer superciliously they laugh at our present admonitions we will speake this to our owne comfort knowing it is better to receiue then to infer wrong for patience is euer ioyned with innocence and god will not suffer vs to want but when the lions

shall lacke we shall haue enough
thus far that great and worthie man of god luther whose pen and paines god did so powerfully vse and blesse in the worke of the restauration of the world
vnto whom will adioyne another great instrument of gods glorie and the light of his church iohn caluin· whose name hath terror attending on it in the kingdome of poperie to this day
where let me obserue one thing very remarkeable that these great saints so mightie in·word and deed yet hauing done what was in men to doe against false doctrine yet could neuer put out this inbred irreligion as if this sinne were in the church as it is written of the heart in the bodie primum viuens vltimum moriens or like death the first and last enemie we should encounter
but what saith caluin we must needs confesse

that our bowels are of iron and our hearts of brasse that are no more touched with the reading of this story where the faithfull giue so bountifully that which they had whereas we at this day cannot be content to hold our owne hands from giuing any thing onely but most iniuriously take away also that which is giuen by other they did simply and honestly dedicate their owne we deuise a thousand euill shifts to hooke and catch that which other haue bestowed they laid downe theirs at the apostles feete we take from thence that which is giuen to god there men sold their possessions to giue to godly vses here wee buy and purchase all we can then euerie one gaue somewhat to the church and the poore now men are so inhumane that they enuie

the poore the commonest things of this life the very elements of nature this must shame vs and teach vs another lesson so caluin

last of all that famous man of worthie memorie

william perkins whom may terme in some sort the father of the prophets or at lest a learned man that finished that worke of his but out of his notes as take it complaineth in this manner we may hence collect saith he the great want of deuotion in the most men of these dayes for as the of the poore in the streetes is an argument of the lacke of mercie among vs so the number of the needie and wandering leuites which offer themselues to serue for a morsell of bread and a sute of apparell is a pregnant proofe there is no deuotion for the maintenance of religion especially in those that are so straight laced in bestowing any thing for the good of gods ministers and yet in keeping of hounds and hawks and worse matters players and iesters yea fooles and flatterers are lauish and profuse
this hath bin the practise of the world and the condition of the ministers in all times
false prophets were well and plentifully prouided for at iezabels table when the true prophets of god in the meane time were driuen to hide their heads hauing scarce bread and water to liue vpon and that also not without danger of their liues her practise shall condemne a number of our professours nay our forefathers zeale and forwardnes notwithstanding their great blindnes shal condemne our coldnes in this behalfe
the very stones and rubbish of the ruined abbies

aud other religious houses shall rise vp against vs for they maintained
or
idle bellies most of them which did nothing but nuzzle them in idolatrie and ignorance where now the same place will not mainetaine one competent preacher to instruct their soules vnto saluation for we take from the church faster then they gaue it

in the old time the saying was what shal we bring to the seer or man of god but now the wicked say come let vs take the houses of god for our possessions
the iewes were euen prodigall in their contributions to the tabernacle offring more then enough so as they needed to be inhibited with the sound of the drumme and proclamation as our forefathers also were by the statute of mortmaine this lauish giuing to the materiall temple shall rise vp in iudgement against our little giuing to the spirituall ministrie the liuing temple of god nay our taking away from it being far better then the leuiticall priesthood for looke by how much god hath diminished the cost of the altar and the charge of the ceremonious worship of the old testament so much more liberally doth he looke to haue the ministerie maintained and the spirituall worship furthered in the new
lastly if they that helpe not to vphold the ministerie shall be condemned what shall become of them that rob the church of her reuenewes and deuoure the holy things and thus much of that matter

chap
iii
a disswasiue to all men not to meddle with things deuoted

now here desire all men to consider how preiudiciall it is vnto the gospel how dishonourable to god iniurious to his seruitours ignominious to our countrie and dispendious to our owne saluation to beggar and distresse those that for their worke sake should be had in high esteeme and worthy reputation
if a man should by couenant and oath binde himselfe vnto the deuill to doe his endeauour and faithfullest seruice in oppugning and ruining the kingdome of christ he could neuer deuise to attempt it more directly then by driuing compelling the ministers of god to such straights and difficulties that wanting conuenient maintenance they must be forced to giue ouer that function or neuer vndertake it flying to rome or rhemes or amsterdam for more liberall allowance and meanes of maintenance or if not so betake himselfe to some base and illiberall trade for better supportation or last of all as bad as any to persist in the calling without incouragement or comfort exercising the same neither with profit to other not with content to themselues so that neither themselues can doe any good in it and other are kept off from it as not being to buy miserie and contempt at so high a rate
now what

is this but a part of that persecution which iulian sometime raised against the church by depriuing the clergie of their preferments the ministers of their maintenance and the preachers of their salaries by which meanes he did more hurt to christianitie in one yeare then many of his predecessours had done by seeking their blood in many for as one hath obserued he did tollere presbyteriu but they presbyteros so doe they that by any coloured forgerie or professed impietie doe wrest or detaine from the clergie their iust inheritance they plucke the sunne out of the firmament bring into the church depriue gods people of instruction themselues of saluation

therefore in this one peice of seruice god seemes to haue placed life and death blessing and cursing that in the kinde and conscionable vsage of the men and matters of god this in the wronging and sadding of them

consider some passages of holy scripture to this effect the prophet repeating some iudgements of god to the people speaketh thus will come neere to

you to iudgement and will be a swift witnes against the soothsaier the false swearer the adulterer and those that wrongfully keep backe the hirelings wages and vexe the widow the fatherles and the stranger and feare not me saith the lord of hosts now what this defrauding is

and who be those labourers is seene in that which followeth
will a man spoile his gods yet you haue spoiled me and say wherein haue we spoiled thee in tithes and offrings ye are cursed with a curse for ye haue spoiled

me euen this whole nation
bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prooue me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if will not open the windowes of heauen vnto you and power you out a blessing without measure
and will rebuke the deuourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground neither shall your vine be barren in the field saith the lord of hosts

the like hath salomon honour the lord with thy riches and the first fruit of all thine encrease so shall thy barnes be filled with abundance and thy presses shall burst

with new wine
and salomons imitator who so keepeth the law bringeth offrings enough and thou shalt not appeare emptie before the lord for all these things are done because of the commaundement the offring of the righteous maketh the altar fat and the smell thereof is sweet before the most high

giue the lord his honour with a good and liberall eye and diminish not the first fruit of thy hands in all thy gifts shew a ioyfull countenance and dedicate thy tithes with gladnes giue vnto the most high according as he hath inriched thee and looke what thy hand is able giue with a cheerfull eye for the lord recompenceth and will giue thee seuen times as much
now by the way to explicate this the learned haue obserued that the iewes did first pay their first fruits secondly thereuma or leuatio and thirdly a twofold tyth the greater the lesse
now the thereuma might not be lesse then the fourth fift or sixt part and these they called of a good eie an indifferent an euil eie

the tythe againe hierom writes was of fowre sorts the to the leuite the
from the leuite to

the priest the to the lord at hierusalem the to the poore euery third yeere which beeing not perceiued of some reuerend men of late times bred in them this errour that tithes are iudaicall because they were to goe to the poore once in three yeares which was but one kinde of tithes not the whole genus of them as this father hath shewed
this for the good and euill eie which syracides so beateth vpon

augustine doth mightily inforce this matter deus qui totum dare dignatus est decimam dignatus est accipere non sibi sed nobis profuturam he that vouchsafeth to giue vs all we haue is pleased yet to keep the tenth himselfe not for his profit but for ours homines stulti quid mali imperat deus vt non mercatur audiri foolish men what hurt is there in his demand that he should not be thought worthy to bee heard thou doest not giue it but shalt receiue it again with aduantage
sith then by paying thy tithes thou gainest both heauenly and earthly blessings why doest thou in thine owne light by thy niggarddize and follie heare you this you prophane worldlings all that you haue is his and will you not let him haue his owne hee askes no gift at thy hand but that which may bee for thy good he begs no almes but askes his honour the tythes and first fruits are not thine but his yet thou holdest them from him
what wouldst thou doe if he should giue thee but one of tenne and retaine the to himselfe as he doth by restraining the blessed showres so that thy haruest is starued with drowt or nipped with

frost quidigitur auidè supputas ideo tibi nouem partes detractae sunt quia tu decimam dare noluisti why doest thou cast thy reckoning on thy fingers ends thou loosest
parts for denying the tenth haec est enim dei iustissima consuetudo si tu decimam dare nolueris tu ad decimam reuoceris so god vseth to deale with them that denie him his tenth to leaue him nothing but the tenth to liue on dabis impio militi quod non vis dare sacerdoti thou shalt giue to the extortioner which thou wilt not giue to thy minister
this and much more augustine in the same place

and againe in an other place bringing in a man pleading his charge of children he saith thus quam curam agis filiorum vt eos obruas lachrymis miserorum nolo sic prouideas vt magis inuideas sic enim salomon qui congregat aliena relinquit filio dolorem what care is this thou takest for thy children to ouerthrow them with the teares of poore men would not haue thee so prouide for them that thou shouldst rather seeme to enuie them for salomon saies he that gathereth other mens goods leaues nothing but griefe vnto his child
it was said by christ giue to caesar that which is caesars giue to god that which is gods for therfore our ancestors abounded in all wealth because they paid their tithes to god and their tributes to caesar

in all which regards the iewes who of all the world were both the most bountifull and the most true tithers of all their goods called that action diuitiarum saepem the fence of all their fortunes and to that purpose haue to this day a prouerbe amongst them decima vt diues fias the onely way to thriue

well is to tythe well
for which cause the canonists also make it a ruled case that a man not thriuing vpon his liuing if he be such as hath been noted backward in payment of church duties his is not bound in equitie to abate his rent because it is to be presumed that his pouertie is from the hand of god to punish his ill dealing that way
which opinion doth reside yet in the iewes to this day and some elder christians who are scrupulous or rather almost superstitious in this matter who paying their duties iustly and fearing to possesse any of the churches demeanes most conscionably will rise vp in iudgement against many of vs of righter religion and deeper learning which part of gods feare beeing raced out of many of our hearts makes vs to defile our hands with holy pillage and secretly drawe downe the iudgements of god vpon our selues and our successors without any knowledge or ar least acknowledgement of the true cause as achan that troubled both his owne house and all israel by such vngratefull iniurie and iniurious ingratitude to god and his church

heard it once in some earnest lamented that the goodly copes rich accoustrements of the church haue been a long time sicke of a consumption and kept their chamber and as it were sometimes to take aire would looke out at the windowes like prisoners at a grate as bewailing their long and vndeserued durance whereunto one more merily then bitterly did strait reply that it was no maruell for fooles did first bring them in and knaues had againe

carried them out
censure not the sarcasme but thinke they were not so foolish that endowed the church with such as then seemed superfluous ornaments as they faultie that with them haue bereft the church of her necessarie habiliments

olim orbis ingemuit videns se factum arrianum hodie ingemiscit videns se factum atheum the time was once that the world wailed to see her selfe so suddenly turned arrian now shee hath cause to crie to see her selfe turned atheist
that which our sauiour said was onely necessarie we hold the onely vnnecessarie but god forbid that these should bee the blossomes of our religion to rob god of his honour his church of her reuenewes our soules of selfecomforts and heauen of her inhabitants
yet this is not the worst for when we complaine vs of our greiuance we are scoffed at with iulians sarcasmes who when the christians craued redresse of their wrongs would answer them your master bad you vse patience that when one tooke your cloake you should giue him your coate also so are we preached vnto
blasphemie to insult on our sufferings impiety to trample on our miserie must we be silent while you are sacrilegious must we be patient while you are impudent god graunt it be not said of this sinne as was of the like that caused his sacrifices

to be blasphemed the lord hath sworn to the house of eli that the sinne of the house of eli shall not be purged with sacrifice nor oblation for euer

the world at this day findes much fault with the of ministers facile est inuenire

ad caedendum canem howbeit wil not excuse it altogether yet this speake of knowledge that the cruell incroachments of many parrishioners enforce some men to be against their wils beeing so daily vexed with the abuses in this kind that they are enforced to a hard choice to liue among them with daily molestations or to seeke any weake stay to liue from them for their ease to giue way to their neighbours importunate compilations singing to themselues that comfortlesse carroll

sic ego nec sine te nec tecum viuere possum

speake not this in hope to doe any good yet god knows feare the euil is cureles the maladie remediles not because there is no balme in gilead or physitian there but for that when they would haue healed babylon she would not be healed yet must speake it if not ad correctionem yet at least ad conuictionem we shall shortly bring things to that passe as sometimes tully spake of the commonwealth not to make it the question qualem ecclesiam sumus habituri sed an habituri sumus vllam not what church we shall haue but whether we shall haue a church or no nec iam de terminis sed de totapossessione erit contentio the sute will not be about the but the very lands
we are alreadie come to fimbrias quarrell to bite and whine to stab and complaine that the dagger went in but halfe way we are driuen to craue some small pittances of our owne possessions and cannot bee heard or if we be we are braued with bountie and vpbraided with benefits they may indeed bee benefitia but as tullie calls them latronum theeues benefits

to whom we are therfore beholden that they do not kill vs when they rob vs most of the lands and mannors of old erection are beg'd for fooles a fewe prelacies remaine though not vnpluckt yet not wholly deuoured some dignities and ecclesiastical liuings haue escaped the common wracke yet narrowly lookt into and vigilantly viewed to be scored vp for the next seazure men beeing and officious to light candles and sweepe corners as a reuerend prelate not long since complained not to finde and restore the lost
pence but to search and seeke the left pennie

but let them beware it prooue not too hotte for their handling like the monie of delphos or the gold of tholose which so many as touched came to disaster destinies
gods part hath euer been like gods arke which so long as it was in the hands of vncircumcised philistims neuer left plaguing them with sundrie vengeances till the heifers brought it home againe to the true possessours like eagles feathers that consume and canker all other among whom they are mingled like the flesh of the altar wherein a coale was couched which burnt the neast

it hath bin obserued by the verie heathen that neuer any barbarian or of the commo sort of naturalists did denie god or his power or durst offer to their dieties any of those prodigions indignities that we read of onely the fine witted fellowes the grecians whose learning indeed had made them mad were the first if not the onely that did it euemerus messenius hippo diagoras epicurus dionysius who plaid his prizes with all his gods one after another shauing the golden berd away of god aesculapius because forsooth his father apollo wore no berd dimasntling god apollo of his robe of gold and giuing him another of because the gold was too heauie for summer too cold for winter not onely robbing but deriding whatsoeuer to them was holy

but most memorable was the fact fortune of cyrus who brake vp in babylon the tomb of semiramis inuited thereunto by an inscription vpon the same in hope of much treasure which sounded to this effect what king soeuer shall want mony if he dig downe this graue shall find sufficient
now this tombe had thus stood many yeeres inuiolate till at last cyrus comming hither and reading the writing he fell to spoile the sacred monument but hauing spent much paines to little purpose still frustrate of his hope all last vpon a stone he encountered another writing to this purpose surely hadst thou not bin a very insatiable wretch thou wouldst haue neuer violated the temples of the gods nor ransacked the graues of the dead to fill thy greedy desire but goe thy way ere long thou shalt finde enough and so indeed he did for he was caught in the ambushes that queene tamaris had laid for him beheaded and cast into a but of blood with that bitter exprobration satiate sanguine quem sitisti

the like disaster had xerxes for breaking vp the temple and sepulchre of belus in hope of gold where hee was disapointed of his hopes but found something which he would not a viol halfe full of oyle wherin were the ashes of that old king and a annexed containing this scripture whosoeuer shall break vp this monument and not fill vp this viol with oile

let him rest assured there remaines for him very heauy fortunes whereupon he attempting to fill it found it a thing impossible the glasse either by magicke or miracle neuer admitting repletion whereupon in despaire he gaue it ouer expecting the portended mischeifes so threatened vnto him which fell out in fine accordingly for warring against the grecians he receiued an irrecouerable discomfiture wherein he lost at the hands of a handfull of men myriads of followers and running away most basely and dishonourably was put to death by the hands of his owne children

an other example most remarkeable in humane stories is of one macareus a priest at mytelene who first robbed then killed a man in his vestry that had entrusted him with some treasure this mystes shortly after solemnizing the trietericall rites of that region and religion as he was busie in the midst of his ceremonies surrounding the citie new gone out of the temple where hee had left the fire requisite for his sacrifices his two young children who had obserued their fathers fashions fell to imitate his sacrifice and one with the blade which was vsed in the seruice playing the priest killed his brother in stead of a beast as he had seene formerly performed the mother in her house neere adioyning to the temple at the noise of the cry came hastily in and seeing what was done in great rage snatching a brand that lay on the fire stroke the suruiuer dead in the place these sorrowfull accidents soone beeing spred all ouer the city came to the cares of the father who was still in

his pageant and idolatrous pompe but soon leauing his seruice he ran to the place and finding his wife bewailing her fact with the torch he yet held in his hand the vnhappy instrument of his holy deuotions he killed her at his foot for which himselfe was instantly apprehended tortured examined where betweene the terrors of torment and horrors of conscience he confessed the whole matter from the beginning to the ende for which he presently receiued condigne punishment beeing put to death to make vp the tragedie

but come we neerer home vnto our selues for as much as farre fet examples haue but far off respects and it seemes to concerne vs little what was done so farre from home
will looke no higher then the conquest where we shall finde earle godwin earle of kent father to harold whom the norman ouerthrew how treacherously how impiously did he inuest himselfe with holy possessions first by captious sophystrie cosening the archbishop of canterbury for his mannor of boseham in sussex with this deuise putting a tricke vpon him he had instructed his followers what he would doe and bad them be readie to beare witnesse what the archbishop answered to his subtile sophisme and then he requests my lord to let him haue his boseam the good bishop thinking he had asked his blessing little minding his mannor made answer my lord giue you my boseam and so he wrangled the good man out of his land ouerbearing him with the testimonie of his treacherous attendants

many other like exploits did that man but in the ende himselfe at the kings table was choaked with a peice of bread according to his imprecation and we know what befell his sonne and the whole land not onely slaine with most part of the auncient nobilitie of this land but the scepter translated to a forraine prince
say no more

the next is the same forraine prince himselfe william the norman surnamed the conquerour who vsing his victorie verie hardly beside other things to make his new forrest dispeopled no small compasse of ground
parishes with their townes and churches of whom a bishop of winchester made those verses

templa adimit diuis fora ciuibus arua colonis
but what befell him to say nothing of his owne discomforts vpon his death bed his sonne and successor surnamed rufus in his hunting in the same forrest rex cervum insequitur the same poet as fast as he pursues his game vengeance pursueth him he was by chance shot through by sir walter tyrrel
his next sonne richard died of the plague his eldest sonne robert after many mischiefs and miseries done and suffered had his eies put out by his owne brother and died most miserably in durance and prison and henry his nephew by robert

in the same forrest also came to absaloms ende beeing hanged in a tree as he chased his deere
so sacriledge ends for the most part with extirpation as hath been noted

the last will name not the least in this catalogue shall be voisie bishop of this citie of excester who from a pettie canon in the church rose to the bishops mytre but there sell to that wicked resolution that the wicked nero somtime had done undefined span alphabet when die care not though all the world die with me for this high priest forgetting that euer he had been clarke or not caring whether there should be any after like politicians newly risen pluckt vp the ladder after him that no more should ascend for of
goodly mannors that belonged to the sea he made so good riddance that he scarce reserued one for them that should follow this bishop at one time relating vnto steuen gardiner then bishop of winchester what prouision hee had made in the church for his graue receiued this answer my lord what talke you of a church a dunghill is fitter for your deserts then a church which haue so shamefully mangled that goodly sea you haue plaied the beast and deserue no better place then a beast so haue heard indeed was serued
but this haue been verie credibly informed of that with his holy pillage hee purchased many priuiledges to his natiue soile of sutton colfield in warwickeshire and inriched many of his kinred which now they are but little the better for many of them or as they say the most hauing bin weeded out by dishonourable ends

these haue been the successes of sacriledgers for the most part god hauing set a marke vpon them as he did vpon cain· that all the world may take notice of them and as dauid saith that the righteous may reioyce

when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the vngodly and men shall say verily there is fruit for the sacrilegious doubtles there is a god that iudgeth the earth

will end this chapter with an example of another kinde that is of mercie for the rarenes of it and that

of dagobertus a king of france who newly comming to his crowne liued a most dissolute and deboshed life a long time yet in the end by a great and gracious visitation sent from god he had a faire comming off againe as had euer any
this man first maried two wiues at once besides mistresses sans some whereof he carried about with him whersoeuer he went other he maintained very sumptuously as queens in many places of the kingdome it is not possible to comprise the lest part of his lewdnes in any mediocritie of words which when his bishop amandus reprooued him for he very vniustly sent him into banishment whom hee had no sooner rid his hands of but he fell to fowler matters robbing of churches and pulling downe religious houses and turning out the ecclesiasticall persons into the open world to take aire
at length when god saw his good time he sent a very heauie visitation vpon him finde not what was the particular that thorough the good grace of god wrought so holy and wholesome contrition in him that he

vowed to god if he did recouer to make some amends which he faithfully performed according to the deuotion of those times erecting churches building colledges founding monasteries alwaies and openly confessing that the iudgements of god had been sent vnto him principally for his outrages commited that way

among other monuments of his repentance and humiliation he founded the monasterie of wissenburg in germanie where he left for a monument of his true conuersion a confession penned with his owne hand to this effect in what manner almightie god hath plagued and restored me againe haue thought good to publish by these presents to all the world to the end that all men may take notice of my fall and folly and likewise of my restauration restitution but cheifly that so many as shall heare of my doings may be afraid to make hauocke of gods holy temples and learne to performe such reuerence thereto as best beseemeth

be it therefore knowne that after my father lotharius was dead tooke vpon me as next heire the gouernement of the kingdome but being transported with errors and lightnes of youth neglected the duty of a good prince discharging neither iustice nor conscience but as was carried by humour and fauour
among many other my excesses became a ruiner of gods inheritance and a demolisher of his worship which ought to haue set vp and maintained till at last that god in mercie to chasten my rebellion

did dash my pride and cast me downe and when he had brused me sufficiently he receiued me againe to mercie and this confession leaue against my selfe here in record that none may dare in like presumption to violate this holy place at this present by me deuoted to god
thus far dagobert which haue set downe the more fully because there are so few examples of reuersion in this kinde as it is in the fable of the fox replying to the lyon for not visiting him

an humble obtestation to the hon and wor
knights and burgesses of the parliaament when time may serue to remedie this mischeife

and now most worthie patriots let me addresse my speech to you that manage the greatest affaires of this kingdome and that not by way of oneration but most lowly summission may it please you seriously to consider this matter with me and see wherein your seruice may be honourable to god· glorious to your selues comfortable to the church and profitable to your countrie
it is no new thing for vs to complaine or for you to heare of the mischeifes of for sacriledge

woe is me that am growne so vnfauourie to be hated so vgly to be abhorred so barren to be reiected so decrepite to be scorned and that of mine owne cradle
is a become so louely or an empty house so handsome that am driuen away for an other to haue my roome alas

my sonnes will say what see the lickerish looke after my poore estate shewes too great to your greedie eies the deceitfull lustre of a painted beautie bewitcheth your lasciuious eies as you thinke to enioy as know to indure her glorious beautie in glorious tyrannie who if she comes in will not onely fetch backe all that was mine but also fetch in all that is yours
remember this but whom you dishonour and whom you please did not the enemie triumph inough before while you vnripped the seamlesse coat but you must yeeld them more content by distressing me their hatefull opposite what meane you to doe remember but to whom you do it and doe your will to one that vpholdeth the scepter maintaineth you secureth all you haue they are my seruitours that stead you my priests that blesse you my ministers that profit you who cause your god to be obeyed your gouernours honoured your people informed your country renowmed and your happinesse continued

if the church the mother of vs all could be heard or vnderstood thus to speake and thus to plead what could ye answear what apologie would you make or excuse pretend to her as affectionate as iust complaint but now not onely shee but am well assured god himselfe in the greiuances of his ministers doth say the same with a more audible voice more reall effect that god say whose houses ye haue suffered not to be robbed onely but ruined also

his reuenews diminished his churches demolished his donations alienated his holy things vsurped his portions interuerted and his worship dishallowed

all the world till late daies thought the church the safest sanctuarie to repose their treasures in their wealth their good works but now the poorest cottage is farre safer then the strongest cathedrall
then it was thought as great an immunity to the deponent as honestie and honor to the recipient now the orphan is iniured the widow wronged the father discouraged the sanctuarie prophaned and the

priest of all other auoided
read what time the citie of ephesus was beleaguered with a long and dangerous seige and the inhabitants with doubts of warre daunted the gouernour gaue this aduise to tie the walls and gates of the citie with ropes and cables to the temple of their goddesse to the ende that when all they had were so peculiarly surrendred vnto their deities patronage it should not onely be impious but sacrilegious to the enemie to attempt that which was now sacred
oh what is become of auncient holines that haue now inuerted the method of true security when we do not annexe our chests to churches but incorporate the holiest of churches to our priuate chests and patrimonies

iustinian the second hauing a great desire to plucke downe a church in the citie of constantinople that stood in his light fast ioyning to the pallace that in the roome thereof he might erect a tarras for the people to see and receiue the emperour intreated

callimacus then patriarke to perswade the people that it was neither displeasing to god nor offensiue to any to conuert churches to other vses as those had done that had ouerthrowne the heathen temples and disposed of them otherwise
to whom the holy archbishop made this replie sir god forbid that euer should vse my tongue in perswading men to pull downe churches who haue neede to incite them all can to build more
true it is this request and this repulse prooued fatall to both for the emperour bearing splene to the patriarke for this the patriark ioyned with leontius to depose iustinian and iustinian after much hurly burly recouering the diademe first blinded then banished the patriark
it is too wel known with what animositie ambrose resisted theodosius in like case which elswhere remembring he vseth these words meministis ipsi

quoties aduersus regales impetus pro viduarum imò omnium depositis certamen subierimus you remember how often haue been put to my plunges in the behalfe of the churches the common banke of the widowes and all the word against the great assaults and impetitions of the emperour
the like he recordeth of another whom he calleth episcopus vicinensis
oh that there were the like spirit in our moderne bishops in your honorable senators that when any sacrilegious bill or mercenarie tongue shal rise vp to perswade to like dishonourable courses he may by your learned speaker or religious members be quashed silenced committed
howeuer you shall please to humour any in like sute may it please you out of

the greatnes of your place and seriousnes of your imployments to consider your priuate estates your houses honour your empires glorie your sauiours worship nequid ecclesia detrimenti capiat for further perswasion hereof vouchsafe to heare this wholesome aduise which though for the author ye are to repudiate yet because it is an oracle not to calumniate

what time camillus was banished to capua and the french vnder bremus were possessed of rome clarius the consull was sent by the senate to apollo delphicus to demaund counsell what they might doe where he remained
daies together in humble supplication before the shrine without once being heard or vouchsafed answeare and so after
weekes expence of time and losse of much treasure he returned as he came then the senate thought it good to send the priests out of euery temple in rome two who ariuing there were presently answeared in this manner maruell not yee romanes that haue thus long refused to answeare for foolish people vse neuer to seeke to god till men doe saile them but therefore doth god refuse to counsell such in their extremitie because they neuer come at them but in extremitie
take this of me neuer leaue god to flie to men for it more auaileth to hold league with god then loue with all the men aliue be warie how you offend god for he can damage you more then men can doe god forgets not men except he be much and oft forgot of them and therefore suffereth he them to persecute one another

because they all ioyne to persecute him or his if then if you will looke to haue him fauourable to you in time of warre you must be sure to serue him in the time of peace and know this that extreame chastisements are for extreame sinnes
these are the mementoes send to the romans and as to clarius vouchsafed to make no answer to so euill a messenger for take this from me and if you find my counsell ill then take no more in forren ambassages send alwaeis your most eloquent orators in senate at home put alwaies the wisest men your wars abroad commit alwaies to the most valiant commanders and in the negotiations of god put alwaies the most innocent priests for god will neuer appease his iust ire against vniust actions but if your solicitours be most holy and righteous
as for the french they cannot be driuen from rome till camillus and all the guiltlesse citizens that are now in banishment are recalled home these wars doe but warne you of your offences past for looke what euil wicked men doe to the good in diuerse dayes by other as euill they shall be sure to bee repaid in one

this was the answer which apollo gaue the flamines that were sent vnto him an answer to say no more that might haue befitted a farre better author but it is not speaking but doing that saues wherein we haue the start of the wisest atheist or deuil in the world
consider beseech you of the matter and apply it if you please

to conclude as they recommended all their state to the wisedome and prouidence of their senate so

doe wee the poore and despised ministers of this kingdome in the behalfe of the church recommend the care of god and his gospel to your wisedoms and deuotions our consuls and senators not as finding defect in your diligence but as he

qui monet vt facias quod iam facis ipse monendo

consolation to my reuerend fathers and brethren of the clergie against the iniuries of the times

my honoured lords reuerend brethen and beloued in the gospel of god considering the daily and dangerous in iustice which the world doth practise vpo the church need not tell you that the same doth concerne all you that are the deputies of god in this case as from god to men in matters of grace and internall benediction so of men to god for temporall tribute and thankefull retaliation
if then we finde our charges ingrate our superiours sinistrous our neighbours iniurious our auditors sacrilegious not respecting our labours nor requiting our cares neither reuerencing our persons nor abstaining from our pensions

what remaines for vs to be done but to descend into our selues and examine our consciences in the sight of god and his holy angels whether it be the guerdon of our sinnes or the gaging of our graces which he lookes should be reall and eminent in vs
and albeit we must truely agnize that such vsages are the portion of our cup and the inheritance of our profession which our master hath left vnto vs yet it cannot be denied but we shall finde sufficient cause within our selues to ascribe the same to our deserts and aberrations

it is written in the late histories of the indian people that if they finde in their temples and sacraries of their superstitions any horrid or abhorred creatures as owles or backs or toads or serpents which men account as hatefull and ominous they dispose themselues to all the shewes of humilitie that their holiest ceremonies can declare to expiate the anger of their displeased zemes and furious deities which they hold presaged by such impurities
the like take it are we to doe and make collection of these vnclean vermine in the sanctuaries of god that god is most highly offended with vs and that these impure monsters and prodigious harpies doe really prognosticate the threats of heauen as to the whole land in generall so to vs of the holy ministerie in particular whose the temple is and the signes portended there more peculiar appropriate to our calling

wherefore we shall doe well to search and diue into the true reason and howsoeuer their creeping

in or sculking vnder some groundsell or threshold makes them nothing the holier but helps their damnation as desperate hypocrites yet the desert is from our selues so that as we denounce his iudgements to them so are we to descrie his iustice to vs so to suffer vs to loose our reuerence and rights that are fallen away from his feare honouring our selues more then his sonne more respecting our riches then our religion and more caring for gold then wee doe for god

beseech you then right reuerend and renowned fathers and brethren giue me leaue with a light finger if not to lance this sore yet not blanch the search for take it it is no dead flesh that needs any boisterous rifling but tender and sensible to iudure the ransacking nec vt verenda retegam sed vt in verecunda confutem as sweet bernard rather with sem to awake your drowsinesse then with cham to display your nakednesse

first then feare it may by some be thought that your ambition my honoured lords hath excited these harpies of state whereby you haue laid open your chests to their rauening hands and your churches to their irreligious hearts
or it may bee you the canons and prebends of the greater churches that are either couetous or vmbratilous or polypragmonous or you my brethren and fellows in the countrie partly schismatical partly symoniacal men seditious or scandalous more frequenting the palace then the pulpit and more soliciting the hall with sutes then heauen with saints that haue opened the

mouthes of these cursing shemeis and rayling and strengthened the hand of sacrilegious achans and irreligious atheists
or it may bee as euerie one seuerally so all combinedly haue sinned and committed something preiudiciously to our persons and patrimonies as for example

when a symonizing scholler agrees with a gehezying patron and a iudaizing bishop to make a diabolizing impropriation or as malmburiensis writeth of one halfe bishop of norwich when there meetes in one indiuiduall a scholler a courtier a flatterer a symoniake a bishop and a pirat
howeuer it be would to god that our symonie and policie and idlenes and couetousnesse and absence and silence and basenesse and businesse which hath drawne this miserie vpon vs with cords and this mischeife with were sifted and expiated as it ought that god might see our humiliation and the world our satisfaction

therefore we must take this as gods most iust retaliation forasmuch as we haue let goe those greater points of holinesse mercie iustice faith and faithfulnesse it is but meete that wee should loose these diminitiues of mint and anise and commin because we giue not god his due other giue not ours to vs this beeing the condition of our obligation that they shall be honoured that honour him and they

but little esteemed that despise him and this is that which augustine saith our inferiours both men and members derie vs that obedience which we detaine in our places from god

the historie of the renowned bishop amphilochius bishop of iconium is well enough known and the stratageme he vsed to the emperour theodosius to shew him his error in the matter of the arrians
the holy bishop had solicited this emperour to expell the heretikes that had as then too much fauour in the empire as some of their fellowes haue at this day with vs but the emperour out of his mildenes had forborne to doe it as some other doe also now so as by this conniuence they had almost mard all· whereupon the good bishop was driuen to bethinke himselfe of some remedie to awake the emperour out of his dead sleepe for which cause hauing within a while occasion to come to the court to visit his highnesse he found the young emperour arcadius whom his father had newly created to gouern with him sitting in state together with the olde emperour
the good bishop made humble reuerence to the emperour theodosius but to arcadius did none at all
the olde emperour thinking he had done it by ouersight put him in minde to salute arcadius also the bishop replied it sufficed to honour him and therefore needed not reuerence his sonne also
the emperour now growing into choller at so high contempt bad he should be carried out of the court whereupon the bishop taking the opportunity told the emperour to this effect and doe you sir emperour take the dishonour of your sonne so hainously then beseech you consider how god wil take it at your hands to dishonour his sonne
the emperour pawsing somewhat vpon his speech and

waighing the iustnesse of the reproofe acknowledged his errour and presently tooke order to auoide the arrians out of the empire

therefore who knowes whether god hath bid shemei curse dauid or sends senacherib to spoile ierusalem for as achior speakes vnto the great commander if there be error in this people or that they haue

sinned against their god then maiest thou goe vp and ouercome them and as zeres speakes if wee haue begun

to fall before them it is to be feared we shall fall more for they are iewes but if we shall repent vs of our sinnes and resume our first loue who knowes if he will returns

and leaue a blessing behind him a meat offring and drinke offering to the lord our god therefore let the priests and the ministers of the lord weep betweene the porch and the altar and say spare thy people lord and giue not thine inheritance a reproach that the heathen may rule ouer vs so shall the lord be iealous ouer his people and restore the yeeres that the locust hath eaten the canker the caterpillar and the euen the strong host which he sendeth among vs

but in case for all this that god shall thinke good to verefie that on vs which was said of christ by iohn me oportet minui illum autem crescere yet let vs shew the world our christian patience and holy confidence against their furie and falshood that we serue not god for meed as they obiect but in the midst of malice in the midst of penurie in the midst of infamie we will follow our leader without forsaking our calling malus est miles qui imperatorem gemens sequitur he is but that followes

armes but in faire weather

the world hath been perswaded feare me too truly of too many that schollers flie to the ministerie as malefactors doe to the sanctuarie for sinister and oblique respects for imunitie or impunitie for ease or honour as many of them that haue had either foolish or deformed needie or vnthrifty children such they set aside to weare the ephod and other doe gladly recount how their ruined estates and forlorne hopes haue been wholly supported by the pillars of the church which otherwise had sunke in euerlasting vndoing so making the church their vltimum refugium the of their fortune and the bawd of their bankruptnes
thus measuring others feete by their owne last presume the same of our diuersions now let them by our carriage be confuted and giuen to know we had no cynosura but sion no collimation but conscience no aime but gods honour
and that if god shall please not onelie to touch vs but to take all the rest from vs and giue satan sufferance not onely to winnow but to wast vs yet we will be the same and serue him still this may be our comfort that god dealeth no worse with vs this our hope he meanes no more harme vnto vs this our harbinger that he may call vs to a harder triall

for haue we any assurance to fare better then our fathers any priuiledge of to sit safer then our brethren we haue not yet resisted vnto blood perhaps we must therefore let vs not loue these things too much lest we leaue better things

for them· let this weane vs from the world and teach vnto serue god in all weather

as for our enemies and ouerthwart neighbours let them not triumph in our tribulations the fate of babel comes in next after the fall of sion now the time is that iudgement must begin at gods owne house

and if it first begin at vs what shall the ende of them be that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous be scarcely saued where shall the vngodly and sinner appeare wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their soules to him in as vnto a faithfull creator for this is gods vse when he hath beaten his children sufficiently he will cast the rod in the fire and the apostle saies it is a manifest

token of the righteous iudgemen of god that ye may be accounted worthie of the kingdome of god for which also ye suffer seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you and to you that are troubled rest with vs when the lord iesus shallbe reuealed from heauen with his mightie angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and obey not the gospel of our lord iesus christ who shallbe punished with euerlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and the glorie of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired of all that beleeue in that day

the conclusion where are touched the fountaine and remedies of all this euill

and now feele my pen wearie with the chace of this noysome beast will sound a retrait and draw to end so oft as enter into the serious consideration of this sinne and the great inconueniences that it hath and daily will deriue vnto the church of god in this land as often doe cannot but thinke of that word of abner vpon the play of the

young men shall the sword deuoure sor euer knowest thou not it will be bitternes in the latter end for seeing the dead sea into which things must needs descend in the farthest fall is nothing but atheisme and all manner of impietie let vs a little looke vpward vnto the head and search whether it may be stopt in the spring or diuerted some other way

the true cause then of all this ramping and reuelling against god and his holy church is first profanes and seconly couetousnesse a verie contempt of heauen and all true happines and a greedy desire to inglutte our selues with esaus pottage the commodities and emoluments of this present life

for the first if euer this land fall backe againe by a fearfull recidiuation into the carnall impieties and earthly sensualities of the romish religion as it is in a faire forwardnes vnles god preuent it it will be by the meanes of our notorious atheisme and fearfull

apostasie from the true feare of god and care of all goodnes for these are at least subordinate one to another if not identities for they that will but looke into the manners of the moderne times shall well perceiue that many that had escaped the scylla of superstition are againe verie dangerously beleaguered in the caribdis of irreligion teaching their hearts with platoes atheist either that there is no god at all or that he is not such for mercie or iustice as men are made beleeue or at least that men may doe as in too manie spirituall courts buy out their heauie pennance with light commutements
to which purpose call to minde a strange narration of greenham a zealous preacher sometime of our church of a certaine instable sinner that at first had been a papist till ariuing at better reason he found their fashions to come much short of their gawdie shewes then turned he his tippet and became protestant where he staid not long by reason they shewed much coldnes in their profession at last he separated and was a
now whether it was he had not left himselfe any further choice or took a better tast of their religion there he fastened now the first principle that they sought to instill into him was this that there was no god
now whether it was the iust dereliction of god to punish his giddines or the fatigation of a wandring spirit to purchase quietnes or the correspondence of the maxime suting well with his wickednes he drunke in this position verie greedily and thereupon began to frame conclusions if there be no god then there

is no heauen nor hell to reward mens actions if neither of these what madnes is this to defraud my soule of certaine pleasures for vncertaine phantasies
this diabolicall collusion rather then conclusion so far preuailed with him that like some ignis fatuus it carried him headlong into all manner of licentious downefalls first for pleasure to eating and drinking like another euangelicall epicure then to mainetain that charge to robbing stealing and last of all as the reward of such courses to apprehending and hanging
now at the place of his death the point of the last gaspe he requested a stay where confessing his whole manner of life his wallowing in and out of all religions his beginning in papisme his continuing by protestisme and his ending in anabaptisme he deliuered these words now do find at my death the error of all my life was taught and did beleeue there was no god but here finde the contrary and that he is most iust to reward all wretched contemners and so he ended the catastrophe
question not the truth of this storie because knew the reporter will not scholie vpon his volubilous expatiation voluminous gradatio meritorious conclusion
let vs be afraid of these excentricall motions which the prophet calleth spiritum vertiginis a spirituall giddines whereby men wander in the labyrinths

of their owne leuities like pauls undefined span alphabet euer learning and neuer come to knowledge and

let vs follow the apostles cubical station continuing grounded and stablished in the faith not beeing mooued away from the hope of the gospel

for the remedie then of this peccant humour the counsell of the philosopher is not amisse to bend

the bough the contrarie way for diseases lightly are cured with their contraries as fulnes with fasting malice with mercie auarice with almes impietie or contempt of god with an awfull feare of his greatnesse a faithfull loue of his goodnesse for hee will be honoured either nobis or de nobis by religious adoration or dangerous direliction
therefore if we serue him he will serue vs but if wee shall cast off all his feare plucke downe his houses mangle his inheritance hinder his seruice discourage dishonour disanull his ministers and ministerie hoe will leaue vs to the counsell of our owne hands to make lust our law and might our moderator punishing impietie with incredulitie and incredulitie with complete miserie as he did our heathen auncestors whom he gaue vp into a reprobate minde to doe all

so doe riches for they that will be rich fall into tentations and snares and into many foolish and noysome lusts which drowne men in perdition and destruction for the loue of money is the root of all euill which while some haue lusted after they haue erred from the the faith and peirced themselues through with many sorrowes

take one example in stead of a comment vpon pauls text of mauritius the emperour adopted by tyberius the second to succeed in the empire hee at the beginning was an excellent and fortunate prince subduing and vanquishing the enemies of the empire with great applause and admiration as the armenians persians scythians lumbards and hunnes and many worthy exploits besides with much praise and commendation but in the end being mightily transported with filthy auarice he addicted himselfe to no other thing but scraping and hoarding of money and that by any fowle or base meanes whatsoeuer for beside other sordide and dishonourable

courses he fell to defraud his souldiers of their pay that serued in his warres in countries far off and weather verie grieuous by which courses hauing lost the hearts of his men of warre he receiued an exceeding great ouerthrowe whereby a mightie multitude of christians were taken prisoners of the barbarians for whose ransome hee would not part with one pennie albeit caianus offered their redemption singulos captiuos singulis nummis saith my author which nummus in gold was but in siluer a peece which rather then hee would part with he suffered the scythian to cut all their throates
now see what miserie befell this miser

there was a certaine religious man that in a propheticall spirit ran through the streetes of canstantinople halfe naked and mazed that in the hearing of all the citie that the emperour should die a most bloodie death whereupon the emperour hauing verie hardly escaped with his life in a tumult that rose in the towne comming to himselfe and revoluing in his minde his wretched courses and how many thousand christians hee had cast away by his horrible niggardize and barbarous parsimonie hee fell to great repentance crauing with all earnestnes at the hands of god all the vengeance that this life is capable of so that he might be spared euerlasting torments for which cause sending about his messengers and presents to all the churches through the empire and into the wildernesse and woods to the holy monks he desired to be recommended to

god in all their deuotions that he would be pleased to bee mercifull vnto him and to punish his sinnes here and not hereafter
now while in great humilitie he sued thus to god he had a diuination or vision sent him in his sleepe to this purpose hee seemed to be brought before the image of his sauiour which stood ouer the brasen gate of the pallace with an infinite of people round about him and he in the midst
then came a voice as it were from christ saying set me forth mauritius which beeing done the serieants and officers of the assize brought him to the barre where the iudge with his owne mouth said thus vnto him say mauricius where wilt thou haue me punish thee for thy euill life vpon the earth or else in hell to which question he presently answered vpon his knees most mercifull lord and iust auenger in this world with that the lord commaunded that he and constantina the empresse his sonnes and all his linnage should be committed ouer to phocas a souldier in the armie
now then so soone as hee awoke he sent with all speed for philippicus his sonne in lawe whom he had long had in iealousie as laying wait for his life and crowne and crauing pardon for his suspition he told him all his vision and demaunded who that phocas was who made him answer that he was a lieftenant in the army a deboshed young man and an arrant coward vpon which relation the emperour concluded that if he were such nothing would satisfie him but his blood
now for the further confirmation of this dreame a blazing starre appeared portending

the same euent
againe magistranus his ambassadour to the churches returned to the court that had solicited his cause to the monasteries and ministers abroad and from them all returned this answer that god had accepted of his repentance and was pleased to saue his soule but for his life and state the sentence would not be reuersed
all which things suting well together mauricius gaue most humble thankes to god committing all things to the heauenly prouidence and for the accomplishment of his fatall destinie rested patiently in hourely expectance
not long after the souldiers now lying in garrison know not whereupon rose in mutinie and crowned phocas so often mentioned to be emperour who presently addressing himselfe for constantinople and by sudden surprisall taking the citie through the negligence of the warders by the patriarke and all the people was soone confirmed some fewe excepted who because mauritius was yet liuing durst not assent which phocas had forgot so presently hee goes to the palace and searching for mauritius hee found him fled into a monasterie whence plucking him out and carrying out to calcydon they put him to cruell torments killing his wife and his fiue sonnes before his face during all whose death and his owne danger hee did nothing but pray with great deuotion euer repeating these words es domine recta iudiciatua righteous art thou lord true are thy iudgements and so most patiently commending his soule to god he tooke his death
thus farre the historie

by which wee note the truth of the scripture which calls riches deceitfull things for though they present as spake of the hawthorne a faire lustre to the eie and promise much happinesse to the heart yet they are like the apothecaries boxes which are written vpon cordials but are ranke poisons for although pouertie is the vndoing of many yet riches are the vndoing of farre more as one saith
wherefore our sauiour directing his speech to the rich

saies thus videte cauete ab auaritia see the effects beware the danger
the world thinks gold is good

for the eyes and so saith moses to make men blind and the blind saith christ are in danger to fall into the ditch therfore see and beware the eie must shew the feet must shun the danger that is double
for

this world temptations and snares and foolish and noysome lusts which drowne men in perdition and destruction
for the other whose god is their belly and glory their

shame minding earthly things their ende is damnation

as the anguish so is the antidote also double

contentation let your conuersation bee without couetousnesse and be content with that you haue
dependance on his prouidence he hath said will not faile thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper will not feare what man can do vnto me

let not any indent with god or craue a bill of his hand if had so much would trust to gods prouidence for the rest for we must simply surrender our selues vnto him
the readiest way to get the world is to sacrifice it vnto god as abraham did his sonne
salomon asked but wisdome and had

all other with it happie if hee had also asked grace but greedinesse is the portion of them that want godlinesse therefore the caribes and sauages set their heart vpon the earth because they haue no further hope in heauen
doth god care for oxen saith paul nothing like as he doth of his children why then should his children care for oxen or the earth more then for him but here is a brow and wall of brasse euer rebounding and euer resounding non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris which god amend and so ende

let god be glorified

this then is spoken undefined span alphabet as men seeme to sit still when they doe not succour their friends so doth god when he taketh not the defence of the church vpon himselfe

the note god so long seemes to defer his help while we stand as men amazed at our tribulation and looke not vp to him therefore if we would haue god to heare and help vs we must importune him with our praiers and peirce his eares with our cries
againe though god seemes to deferre his help to exercise our patience and increase our zeale and to let the wicked runne on till their sinnes be ripe yet that is but to set an edge to our deuotion and to punish their security the more seuerely

the note
the cause why the wicked are so inraged against the religion is this that sathan seekes with incessant malice to race it out and therefore exciteth his deboshed instruments to warre against it but their attempts are as friuolous as their intents barbarous by thinking to ouerthrow the counsel of god on which the perpetuitie of the church is grounded

persecution is not euer against the blood and life of gods saints but against the meanes of life the prouision of the profession and surely those neronian humours are lesse bloody then your iulian rancours who did noua more expugnare christianos deuise a new kinde of persecution by withdrawing their salaries and exhibitions

who haue said come let vs take the houses of god into our possessions here they declare themselues
note
let worldlings pretend what shewes they please they name deuotion but meane deuoration it is not the good of the church but the goods of the church that they seeke after

churches colledges and houses of old dedication are called gods not for his residing in temples made with hands in proper sence but because such places are dedicated to him consecrated to his seruice intended to his ministers as officinae religionis instrumenta pietatis deposita deuotionis

as good husbands esteemes their houses and patrimonies not suffring them to be ruined or wrested from them no more will god suffer his enemies to inuade his possessions or vsurpe his inheritance and therefore such things ought to be inuiolable and inappropriable to any other or any other end for which cause let them looke vpon them that haue done the like who they were how they fared where they miscaried they lined impiously died desperatly are remembred infamously foxes in their births woolues in their life asses in their death

my god make them as a wheele as the stubble before the winde as the fire that burneth the wood and as the flame setteth the mountaines on fire so persecute them with thy tempest and scare them with thy storme
answerable

to the old cursed nations he prayeth here or prophecieth rather of the ende of the sacrilegious brood
note

first seeing the pride rage and rapine of the enemie is so presumptuous associating themselues so dangerously conspiring our ruine so mischeiuously assuring themselues of the spoile so confidently wee haue no other hope but to haue recourse vnto our god by the example of the auncient godly by our sacred and serious supplications desiring him to inhibite them as he best can and shall best please for that their tumults cannot otherwise be tamed nor their spirits charmed
secondly many are the meanes that god can frustrate his foes by sometime making them like a wheele vnstable and vnconstant deluding their firmest conclusions with variable resolutions· sometime like stubble causing the matter of temptations to euaporate in fearefull transgressions sometimes like wood but euer fruitlesse sometime like the mountaines subliming their proiections into emptie eleuations sometime dispersing with the stormes of his indignation such stubborne humours as will admit no other impressions
thirdly it is not for nothing that the spirit doth accumulate so many words to the same purpose as names of enemies formes of ruine similitudes of vengeance but either to shew vs the vehemencie of the saints affection or the certentie and celerity of the aduersaries destruction or else the pertinacie of their opposition or lastly the difficultie of the oppresseds consolation

fill their faces with shame that they may seeke thy name lord hitherto of their ende to themselues and vs now as it respecteth the glorie of god
note
many men by stripes and smaller iudgements are sometime drawne to some confused and obscure knowledge of god so that their consciences are conuinced that they haue sinned against heauen to the ende that their truculencie which is increased by impunitie may be confined in some bonds of mediocritie

we must make a difference of men that ioyne in the same sin limus vt hic durescit hic vt cera liquescit vno eodem{que igni for some are fearefully hardened other are wholesomely shamed by one and the same iudgement

but how is this that his verie pesecutors doe seeke his name did not saul goe to damascus a lyon and returned to ierusalem a lambe so are many laid prostrate as he was vpon their faces for conuersion when other are cast downe too but on their backs for confusion but such as belong to gods election sic confunduntur vt placeant sic pereunt vt permaneant

let them be confounded and troubled for euer let them be put to shame and perish the former vse concerned the corrigible sinner this the indurate and reprobate
note

all are not made of one mettall nor created to one end there are vessels of honour and vessels of dishonour there are none so desperate but may pertaine vnto election none so demure but may be of the reprobation therefore augustine praies aut conuertantur vt redeant aut confundantur vt percant

hardnes of heart is a fearfull sinne and a

fearefull signe that is such as bernard writes quod nec compunctione scinditur nec pietate mollitur nec mouetur precibus minis non credit flagellis duratur which neither is pricked with sorrow nor softned with loue nor mooued with praiers grows sturdier with menacings and harder with chastenings this is a symptome of finall desertion

that they may know that thou whose name is iehovah art the most high ouer all the earth
hee endeth with that which is the ende of all gods glorie
note
though contemners doe hate the light and like the fish called of some atramentarius conceale themselues in their owne suds yet god will declare his glorie so in them or on them that they shal maugre their hearts confesse the same though they had rather be ignorant of him


god is knowne to excell all men when he setteth forth his wisedome maiestie and power so palpably and plainely that man with all his imaginations can neither darken nor denie it
which must serue to beat downe all our opposition and reluctation against him for as much as no policie can alter no proiect resist that which hee hath decreed and that is the vp holding of his houses
finis

[Figure: Sr. Richard Nervdigate of Arbury in the County of Warwick Baronet [leaf motif]Of the electing of the Generall.
IF any Prince doe minde to erect his gouernement in the field: he must séeke out a sufficient and able man, each waies as well for the reputation and nobilitie of his Predecessors, as for his minde, bodie, vertue, and experience, to be his chiefe and high gouernour generall of the fielde, who shall by the Prince or some other of the Priuie Counsell before the Prince or els where, being authorised by the Princes commission, take his oth, in the which hee shall bee sworne to serue his Prince truelie and faithfullie, and to eschew and foresee all daungers and inconueniences, which may happen to the Prince his mayster to the vttermost of his power, and to be ruled by the determinate counsell in all needfull and profitable causes to the greatest furthering of his Prince any wayes, as well in marching, incamping, approch, eskirmish camisado, or retraite, or what other seruice with deepe care to iudge and foresee whether their deuises may redound to the best accomplishing of any exploite, or otherwise for the remedie of the Princes great charge.
Also, not to leuie or take vp any souldiers in his owne name, but in his Princes.
Such a one should be chosen to be generall vnto whom the Staffe should bee deliuered, binding him with a solempne oth that he carrie the sayd staffe and deale vprightlie with each man, all affection set a part, in causes of iudgement dooing alwaies according to equitie and iustice.
THe General principallie ought to bee a man that liueth in the feare of God, who must prouide that there bee Preachers and Ministers appoynted, for the daily ministration of Gods sacred and diuine worde, the which Preachers are to teach them their dueties towards God, and their obedience towards their Prince, Generall, and Captaines, and to perswade them in all enterprises valiauntlie, and manfullie to persist, in all such attemptes, as by the Generall and principall officers shall be thought meete, yeelding them an assured hope through their daily praier and seruing of GOD, to haue most happie successe in all their enterprises, for no doubt although it pleaseth the almightie to suffer the faithfull manie times to receiue punishment, yet the faithfull seruing of him yéeldeth an assured hope of victorie.
Generall ought to bee temperate, continent, and not excessiue in eating and drinking: Patient in trauaile, of witte prompt, whereby in the night time by quietnesse of minde the counsailes of Captaines examined, maie more perfectlie bee confirmed.
Hee ought to be content with simple fare: For the preparing of dishes full of delicatenesse and the too much thoughts and diligence about meates, corrupteth and drowneth the minde in such sort, that the time that ought to bee spent in the businesse that is to bee done, by the delicatenesse of the Captaines is most vainely consumed.
Hee ought too bee painefull, for that princiapllie it doth apperteine too a Generall that hee in the time of turmoyles of the Warre, may bee the last that is wearie.
Hee must bee quicke witted, forsomuch as Homere sayth, flying to the ende: that with his thought hee maie most quicklie discusse euerie thing, and with his minde make iudgement, and as it were deuine a farre of and foresee that which is to come: least when there happen chaunces neyther foreseene nor looked for, the Generall be constrayned sodeinly and vnprouided for to take counsaile, and the safegarde of things to commit most fearefully to fortune.
It behooueth him to be liberall, and not to bee couetous and desirous of gayne.
For surelie of this vice he ought most principally to take héede, forasmuch as he that is not giuen to passe much of giftes of Siluer and Gold, may most honorably haue the charge of such dooings, whereas those bee most wicked that will be drawne with the vnsatiablenesse of Golde, the which is such a weapon of so much might, and as it were with liuelie force to deliuer the weapon out of his owne handes and to giue to others.
He ought to be a faire speaker, for that considering the thinges that are to be intreated of for the Warre, iudge there will followe much vtilitie, considering that eyther hauing occasion to set men in araie to the battaile, the Generall comforting the souldiers easilie maie perswade euerie one of them to despise all perils, and to attend to the glorious enterprise.
For the sound of the Trumpet cannot so much inflame the mindes of men to take their weapons; and constraine them more valiantlie to fight, then the conuenient and according to the time the sugred taske of the Generall, which maie moue them, both vnto great actes for the loue of vertue, and encourage them for the desire of glorie, or els if neede bee, to comfort the mindes afflicted for some ouerthrow had, his wordes shall be a medicine.
Wherefore for the benefit of the hoast and to lighten heauinesse of accidents the accommodate speaking of the Generall by most reason is more to be desired then the industrie of Surgeons, which follow the Campe onelie to the ende to heale woundes, for that they take no care or charge but to heale the hurtes: but hee with sweete and curteous maner of speaking comforteth and most highlie maketh glad, the mindes of the weake and afflicted.
Besides this, hee confirmeth the mindes of them that bee whole, and retaines them that bee boldened, then how much more difficult it is to heale the infirmities that is hid, then those which maie bee both felt and seene, euerie man knoweth: and like as no Prince will erect an armie to send them without a Generall and determinate Gouernour: euen so the Generall ought not to bee chosen that knoweth not, nor hath the grace in speaking, and that lacketh the facilitie and vtteraunce of speache.
Likewise the Generall beeing confirmed in his degree, should bee pleasant, gentle, and cheerefull too them that will come to him, gladlie and willing to recompence the valiant and good, both with the liberalitie of the pursse, and dignitie of office, and with sharpe punishment to punish the slouthfull, malefactors, and offendors.
Also hee ought not in euerie place and too euerie man showe himselfe so benigne and gentle, least he happen to be despised, neither so proud and stoute that he moue other to beare him hatred.
And that hee doe this to the intent that with to much license and benignitie hee cause not the armie to bee dissolute, or with sharpnesse and seueritie make them alienate their mindes and beecome enimies.
Likewise the liberalitie of a Prince or Generall although it bee but little: if with benignitie liberallie at time conuenient it bee vsed, it maie get most greate beneuolence of the multitude; and from thence foorth the most assured fidelitie of the souldiers gotten, it doth adde vnto it securitie and constantnesse in anie enterprise, seeing indeede euerie man hopes to obtaine greater things, bearing themselues valiantlie in fight, when they knowe that in little things the liberalitie of the Generall commeth of the proper benignite of his owne minde.
It is necessarie that the Generall with his warrelike counsaile doe deliberate vppon euerie matter, and they beeing partakers of the counsailes are sworne in time and place to tell their iudgements, the which together with him of euerie thing ought to debate, forsomuch as all those things not anie man of himselfe hath found: hee maie alone by studie with himselfe examine, but hee ought not straightwaies to approue and confirme it, for that our thoughts and counsailes as a thing, vnto the which wee haue a naturall affection, if of others faithfull counsaile it be not holpen, easilie it maie beeguile vs, and manie times it is found full of errours, contrariwise those things that by iudgement and opinion of others bee approued, doe assure the minde and keepe things stable and sure.
Notwithstanding no man ought so little to trust to himselfe that alwaies he be of opinion weake and doubtfull, nor of himselfe so much too presume that hee thinke other cannot finde counsaile better then his: for that it shall bee necessarie that hee which is alwaies subiect too the counsaile of others, hauing altogether distrust of himselfe, came to chaunge infinit things whereby in weightie matters both hurt and incommoditie doth follow, as likewise he must needes either alwaies or oftentimes commit error, that not hearing the aduise of other, euerie thing doth attribute to himselfe alone.
The Generall shall often and vnlooked for resort vnto the Captaines tents and places of aboade to see in what towardlie readinesse they are or maie be in of a sodain, that hee cause the Captaines often to make like resort vnto the vnder officers and souldiers to see if they bee in the like orderlie readinesse for anie sodeine seruice.
Hee must receiue into his handes the order of all offices in writing, whereby hee maie the better vnderstand and iudge of them.
Likewise the names of all the souldiers of the bands, to see whether they haue their iust number.
SInce it standeth with the office of him that will gouerne well to be as forward in mainteining the good, and rewarding those that deserue well, as in sinceritie of iudgement to punish the wicked and offenders: the maister of the campe, bearing the entire and full authoritie of the office of a Generall, is to haue a regard, that iustice beare as great swaie in his armie as in anie the best ordered citie that can bee.
And therefore hee must prouide Iustices sufficientlie practised and studied, that they maie bee able to see what iustice will aforde in euerie case, alwaies prouided, notwithstanding that the lawes of armes be not broken, then the case vnderstood, let them decide the matter, and giue sentence brieflie.
For in the Campe they are bound to obserue nothing but that which the Captaine Generall shall appoynt, and that which naturall reason shall chieflie allowe of, admitting herein the Canons of the holie lawe of Christendome, to which all the good souldiers, as euerie faithfull Christian is bounde to be obedient vnto.
Next the maister of a campe hath to appoynt an Agozzino, Arcaldo, or a Prouest, who besides that he must be well seene in his Arte, must haue regard that hee entertaine a conuenient retinue of assistauntes, and amongest the rest a Pretor or maister of iustice.
Hee must ordeine also that this Prouest with his seruauntes, and the Maister of iustice goe apparelled ciuiltie, and not as the custome is in manie cities like abiectes, that thereby they maie haue credite in their office, and be obeied as they ought, and this must bee proclaimed through the armie generall: namelie, that they obeie these officers vppon paine of death.
Hee must forbid all souldiers except Sergeants who in diuers causes ought to haue their weapons about them to restrict all others of what fort so euer, by that meanes to preuent those theftes and murthers which are commonlie committed in such places of men giuen to the spoyle.
Hee must cause by all meanes possible all priuie mutinies to be abandoned, and all priuie grudges and enmities to bee forgotten, during the time of Warre, which otherwise will bring greate hurte to the Campe, considering that manie doe leaue house and home to goe to Warre, not so much to doe their Countreie seruice or winne to themselues practise in battaile, thereby to become equall in value to couragius mindes, eyther els to deserue paie with the recompence of his doutie deedes, but rather some are pulled into the field to kill villanouslie some foe of their owne, or their fathers, or their friendes, men truelie most worthie of a thousand deaths, in that they seeke by treason to murder, in that place where they ought to looke to nothing els then to vphoulde iustice, and to procure that she maie haue hir due execution, and in iustice the punishment she deserueth.
He must care moreouer that respect bee had that merchauntes and puruaiers and other artificers that are too furnish the Campe with apparell, victuales, and other nessaries, that such maie haue traficke freelie, to the ende they maie doe it willinglie, and that they bée paied with good and lawfull Money for that they sell, enterteining them courteouslie, and too make them safe conduct as well too departe from thence, as too come thether, that they maie haue a desire too retourne: that by these the Armye maye haue store of things as well commodious for their helpe, as otherwise necessarie for their vse. Hee must rate the victuals at a reasonable price, that the souldiers bée not ouercharged in buying, and that the merchuunt may haue an honest gaine.
And as this care must bée had, so those things as lesse necessarie maie bée left to bée sould, as the buier and the seller can agrée, as householde stuffe, saddles, and all other furniture for horse, spiceries, weapons, and such merchandies.
Also hee must with greate counsaile and deliberation bestowe the lodgings, as next the trenches to bestowe the artilerie, and other munitions, and the ordinarie victuals giuing charge that none come néere the pouder with anie fire, neither gonner nor other souldier.
He shall assigne the quarters of the campe, to euerie companie his seuerall charge of the artilerie, which must bée kept vnoccupied for what néede so euer there shall bée, appoynting watch and ward continuallie, and that verie strong, whereby the souldiers maie bée the better conueied at pleasure, and the frontes the readier to bée defended against the enimie.
There must by him bée appoynted as it were a streate for Merchaunts, safe for themselfes, and commodious for all the Campe.
Then must there in euerie quarter bée appoynted places of ease as for their owne vse, and likewise for killing and dressing Cattell for foode, that by this meanes their lodgings maie bée kept cleane and the infection of the ayre auoyded for the benefit of health.
Then shall hée appoynt the footmen to bée distinctlie deuided from the Horsemen.
Hée must appoynt them so that euerie quarter haue his sere place for victuals: and after they bée lodged it ought to bée his greatest care to sée them well defenced: also that they maie so incampe as they maie haue the benefit of woode and water, especiallie in Winter.
These conditions hée must looke too with eyes well opened, viewing them diligentlie and oftentimes: and well considering them.
And also hée must foresée that the waie be commodious and readie, by which the armie may march and safelie be brought to the place of incamping.
Moreouer, it behooueth necessarilie to dispose both horsemen and footemen toward by daye, and watch by night, in places most daungerous, that the campe may remayne without feare of sodaine assaults, which otherwise brings great trouble.
And when the armie shall by anie accident eyther by daye or night, be forced to come to battaile, he must diligentlie prouide, that the artilerie, the munition and victuals, maie be safelie garded.
Likewise the discipline of Warre doth require at his handes in his owne person a certeine sharpe behauiour, that thereby he maye winne obedience of his souldiers, which is of as greate importance, as anie thing els he can haue.
Thus he shall verie well discharge his duty towards his Prince, as otherwise preserue the safety of him and his.
Also considering that in an armie there is a greate multitude of men, diuerse in nation, differing in maners, not equall in yeares, in nature not altogether agreeing, wherefore they which for pride and insolencie, wil not submit themselues to the martiall ordinaunces, maie bee constrayned through feare of punishment: it apperteyneth to such, to prouide such sufficient garde, as anie repairing for reliefe, cariages, or otherwise eyther for horsemen or footmen, or other beastes which are continuallie in the hoast to be occupied.
In this office the Lord Iohn Baptist Marques of Cassano, the Commender of Saint Iames greatlie deserued comendation being great mayster of the campe in the two iourneys too Germanie in the time of the renowmed Emperour Charles the fift, against the Launcegraue, the Duke of Saxony, the countie Palatine, and diuers other Princes then in confederacie with the Almaines.
THis offcer is of greate reputation, and hath to his charge committed, the payments of Colonelles, Captaynes, and all other officers, he ought in the beginning to receiue from the Generall, the true number, both of Horse and footemen, within the campe or army, and by perfect computation, to make a booke how much is due euerie moneth to euerie Colonell Captaine, and other officers, as well for themselues as other bands.
He ought to make his proportion of paie well knowne to the Generall, whereby the Generall might accordinglie make his prouision, that money be not wanting to paie the souldiers.
Hee ought to conferre with the mayster of the victuals to see how hee is furnished, and accordinglie, to disburse vnto him that hee bee not destitute of prouision.
Hee ought in like sort to make alowaunce when neede shall bee, to the mayster of the ordinaunce, for supplying his store of munition, as hee shall see cause, by reason of the consuming of the olde, or anie importaunt seruice to be done.
Hee must conferre with the muster mayster to see how the bands be furnished; and what souldiers bee slaine, when and howe maine, and when newe supplie is made, deliuering paie to euerie Colonell, and Captaine accordinglie, keeping their warraunts for his discharge.
He ought also at the pay day to conferre with the mayster of the ordinaunce, and mayster of the victuals too see what is due vnto the Prince by the Colonell and Captaines for munition and victuals, and to deduct so much in their wages.
This officer ought to bee a man of greate wisdome, and well experienced in martiall affaires: because hee is vsed in counsell, where hee is to speake his opinion in all exploites of importaunce, although they concerne not directlie his office.
THis officer being one of the chiefe officers, for that charge of all the artilerie and munition for the warres is committed vnto him, would be a man of learning and experience, whereby hee shall the better conceiue anie exploite, wherein a very good wit without experience shall be amazed.
He ought to bee studied in histories, the better to consider of such strategems as heeretofore by other noble Souldiers hath beene vsed, the sundrie sortes of ingennes too assault and defende, also howe too passe Bridges and Waters, with other inuentions for conueying of greate ordinaunce ouer marshes.
Hee ought to bee studied in the mathameticalles, considering hee shall bee the better able to shoote at anie randons, to conueye mines vnder the earth, to anie curtayne, Bulwarke, or other place that shall be determined to be torne a peeces.
Hee ought to what quantitie of shot, powder, &c. shall be requisite for anie batterie or other exploite, and to set out in due proportion euerie particular fortification of Campe, towne, or fort, whether ordinaunce is to be vsed without the knowledge of those sciences, cannot sufficientlie be discharged, and that mayster of ordinaunce through ignoraunce shall commit his trust to the bould presumptious persons, whose want of experience will but shame themselues, dishonour him and ouerthrowe their enterprise.
He ought at the receite of his charge to make an inuentorie of all such things committed to his charge, as wel to render an account, as to consider the want of euerie sort of munition for the warres.
To this officer apperteyneth to haue a Liuetenaunt, and certeyne clarkes in wages, who are to attend inferiour causes, rendering an account of all their dooings too the mayster of the ordinaunce.
It apperteyneth too the mayster of the ordinaunce too prouide all such necessaries as too the artilerie apperteyneth, as Wheeles, Exeltrees, Ladles, spunges, Bullets, Chayneshot, Crosbarres, Serpnetine powder, Mattockes, shouels crowes of yron, handaxes, engins for the mounting of ordinaunce, graundmaundes or gabions, little handbaskets, ropes, and all other
Item, to haue such gouernours as are not onelie skillfull in the readie managing of their peeces, but also in the making of trunkes, bawles, arrowes, and all other sortes of wilde fire, and for the continuall supplie of them, they ought to haue in a readinesse greate store of Sulphur, Rosin, Calx viue, Lint seede Oyle, and comcom Lampe Oyle, Pitch, Tarre, Campher, Waxe, Tucia, quicke siluer, and Aquauite: hereof to frame bals to burne in the water, cressets, and torches, that stormes and winde cannot extinguish, murdering bullets to shoot out of morter peeces, and such like.
Item, euerie peece of ordinaunce to haue his conuenient number of horse or Oxen too drawe, and carters too guide and keepe these beastes, and euerie peece to haue his gunner or two, to attend thereon to charge, discharge, and mount the peece, also to wade, ram, cleanse, scoure, and coole the peeces, when they are ouer heated, and for this purpose they shall haue in a readinesse, spunges, vineger, and colde water, &c.
For these gunners, there must be one maister gunner ouer all.
Item, if anie band want pouder, or shotte, the maister of the ordinaunce vpon request of the Captaine, is to giue order to his clarkes, to deliuer the same, and to take a bill of the Captaines for their discharge, the which at the paie daye must bee deliuered to the treasurer, who is to staie so much of the Captaine and his band.
To this officer apperteineth to haue in a readinesse certein boates made for the purpose with flat couers of sawed planks whiche chained together maie make sodeinlie a bridge to passe an armie ouer anie water, who must haue cables, and ankers to let fall in a violent streame.
The Maister of the ordinaunce is to haue attend vpon his charge a sufficient band for the gard of his charge, and also pioners to make plaine the waie for his carriages, and to entrench the place in the camp, appointed by the Prouost for the atilerie.
That there bee carpenters, Bowyers, Fletchers, Masons, and such skilfull artizans, with all tooles necessarie and néedfull too preserue, repaire, and make all things appertaining to artilerie.
When the daie of seruice is, the Maister of the ordinaunce is too select a place conuenient too plante his ordinaunce as well to noye the enimie, as also to be in such sort garded and fortified, as by no waies it be not surprised by the enimie.
Also in the camp, towne, or fort, he onelie is to giue order for the planting of the artilerie, and fortifications of the flankers to the best aduantage, and also to forsée that the Maister gunner and other gunners doe their duties which appertaines to their office, also in besieging to haue no lesse care in placing his Batterie for the cutting of the flankers before the assault be giuen.
Also the Maister of the ordinance is to giue order for the accomplishing of anie plat by mynes, and the Captaine of the mynes and Pioners, are to followe his direction.
Finallie, this office is of great reputation in the field, and manie exploites dependeth therevpon: but for that he cannot well performe all himselfe, he maie refer the small to those that serue vnder him, and to execute the great himselfe.
VNto this officer apperteineth too haue the charge of all the horsmen of the field, as of Hargulaters, Lighthorsmen, Lances, and men at armes, who immediatelie after entring into his charge, must view the election of the Captaines appointed, whether they bee meete for such a charge, or appointed by fauour: and to make report vnto the Generall, whereby such maie be appointed, as haue bene brought vp in militare profession.
He must kéepe a booke of all the bandes committed too his gouernement, with the names of the Captaines, and to peruse whether the bands be furnished with horse, armor, péeces, lances, and all such necessaries, for that warlike profession, as vnto such apperteineth.
He must giue great charge, to all the Captaines for the training of their bands, and to giue order in what sort, in what place and time, they shall exercise their bands: and if default be either of furniture and otherwise, to make certificate to the Generall or high Marshall, that defaults maie be amended.
He must dispose euerie sort of weapons in seuerall troupes by themselues, who must appoint them in seruice, as hee shall be directed by the Generall, or Lord high marshall.
Hee is to appoint what bands shal watch and what vancorriers, prouiding that they which watch the night, may rest the daie, and others to supplie their places, that conuenient rest maie be had, wherby man and horse maie the better continue in seruice.
Also at the sound of the trumpet in the morning hee shall with all the troupes of horsemen repaire to the Generalls Tent, to knowe his pleasure, and then immediatelie to sette forth the Generalls standerd, causing all the troupes with their guydions to place themselues in rankes after the Generall, that hee maie at euerie sodaine, drawe foorth such numbers that shall be required by the Marshall, or Generall.
Hee ought to giue warning to such horsemen as shall watch the night ensuing, that they maie bee the better able to doe suche seruice as they shall bee enioined too doe.
When the Lord Marshall pretendeth to incampe, the Lieuetenant is to appoint a conuenient band to attend vpon his person, and to appoint a companie to take their rest, which shall feede their horses, till such time as he shall deliuer them to the scowte Maister at night, who shall inioine them what to doe all the night after, and shall also deliuer them their watch word.
And at such time as they enter into the campe, the Lieuetenant shall cause thr horsemen to kéepe the field, till all the footmen be encamped, causing first one band to enter, and the rest to keepe the field, and so orderlie to followe, placing themselues as the last bands maie bee as wel lodged, as the first.
He must giue order that the coziers come not out of the field, till the trumpet sound to the watch, and sentinel come from the campe to take their places in the field.
Hee must appoint a sufficient number of horse to attend vpon the forage maister, to gard and defend the foringers which must not returne out of the field til the forering maister with the rest be returned to the camp, these must rest all that night, and the next day.
Hee is to appoint a reasonable conuey of horsemen for the safe bringing of victuals to the campe, to see that no violence be offered vnto them, and so to order the chaunge of his horse in these seuerall seruices, that some bee not ouerburdened, and others spared to much, but all things so ordered as none haue cause to repine.
Hee is in the daie of battell to appoint the hargubeters the which are the first to seruice, the light horsemen Lancis, men at armes in seuerall troupes with such distaunce as one maie rescue an other, who with the Lorde marshall is not onelie to giue his aduise, but in those actions to bee a leader.
He must haue regard that hee chargeth not in the front of his footmen, for being repulsed he maie be the ouerthrow of them, but let them charge vpon the flanke, and diligently attend if they can perceiue if anie breaking or opening of the side in the enimies battell be, and sodeinly to charge that breach.
For as horsemen are inferiours to well ordered footmen, so vpon euerie little occasion they carie victorie with them.
The offences committed by these regiments are to bee reformed by the Lord marshall, who should haue the Captaine of that band by whom offences are committed, to sitte in iustice with him, with such other of the said band as maie be thought meet by the Lord marshall, and the souldier condemned to be executed with the same weapons of the offenders, vsed by his owne company.
THe valiant Coronell after his lawfull dispatch from the Generall, and the obteining of his letters patents from the Generall, and monie for the conduction of that number of souldiers, appointed to his gouernement, hee must with all diligence choose and appoynt so manie Captaines as hée shall haue neede of, appointing iii.C. men for a company, which is a conuenient number: For if the number were diuided into smaller companies, the more money would be spent vpon the officers.
And besides, where many diuisions are: there happens the sooner discord and disorder.
Those Captaines would bee chosen of yeares and good experience, whereby they may the better execute their office, as otherwise too obtaine the loue of the souldiers, graunting vnto them sufficient authoritie for the executing of al things apperteining to their charge.
He must then deliuer vnto them equally so much mony as he hath receiued for the companies by prest, foreseeing that it be sufficient for such an effect, that the Captaines and officers may not be hindered by extraordinarie expenses, and the souldiers to haue better liking of the Coronell, as otherwise to winne them to obedience, which is most co~uenient for men of yt calling.
He must haue speciall regard, that the Lords or principall officers, whose minds are addicted to auarice by their vnsatiable desire of gaine, the good souldier be not anie waies hindered of his paie, which would do so much hurt to his good nature, without whom the Coronell can auaile little or nothing: and that he giue straight charge that such money as they receiue be laied out and spent with aduisement and discretion.
Hee must choose a Liuetenant of good experience, qualities, and behauiour, that hée maie the better attend on the charge of his owne companie: and besides, too haue care of all the bands apperteining to the Coronell.
Then must he choose an ensigne bearer, who must be a worthy souldier, a Gentleman of noble parentage, as otherwise gentle of behauior, who of all the rest of the officers must be superior.
Also he must choose the Sergeants, the masters of the squares, droms and other officers, who must be of honest behauior and of great experience in their offices.
He must appoint to his armed pikes his most valiant souldiers, who must bee gentlie vsed, shewing vnto them a chéerfull and good countenance, which to them is most acceptable.
Then must he chuse a sergeant maior who must bée a tried souldier and of great experience, and one who hath executed and professeth the office: There belongeth to his office great aduertisement, as to alter or remoue the armie, as sometimes the straightnes of time doth require, sometimes the discommoditie of the place doth inforce, sometimes the order in which the enimie is placed doth compell, yea and somtime some practise of his owne, or some deuise of his Coronell doth put into his head, whervpon great aduisement would be taken, minding not further to speake of it, but to refer it vntill come vnto his owne office, where will more amplie speake of it.
There must by him be appointed, a furrior or harbinger, who shall without rewards or corruption lodge the whole companie of the Coronell, vsing his office honestlie and indifferentlie, without pleasing of anie particular man.
He must appoynt a generall Drum, which shall take care of the rest of the Drums, who must be authorised to command the rest of the Drums, hauing a care that they vse obedience: and that euerie one do his part that belongeth to his office, as in sounding the march, a call, the charge, the batteile, the retrait, &c. Hee ought to prouide himself the best munition, fit for a coronels charge, as corselets, pikes, caleuers, murrians, holberds, bils, lead, match, and of al manner of victuals, the which shall be deliuered by the Sergeant maior.
He must also examin the election yt the Captaines haue made, of al their officers throughout the companies, and if they be such as ought to be, or not much worie, he may allow them and not otherwise.
And it is to be vnderstood that these and the like aduertisements do make to appeare the very insight of the conductor, whereas not being narrowlie looked vnto, the contrarie happens: It séemes not out of purpose that euery company haue
hargubusiers too serue on horseback, who being honest men, may do great seruice both on foot and hors back, as often hath ben séene, as well in carefull following.
kéeping or recouering of passages, as for the discouering the watch word of the enimies, and to cast downe and leuell places the easier to make roods to discouer in manner of lighthorsmen: and for to conclude, following these precepts by exercising thy souldiers often, shall bring them soone to experience the better to bée guided.
He must procure that his officers diligently performe his commissions, and that faithfullie they make relation of euery particular thing that he may be enformed of all, and in especiall that happens in wards, as well by daie as by night: for they going in circuite as apertaines vnto them, may wel perceiue what chanceth of any great importance.
He ought carefullie and courteouslie to exhibite to the generall Captaine great reuerence to honor him, obey him and faithfully counsel him: and for the performance of this, he must refuse no trauaile, sith that taking paines in causes of such importance is very méet for men of his calling an office: for gaines and delicate pleasures rather to women or those that more estéeme riches then vertue, and more accounpt of the body, then the soule.
Of the office of the great Sergeant or Sergeant maior.
INasmuch as good order is necessarie in all humane actions, the waightie office of the Sergeant maior, must néeds be exellent and of great importance as vnto whose charge and authoritie apperteineth, not only to gouern, but also to bring into forme, and to execute the greatest part of the chiefest affaires which require any speciall seruice in the army.
expert and worthy soldiers, whose aide at al times he must vse, which he must erect as principall Corporals, who in his absence are to succeed him both in office and authoritie.
He must after he hath receiued his charge of his Lord and Generall vse al diligence and warinesse, not onely to mainteine it, but also to increase it in the minds of ye Captaines and other head officers, as also of ye common souldiers, in whatsoeuer apperteineth to his charge, to the intent, that both those which of themselues knowe their duetie, and of other which are bound to their indeauour to him wards: he maie haue that ready obedience shewed him that is required, for if that be denied him, no diligence that he can vse, may auaile any iot to giue any hope of good successe in his great office, as by many examples hath bene shewed.
It is necessary for him that is in this office, to forecast with himselfe, to consider and foresée all chaunces before they happen, and to foretell euery one what he hath to doe, for that very often he shall be taken at vnwares, and the time that he hath for the dispatch of his businesse is very short, howbeit the straightnesse of time must no whit appall them, or any waies hinder him from executing his businesse wiselie and readilie, as hauing his wits at commaundement euen in this brunt, otherwise if he haue not before cast in his owne minde, and instructed others how to behaue themselues, he cannot looke for any prosperous ende of his businesse, séeing at the very instant when they are to ioyne with the enimies, there can be no great heed giuen vnto that which hee commaundeth, for that their eares wil be otherwise occupied, and full of rumours, hurliburlies, and confusion, which by their noyse will rise on the sodeine.
Moreouer, it behooueth him to know to how many armed pikes and to how many holbards he hath to giue charge, and to how many vnarmed of both sorts: besides, to haue many hargubuseires on foot, and how many on horsebacke, and to be short, hee must knowe the whole number of able souldiers he can make, to the end when occasion shall be, he may the readier place in the voward or rereward some in one wing, and some in another to defend the carriage, or to inuiron the enimie, him to guide his band, and the rest to like offices, and he must commaund the Captaines, that they repaire with their companies when any rumour is made, to the place where the artilery and the munition is kept, charging them that they come neither straieng in sunder nor vpon heapes (as in like cases men vse with great disorder, but to bee carefull to keepe themselues with their ensignes, that thereby they may bee in a readinesse too giue a valiaunt onset in places where most neede shallbe.
For it is often séene that the munition of the artilerie is very hotlie assalted by the enimies, the more to discipate and deceiue the force of the army, and to breake in vpon them with more ease after they come to the place aforesaid, of the munition.
Euery band with the ensigne must attend to follow the Sergeant Maior, or the Corporals, who shall in silent manner, and with all obedience, follow the appointment of the Sergeant Maior, or his Corporals, placing their companies in such order as by them shall be thought good, hauing regard that the most valiant and best armed pikes be alwaies appoynted in the fronts, and rereward, so many rankes as may impale the bils and ensignes in the wings, whereof the battaile will come, called the quadrant of people and ground, and not that of people: this battaile is of great force to shoulder and beate downe the enimie, for that there are more souldiers placed in ranked then are in any other forme, and yet they occupie a lesse plat.
The shot must bee placed as sleeues or wings to the battaile, the which must flanke the battaile, as a curteine doth a fort.
He hath to cause them dayly to remoue and exercise themselues, to the end when neede requireth, neither the wings should be dissolued by pages missing] and faire speach as much as hee maie, and that hee indeauour to guide them by a signe, rather then by wordes: who in this the Lorde Chappinuittello deserued great praise.
If vpon any alarum a sodayne noyse or rumour be raised whereby he shal haue chause to gather his armie together in the night time, hee must strst commaund all the Captaines, that their Quarries and their Cressets being light euery one by it selfe, the Captaines must bring their companies in troupe, placing their Shot in the Uoward and Rereward, the Pikes and Billes next the Ensignes into the maket place, and so conueied to any place of seruice whereas neede shall require, euery one besturring him in such sort, that in a moment as it were, and out of hand they may bee armed and readie, in that place to bee receiued of the Sergeant Generall, when of him they must be ordered in battaile, the which for the night is the Battaile called the halfe Moone, who must within the compasse of the two hornes place all the with their Ensignes in their handes, then behinde them the armed Holbards, next vnto these the vnarmed Pikes, and without the greate Circle betwéene both the Hornes of the Moone, must bee placed the the armed Pikes, and the one halfe of the Sergeants and Liuetenaunts must attend on this greate charge without, but the rest of the Captaines with the Sergeant Generall must attend on the companie of armed Pikes, and most of the Drummes and the Lights must be in the voyde space betweene both the hornes and before the Ensignes, where sitting to giue hearing of the Imbassage and Messengers which come and goe in such cases, they must deliberate and take counsayle what is best to bee done.
The enteraunce of this place must bee turned to the most safetie that the situation of the place shall offer.
Besides, they may for the surer, place some part of the Artillery of the field, nowe the Hargubusiers must be bestowed by the Sergeant Maior, so farre distaunt from the Square in so many Troupes, and so many formes as the condition of the place shall require, which maie soone be perceiued by the expert, thereby to fortifie the maine battaile, prouided with al, that euerie companie of hargubusers thus placed, haue his co~panie of officers appointed ouer them, with their droms, as if be néedful with their lights that they may be readie and seruiceable in euerie chaunce that may befall, in my iudgement, in these skirmishes by night neither mesure of Geometrie, nor the nu~bers of Arethmetike are so necessarie as the diligence of the valiant and discréet captaines is expedient, who haue to stir vp the minds of their companies, reme~bring alwaies their obedience vdto the greate Sergeant, whose will they are onelie to execute.
haue the rather set downe this square, for that it hath bene oftentimes well ordered of manie valiant captaines of Italie, and especiall of the L. Alexander Vitellie.
Concerning the other formes of battailes which are to be vsed in the night, minde to omit thinking this to be sufficient, and easie to be ordered and besides not commonly knowen, except a battaile representing full crosse, to which there are so good rules that they may serue any number by day or night to be ordered, and the rather doe it, because speake not sufficiently in their places in the second book, yet as well as can, not so well as would, ioining to them certain others, to the end, that if in nothing els haue pleasured the valiant expert, yet at the least the proportions of these formes maie giue them some small helpe.
Then when as vpon any doubt the armie shal re+moue to march, he shal place ye armed pikes vnarmed with their bils ensignes, in such sort, that when néede shal be to double the ranks to make the armie greater, and yet the armie maie kéepe his former proportions: that is to saie, that the voward rereward deuide betwéene themselues al the armed corslets and vnarmed pikes, so that the flankes in long wise be not vnarmed.
So shal it come co passe that the short weapons shal gather together, in the midst of them the ensignes.
The vnarmed pikes are not to be reiected in the plaine field seing it is verie hard, and peraduenture not altogether mt that any should be armed pikemen, as it is trulie said, they with the armed are the whole strength of the footmen, so the hargubusers must onely serue to flanke to ease the defences, to lie in ambushment, to skirmish, to approch, and in all other functions, and at a word, to incumber the enimie, either in defending the enimie, or to assalt any fort.
He must haue a care in the making of this battaile quadrant, the which of all other holde ye best that for Corporals or Sergeants do perfectly vnderstand, how many ranks are in a companie, aduertising them with all, that euery companie be agréeable together in the number of the ranks, which be of many called maniples.
Then must he cause the~ to march one hard after another, seing euery co~panie guided by their officers, and being come to the place to contain them of ease, commaund the first companie to march from the rest, to make space, willing the second to ioine vnto the first as a flanke, then the third likewise vnto the second and the fourth to the third, and so from hand to hand.
Hée shal frame a valiant battaile to encounter the enimie howbeit it is very hard to kéepe a iust in order of so many men in ranke, and of so many rankes as the rule of the Theorikes oth doth teach, for that very often the companies are vnlike, either in nu~ber or weapons then marching thus together on this order, hee must commaund that all the ensignes vnder one Coronell march together, not mingling themselues with the ensignes of other Coronels Now the co~panies being thus doubled the battailes ingrosed, as is said before, euery ensigne may seeke out his owne band, stand with it both for ye greater encouragme~t of them, the more safety to himself but if they return to march at length euery ensign shall place himselfe amongst the rest as his lot fals out, the hargubusires seuered from the battaile must march half of the~ by the Uoward, the other halfe by ye Rereward, either a little towards the right hand or towards the left, either as the commoditie of ye place, or doubt of any danger shall require.
Then doubting the rankes of these hargubusires, as much as shall be néedefull, they must be ingrossed, then vex is carefully placed for the flanking of ye main battail, vnderstanding with all, that it behoueth very much aswell these two wings of hargubusires, with the voward rereward of the chief battaile, the ordinance should be co~mitted to the guide of worthie Captains, of officers of credit, of expert souldiers, yt they may be able to help in all extremities, and to resolue the~selues in any doubt, knowing what is to be done without waiting for the counsaile of others, in cause where such cou~sail is neither present nor at hand.
The bodie of the square like a wedge must haue in the first rank one man, in the second thrée men, in the third fiue men, so till euerie ranke increasing by two souldieiers, which rule is very perfect, kéepeth iust in proceeding to infinite numbers, of two wedges ioined together, a battaile may be well called the shéeres, thrée or foure ioined together a battaile called ye saw, with manie others, the which were much vsed amongst the Romans and other nations, the battaile in full forme of a crosse, hauing foure fronts containing all sorts of weapons belonging to footemen is verie profitable, as may be vnderstood by the rules of the Theoriks, as otherwise in the proper place of the battail appeareth in the
And although all these battailes be not in vse, yet all these formes seeme verie profitable if they might be ordred and disposed in place conuenient, howbeit all are not very to march: and as in my iudgement it is not very easie to shewe by wordes the manner that must bee kept in giuing the assault to the enimies, either by day or by night, considering that a man hath alwayes to applie himselfe to the warlike policies and deuises of his Lord that gouerneth him.
For it hath béen often séen that the onset hath béen giuen by the coriers on horsebacke, manie times by ambushes well placed in couert hauing aduantage of such as lie in scowt, who wait their time to assail them at vnawares, when they may most endamage them.
might here speak also (as appertaining to the Sergeants office) of the prouiding the principall munition, the armour and victuals other things necessarie for the armie, and the bestowing of them: besides that, hée hath a part in the businesse which belongs to the great master of the camp, as to place the wards within the camp, and to appoint the watch worde by which the same wardes are gouerned and the whole campe.
might speak of these things if they were to bee done alwaies after one sort, or had one ordinarie manner.
But for that they bee variable according to the nature and disposition of him that gouerneth, and very often, as place and time shal require, will omit them.
It may suffice to shew in part what appertaineth to the office, that thereby he may the redilier dispatch what shall bee appointed of his Lorde.
Those things which shall bee giuen him in charge of anie importance, shalbe giuen him in writing, reseruing besides a copie thereof, that if he either misse in his obedience, or otherwise by his default anie mischance shall happen in matters of waight, he may not say but that hee was forewarned, that whatsoeuer is to be done by them may be done in their course and order: thereby to auoyde all brawles and iarres which myght happen amongest Officers euerie man knowing what appertaineth to his charge.
When the face of the Battaile, must bée turned, hee muste giue warning that euerie manne turne his face, and not his Weapons, that there doe no noise arise in such cases.
And this may be done best and most readilie, if euerie souldier kéepe the point of his weapon in his hande, which doth giue a glorious shew, and besides that doth make them readie to lay on their shoulders againe, if they haue cause to march againe at length· and he shall giue order whe~ the army remouing, do come to any straight passage or other discommodious place which may break their order, that euerie ranke doe passe after another, and when they he beyond ye straight, that then they place them in order againe, which being obserued in euerie rank, they may presently be in some order, as they were before the readier to be brought to the formes squares before rehearsed.
And when anie charge or commandement is to be giuen, see it set and ordeined in the Rereward, and when there is nothing to bee done, hee shall raise the armie, Hée shal likewise commaund that euerie Ensigne march with his owne companie to the end when they come to be incamped, they may the easiliar be brought to their lodging appointed for them.
Of the electing and office of the foure Corporals of the fields.
GReat regard woulde be had to the choosing of these, as well for their calling, yeares and valiantnesse, as otherwise for their experience, lenitie, and wisedome.
Whereby these Warlike affaires may be the readier and sooner executed, otherwise it may be preiudiciall to the whole Armie.
These be vnder the Sergeant generall to appoint, set, order, and make battaile and battailes, and and to guide euerie particular personne therein, according to their degree and office, and as the necessitie of the same shall require, to instruct and reforme, whose commaundementes all Captaines and Souldiers with their Officers must obeie.
But in march, approch, camizado, skirmish, retraite, watch, warde, or what other seruice by them shal be commanded, whose authoritie likewise is such, as if any resist, they shall by the Prouost matiall be punished as rebels, of what calling or degrée soeuer they be.
Two of these are appointed to the placing and ordering of shot, and the other two for the embatteling of the pikes and bile, who according to their worthinesse, if death happeneth, are to succeed the great Sergeant or Sergeant maior.
SUch must by the Generall of the armie be appointed and chosen twelue honest, wise, graue men, the which saide twelue he shall appoint to bee his iudges and determiners in all martiall discipline and correction.
His choise is to bee made of Captaines or otherwise at his pleasure, so hee bee of staied iudgement and of honest sobrietie The which said iudges being is elected and chosen shall haue their wages accordingly appointed them, who except in great extremitie shall bee watch frée.
These shall sweare and protest solemnitie by the almightie God vnto the saide Generall, that they will serue the Prince by the moneth in that which they are chosen and called to, that they wil seriusly, faithful, obedient, and dutiful vnto the Generall in all néedfull and lawfull affaires, and at al times vprightly indifferently to iudge all causes comming before them, to bée obedient to the commandements of the Generall standing with equitie and the lawes of the fielde, that they will to the vttermost power indeuour them selues to giue counsaile and aduise to see Generall to the and commoditie of the Prince and his subiects, and iustly to iudge the rich as the póore not regarding friendship, kindred, or any other corrupting cause which may lead affection to the hinderance of Iustice: but to their knowledge to minister equitie according to the tenour of the lawes, as they wil that God helpe them at the last dreadful day of iudgement.
Also that in mustering they doe diligently foresée to their vttermost power that the prince their maister be not deceiued in giuing double paie to such as are not worthie, and that they shall also deliuer the names of the souldiers vnto the Generall as they mustered them with a note of their aloweance and wages vnder their hands and seales faithfully without anie deceipt.
Of the othes that euerie officer ought to take, of what Office so euer he be.
Of the Pretor, THe Pretor shall take his oath giuen him by the Generall, who shall sweare by almightie God that whatsoeuer he shall iudge, ordaine, or determine in court, or out of court, that he shall kéepe it close and secret to his liues end, and that he shall bee true and iust to the Lords, and that he shall execute iustice to his vttermost power, and that he shall not during the warres take anie gift of any man for any mat+ter in controuersie to be tried before him, but shall vse indifferent iustice to all men, without respect of persons friendship or malice, as God shal help him at the dredfull daie of iudgement.
HIs oath is likewise giuen by the Generall, that these points whereof doe consist herein, that hée shall sée all faultes duelie and according to the lawes punished in al offenders, without regard or respectt of persons.
That hée shall in the market place set vp a paire of gallowes both for the terrour of the wicked, as for execution vpon them that offend the lawes.
Also that he shall set on all victuals brought to the market a reasonable price, that the seller and the buier may reasonably liue by it.
And that he exact nothing beyond his duetie of anie man, that he neither vse extortion or briberie, that hee let no prisoner taken of the enemie or offendour otherwise to his witting escape, with other Articles conteined in his office, at the discretion of ye Generall, the which he must bée sworne vnto.
HIS oath is to be true and iust in his office, and nightly to attende vpon the Generall to receiue the watch word, the which at the setting of the watch, hee shall secretly deliuer vnto the Captaines.
Hée shall diuers times proue the watch, as well to see if they sleepe not, and such as hee findeth in fault to accuse them to the higher officers, who ought to appoint their punishment according to the tenour of the Articles: otherwise appertaineth vnto his office at the discretion of the Generall of the armie.
HIS oath is to bee true and iust in his office, and not to bee slacke anie time in procuring in his office good, fit, and wholesome victualles, as well for those souldiers in extraordinarie, as for those which are in ordinary seruice prest, not to werie or driue away from the victualing of ye Campe anie victualer by giuing him a more or lesse summe then they are wel worthie, to procure as many to serue the campe with good victuals as he can, both in giuing of them good and faire language: as also now and then to giue them some piece of money to encourage the saide victuallers to take paines with the like.
And that hee shall with diligence faythfully shun all things that shall anie wayes be vnprofitable vnto the Prince and the souldiers.
And to deuise as farre as his wit and iudgement will serue him to profit his Lord and Maister and his souldiers, as well for wholesome victuals, béere and wine, for their bodies, as for good swéet and wholesome meate for their horses, as well for such as serue in the fielde, as such as trauaile worke in the wagon, cart, or otherwise, which followe for the reliefe of the campe, and that of all these their doings, he kéepe a true perfect booke of accountes, and reckonings for the Generall, when and as often as it shall please him to call for it, that the rest of the counsell may be priuie to it, if so it shall bee thought good of the Generall of the fielde, for the better tryall of all his dealings.
HIs oth is, to be true and iust in his office, that without speciall commaundement of the Generall, not to aduenture to set anie thing on fire, vnlesse that the enemie bée encountred withall, and then without delay all mattters laide aparte to annoy the enemie by his skill what hee may.
And that hée doe not burne or waste anie cornehouses, or other thing that maye anie waies profite the campe, and that to his knowledge.
Hée shall not hurt or hinder any poore creature, or aged person that he may well spare, but extend mercie and pitie on them.
THe Notarie shal be sworne before the xii. Iudges of the Court, that he shall trulie without fraude exercise his office, not adding or diminishing, for friendship, malice, or bribery, any thing deliuered to him in Court, or els where, to the hinderance of equitie and iustice.
And that he precisely kéepe vndefaced and vncanceled all the recordes, the whole actes dealings of all men hanging in the Court, whether they be tried or vntried in controuersie not determined, and that he kéepe conceale all things that he heareth in the court, either said or done, as ended determined, secrete close to his liues end, and if he doe otherwise, he shall haue the lawe prouided for such an offender.
HEe shall take the like oth before the Iudge, to doe trulie and faithfully in his office at all times and places as the Iudge shal command him, so that through his diligence there bée no fault found in him at the court day, that hee kéepe close and secret all such matters as he shall heare handled by the Iudges vntill his liues end, as God helpe him.
THe noble custome of English warriours is to choose appoint to the leading of men, such Captaines as bée circumspect, skilfull, expert in the noble art of martiall affaires: also hardie, valiant of courage, painfull ingenious: liberall in rewarding: iust in seruice to their powers, aboue all thinges on the earth, ouer mindfull to render a iust account of that charge, daily regarding that their numbers bee furnished with men, armour, weapons, and munitions to them apperteining, with all other things to them néedfull to be vsed, distributed in times conuenient: oft calling foorth their numbers to muster, march, and traine the same in all such necessarie points of warre, as to such apperteineth.
They may not suffer any to continue and spend their time in idlenesse, leauing their armour, weapons, and other furniture, vnreadie to seruice at néede, but giue commaundement vnto their officers in their absence, circumspectly to looke vnto the same.
They may not suffer their souldiers to liue in too much libertie, neither to be outragious as some haue done in other countries in times past, as in whoorehunting, dronkennesse, common swearing, quarrelling, fighting, defrauding, or any other thing contrarie to the lawes of God and our Prince, and the order of the field: but vpon approuing any such offence, shall reforme, correct, and amend the same immediatly.
Good Captaines will haue speciall regard that such prouision be made for his souldiers in due time as vnto their numbers shall be néedfull and necessarie, as wel for victuals as for armour, and munitions, the same to be discretly vsed and in due time, by vitlers appointed, and to be distributed to their souldiers, to pay their wages truly, also to sée the vitlers and other artificers lending vnto soldiers vpon their credit at néed, vntill the pay day to be satisfied paied: also if any of their souldiers be taken prisoners, be raunsomed home in due time, that their bands be not long vnfurnished of men to the hinderance of seruice.
Captaines haue oft times committed to their charge and leading, soldiers of great honestie, substance, credit, so haue they others of small regard, both ignorant and wilfull, whom through their worthy and prudent gouernment may be so trained and instructed by word and déed, courteously gratifying the good, and sharply correcting the euill, that in short time all be brought to one ciuilitie of seruice.
CAptaines haue also oftentimes certeine exploits and points of seruice committed vnto them, wherein they must be very secret, vsing therein great discretion knowledge, as occasion of seruice shall require, as to vse to cownuoie, camisado, ambush, eskermish, approch, assault, retraite, &c.
The which sometimes requireth counsaile of the skilfull and expert souldiers, whose opinion they will diligently obserue and learne, gratifieng and rewarding according to the value of their counsaile: so shal they sometime proue circumspectly trie by fained pretenses, saying: they mind exploits, wil trauaile to some place, nothing pretending the same, but finding such rash busy bodies vnsecret to counsaile, presuming without knowledge or experience, afterward reuealing the same, will trie the truth punish the offenders, as to their demerits is méet.
Captains must be verie circumspect in choosing of souldiers to their officers of their bands, placing auncient, trauailed and skilful men, to charge according to their experiences, as lieuetenants, sergeants of bands, and other whose duties are hereafter mentioned.
Many other noble points vnto good captaines do apperteine, the which for tediousnesse in this omit, wishing that such be chosen, painful in trauaile, circumspect in wit, hardie of courage, liberall of hart in rewarding of seruice.
Thus trusting this briefe remembrance may signifie vnto the noble and expert, also to the vnperfect auaileable.
LIeuetenants of euery band ought to be men of great experience and ripenesse of seruice, whose authoritie in ye absence of the capteine extendeth to examine, trie, reforme, correct amend any offence within the band co~mitted, also day and night to bring the companie with the ensigne to the place of assemblie, there in order, traine and exercise the same, as to the necessitie of seruice doth apperteine, and béeing commaunded by the higher powers to march towards the enimies, must encounter and fight with the same, as if the Captaine were in presence, who vpon impediment must sometimes bée absent, otherwise to the Liuetenants charge apperteineth to watch, warde, approch, conduct, aduance against the enimie, to encounter, animate, comfort, and also to encourage the companies by word and déede, and as néede serueth to retire, continually mainteyning skirmish vntill he haue recouered some place of safegard.
THe Ensigne bearer must be a man skilfull, hardie, and couragious, of able courage to aduance beare dp the Ensigne, in all extremities secret, silent zelous, able often to comfort, animate, encourage the companie to take in hand and mainteine such enterprises as they are appointed vnto, neuer to retire, but when of noble pollicie the higher officers commaund the same, at such time as the Ensigne is committed vnto him, he must vowe and professe the same rather to be his winding shéete, and therein to loose his life, then through his defalt loose the same, of his discretion authoritie, espying the companie, trauell, or follow enimies to their discommoditie and peril, loosing the winde, hill, or ground of aduantage, disordering the araie, may stand still and commaund the drums fifes to stand sound the retraite, that the companie may resort come to the ensigne order the aray by aduantage of the ground, rather then abide the comming of the enimie, or follow as is aforesaid in time of approch, assault, or entering, imbrech he with his ensigne aduaunceth with the formost, giuing occasion that souldiers the rather follow the same.
Other points to his charge apperteineth, which shalbe hereafter more amplie declared.
SVch ought to be men sober, discret, and skilfull in the dutie of a souldier, able to bring the companie in order of aray, as to the ground and number shall be méet and conuenient, if the same be broken, immediatly place the same in order againe, alwaies readie day and night to seruice by the Captaine or by his Lieutenant commaunded oft times to instruct the companie, to march, traine, and trauaile as well by signes from him framed, as otherwise by wordes spoken, he must haue very great regard to the companie, to sée that their armour and weapons be in a readinesse alwaies to seruice.
None may resist his authoritie, but obserue as the Captaine in person: he may not heare any mutenous or rebellious wordes among the companie, but immediatlie reueale the same, that spéedie reformation may be had, and faults amended.
SUch must be chosen to euery hundred two honest skilful souldiers, either of them leading souldiers, of whose weapons they haue skill, must often call foorth their numbers, view their furniture, that nothing be lacking to the~ apperteining in time of seruice.
Also if any be sicke, hurt, or absent, by way of imprisonment or death: immediatlie they ought to make report of the same, and finding any cause worthie of relation, they must spare for no ma~ to report the truth to the Sergeant from him the Lieuetenant, so to the Captaine, and further vnto the higher powers if néede shall require.
Thus shall dignitie of offices be maintained, and faultes amended to the comfort of the rest.
THe Disners charge: foure such of the skilfullest souldiers béeing trustie and honest men must vnder the gouernaunce of the other officers bee appointed to euerie hundred, to diuers pointes of necessaries auaileable, two of them to haue charge of the shot, the other two of the pikes.
they are to traine and exercise according to their experience.
Also they must be lodged in the middest of their charge, wherby when any secret seruice is to bée done, they may cal numbers without the drum.
They be also a great reliefe in watch and ward.
SVch must be chosen of able sort and personage, secrete, and ingenious, skilful in the sounds and vsing of their instrumentes, which warneth as the mouth of a man to all intentes of seruice, diligent in times conuenient to instruct souldiers in the same, that none by ignoraunce neglect their duties.
Such be oftentimes sent on messages, importing charge, which of necessitie require languages, somtimes to summon or commaund the enimies to render, sometimes carrie raunsomes or redéeme, conduct prisoners.
Manie other thinges, to them doe apperteine, as héereafter shall appeare.
NEedefull it is that euerie companie haue one Surgeon, a man honest, sober, and of good counsaile, skilfull in that science, able to heale and cure all kindes of sores, woundes, and griefes, to take a pellet out of the flesh and bone, and to flake the fire of the same, and that hée haue all his tooles and instrumentes, with other necessarie stuffe, as oyles, balmes, salues, stepres, roulers, boulsters, splenters, and al other things to the science belonging, which also ought to haue courage for his patient and allowed stuffe.
He shall readily employ his industrie vppon the sore and wounded, not intermedling with others to his owne charge noysome, such bée placed with the ensigne, and lodged néere to the Captaine, and weare their baldricks in time of fight, which by lawe of the field is their charter.
Clarke of a Band would bée a man chosen of a discréete behauiour, such a one as hath the vse of his penne, and is skilfull in Arithmetike, who must haue a booke in the which hee must write all the names of the souldiers appertaining to ye band, diuiding euery weapon by themselues, yt they may be the readier to be mustred, as otherwise to be placed.
In order of march againe the Clarke at watch ward, must be attentiue with his booke to call euerie mannes name to sée who is absent, and that certificate thereof be made vnto the Captaine, who must without sicknesse or some speciall license of the head officers sée him or them punished to the example of all others.
Also the Clarke is to take charge of the Captaines munition, who séeing it deliuered vnto the souldiers, must take note how much is deliuered, vnto whom and what day of the moneth it is deliuered, with the price: likewise he must repaire to the Clarke of the victuals, and by the Captaines warrant to receiue such bread, béere, and other victualls as is to be had, and to deliuer it to those that shalbe thought by the Captaine to be of credit to vittell the band by the Princes price, and to take ticates of them as well for that it is deliuered vnto them, as what they doe deliuer vnto the souldiers.
Also he must in the Captaines name and by his warrant repaire vnto the marchants other artificers, and take such wares, as the officers and souldiers haue néede of, who must at the pay day by the Captaine be answered.
Also prouided that the vitler alloweth to the souldiers but vj. pence a daie, the ouerplus goeth to the payment of their furniture apparell.
The Clarke must also peruse the ticates to sée that no more be deliuered then their wages come to, that the Captaines thereby receiue no losse.
The Clarke ought to enquire when any be departed this world, also whe~ any be slaine or discharged the band, and to make a iust note thereof, wherby certificate be made to the muster maister, that ye Prince in no waies may be hindered, neither the Captaine by the vitlers receiue any detriment or losse.
IT is conuenient that euerie band, haue one honest and sober man appointed to vse daily praier among the souldiers, and in time conuenient to communicate with them, and to teach the companies their duties towards God their Prince, to giue good counsaile vnto the sicke, wounded, and weake in bodie or in conscience, and that such be well armed with spirituall armour, that is with good knowledge, good liuing, readie to perswade them manfully to withstand their enimies, the flesh, the diuell, and desperation, putting them in sure hope through faith in Christ to enter into the campe of euerlasting life, where they shal ride amongst the souldiers on white horses, clothed in white and pure silke, as witnesseth the holie Scripture of the almightie God of hosts, who of his mercie bring all souldiers vnto the Host of them.
THe noble custome of England is to furnish their numbers with manuall weapons to battaile appertaining, as with Caliuers, Courriers, Archers, or long Bowes, Pikes, Halberds or Billmen, which be hereafter signified by letters placed in order of aray, as men bearing such weapons may be placed the like to seruice conuenient, as hereafter by proportions shall more plainly appeare.
for Captaine for Lieutenant for Sergeaunt for Drums for Fiftei for Caliuers.
AS there is a great alteration of weapons, and also deuision of the same, purpose to note vnto you the iust numbers to euerie hundred at this present vsed: which shall greatlie profit to the making of your battailes from
v.C. vi.C. vii.C. viii.C ix.C. x.C shot. xi.C xii.C. xiii.C.
Heere followeth orders which are to be obserued for the furnishing of the weapons.
SVch must haue either of them a good and sufficient péece, flaske, touch boxe, powder, shot, fier, yron, mould, ramor, sworde, dagger, a murrion, in raine, mistes, and winds, their péeces charged primed.
They must carrie the touch hole vnder their armeholes, mach light in their handes couertly and drie, their péeces faire and cleane within and without: so bee they seruiseable at all times, hauing regard, they kéepe their mach and pouder verie drie, oft charged and discharged, march and retire of good distaunce a sunder, garding other, as hereafter shal plainly appeare by diuers examples.
NEce&s&sarie it is that euerie man haue a good and méete Bowe according to his draught and strength, light and easie: a Iacke with a skull, sword and dagger, nothing vpon his armes, whereby in time of seruice he maye easily draw the arrow to the head, that they may deliuer the same with strength an arte as Englishmen be accustomed.
They must haue also braser and shooting glooue, their strings whipped and waxed ouer with glew, their feathers drie: so bee they seruiseable in any weather to serue against the enemie to slaughter and execution.
THo&se bearing that warlike weapons especially the frontes which serue in the place of Gentlemen, must haue a faire Corslet, with all the péeces appertaining to ye same, that is the curats, the collers, the poldrens with the Uambraces: also the long taces the burganet, with Swoord and Dagger, their Pykes of the vsuall length (for the strength of the battaile doth consist in the same) bearing the pykes on their shoulders, setting their thombs vnder the same, whereby it is ruled.
They must oftentimes practise to traile, push, warde, couch, crosse, &c. as for the necessitie of the skirmish or battaile appertaineth.
THe&se be gards vnto Captaines and Ensignes, which bée most times chosen Gentlemen of experience, who as occasion serueth, giue order to the numbers in aray, approching the enimie to the assault, certeine of them bee oft appointed to aduaunce and maintaine the same: whose discrete leading and valiaunt courage dooth much comforte the rest to followe the same.
These bee armed with Corslettes, and bée placed in the heart of the battaile, vsually called the slaughter of the field, or execution of the same, who commonly doe not fight but in verie great extremitie.
Thus bee the Souldiers, with the great foure weapons armed and furnished to seruice conuenient to be trained and exercised, as heereafter followeth.
CAptaines hauing their bands furnished with officers, souldiers, armour, weapons, munitions, as aforesaid in times conuenient, resorte wholie together to some ground necessary to muster, march, and traine, exercise, and instruct such as are not perfect in the feates of warre, which bée ordered sometimes by wordes and déedes, as by signes from the officers framed, that souldiers may learne and obserue the meaning of the same, as héereafter shall more plainlie appeare.
At such times of assemblie, as at watch or warde, the Clarke ought to read the bill, and to call euerie souldier by his name, that euerie man may answere for himselfe, and none to be absent vpon paine without sicknesse or license.
The Sergeant as they be called, putteth them in araie that euery man follow his lodseman, kéeping his ranke fellowes iustly on both sides, placing the shot in voward and rereward, the ensigne and billes in the middest of the pikes: So be they placed in beautie and strength, as is accustomed, sometimes to stande and aduaunce their weapons, turne their faces, march any waie assigned: sometimes to receiue a worde that shall passe from man to man from the one ende to the other, with such silence that none heare the same, but those in araie assembled.
Sixe principal points belonging to the souldiers of all estates, as heereafter doe followe in order.
IN all places of seruice such silence must be vsed, that soldiers may heare friends, not be heard, as well in watch, warde, ambush, camisado, or else where: in which pointe consisteth oftentimes the safetie or perdition of the whole Campe.
Such obedience must bée vsed, that none regard the persons, but the office to them appointed, diligentlie obseruing the same, anie offending to the contrarie runneth into daunger of the Lawe: for longer then obedience is vsed and mainteined, there is no hope of good successe.
Souldiers must be secret and haue regard that they disclose nothing, though sometimes they vnderstand the pretence of the higher powers.
In sobrietie consisteth great praise to the souldiers, who vsing the same, are euer in state of preferment.
Such regard their duties, and reproue the rash busie bodies.
The Captaines and Souldiers of courage hardie, be to seruice much auaileable, specially such as will ponder what may be the end of their enterprise.
Some in times past haue hardly giuen the onset, and after repented the same, but the praise of the aduised cannot be expressed.
The vertue of goodnesse and truth is farre excéeding my capacitie to write, the practisers of the contrarie, are not worthy of life, but to bée soone adiudged.
Subtile enimies approue to corrupt souldiers with gifts: but sith the reward of truth is euerlasting life, and the vntrue looseth the fruitio~ of the same in continuall darkenesse, trust none of our countriemen will learne the one for the other: from the which God kéepe all good souldiers.
Heere begin the Articles wherevnto all souldiers which serue vnder Emperour, or any other King or Prince, ought to be sworne vnto, and them to keepe and maintaine inuiolated at all times, and in all places, vpon such paines as follow.
FIr&st, yée shall be sworne to be true, iust, and dutifull to his Lord and souereigne, and his graund Generall or chiefe Captaine of the field, to be tractable and obedient vnto euerie officer placed and appointed to rule ouer him, and to be readie both day and night to serue, whether it be by land or by water, as occasion of seruice shall fall out and require.
And whosoeuer doth repine or sheweth disobedience herein, of what degrée or condition so euer he be, he must be dulie punished by the iudgement of the superiours appointed for that purpose.
Item, if there be any which shall blaspheme the almightie God or his diuine word: let such a blasphemer be punished with the losse of his life openlie, and to the terrour of the rest let it be executed.
For no doubt the plague of the highest will not depart from the house or tent of the blasphemer.
For how should wée vse iustice indifferently vnto men, when we are content with silence to suffer such iniurie to be committed against God? Therefore first straightly punish the offences done against the liuing God, and hée will send thée wisdome better to iudge the causes betwéene man and man.
Item, whensoeuer any chieftaine or Captaine of any band, shall vpon vrgent causes appoint in his absence any other whome hée shall thinke good, to supplie and execute his roome of Captaineship, euery man ought to follow and obey the said deputie, with no lesse care and diligence then they would the Captaine himselfe, vpon paine of such punishment as the Generall or his assignes shall appoint.
Item, that all souldiers must content themselues with their places appointed, béeing ioyned togither in bandes, or seuerall without resistance, whether it bée in marching, watching, incamping, or besieging, béeing also commaunded therevnto by the Captaine or other officers, vpon such paine as shall bée thought good by the Captaine.
Item, that euery souldier shall for his honour sake, gladly fauour, and mercifully forbeare vnto the vttermost of his power, all women lying in childe bed, or béeing with childe, or lately deliuered from childe, to defend and succour them from the rage of the cruell and rude souldiers or others, which followe the campe for spoile.
Also it behooueth all Souldiers to defend all Ministers, Priestes of godly calling, and all spirituall persons.
But now a daies they be the first to whome abuse is offered, of what opinion or religion so euer they bée: but God no doubt, will iustly plague all such before they bée aware, and when they least suspect it.
Also they shall defend all aged men and women: neither shall any molest and hinder them: if otherwise, vpon paine of losse of his or their liues.
Item, that euery souldier shall serue, and is by the lawe of armes bound by long custome to serue thirtie daies for euery moneth, and after that rate hée shall receiue his moneths wages.
Item, if that any souldier haue receiued his moneths wages afore hand, or any part thereof, and departeth without leaue or pasport from his Captaine, hath not serued for it, he or they apprehended, shall for the said offence be iudged to die.
Item, if there be any souldier or souldiers in marching breake his or their raie without iust occasion enforcing them, then the Prouost marshall, Lieuetenant of the band or Sergeant shall compell him or them with violence to kéepe his or their rankes in order: and if so bée that he or they so disordered, do chaunce in this case to be slaine, there shall no man be blamed by his or their deaths by the law of the field, for by such disordered people the whole armie may be in daunger of ruinating by the enimie.
Item if that by the appointment of the chiefe rulers of the hoast there be a battaile fought, and that by the mightie power of God, the victorie be obteined on your side, the lawe of armes is such, that if any souldier hath receiued his moneths wages afore hand, he shall be discharged of the same, neither shall he serue any longer for the said wages, after the day of victorie, neither shall owe any thing for it, but he shall be set frée from that moneths seruice.
Item, if it chaunce that in time of skirmish or in any other conflict with the enimie, some one do aduenture to flie and runne away from his fellowes, if in the flying, his Captaine or any other souldier by shooting at him, or by striking at him chaunce to kill him, they shall incurre no daunger for so dooing.
And if such a flier chaunce to escape at that time, and afterwardes bée taken, let him according to the lawe of armes suffer death for the same: for one such a recreant may bee the ouerthrowing of a great multitude.
Item, it standeth with the lawe of armes that each common souldier shall bée sworne that they wil not haue amongst themselues anie priuate counsels, assemblies or conuenticles, vpon paine of the losse of their liues.
Item, there shall no souldier neither in time of marching, nor during the time of their incamping holde or kéepe anie whispering or talke, or secretlie conuey anie letters vnto their aduersaries, without license from the chiefe Captaine vpon paine of the losse of his life.
Item, if there be anie one or a more number that shall goe about anie treason or anie other conspiracie to be committed against the campe or garrison, such a traitour or conspirator shalbe accused vnto the Knight marshall, and he that bewraieth and accuseth such an offendor shall haue for his reward a moneth wages or more: as the facte is hainous, so the rewarde is to be increased vnto the partie that reuealeth the same, and the offender to receiue the reward of a false traitour.
Item, that no souldier shall bée suffered to bée of a ruffinlike behauiour, either to prouoke or to giue anie blowe or thrust, or otherwise wilfullie strike with his daggar, to iniurie anie his fellowe souldiers with anie weapon, whereby mutines manie times ensueth, vppon paine of the losse of his life.
Item, if anie one beareth hatred or malice, or anie euill will for anie occasion done vnto him, so striketh him, he looseth his hande, if otherwise he séeketh reuenge, then by lawe he looseth his life.
Item, if anie souldier bee warned to watch or warde, and he doe not come, hee shall bée punished at the discretion of the Captaine, but if anie souldier bee summoned to watch, and hée appeare, and after the watch woord giuen, and the watch set, he departeth, and leaueth the watch, such a one shall without mercie bée punished with the losse of his life, neither shall anie man set an other to watch in his place without the leaue of the Captaine vpon paine of his life.
Item, that no souldier or souldiers draw his or their sword or swoordes, or vse anie other kinde of weapon with violence to doe hurte within or without the campe, during the time of the warres, vppon paine of death.
It hath lately béene vsed with more fauour of life, as such an offender to loose his hande, but it is the discretion of the Lord chiefe Generall, in whose handes lyeth both life and death of offenders, after their arraignment and iust condemnation.
Item, the like lawe is against the officer and officers of anie band in the campe, if he strike anie souldier without such occasion as is permitted him in the articles to doe. Item, that no person or persons presume to be mustered or to take wages before hée be sworne to be faithfull, and trulie to serue his Prince in those warres present, vpon paine of death.
Item, that the Harold at armes shall proclaime publish all that the Generall shall giue him in charge in the place and places where hee is commaunded, and not to adde or diminish anie part or parcell thereof vpon paine of death.
Item, there shall no souldiers or other men, procure or stirre vp anie quarrell with anie straunger, that is of anie other nation and such as serue vnder one head and Lord with them neither in their gaming or otherwise vpon paine of the losse of his life.
Item, there shall no souldiers or other person, béeing in campe or march, take away anie thing from anie man béeing their friend by violence or by deceipt, as their victuals or other necessaries vpon pain of the losse of his life.
Item, when that there are anie victualls carried or brought vnto the campe no man shall run out to take anie part of them before they bée brought to ye appointed place for the purpose: no though they offer for the~ more then they be worth, vpon paine of the losse of his life.
Item, if that the Prouost martiall, haue at anie time taken an offender, and according to his office he carrieth him to bee punished, and if that one or more souldiers séeke to rescue the saide malefactor, and in this sturre the offender escape, hée or they that are the occasion of this escape shall be punished with the like punishment as the malefactor should haue béene, whether it bée by life or otherwise according as the waight of the crime requireth.
Item, if there bée anie founde, that hath entered his name vnder two Captaines, and hath taken wages, armour and weapons before hand, such a person shall bée taken for a periured man, and shall by the law of armes for the same loose his life.
Item, if anie that hath a place appointed him by the harbinger or officers for his tent or lodging, hée must hold himselfe content withall, neither shall he molest anie man lodging within his tent, or other lodging at anie time for anie occasion vppon paine of the chiefe Captaines displeasure, and such punishment as hée shall thinke most fit for the offence.

Item, at the first warning of the drum or secretly, all souldiers must bee in a readinesse and resort to the place appointed, which commonly is the market place, from thence in order of araie to the enimies, as they bée commaunded vpon paine of the losse of his life.
Item, al souldiers being horsmen or footmen, must diligently in order of aray by sound of drum or trumpet, accompanie the Ensigne to watch, ward, or reliefe of the same, being the silentlie in a readinesse to the enimies, as occasion shall serue to brute the alarum with the vsuall woord, Arme, Arme, or Bowes, Bowes, vppon paine of the losse of their liues.
Item, all souldiers must kéepe their armour and weapons faire, cleane and seruiceable in a readinesse at euerie sodaine, none intermedling but with his owne, euerie one to helpe other to arme and diligently to resort to the place of seruice at scrie and larum vpon paine.
Item, all souldiers must honestlie intreate, and trulie paie vitlers artificers allowed for their reliefe, being friends or enimies, and with curteous words encourage such to vittell relieue the companies or campe vpon paine.
Item all souldiers, in watch, ward, march, or otherwise shall haue speciall regard, that if there be man or woman desirous to speake with the superiours, or being thine enimies for feare do forsake his owne power and resort to thée, let such secretly be conueied to the Lord chiefe Generall, regarding that they viewe no secrets, least they be double spies vpon paine of the losse of their liues.
Item, Captaines and officers must oft frequent resort vnto the souldiers lodgings, to sée in what state their armour and munition be in, to giue great charge that their furniture be alwaies in a readinesse, their corslets with all péeces belonging to the same, and their caléeuers be made cleane and oiled, to haue match and pouder drie, the stringes whipped for their bowes, their billes and halberds to be kept sharpe.
Thus oft they ought to viewe the same vpon paine.

But euery one ought to be in the night with their and not to be deuided from their lodgings, that occasion seruing they may be ready with their weapons in their hands, neither ought they to lodge watch or scowts, or of the search, for that the spies hauing no lodging any excuse being found out, may the better be apprehended, also if the scowte watch, be taken from their quarter, faining to be a soldier of the Campe when they are to spie in the night, they for so offending shall be cruelly punished with death.

Item, that no souldier shall goe out of the campe in the night time without the watch worde, in daunger of his life, for if he be slaine so by the watch, there is no blame to be laid vpon them that kill him.
Item, there shall no souldier go out of the campe without his armour and other weapons, vpon the paine of the losse of his life.
Item, euerie Captaine shall be sworne, that he shall charge euerie decurion or Captaine of ten men, vppon their othes that he shall denounce euerie souldier that is vnder his charge, and that is not able and méet to serue.
Item, in like case if the said decurion shall receiue anie newe or straunge souldier into his band, his part and dutie is, that he giue vnto the higher Captaine knowledge thereof.
Item, no man of what condition soeuer he bée, shall be so bolde as to conueie or attempt to conueie any offender vpon paine of the losse of his life.
Item, that euerie souldier shall haue vppon his outermost garment some speciall signe or token whereby hée maie bée knowne, such a one as the higher Captaines shall agrée vppon.
As for example, hée shall haue on his garment a red crosse, and vppon his armour a red lace or such like, whereby he may the better be knowne of his fellowes, and if there shall be anie found without the said signes and tokens, he shall bee vsed as an aduersarie or enimie.
Item, if anie Captaine or other officers shall procure skirmish or fight the battaile, without commandement from the higher officers, for so offending they shall receiue death.
Item, if that anie number of souldiers bee commaunded and placed by the head Captaines to defend or kéepe anie citie, tower, castle or fort, or anie other place, and they béeing sharplie assaulted by the enimie, once, twise, or oftner, in this case the lawe of armes is, that the Lord Generall shall allowe and paie vnto such a number of souldiers but ordinarie wages, neither is there by the lawe of armes any thing more due vnto them, and if the said Castles, Towers, or Fortes shall be sold or bée betraied by the said Captaine, officers, or souldiers, or otherwise yéelded without the commaundement of the Prince, or at the appointment of the Generall: shall be as false traitours vsed.

THe&se Articles must bée openly read in the presence of the chiefe Captaines by the notarie or scribe of the court, and after that it is read, the oth shall be ministred vnto euery man by the pretor in this wise, or the like wordes, to the same end and purpose, speaking vnto the whole companie, and saying.
My brethren and friends that are héere present, ye haue héere heard the articles of the Quéene our souereigne, conteining the chiefe principall points of our rights and lawes of the field, and of the oth, and the manner thereof, which euery souldier ought to take.
All you therefore that doo meane faithfully and valiantly to obserue, mainteine, fulfill, confirme, and kéepe the aforesaid articles: let him héere now either openly refuse to be a souldier, or with me hold vp his finger and say after me.
ALl these Articles which haue béene openly read vnto vs, we hold allow as sacred and good, and those will we truly and stoutly confirme, fulfill, mainteine, and kéepe, so helpe vs God and his diuine word.
These Articles with others, which for tediousnesse omit, would be published, some vpon paine of death, some greater, and some with lesser punishment, to euery one that doth offend, without any remission or forgiuenesse, or regard of bloud, degrée, kindred, or frendship, specially at the beginning to lye in Campe, whereby the army may the better be set in good order, and to make it fearefull of God, of iustice, and of the Generall, with loue and feare.
The execution héereof onely apperteineth to the Maister of the Campe, for the hearing, ordering, and determyning of causes of iustice vnder the Generall, as the Liuetenant of a Citie or Towne, Deputie for the Prince.
For the Maister of the campe is the chiefe of the orders, who hath place in the Field in many things, as principall next to the Generall, who hath the chiefe gouernement in pitching the Campe, and dislodging: briefly, from the Generall downeward, it is the greatest charge and burden that is in the Armie, and therefore it is requisite, that hée haue good knowledge and remembrance of all the orders whereby the warres is to be gouerned, and that he be of good practise and experience.
But such cases as are capitall and of great importance, should bee heard and determined by the Generall and his Iudges, it sufficeth that God is the knower and determiner, and next vnto him his ministers on earth, who failing to doe iustice, either for zeale, loue, or hatred, shall yéeld account thereof before the diuine Iudge, and this law cannot be auoyded by vs, but we shall be cited and called by way of appeale.
How Captaines according to their worthinesse are preferred to great charge.
SOme Ensignes haue in times past ben accompanied with one hundred, some with two, some with thrée, some with foure, some with fiue hundred men, according to the worthinesse and experience of Captaines, of which all were not throughly except at the first, the better to traine, exercise, and order such numbers to seruice appertayning.
Here followe certeine perticular practises in proportion by letters, signifying men, from one hundred, vnto fiue hundred, in quadrant or battaile, to the greatest strength for defence of enimies, shewing euery weapon particularly in their place and order, to march any waies to seruice conuenient, or els to kéepe the ground of aduantage, as winde, Hill, and Sunne will permitte, in which consisteth great profit.
Certaine words to be vsed of the Captaine, in time of trayning.
AT such times as the Captaine or any other officer determine to exercise their company to traine them, they must cast them into a Ring, or such like necessary, and to vse these words vnto the souldiers, saying, as after followeth.
My louing friends and fellowes, we be gathered together, being also appointed to serue God and our Prince, and to defend our countrie to the death, and for that none through ignorance shall perish or runne in daunger of the lawes of the field, ye shall from time to time by mée or the officers of my band, be instructed by words or déedes in such pointes as to our calling and the necessitie of Seruice shal require, the which you must diligently obserue and followe, though such to you many times séeme both daungerous and painfull.
Also if any of you my fellowes shall find an occasion conuenient to declare to mée his minde and opinion in any thing, touching seruice, will diligently heare, and gratifie the partie the double value thereof, and God willing will vse equitie and iustice with the same.
Also regard, that all Souldiers knowe and obeye their Officers in their place, according to their calling.
Heere are set foorth certeine points, to traine, exercise, and in order to place one hundreth men, three in a ranke: also how to bring them into a Ring, an Esse, or a Snaile, very profitable for young Souldiers.
AS before haue set foorth what number of weapons ap+perteineth to euery band fro~ one hundred vnto fiftéene hu~dred men: euen so to march thrée in a ranke, thrée thirty rankes containe one hundred men, suting your weapons in this order following, that is, in the front or voward
Billes to gard the Ensigne, and next your Bils your other twentie pikes, and then your other
shot, the which béeing thus placed, may by your Officers be brought to these proportions and orders as followeth, greatly auaileable to diuers Seruices.
FIr&st, for that a C. is the least number that a Captaine hath in charge, will therefore begin with one hundred, the which after you haue taught to march
in a ranke, right foorth, you shall bring them in this proportion of a ring, otherwise called a limasson: And although it is not of any force, it is necessary to traine the vnperfect, also by bringing them in close co~passe together, they may better heare and vnderstand any precepts touching their charge spoken by the Captaine, or any other officers as oft as is méete.
This is not of force, bicause the Ensigne lyeth open to the enimies, without gard of Pikes.
SOmetimes vpon good occasion you shall bring your pikes in order of an esse, your billes placed in the midst with the Ensigne, whereby it may bee enuironed with Pikes for defence of horse, your shot placed betwéene euery ranke of Pikes, so that they may serue to the skirmish either rescuing other within gard, the which retiring into the voyd place, the Pikes couched euery way for defence, the ouerplus of shot with the Captaine and Liuetenaunt with other officers to be placed in the midst of the Esse, with the Ensigne.
[Figure: An Esse. the Vowarde the rerewarde SOmetimes vppon the sodaine, bring them into this order of a D, otherwise called a Snaile.
Place your billes and Ensigne, in the rereward of your Pikes, and cast your selfe round, so that you may enuiron your Ensigne, place your ranke of Pikes, the Shot betwixt euery Captaine, Liuetenant, and other officers, with the ouerplus of shot to be placed within the weapons.
This is a strength at néede, but in this order they can not march or retire.
[Figure: D, or, a Snaile. the rerewarde the How to traine your men and bring them to the vse of their weapons.
in a ranke right forth: likewise to kéepe their order in limitation or ring, you shall commaund your officers to teach them how to vse their weapons.
First deuide your shot from your Pikes and Bils: causing a marke to be set vpon the water, whereby you shall the better perceiue where the Pellet falleth.
Then cause your Drum to goe before, and your shot to follow single, teaching them how to hold their péeces, and to put pouder into the Pan, the Match into the Cocke, the better to bolden them, and those that haue experience to discharge at the marke, euerie one for to follow his lodesman.
This done, cast them all about round, and bring them to the place where they began, then afterward teach them to discharge with pellet.
Then must you deuide your pikes and billes in two parts, commaunding your officers, that they turne their broade sides, as if they should encounter the enimie, causing your drums to sound.
Then charge your officers to goe in the front of your pikes, to showe them howe that they should vse their weapons, as first, to cause your pikes to sarie close together, then to traile their pikes with the sharpe ende toward the enemie, two yards from the ende of the blade, and to offer the push one at an other.
This being done, cause your Drums to sound the retrait, that is, to retire with your faces vpon the enimie.
Then must you teach them to warde with their pikes, when the push is offered against them, also to couch and crosse, for defence of horse: likewise to aduaunce, as hereafter shall more plainly appeare.
Here beginne certaine orders and practises to traine or place an hundred men.
The first THis showeth howe the hundred men before mentioned, cast in a ring, may march thrée in a Ranke, the whiche may bee brought vnto these proportions of strength following.
SOmetimes marching in the Raie aforesaid you shall deuide the same into thrée parts by
rankes in each part, deuiding your shot into foure partes, and your Pikes into foure parts also, placing your Billes to gard the Ensigne, so be they ready at the sodaine in quadrant as appeareth.
in ranke, to the intent when néede serueth to ioyne vnto other bands.
In thus marching, place halfe your shot before, the other in the rereward.
in ranke, placing your Bils in the rereward, with your Ensigne, the which maketh a iust quadrant, placing your Shotte in the wings and rereward, as appeareth.
in ranke the which is the greatest force that a hundred men may bee brought into, place
in each wing, the which seruice very aptly to skirmish, is greatly vnto the anoying of the enemie, also readie to retire to serue round about the battaile, the Pikes as before.
IF in marching you vnderstand or perceiue that horsmen will assault you, then place
Pikes in ranke, and betwixt euerie Pike a shot, so marching forward, they fall to be
ranke quadrant, placing your billes and Ensigne in the midst.
rankes of Pikes euerie waie, your Shot next vnto them, your Billes and Ensigne in the midst, the Pikes endes couched on the ground, the better to defend the enimie.
THis proportion sheweth the March or Quadrant order at large of a C. men, verie necessarie to bee vsed.
In showe to the Enimies, when thou vnderstandest their numbers to exceede thyne, placing seauen Pikes in the Voward, also
Pikes in the second Rankes, your Billes and Ensigne in the midst, with the Dromme and Fiffe as is before mentioned, the which nomber when thou perceiuest the Enimie, to take vewe of thyne, thou shalt cause the second Rankes of the Voward and Rereward to steppe forwarde to furnish the voyd spaces, the which shall make of seauen thirteene in Ranke.
Also if thou perceiuest the enimie pretending to encounter thee, hauing no place of refuge, shalt cause the Rankes that stepped forwarde to retire to their places, and to sarrie close together, remoouing out of the second Rankes into the wings the Bills, to step forwards in their places, will bee seauen euery waie quadrant, as in the order before is mentioned, your Shot to bee placed in the Voward and Rereward, may skirmish and retire as occasion serueth.

Certaine practises for them that haue charge of two hundred men to seruice conuenient.
Rankes conteine two hundred men sueting their weapons as before: may be brought to these orders following, to diuers intents auaileable, although the same for a time séeme painefull, and although Archers be not as heretofore they haue bene, yet it is good to showe you, that hauing Archers you must place them as afterward to you is mentioned.
The second SOmetimes diuide the Pikes and the Billes into three parts, by fiftéene rankes, seauen to a ranke, placing your Ensigne in the midst, so ioyning them together, maketh a herse battaile, readie at the sodeine against the enimie, placing fortie Caliuers in the voward, and twentie Archers and ten Caliuers in the rereward with thirtie Archers.
LIkewise according to your ground you shall place your outtermost rankes with your best and fairest Corslets, the which serue not onely to the show, but otherwise for the strength of the battaile, commanding your officers to place ten in a ranke, the rest to march ten in a ranke, likewise your Billes and Ensigne in the midst, falleth to be ten euery way quadrant, the which is a iust hundred, your Caliuers placed in the voward and rereward, and your Archers in the flankes which is a iust hundred also.
The fourth SOmetimes by commaundement of the Generall or head Officers, you shall be commaunded to doe some exploite by night, the which beeing lead by your Guides through straites, wrong grounds, woods, &c. it is needefull that euery Pike man and Bill man take holde of his Lodsemans weapon, placing your shot betwixt your Pikes and your Ensigne in the midst, your Pikes to march fiue in Ranke, sixteene rankes is iust eightie pikes beside your Bils, the ouerplus of your shot to be placed in the rereward.
SOmetimes occasion serueth to marche through long Brome, Corne, or Ferne, so that Souldiers must traile their pikes fro~ the ground close together at the halfe pikes, in the Voward the sharpe ends of the pikes forward, and in the rereward the sharpe ends of the pikes to the ground, who may of the sodaine being assailed with horsemen, must presently aduance and couch their pikes euerie way for defence of Horse, your Caliuers in the front and Rereward, the archers in the flanks.
ALso when you shall bee called to the assalts of Towne, Fort, or any such like, you must endure the great shot if it bee not dismounted, wherefore your officers must cause them to march a good distaunce a sunder, and euerie man close to his Lodseman, march with expedition, and manfully employ themselues vnto victorie, your Caliuers in the Voward, your Archers next to your Pikes.
Certaine points to exercise and traine three hundred men vnto seruice conuenient.
men that be expert in seruice, may oft times victoriously accomplish Exploits and points of seruice to them committed, which great numbers vnperfect may not attaine vnto.
The better to instruct the same, here followe certaine orders and strengths in araie, which practised in time conuenient, may bring perfection of seruice at neede.
in Ranke, may be brought to diuers points of seruice conuenient
The second To bring this number into a quadrant proportion, you must diuide your long weapons into three partes, placing foure in ranke, your Billes and Ensigne in the midst, and ioyned close together fall out to be
quadra~t euery way, your shot placed in the wings ready to skirmish, in the body of your battell are sixe score Pikes, thirtie billes, and in the wings seuen score and ten shot, in the rerewarde thirtie shot, thus is this number at the sodeine brought to strength against the enimie.

ranks, your shotte placed in the Voward and Rereward as the ground may serue, is a herse or broade square.
By these exercises of augmenting ranks as do appeare, Souldiers may bee brought to perfection of order in aray, and by the same bee brought to perfection in quadrant or hearse, according as numbers and ground will serue.
SOmetimes the Captaines with your bands aforesaid, be appointed to some exploits with such silence that Drums sound not, nor clap Weapons, neither vse any noyse vntill they haue recouered the place conuenient for their enterprises, yet sometimes the officers in the rereward sendeth a word passing from man to man, vntill it come to the voward onely, from one ranke vnto an other, which may bee said Sarre aduance or such like, appointed two or three ranks of gentlemen skilfull Souldiers to leade the voward, knowing the encounter to ioyne, that waie by order of the officers, the shot doth issue to skirmish betwixt the leders aforesaid.
The Battaile may ioyne close together if occasion requireth, also the rest of the shot may wade through to helpe the voward.
in ranke, with your Billes and Ensigne in the midst, so it falleth out to be
in length, placing your shot in the front and rereward, the which as occasion serueth, may be brought to skirmish any waies.
This same Battell as the ground serueth, is verie strong against the enimie.
Sometime marching in straights, especially hauing some gard in Rereward for the safetie of the Ensigne, you may send certaine Rankes or Pikes vnto the Front towards the enimie, which shall wade through to strengthen the battaile, placing the one halfe of your shot to the skirmish in the front, the other halfe in the Rereward.
SOmetime hauing scope of Grounde, standing in doubt of Horsemen, cause the numbers to march
in a Ranke at large, a good distaunce asunder, and so to stand still, euerie man towards their quarters, placing their Shot on all the sides betwixt the Pikes which after they haue discharged, being charged with horse, may retire to the Billes, and your outward Fronts serue close together, vntill the Shot haue charged, and at the repulse of the Horse, to open your Pikes at large, and the Shot to be co~maunded to skirmish as they were in the fronts.
C. men may be brought to this quadrant proportion against the defence of the enimie by placing
in the Flankes, your Billes and Ensigne in the midst, placing your Shot in sixe wings for the rescuing of each other, the rest of your shot in the Vowarde and Rereward in Diamond wise.
This Battaile for so small a number is of great force.
[Figure: The like number placed in manner of an hearse or twofold Battaile.
THe ground may be such as it shall be necessarie to place the same number in maner of a Hearse, or twofold battaile, placing
in breadth, placing your Bils and Ensigne in the midst, encountring the enimy on your broade side, so shall you occupie more handes, then the quadrant battaile doth, occupying lesse ground in marching, then the other battaile.
You must cause them to tarrie close together, trayling their Pikes on the ground, beeing ready to offer the push to the footemen, and to crosse for the defence of the horse, your shot to be placed, as before you appeareth.
This is of great strength, so that the Enimie cannot enuiron you.
ACcording to the worthinesse of the Captaine, the greater charge is committed, as one Captaine to haue charge of
C. men vnder one Ensigne, the which to bring into quadrant Battaile, you must place
rankes quadrant, placing your Bils in the middest with your ensigne, so haue you lift the body of your battaile
men, your shot to be placed in the front and rereward
wings, the which being charged, may dischage and retire whereby to be rescued by the lest: they may in this proporiton march any way vnto them needfull, be it either to trauaile, or els for to winne grounds by any aduantage.
[Figure: To place the like number in an hearse or square Battaile.
SOme time by reason of the ground it is necessarie to bring such a number into an hearse or twofolde battaile, which may bee more auailable then the quadrant battaile.
To bring them into this present proportion, you must place
in length, your Bils and Ensigne in the middest, your shot in the Fronts and Wings.
Thus in order they may turne their faces, and march any way to them needefull, which practise may greatly auaile at neede, as vnto great numbers apperteineth.
Thus leauing to treate any further of priuate bands, here following will shew some points, and necessarie practises to great numbers, conuenient to order, ioine, and imbattaile.
¶In this booke is conteined certeine necessarie practises to bee exercised with such handes and regiments, as vnto Coronels or Chieftaines, to be committed, to many exploites of seruice greatly auaileable.
SVch appointed to the leading and gouenment of numbers aforesaid (with their bands suted) weapons as accustomed The Captaines and Companies bee vnto them obedient and obserue their commaundements to all intents, as if the Lord Lieutenant Generall were present.
And for that Captaines with their bands the better and more easily may bring their numbers into such order or battelles, as the Sergeant maior, by the Coronels or Chieftaines commaunded must do, hereafter ensuing doth follow proportions to the assistance of the same.
And for Caliuers, whose practise in the Skirmish be the first in the field, and beginneth the fight, the letters following in diuers proportions signifie such, and shew to march, skirmish, inuade or retire in politike maner, as to such doth apperteine, as well by bands diuided in sundry parcels distantly in sunder, as either may rescue other, as also to retire by ranks rescewing as aforesaid.
And considering how by inuentions dayly deuised, the exercises and subtelties of the same doe daily increase, to the great perill of the vnexpert, as we may dayly see, these sundrie proportions following vnto some vnknowne, may in times conuenient be exercised to bring to perfection such smal numbers, so to profit in greater numbers, which the vnperfect cannot accomplish.
[Figure: Certeine necessarie points for to be exercised with numbers of Caleeuers and Archers to diuers intents of seruice in the field.
THis number vppon the sight of the Enimies must march three in a ranke, casting themselues in proportion of a Ring, so to abide there, appointing themselues to approche still in araie, there to discharge by Rankes, so in the Rereward to charge readie to seruice againe, marching round.
THis nomber encountering the ring must discharge by rankes, and after the first ranke hath discharged, to retire betwixt the Rankes vntill they come to the rereward, there to charge and followe his looseman to seruice againe.
Thus may you continually mainteine skirmish how little or great so euer your number be, it giueth great incouragement to the souldiers standing but one shot and retireth.
[Figure: Orders of shot verie necessarie for diuers intents of seruice in the fielde.
Theswo bands change tanks, and place on their broad sides.
[Figure: These bands of Archers be brought to seruice by the Caleeuers afore them.
THese two bands of calleuers set to recounter the enimie on their broad sides, the fro~ts discharge and turn their faces, retiring betwixt the other, which aduance in like maner to ye reseue of the same.
Those retire charge againe to seruice, thus practising the skirmish may bring the bands of archers to seruice, to the great anoying and discomfiting of the enemie.
These bands of archers being brought to seruice by the calleuers, although that the calleuers be counted to be of greater force the~ they be of, the archers be not vsed in the field so much as they haue bene, yet hauing light shafts made to shoot or score, may kepe their place shooting altogither ouer the heads of the caleeuers, to the blemishing and very great anoie of the enemie.
[Figure: Orders of shot verie neccessarie for diuers intents of seruice in the fielde.
These two bands discharged by rankes, and return to the rereward, and charge againe.
in ranks like two hornes are to be brought to skirmish in proportion, like as doth appeare, the fronts or voward dischargeth, the one retiring on the left hand, the other on the right hand vnto therereward, and there to charge againe, euery one to follow his lodesman vnto seruice againe.
[Figure: Orders for shot verie necessarie for diuers intents of seruice auaileable, The seauenth.
According to the number of the Enemies you must aunswere them with like proportion and numbers, hauing great regard to obtaine hill, winde, water, wood, &c the which greatly auaileth, sometimes the aduantage of grounds is such that small numbers way repulse greater numbers.
The grounds large and plain, make your maineward of shot larg strong, the better to aunswer the enemie, the fro~ts to discharge and retire to the rereward, there to charge againe, and being thus ioyned in skirmish with the enemie, the Captaine and officers must foresee the best waye to repulse and ouerthrowe the enemy, sending two winges to flanke the enemies to encounter them the which being wisely foreséene will greatly profit.
[Figure: Orders of shot verie necessarie for diuers intents of seruice auailable.
These three bands marching at large maie wade through in skirmish, or retire betwixt the rankes as occasion serueth either band rescewing other, to charge in the Rereward, and to aduance to seruice againe.
These practises and such like exercises in times conuenient may bring perfection to seruice with shot at need, the rather through the good industrie and painefull trauaile of officers and the souldiers by whose gentle patience it is sooner obtained.

Against horsemen they must pitch their pikes on thn ground and crosse them, and against footemen beare aboue hande.
They must sarrie close together, and not disseuer to followe or flie, least their disorders make place for Enimies to enter, as by this proportion doth appeare.
Sometimes for the safetie of our shot you must receiue the~ within the gard of your Pikes.
This .h. signifieth horsmen galloping the field to breake vppon you, where they may best enter, and most easely, as by the void space arpeareth, the ouerplus of your shot to be placed in the
CAptaines marching with men vnderstanding by scout or spie that the enemie pretendeth to skirmish with them or otherwise to ioine baitaile, you may deuide your bands in three parts, marching
in a ra~ke placing Officers betwixt euery band, that being assaulted may ioine the Voward and the Rereward to the middle ward, so fall they out to be an hearse battaile, placing your shotte in the winges, that they may the better resorte to the skirmish, likewise to retire as occasion serueth.
This is a singular good order for the obtayning ef any grou~ds or doing of exploits.
[Figure: An order to imbattaile the like number in quadrant proportion at the sodaine as if the Sergeant Maior were there present.

Three hundred men bearing Caléeuers in the Wings, thrée hundred in Demie Diamonde wise, after the Alm aine maner in the midst, the which being discharged, the Caléeuers will greatlie preuaile.
This way they may march wholie togeather, or retire any waies to seruice néedfull, readie with their shot to encounter the enemy any wayes in skirmish, either wing rescuing other as need shall require.
And although the Sergeants Maior appointeth order for the same, yet the Sergeants of euerie Band hauing experience, only ruleth and giueth order to their owne charge, and appoint and place such in the fronts, Rereward and wings, as to them séeme most conuenient.
THis proportion is after the Almaine maner of imbattailing, much like vnto the order of the Romanes who deuided their Legions into diuers cohorts to this intent, that when the Fronts were wearied the Maineward and Rereward succeeded, hauing by late experience in Fraunce tried, that the deuiding of the Battaile in many Bandes, so that they haue Pikes sufficient to impsle the Billes, and to euerie Bande their number of shotte and horse, is more auaileable then anie battaile being made of a whole bodie, or as the Gréekes tearme it, a Phalange for they are to be out of length or breadth as the grounde or occasion serueth, to charge and encounter the enimie placed in one battaile, of euerie quarter to their great detriment, and ouerthrowing of anie so placed, being of sufficient strength for defence of horse: and though the first or second, or third, should be ouerthrowen, yet the rest kéeping their order are to succeede.
Whereas the battaile being one, after the Fronts be ouerthrowne, the rereward is readie to run, the which being disordred, can hardly recouer to place them in order againe.
This waies you may march or retire anle waies that shoulde bee thought needfull to the doings of anie exploits.

The thrée omost ranks faire armed, and skilfull gentlemen and others, doe pitch their pikes on the ground couching and crossing the same, the two ranks next giuing the push at the length of the pikes, the shot placed within the pikes for safegard, shoote and charge still in their places.
This order to encounter with footmen if it bée possible will recouer the aduantage of winde, hill, and Sunne, in good order, on the one side of the hill to ioyne in fight, where God giueth the victorie before these same encounters.
Reuiue your souldiers with meate, drinke, and good counsaile, and with comfortable wordes to animate and encourage the same.
AS before haue set foorth the order or imbatteling of me~ in two fold wise, yt which in some grou~d is much auaileable, for yt it occupieth more hands the~ yt iust square in fiight at one insta~t, notwithstanding such must be assured yt the enimy can approch but one way, which els may be preiudicial therefore in the plain field the iust sqare or quadrant is, the strongest order yt may be, neuertheles co~uenient it is at such time as you purpose to ioin battaile with the enemie, hauing ordinance other cariage to ye same in the wings of the rereward, thereby to impale the same yt the enemie enter not but in the fronts.
Also the expert captaines must foresée to obteine hill, winde, Sun, or anie other aduantage, the which diuers waies greatly profiteth.
If your battail be assaulted with horse, then couch crosse your pikes, and against footmen sarrie close, trailing your pikes vntill the encounter, then to offer the push till repulse be giuen, and God giue the victory.

[Figure: THIS TABLE SERVETH TO PVT IN ORDER OF BATTAILE LONG OR SOVARE, ON HORSEBACKE OR ON FOOTE, OR TO NVMBER Enimies so placed: also to tile or or measure ground of like portion: also what ground serueth to encampe euery one of the long or square Battailes.
THis present fourme of battaile, which represents a quadrant, hath bene often vsed as very profitable of many Italians, well experienced, and of great credite in the field: it is as it doth appeare, flanked and enuironed with twoo greate bodies or sléeues of Hargubusiers, the which containe in number for each flanke

men, the which to be brought to this forme, you must place
in ranke for the length, the Captaines, Lieutenaunts and Sergeants, as before you is mentioned, and the Chieftaines in the heart of the battaile.
And although this manner or forme giueth scope to moue which way they list, yet hold it best, not to suffer them to stirre much.
And that little mouing which is to bee graunted to them, must not bee ouer hastie but in pace flowe, sober, and well measured, vnlesse he hath to set against the like battaile of the enemie, for then the last rankes must be somewhat quicker in stirring, and to bring
or to this order readily, they must in setting forward, march with maniples well seuered and deuided, which manner is very readie to be compassed with ease.
But to place them in length, dubling the ranks, bringeth them likewise to a very formall order of battaile: of which haue sufficiently spoken, in the office of the Sergeant maior, in the first booke.
Battaile in forme of a Crosse, very necessarie to be vsed, as well in the night as by day, because all the weapons are deuided by themselues.
THis Battaile in forme of a full Crosse, consisteth of
fronts or faces, whereof euery one is accompanied with Hargubusiers, which may in tyme of necessitie bée couered and defended by the armed Pikes, so that the formost rankes be moued by the flankes and sides.
It is a gallant battaile, and of force sufficient to resist the enemie in open field, albeit setting vnwares, and besides superior both against horsemen and footmen, the Hargubusiers are
These Hargubusiers being deuided into fower parts, must be in euery flanke

the which are to be placed on euery quarter of the Billes
euery waies, the which make a iust quadrant of people, so that there remaine to bee placed by the Sergeant maior
This rule may serue in proportion for any number being very excellent for the night, because each weapon being deuided by them+selues, may be readie at the sodaine for any seruice, either to giue battaile, or for defence of the Campe, the horsmen and the field péeces to bee placed as shall seeme best by the Chieftaines or the Sergeant maior.
[Figure: The Battell called a Crosse, verie excellent both for day and night.
[Figure: THE BATTELL IN FORME OF MOONE, BEING OF GREAT FORCE FOR THE NIGHT.
An excellent order of incamping, if thou standest in doubt of the enemie.
THis square battaile in forme of a Moone is very co~uenient and fit to be executed in the night tyme, for yt there being appoynted any Chieftaine whatsoeuer, which may place the first companies that come to him, at the Ensigne in order before assigned, and the great Sergeant the~ receiuing them, and from hand to hand parting them into seuerall companies, in maner as this forme shall require, it is ordered very easily, and it is no great matter to deuide the weapons without confusion: either to march, or otherwise to vse themselues seuerally from the rest, more or lesse as it shall be néedfull, for that euery weapon doth stand at his owne defence by it self, as first the Artillerie, next the Ensignes, then the Billes, or Holbards, and in the outtermost circle, the armed Pikes, which may vpo~ the sodaine hy the Sergeant or the Corporalles of the fielde, be brought to any other forme of battell: also the great Sergeant may place the Hargubusiers in so many companies and so many formes, and so much distance one from another, as the situation of the place doth either bind him to, or may seeme to require, to the end that the principall square may be best defended and flanked.
And for that the purpose of this forme is easie enough of it selfe to be vnderstood: also for that haue more largely spoken of it in the first booke in the office of the great Sergeant, will no further intreate thereof, aduertising withall, that euery battaile in square forme, this or other, that must bee ordered in the night, aboue al must prouide that it haue placed euery sort of weapons by themselues, that thereby confusion may be auoyded, and besides they may call foorth to seruice any companie presently vppon any necessitie that may befall, aduertising that good watch and scoute be kept on horsebacke and on foote, as néere the enemie as is possible, and to giue aduertisement whereby you may knowe what is best of you to be done.
IF any Generall or Maister of a Campe, Coronell, or Sergeant Generall that hath charge to conduct an Hoste to march from one place to another, it is requisit, that if he haue not experience of ye countrie himselfe, that he carrie such as haue experience, that he with them may consider well of the scituation and place, whether he is to goe with his Hoast, as through Plaines, or néere a Hill, or by Hilles, or on Vallies that haue Hilles on both the sides, or by Woods, or néere to a Wood, or els where a Riuer is néere.
It is also requisite that some of the light horse, as well for discouering the enemie, as otherwise to take the breadth of the straights and passages goe before, and to make certificate that according to the breadth the Hoast may march.
And put case, that one part of the way be fiftéene foote broade, the Hoast shalbe made to march by fiue in a ranke, because euery footman will haue three foote in breadth from shoulder to shoulder, sixe foote in length betwixt ranke and ranke, and one foote for euery person, so that
foote in breadth, and two myles in length, wil containe an Armie of ten thousand men.
After the same reason whether there be twentie or thirtie thousand footmen, according to the measuring of ground by the foote they may bee set in order very easily, neither can the leader bee deceiued when he knoweth how many armed men euery place can containe.
And after the same order as the place doth inlarge, he must enlarge the rankes, causing part of thy Shot to goe before the aray, and part behinde, and other to goe in succour of thy Horsemen that goe in viewing the passages, and the Ambushments, with the whole doings of the enemie: and let an other part be for a vaunt+gard and retrogard to the ray, to bee able to serue them at néede, and an other part to go alwaies at the flankes of the ray, the which if there bee Ditches, shall serue as a against the Horsemen of the enemie, and if they be men at armes, they must march on both the sides of the Battaile, and also of the Hargubusiers that doe march by the flanks of the Battaile, and the Lighthorsmen to serue for Scowtes both before and behinde the ray.
Also there be abundaunce of Labourers to make places plaine, and to cast downe Ditches and Bridges, and to make defences and other necessarie things that are required in marching, the which must bée garded by your Lighthorse and Shot, and when you depart to fayne to goe to some other place then that you go to, and if there bée no men at armes to appoynt to euery Regiment certaine Hargubusiers to serue on Horsebacke, the which may serue in stead of men at armes, and when occasion serues to serue on foote agayne.
It is requisite that all Souldiers followe their Constables and leaders, and haue great care and diligence in marching, to the end, that by sodaine assaults they bee not at euery steppe to rise in a rumour, and confusedly to runne here and there, and the one to goe contrary to the other, and finally comming about them, not to be able to do any thing of any profite.
For which cause thou oughtest to march with thyne Armie through euery place in battaile ray, whereby the Souldiers may bee made more apt and spéedie to make a voyage, and quicke and readie to resist if néede shall be.
They hauing learned to followe the Ensignes and attend to the commaundements, and to behaue themselues valiantly, according to their place and order, if thou march in a plaine Countrey, it is requisite that thy Pikes march in battaile ray, retyring thyne Armie into a little space, so that by the straightnesse and facilitie of inlarging, thou be not constrayned to extend thy selfe into too much length, which fashion of marchings seemes to giue power to the enemie to assault commoudiously their aduersaries, and according to the occasion to hurt them, he knowing to bee taken from them the commoditie to defend themselues, forasmuch either with more largenesse comming against thee, the which is wont to happen both the hornes being compassed, it is like that he shall easilie disorder and put thee to flight, or els giuing charge on the flanke in the midst of thy battaile, hauing alreadie broken thine order, sodeinly stop thy men from being able to goe forward, being closed in the araies of their enemies: wherfore mynding to retyre in a mayne battaile, and to turne to resist, they shall bee able to doe little good, as those that haue vsed such a maine battaile, which for want of thicknesse is nothing strong, but altogether weake.
Also if the enemie should charge thee on the Rereward, thou shalt be brought to the very same necessitie, because thou shalt bee so compassed as thy fronts shall not be able to succour the last, or the last to succour the first.
For the which thing it is alwaies better and more sure and easier, to gouerne the bands that march, close and square, then thinne and long, especially, forasmuch as to an armie that marcheth long, oft tymes happens that of some thing seene doubtfull and vncertaine, there groweth sodeinly feare and terrour, because sometymes it hath chaunced that men descending from high and hillie places, into the plaine, to places expedite and open, and the formost seeing the last of the same band by a great distaunce to come after, supposing themselues to bée assaulted of some Ambush of enemies, it hath bene seene, they haue sodeinly turned to fight, and afterwards no otherwise then enemies, with their owne companyons, gone together by the eares.
The victualles, the cariages, and all the rest of prouision, iudge should bée placed in the midst of the armie, that without great daunger such things may bee caried and conducted after the armie: but if it shall be otherwise the hindmost part would be garded and defended of the most valiant Souldiers, as in the fronts, because that at vnwares may happen many things, thy Lighthorsmen going before inuestigating and spying where they may passe, hauing occasion to passe by Mountaines, Woods, places closed with Hilles and most great Desarts, because the enemie many tymes by oportunitie will lay an Ambush priuely by the passage to assault his aduersarie, which little thereof taking heede, hath easily broken and brought them to vtter decay, the which Ambushments if the conductor by way of explorators shal foresee with a little paine, hauing preuented the counsaile of the enemie, may get him a most great name of prude~ce, and likewise saue his Armie.
And as for the Plaines thou with thyne owne eyes maist see a farre off, forasmuch as in the day dust moued and lifted vp into the aire, doth shew the mouing and stirring of the enemie, and in the night the fires and flames signifieth their Camp to be nere.
When thy men are to be conducted and not to fight, thou oughtest to remoue by day, if peraduenture some thing do not constraine thée, for the which thou thinkest it good to goe in hast to come before thyne enemie, where in déede for such occasion thou mayst remoue by night; so that thou knowe it may safely bee done to fight with the enemie.
Leade thy men not in haste but softly, and inforce them not to make too long a iourney, forasmuch as labour taken before men doe come to fight, is seene most oftentimes vaynly to consume and wast the strength of their bodies.
And marching in the Countrey of thy frends, it is néedfull to commaund thy souldiers that in no maner of wise they touch or marre any thing, but rather altogether to refraine, considering that Souldiers hauing weapons and libertie to doe what shall please them, will fauour nothing, especially, for that the sight of things that please men, out of doubt is woone most daungerously to leade ignoraunt and vnwarie men to desire them, and with the swéetnesse of robbing to entice them to all manner of mischiefe, whereunto if thou prouide not, thy friends and thy confederates for verie small occasion will become enemies.
Notwithstanding, the Countrey of thyne enemies, thou shalt suffer thy souldiers openly to destroye, burne, and consume, because by the dearth of victualles and lacke of money, Warres are woont to diminish, and bee extinguished: and contrarywise through abundance and riches they are nourished mainteyned, but first before thou suffer thyne enemies Countrey to be destroyed, thou shouldest giue aduice to thyne enemies, threatning them what thou wilt doe, if they will not yéeld vnto thée: for that the perill of the miserie prepared, and the feare of ruyne looked for, ofttymes constraines men to graunt many things, the which at the first by no maner of meanes had bene possible to haue brought them to passe, but after they haue once receiued the hurt, they will make little account of thée, and despise al other things as though thou couldest doe them no more harme.
Albeit if thou knowest surely that in the Countrey of thyne enemies thou must tarrie long with thyne Armie, suffer to be taken and spoyled those things onely which thou seest not to bee greatly profitable vnto thee: but the same which is to bée thought may bée preserued for thy commoditie, commaund openly to thy Souldiers that they forbeare.
Hauing made readie and set in order thy men, tarrie not long in thyne owne Countrey, nor yet in thy confederats, least that consuming all thy prouision, it seeme not that thou art of greater hurt to thy friends then to thyne enemies, but rather conduct quickly thyne Armie into thyne aduersaries countrey, whereby it be fertile and abundant, there may bee taken at thy neede most plenteously those things that thou list: but if it be otherwise, thou shalt cause to be knowne, yt thou séekest to prouide most louingly both for the wealth profite of thy friends.
Besides this, thou oughtest to care with al diligence that marching or incamping by sea or land, victuals maie safelie be brought, forasmuch as by such meanes the marchants with all dilligence will bring all things, whiche for the vse of an armie shalbe necessarie.
Moreouer, when thou must passe by straights, or march through rough and hillie waies, then is it co~uenient principallie for the preseruation of thy things, to send before shot on horsbacke and on foote, for the kéeping of those places, rocks, or inclosed waies, least the enimie taking it before thee, maie both let thy passage to thy great hinderance and losse: the contrarie thou oughtest to inforce thy selfe to do, when thou vnderstandest the enimie to passe, the like thou hast not onelie to take heede for receiuing harme, but to enforce thy selfe to turne against the enimie, those deceits whereby he thought to deceiue thee.
And when thou purposest to goe against him, it is requisite to prouide before him, and at vnwares oppresse him.
So diligentlie thou oughtest to prouide to lette him euerie waie if thou vnderstandest that he intendes to pursue thee.
Of the order of the march in figure, and of the placing of the weapons.
FOr somuch as there are diuerse formes of marching, soo thinke it good to note this onely one set downe in figure, as verie necessarie and of greate force for an armie with his whole carriages to march with all: wherein partilie imitate the antiquitie, as otherwise the order now vsed, as for example, let there bee an armie of.
horsemen, according to the proportion set downe, there is allowed to euerie hundred footemen, fortie pikes, fiftie shotte, ten billes, the which falles out to be
holberdes, the which with the horsemen are to be diuided into three battailes: the Voward, the Maineward, and the Rereward battaile: In the Voward shall be placed
In the front of the Voward battaile are to be placed.
Launces, then there are to bee placed thy piners who are to be garded with
shotte of each wing, the Sergeaunt maior must giue in charge that these Piners beate downe and make plaine the ground before them in their march, in such breadth as occasion shall serue to make your battailes, or necessitie procure, or the straightnesse of the place permit, also the Sergeant hath to appoint these Piners that if they be charged by the enimies, hauing their weapons to defend themselues amongst the shotte: or otherwise to retire themselues by the winges of the battaile, and to be placed at the discreation of the Sergeant maior in the battaile, next after the Piners shal followe

Pikes, after the Pikes the carriages of the merchaunts, and puruaiers, who must by the appointment of the Generall march armed for the defence of their charge, then followeth the other
shotte, and if you passe through any daungerous places, it is requisite so to march as you may sodeinly bring them to a quadrant battaile, sending alwaies before.
Hargulaters on Horsebacke, and an hundred light Horsemen for vancurriers: to discouer and viewe the straightes and passages: as otherwise to take the breadth and to giue certificate to the officers whereby they maie make their march thereafter, and to viewe that all places be free from ambushes and traines of the enimie, whereby the armie maie the more safelier and quietlier passe, sending from the frontes as necessitie require aide to assist the curriars, then must followe your maine battaile of footemen, the which is
Holhardes, the which are to be diuided in this manner, next vnto the shotte of the Voward battaile must bee placed the carriages of the maine battaile, with bagge and baggage, who must bee placed by quarter, then foure thousand Pikes, next the Pikes.
Holberdes with the Generall in the middest, then the other foure thousand Pikes, after the Pikes the carriages of the merchauntes, the weaponnes of the Rereward battaile to bee diuided as in the Voward, who must send foorth corriers from the Rerewarde, to espie whether the enimie doth prosecute thee to take aduauntage to thy hinderaunce or no, and you must place next your shotte in the Rereward one thousande Launces, and two thousande pistolaters, your.
shotte of the maine battel are to be placed as wings to al your battailes, who must be plast a sixtéene paces from the sides of the battels.
Next vnto the shot must goe the artilerie of the field with their carriages, with like distance on both the sides of the battailes, then must bee placed.
The Generall must giue in charge that in all daungers till the footmen maie bee brought to forme of battaile, that the ordinance and artilerie maie bee redilie and equallie diuided in the two hornes of the battaile, to terrifie the enimie to the vttermost, and if so be that the enimie will attempt the battaile on the wings, lette the hargulaters with the rest of the horse and shot in the wings make the like defence, thus euery part shall be of like sorte defended vntill thou hast made thy battels as pleaseth thée: if this order cannot please thee, to march withall, through a suspected place, you maie practise that whiche the wise Captaine maie best like of: or according to him that shall haue the authoritie of the field, not thinking it amisse in noting this order in figure, with the diuision of the weapons, for that beeing well considered, and with aduise well ordered, you, maie make presentlie as many battels as you will, and in what order you please, euen by hand, without anie greate trouble, or businesse of braine. {flower}{flower} The ordering of the lodginges.
NOow when the wise Captaine shall bée come into his enimies land, and that by his politicke gouernment he shall haue escaped all the traines of deceipt which were laid to entrap him, insomuch that he is come to the Walles of anie Citie, there to laie siege: his first care must be, that he be settled there, where he may haue either at their backs some great fenne, some large riuer, or some deepe dale, hauing high pendles ouer it, either cast there by Art, or fortified by nature, or els hee must prouide that hee place them where they maie be defended by some other meanes, as in the top of some hill or vnder some mountaine.
But for the greater safetie of the armie, he shal send before faithfull spies, which shall discouer the coast, and make true report of all they see, in such sort as he doth, which is sette in some promontorie, to watch and giue warning, of whatsoeuer enimies hee shall see to appeare by sea.
But if so bee that these places of strength bee wanting in any place where he shall come, hee must in anie case prouide that hee encampe there, where he maie both hinder all passage, and especiallie of victualls to his enimies besieged: and yet haue free conueiaunce of prouision for his owne armie.
He must vse especiallie in the choice of the Plat, the wise aduise of his companie, as namely of the Maister of the campe, the Sergeant Maior, and other experienced heads of his armie.
And particularly for the Plat it selfe he may follow the counsaile of the Maister of the Campe, the Sergeant Maior: whether it bee commodious for the victualling of the Campe, hee must learne of the chieefe Purueier: and whether it be fit to fight in, he maie take the counsaile of other beaten souldiers: so that all hauing the election of the place both by the benefit of the and the helpe of practise they shalbe lodged in places well defenced, wholesome in aire, plentie in Water and Wood and Meddowe, free of passage for victualls so that the armie bee disquieted by no want.
If in that place in which they are determined to giue the siege, as conuenient to compasse the Citie with the armie, there be anie Pallaice or place of commoditie it must be allotted for the Liuetenaunt generall.
If there bee none, let there be made a square vale of cunning men, well trenched and cast into this forme following, which haue resembled partlie too that of former time, or anie other forme, as the Platte will best beare, or the counsaile of those which are of greater experience herein then I, can better deuise.
But of what sort soeuer it be, it must be such, that the men at armes maie lodge about the Generall, and the Launces about the men at armes, the pikemen about the Light horse, and the hargubusiers about the pikes, according to the manner and forme mentioned in the ende, that when by anie sodaine chaunce either by daie or night, the campe shall bee sette on by the mightie multitude and force of the enimie, especially by night, the hargubusiers and the pikes maie for a while make resistaunce in the head, till the Light horsemen and the Launces with the men at armes haue leasure to arme themselues, and come with the Launces in the front one foote, in manner of pikemen to the Pauilion of the greate Generall, so armed as they they are to trie the vttermost of their strength and courage be, to saue their General and their armie, to their owne honour: which they maie doe verie well, if so be that they wil not sticke to rush vpon their enimies, and with their Launces seruing for armed men, maie encounter with the pikemen, whereby they maie both defend their owne valiantlie, and beat backe their footmen, mauger their force, considering that they shall bee in complet armour and fresht, and their enimies but armed in part, and alredie tired with the hot onset they haue had in the fronts, and beesides the footemen beeing newlie supplied and somewhat refreshed may breake in by the flanke and backes of the enimie, so that they maie repent themselues that they euer attempted an onset to their so great losse, and greater shame, as enforced to flie and forsake their enterprise, onelie by the might and worthinesse of the armed men, wherevppon the armed men, as well bard as light, shall at all times for their great honour, and for the aforenamed necessitie, lodge about their Generall.
haue seene the armed men, and the light horsemen lodged, some at the entraunce of the trench within the banke, and other without, not farre from the ditch of the saide trench: howbeit haue alwaies thought some ouersight to be therein.
But submitte my selfe still to better iudgement, for that if by night as haue saide they shall bee assailed, they must needes bee taken vnprouided and vnarmed, then will they not bee able to make anie long resistance, so that the enimie breaking in vppon them, shall finde the footemen with the Generall, destitute of the defence of the bard and light horse: wherevppon without all doubt, they shall bee killed without respect, or taken prisoners, or otherwise flie from their tents, with their greate dishonour.
The forme of the Campe haue set downe at the ende of this discourse in figure, partlie shewing how the ditch should be cast about the Plat.
The space of the plat must bee agreeable to the quantitie of the armie, which is to bee determined vp the Maister of the Campe, the Sergeant Maior, and the whole counsell.
Wherevpon the greater armie must haue the greater plat, and the lesse armie the lesse plat.
Alwaies prouiding, that the streets for the inner lodgings be made wide inough, aswel for ye ease of the souldier, as for the vse of the merchant and purueier, as also for whatsoeuer sodain chaunce may happen: seeing that if not in order of battell, yet in this double ordred forme, one man may take anothers place, and by that meanes help one another, The ditches shall be paces broad and as deepe as maie be, if the ninesse of the ground, or some hard rocks doe not hinder as it doth about the Trapanian on Sicile.

This largenesse of the ditch is necessarie during the time of anie siege; but especiallie if the armie be incounted in a Plat not well defenced of it selfe, thereby to be safe from al and sleights of the enimie, both by daie and night.
But marching by the waie, there is no such depth nor largnesse required, especially if the aduersaries armie be not in waite too set vppon you.
Howbeit it is good alwaies to lodge safelie, beeing in your enimies land or otherwise in place of daunger and perswade my selfe, that this is a varie profitable forme of lodging, for that if the enimie set vppon them in their lodgings, hée shall finde them ariued and ordered in a quadrant battaile, and flanked on euerie side with and artillerie.
And béesides the horsemen beeing in the midst, the enimie will suppose that all the strength lieth in the head, whereas the horsemen maie come forth armed and set vppon them by the flankes and béehinde, through the benefite and scope of the large streats which are from the North too the South, and from the East too the West, and breaking vppon the enimie thus at vnawares by the flankes and behind them, maie endamage them to their shame and confusion.
It is to bee noted, that the Coronels, the Captaines and other head Officers must lodge about their charge of footmen, to the ende that the souldier in sight of his Captaine dare not doe the thing which honestie will not brooke.
And moreouer there must bee care had that the watch and ward and scouts bee not raised before morning, not that the gates of the Campe, be opened to any, before the Sunne be a good height and the spialls bée sent to view if there be no priuie ambushments appointed by the enimie too endamage thee and doe thee outrage.
There must bee therefore gre foresight in the [Figure: THE PLAT FOR INCAMPING.
Generall to cut off all such places, as be fit to harbour anie scouts or ambushments of the enimie.
This forme of encamping is partlie borrowed of antiquitie, and partlie imitated of the Turkish manner of encamping, in the assiege of anie citie, tieng my selfe alwaies to the memorie of the auncients of former time.
If there bee anie who misliketh this, leaue him to the libertie of his owne iudgement to deuise some other of his owne, and promise him that wil be content there with to do him pleasure, and not in this alone, but in all other things aboue shewed in this worke.
But if this forme like he shall place the footmen, the horsemen, the Merchaunts, the Purueiors, the craftesmen, souldier to souldier, backe to backe, and ridge to ridge, making the lodgings double.
Vppon the banke of the ditch, and in the Curtaines hee maie place artillerie round about and before it for safetie, or els with the carriage of the munition, and the carriage of the whole armie enuiron it for his defence.
In which he shal imitate the Turke, who with the carriage, with the Cammells, and the Artillerie, both inchaine and fortifie the Campe.
Néere vnto the artillerie, he shall appoint the Gunners to lodge, who haue the charge thereof, and after the Hargubusters, and so foorth from hand to hand as haue said.
And further he shall cause the Captaines, and Officers to lodge at the backe of the Hargubusters, hauing his Captaine before him, and the Pikes at the flankes, that euerie kinde of souldiers may be conioined, and not dismembred as it were in their seruice, and from their Captaines: which otherwise will be a cause of greater disorder, and manie discommodities.
An Oration to be made by the Generall, before the Battell be fought.
VAliant Knights and Companions in Warre, most thankfullie accept your seruice, for that you doe offer your liues as true subiects, to accompanie me the Kings high General in the warres: wherein you greatlie show your duties.
For of right you ought too loose your goods, and to venture your liues at the commaundement of the King, and for the defence and suretie of your Countreye, giuing vnto you, not onelie thanks for your companie, but much more for your good counsell, which dailie you giue me.
For in great conflicts, seldome is found together both good counsell and stoute hearts, minding not too enterprise this battell in hope of mans power, for then had you reason wee should not giue battell, seeing the great multitude in respect of vs.
For as you saie, the waightie affaires, of a publike weale, should not bee vnaduisedlie committed too the vncerteine of Fortune: the which hath caused the King my Maister to apoint me in this daungerous and perilous warres.
First, trusting that on our part there remaineth Iustice, and sith God is the same onelie Iustice, trust assuredlie he will giue mee the victorie in this perillous conflicts, for Iustice auaileth princes more that they haue, then the men of Warre doe which they lead.
Wherefore sith our cause is iust, and that we haue God the onelie Iudge thereof on our sides, mee thinks no worldlie feare should make vs cease to giue the battell: for should show my selfe to be of small faith, and also blaspheme God, saying, hee were of small Iustice, for God sheweth his power there, where the frailenesse of man hath least hope.
Then since by the King our Maister and Gouernour, we are appointed and procured to come to this warre, haue determined my most louing Companions and fellow Souldiers to enter in battell, and valiantlie to aduenture my life with you: and if perish therein, shall be sure it shall be for the saluation of my soule, and the memorie of my person, for to die through Iustice is not to die, but to change death for life: and thus doing, if loose my life, yet loose not my honour, and all this considered, doe that which to my Prince and the am bound.
For to a Prince it were great infamie and dishonour, the quarrell being his owne, should by the bloud of others séeke reuenge, minding this daie to trie in battel, whether the pleasure or will of the liuing God bee to giue vs victorie, the which maie bee a warning to others of the great wrong offered vs: if otherwise he suffer vs to perish, the ende of the sword of the enimie, is but the scourge of our offences.
The best see therefore in this matter to be done, is that we confesse our selues vnto the celestial God, preparing our selues to receiue our redéemer, euery man to pardon and forgiue his brother, if hee haue done wrong or iniurie vnto him, for oftentimes though the demaund of the warres be iust, yet many mishaps befal therin, through the offences of those which pursue and follow the same.
Now each thing accomplished as behooueth according too my saying, then let God dispose things as hee shall seeme good.
Wherefore my louing, valiant and stout Souldiers, doubt not at all, for this daie must either vanquish mine enimies, or els suffer death: and if die do that which néeds must.
Wherefore will now cease to exhort you any more, desiring you most louingly to consider that, wherevnto your dutie leadeth you, remembring that you are come as Knights, and in the defence of your Countrie to wage battell, beeing now come to that pinch, that deedes must more auaile vs then words: for peace ought too bee maintained by the tongue, but warres ought to be atchiued by the sword.
THe oration being made by the Generall, and praiers finished to the immortall God, it is requisite that thou haue care too bringe forth thy armie to the field with bright and shining armour, which easilie maie bee done, by giuing charge in time to the Captaiues, and so to the officers, that their burgonets, corslets, enleeuers, holberds and euerie other peece of armour: forasmuch as the cleannes and brightnes of the weapons, maketh the armie séeme terrible, and putteth feare and trauell in the minds of the enimies.
Then call forth thy bands, the which being set in araie, the Generall beeing expert, hauing seene the preparation of the enimies, giueth in charge too the Sergeant maior and the principall corporalls too accommodate and ordaine his souldiers in battaile according to the armie, the men, and the manners of them.
And if the enimie bee more puissant of horsemen: thou hauing the commoditie, choose thee straight and difficult places, or at the foote of mountaines, and where the horse cannot easilie serue.
If in footmen hee exceedeth, then it is requisite to get the hills and places of aduauntage, as the Sunne and winde, &c. and that with diligence to choose such fit places, whiche either bee neere Rockes or Riuers: and aboue all things, where thou maist put in araie thy battailes, and by the qualitie of thy place be able to let thy enimes, that they neither compasse thee about nor inclose thee, the which requires not onelie the counsaile and prudence of a wise Captaine, but the counsaile of the most expert in the camp, because oftentimes an Armie hapneth vpon such places.
And notwithstanding the Captaine ignorant how to choose such situation of ground as is best for him, but of those that are present it is good to choose the best, and to foresee which maie bee most profitable, is surely a signe of a wise Captaine: Caius Sulpitius, to feare his enimies got a great manie of mules and other beasts vnprofitable for the warres, causing a greate number of sackes to bee gotten, which were so ordered vppon the backes of the beasts as they seemed men at armes, giuing in charge whiles he was a fighting they should appeare vppon a hill, whereby grew his victorie against the Frenchmen.
The Spaniards to ouercome Amilcar, set in the fronts of their battels, cartes ful of towe, drawen with Oxen, that béeing readie for the encounter, they set it on fire, causing the Oxen behementlie to thrust forwards into the armie of the enimie deuiding the same.
Thy number small, and the fields large and open, it is good to make ditches, the which being filled with bowghes and slightlie couered with earth, leauing voide spaces for thy horse and shot to procure skirmish, the which being of the enimie encountered maie faine a running awaie, and béeing prosecuted by the enimie, shal be ouerthrown in the ditches, where they are easilie slaine, manie such notable diuises by wise Captaines hath beene practised, the which vppon the sodeine put in vse, will greatlie profit.
Thy battels beeing made and set in order, it is requisite that thou leaue the ward within the trenches of the Campe for the defence of thy lodginges, munition, and carriages, least the enimie vnderstanding the place to be left voide, send his souldiers to take the campe, and so to spoile all: vppon occasion some Captaines will destroie their owne lodgings, or els passe riuers, or leaue beehinde them hils and deepe places, to the end that the souldiers standing constantlie maie ouercome the aduersarie and obtaine the victorie, or otherwise altogether to perish, for that if they should thinke to saue themselues by running awaie, they shall see by all manner of meanes taken from the possibilitie to escape.
Now beeing come to ioine battaile, with thy enimie, cause thy souldiers somewhat before, to flourish oft their naked swords and holberds against the Sunne, for that yt glistering of the weapons, and their shining poynts, through the brightnesse now of the one and now of the other, against the resplendant beames of the Sunne, doth shew a certeine horrible terrour of warre, the which will strike a dreade and feare into the mindes of the enimies.
Likewise it is sometimes requisite that thy battailes goe forwardes with rumours and showtings, sometimes running with violence, forasmuch as the semblaunce of such things with the noise of trumpettes, drummes, and greate ordinaunce, wonderfullie troubleth and feareth the heartes of the aduersaries, also it is greate wisedome in a Captaine, not with desire to be drawne to be the first to giue the onset, but to staie thee neere thy trench till thou hast viewed thy selfe and the remedies of the enimies: that is, how manie battailes, how they are placed, of what condition, and where they are disposed too fight, for after this manner thou maist more commodiouslie see to thine affaires: considering whiche of thine thou hast too sette against those of thy enimies, and in what manner thy men are to bee ordeined and placed, dooing in like sort too a good Phisition, the whiche considering first the infirmitie, and knowing the cause, commeth afterwardes too giue remedie, therefore ordeine thy men so as maie tourne moste vtilitie too thy businesse.
battailes, whereby ensueth manie perilles and discommodities, because the Pike beeing but
yards three quarters long, euerie man occupying a yarde and halfe a quarter of Pike, can occupie but foure or fiue rankes at the most, so that the rest are superfluous, and lost, besides, they are easilie too bee compassed, and too bee charged on euerie side: wherefore haue set downe an order of one of the battailes in figure, according to my opinion, the which if it may turne profit to my countreie, woulde be most gladde.
The occasion of the prosperous successe of the Romaines, was onelye through their good orders, by diuiding their Legions into cohortes, the whiche were bandes of
were armed, their weapons, Pikes, Swoordes and Targets, the which were placed in quadrant manner
battailes in front, leauing a certeine space betweene euerie battaile for their retraite vpon occasion vnto the next order, which were but sixe battailes, and the rereward foure battailes, all in like number, keeping one breadth, the voward were called Hastatie, their battailes thicke and close, the Maineward were called Principie, who had such space beetweene the rankes as they might receiue the Hastatie, the Rereward were called Triarij, whose spaces betweene their ranks, were such, as they might receiue the Principie and Hastatie: on the wings were placed seauen rankes of Pikes, of straungers, whiche did distend in length from the voward to the Rereward, through these good orders they became conquerours of manie countries.
footemen, woulde diuide them into tenne battailes, too euerie one of the battailes shall bee according to my proportion sette dawne
Billes, the which placed in wise according to my proportion set downe in figure will bee in breadth
ouerplus, the whiche are to be placed at the discreation of the Sergiant Maior, the shotte placed in the winges and rereward in maniples for their readier seruice, who must be place a good dista~ce from thy battaile, thy men at armes vpon the wings of the shot, thy Launces as two hornes in the front of thy battaile the light horse in the fronts of thy Launces, the hargulater, in the frontes of thy light horse, who with the pistolaters are the first that begins the battaile: thy great Ordinaunces to be placed in the fronts of the battailes, or in such conuenient place as maie most terrifie the enimie: there would be appointed certeine troupes of Launces, whose guidons would bee contrarie to the rest, the whiche the Germaine calls, their Eorlorne hoope, the French Infans perdus, who must at such time and instant as shall be thought good by the General, giue the charge vpon the enimies battails, whatsoeuer shall happen, who are for the same too receiue double paie.
The second battaile not too bee placed in the front with the first battaile, as the Romaines did, but in the rereward of the first so farre wide and with such distaunce, as the horsemen and shotte a foote giuing the first charge, may retire themselues without disturbaunce to the battells, hauing thy shot placed as in the voward with the launces and shot on horsbacke, the third battel to be placed in the rereward of the second, with like distance with shotte and horse, and so to the fourth, fift, and the tenth, in the rereward of the which, if occasion shall require, thou maist as in the Rereward of the battaile, place for thy defence certeine of thy carriages, thy battailes beeing thus ordered, thou shalt be sure no waies to be compassed by the enimies, whereas thou maist easilie compasse in him, not ordered in the like maner, and thy battailes beeing but little, yet as strong as the greater, being stronglie fortified euerie waies with Pikes, and when a signe is giuen, your hargulaters, pistolaters and launces, may at the sodeine be with the formost, or readie for anie other place of seruice.
Also your second battaile maie ioyne with the first, and the third with the second, and so to strengthen your battailes at pleasure, as otherwise two or thrée of thy battailes to giue the charge to one of his battailes, and if it should so hapen that thy first and second battailes should bee ouer throwne, battaile [Figure: [leaf motif]The Battell in Figure, shewing how euery Weapon should be placed to fight.
plast in this order thou maist retire thy selfe and leaue of the field, mawger the head of thy enimie, who in prosecuting thee, disorder themselues, as manie times happens, maie be easilie conquered, vsing thy battailes in this order, holde to be of greatest and most auailable.
Of the office of a Generall, when the battaile is a fighting THy battaile set in order, the horse and shot beeing encountred, it is requisite that the General vseth some speach vnto the whole armie, without the which many times a whole armie ruinateth, for that his speaking taketh awaie feare, incourageth the mindes, increaseth the obstinants to fight, discouereth the deceipts, promiseth rewardes, sheweth the perills, and how to auoide them: reprehending, praieng, threatening, filling with hope, praise, shame dooing those things by the which the humaine passions are extinct: vnto the Generall it apperteineth rather with wisdome circumspectly to forsée them boldlie to fight, because that his fighting cannot so much benefit the common weale, although he should shew force inuincible, as the loosing of his life should endamage the same, neither that in distresse to refraine from fight, by the which the souldiers maie doe some exploite, but the best is, with prudence to foresee things, and deliberating in times conuenient to counsell the common weale: principallie to the Generall, and to no other is requisite, for as the maister of a shippe forsaking his charge dooing that apperteineth to a marriner, giueth great occasion to the losse of the Shippe.
Euen so the Generall, who setting a part his office of counselling and prouiding of euerie thing to descend so lowe, as to take vpon him the charge of a souldier, should commit the like errour: for through the negligence of superiours becommeth vaine all aid to whome such affaires is committed, the Generall being slaine putteth the commonweale in hazard of decaie, the which beeing aliue, hauing through his counsaile and discreation atchieued felicitie by meane of foresight with reason, hee maie lawfullie glorie: and contrariwise he that is so ignoraunt, arrogant, and couetous, that beleeueth not to doe anie thing honourablie, except he fighteth himselfe is not to be thought, but rather presumptuous and foolish hardie, and hee that will hazard his life to gette him a name of the multitude, whereby to putte those waightie affaires in peril, is very vnméete for such a charge.
But if necessitie constraines thee to fight, it behooueth thee to fight warilie, and not to feare death: choosing rather to be depriued of lyfe, hauing anie ouerthrowe, then to liue with shame, but the armie beeing in safetie, hee ought to haue regarde to his life, for surelie where the death of the Captaine chaunceth, there the happie successe is diminished: for as much as they who haue had the worse vnderstanding their enimies to bee depriued of their Captaine, taketh boldenesse, charging their enimies afflicted with melancholie, for the losse of their Captaine, haue giuen them the ouerthrowe.
Vnto the General apperteineth whilest his men fight, to goe riding about the battaile, and to shewe himself to the fighters, praising those that doe valiauntlye, to threaten the fearefull, to comfort those that bee doubtfull and flowe, to succour them that are repulsed, to supplie the lackes: and if it shall bee needefull to leade men from one place to an other, to obserue times, to take occasions, to make coniecture of thinges to come, and when necessitie procures to giue the signe to retyre.
The clemencie of the General increaseth the loue of the Souldier.
Armour, good order, or late victorie causeth Souldiers to haue a good opinion and sure confidence in the General, and as the loue of the Countreye is increased through a certeine instinct of Nature, euen so the loue of the Generall through vertue more then through anie other benefite.
The necessities bee manie, but that is strongest which constraineth thee eyther to ouercome, or else to die.
THe spoile ought to bee made with great discreation, and that speciall commaundement be giuen, and proclaimed vppon paine of death, that no prisoner be taken except he bée of greate authoritie vntill thou hast vanquished and beecome victor, for oftentimes through the greedinesse and desire of gaine, the order of battayle being broken and dispearsed, the Conquered hath broughte themselues in order agayne and become Conquerours, for vndoubtedlye many times when the enimie flieng seeing his adursaries, comming vppon him without anie order, bringeth his men againe in araie, and turning backeward with standing them with violence, cruellie ouercommeth them, wherefore men must thinke that nothing is better, nothing more safer, nothing more surer, then obseruing order, to prosecute in order, and retire in order, and the contrarie nothing more daungerous, as appeareth by Brennus and Belinus, who beeing enriched by the plentifull spoiles of Italy, returned in disorder and securitie, whereby Camillus and a few of his people beefore conquered, beereft them of the fruites of their conquest.
Likewise Cyrus inuading Scithia, faining himselfe to bee afraide of his enterprise, left his tentes standing, and stored with good cheere and delicate Wines, the Scithians being greedie thereof, hee returned and slewe euerie mothers sonne: the like policie vsed by Thomeris a Queene of that countrie, who withdrew hir selfe into hir land, faining feare vntill she had got them into straightes, where beeing disordered, shee priuilie had planted ambushes, whiche sodeinlie inuaded Cyrus and his hoast, slew them all whiche were.
The like examples in Fraunce and other places could recite, but will not wast time in declaring the mischiefs and destructions chaunced through rash and ouer hastie reconning of vnripe victorie, and vnsure safetie, trusting this maie suffice to warne thee from rashnesse and vncircumspect foresight, to tomble vppon the enimies sword.
Hauing obteined the victorie, humanitie requireth, and christianitie commaundeth, to shew mercie, following the Cannons of the field, hauing special regard that no Princes, Princes wiues or Virginnes, be by filthie lust polluted, for God will see it punished, but imitate the curtesie of noble Alexander the greate, vsed towardes his captiues Darius wife and his daughters, whiche greatlye enlarged and spread abroad his honour, to the furthering of his Conquestes.
Likewise what fortunate successe had Scipio, by his chast hands, in deliuering of Luceius his wife, and honourable vsage of Masinissaes nephew with his great liberalitie, which afterwards bred him continuall seruice of those Princes, before his captiues, with infinite examples which for tediousnesse leaue off.
Graunt not license to thy Souldiers to put al to sacke: hauing regard to the time, and to the state of things, whether thou hast neede to retaine all the pray, or part of the same, or els none at al.
And it is not conuenient if neede require for the common profite, that making warre, the common Treasurie be left without money, for that more amply and largely things may be solde, and with benignitie distributed to them that haue best deserued, hauing regard to the hurt and sicke: but those that haue bene slacke and slouthfull, let him punish most shamefully: and vnto valiaunt men graunt those honours the which of right they ought to haue.
The gifts which the Captaines ought to giue, be Offices, Auncients Armours and Spoyles, and to those that be in authoritie, there would bee greater honours giuen, the which with benignitie and gentlenesse liberally giuen according to the deseruings of euery man, it shall cause encouragement and vertue, for the good to shewe valor, and for the euill through feare, to imbrace vertue.
Of that is to be done after the deedes of armes, and of burying the dead.
HAuing withdrawne thy Souldiers fro~ the field, it is most requisite with al humilitie to render thankes to the immortall God in most solemne maner, the which being done with penitencie and deuotion from the heart: he will vndoubtedly the better prosper thee in all thy affayres, as he did Moses, Dauid, Manasses, with infinite others that put their trust in him: then prouide and with great diligence procure, that the Obsequies be made most worshipfully to them which haue bene slaine in the deede of Armes, for thou shouldest not make excuse, neither of tyme, nor of hower, nor of place, nor of perrill, whether thou ouercome or be ouercomed.
For like as it is a godly thing to performe the Obsequies, and according to the rights to see the dead buryed, euen so it is very profitable for them that remaine aliue, and rather altogether necessarie to shewe to the liuing this thy pitie towards the dead: for surely when euery man seeth the dead bodies as it were for fearefulnesse left in the fieldes, or els for despite left vnburied, they iudge and presuppose the very same of themselues, taking displeasure of such thinges, causing hatred and a vnwillingnesse in the minds of the Souldiers to aduenture their liues, knowing that if they happen to fight for their Countrey and to be slaine, they are not like to be buried.
Wherfore the Generall and principall Officers must with eyes open, see to preuent those mischifes that may insue, as otherwise to render vnto the dead, that of right they ought to haue.
Of the taking of prisoners, and of the vsage of them.
ALthough ye antiquitie hath dealt hardly with their prisoners, putting many to death, yet Christianitie requireth, to shewe mercie, and considering that fortune is vncerteine and doubtfull: and chaunce variable and mutable, the which oftentimes beareth enuie to the happie successe, to minister shame to glorie attained: so during the warres aboue all things, although great occasion giuen by the enemies, extend thy mercie, especially to those that be of authoritie, and bearing office: the which will procure the enemie to minister the like pittie vnto thee: except thou hauing taken many and stande doubtfull of the field, or such as haue dye shot, Onyons, Bakon, Gre or such like, caried to the destruction of than, contrarie to the Cannons and lawes of the field, those thou mayst lawfully kill.
It behoueth thee likewise, if the enemie sendeth not vnto thee, to send vnto him, to know if thy prisoners taken may be raunsomed according to the auncient order of the field, the which is, euery Officer and Souldier vnder the degree of a Captaine, to be rusomed for his moneths wages, and those of fame authoritie render them for some towne or Hold, or els for some such of thy friends being taken, as thou greatly desirest to haue againe.
Good Captaines ought not to let their bands goe long vnfurnished of Souldiers being taken, to their weakning and detriment of the Armie, whom by raunsome and way of exchaunge or other meanes they may redeeme.
Captaines also ought to enquire whether any being taken, and sent home vppon their faith and honour, that at the day expyred, they either pay the money, or els sende them againe vnto their takers, vntill better remedie be found, the which otherwise will breede great dishonour to the Captaine, giuing occasion to the enemie to kill and spoyle so many of his band, as by them afterwards may be take~.
The warres being ended, then with wisedome and deliberation leasurely at thy commoditie, al perill taken away, determine what thou wilt doe with the enemie thou hast conquered.
THE Romaines order and maner, was after Victorie obtayned, and all daungers past and ouercome: that preparation should be made to feast yt whole Armie, and that Tryumphes and Playes should bee made to lighten and reioyce the hearts of the Souldiers, giuing them the better occasion to abide the paines and turmoyle of the warres, and with greater courage to withstande the enemies force: then of such spoyles as the Treasurie haue no neede of, there should be imparted, not only to those of Office, but particularly to euery Souldier throughout the Campe, the which with benignitie would be deliuered as fruits of their labors, gotten with the hazard of their liues, giuing vnto them great thankes for their paynes, true hearts, and valiaunt courage, promising greater recompence.
The warres being once finished, to those in Office and authoritie, there would bee greater rewardes and honours giuen.
IN fighting if thou happen to receiue ye worse, it behoueth vs with great of ligence and policie to finde occasion of reuenge to take away yt shame receiued, as otherwise to put feare out of thy soldiours minds, it is good policy to retaine spies giuing vnto the~ great rewards yt which by politique vsage may be learned ye state, the strength, the order, manners, determination of ye enimies: by which meanes with secret vsage, thou maist many waies haue due reuenge: for that to those that haue newly obtained the victory, haue the lesser care of the enimie, becomming slothfull and rechlesse stragling héere there, kéeping their thinges without forecast, leauing their wards naked, and their watches slender, may with secret approch in the day time, or by camisado in the night time, with valiant couragious hearts be quite ouer throwne, otherwise by a fewe trained out to the skirmish retiring thy selfe faining to run through feare till thou come to such place of aduantage as before thou hast plast ambushes of horsemen, the which shall sodainly approch the enimie disordered and scattered, to their great detriment, as otherwise with thy hands of footmen placed in order of battell, maiest approch thy enimie, yt which séeing thy pollicy, not hauing time to order themselues in the like, will come foorth on heapes, the which being then valiantly charged, may put their state in hazard, through the whych negligence the happie successe before obtained by this pollicie wyll turne thy enimie to great ruine.
POlicy willeth thée not to séeke truce or delaie, but by constraint of necessitie, or for some aduauntage to bée taken: as some aide looked for, or in the meane time to growe into the secréetes of the Enemie, to fifte his purpose, by conference had with hym to vndermine hys dooinges, and if he be not verie wel aduised, to search the state of his force and gouernment, being most secrete and vigilant in these affaires.
Now if feare, enforseth the enimie to take truce, learne by all possible meanes whether it maie turne to thy pro+fit or discommoditie, if otherwise it maie little auaile them, then it may much encourage thy own souldiours The truce being once made, doo not at any time assault thy enimy, nor yet stande vnprouided: although thou sta~dest in such quiet, as if thou hadst peace, but haue as great regard as may be, to the hidden hatred of thy enimie, and wily sleights, that being vnprouided, he assalts thée not vnwares: for asmuch as the mindes of them with whom thou hast made warre withall, be secret vncertaine.
Wherfore make the watches and wardes, as strong as if thou lookedst euery houre to be assalted, giue speciall commandement to al thy souldiours that during the truce no iniury to be offered by them to ye enimy vpon paine of death, by reason of the oath thou hast made in thy couenants to the enimie, the which by no meanes thou shouldest breake or inuiolate, considering that the fruits of falsehood (besides the punishment of almightie God) is euerlasting shame.
When thou sendest to thy enemie, send the most valiant, and noble men of thy armie, the which be in the flower of theyr age, tall, lustie and of goodlie personage, the which in al pointes should bee verie well armed, because manye times it happeneth that the enimy séeing such men as commeth with the Captaine, hath iudged the Armie to be the lyke, beléeuing sooner that they sée, then by reporte.
Precepts and rules of warre necessarie to bee obserued as well for Generall, Captayne, as Souldiour.
Generall ought not to bée cruell vppon victorie, nor insolent vpon good successe, nor timerous of an ouerthrow, but with most moderate magnanimity vpon the respect of occasion to shew mercie to the humble, and to subdue the proude.
Cicero prescribeth foure thinges to be in a gouernour or General, which is experience, valiance, authoritie felicitie, to ye which adde these iustice, fortitude, pollicie and temperaunce, first Iustice to reuenge, fortitude, to execute reuengment, policy to prepare ye meane whereby to reuenge, and temperance to limit and mea+sure out how farre they ought to reuenge.
That Captaine that with such righteousnesse can so rule his souldyers, ye he wil suffer them neither to do wrong nor receiue iniury, but with wisdom wil maintaine them in that which is right, that Captaine must néedes be loued feared of his souldiours, of the whych procéedeth true and vnfained obedeience.
Alexander Seuerus saith, the strength of wars lieth in the Souldiours: whose great vertue consisteth in obedience towards their Captaine.
Obedience in soudiours is nourished by feare and loue, feare is kept by true iustice and equity, looue is gotten by wisdome ioyned with liberalitie.
Xenephon declareth, that the souldiour which first serueth God then obaieth hys Captaine, may boldlie with all courage hope to ouerthrow his enimie.
Thrée necessarie pointes appertaining to souldiours, the one to hearden the bodie to make it apte to paine, the other to teach them to handle their weapons the third to learne them to kéepe theyr orders in marching, as well in ye armie as in fighting or in camping.
As it is necessarie to retaine citizens for horsemen, the country for footmen, so it is perilous to receiue straungers to serue in a cittie, because thou shalt dread two enimies.
Nature hath bread few strong men, but industrie and exercise hath made many.
And armie with labour and exercise dooth profite and preuaile, whereas idlenesse doth hinder and decay.
The choise of ground doth more preuaile then manhoode, and manhoode doth more preuaile then multitude.
He is hardlie ouercome the whych can truelye iudge of his owne and his enimies.
No Counselles better then those which the enymies know not before thou accomplish them.
Bring not foorth thy souldiours to fight the field before thou triest what they can doo. It is better to subdue the enimie through scarcitie and want of necessarie things, then through many assaults to decay thy armie.
If thou wilt know if anie spie be in thy campe or no, send all thy souldiours to their lodginges.
God Captaines will neuer fight the fielde but when necessitie constraines them.
He that disordereth his armie, to followe the enimie, becommeth of a conquerer, conquered.
Sodaine things doo make enimies afraide, where things common are nothing set by.
Offer not to fight the field, except thou perceiue thy souldiours hope of victory.
Alwaies with thy footemen couet to get the hils or high places, so shalt thou accomplish thy exploites the better.
If thou vnderstanding thy counsels are bewraied to thy enimies, then chaunge thy intent and purpose.
Let not thy enimies knowe after what manner you intend to fight, least they goe about to preuent the same by one meanes or other.
That gouernour that prepareth not necessarie victuals is already conquered.
Men, monie, Iron, and Bread, is the strength of the warres.
Practise to knowe a new enimie by skirmise before thou fight the field with him.
When any mercinary souldiours wil leaue the enimy to serue thée, retaine them so they become faythfull, for theyr departure shall both weaken the enimy, and make them fearefull.
In pitching the field, it is better to make many battels then few, for that in making many the enimie cannot imco~passe thée, likewise thou maist make of one of thrée as occasio~ shal serue, otherwise thou maist charge a battel of ye enemies with two or thrée of thine, the which will be to thy great aduauntage.
New and sodayne things makes armies afraide, slowe and accustomed thinges are a little regarded of them.
The same that helpeth the enimie hurteth thée, and that that helpeth thée, hurteth the enemie.
Consult with manie of those thinges which thou oughtest to doo, and when thou determinest any exploit conferre with fewe. With punishments there would be rewardes, wherby at one instant to make the souldiers to feare to hope, as according to the worthinesse of the act, so the reward should be.
As he that fighting saued his Captaine or other souldiours, rescewing them wold be well recompensed.
Also he that first leapt vpon the walls of the enimy, or first entered the campe of the enimie would bée well recompensed.
He that killeth the first enimie, or striketh the first enimie from his horse, consideration would bee vsed. Euerie acte to the counsell knowne perfectlie, would be openly punished, and openly rewarded.
Thus shall good gouernement bée amongest all soldiours and officers, whereby any exploite to bée executed, by this feare and hope shall bée the better doone, and of all men to bée comemnded.

AS for besieging of a Citty or Towne, fortifications, and placing of battery, haue not intreated of, because ye dailie practise and execution of the same, besides the publication therof by many excellent wri+ters, by whome thou mayest receiue profitte sufficient, neither haue written of the offices or training of horsemen, because there is little alteration from the seruice vsed in antiquity, sauing the hargulaters on horseback, the which at the discrecion of the Generall are to skirmish or disorder a battell: onelie their places of seruice in ye field with the battels haue noted not otherwise the varietie of weaponnes and alteration of seruice is onely in footme~: of the which for the great desire haue to the profiting of my country, haue boldly intreated of, trusting that those errors that may happen through default of my writing may bée without harme to any man corrected, the whych are the onelie strength and bulwarke of the fielde, the defence both of horse and shotte, as appeareth by the poore Swizers, who not béeing able to furnishe themselues with Horse, were the first deuisers of the pike and the Squadronnes, who sea red not after they founde the strength and aduauntage thereof to encounter with
footemen, any number of horsemen, whose victories hath caused dyuerse nations to imitate them.
The Romanes what multitudes of horsemen so euer they were to fight against, neuer vsed more then their accustomed number, the which was to footemen, a
horsemen, putting their whole confidence in theyr footemen, as appeared, when they fought against Tigrane King of Armenia, who inuading their Countrey, with horsemen, were encountered of the Romanes wyth footmen, and
horsemen: being of them vtterly subuerted, with many other notable victories, the which the Romanes did, as in Titus Liuius thou mayst plainly sée.
Wherefore horsemen art to be accompted as seconde, and not as superiour or principall of the fielde, because horsemen cannot goe as footemen in euerie place, being slower then the footemen to obey, when it is requisite to alter the order: forasmuch, as if it bée néedefull either going forward, to turne backeward, or turning backwarde, to goe forwarde, or to moue themselues, standing still, or going to stande still, without doubt, the Horse can not doo it so readelie as the footemen.
The horsemen can not béeing with violence disorde+red, returne in their orders, but with great, difficulty, the which the footemen doo most easelie and quicklie.
Besides this it happeneth manie times that a valiant man shall be vpon a vile horse, and a coward vppon a good, whereby it followeth that these euill matching of stomakes, makes disorder.
Neither is it to be meruailed at, that a bande of footmen susteineth al violence of horses, for that a horse is a beast, and knoweth the perils, and with an ill will, will enter vpon the Pike: if you consider what force maketh them goe forwarde, and what holdeth them backwarde, you shall perceiue the same to be greater which kéepeth them back, then that which maketh them goe forwards: for that the spurre maketh them goe forward, and the Pike and Sword kéepeth them backe, so that it must néedes be, that footemen are most inuincible, and superiour to horses.
And if you should argue with mee, that the heate which they come withall, maketh them more furious, regarding the spurre more then the Pike: say, the Horse perceiuing himselfe to runne vpon the point of the Pike, eyther of himselfe, he will refraine the course, turning on the right hand or lefte: or els féeling hymselfe pricked or gawled, will stande still.
As for example, prooue a Horse, and runne him against a wall, and you shall finde fewe with what furie soeuer they come withall, will strike against it.
Caesar hauing in Faunce to fight with the Swizers, caused all his horsemen to alight a foote, to auoide from the Squadrons, as a thing more méeter to flie then to fight.
Footemen being politique hath manie other helpes as by making of Trenches, and as King Henrie at vsed sharpe stakes, whereby hée gotte the Chiualrie of Fraunce.
Or to cause of Iron to be made Galtropes a handfull long, and to be made sharpe like a Triangle, euerie man to haue one of these to throwe vppon the ground at the encounter of the horse.
Besides, the wise Captayne will choose groundes of great aduantage.
And as for the Pistolate is not so much in vse as they haue bene: vsing chéeflie the Caléeuer on horsebacke, the which is nothing comparable to the footeman with the Caléeuer, who will from euery little gall him at his pleasure, besides more readier for anie seruice.
Horses notwithstanding are verie necessarie in the fielde for discouering the Enimies Countrey, and to destroie their forrage, and to burne and wast, all that is not within the fortified Townes, and to kéepe troubled and disquieted the Armie of the Enimies, whereby not onelie to lette them of their rest, but to kéepe them troubled and wearied in the ir Armour.
Lykewise, necessarie for Vancurriers, or for Scowte: and when the Battaile is fought, and Victory obtained they are to ouertake, runne downe, and ruerthrowe the Enimie expulsed.
Wishing thée not to to be drawne with desire to imitat euerie newe seruice, but to obserue the order of the Romanes, vsing thy footemen as thy force, and to euerie Regiment or Battell, a certaine number of horse, wher by thou maiest the better be able to serue against anie Nation, howe, or in what sorte soeuer their seruice bée.
Now hauing finished the Warres, and a full determination of peace concluded: béeing in thy late enimies Countrie, it behooueth thée to haue great care, and with great diligence to retire thy souldiours, from the Enimies countrie, kéeping so good order as if the Enimie would falsifie his vowe made, to take anie aduauntage of thee: yet that hee maie finde thée so prepared and in so good order: as hys wyles shall lyttle endamage thée, giuing great charge vnto thy Captaynes, and so to the Officers, that thy Souldiours straggle not from thy Campe to doo anie outrage, or by violence séeke to take anie thing away, but as they passe the Countrie, honestlie and truelie to paye for that they take, whereby thou maist bée the better thought off of the Enemie, as otherwyse to auoyde all inconueniences, that maie followe.
And if thou art to passe the Countrie of thy fréend, haue the lyke regarde of thy Souldiours, that through theyr dysorder, they make not of a Freende an Enimie.
Being come to the water side, sée yt with all expedition such preparation bée made, for the conuaying ouer of the Souldiours as the Prince so shortlie as maie, bée vnburdened of her great charge.
And against their arriuall sée that monie bée prepared for the present payment of the poore souldiours that they to their detryment, and hinderaunce doo not long remaine vnpaied, whereby theyr heartes may bée hardened and through this default mutinies arise, and many inconueniences growe, considering that at the commaundement of the Prince as true subiects they haue aduentured theyr liues, and in the defence of their Countrie: but it is great pitty, yt fauour dooth so much preuaile, and experience so little estéemed, that so manie be suffered to beare the Office and authoritie of Captaines, whose going to the warres, is rather to bribe and hinder the poore Souldiours, to the dishonour of their Countrie and theyr owne shame, then to merite any thing in the Warres to the profitting of the same.
Trusting that great and wyse Officers in tyme by trying the cause, will sée it reformed.
The Souldiours being paide, it were verie requisite that euerie Captaine shoulde call their companie together, or a little before theyr wages payde: yéeldinge thankes vnto them for theyr dilligence and paines in the Princesse affaires, certefying them that the almigh+tie God no doubt, will prosper them the better in all their affaires.
And where as euerie subiect by GODS lawe in conscience, and by the lawe of Nature, are to be at the commaundement of their Prince and Gouernour, their trauailes and paines in the turmoile of warres hath de clared the same, letting them to vnderstand the warres being ended: the Prince is not further to vse them, exhorting euerie man, quietly to depart into his Country from whence he was prest, or to the place of his longest abode, not looking to make an Art or exercises of armes for that it is not to bee vsed, but when the Prince through constraint shall be inforced to the same.
And when they are come into their Countrey, require euery man to frame him self to such Science, Occupations, Trades or Traffickes, as they haue chiefly bene brought vp with all, accompting themselues most happie that GOD hath deliuered them from the bloodie warres to liue in peace quiet: the which bringeth so many commodities, so many vertues, and so much good as am not able to expresse.
For to make warres to haue peace is Christianitie, and to trouble the peace by making warres vniustly, is Tyrannie.
Now the fruites of the ydle, the which scornes their occupations, through necessitie are nothing els but robberies, thefts and murders, and then Iustice enforced to extinguish them.
Most louingly desiring them not to forget the great daungers that almightie God hath deliuered them from, through the which they were men prepared to dye, hauing the same printed alwaies in their minds, by which meanes they shalbe the better able to see Iustice mainteyned, peace preserued, Magistrates and Officers obayed, and they the better as true Christians, to liue in the feare of God: thus doing, they shall not onely shewe themselues as true and duetiful Souldiers to their Prince, but like the Souldiers and seruants of Iesus Christ, who of his infinite mercie, bring all Souldiers to the hoast of Heauen.
The Generall, principall Officers and Captaines are in conscience bound, to be most earnest suiters and Mediators vnto the King and Prince, for the reliefe, helpe, and maintenaunce of the hurt, lame and sicke Souldiers: being a part of Christianitie to see them comforted, who in the Princes affayres and vnder their conduct, haue receiued their hurts: and that those that haue serued in the warres vntill they be aged, and the maimed, might haue yerely stipends for their maintenaunce, during their liues, and the hurt and sicke to be holpen, at the charges of the Countrey from whence they were prest.
Alexander Seuerus thought that Souldier worthie of his keeping in the tyme of peace, that had truely serued his Countrey in the tyme of warre.
Iesus the sonne of Siracke pitied in his heart the scarsenesse or pouertie of an expert man of warre.
Octauian Augustus erected a Law for Souldiers, that if he had serued ten yéeres in the warres, and being fortie yéeres of age, that he should haue wages appoynted out of the common Treasurie for the maintenaunce of him and his familie, and that the lawfull wife of a Souldier, should bee preferred before other women: and beeing Heroes, it was lawfull for him to beare Armes, and that they should not be chastised, but by Caesar.
Policrates of Samos appoynted liuing for the wiues and children of the souldiers slaine in the warres, straightly commaunding that no man should offer them any wrong.
Solon made this Lawe, that those children, whose fathers were slaine in the defence of their Countrey, should bee brought vp at the charges of the Common Treasurie.
What Nation but England but cherisheth Souldiers, and prouideth for men of seruice, trusting that some noble mindes at the next Parliament may haue in remembrance some of these good Lawes decréed by Emperous, Kings and Princes, whereby some Act may passe for the reliefe and maintenaunce of Souldiers, the which would cause such a willingnesse pristinate valour in English mindes, that no Nation should be comparable vnto vs.
And as there is al diligence vsed for to make men faithfull, peaceable, and to liue in the feare of God, by the Gouernours of warre was doubled: for in what man ought the Countrey to seeke greater faith, then in him who must promise to dye for the same? In whom ought there to bée more loue of peace, then in him which onely by the warre may bee hurt? In whom ought there to hee more feare of God, then in him which euery day committeth himselfe to infinite perilles.
Therefore to such as hath truely and valiauntly serued in the Field with authoritie, would great rewards and dignitie of Offices be appointed, as men most méete for counselling, and the ministration of Iustice.
For as the Poets haue fayned Minerua to bee armed: signifying, that Captaines should bee as wise in counselling, as couragious in conquering: as politicke in keeping, as valiaunt in getting.
And Tullie in his first booke of Offices speaketh of a double commoditie these men doe yéeld to their Countrie: who making warres goe armed, and roabed doe gouerne the Commonwealth.
And as in Genesis it is mentioned, before euer King was, that those were appoynted to gouerne, in whom valiauntnesse and vertue did most abound.
Charles the Great gaue this honour to his Captaines, saying, you shall bee called Heroes, the Companyons of Kings and Iudges of offences.
Wherfore hereafter counsell Kings in the publicke authoritie, and if any doe you iniurie: let him knowe he hath offended the Emperours Maiestie: and if offences be by you committed, we ordaine punishment to bee giuen by vs and our successours Emperours of Rome, as often as you shall transgresse.
And as the vse of warres ought to bee applyed for the defence of right to shield vs from iniuries wherby to plant a commodious state of life, so the studies thereof are to bee vsed in time of peace, for exercise, and in the time of warre, for necessitie and for glorie, and to suffer onely the Commonweale to vse it for an Arte: so likewise as peace is the nourse of store and increase of things, if respect in tyme bee not had for the prouision of Munition, money, weapons and men prepared both in mynds and by exercise trayned for the warres, it wil cause in necessities but faynt warres, beseeching the liuing GOD, that this carelesse liuing in securitie, be not so pernicious vnto the Commonweale, as the detracting of tyme shall enforce vs to take counsaile when it is to late.
The Quéenes Maiestie with her wise Counsell hath made so good prouision of Munition for the Land, likewise of Shippus for the Sea, as no Realme for the quantitie better prouided: but if men be not trayned and exercised for the vse thereof, it will serue to no other purpose, then men taken from the Land, to bee Pylates of Shippes well appoynted in the daungerous Seas.
Besides, her Maiesties prouision vpon euery occasion is not to bee broken, neither vppon a sodaine inuasion easily to bee transported to the hands of her subiects, for defence of her Maiesties Countrey, the which yt Counsell hath wisely foreseene, but their Commissions are so simply executed, as greatly doubt, when necessitie shall enforce to the vse of the same, they shal altogether be deceiued.
The reason is, the Commissions are directed vnto the chiefe of euery Shiere, and by them are appoynted, such Muster maisters as hath good skill in the Law, the flying of a Hawke, or experience in choosing of a fat Bullocke or Shéepe: supposing because we haue liued a tyme in peace, that wee shall alwaies liue in this securitie: despising to craue the assistance of the Souldier, who hath aduentured his life for his Countrie, being neuer so expert or of so good behauiour, because he is poore, and for that a Souldier will not see his Countrey deceiued by their Muster bookes, as to put in so many able Caliuers, so many able Corstets, so many able Billes, and so many able Bowes, the which wil prooue when occasion shall serue to vse them, to bee halfe lame.
meane, because such as are appoynted to haue a Caléeuer furnished, shall passe the booke with an olde rustie Peece without a Flaske, Touchboxe, Martion, Match, Powder, Sword, or Rapier and Dagger: and such as are appoynted to haue Corssets furnished, that is, to haue good Curates for their bodies, Taces for their thighes, Poldrones and Vambrases for their shoulders armes, Burgonites for their heads, good Pikes, and Swordes, and Daggers, these shall passe the Musters with a little olde broken yron of their backs, or if he haue an old Almon Riuet on his backe, although he lacke his Taces, and many other péeces, so he haue a Pike he shall be very wel armed, and yet men of that abilitie as they are, are able some to furnish
men, and keepe them continually in pay: And the Bill men who are appoynted for execution and slaughter of the field, the which of necessitie must be armed at all poynts, these shal passe as men had in no estimation, with a Skull on his head, and a Pikestaffe on his shoulders.
Likewise the Bowmen without Iackes, Skulles, or sufficient Bowes, according to their strengths, with two or three Shaftes by their sides in their doublets and hose, shal passe for able Bowmen: through the sufferance wherof, not only the Queenes Maiestie but the Countrey shall bee deceiued, if it bee not presently looked vnto, trusting the wise Counsell will see it reformed, by assisting the chiefe of the Shiere, with such Souldiers whome experience hath made to knowe what is méetest for men to apparell them+selues withal for the warres: and for that none are appointed but such as are of great abilitie for the prouision of the same, so after sufficient warning giuen by the Muster maisters, as is appoynted for their Furniture, not well oyled and kept for the present vse, if default bee founde either in lacke of such Furniture, they to haue a fine set vppon their heads, the which they should truely pay, and that money to bee bestowed vpon Match and Powder, the which should be spent vpon the trayning day, and that such might be appoynted for the trayning of Souldiers as are knowne to haue experience to instruct and teach them that, that they may profite themselues and their Countrie, and not by fauour to choose such Captaines as are to bee taught by the poore Souldiers, and that consideration by the Countrey for their paines might be vsed: and at the daies appoynted for trayning, the chiefe of the Shiere to be present in their attyre, and to exercise themselues and their horses, with running at the Ring, and such poynts of seruice as is meetest for Horsemen, as otherwise to see the trayning of Pikes and Shot, whereby if election bee made of Captaines not able to instruct like a Captaine, that others might bee appoynted that hath experience.
And if Noblemen and Gentlemen would see these exercises honourably frequented, we should not feare the wicked practises of forreine Princes, to be in hostile oppression, for that those Nations seeing the discipline and martiall prowesse of a state so well gouerned, prouided, and defended, may feare to offer vs iniuries, being glad to desire fauour and league, when things in this good stay and safetie are confirmed and established through this course of life, we shall be most happie, and do our Lord God best seruice, so that our felicitie may hereafter endure for euer.

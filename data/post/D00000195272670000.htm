chronostichon decollationis caroli regis tricesimo die januarii secunda hora pomeridiana anno dom mdcxlviii
ter deno iani labens rex sole cadente carol vs exvtvs solio sceptroqve secvre

charls ah forbeare forbeare lest mortals prize his name too dearly and idolatrize his name our losse thrice cursed and forlorne be that black night which usher'd in this morne

charls our hold lest sense bribe and seduce tame reason to dispense with those celestial powers and distrust heav'n can beholde such treason and prove just

charls our murther'd tremble and view what convulsions this land
court cittie countrie nay three kingdoms runne to their last stage and set with him their sunne

charls our murther'd at fell feinds dire hydra's of a strange whose members spread and swell bigger then their head

charls of great britaine hee who was the knowne king of three realms lie's murther'd in his owne
hee hee who liv'd and faith's defender stood die'd here to it in his blood

no more no more
fame's trumpe shall eccho all the rest in dreadful thunder
such a fall great christendome ne're pattern'd and twas strange earth's center reel'd not at this dismal change

the blow struck britaine blinde each limbe by dislocation was lop't off in him
though shee yet live's shee live's but to condole three bleeding bodies left without a soule

religion put's on black
sad loyaltie blushe's and mourn's to see butcher'd by such assassinates nay both gainst god gainst law allegiance and their oath

farewell sad isle farewell thy fatal glory is summ'd cast upÂ· and cancell'd in this story

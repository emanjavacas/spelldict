TO THE RIGHT NOBLE, MAGNIFICENT, and euer honoured, Syr Edward wootton Knight.
THe grateful remembrance (right Noble Syr,) of your many fauors extended towards my deceased vncle, nothing extenuated towards my liuing Aunte, crauing a supreame commaund ouer my oblyged thoghts, inforceth (where satisfactio~ cannot equally ballance those deserts) an acknowledgement of an euerlasting thankfull mind.
If therefore the hopes of an vntried seruant, may by future merites deserue any liking, or the merits of your own Heroicke worths (whose sole shadow inables my weaknesse) may adde corage to a discoraged spirit, thus to passe the limits of welbecomming dutie: Oh then pardon the presumptio~, that dares choose this means to expresse his true zeale vnto your seruice.
For though the matter nor the methode, befits neither your wisedome, nor authoritie, yet let the innocency of my vnstained soule, be made happie by your acceptance of these fewe sheetes of blotted paper.
if my audacitie (which confesse) haue offended, impute it to proceede by motiue from the praises of your immortall vertues, whose excellencies the shril voyce of fame hauing borrowed the mouths of those, that they, with adamantiue power haue attracted to your affectio~, hath amply propagated through the worlds wide co~tinent.
Or if the matter be impleasing, be that fault attributed mine, in selecting so fabulous a subiect, to be protected by so great a Patron.
But yet (Magnanimous sir) suffer the pleasing inuentio~ for the original language sake, excusing that error, drown the memory of the offence, in the black center of obliuion.
But for the rude stile, harsh vnpollisht phrase, oh there is no comfort can expel that disco~solated fear, vnles the euer memorable noblenes of your grace (thinking me to be what am not) shall (lightning my darknesse) make me seeme gratious in your sight, omitting, and remitting what euer deserueth blame, by smiling on so smal a talent, not vtterly co~demne my immaculate sinceritie, to your worthines.
Whose perpetuitie, togither with all your most happie desires, may the omnipotent powers of that almightie maiestie, whose breath commands both heauen, earth and seas, effectuate with eternall felicitie.
Euermore deuoted to your Worships seruice, L. A. TO THE COVRTEous Reader.
BY confessing my owne many faultes, iudge me (kind Gentlemen) worthy lesse blame.
But beleeue me, by reposing too much confidence on the Presse, hath not only aggrauated, but most grosely added to my errors, making mee hault downe right before your presence, like an abortiue childe, thrust into the world before his time.
VVhere you dislike, vtterly dispise not, but thinke would bee what am not, and so for your sakes, wishe were twentie times farre better.
Neuerthelesse, let not my offences staine the deserued praises which the sweete Poeticall inuentions of a speciall, and my most deare friende, hath intermixt with my rude prose, doth merite.
For his sake my hopes are the stronger, which intreate your gentle censures on my intent, amending, where there is no cause of commending, so
shall still remaine debtor for your courtesies, vntill with larger satisfaction, may in part manifest my due thankfulnesse.
L. A. THE THIRD BOOKE OF THE THIRD PART OF THE Myrror of Knighthood: Conteining the high and mighty deeds of the sonnes and Nephews of the Emperor Trebatio, with the valiant acts of other Princes and Knights.
Togither with the excellent deeds of warlike Ladies, with the end and dissolution of the three most famous Inchauntments of Lyriana, Roselia of Rome, and the Celebrated bewteous Linda, Brydes, Princesse of the Scythians.
I. Who Brauorant was, and why he left the Serpentarian Isle, to passe into Grecia.
WHen the dreadfull report of cruell Armes and Warre (mentioned in the third Booke of the first part of this Historie) was noysed through all the Pagan Nations, assembling, and in one vniting their seuerall puissant Hostes, vnder the conduct and commaund of Alicandro, mightie Emperour of ye Sythians, marching vnder his Ensignes against the Grecians, with intent of mortall reuenge, vtterly to subuert that Monarchy, leuelling Constantinople the seate of their Empyre with the earth, with perpetuall desolation.
this Scythian Monarche, one that for strength, valour and high déeds, held ouer all Pagan Knights and mightie Gyants, chiefe soueraigntie, in all military actions, as being of the fearcest, sole supreme Lord, called the Gran Bradamante Campeon: who procuring to eternize the memory of his linage, desired to haue a sonne so absolute in all accomplishments, that ioyfully he might passe this life, with assurance that none but he should imperate all those Orient Isles, in whose Conquest he had shead so much humane blood.
To effect which desire, he begot the most mightie Bramarant, of himselfe the onely homecide: as Lirgandeo in the first Booke of the second part hath recorded.
With like intent as the Father, departed the sonne, for ere hee left his Countrey, hée procured it, being in loue with a Gyantesse, whose fame for valour, did penetrate the vaultie skies.
With this went hée wondrous gladly to spill so much Grecian blood, where both Father and Sonne founde theyr Sepulchres in the Gréeke fields.
Now then dooth Galtener record, that composed these two Parts, howe the Gyantesse conceiued by the Famous Bramarante, and at the expiration of her time of trauell, was deliuered of a childe, for strengthe moste admirable, if not vnmatchable expectation.
For nourishing and bringing him vp as the proud father was, not with humane milke, but of Ounces, Tygers, and Lyonesses, whereof that Island yéeldes infinite.
At twelue yeares of age, he was as bigge and greate as any Knight of highest stature.
No wilde beaste coulde outrunne him, howe swifte soeuer hée were: For so admirable was the lightnesse of the sturdie youth, that hée would ouertake them in their course, and with his hands disioynt them, péece by péece, on whose fleshe hée fedde.
Being of fouretéene yeares, hée caused an Armour to bee made of scales of Fish, bredde in the Arthlanticke Sea, whose strength equalled the finest Diamonde: they were somewhat darke of colour, but hée garnisht them with Pearles and other riche stones, so excellently, that they séemed naturally to haue growne there.
He was not of bodie disproportioned as other Gyants, but composed of such orderly well knit members, that onely in strength he was accounted Gyantiue.
The newes of his father and Grandsires death, he receiued ere he receiued the order of knighthood, which hee himselfe of himselfe did take, saying: None merited the honour to giue him that dignitie, and so became both agent and patient to aduance his pride vnto the end of his desire, which was so great, that it amazed the world, hauing farre greater forces then his father Bramarante.
So when hee sawe himselfe with armes, and knewe the Greekes had slaine his Grandfather, hee solemnely protested on the hilts of his sword, to holde perpetuall enmitie with them.
Although presently arriued other sorrowfull newes of his fathers death, and how the Gréeke Princes with their owne hands intombde him, vowing to defend his armour against any that would presume to take them.
This somewhat pacified his rage, yet not to estéeme them his friends.
It gréeued his verie soule to heare that the king of Mauritania had dared to take away the armour of his deare father: that hee would stay no longer, thinking hee wronged his honour in the deferring of his iust reuenge.
This (aboue all the valiantest) hee had, that hee was courteous and gentle, and without sufficient cause would neuer vndertake, nor of any euer demaunde the combatte.
Arriuing in Grecia hee became more milder, not by méeting any that ouermatcht or equalled him in fight, but with the sole sight of the Gréekish Ladies gallantnesse.
Hée was prone to loue, and in pursuite thereof performed no mean aduentures.
Finally betwéene him and the furious Bembo, was all the strength of Paganisme diuided.
Hee tooke his leaue of his subiects, (for then he, none was euermore beloued of any) with whom hee left commaundement, that straight vpon report of warre against Greece, they should with the greatest power they could assemble, séeke him there, who onely with the son of the Gouernour of his kingdome, called Artanio, left the confines of Scythia, where he raigned, purposing to imploy himselfe in nothing till he met the Mauritanian Brufaldoro, and to take from him the armes of his so deare and valiant father, calling himselfe vnfortunafe, in that he had not known him.
His ship being rigged, and of all munition and tackling well prouided, within one moneth hee entred the vaste Greeke Ocean, which not a little gladded him to be in his enemies countrie.
On the fourth day of his Nauigation (hauing thitherto met with no aduenture woorthie a Historie) he descried making towards him a shippe, whereat he reioyced excéedingly, hoping to knowe newes of his demaund.
The shippes in their méeting came so neare, that Brauorant might well discerne vpon the hatches of this strangers shippe, two knights of gallant disposition, clad in rich and strong Armor, with whose sight he rested highly contented, for in all his life he had not séene better accomplisht Gentlemen.
They wore their Helmets off to take the freshnesse of the aire, and séeing he ioyned his to their shippe, they put them on.
Sir Knights, shalbe highly fauoured to know neare what land we are, and how farre we be from the nighest? Eleuated in contemplation were the two, séeing so stout a youth, for hauing his vyzor raised, they sawe his beard did not as then spring foorth.
The one replied, you now do nauigate sir knight in the Gréekish sea, and are not aboue thrée daies sailing from Constantinople, for so many is it since we thence departed.
In curtesie then tell me (required the sturdie youth) whether he that slew the Gran Campeon Bradaman, be now in that Citie, for it greatly concernes me to méete with him? And cannot beléeue, nor is it possible, that onely one to one he should ouercome him, whom all the Orientall Regions feared.
The other answered, That Prince is in Greece (Knight) and if you proue your selfe with him, you shall finde that was nothing he then did, so great is his valiantnesse and vnmatched strength, whereto the heauens ioyned all their influences to make it incomparable.
To heare the Gréeke so praised, did excéedingly vexe the youth.
Surely if all in Greece be as valiant in fight, as they are singular in their Princes praises, they cannot be lesse estéemed then for the wonders of Chiualry, and in the world soly excellent for déeds in armes.
So are they indéed (replied the knight) and he that dares gaine say it, here defie him to mortall battell.
Defie me (answered he) Oh heauens! is this tollerable heare? that before sée the countrie of my enemies, there should bee any to dare me and challenge me? therefore no longer would the inraged Pagan stay, but commaunding his barke to be grappled close with his aduersaries, hee drewe foorth his furious blade.
Against Mars would not the other refuse the combat, but in this gets he little: for being with triall assured of the Pagans strength, hée straight imagined what small honour hee should get in that attempt.
For the raging Scythian raising his Merculean arme, as that was the first blowe, so would he make it notable, which indéed was such a one, that lighting on the top of his helme, hee slised away the one half, with part of the and descended on his shoulder with such waight, that he thought a Tower had fallen thereon: which made him fall vnto the ground vpon his handes, loosing a péece of his vanbrace.
Another seconded the new Mars, lessening the former with the furie of the latter, lighting on him as he rose in the middle of his stro~g shield, which as if it had béene made of a thin plate, was cleane cut from the one to the other end, and the blowe fearcely falling on his sight, astonished, felled him al along vpon the barke, voyding much blood throgh his nose and mouth.
An Eagle in lightnesse was the Pagan, so would he follow leaping after him: but the supreme guider of the Orbes did otherwise appoint it, moouing his companion to succour him with incredible seleritie, making the Scythians of none effect, by giuing him a venturous thrust on the sturdie breast, making him recoyle backewards: for had he lept into their shippe, both had left their liues in the handes of the angrie Pagan, who like a furious Basseliske offered againe the daungerous leape, but to prohibit him, stood the amorous Florisarte, for it was he and his father, with the disguised Princesses that were there, who departing from Greece, were brought to that passe, that they accounted themselues surely vanquished, so fierce séemed the Scythian.
By this was the father risen, reioycing at the good ayde his sonne had giuen him.
Againe reioyned the two barkes, and their beeing both togither, increased their hopes of victorie.
The haughtie youth refused them not, but rather ioyed thereat, iudging them Knights of estimation, and since so valiant tokens they shewed thereof, he thought that vanquishing them, some honour he might atchieue by the conquest.
He was inraged against the some for disturbing him from winning the enterance of their ship: and so suffering a mightie blow, that had he not bene Brauorant that receiued it, no other could haue the heart to endure the second.
At his pleasure did he reache the beloued Florisarte on the one
Farre did not the sword enter, for the Scythian staied his arm, but all that it reached, which was the shield it snatcht fro~ his hands, making him turne twice or thrice about, like with staggering to fall: he stept nigher to the edge, to discharge another, which happened as he would: for taking him about the shoulders, the blade bounded vpwards, else it had strooke away his head: but so puissant was the furious stroake, that it disarmed all that side, and fell with such huge heauie strength, that it strooke him downe in the middle of the barke.
Like a swelling serpent became the father, séeing his sonne so handled, that with the vtmost of his strength he discharged his rage vppon the Gygantine youth, who not respecting it, would not ward it (but to bée giuen by the hands of the valiant Tharcian) it was too much proude confidence to respect it: which made him sée more starres then the loftie Firmament contained.
He staggered too vnséemely steppes backwards, almost falling, but recouering himselfe, he fomed through the Vyzor like a hunted Boore: blaspheming irreligiously against his goddesse.
By this time came the sonne, and knowing that one onely knight handled them in that manner, with both his hands hee laid vpon his Helme, which sounded like a bell.
In all his life he had not receiued the like: for it made him bend his head with no litle paine: and with more spéed then he would, euen to his brest.
Scarcely had the sonne executed his, when the father discharged an other in the same place.
They forced him to set his hands on the ground: It was to their will, for returning more furious then a hunted Lyon in his greatest rage, as he rose, with a counterbuffe he tumbled the father on the middest of his backe, so sore brused with the blowe, that almost hee could not after stand on his féete.
The sonne maintained the fight, procuring rather to defend himselfe from the Pagans fierce blowes, then to offend.
But what auaileth it? for the father being arriued in his helpe, their aduersary neuer fully reached them any blowe, but he lanched forth their blood, wherwith they both were withal couered, and althogh they had somewat wearied and more inraged him, yet was his Armor neither cut nor rased, and had the battle béene made on land, it had
ere this bene ended, either with death or vanquishment of both.
For the haughtie youth was borne to fight, finding ease therein: and so had he in the ende of thrée houre, so tyred and wounded them, that longer they could scarce holde out: Yet for all this, did not the Knights loose any part of their courage, which was such, that they forced the son of Bramarant to increase in forces, bellowing like a bayted Bull: and yet highly estéeming them, in respect of their shewen valour.
Long hadde hee desired to winne their shippe, and so now to acccomplish the same: with a thrust, hee draue the Argentarian Prince to the farthest side of it, and after him woulde hee haue leapt, if that a suddaine that happened, hadde not parted farre asunder both shippes, following after it, so great a misty thicke fogge, with so much thundring and lightning, that the prowdest heart was daunted with feare.
Which beeing past, they sawe themselues so sundred, that straight eyther lost the sight of the other, and in the Princes Shippe, immeasurable was their griefe for the two Pages losse, that in that tempest were conueyed away: insomuch, that the amorous Florisart was like to runne madde with sorrowe: and it was not much, for none (liuing) was euer better entertained.
Heere their friende Nabato would not leaue them with such paine, so hee appeared to them in theyr Barke, saying.
Valiant Princes, there is no cause why you shuld gréeue at the heauens decrée, and what is directed according to their will: and thinke it not little that you haue sustained your selues so long against that Pagan: for there be fewe on the earth so valiant as he: and let this be no strangenesse to aggrauate your mindes, for it will alwaies redound to to the honor of Greece.
Touching the Pages, it was time they should returne to whom sent them: and therefore sorrow not, for they are in place where they shall bee entreated as their persons do deserue.
And you gallant Florisart, that haue most reason of gréef, take courage: for only it must most aduance your immortall honor.
least you thinke of your glory, you shall be challenged to obserue and performe your promise giuen to Artimio, accounting (through the great content you then shall receiue) all the troubles and tormenting passions you shall henceforth thitherto endure (which will not be few) to be but the passage of so many pleasures: but against many others that may befall you, your valour and fortitude is very sufficient.
So soone as you bee arriued at Argentaria (for so it behooueth the ease and quietnesse of Rosabell with the greatest Fléete of ships and gallyes (detracting no time) that you may make ready, take your course towards the Chappell of Saint George.
For in despite of our mortall and great enemie Lupercio, Ile place a signall on Lyrianas inchauntment, that thereby you may repaire thither, séeing it a very far off: and let there be no negligent forgetfulnesse herein, for it toucheth no lesse then the Ladies libertie, to be done by Gréekes and their friends, by the happie comming of the vnknowne Lyon.
And hereupon he tooke his leaue, ending his spéech, and departed from them.
Who no sooner landed in their dominions, and being receiued with the loue that Flora did beare them, they gaue order for all what the wiseman had told them, gathering togither of both kingdoms thrée hundred royall gallies, well prouided with most warlike men, and all manner of other necessarie munition.
For thrée miles from Rome appeared a most strange inchauntment, making at the fixing so mightie a noise, that all the Vallies thereabout did resound, and that famous Citie trembled with the sound.
The Emperor was amazed, not knowing the cause of that sudden But after a while there came a Knight that told him, how in the Forrest there was to bee séene a great and woondrous Castle of maruellous and seldome séene worke: and that hauing read certain letters written on a Pillar, he perceiued it to be the inchauntme~t of the Princesse Roselia.
Great contentment receiued her father and mother, to know newes of their deare daughter, hauing thitherto supposed her dead: hoping now assuredly to sée her, since she was brought to such a place.
Nabato did comfort them, saying: The time would come, they should sée her, receiuing more ioy then at that instant they had.
So he departed from them, procuring the disinchaunting of Lyriana, (and sée if thereby the great warres might be appeased, which he imagined would about her happen) to espouse her to Rosabel, and as he thought, he presently put it in execution, setting in despight of Lupercio, (hauing greater skil then he) on the top of the maruellous Tower, a burning Cloud, flaming so mightily, that it séemed continually to cast vpwards flames of inextinguable fire.
It was séene farre off, and therefore there were fewe vppon the seas but repaired thither, although without it, there had not failed to come the famous Bembo, with the Souldan of Egypt, which was a brother to him slaine, yet farre more stronger.
Neither at his due time wanted the great Lord of Nyquea himselfe, with a mightie Fléete.
For Lupercio found that Gréeke Prince should end the aduenture, and maugre all the world, beare away Lyriana: and to forbid that no other Knight might approach to proue the aduenture, he stirred vp and mooued the valiantest Knights in the whole vniuerse against the Gréekes, as hereafter shall at large be exprest.
And yet by the signe, the great Magician Nabato set, all the flower of Grecia vnited, was there assembled.
The mightie Brauorant could not but sée it, for parting from the two famous Princes, his Galley so nauigated the Mediterranean Ocean, that he sawe the fearefull flames that issued from the Sea.
Desirous to sée such straunge aduentures, was the stout and fierce Pagan, and to proue himselfe therein, ioying to haue left his Countrey, to participate of his begunne sights, imagining that his strong and valiant arme was sufficient to terminate such a déede, he commaunded thither to be directed, where quickly he arriued, amazed to sée the Tower and the maruellous workemanship thereof, vnable to conceiue who could frame so admirable a thing.
He read ye superscriptions, not regarding what Armes were required for that attempt, he flung (as Bembo had done) at one of the Pillers whereon the Tower was built: but at that instant, there arose so much fire, that all his fury strength nothing auailing him, with want inough thereof he gaue ouer, where his Armour stood him in no small stéed, for being made of those bones that are most colde, they were able to defend some part of the heate of that fire, and blaspheming on his Goddes, he stood looking if he could finde any other entrance: and séeing none, he thought it best to depart, vowing to returne thither, and defend that none other should trie it,
since he had not ended it, it cost many liues: and to performe it, he commaunded his Pylot to make towardes Mauritania, for he desired to be there, to demaund his fathers Armes of Brufaldoro, or loose his life in their pursuite.
The weather was faire, calme, and prosperous, fauouring his voyage, for in eight daies he landed there: he was glad thereof, and so tooke foorth a mightie roane Courser, the best that all his Countrey did affoord, of such force, as it easily might beare the sturdie youth.
On another mounted his Squier Artanio, and taking the largest path, he beganne to pace foorth in haste, to learne of some one, if the king of that lande were there to séeke him.
Straight was he assured ther of, reioycing greatly thereat, being perswaded none could disturbe him from winning the Armour that once belonged to his deare father.
But to rest himselfe, he entered through a faire Forrest, passing that day there, til it was time to sléepe, which was but little, by reason of that which befell him.
What hapned vnto the mightie Brauorant, with a strange knight, and who he was.
SCarce was the middle houre of that same season past, when rest in silent quietnesse surpriseth the waking eyes of euery one, to make them cease their laborious daily toyle, suffering the wandering passengers of gloomy darkenesse, with night tripping Fairies to progresse throgh those walks, that the absence of their exilde light doeth limit them, in blacke obscuritie: when a suddain new alteration inforced the haughtie Pagan from his accustomed vncontrowled sléepe.
For the heard not far from him, the complaints of some one, whose necessitie vrged him to lament.
He was as is said, in nature contrary to all others of his kind, and like his Father onely in strength.
For he pittied those distressed, offering his person in theyr required aide: hee rose, and closing his Beauer, went to the place
from whence he heard the plaintes, and by the pale shine of Cynthias watery beames, he sawe sitting at the foote of a knottie Oake, a well proportioned knight, apparrelled in most rich Armour, complaining of loue.
The Pagan knew not what it ment, and therefore to sée his effects, he got behinde another Trée verie neare vnto the knight: who had not all that night slept, bewayling his chaunce, neyther would he do it, but to participate his griefe to those that felt it not.
So not regarding, because not séeing the Pagan, he beganne with a thousand sighes, witnesses of his soules sorrow, to vtter the gréeued burthen it sustained: and with such grace, that Brauorant rested amazed, iuding him some celestiall creature, respecting the swéete harmony of his voyces, he did with all attention listen, and ouerheard the Louer in this maner sing against Fortune, these verses following.
FOrtune is blinde, she lookes on no mans need, And deafe, she hearkens vnto no mans call: And cruell, she respects not who doth bleed, And enuious, she reioyceth at ones fall.
No Bewtie can vnmaske her eies, No Force can driue attention to her eares: No Griefe make her pittie rise, Nor is her Enuie thaw'd with Vertues teares.
She at aduentures lets her Fauours flie, Without proportion, without due regards: The base vnworthy, now she mounts on hie, And fatteth dunghils with her best rewards.
Anon they tumble to their first estate, And other on the tottering wheele are set: Who neuer finde repentance, till too late, And then they finde it in sad sorrowes net.
Such fortune is, and oh what hap haue To serue a Goddesse lighter then the winde: Constant in nothing, but inconstancy, As also enuious, cruel, deafe and blinde.
Fortune is blind, Oh what can me betide? But blind mishap, that serue so blind a guide.
With a breathlesse heart breaking (hay me) ended the Louer, principiating her oppressed soules discharge thus.
What auailed it, Oh what auailed it me (heroycke warrior) so to my honors cost, reputations wrack, to reueale vnto thée the tenure of my Loues secrets, whose tribute is only due to thy incomparable merits? It was more then became me, violating those immaculate rytes of ours, which are first to be intreated, and then vpon sufficient proofe, to like.
knowe not on whom to complaine? not of my selfe, for neuer was any better imployed, nor yet their thoughts higher sublimated? No, complaine of my hard fortune, for that the sacrifice of my will offered in his hands, could be no meanes to confirme in part, the hope he gaue me on the sandes of the Gréeke sea coast, to be soly mine.
For if so now vnderstood it, who would be so weake, and so mistrustfull a Louer, as with so many sorrowes to séeke the thing loued, and with a number of infinit sighes, that vnsought for, would méete me, since would not refuse what he admitted, nor could my Loue fancie but what he desired, louing? But griefe, cannot beléeue, but that misfortune and my selfe, were both borne Twinnes at one selfe same birth.
haughtie Tynacrian, thinke not but it is a blot to thy immortall fame, to shewe thy selfe cruel vnkind, gainst him whom hath yéelded soule thoughts to thée.
It is a tyrannie altogither vnbeséeming whom thou art, and what thou diddest protest at our departure.
The sterne fierce Pagan would not interrupt him, but astonied to heare what he said, hearkened, vnable to resolue whether man or woman he was.
All the night past they away, one in his laments, and the other in his newe doubts, vntil the appearing of Auroras shine began to giue warning of the morning Sunnes vprise.
And then leauing his stand, went towards the Knight, that séeing it was day, had laced on his helme, fearing to be knowne.
The knightly Gyant séeing him, with excéeding courtesie, that most adorned him, he beganne to speake.
You haue inforced me (sir Knight) to passe this night so disquietted, by hearing you publish your griefe, that in recompence thereof, intreate you may knowe the cause, and if the hazarding of my person to woorke your content, may bee a seruice accepted, shall rest happie to bee so imployed.
The Ladie well noted him, thinking she had neuer séene a brauer nor better armed knight, and his ciuill demenour, bound her to a milde answere, but she was in such an amorous rage, that not considering the end, replied.
Why then, woorse will the day be to me, then was the night to you, knowing that you haue heard what the verie soule dares not trust it selfe withall, and know not what lawe of armes admits it.
Your fauour refuse, for hauing committed such an offence, as to require the knowledge of a strangers deare hearts secret, against his will that loues, which if declare, how should thinke it could be conceald by you? So may you returne, for the gréefe that mée torments, is pleasant onely in concealement.
had not thought (replied the Pagan) that through intreating thée, with what amongst good knights is vsed, should haue put thée in that arrogant confidence, as to néede none others ayde, beeing a thing so contrarie to reason.
If thou knewest the lawe of Loue (replied the Knight) thou should knowe there is no happinesse therein, but to loue with secrecie, for that is it that assureth any doubtfull hope.
But to recount my cares to one that ca~not redresse them, with more then a dolefull (I am sorrie) we sigh more in hauing a straungers companie, then for discret circumspectnesse.
It cannot be exprest what rage the Pagan conceiued, for being insolently bolde, he was onely noted of immoderate rashnesse, and so answered.
Then, that thou mayest know that to haue told it me was thy aduantage, ingage thée to the battell, that by taking away thy puling life, the paines whereof thou doest complaine, may also end.
Mars was not more fierce then the Louer, beeing angered, and so without longer stay, drew foorth one of the worlds best blades.
Mightie hee was: but hee met with that strength whereto Mylos forces neuer reacht, through conceiued rage he was quicker in executing his blow, discharging it on the shield, of which to the ground hee threwe a péece, beating the rest so heauily on his heade, that it almost astonished him.
He stept in with his right foote, and with a steddie strong thrust he forst him with staggering paces backwards: he wold not yet leaue the chase for turning his sword vnderhand, let it flie at his right thigh, making his aduersaries flesh féele the cutting of his sharpe blade.
Neuer was Serpent in the desert Libia more rigorous then the Pagan now did returne vpon the knight, and where he thought his blow
would be of more effect, thither hee strucke: the other raised his shield, but it was of no defence, for although hee did not cut it, through the finesse of the temper, yet it so charged him, that hee set his hands on the ground, and ere hee rose, hee felt another, which made him thinke hee sawe the starrie firmament.
The blood congealed in his mouth, and fréezed in his bodie, séeing the fiercenesse of the Pagan, which hee thought farre to excéede the Gréeke Princes.
He rose vp, for hee was couragious, minding to vse his nimblenesse, but as therein the Scythian excéeded the swiftnesse of any Hart, it auaild him not from receiuing most cruell blowes, kissing the earth sometimes with his knées, and sometimes with his handes.
Neuer felt he himselfe so persecuted, nor at the poynt to loose the fame he had obtained for valour, and therefore did hee redouble his blowes so strong and thicke, that the Pagan was forced to deuise newe defensiue wards.
Excéedingly he reioyced to sée what braue knights he met in his iourney towards the parts of Grecia, déeming him of that countrie, where the Authors of his life were intombde.
This remembrance so vext him, that hee supposed it cowardise to continue in single combat so long: so letting a blowe flie aloft, hee discharged the seconde with such mightie strength on his aduersaries helme, that it rezounded like a bell: and not able to penetrate it, so heauily it waighed on one side, that breaking all the laces, buckles, and riuets, it strucke it from his head, making the knight vpholde himselfe with his handes: but at his rising Apollos beautie séemed not so faire that day, as Floralizas great Alicandros Néece, that wandring throgh straunge lands in search of her Poliphebo, had arriued there.
In all his life did not the Pagan receiue such a blowe (as with her sight) for in all the same, he forgot not the memorie of that day: hee stayed his sword, and stepping foorth, vnlaced his helme, setting to view his sturdie visage, more faire then swartie, yet with many wrinkled checkes, and one great mole on his front, approoued tokens of his excessiue strength, his shield he cast away, and taking his sword by the poynt, (through the newe tuch of loue) hee spake with more ciuilitie then the most amorous.
Admired Goddesse, beséech you pardon my mad presumption, although féele alreadie the punishment thereof, for the not knowing
you, forced me to it, yet repute it well, if it redownde not to your farther displeasure, which will be to me a more vnhappier death, in that haue séene the excellencie of beautie and valour: and so intreate you, as deseruer of farre more honour, you will accept my sword in signe of victorie, and Ile defend that all the world doth owe it you.
It greatly delighted the Ladie to sée the knights courtesie, and imagining he was of estéeme, replied.
will not (sir knight) haue you in all things take the better of the fight, for the victorie is yours, leauing not thereby indebted to your content.
Her handes to kisse then required the newe Mars, thinking no greater good might bee expected then the present.
Shée drew them from him, demanding who he was? So yoaked was the Pagan, that he could not denie it, nor through contemplation say any thing, yet thus he spake.
There was no reason (diuine Goddesse) to intreate, what by commaunding makes me happie in obedience.
am called Brauorant, sonne to that famous Bramarant, which in Greece was deathes man to himselfe, and Nephewe to that Campeon, which lost his life by the hands of a Gréeke Prince (although cannot beléeue it) and therefore haue left my countrie, of purpose to be reuenged on the Gréeks and the Mauritanian king, whose land we now tread, because hee tooke away my fathers armour: and also come to know the Prince Meridian, whose vassaile am, and greatest friend in respect of the loue that he and the mightie Midinaro his Grandfather did beare vnto my kindred.
And this is all can say, praying the like, not in regard of my relation, but that may know my Soueraigne.
greatly desire to knowe my stocke, and whom am, that might therein satisfie your content (braue Brauorant: and assure you, that the most knowe, is, that knowe not whom am, more then that a brother of mine and my selfe, were brought vppe togither in a wood, without other conuersation then of a wise man, that did instruct vs in all vertues, whom wee reputed our father, till hee assured vs the contrarie, and through the accidents befallen, some haue tolde vs wee are the children of that so loued Prince Meridian.
beléeue no lesse, but that those which are the earths chief lights (aunswered the amorous Scythian deriue their diuine discent from the heauens, whence your sacred Grandfather procéeds.
As they were in this conuersation, they sawe him comming whom they soght, mounted on a mightie Courser, he wore not then the armour of that Mars and mightie Bramarant, kéeping them onely to weare in Grecia, the more to despight her Princes.
The Ladie knewe him, and tolde it the fierce Pagan, that cried out for ioy, saying.
This aduenture (excellent Ladie) admits comparison solely with that of your knowledge.
Now am certaine of all good fortune, since the heauens haue set before mine eyes with so smal toyle the thing most desired.
He arose with angrie paces, and called for his fierce horse.
The like did the Ladie, lightly vawting into the saddle.
The Scythian was nothing enuious thereat, for in lightnesse the Orientall nations affoorded not his péere, and brandishing his lance, made against the Mauritanian: but what happeneth describeth the next Chapter.
What befell vnto the mightie Bramorant, with the warrelike Brufaldoro, the most cruell battell betweene them, and how they were parted by Floraliza.
SOme content may the angrie aspect of the two warrtours mooue, that representing Mars, either to the other approached.
What vnexpected motion of suddaine alteration (knights) hath my comming sturde in yée? If you stand in any néede speake, for in the vttering consists the remiede.
Of nothing haue we néede (replied Campeons fierce Nephew, for if any had wrongd vs, we haue hands not to remit our remedie to others.
That which hath mooued this knight and my selfe with hastie paces to méete you, is onely to know what cause the Mauritanian king had, to take away the armes of that glorious Bramarant, knowing
how thereby he angred the Gréeke Princes, yet no matter for this (I séeke not their contents) but thou shouldst imagine, that a senne, of his liuing, greater was the wrong to take them, since they were his right, guiding thy selfe thereto more by insolencie, then the dutie of a knight.
Neuer did the barbarous Sarazin nation know a more prouder Pagan then the king of Mauritania, and supposing him like to others he had tried, with a fearefull voyce hee replied.
What, cowarde knight, thinkest thou that méeting with those armes, would through feare leaue them, although did incense the heauens, and anger euery one the earth contained? Oh, wish had them here to weare them in triumph of my valours victorie, making the powers of heauen knowe to thy cost, no terrene merits better deserues to weare them then Brufaldoro.
Milde in the beginning was the Scythian, but being mooued to rage, no Basseliske is like to him, so roring like a bull, and turning his horse, casting his eyes vp to the skie, said.
Is it possible that liuing sole sonne to Bramarant should suffer this? and that any other but he should threaten me, permitting, sithens thou haste his armour, and detaines them, not to procure them, or loose my life in the enterprise? So great was their rage, that the one could neither prosecute his spéech, nor the other make reply, leauing to their handes what their tongues could not vtter.
Now would here (but know not how may) againe implore your sacred helps (admired Ladies of vnspotted purities) but ye importunate to~gue euermore tuned with this one vocal note, dasht my thoghts in their expected hopes.
dare, oh dare not presume, least should waken your slumbering displeasures, (they are woorse then then thousand deaths) to pray the comfort of a smile, the soules nourishment and hearts incourager, to tread the difficultie of Dedalus inextricable laborinth, or as Hercules to vndergo so many labors.
But being repulst in selfe conceit, shall flie to those chaste diuine Nimphs of that euerflowing fountaine of tongue inspiring musicke, that some one (not busied in the laies of loue) would inchaunt my rusticke penne with a delicious method, according to the two mightie warriours deserts?
They did refuse my plaints, referring my Orizons to your desiding doom, submitting their wils to your greater co~manding powers, whose
With trembling feare doo once againe awaite your censures: Oh, in regard of their immaculate triple trinitie graunt it, be it but vnder the couert of a fained smile: whose obtained imagination swifter then the winde, brought the sterne combattants to incounter with more noyse, then Vulcans thunderboltes do rent the clowdie ayre amidst their furious passage, or fiercer then the tempesteous waues raised by the vnbridled rage of a whirlewinde, beate on the flintie rockes: yet was it nothing in respect of the horrour that these two rare in armes committed with their launces.
Of knottie Oake were they, but arriuing at the brest, brake as they were of weake cane or small reedes: either past by the other without motion, although the Moore at his turning about, throgh the astonishment of the shocke lost his right stirrope.
Aloft with their swords raised togither, they discharged them on their helms with more force, then doth a waterie current descending from a stéepie hill breake through a riuers locke.
Venturous was the Mauritanians blowe, for it lighted on the toppe of his plumed crest, striking away all the stéeled circuite, with part of the maled gorget, on his shoulder praide the furious sword, falling so heauily, that he bowed belowe his horse necke.
On the shield did the fierce youth strike the Mauritanian, it is no defence against the rigorous arme, for the halfe it tooke away, making him shake like an Aspen leafe.
They were both most skilfull, so turned they to second others, and the Affricanian let flie a poynt, which the youth surely felt, who reacht him ere he could fetch home his arme, with a crosse counterbuffe on the side of his helme, that all that part he left disarmed, ouerturning him more then hee willingly would on his left stirrope: it was no occasion to be lost, so assalting with his sword inwards before he could ward it, did giue another no lesse dangerous on his sight, so mightie, that the blood gusht from his nose.
Neuer was troden Serpent more rigorous then now the Affrican returned, that seeing himselfe so handled, crushing one tooth with another, with his blade mounted on high, executed on his helme such a blowe, that it almost strooke him sencelesse.
Hee well perceiued his alteration, so tooke he the aduantage entring with a cruell thrust, had not his armes béene as they were, there had the battell ended: but they were so strong, that the sword could not enter them, so sliding thence,
it lighted twixt the buckles of his brest, cutting down his strong male, and he was happie to shrinke his bodie to himselfe, else hee had béene mortally wounded.
He past his carrier so swiftly, that the Scythian could not strike him when he wold.
With such nimblenes returned the haughtie Affrican, that his courage amazed the inuincible youth.
But now was hee at the vtmost of his rage, and willing to make it known, casting his shield at his backe, let driue at him a most mightie blowe.
Ward it with his sword and the remnant of his shielde would the Affrican: it was of no defence, for from one to the other end it was clean diuided in two, and méeting with his sword, both made so cruell a stroke on his helme, that though it contained two fingers in thicknesse, he gaue him a perilous wound on his left side.
The Mauritanian would not deserre his payment, for closing his sword firmly, and séeing him without shield, discharged the puissance of his armes on his sure helme, it was it saued his life, and his head from cleauing: neuerthelesse it was so heauie, that it strooke him along vpon his coursers backe, redoubling another vppon his broad breast, that it almost stopt the passage of his breath.
Admirable was the sight of the more then cruell fight: for Apollo hauing made his course vnto the middest of the vaultie heauens, there stayed to gaze vpon their warre, glad to sée the warriours, that without signe of aduantage, had foure houres maintained their fierce combat.
Yet something better sped the Scythian, by reason of his inpenitrable armes that kept his bodie from cutting.
Which was not so with the Mauritanian, for in some places was he sore hurt, but yet was no cause to make him shewe any faintnesse, it rather increased his courage to sée his blood inamell the earth.
Amazed stood the gallant Ladie to viewe the Pagans battel, iudging the worlds whole strength was twixt these two reparted.
Greatly she desired to giue order in parting them, imagining yt with the death of any Greece, she lost one of the valiantest and greatest enemies she had.
This toucht her verie soule: yet would she not séeme to disgrace the mightie Brauorant: so shee againe regazed on the fight, thinking in the end he would get the better, seeming most Maister thereof.
He gaue the other a blowe ere she could terminate her presumption, vppon his helme, that in a trance hee strooke him on his horse crupper.
while was he carried so about the field, yet not so long, that he might second another ere hee recouered himselfe.
Who like a Hercanian Tiger, with his sword twixt both handes, executed his rage vpon his shield: so mightily did it ioyne with his head, that it astonisht him, and with another almost ouerthrewe him.
The raging mountain Lyonesse wanting her whelps, is like a milde lambe, compared with the puissant matchlesse Scythian, that renouncing his Gods with execrable blasphemies, spurd against the Moore, and so eager was he in his carrier, that he closed so neare hee could not execute his blowe, more then cast his armes about him with such power, that he snatcht him from his saddle, whose waight forest him to leaue his stirropes leape after him, falling both on the hard ground, with more strength they imbraced then doth the tender Iuie incompasse about the sturdie Oake.
good while tumbled they vp and downe the earth, till séeing neither could so vanquish his aduersarie, at once they parted, repairing to their weapons, whose sight once more might satisfie any minde of the like desire: for if the Mauritanian be nimble, the Scythian is a Roe in swiftnesse.
Here might Mars himselfe learne as in a schoole, and with militarie principles gorge his sight.
For being a foote on ground, it was admirable, to note the dexteritie wherewith they assaulted, and skilful manner of retires.
Thrée houres of the afternoone were past, and they without feare of any losse, redoubled their blowes as in the beginning.
More vsed to armes was the Moore: but the youth was borne with his stéeled coate, finding ease amiddest the greatest warre: so beganne hee to vaunt of his aduantage to the Mauritanians coste, that beeing wounded, beganne to faint, yet not so plainly, but would diuers times put his battell in hazard.
By this would Tytans shining beames obscure his splendor, drenching it in the Spanish Ocean, when the Ladie apparantly sawe the aduantage on Brauorants partie, and iudged him sufficiently honored therewith, leapt from her horse, and stepping betwéene them, said.
Apart, apart, braue warriours, for it is no reason about a trifle of so small importance, you should make the world Orphant of your persons.
Captiuated was the Pagan in the giues of his Ladies gallantnesse, that he replied thus.
Heroicke Knight, though in some respect be herein wronged, wil not worke your discontent, and do leaue the battle in this estate.
take vpon me valiant knight (said he) the wrong offered you (if it be any to leaue the fight) and doubt not but this knight wil take it well to cease it at this time.
Well perceiued the Mauritanian he might be fully perswaded now to haue the worst, so he answered, he was content, and they should not want another time to ende it.
Thankfull vnto him for it was Floraliza, and offering him her friendship, the Moore departed, bearing with him inough to talke off in his Citie, of the Scythians courage.
They sat them downe, and the youth tooke off his helme: the like did the Ladie, discoursing of Brufaldoros brauery.
This vertue among the rest, greatly adorned Brauorant, that he neuer tooke from any the merites that he thought him worthie of.
So was he first in giuing a beginning to Brufaldoros praises.
No better medicine could come to the lustie youth, then the sight of that humane Goddesse, whose bewtie had so inchaunted his sences, that he iudged her all diuine.
He was not constant, for seeing the Gréeke Ladies, he straight forgot Floraliza, only the supremacy of bewtie, making change in him.
Most part of the night past they with different thoughts: for the Pagan was soly ouerwhelmed in Contemplation of the Ladies graces, not daring to manifest his glorie, for yet he was not sufficiently toucht with loues fierie euil.
The Lady though she was glad to haue such company, were it but because he was an enemy to the Gréekes, answered with her toong what her heart felt not, which she had left in the possession of the Tynacrian, whose absence was able to distract her, thinking she should not sée him any more.
It is easie for the soule to beléeue the euil it is addicted too, for as it liues fearful and in doubt of the desired good, any contrary accident that happens, taketh firme possession of the Louer.
In this conuersation were the vncontrowled Brauorant and the Ladie, when they heard a great noyse like the fighting of many knights, they tooke their way towards it, neuer finding out where it was.
For the Magitian Lupercio, had deuised it to conduct the Pagan to the keeping of the maruellous Tower.
So lost he the Lady which so extreamly greeued him, that he had almost lost his wits: wandring thrée dayes vp and downe those woods calling for her, yet could heare no tydings,
till thinking she was shipt to sea, he with his Page Artanio did the like.
He arriued at the Tower, where he made his abode to the cost of many Fames, sending those that went with him in the shippe, to the land for his necessary prouision.
Where for this time we leaue him, till other occasion that wil minister matter inough of his valiantnesse, and the Lady in search of Polliphebo, returning to Esclauonia, for in so long delaie, we mightily haue wronged the Princesse Venus.
How the Prince Claridiano returned to prison, first discouering him selfe to Don Eleno, and what else happened.
FRom the famous Citie of Xantho, went the two warriours (most faire Ladies) either enuious of the other, to haue seene the haughtie Chiualries by their inuincible armes.
With ioy they met the Page and Dwarffe, that expected them in the Forrest, discoursing of the Fortitude wherewith they procéeded in the battle, leauing their names in Xantho, consecrated to eternitie.
Of great estéeme (said the Dwarffe) should those knightes prisoners be of, hauing obtained such defence.
Thou sayest well (answered the Gréeke) for in the end according to their necessitie, they were succoured with the valour of this knight, to whom the palme of the victorie is due.
wil not agrée thereto Syr knight (said ye Dacian ), since the experience you haue this day showne of your vnconquered arme, witnesseth against any that on my behalfe may be alleaged.
But leauing this (alreadie alighted from their horses) it will glad my very soule, to knowe who hath this day inacted so many wonders.
In comparison of yours (said the Gréeke) warlike Prince of Dacia, mine are of so small name, that they may boast of nothing more, then to be atchiued by the fauours of your presence, whose imaginatio~, and ye knowledge that Don Eleno of Dacia went in my defence, made me draw strength from my weaknes, to shewe, yt at least in something
should wrong the Darian Lord, not to tell him who hath this day receiued such happie ayde.
His vncle did straight knowe him, and with a ioyfull voyce embracing him, said.
Vntill the death shall complaine mee of this wrong (most excellent Prince of Greecia in so long delaying the content should receiue by knowing you.
For had been witting of such deare companie, had still conceiued more assurance of the victorie.
My selfe being armed with that assurance, Heroicke Prince (replied the Gréeke) made me reserue till now my discouerie, purposing still fro~ the beginning to do it til the battell ended, of whose good successe nothing doubted seeing you therein: and that you may bee assured by what meanes you haue bound me to your obseruance, know, that the combat was made for my libertie, being called in this countrie the Dpairing Knight, whose Princesse taking pittie of my wrong imprisonment, procured meanes to liberate me, and found one difficult ynough, which was, to let me out through her garden, and gaue mée this armour, that disguised, might for my selfe demaund the battell: and since it hath so happened to our content, let vs procure it for that Ladie, by againe presenting my selfe in her handes, your selfe beeing witnesse thereof, for in nothing wronging the beautious Rosamonde, little is aduentured therein.
It is iust (replied the Dacian braue Claridiano, that herein all our friends and kinsfolkes ayde vs: and let vs go, for whosoeuer stayes, any delay is hurtfull.
Let vs away (saide the Gréeke) for more then is done resteth to be executed, and in affairs wherein our hands must be inured.
For know, that this Ladie (one of the worlds beauties) is inamored of the suspitious knight, who is the Prince of Croatia, that is prisoner, whose amitie made me promise a thing inhumane, reason almost impossible, that maugre all the kingdome, would set her in his hands, but now sée fortune hath broght it to more facilitie, conducting you hither: and assure you, that his noblenesse and friendship deserueth any kindnesse: wherto the Dacian spake.
It is ynough to effect it (Heroicke Prince) if you haue promised it, for by loosing my life, do accomplish what am bound to.
With these animating reasons they arriued to the doore where the Ladie expected them, with so great feare seeing they staied so long, that she was a thousand times about to go away.
The two haughtie warriours alighted, and the Prince giuing his watchword, the ioyfull Lady opened the doore and said: promise you dispairing knight, you behaue your selfe so like an ill prisoner, that another time there wil be no license to walke foorth, hauing made this so long.
He replied, am so pleasant (excellent Princesse) with this imprisonme~t, that wold ere returned bring company with me, that the might participate of the ioy here enioyed.
greater offence then the committed, deserueth pardon with so good excuse.
Conditionally (answered she) that know who he is, for séeing with what courage he helped the Greeke Prince, makes me suspect he is of that happie Countrey.
So great is the desire haue towards your seruice (soueraigne Venus, that it was able to bring in my aide, and your seruice no lesse then my deare Lord and Vnckle Don Eleno, Prince of Dacia.
Who had alreadie put off his Helme, discouering his excellent complexion, intreating the kissing of her white hand.
He that hath them so good (said she) is wronged, in not commaunding that honor of all the Orbe.
Now may liue content, knowing that the protectors of all necessities abides in my Court: And since in handling my affaires, you make me your euerlasting friend, know not why should not openly reueale my secrets to you, though to my cost, for it wil not discontent him who hath placed all felicitie so faithfully to loue.
And to this end, it wil be good the Prince of Dacia should goe to the suspitious knights lodging, that he may at large know, what hereaway hath happened.
To morrow wil send him one of my Damzels, to shewe it him.
For it behoues the Gréeke Prince to returne to prison, least he be mist.
With whatsoeuer your soueraigne bewtie shall commaund, will rest most contented.
For here now we only wil procure yours, although therein hazard my life.
hoped no lesse of such a knight (said she) for such as you in defending receiue no wrong, ought to shewe they be knights.
And hereupon they departed, appointing that with his Page and Dwarffe, he should go to the groue of Louers, whither they would aduise him by Fausta the next day what shall be done, and surely making the doore fast, she tooke the Gréeke Prince by the hand, saying.
am sorie renowned Prince to haue put you in so many daungers
but trust in the diuine powers, shall one day shewe my selfe not vngratefull: he answered.
Small is not the wrong receiue by those words, your soueraigne beautie being assured that if haue, or shall haue any content, it is onely to procure yours, and beléeue me, of little desert is the hazard of my life in so necessarie daunger, and so much the more, knowing that in Venus seruice, any perill is a pastime.
Ile suffer my self to be flattered herein (said she) that my beautie hath obtained so good credit.
And because thinke it is reason you returne to the Tower, heere put off your armour, for these will kéepe with me, to put me in reme~brance how much am indebted to their Maister.
With such grace she disarmed him, that she disgraced Cynthia in her pride, though then she séemed more faire, then when shee visited Endymion.
Hee tooke his leaue of the Ladie, and going through the Caue, they mounted the staires, where in his chamber hee found his trustie Polisandro, with the discréet Fausta; that expected him with some feare of his long tarrying, although they had not gréeued had he a little longer stayed, for the damzels wittie chat had attracted the Pages affection, and were they wise, they had not deferde the execution of their desires, since so good opportunitie the Gréeke had giuen them with his absence.
Galtenor doth not expresse it onely, saith: that when the Prince of Croacia went to ayde Greece, and carried Venus and Fausta with him, that she séeing Polisandro there knighted, was contented to bee made a Ladie, a manifest token for any suspected minde to thinke they had contracted it.
From thence went the damzell accompanied with Polisandro to Venus chamber, and returned to the Prince, closed the Caue after him, of whom he vnderstood the Dacian was the knight that helpt him.
Who being out of the garden, mounted on his swift Tirio, and alighted in the Forrest he was appoynted, whither he was directed (as one that well knew it) by the dwarffe, that with him and his Page in pleasant chat past away most part of the night, glad to haue occasion wherein he might helpe his cousin.
So the time to take some rest being come, he stept aside from them, and lying along the gréen grasse with his head on his helme, he slept the greatest part of the night, and
taking his shield, straight went towards that place, and comming to a spacious plaine, at the farther end thereof, he could discerne some shepheards that attended their flockes.
They were talking of their affaires, entermingling them with matters of Loue.
The haughtie Dacian arriued, and assuring them from the feare they conceiued by his comming, said.
Feare not gentle shepheards, for my comming is not to discontent you, saue onely throughly to heare your discourses of amorous cares.
One of them that séemed to commaund the rest, aunswered.
Wee very much estéeme (sir Knight) of the good opinion you haue of the Esclauonian shepheards, and beléeue me, there is no reason to conceiue the contrarie, especially of those that féede their flockes in the groue of Louers, for here with most efficacie doth Loue manifest his power vnto vs, because true loue should neuer bee wanting, from among these spreading mirtles, on whose leaues and growing barkes, is the life of those Louers written, to incourage him that languisheth, séeing what they suffered, whose deathes with their names, named this Groue.
Great occasion gallant shepheards, hath the hearing of this Groue béene (replied the Dacian to bring me hither from my farre remoted countrie, to knowe the aduenture thereof.
The shepheards did rest affected to him, séeing his behauiour: and some more precisely noting him, (hauing that day béene in the Cittie) knew him to bee one of the Knights that had with such honour ended the battell, so made aunswere.
To no place (sir knight) could you haue come, to haue more truer information of the thing you desire, then this, for beeing so long since we haue kept our flockes heerein, we haue learned of our elders why this valley is called of the Louers.
Whereto the Dacian saide: Why then should impute it a fauor (if it bee no trouble) to relate it me, wherein you shall perpetually binde me? In much more then this (replied the discréet shepheard) desire we to content yon, for your déeds this day done in Alantho, deserue farre much more.
So sat he downe among them, where the shepheard began his storie in this manner.
When here arriued the Author and builder of this great Cittie, and first King of this countrie, there inhabited on the highest toppe of this mountaine, a people whose quiet and pleasing dwelling through their excellent gouernment and care, brought it to bee the gallantest most pleasantest Town in althis kingdom.
Celio by name, the valiantest and of rarest constitution, then knowne in all the vniuerse, insomuch that he was called the Oracle of his age.
He had two brothers, the second named Alcyno, and the third Larsinio, they had a sister yonger then the~selues, but elder in beautie, which was such, that fro~ many places strangers came only to sée her perfeéeions, on whom some lost their liues at the very first sight.
This Ladie called Laissa, their Parents did consecrate to this Groue, dedicated to Diana, to administer to her rites in companie of her other vowesses, they brought her there so young, and she so much delighted in that solitude, giuing her selfe solely to hunt, that shee became so excéedingly obliuious of her Parents and kindred, that she procured by all meanes possible to occult her selfe from them, and all humane creatures: it was easie to be done by reason of the thicknesse and intricate passages of the same, which was no little ioy to her, thinking she liued neuer more to be séene of any.
This life did she lead till the age of fouretéene yeares: for then did her beautie staine the sunnes in his pride, whose fame the other Nimphes of the Temple published abroad throughout the spacious world.
One day among the rest, as Prince Celio accustomed to recreate himself, descending this way on hunting, he chansed to finde her neare a cleare fountaine that lies behinde this little hill, called the Vnfortunate, by reason of that which happened thereat.
Where Celio séeing her, and of such admirable beautie, blame him not if hée yéelded a thousand soules, (so many if he had) for much more deserued her excellencies and most gracious brauerie.
Hee went towards her, shewing by his alteration what he went for, and how estranged from himselfe he should depart, at the drawing of his attracted eies from her sight.
From her being, rose the solitarie Goddesse discontented, to haue met with that knight, who séeing her, disdaining coynesse, followed to ouertake her, stayning her with sighes that procéeded from the middest of his perplexed heart: but the frée Ladie carelesse of his cares, declared hers, in onely hasting her swift running steppes, turning her face, from whom acknowledged her for his Goddesse.
Shee could not so far outrunne him, but he at last ouertooke her, and catching holde by her thin sléeue, falling on his knées, began thus.
Oh sacred Ladie, why should you shew such crueltie against him that must liue onely to loue you, hoping for no longer life then you shal grant, admitting his deuotion? but oh, if you shall ioy to prosecute your strangenesse, let mee not prorogue your vengeance on my selfe.
While this dagger is readie to execute your sharpe decree, for so you do remaine without displeasure, it will be my pleasure to satisfie your doome with my death.
The crueltie (sir knight) you speake of, should vse towards my selfe? (replied the disdainfull Laissa should regard your prayers, knowing how Capitall the offence is against the chaste Diana, whose Nimphes (of whom being one) are first afore all other things sworn to the puritie of a single life? and so my selfe ioying in the swéetnesse of so choise a liuing as that led in solitude, should not then cruelly tyrannize ouer my coontent, procuring your ease, to loose my libertie? With many currents of pearled teares distilling from his eyes, the amourous Celio answered.
Neuer (sacred Goddesse) did my imagination so much as thinke by louing to worke my content, in any thing to abridge yours: onely beséech (and this is not to offend you) that though my merits deserue not your sight, nor my selfe be woorthie to adore you, may to nourish my else dying life, make you solely to my selfe, the sole commandresse of my oppressed soule, and that may repaire to your glorious name, with the tributarie duties of my poore hearts spoyles.
Somewhat milder grewe the sister of amorous Celio, for there is no Ladie so cruell and vnthankefull, but reioyces to be beloued, for such vertue doth loue set in the Ladie loued, that onely to deserue the gift to be beloued, shée will loue.
She would haue answered, but the comming of Alcyno the second brother interrupted her, who almost before hee sawe her, rendred his soule vnto her, as a pledge of his true loue.
The like sacrifice did the third make of hs, that then arriued, which two last séeing their brother, and with that Ladie, ere they knewe how to loue, exprest approoued tokens to be iealous.
What good fortune is this, (good brother) to méete with so gallant a Ladie in so solitarie a place? So haue the heauens appointed it my deare brother (replied Celio.
And being nothing iealous of them, to feare to say his minde, added: that the power of my thoughts béeing imployed on her, my soule may triumph in content to haue found such a Soueraigne.
Most woorthie is her beautie (saide the second) of the offer of my noble thought, whose reliques may solemnize her brauerie: neither is vnoccupied, for Loue doth occupie them all.
And if by chance all thrée be silent, she by mouing the Organs of her spéech, kindles the fire that vnconsumingly doth burne them.
Celio loues, and the mollified Lady looking on him, by the motions of her sunnes, with infinit signes of hopes, doth incourage him to persist in his moued sute: and for his sake, shée affects the other two, knowing they were his brethren.
She exprest it by her kind words, in answering them.
Such is the condition of loue (most bewteous Ladies, credit me, it is knowne by experience) that any amorous motion how fained soeuer, is accepted of the Louer, as a manifest token, that onely he, is he, soly beloued.
For as the Lady without straungenesse kindly spake to them, the more to winne Celio to her selfe, either of the others accounted themselues to be especially beloued.
The greatest part of the day continued they in pleasing that, intangling themselues in the snares of that deceiuing net, that there with thousand childish toyes did leape from bowe to bowe to insnare these poore Louers in their owne vnhappie conceits, vntil the withdrawing time of the recluse Goddesse called her away, which forced the thrée brothers to returne vnto their home, purposing euery day to come thither, in quest of whom they loued, yet minding to take their seuerall way.
For nothing was sufficient to disswade the two brothers that they were not beloued, to desist the prosecuting of their intented loues.
Sometimes after they spake with the Lady, not knowing nor remembring she was their sister: but she by all exterior meanes, told the two younger, she could admit none saue the elder.
Neuerthelesse, so possest was loue of the two brothers soules, that in such sort it blinded them, that they would neuer beléeue it was as she said, and their owne eyes sawe to be most true: for the perfect sincere loue which nourish them, caused them to deuise the expedients meanes to end their passionated labors.
They found it, and to their liues cost: for passing some moneths in this entertainment, one day, dismall and blacke to this Countrey (since so much calamitie fel on it) Larsinio the yonger brother hastened his comming to séeke his sister, clad all in rich shining armor.
He met with her at the vnhappie Fountaine (through their lucklesse euents so called) in whose bubbling Current shée was washing her faire white Alabaster
His Beuer lifted vp the Louer, and nimbly leaping from his horse, went straight towards the Founte.
To receiue him ranue the Ladie, guerdoning his comming with a louing imbrace, not as to her brother or Louer, but so neare in ally to him whom with heart she tendred, which the Prince attributed not to Celio in fauour, nor his consanguinitie to Laissa, saue to his owne pure loue, which was so great, that he iudged himselfe in respect of deseruer of that courtesie.
But Fortune now alreadie wearie, and angrie the earth should longer containe them, ordained Alcino should sée the imbracement, who not knowing his brother by reason he was armed, set spurres to his horse being also in armes.
The Louer closed his Vizor séeing the other come in that manner, and mounting on his horse, stept to him, saying.
What séeke you in such haste sir knight? Onely (replied the second brother) to let you know the little reason you had to offer violence vnto that Ladie.
Inraged, as well indéed he might, became the vnwary youth, and not supposing he was his brother, turned about his Courser, and saide.
Why then staie bolde knight, for this shall chastise thy rude rashe intention.
Alcino cowched his Launce, making their incounters with as much noyse, as if two shippes had met.
Of mightie forces were the youthes, and so they prosecuted their battle with as much strength as crueltie, that the Ladie which beheld them, could not but pittie the blowes which Larsinio receiued with some teares: for the loue she bore his brother, forced her to shead them.
The second brother closed with Larsinio, striking away at one stroke the halfe of his shield, wounding him sorely on the arme, which was occasio~ they cast eithers armes about the other, with such power, that both fell from their Saddles to the ground.
Striuing, vp and downe they tumbled on the grasse, bespringling the earth with their blood.
When the haughtie Celio arriued, who séeing the battle, not perceiuing the Ladie there, lept from his horse, and drawing forth his sword, went towards them and said.
In courtesie sir knights, cease a while your fights, which causelesse séemes to be so fierce.
Either was so flesht against the other, thinking the Lady offended by eithers action, that vnwilling to obey their elder brother, (that being also in rich abillements of warre was not knowne) Alcino made reply.
Doo not you sir knight séeke to part our Combat, whose cause we haue adiudged too sufficient.
Notwithstanding (said Celio for my sake and intreatie, hope you will leaue it.
It will be then (answered the youngest) to make you confesse you are discourteous, in wishing peace where none is desired.
And so he being got betwéene them, and they both angred togither, they discharged two such blowes vpon him, that he repented to haue vndertaken that demaund: but being of incomparable strength, quickly setled himselfe among them, beginning one of the fiercest fights in the world.
Aboue two houres they continued hacking, and without pittie cruelly cutting their armes and fleshe, that euery one had aboue eight wounds.
The Ladie feared some vnhappie chaunce, whose heart was so deliberated with feare to sée Larsinio so wounded (for the others shée knew not) that she could not rise, nor with her voyce giue notice shée was there: so we gaue occasion vnto the lamentablest and most vnluckie act that euer was acted.
For Celio weary of so long delay, defending himselfe of the second brother, with a cruell thrust to his thinking bereaft poore Larsinio of his life, whose death so extreamly gréeued Alcino, (as if he had knowne him) that dispairing of life, did cast his shield to the ground, and closed with his brother, who doing the like, so long wrasled, that both fell to the earth, where drawing foorth their daggers, with equall blowes either stabbed in the others bodie togither at once, loosing their vitall breathing, to the Ladies so great sorrow, that she thought to burst.
She rose, bewayling that accursed happe, and went to Larsinio, tooke off his Helme, and séeing him like one dead, she became more then dead.
Néedes would shée know the others, which was cause of greater euil, for their Helmes being off and knowne who they were, a thousande lamentations did shée breathe into the aire, banning her misfortune.
Shée fell in a traunce, and twise or thrise lost the motion of her mouing powers, and at length recouering her selfe, and seeing the thrée Princes, for her sake with such remorselesse sauadgenesse slaine, tearing the golden tramels of her amber haire, whose bewtie eclipsed Apollos light, thus she began her lament.
Oh cruel heauens, wherein haue deserued this mortal plague? Or how haue offended, you should so much maligne my hopes, to oppose your happie influences with such dire euent, against the springing of my ioyes? Had you suffered me to kéepe my life within the limits of my solitary walks, these Princes had not séene me, and so not viewing my ill bestowed bewtie, they had not desired what soly was due to one.
Oh deare Princes, you should haue bene contented to see your brother beloued, and your selues for his sake affected, to desist the procurement of your pleasure, with his, and your owne deaths.
Oh chaste Goddesse, why didst thou suffer so execrable a fact, hatefull, abhorred and detestable were my life vnto the world, should desire to liue, that sawe the timelesse end of your vnripe yeares.
For this, oh this vaine momentary fading bewtie! How, oh how may she (valiant Princes) recompence this déed, this deare and amorous déed, but to immitate you in death, that did Idolatrize me in life? Reason had Tysbe to suffer for her Louer, and Hero, rather to taste of the bitter waters of death, then of the actiue fire of loue, that in her entrailes burned.
None had such reason to die as I: and in speaking it, to prolong my despised life, doo offend: which though might, will not enioy, in absence of those thrée that did so dearly loue me.
Thrée liues wold haue heroike Princes, to bestow on either one, being debter vnto you for thrée, but since cannot, to thée swéete Celio, my soule and heart doo bequeath: my good will and affection to Alcyno and Larsinio, and my poore chaste life, with my immaculate and vnspotted thoughts, to thée most sacred Goddesse do sacrifice, in extenuation of my fault.
Wherevpon with mortall fury she drew Celios sword, and setting her brest to the sharpe point, she offered her life to deaths tryumphing spoiles.
Which no sooner was effected, but the blew heauens with thicke fogs and mysts was clowded, with thundring and lightning, and innumerable horrible voyces, that strooke deadly terror in the harmelesse people, who with their flockes and heards of cattle, perished.
Their bodies were neuer found, nor if is not knowne what is become of them, more then that their liues and deaths, with the maner and occasion, was found carued in carrecters vpon some Okes there adioyning, where some shepheards haue often séene a Caue, from whence issues such flames and smoake, that it consumed the Trées neare to it, and it is many yeares, since none dares through feare let their flocks féed thereabouts.
This is (sir knight) what you haue demaunded, and of so many reports the truest: where the shepheard ended.
Naturally was the Prince couragious and desirous of such aduentures, and so very earnest did he inquire for the Caue, determining to enter and see what it contained.
The shepheards shewed it him more to content him, then to thinke he would aduenture to descend thither.
But being hard by it, with inuincible courage (in the end like Don Eleno hee tolde them his will.
They sorrowed thereat, with no fewe teares they sought to disswade him from it, yet nothing could put him from his purpose, respecting neither theirs, Fabios, nor his dwarffes intreaties: but drawing foorth his sword, and taking his inchaunted shielde, hee recommanded himselfe to his heauenly Protector, and them to expect his returne, and so directed his steppes towards the infernell Caue, where what happened him, the next recounteth.
V. How Don Eleno proued the aduenture of the Louers, and what end he gaue it.
And how in Xantho he made a challenge about the two Princes liberties.
WIth Brutus sword in hand, and his new inchanted shield, with maiestick steps marching towards the timorous caue, (most kind Ladie) left we the Dacian Prince, with whom neither the intreaties of his Pages nor shepheardes, preuailed to giue ouer his commenced enterprise: neither the necessitie wherein he knew he had left his deare Cosin Claridiano, the beautious Venus, with the Prince of Croacia, for his desire to knowe what that feareful caue contained, made him dispence with all these, and drowne the memorie of his owne affaires in the center of obliuion.
So with Herculian courage committing his safetie to the powers diuine, he beganne to enter the Caue, that rather séemed an infernall descent vnto the hellish vawtes, so much, and so furious was the fire that thither welcommed him: from vtter burning by
those consuming flames did dispairing Brutus inchaunted armor defend him: yet neuerthelesse felt he the greatest paine in all his life: for besides innumerable number of horrible voyces that sounded within that hollownesse, many thousand hideous deformed shapes and apparitions opposed themselues against him, with stéeled mases hammering on his bodie, with such seleritie, that sometimes his handes, then his knées, and sometimes both, he was forced to sit on the ground: insomuch that his own blows wherwith he strook the emptie aire, serued to no other purpose, but with the fruitlesse exercise to wearie his arme, that he could not féele it.
In this vneuen warre labored he about an houre, minding many times to returne backe, so erterne hot was the fier, but surprised with consideration of whom hee was, and what ignominious infamie awaighted such an act, with much striuing hee obtained the ende of the burning Caue, where he met with a great Piller, which nothing displeased him, that by getting behinde it, might defend him from his pursuers.
But here was he in the greatest daunger of all his life time, for the Piller he imbraced, became a most fearefull Gyant, who so strongly prest him, that he thrust his armor within his flesh, and the flames being no lesse, that from him procéeded, then those he indured thitherward.
Hee strongly stayed himselfe, remembring whom hee had to doo with, and casting his mightie armes about him, turned him vp and downe as if hee had béene some common Knight, till angered that so long that wrasts had lasted, hee hoysed him from the ground, and with the vtmost of his strength ranne him against the wall, that terminated the Caue.
Scarce had he done it, when vanishing, in his place he loft a doore, through which with vncontrowled minde he entred, comming into a fresh delightsome gréene, with such different varietie of trées in such artificiall order set, that the sight eased him of his past toyle.
At one end thereof he sawe a sumptuous building, séeming not by humane hands erected, for the top raised like to a Pyramide, séemed to checke the clowdes in height, and as the same reuerberated on the glittering stones, the great splendor thereof dazeled the beholders eyes.
At the entrance thereof stood thrée pines, to support so many Arches, vnder which lay three Knights, which séemed to defend the entrie.
The one and biggest in constitution of bodie, was cladde in Indian colour armour,
And on his shielde, that hung at the trée, was figured the portrature of Faith, with this word.
On earth if any honour bee, All tride honour comes by mee.
The other two were alike in skie colour armes, full of strawberies, and on their shields Enuie pictured with many eyes, as the Assirians vsed to paint her, the inscription thus.
Enuies seruants thousands are, All which mischiefes do deuise: Then to looke on each ones care, Enuie must haue many eyes.
All thrée shewed themselues to be of valour, which made the Dacian Lord imagine (as indéed they were).
Before the Arches there was made a horse race, at the beginning whereof, hung a Table with these words, whose meaning Don Eleno read thus.
In the time to come, when the most happiest in Loue, and with whom Fortune hath shewed her selfe most fauourable, shall here arriue, then this aduenture of the Louers shall haue ende: and also the torments that Laissa suffers: for so hath Nycosiano the great Magician of the Greene valley ordered.
Plainly did the Dacian perceiue, that the Table spake by him, since through so many misfortunes he had arriued to so happie a Hauen, as the inioying of his beautious Rosamonde.
With gallant Maiestie he entred the race, being confronted by the younger of the thrée brothers.
The rest séeing the warre offered them, mounted on their Coursers preparing for it, as they which had no more iudgement, but for that, Iudge of the battell néeds would Cupid be, the mightie K. of Sowles and Hartes, sitting in all royaltie on a Imperiall throne, for workemanship stupendious, shewing himselfe (his eyes not blinded) with irefull aspect.
At his féet lay prostrated all those that had rebelled against his decrée.
But they which had maintained his statutes, and obserued his laws, and with vaine Idolatrie adored his rights, sate round about in royall chaires, euerie one in his degrée, according to the supremacie of his deserts: and with most care of obedience acknowledging his feoltie, repairing to him with the due tribute of his soule, as to their true sworne Prince.
The signall of the fight was giuen with so many thousandes of militarie instruments, as if heauen and earth should méete.
Whereat swifter then an ayrie thought, the warrelike warriour prickt against Larsinio, incountring him with such strength, that he forced him loose his stirropes and bridle, had almost ouerthrown him from his saddle.
With braue gallantnesse past the Dacian forwards, turning vpon his aduersarie with his naked sword in his hand, but scant had he done so, when quicker then the winde, the second brother spurde against him, running at his backe with such force, that had he not held by his horse necke, he had kist the ground.
He had not done executing this blow, when like a thunderbolte the mightie Celio departed to him, méeting him (after the breaking of his launce) so forcibly with his horses breast, that both tumbled to the ground.
On his féete fell the Dacian, amazed at the knights deuise: who gaue him no longer time for this consideration, for the two that on horsebacke remained, returned to ouerthrow him.
Hee could not defend himself, for the course was short, and so headlong they ouerturned him.
Ere he could rise, Celio stept to him, with the greatest blow he had in al his life receiued, for it had almost strooke him sencelesse, laying him all along vpon the earth.
All this was no meanes to put the Dacian from his skilfull procéeding, for ere he could second another, like a furious Lyon he rose on his féet, resolued to expect them.
Hee sawe himselfe in daunger of death, for the two that remained on horsebacke, (with quicke and suddaine carriers) so opprest him, as he lost his hope, with honour to issue out of that enterprise.
thing worthie his valour he did, for his shield forwards, he expected Larsinio, that to incounter him had aduanced himselfe, but no more he mooued him, then if he had runne against a rock, whom with his horse staggering back, the Dacian forced to fall, whereat the Prince was glad, knowing
So he stept aside, letting Alcino passe, and as he went, gaue him such a thrust, which was it that assured him the victorie, making him therewith, maugre his strength, to leaue his saddle.
For all this he had no cause to boast of the blowe: for the inraged Celio ranne to him with both hands laying on his rich helme, the temper gaue him his life, else had his head downe to his necke béene diuided, yet made he the blood in great abundance gush through his nose.
By this were the other two vp with their swords in hand.
It was a combat most worthie Cupids sight, for the thrée are mightie, and the Dacian the same he was woont, and a foote stronger then Mars, hée shewed himselfe like a cunning fencer, setting forth at length his shield and sword, to intice them to make offer.
Herein hee preuailed, for most blowes he receiued on his shield, which being inpenetrable, they did not so much as race it.
In this manner a while he behaued himselfe, but hee iudged it cowardise so to end the battell: wherefore brauely he rusht among them, well couering himselfe with his shield, and as hee past, he gaue the second brother such a counterbuffe on the helme, striking away a great part of his vizor that it was aduenture he had not done so by his head.
Downe along the breast descended the sword, making there a long daungerous wound, with another he would haue ended that battell, had the other two let him.
But the haughtie Celio with impoysoned rage entred so much inwards, that at his pleasure hee could discharge his furie on the toppe of the inchaunted shield, not able to cut it, yet so waightie was the blow, that thrée or foure steppes staggering backwards, it forced him.
Larsinio was not ydle, for with a strong point he thrust at his brest.
He felt the blow, for it depriued him of his breaths passage.
The two brothers had not discharged their blowes, when the wounded Alcyno returned, and with both hands gaue him a most mightie stroke.
Rezound with Eccho did the gréene fields, by the warriors sterne stupendious blowes.
And the angrie Iudge was astonished to sée with what crueltie they assayled each other.
Aduantage had the warrelike Dacian in his armour, for though he was tired, yet they had no scarre.
Otherwise was it with the brothers, for the fielde was besprinkled with their blood.
much auailed him, else he had not got the victorie so cheape, but it and the surenesse of his armes, makes it certaine.
Thrée houres haue they fought, making no shewe of fainting, in the end of which, was the Dacian alreadie at the extreamest of his rage, thinking he had ye worst of the fight, so casting his shield at his backe, and with his sword twixt both hands, began to brandish it among them, quicker then the Cyclopian Smithes doo their crooked hammers, and as he could not misse them, he gaue no blowe but fetcht blood.
In the selfe same Coyne doo they paie him: for the thrée more fiercer then Alcydes, assayled him so brauely, that if he giues, he receiues, and in greater quantitie, with equall quallitie.
Now skill and dexteritie preuailes not with him, all he remits to blowes, wherewith he rents, cuts, and in péeces shiuers their armor, priuy coates and shields.
He would first dispatch Celio which most troubled him, so getting from the two, entered to him, and in his assault, with a downright blowe he cut away his shield, with al his vanbrace, and a great péece of his shoulder.
Scarce had he done it, whe~ with a point he turned against the second, thrusting thrée parts of his sword vnder his arme pit, where had he put foorth his arme as he mought, for euer had he there laine.
Vpon Larsinos waste he discharged his furie so fiercely, that it was a wonder he had not in two diuided him.
The heauens preserued him to paie his iealousie, although against the Dacian Prince he lost thereby.
In his very soule was Celio vext, to sée with what rygor that one knight handled them, that taking his sword strongly in his fist, aymed aloft, giuing Alcyno time to giue him a dangerous blow on the thigh: for falling betwéene a ioynt, it made him a wound outwards: so great was the paine, as he could not stand on that legge, which the brothers perceiuing, and assuring themselues the victory, began to oppresse him so vehemently, as they depriued him of breathing.
Eager herein séemed the third brother, and would make some shewe of his valour, but it rezulted to his deare cost.
For Don Eleno noting his intent, gaue back, as fearing the rest, and so let ye third enter: who being within his reach, with incredible force laide him on the head, he cut away most of his Helme, with a great péece of his head, tumbling him at his féete, helping him thereto, with another no lesse strong.
dagger, quickly they fell on the ground, where they tumbled a good while.
It was aduantage for the Dacian to be so, for stretching foorth his arme in that place where before Alcyno was wounded on ye front, there againe Don Eleno strooke him, making him loose his hold, with the pangs of death.
Then he turned on the first, whom for his valour he had affected, but at that instant forgetting it, let flie at his brest a most cruell stabbe, wherewith he ended the brauest aduenture euer in that kingdome knowne.
The noyse which the haughtie edefice made, vanishing away, was heard through all the Citie of Xantho.
To Cupids Throne was the Ladie conueyed, in that manner, as she witnessed her brothers deaths: whom the God of loue thanked for her amorous act, in giuing her selfe the mortall stroke of death, only mooued through zealous loue, for which hee promised her felicitie in her amours.
Against the two brothers that were causers of that vnhappy euent, was the sentence read to this effect.
To the purgatorie of Iealousie and Enuie let them be carried, where they may purge the paine that their rash vnaduised procéedings did put the famous Celio in.
Whom the mightie Iudge commaunded to be sent vnto the house of Hope, where he might liue in ioy, and sure he should obtaine a glorious and amorous ende, deserued by his faith, and that the remembrance of louing his sister, should not annoy him.
This being done in presence of the Dacian, who vnable to stirre, with many flashes of lightning, the heauens were somewhat darkened, till all was past, he founde himselfe in the open field, hard by the bewteous Layssa, and before them a Piller of fire, with these words which Don Eleno did read in this maner.
The Purgatory of Enuiers shall here remaine, iustly punishing the two Louers: til the sonne of the cruell Lyonesse shall giue them libertie: Discouering also the Castle of Hope: whose wonders shall not be by any seene, till the foure most fiercest Lyonesses shal meet at this Fount.
So greatly desired the Prince to see the scrole, that hee sawe not the Ladie, till turning about, hee spyed her come towardes him a pace, alreadie assured of the true manner of this successe, and how she was sister to the dead: yet knowing they remained but inchaunted, ioyfully going neare him, said.
knowe not (most soueraigne knight) how may satisfie the dutie you haue bound me too, in hazarding your life for me in so manifest a perill: although so braue a déed as this, brings with it his due recompence.
It is sufficient (excellent Ladie) answered the Prince, that it bée knowne, did you therein some seruice, which bound all the world (seeing what wrong you indured, being kept heere) to procure the remedie.
The comming of the shepheards, Squire and Dwarffe, intercepted their farther spéech.
Euerie one did their dutie to the Prince and Ladie.
Whom Don Eleno receiued, as if he had not in a long time seene them.
At this time entred the same an infinit number of knights, accompanying the king and the Prince Lindauro, that galloped amaine to know the newes.
The shepheards aduanced themselues, for reward of the newes, saying: that the russet knight which had ended the battel in the Cittie, had terminated the
It greatly gladded euery one for Laissas disinchauntment: though being done by Don Eleno, it nothing pleased the king, that in his heart did hate him.
By this approached the Dacian on his mightie Tyrio, bringing the Lady behinde him, so faire, that she affected euery one, and had not Lindauro borne so great good will towards Venus, doubtlesse he had elected her his Goddesse.
The King entertained him with better exterior shewe, then inward minde, thanking him for the good he had done in his kingdome.
The Dacian would not (after hee had replyed with his becomming dutie) treat of any thing touching the prisoners liberties, but rather deuised other matter of discourse, till they all fixed their eyes on a gallant Knight, that descended downe the valley so well armed, that it delighted euery one.
None there but gazed on him, and the Ladie with somewhat more earnestnesse: and with affection beganne to commend his brauerie.
He was mounted on a mightie Rone Courser, his armor of a Tawnie, garnished with many gréene flowers, which brauely became him.
His shield about his arme, in middest whereof was a
knight lying along, laying foorth his breasts to Cupid, that with a dart angerly séemed to threaten him with this Motto.
Strike home, the Gods will sure his woorth commend, Who spoyles a wretch, that wants meanes to defend.
His launce he carried in his hand, and with such heroicke grace, that excepting the knights which ended the battell, they had not séene any of better disposition.
Approaching and doing his dutie to the king, he straight knew Don Eleno by his deuise, which not a little pleased him to méete him in those partes, for he himself was the mightie Bransmiano, Prince of Babilon, Florions Nephew, and sonne to Brandizel, and hee that in Grecia was chosen for the third chalenger of the Imperiall Iousts, and going with his father to Babilon, was separated from him by a tempest.
The youth was not in loue, but came in the last condition of béeing, for turning about and looking on that Ladie, in recompence of his sight, hee gaue her both heart and soule, and yet complained of himselfe to haue giuen her no more, iudging her beautie to deserue farre more.
The king demaunded who he was, ioying that such a knight should arriue at his Court.
But he excused himselfe the best hee could, imagining that his discouerie might displease the Dacian.
The king would not séeme to importune him ouer much therein, so turning about, returned with all his traine to the Cittie.
It was alreadie knowne in euerie place what had happened, Venus had aduertised the Greeke thereof, who was excéeding glad of his Vncles aduenture.
All the popularitie entertained the Dacian with loude salutations of immortall praises, saying: Long liue the knight that hath so honoured our land.
It so vext Lindauro, that a thousand times he was about to command them to silence, but he dissembled it to conceale his euill intent.
So neare went the new Persian Louer to Laissa, that all full of affection, he tooke occasion to speake thus.
With reason may your soueraigne beautie complaine of all knights, for being so remisse in procuring your libertie, that they might loose theirs.
The Ladie well vnderstood him, for shee was skilfull in the Art of Loue, and now againe beginning therein, plainly coniectured the end, so replying to the purpose, saide.
Of my selfe may most lament (sir knight) to be borne with such lacke
of fortune, that rather attribute my long imprisonment to it, then to the fault of straunger knight, for being ended by this knight, that was the first which prooued it, it might haue happened so to any other, wherefore am solely gréeued with mine owne misfortune: and sorry would be, that my libertie should cause such losse as you speake of, for would haue none complaine of wrong by me.
They arriued at the Pallace, where the beautious Laissa lighted in the armes of the Prince of Babylon, being led by the aydes of Don Eleno and Bransiniano, which content not a little increased her beautie.
More fairer then the sunne in May Venus expected her comming.
They embraced one another with that kindnesse that befitted their estates, wherevpon the Princesse said.
knowe not soueraigne Lady, to whom this Court shall be hereafter most bound vnto, whether to this knight, that with his valour hath so honoured it, liberating you from so iniust prison, or to your excellencie, that so hath beautified it.
Most beauteous Princesse, bee assured that whilest you liue, there will want none that shall bee in your debt, lesse then with his life, since you attribute to me, what onely is due with such right to this Ladies beautie, in whose deliuerance the ending of this aduenture was nothing.
Readie to burst with anger stood Lindauro, séeing with what kindnesse Venus spake to that knight, which made him suspect his ending the aduenture, and what he had done in the place, had mooued her to affection.
He could no longer indure it, but called him, saying.
Come (sir Knight) and relate vnto the King what befell you with the Louers, for we shall all reioyce to heare it.
From the Ladies he went, leauing the Persian with them, betwéen whom they admitted him: for which place, Phoebus had exchanged his throne celestiall.
Venus while Don Eleno discoursed with the kings, demaunded of him in this manner.
Sir knight, quietly and without grudge, if you will enioy so great a fauour as this, you must tell vs your name, raising your beauer, and this small satisfaction shall satisfie so high a benefit? The Persian replied.
had ere this done it (sacred Princesse) without demaunde, but feared to displease thereby the knight in russet: for although hée hath not knowne me, could not haue met with better hap then him in this countrie, and if he bee here knowne, will declare my name,
onely am she (of all this kingdome containes, said Venus that knowes him, and he not a little ioyed, discouered himselfe to me: and so without feare may you tell me yours, for this Ladie and my selfe excepted, none shall euer knowe it.
To satisfie your content (excellent Ladie answered he) Ile no longer conceale it, am Bransiniano, Prince of Babylon and Persia, the greatest friend the Gréekes haue, by reason my father was brought vp in company of the Emperour Alphebo, and in Claridianos, in whose demaund wander, as this knight is his so neare kinsman, cannot but affect him: and had not this reason, yet his valour bindes me to his loue: and raising his vizor, shewed his faire face, saying.
Because you shall be assured (diuine Ladies) how much desire your seruice, haue discouered all that of my selfe can.
do highly estéeme (braue Prince replied Venus the account you haue giuen me of your stocke, and because will not long be your debtor for the same, will giue you newes of that Gréeke you séeke, who in this Pallace is prisoner, vnknowne to any what he is, saue to the Prince of Dacia and me, who shall at large acquaint you with the cause, which is not lawfull any other should know: and so intreate your soueraigne beautie, my deare Laissa, to conceale it.
So eleuated in contemplations of her new amorous thoghts, was the Lady, that neither it, nor what else was talked of, did she marke, for of none did euer loue with more power take possession, willingly making her submit, séeing how great a Prince he was.
greatly desire (excellent Princesse) that since your knight hath recounted to them their demaundes, he doo it heere to vs. Venus knew not to what end shee so replied, but being wittie, quickly conceiued what might be the reason, so dissembling it, said.
There is no reason but we should bee satisfied herein.
So calling their Damzell Fausta, sent her in their behalfe to Don Eleno.
But they could not end to giue her her charge, by reason of a suddaine tumult that arose where the king was.
The Persian hearing it, stood vp, and closing his beuer, taking leaue of the Ladies, went towards the Dacian, at what time somewhat mooued, hee thus beganne.
Gladly (most mightie king of Esclauonia would haue deferde vntill some other occasion, what will now say, because would not disturbe this present ioy.
But so great is the necessitie haue to depart, that it forceth me to beseech thee, in respect of the iustice thou haste alwaies maintained, thou wouldest be pleased to giue me the prisoners, whose libertie cost me so much blood, and my companion much more, whose words haue not suffered him to come with me, although he requested me should on his behalfe, intreate so much of his Maiestie, since as it séemed you rested content, wee should about their discharge vndertake the battell.
Consider it well, and answere me straight, for will immediately depart, publishing the iniustice haue in thy Court receiued, through all the world.
Well (said the king) he had reason, but he was so subborned by the Prince Lindauro, that to please him, he chose rather to reiect it, answering: know (braue knight) you haue reason to demaunde these prisoners, but séeing they slew such great Princes, whose kindred crying out for iustice, forceth me to detaine them.
To this saide Lindaura, your Maiestie doth wrong your royall Crowne and seat, by so many waies, and in so many respects, to giue this knight so many satisfactions of what with great right and iustice is done.
These words so inraged the Dacian, that hee was almost resolued to strike him, but hee staied himselfe, not willing to raise the whole Hall vppon him, so hée replied.
It better would beséem thée Prince of Siconia to make known thy valour, defending thy owne iustice with thy proper person, by honourable meanes, and not by so infamous a manner.
And that thou maist know what wrong is done me, here alone challenge the fight against two knights, whom thou shalt appoynt about this matter, or if thou wilt like a good knight accept my gage, defie thée, person to person, giuing thée aduantage for the combat, (that thou mayest sée and know my iustice) will combat on foote in armour, without weapons, as sword, dagger, and launce, and thou shalt take the fielde, and haue thy choise in armes.
So great was the aduantage, that it was able to turne a tender Lambe vnto a fierce Lyon, and not regarding his honour, hee did accept it presently, from which the king could not disswade him.
None in the Hall, except the Babylonian Prince, but iudged the knights challenge to procéed of meere madnesse.
Don Eleno as he had done nothing, demaunded the battell to be straight, first requiring the prisoners to be brought in field.
The Gréeke was nothing astonished thereat, well knowing the fury of his vncle.
The prisoners surely guarded, were conducted to a Scaffold of purpose made for such matters.
They gréeted one another as their affection did deserue, with ioy, hoping for the good successe of the battel.
On foote did the Dacian enter the fielde without any weapon: which the Prince of Persia carried, and his page ledde his horse to giue it.
The Combat ended, with a leape did the furious gallant take the Lists, compassing it about with such quicke paces, as he were mounted.
Then stood he still, gladly gazing how the Citie did vnpeople it selfe to sée the Combat.
The Ladies with their bewties made that place a Paradice, although Venus Layssa feared, séeing the Prince in so doubtfull a fight.
Without any such thought expected he the comming of his enemies, whose entrance, the next capitulateth.
The battle that past betweene the two Princes, with the end thereof.
IF at any time (swéete Ladies, wonders of this times bewtie) my Prince and Don Eleno, had néed of your fauours, this it is, for without shall be forced abruptly here to stoppe, and he thinking that it failes him, no maruell if he feare his aduersary, that at one end of the place appeared, as wel furnished with armes weapons, as with pride, mounted on a mightie white Courser, his Armor was gréene, with many harts all incompassed with flames of fire.
In midst of his shield were two Harts enchayned, with this word.
Both are due to her varitie, For modest grace, and chiefest bewtie.
Of gallant co~stitution séemed the Pagan, with the great companies that accompanied him, euerie one assured of his conquest, séeing him with such aduantage: besides, reputing him of forces inuincible.
They equalled the sunne betweene them, an auncient martiall custome in warres of that qualitie.
Oh Don Eleno, who might sée thée on foote without weapons, fearelesse awaight the comming of thy valiant aduersarie, who at the fearefull trumpets sound prickt foorth, making the earth with hoarse noise eccho the trampling of his horses hoofes.
The Dacian stayed for him couragiously, onely fearing the incounter in the closing of the horse.
Leaping aside, he made him loose the blow, and with such furie passe foorth his carrier, that his shield had almost leapt out of the lists.
Twise was he so serued, but the third he changed of purpose, for brandishing with mightie force the launce with such seleritie, he cast it at him, that his was not sufficient to make him shun the receiuing it vpon his amorous breast, it could not pearce it, for that onely Loue had done, so making him a little stagger backe, while it rebounded backe.
Oh admirable act, in the end worthie the Dacian Lord: for with more furie taketh not the towring Eagle her flight after her pray, then doth Don Eleno follow the retorted lance, he tooke it in the ayre, and turned merely vppon the Pagan, at him hee let it flie with more horror, then had it béen sent through a cannons mouth.
Against his strength there is no defence, for it plainely pearced his shield, wounding him very dangerously below the nauell, with a mightie fall hee made him measure his length on the earth, with such astonishment of the beholders, that they knew not what meanes to finde to praise the knights valour.
The lance was broken in two, which did not a little content the Prince, he tooke it vp quicker then the rauenous kite snatcheth the tender chicke.
By this came Lindauro, with his shielde and sword in hand, thinking quickly to ende the fight, and with a florish would haue strooke the Dacian, entring with a thrust: As sure of his armes as of his strength was the Prince, so standing fast on his féete, suffered him to enter.
Great was the blowe he receiued, but hee with the trunchion in hand gaue him one, that set all former ones in obliuiou, for bringing the lances péece right ouer his head vppon the helme, discharged it so puissantly, that voyding infinit blood throgh his nostrels and mouth, he tumbled him headlong to the ground.
Suddainly he arose, for it was no time of delaies.
But he was met wit an other, that almost had againe feld him.
Neuerthelesse would not the Pagan doubt the victorie, and drawing strength from weaknesse, let flie at the toppe of the Dacians helme, it turned his an one side more then he wisht.
Enter he wold with another, but ere he could sway his sword about, the Prince made him feele the forcible waight of his trunchion, therewith making his shield and head méete, that it stopt the passage of his breath.
Close he would with him, but the Pagan brauely set his sword in the middle, with the poynt against him, and thrust him away so strongly, that he was forced backe thrée or foure steppes.
He followed him with a blowe on the helme, which put the Dacian to some paine, but all redowned to the Pagans harme, for Don Eleno being now extreamly incensed, avoyded another, and closed with him, casting his strong arme about his necke.
while continued they wrasling, but in the end, with a grone the Dacian laide him on the ground vpon his backe.
Dead art thou Prince Lindauro, vnlesse thou doest vnsay what thou haste said, commaunding the prisoners to bee brought hither and set at libertie, with their horses, armes, and weapons, since against all lawe and iustice they haue been so long detained.
All is ended with my vanquishment (replied the afflicted Saracin.
The Dacian intreated the Iudges to come and take the Pagans confession, who sent vnto the King to liberate the knights, with all that was theirs, since his fortune was so aduerse against him.
Their horses and armes being brought in presence of them all, they were armed.
Where with great kindnes the Persian offred his loue to the Gréeke, for as great amitie grew betwéene them, as euer was among their fathers.
was assured (gallant Prince) could nor should not receiue any good without your presence: my good will deserues it, for in all things it shall procure your content.
Great is that receiue (heroicke Prince) to haue found the time wherein might enioy your sight, and far greater should haue conceiued, had taken part of the troubles was tolde you indured: although where this happie Prince hath imployed his power, my little indeuor were but néedlesse.
acknowledge my selfe so bound vnto you al (replied Claridiano that will protest no more, saue that you in desire, and this Prince in dooing, haue accomplisht the dutie of your valours, and fulfilled my expectation.
But let vs now go to take our leaues of this peruerse malicious people, on whom vow ere depart from Esclauonia, to be fully reuenged at my pleasure, and their dammage.
All foure that were the flower of armes, went togither to the window, where the king was, to whom that euerie one might heare, the suspitious knight, spake thus.
am very sorry (king of Esclauonia in thy Court to haue séene so many tumultuous brawles, where had you obserued and vnwronged kept euery ones iustice, according to the fame that for so iust a king doth so blazon you, to be throughout the spacious territories of the worldes wide regions, they had not procéeded so farre foorth, although these knights and my selfe may truely say, that if we displeased thée, thou haste at pleasure satisfied thy selfe, to the deare cost of our quiet, putting in daunger the liues of such knights, a thing that the very hearing doth offend, how much the more hauing taken so vniust reuenge, guiding thy selfe thereto by a blinde selfe voluntarie passion, and not by royal, wise, and discréet reason.
And least thou shouldest hereafter pretend ignorance, knowe thou haste iniuried such Princes, that will straightly call thée to strickt account of all these wrongs.
Of whence, or what you be, and of your pride and insolencie, we néede not care to know, (said the king) for it manifestly appeares in your last committed faults.
And that you may sée how little respect your haughtie menaces, commaund you on paine of death, to depart my kingdome within these foure daies, if not, Ile séek, till the death pursue you with an hoste of armed men.
Before this had wee determined our departure (replied Pollidolpho abhorring longer to abide in Court, whose king so little doth respect true iustice: and so do hope to sée the time thou shalt thy selfe confesse the euil committed, to be ruled by the opinion of self passionate men, whom fortune hath rewarded according to their malicious intent.
Plainly vnderstood Lindaura it was ment by him, but vrgent necessitie was betwéene them, that he durst not speake.
They departed from the king, leauing him readie to burst with rage, and Lindaura in the same manner, that had no other comfort,
but to thinke his estate sufficient to warre against the whole world.
He required since all matters were quietted, to be married to the Princesse Venus.
The Father could not denie it, being pleased therewith, nor the Lady might not recall her word giuen to obey him, although she deferred the day, alleadging she and her damzels were working certaine things against that time, which forced her to deferre it eight or tenne daies, for séeing they were assured of her graunt, that terme was little.
Her father reioyced, and much more the dishonoured Louer of Liconia, to sée that for all his troubles and vnhappie chances, he obtained his Venus.
Who altogither of a contrary desire, sought meanes how to aduertise the Prince, and to conferre with them of her resolution.
The Gréeke well knew it, who being without the Cittie, taking some rest at the fountaine, although it was some to be at libertie, and in the company of such friends as those, on whom for their valors a greater matter then that, and difficulter might be reposed: He expressed his determination thus.
So great is my soules ioy (mightie Princes of Dacia and Babylon that my tongue cannot expresse it, in that it pleased the reuoluing Mistresse of vnconstant time, to order your commings hither, for otherwise what the Prince of Grecia promised, without your handes had béene impossible for him to atchiue.
Before the king imprisoned mee, my helpe was craued by his daughter, against the force her father would commit, to match her with a husband she disliked, to whom offered my person, so did this warlike Prince of Croatia, louing (as her beautie doth deserue no lesse) the faire Venus, and of himselfe he made her sole Empresse.
well perceieud it, presuming more then my strength could beare, promising to set her in his handes, in despight of the Syconian Sophy, to whom she is assured by the king, because hée is so great a Lord.
In prison talking with her, and telling her my opinion, she altogither yéelded thereto, and that shee would in nothing contradict me.
So must now go to her presence, and resolue her of my intent, that according to our time limitted, wee may vse the most conuenientest remedie.
do therefore intreate your aduise and counsell in these waightie affaires: The Dacian thus replied.
knowe none here (excellent Prince, that will deny his ayde vnto so mightie a Lord, as the Prince of Croatia, and therefore there is no reason, but
we all hazard our liues to woorke his content, and moreouer it behooues me to take from hence the bewteous Laissa, for hauing bought her libertie at so beare a rate, wil not leaue her in a straungers power: for intende to intreate the Prince of Persia to carry her vnto his Empire, til otherwise doo purpose: and the company of so braue a Lady will be gréeuous to none.
And since we be héere togither, am of opinion that the Prince of Greece goe to night to knowe the Ladies resolution, and against when they will bee readie to depart thence.
cannot most excellent Warriours, and soueraigne Princes, protest, nor binde my selfe to more then haue alreadie, only this, can within two dayes, haue heere twelue thousande men that expect my comming to the sea, that til commaund them the contrary wil not depart from thence.
And within the Citie haue fiftie knights and two Gyants to helpe vs if we shall néede their aide.
And we may safely vnséene go to our lodging in the Citie, and there order our businesse.
Euery one was glad that the Prince was so well prouided, and lest longer delaie should prooue more harmefull, they straight mounted, and tooke their way backe towards the Citie.
They entred vnto their lodging vnséene of any, through the obscuritie of the night.
From thence they sent two of the chiefest of the fiftie knights, to poste to the Sea side, to commaund the Captaines and Leaders of the souldiers, that euery Commaunder should leade the most and best of their charge vnto the Valley of the Louers, and that the rest should be in vigilant readinesse, guarding the Gallies.
The knights obeyed most willingly, as they that intirely loued their Prince, being also of his subiects so affected.
The Gréeke Prince leauing them, onely with his sword and the strong priuie Coate that Venus gaue him, he left his Chamber, taking the next way to the Garden, which was the place he thought to meete the Lady at, which indéed was so.
For accompanied with Fausta and Laissa, whom she had made partaker of her Loues, and also how she estéemed the Persian Prince, were both determined to go with them, being assured what great Princes they were, if that meanes might debarre that vniust marriage.
Claridiano comming to the doore, gaue his signall, which Fausta knowing, opened, saying.
In faith sir knight, now sée you cannot but be happie in your owne Loues, being so carefull of anothers.
This is my vnhappinesse, to sée by experience anothers faith well guerdoned, and liue my selfe in the greatest dispaire that euer knight in the world did.
It may be (answered said she) you are onely euil conditioned: for by all your other parts, you deserue the wide worlds admiration.
That is not so much (said the gallant Prince) as my misfortune is great that guides it this way.
Well leaue we this (replied she) and go we where my Lady and the faire Laissa doo expect you: and haue patience, for this is but the touchstone, whereon the Ladie by true proofe makes triall of the Louer.
By this came the two Ladies fairer then Apollo, and Venus stepping foorth, said.
did so greatly feare, dispairing knight, that séeing your selfe at libertie, you would easily forget whom you left in prison, that thought best to get company to séek you abroad, if you ouerlong should tarry, and with my owne hands take my reuenge, which should not be litle rigorous.
Had bene happie diuine Ladies (said the Prince) as to haue knowne this resolution, to féele the pleasure that wounds giuen by those your sacred hands doo yéeld, would not haue so soone returned.
But yet knowing the falling into any forgetfulnesse in you seruice, how litle soeuer, was paine intollerable, inforced me so soone to hasten my comming, to be resolued of your will, the which those Princes nor my selfe wil in nothing contradict.
loue so truly to kéepe my word inuiolate heroicke Prince of Grecia (answered the Ladie) that know not what more to say: sauing this, doo altogither submit my fortunes to your order, which during life wil obserue, assured that such a knight wil respect my poore immaculated honour, the which although in some respect doo repugne, yet to frustrate my intended marriage, wil venture my person in any peril you shal vndergo: therefore in this, there is no more to doo but plot it as you thinke best, for that is our determination.
And since the Gods haue in all things made you so absolute, doo not gréeue if take this Ladie in my company: For shée will in no case remaine any longer in my Fathers Court, whilest absent my selfe.
In charge had that you last spake of (saide the Prince) from my Lord and Vncle the Prince of Dacia: but séeing she is pleased with what we al desired, let vs no longer procrastinate our iourney, making all things readie for the same two daies hence, in which time you may send to our lodging those things you shall bee best pleased to take with you.
Be it as you haue said (soueraigne Prince, said Venus for hauing in our defence the mightie Alphebos sonne, it is nothing wee haue vndertaken, were it farre harder.
Occasion they had to demaund for the Persian, which being not omitted, things passed so plainly, that the Gréeke reioyced to sée his friend so well imployed.
Any ones good would glad him, though hée himselfe did want it.
He tooke his leaue of the Ladies with a thousand imbracements, that had not Archisilora gouerned his soule, and the reason of his thoughts, it were no wonder had he stood a while ponderating the content thereof: but he with one ordinarie courtesie in liew of so many fauours, left them, of themselues iealous with feare of that they should do, although their comfort was, that such Princes had vndertooke their safetie.
They straight beganne to order the preparations for their iourney from Xantho.
While the valourous Gréeke returned to the Princes, that receiued him with excéeding ioy, relating to them all their conference, with the Ladies resolution, which not a little contented them, and moreouer said.
And haue newe commends to the haughtie Bransiniano, Prince of Persia, for the Ladies demaunded for none but him, and am glad in my heart to knowe how matters passe, and in faith had not thought the Dacian Lord to bee so warie.
Valiant Gréeke (said Don Eleno knowe, that in matters of Loue, the greatest concealement is greatest fire, for nothing contents Cupid more, then to sée how by the sole motion of the eyes two agres, concluding more with the sight, then others in an age, in present daily continual discourses.
For nothing better blazoneth the soules newes, then the eyes, and if they so could, no maruell they be agréed, and greater matters can Loue so effect.
So with great content did they all expect the second day, to take the Ladies from the Pallace: for the men they sent for, were by that come to the place appoynted.
The next day Fausta sent thrée or foure of the Ladies chests, and the one and the others, awaited the darknesse of the approaching night, wherin befell them what the next following Chapter doth resite.
How the Princes conueyed the Ladies out of the Pallace.
The battell they had about them with the Kings Knights: and what more happened.
ALreadie had the starrie canabey of heauen darkened the earth with clowdie blacke obscuritie, when the foure mightie valiant warriours clad all in rich and strong abilements of warre, accompanied with the two fierce gyants and twentie knights, (leauing the rest to guard the Ladies Coffers, and to aduertise the armie of their approach) arriued closely at the Garden gate, and making the accustomed signe, Fausta with more courage opened, where they found the Ladies so amazed with feare, that they had no power to vtter one word.
It was no time for ceremonies, so Claridiano taking Venus in his armes, carried her out of the garden, and deliuering her to the Prince of Croatia, said.
Receiue this gift (sir knight) for by doing it, the bonds of my ingaged word.
He could not answer, being ouercloied with ioy, nor yet could she do otherwise.
He returned like the winde for Laissa, (that more courage had then the other) hauing indured many perils, and gaue her to the Prince of Persia, whose gladnesse did excéed the greatest in the world.
He forgot not Palisandro, for almost he plainly conceiued what happened in the Tower, so deliuering Fausta vnto him, spake.
Since thou canst so well dissemble, thou deseruest to haue her in kéeping.
would not (sir knight) that after you haue played your owne parts, you should thus ill rewarde me.
The want of power to care for so many (kinde Fausta hath forced
mee to commit you to his guarding, that knows what torments do possesse me.
faith Prince of Grecia, if you vse to pay all your Squires in this manner, it will make mee rebell against Don Eleno my Lord, for he liuing secure, remembers not vs that be so destitute of fauours.
The not knowing thy minde (friend Lesbio was cause procured not thy remedie, but now knowe thy will, will ere long satisfie thy content.
With many iestes at length they arriued at their armie, where after they rested, the Gréeke would discharge his soule of part of her cares, wedding the beautious Venus to the gallant Pollidolpho, with such content of all the hoste, that feared they not to be heard, had exprest it with applauding shouts.
Here me thinkes (said Eleno all the world flies from farther toyle, which being so, will also do it, by leauing the protection of this soueraigne Ladie, so bestowing her to the Persian, he saide.
To you (sir Knight) must deliuer her, being destitute of strength to guard her.
So well did Venus plead, knowing how the Persian was affected, that foorthwith they were both espowsed, to their admirable ioy.
Content in pleasant chat, were these Princes, and also beeing night, it was not much if they enioyed any secret ioyes, knowe not, but to increase their pleasure, the sencelesse trées were silent.
While they were in their iollitie, no little hurleburley had ouerturned the King and Princes quiet supposed rest of troubles in the Pallace, for going to supper, the Ladies were mist: they entred their chamber, where they found nothing but a letter, whose tenour was.
That Venus was departed, wedded to Pollidolpho Prince of Croatia, a Knight that for merits of person and state, deserued no lesse then Venus: and Laissa vnder the Protect of Bransiniano Prince of Persia, backt and defended by the Prince of Grecia and Tribizound, togither with the valiant Lord of Dacia.
The King was not a little daunted hearing those names, séeing how hard it was for him to bee reuenged, they being such mightie Princes: neuerthelesse hee commanded fortie thousand knights to be presently armed, and being diuided in two squadrons, to follow in fearch of them, for imagining they were alone, thought that méeting them, they would bee easily fetcht backe.
One of the Squadrons the furious Lindauro did lead with the Kings coosin.
The Saracin was pollitique, and so supposing they might bee in the Louers Wood, which made him with swift steppes enter into the same, although the Princes hadde tane some other way.
All that night he lost himselfe, vntill the next morning that hee met with some shéepheards, of whome hee demaunded for them: they gaue him good tokens to haue séene them: telling him also that they were marched towards the sea.
He turned about in all haste with his men in their pursuite, not demaunding whether they had any company or no: but so fast hyed the Princes, that ere they were ouertaken, Phoebus was past the middest of his dyurnall course, and were so neare the sea, that from the Gallies they might beholde them.
The Princes (séeing they were but fewe more in number then they) iudged it cowardize, not to let them know, how they were incenst against them.
knights, to conuey them to their ships, and deuided their battell into two parts.
The ore was commanded by Don Eleno and Bransiniano: and the other, guided the mightie Gréeke, with the new Bridegroome, who was one of the skilfullest in the world, to dispose and order a battell.
In Figure of a halfe Moone, they awaighted their enemies, that séeing them not to be so many as themselues, couragiously prepared to assaile them, hoping the rest would also arriue to them: and with more ease to get the conquest, they approached with the noise of innumerable instruments, and in good order: for the Kings Coozen was a polliticke Knight.
Worthy of séeing was their encountring: for though it was of no puissant hostes, yet so great was the horror, as if one hundred thou+sand men had met.
Foure did dispayring Lindauro ouerthrow before he brake his Launce: for the gréefe to sée his Lady in an others power, did incourage him: he drew forth his sword, and with it, in company of Tarsides (so was the kings coosen named) began to performe wonders, onely they maintaining the heate of the fight.
But that way the foure Heroycke Princes entred, no tongue can expresse their déeds, for they séemed no other then the reapers in the moneth of Iuly among the rypened corne: for their remorcelesse blowes found no resist, that shields, helmes, armor, heads, bodies, and sometimes horses and all were sundred in the middest.
No lesse dammage did the Gyants in their furious passage with their
Admirable was the battle at this time, to heare the pitteous claimours of the wounded, the clashing of armor and weapons, with the resounding noyse of cutting strokes, and the running about the field of horses maisterlesse.
So ill did not the Esclauonians behaue themselues, but they kild being killed, not so much procuring the defence of their owne liues, as their enemies deaths.
Thrée houres endured the fight, without vantage knowne on either side: for the inhabitants would rather die, then suffer their Princesse violently by straungers to be carried away: but in the end of that terme, the Princes being heated in collor, the field had fewe to resist their mortall wounds, for euery blowe was the death of a knight.
By this Pollidolpho and Lindauro met, either by their deuises knew the other.
Glad was the Croatian of the incounter, greatly desiring it, so said.
Now is the time proud Prince, to shewe your déedes in fields, to be otherwise then words in the Pallace.
Without admitting any answere, he did let flie at his Helme, on the outward side, all the Plumes and the crooked top he strooke away, making him shamefully bend in the saddle, and with another stroke laide him sencelesse along his horse.
There he had slaine him, had not Tarsides arriued, staying him with a furious thrust, and giuing Lindauro time to recouer himselfe both at once, not respecting the lawes of knighthood, charged the Croatian.
But the venturous Louer brauely withstood them, giuing and receiuing mightie blowes.
For wanting most of their best Leaders, most pittifull was the bloodie massacre made of them.
Not far off was their remedie, for at the Sunnes declining from the fourth houre, on the top of an hillocke, there appeared the Kings standard, with the other twentie thousand men.
Who seeing the battle in those termes, prickt foorth in all haste, to succor their friends that were vtterly discomfited.
Great hurt did they vppon the Crotians, which also feared some vnluckie hap, so fierce was their assault.
Foure more magnanimious knights then the Princes, were neuer séene: for though their enemies be treble thrée to one, their valour doth supply their want of multitude.
Who waighing the doubtfulnesse of the fight, commaunded the halfe of foure thousand men that kept the Gallies, should stand to ayde their Lords.
For arming themselues, presently they obeyed, taking their way towards the hottest of the fight.
As they went, two knights of admirable disposition, and in rich armes met them, and learning the cause of that conflict, determined to ayde the Ladie.
Good was their helpe, being the two strong Princes, Don Argante of Phenicia, and Thorisiano, that togither wandred to séeke their aduentures.
They entred crying Croatia, when they beganne to driue backe.
But these newe succours was a meane to regaine their lost aduantage, and set their aduersaries hope in daunger.
Sundred were Tarsides and Lindauro, and vnhappily did Tarsides fall into Don Elenos hands, whom he had incensed.
This occasion would not he loose, for with both hands he discharged Brutus sword vpon his shield, it yéelds no defence, for in two it was parted, and with the swords poynt did wound him daungerously on his head.
Hee closed with him, and for Venus sake would not kill him.
But casting his strong armes about him, spurred his Tyrio, and snatcht him from his saddle, that being altogither breathlesse, hée deliuered him to foure knights, to conuey him to the Princesse Venus.
The battell was cruelly renewed, and dead bodies lamentably falling on both sides: but the Princes being inuincible, where ere they went, were assured of the victorie.
Clearly had they obtained it, if Phoebus hastening his Westerne downfall, had not hid his light in Thetis watrie lap, leauing almost half of the Esclauonians dead, with foure thousand Croatians, besides the wounded.
On either side retrait was sounded, for feare of the nights approach.
Pollidelpho being in warre most polliticke, commaunded many fiers to be lighted, that his enemies might thinke they would stay til the morrow: which he nothing lesse minded, iudging it mere follie, because the king had his succors so neare, and they theirs so far off, marcht away to the sea side, causing all manner of lights in the Galleyes to be fired, that the souldiers might imbarke themselues.
They did so, leauing neuer a man on land, except the two Princes, whom another aduenture expected.
The next morrow, the Pagans thinking their enemies had stayed,
scarce had Aurora welcommed Apollo the East, when they began in rankes and files orderly to draw their men in field.
No griefe is comparable to that which the king and Lindauro conceiued, being aduertised by their spies what happened.
So soone as it was knowne they followed towards the shore, thinking to ouertake them: but being thither come, were assured of theyr departure, which made the King Prince most wofully, with bitter laments to exclaime: and more, missing their kinsman Tarsides, they wanted present means to follow them, which forced their returne to Xantho: where they gaue order to prepare all the shipping in the land.
The like did the Sophi, knowing how his son was mocked.
sayles, which was the most famous Fléete that euer came on those seas.
Giants, of the fiercest in the world: with so great and puissant armies, he thought he might make warre vpon the greatest Potentate therof.
Lindauro was appointed Generall by sea and land: that had hée not bene troubled with fantasticke vaine imaginary boastes, he had discharged the office with immortall Fame.
Some time was spent in the preparation and assembling of this mightie army, in which season, the Princes with their sayles spread in the winde, fearelesse of any thing, with their Ladies ioying in their company, within eight dayes landed at Geua, the chiefest hauen in all Croatia.
The inhabitants receiued the Princes with such ioy and costly triumphes, that to shun prolixitie, wée ouerpast day by day, the rumor stil increast of Lindauros co~ming: For which cause, as also for the ladies yt were with child, they intreated the princes to abide with them til they were in peace, or with assurance of agréement with Venus father: who knowing the imprisonment of her Coozen Tarfides, procured his libertie, with such entertainment as his merits deserued.
It did so win him, as also séeing how well beflowed his Coozen was, that he determined to pacifie the proclaimed wars.
Therupon he writ to the king of Esclauonia, alleaging what honor and greater disaduantage he incurred to persecute his daughter, since shee had chosen for her husband, the Prince Pollidolpho, rather then any other.
And if she gaue her promise of marriage to Lindauro, it was onely to please his honor, and not to satisfie her owne will, hauing before made it obedient to an others command.
This letter a thousand times made him so recant his intent, as he was about so often to haue shewn it the Prince, yet he could not so close kéep it, but he discerned it.
dissembling, séemed to take no notice of it, so that for all that, they set their fortunes on the feas, purposing to land in Croatia.
They had done it, and it had béene one of the cruellest warre in the world, if the wise Nabato (considering his Don Eleno was there detained thereby) had not succoured them, by crossing the huge King with stormes and tempests, that the third part of the Fléete was ouerwhelmed in the deuouring waters.
They returned to Esclauonia, where taking counsell, Lindauro knowing that the Soldan of Nyquea, with the greatest part of Asia and Affrica, did assemble themselues togither against Grecia, resolued to ioyne with them, that with so many multitudes, his reuenge might be the more easier.
As it was determined, he put it in execution, and repairing his tempest beaten ships, directed his voyage towards S. Georges promontory, where it was reported all the generall forces met.
Thus far (admired Ladies) procéeded the sole spoyle of the ioyes it procured, that by so many means sought the easie passage for his reuenge, vpon the robbers of his contents: who without remembrance of what hee (poore soule) indured, past the time in sports and reuels, till the season of the Ladies deliuery was come, both who brought forth two Girles, whose beauties being in their prime, darkened Apollos clearest light.
The childre~ were borne with seuerall tokens: for the Persians had on their brests Loues bowe and quiuer of arrowes.
Venus daughter had also in the breast, a hand whiter then the snow, that twixt the fingers held a heart as red as blood.
Much adoo there was to name them, in the end it was remitted to Claridiana, who therein shewed the sharpnesse of his wit, for considering they had got the mothers by force of armes, named the Babylonian Helena: he did not so amisse, because for her sake there were no lesse cruelwars, the~ Troye sustained about the first, as it is in the fourth part of this Historie.
Venus girle was called Pollixena, in remembrance of her whose loue so dearly Gréeke Archilles did abide.
Euery one praised the wittie naming of the Ladies by the Prince, who expressed his ioy and loue in the performance of a famous iouster.
He craued leaue of the Ladies to depart, thinking he wronged his owne, to liue so long in those pleasures, which he obtained with great difficultie.
The day before ye two Princes wold depart, Pollidolpho thus spake.
It is so manifest (most mightie Prince) yt many infinit recou~tlesse fauours and benefits haue at your hands receiued, which soring to so high prized valor, my life is insufficie~t to satisfie ye least degrée
of gratitude: but neuerthelesse that you may knowe the zeale of my thankfull minde, and how account my sole felicitie in your deare amitie, am determined to become a Christian, for all my land will haue it so: by which act do eternally propagate my loue, with such excellent warlike Princes: and therefore will receiue the Baptisme at your hands, togither with my wife and daughter.
The Princes conceiued excéeding ioy with Pollidelphos déed: whereto Don Eleno thus replied.
Wee cannot but credibly beléeue (most noble Prince) so illustrious a déed hath long since béene prophecied, with more diuine inspirations, then humane determination: to corroborate our friendship, there was no cause to intimate this: for to obserue the lawes of honourable true Loue, the least ground with so costly experience, were ynough.
Happie be this amitie, and confirmed with such bounds of faith, wee cannot feare that the alterations of time reuoluing chaunces, may any way preuaile against vs.
knowe not whether may call most happie, you or your subiects, for if they haue Pollidelpho for their Lord, you haue a people that amongst neighbours of most woorth, had got the honour of themselues by so glorious a déed: the which may hee that hath begunne it, blesse, and to eternall posterities so propagate as we desire.
Wherevpon they embraced, as they had but then séen one another, doing the like by the beautious Venus, confirming her daughters name.
And Laissa séeing her husband a Christian, would not longer continue Pagan.
For eight daies during the feastes of those solemnities, the Princes delayed their going, in the end whereof, the Greeke Prince, with onely his Squire Pallisandro, departed from his friends.
His company required the Dacian, but Lesbio his Dwarffe would not: saying it behooued Claridiano to goe alone: where forrowing the waued boosome of Neptunes region, we leaue them a while, to relate what else happened in Constantinople.
The preparations the mightie Emperour Trebatio made, knowing all Asia and Affrica did rise in armes against him.
SO many and so certaine were she newes that euery day were broght of the Nyquean Soldans mightie preparations, and of the aydes helpes hee demanded of his bordering neighbour kings, that although it were not giuen out, gainst whom such hostile assemblies of Pagan Infidelles were pressed, yet would not the carefull Christian Emperour séeme carelesse of his necessarie affaires: but rather commaunded Oristides the newe Thessalian king, with al expedition to vnite, with new supplies to stre~gthen al his scattered troupes, and with them to march away along the nearest of their enemies neighbouring holds, that their diligence might stay their haste.
He obeyed, accompanied with his Sarmatia, and executed his office so well, that in fewe daies he reparted on thrée frontiers, to the number of two thousand men.
And leauing the Empire sure that way, he withdrew himselfe with fortie thousand men towards Nyquea, to sée if the enemie would assault any place on the sudden.
He performed it all with such happie spéede, that his good diligence was to no small effect, for that is it which ouercomes the most labourous toyle.
The Troyans quicke expedition was no meanes to make the Emperour be ydle, but rather to shewe his great care.
For of Macedonians and Greecians, he gathered a well furnisht armie, wherewith he accounted himself secure.
Of ye last, nor of those that séemed remisse in these broils, was Torismundo none, but being aduertised of the affaires, he shipt himselfe towards Spaine, where hee prouided all the gallies of Naples and Sicely, with those of Portugall, whose direction Don Siluerio commaunded them to obey.
On the seas was not a more discréeter knight séene, better to order and reprehend a battell.
With fiue hundreth sayles he began to plough the Western Ocean, which contained the powers of Spaine, France, and Portugall, whereof
sixtie hundred thousand were Spaniards, with whose valor he doubted not to confront the proudest enemie.
The French king with consent of the Prince Clauerindo, sent vnder the Spanish Ensignes
Of all these men, he had made his Lieftenant Generall, his valiant son Corselio.
About the end of Aprill with all these powers, the furious Torismundo found himselfe on ye vtmost confines of his land, in sight of Lauering, where ouerviewing all his Fléete, from the hatches of his Gallie, all in sanguine armor raising his Beuer, and on a bloody Launce, he thus spake.
shall not néed most valiant knights to explicate in words, what great rewards a wel fought battle doth yéeld: nor what neuer dying honor is therby obtained, where rather a man must be fou~d dead, holding his sword within his hand, then for feare to haue it said, he did force it.
But since we wade within such danger of our liues, will no more remember saue the auncient blood from whence we do descend: since it was neuer said of a French man, yt killing he did flie.
will not particularize the déeds of Spaine, where Fame these waste seas can memorise more then what is reported, that her ordinance in millitarie discipline is able to attempt the hardiest enterprise.
The which since wee haue sufficient, conioyned with such strength, let vs imploy it all, for with so mightie forces, it were an easie matter to ruinate the whole world.
The which, that it may be done with more courage, do denou~ce this war with fire and sword, to be executed, yet intreating, that none to shew himselfe valiant, become barbarously cruell: for nothing so much as it doth blemish the deserued reputation of a souldier.
Where ending, the Admirall discharged thrée péeces of ordinance, as a signe that euery one should be ready against the mornings Sun vprise, with outspread sayles, to recommend their Fortunes to the fauours of the windes and waues.
great encouragement to all the men were the Generalles animating words, whereat to expresse how feruently they were addicted to the warres, they all vnsheathed their swords, proclaiming the obedient faith due to their Prince, who with a merrie gale of winde set towards Grecia, aduertising the Emperor of his comming, who was not a little glad of his ayde.
He entered the wide Hauen of Constaninople, discharging all his grose Artillerie, with such noise, that heauen and
earth séemed to méet, al the Castles answered them with the like.
There was none but came to the shore, to see the entrance of the Spanish Fléet.
No lesse gallant on land then a good souldier on Sea, would hee shewe himselfe, landing all the Spaniards in good order, brauely attired, and euery one with a gréene scarfe a crosse his breast, to distinguish them from the Frenchmen, that wore theirs read, and the Portugals russet.
thousand Portugals, and fiftie thousand French, leauing the rest to guard and defend his Gallies.
It excéedingly gladded the Emperor to sée so well furnished men, and chiefly with father and sonne, whom hauing neuer before séene, in his very soule he reioyced to sée their excellent disposition.
By land was alreadie arriued his deare Grisanda, whose companie was most welcome to the Gréeke Ladies.
The immeasurable ioy cannot be expressed, which the Spaniards co~ceiued séeing the Dames of Greece, and as in warre no amorous thoughts were euer troublesome to a souldier, so the dread command of angrie Mars, could not hinder them from the procurement of some swéet sure rest, in whose name they might imploy the valor of their persons.
This pleasing life did little last, for the Emperour hauing true notice that his friends were comming to succor him, resolued to go séek his enemies, know gainst who~ such inumerable powers were asse~bled.
On the other side, the absence of his deare sonnes much troubled him, for he had onely with him his sonne Rosuler, that at Oliuas intreaties did stay.
Also the furious Brandafidel was with him, on whose strength he reposed much hope.
The Gréeke Alphebo had no néed of aduertisement, for the generallitie of the warres was come vnto his eares, and so with the greatest power he could vnite, withdrew himselfe to Tribizound, accompanied with Braminoro and Tefereo: who most gréeued at the Princes absence, was the beautious Archisilora, attributing the lacke of Claridianos presence to her owne strangenesse: her sorrow was easily discerned by her outward semblance.
No lesse was Rosamondes to sée her so: knowing the cause, it so tormented her, that for feare it should be perceiued, she resolued to absent her selfe, for commanding the Gouernors of her kingdome, should with all conuenient spéede, conduct the greatest power of well prouided men they could select of her Kingdome to Constantinople, and there to rest vnder the Emperours gouernment.
They accomplisht their Quéens beheft (for then she, no Princesse was more with loue respected of subiects) sending when time serued, fiftie thousand of well armed men.
The day before her departure, shee tooke her leaue of Rosamond with no fewe teares, for neuer betwéene two Ladies was such simpathie of true amitie.
Very importunately she offered her co~pany, but as any good societie wold but aggrauate the Quéenes euill, shee would not admit it: saying shee might not leaue Greece and the Emperour in such necessitie.
Then her armes (being the best the world contained) she presented her.
Them shee also refused, for Lirgandeo had prouided her with such as were requisit for safegard of her person: which were of the same colour as Claridianos, sauing that the sable barres were filled with flames of fire: on her shield was a gallant deuise, for out of a field full of odoriferous flowers, a Ladie séemed to go in search of a knight, after whom she in great haste ascended vp a craggie rocke, from whence she looked after the content she lost: and the Motto betwéene them, thus.
Little hope of ioyes abide, That leaue knowne ioyes, for ioyes vntride.
Alone would the warlike warriour néeds go, thinking her gréefe a sufficient company: all the Court sorrowed for her absence: but Lirgandeo assuring them of her safetie, their discontent was lessened, mounted on a lustie Courser, shee crost the woods of Greecia, thinking on her Lord, calling her selfe a thousand times most cruell, for that in being so, shee had lost him: and by the losse, obtained so great torments.
Shee shipt her selfe in a barke bound for Alexandria, resolute to trauell the whole world, in pennance of her folly.
One night among the rest, while the warriours slept, she walked (as she vsed) on the hatches, with her lame~ts, to make the watrie dwellers partakers of her gréefes: at such time that another barke sayled by hers, from whence might be heard some entermingled grones with sighes.
She could not knowe what it was, so swift it went away.
After it with all possible spéede, with ores and sayles, she commaunded hers should followe: it was done with such diligence, till shee ouertooke the barke, wherein shee sawe a Knight complaine of Loue and Fortune thus.
Ay me vnfortunate Prince (said the knight) is it possible there should be no euill, but the extreamest sower it containes, my perplexed soule shuld féele? Why should hope for any good, when with mine eyes sée it flie from me? There is no inconuenience but haunts me, except death, with whom cannot be acquainted.
Oh Gréekish Prince, how happily mayest thou call thy selfe happie, by being in thy infancie brought vp with the soueraigne of my life, and hearts direction, since that was an occasion for the obtaining of those rights solely due to to me.
Oh Liriano, (thy name being sufficient to asswage the gréefe that me torments) who might by sacrificing my life into thy hands, assure thée in faith thy Louer deserue not comparison with me.
To you, to you, do complaine: Oh you pray, that séeing her celestiall habitation is in your vaste confused watrie kingdome, a little intreate her for the vnhappie Bembo.
Oh Loue, how rigorously hast thou in all things shewen thy crueltie against me? Wherein haue offended thée? when disobeyd thy commands? when violated thy lawes? abolished thy rights? or when did my painfull thoughts harbor or conceiue the least imagination against thy honour or deitie? If this be so, and not vnknown to thée, why doest thou wound him with tyrannie, that is orborne with weaknesse, and thy disastrous chaunces? Oh how many any (pardon me faire Ladies) be hereafter confident on your perfections, your crueltie being as great as your beauties are incomparable, if you reward him that can loue, like him that onely liues to hate? No more could the Ladie heare, for the barke was guided by Lupertio, but what she heard was ynough to increase her paine, and raise some doubt, that the named Prince was he whom she loued.
Oh generall plague (said the gréeued Lady) none canst thou forgiue, shewing thy care in most tormenting them, that are most carelesse of thée.
shower of infinit teares rained the Quéene downe her pearled théekes, procéeding from the extremitie of loue: hauing so done, séeing her selfe comfortlesse, and not knowing whom to aske for, hauing no notice of the Gréekes deuise, she began to giue vent vnto her swelling thoughts, singing these verses.
My heart will burst except it be discharg'd, Of his huge load, that doth oppresse it so: Streames stopt, oreflow the bankes, if not enlarg'd, And fire supprest, doth much more fiercer grow.
Great woes ript vp, but halfe the woe remaines: But paines concealde, doth aggrauate the paines.
Sing then my soule the storie of my losse, Forme in sweete words the anguish of my minde: Yet doo not: singing ill becomes a crosse, Rather sigh out, how hard Loues yoke finde.
Loue is a sicknesse, singing a ioy: And pleasure is no pack horse for annoy.
And must then, knowing Loue a disease, That fils our soules with strang calamities: Spite of my heart enforc'd my selfe to please, And in mine owne armes hug my miseries? And seeing still my state waxe worse and worse, Must of force embrace and kisse my curse.
must, must, Cupid hath sworne must, And t'is in vaine and bootlesse to resist: Then be not (Loue) oh be not too vniust, yeeld me to thy rule, rule how thou list.
For my reclaim'd rebellion shall bring foorth, treble dutie to thy glorious woorth.
Oh Loue, sweete Loue, oh high and heauenly Loue, The Court of pleasure, Paradice of rest: Without whose circuit all things bitter prooue, Within whose centure euery wretch is blest.
Oh graunt me pardon sacred deitie, do recant my former heresie.
And thou the gearest Idoll of my thought, Whom loue did, and do, and alwaies will: Oh pardon what my coy disdaine hath wrought, My coy disdaine, the author of this ill.
And for the pride that haue shew'd before: (By Loue sweare) Ile loue thee ten times more.
Hath my proude rigor hunted thee astray? Ile loose my life, or bring thee backe agen.
Each sigh Ile quittance with a thousand grones, And each complaint with a whole age of mones.
And when finde thee, as finde the will, Or loose my selfe in seeking what loue: Then will trie with all true humble skill, Thy pittie on my great offence to moue.
Till when, my griefes are more then tongue can tel, My daies are nights, and euerie place is hell.
With a heauie sigh shee ended: but as if singing had but in part discharged her sorrowes, she beganne with saying to prosecute them as followeth.
Ay me! Quéen of Lyra, (said the Ladie) that hauing no cause to complaine, do suffer thus deseruedly, a iust pay for such deserts.
Of whom else might hope to bee loued, beeing by the Gréeke Prince adored? On the earth, of whom couldst thou expect any good, if not from thy Gréeke? Oh woe is me, that the trust of my small consideration should bring me to this passe, that must make the winds witnesse of my paines: and that to my vnblemisht honours cost, must hue and wander by sea and land, demaunding for him Archysiloras loue: when mought haue liued with ioy, with pleasure, and in quiet, by giuing him a little signe of that happinesse, my selfe receiued by being his: but séeing it is thus brought about, loue will, and patiently embrace this iust imposed toyle.
Here was her languishment renewed, séeing a knight come directly towards her shippe, lying a long the hatches of another, exclaiming against Cupids ordinances.
Who euer suffered (said he) his heart to followe and séeke his owne dishonour? What lawe allowes the soule to disclose that, whose secrecie preserueth no lesse then life? Accidents be these onely incident in loue, for he as the King of extreames enforceth me, not regarding my fame, to procure anothers consent.
Oh (most valiant Knight) who shall beléeue thou shouldest with mee violate thy word?
Thou knowst loue thée, also ye follow thée, but know to aggrauate my
woe, thou fliest my presence? What is become of those swéete words at our parting thou spakest? where is the faith wherwithon my hands thou vowedst loyaltie, protesting, if any pleasure thou shouldest haue, it would procéede only from thinking thou art mine? Thou doest ill guerdon the bountie wherewith laide open vnto thée the secrets of my soule, making my selfe tributary vnknowne to whome.
did it when thou iudgedst it newe life, newe ioy, newe ease, and newe content: But now altogither forgetfull, thou fliest from me, that liue to loue thée.
So ouerwhelmed in her owne thoughts was the bewteous Floralizar, who departing from the furious Brauorant, followed the searche of the Tinacrian, whom shée so intierly affected, that shée regarded not whether any heard her.
By the complaints did Archisilora knowe her to be a Ladie, and pittying her, caused her Barke to be grappled with the other, and saide.
No maruell (heroicke Ladie) that since the lande hath alreadie beene acquainted with your constancie, you nowe participate your faith vnto these inhospitable waters.
Be of good courage, for you haue company in your woes: and such as wil neglect his owne to remedie yours.
Who are you (Syr Knight) that so kindly doo commiserate my paine, which is the greatest that euer was inclosed in any humane breast? am hée, (saide Archisilora who with my soule (valiant Ladie) will procure your quiet: and therefore pray you, accept such seruice as my Barke wil yéeld: for it may be, the recitall of your griefs to me, and mine to you, wil be a mittigation of some sorrow.
Ile not forgo the enioying of so good company as that you offer mee (Syr knight) said Floraliza, intreating may know who you be that alreadie knowes my gréefs? The Ladies gallant behauior had attracted the Lirian Matrons affection, who replied.
In more then this doo desire to satisfie you soueraigne Ladie, but first step into my ship, where wil do it at full.
To know your name (answered Floraliza a harder enterprise would attempt.
Aduantage hath my Barke got (sir knight) with my absence, to which being alone, the winds and waters may now be more fauourable, then when was in it, and since we haue this opportunitie, deare sir, defer not my desire.
her Helme, resting more faire then was Latonas sonne, when onely for loue he kept Admetus shéepe.
Floralizas was also of, whose beautie was equalled by fewe, and that want was with valour supplied.
Let it not gréeue you Soueraigne Lady said the Quéene, that knowe she cause of your mones, for mine are no lesse: which suffer séeking for him, that ought to dye louing, but since am the cause therof, it is reason endure the extremitie of gréefe: and séeing loue hath equalled vs therein, Ile no longer kéepe from you who am.
So she related vnto her euerie thing she could, not naming Claridiano.
Why now (said Alicandros Néece) do account my paine a pleasure, being pittied by you, and haue assured hope we shall quickly finde redresse: wherto the Quéene answered.
Gladly would know who he is to labor your content.
Any certaine thing know not (replyed she) more then that am an others: for a brother of mine called Celindo, and my selfe, were brought vp without knowledge of father, though since we receiued the order of armes, we haue met with certaine tokens to be children vnto the prince Meridian.
Excéeding ioy conceiued the Quéen, of the Ladies company, resoluing to enioy it so long as she would.
They vowed firme amitie, which towards the peace was of no small effect: for this Lady was of highest estimation among the Pagans, in the Grecian warres.
By little and little being tender of yeares, and knowing that the manifesting of their loues, was some ease to their borthering cares, either vnderstood who was the Louer to the other.
So that our fortune doth permit (most Péerelesse Princesse) the Gréeke Princes to tryumph ouer our hearts.
Séeing the heauens will haue it so (excellent Lady aunswered the Quéene) and so haue fauoured them from their birthes, we cannot but acknowledge their Soueraigntie, specially the Tynacrian Prince, knowing how great his gaines are, thus being loued.
Stay my good Quéene: how well (by knowing your selfe to be loued) doo you iudge a straungers distresse? who would not liue contented in middest of the greatest euill, were wée certaine of that assurance? What paine would not then be a pleasure? or what could make mee a stranger to my selfe, onely séeking the company of my woes? But
feare illustrious Ladie, that as the heauens haue made them absolute happie, so some one of them wil place his felicitie in scorning her shall most intierly loue him: And if any there be that wil most truly verifie my doubt, it wil be the sonne of that most cruel Garrofilea: For what could procéed from so cruel a mother, but so cruel a sonne, to reiect the constantest faith that any age ere knew.
Let it not so gréeue you bewteous Floraliza (said the Quéene) that the knight of the Braunch doo wander in absence of your presence, so we distrust not of his loue: And you doo not well to condemne him of ingratitude: for ile pawne my word vnto you, vowing by my high thoughts, to procure with all my power your chéefest ioy: for it were iniustice, another should call him hers, you being alone in the world that deserue him.
This liberall promise was some comfort to Floraliza, as thinking that in her company she should not méete with any inconuenience, although she perswaded her selfe she should not hope euer to be by him beloued.
In pleasant discourses of Loue and Armes, they past away, their else ouer tedious voyage, vntil the fiftéene day of their Nauigation, that they arriued at the fruitful land of Tinacria, where what aduentures there befel them, another Chapter shall relate.
The aduentures that happened vnto the two Ladies in Tynacria, with certaine Gyants that had by stealth imprisoned the Queene Garrofilia, and her bewteous daughter Rosaluyra.
GLad in their glittering rich abillements of warre, landed the two warrelike Ladies, bringing on shoare the Quéenes Horse: which she offered to Floraliza, that would not take it, but would goe a foote, which made Archifilora doo the like, with maiesticke pace leading her Courser by the bridle.
Along a broade and beaten pathe trauelled both these Princes of bewtie, and Bellonas in valour.
They had not gone scarce a mile, when they espied thrée knights of gallant disposition: and well mounted, comming the same way: a crosse
the same lane issued an other: then whom the Ladies had not séene many of more liberal and brauer carriage: his deuice and armes were discribed at the Tryumphes in Constantinople, for this was Don Clarisel of Assyria, Floralizas great Louer.
Well did the Lady know him, and although the faith he shewed her, could no whit withdraw her affection from the Tynacrian: Neuerthelesse, it pleased her to giue him that content that Ladies vse to yéeld in pleasant chat, reseruing the best for their soules beloued.
She tolde the Quéene, how shee knewe that Knight, but it behooued her to bee then concealed, for that she told her.
At length they all met, and none of them but incessantly gazed on both the Ladies.
None of the thrée Knights were so courteous as the Assyrian Prince, and so the one said.
It were some case (Sir knights) for one to ride while the other went on foot, and so by turnes to vse your horse.
Because we will not trouble our selues (answered Floraliza to mount and dismount so often, we haue chosen thus to trauell togither, vntill by some good chance we get an other horse.
This countrey doth yéeld so fewe (said he) Sir knight, that feare it will be very hard to get one.
Notwithsta~ding, had rather haue my hopes (replied the lady) the~ thy vnciuill answere: whereto the knight said.
What, comming on foot and with such little shew of valour, dare you make comparatiues with my words? which were you better mounted then am, would not suffer, especially comming as you doo.
There is no fault (said the Lady) but may bee found in a discourteous knight, and therefore, hauing committed this, there is no doubt but you haue all the rest: yet if you will try your much strength with mine, am content to doo it: conditionally, that he which shall forgoe his saddle, loose his horse and armour.
Had you a horse (said the knight) would not much care to doo it, were it but to disburthen you of your armed loade: which now in hotte weather will be surely troublesome.
Let not that gréeue you (said shee) for my companion will lend me his horse, and be content to loose him, if you ouerthrowe me.
Eare he could answere, with such grace she leapt into the saddle, that the Quéen and Prince were amazed, and brandishing her Lance, she went towards the knight, saying.
Go too, discourteous knight, now is the time to trie whether of the two can better kéepe his armor.
Forced through the challenge hée had made, and the presence of his companions, he turned about his great horse, which was the last he did in all his life.
For meeting, although the Ladie receiued a strong incounter, hers was such, that making three parts of the lance appeare at his backe, at one instant, he lost horse, armour, and life.
No longer stayed the other two, séeing their friend slaine, but ranne against the Ladie, no more stirring her, then if they had run against a rocke.
The Quéen was abashed, seeing how basely the Knights behaued themselues, so drawing foorth her good sword, at two steps shee was where Floraliza stood, with Camillas in her hand.
The Quéen entred sidelong with her sword aloft, which valiantly discharging on the Knights helm, she strooke him from his horse, and with another, on the ground ended his life: which done, quickly mounted his horse, confounding the Assyrian with admiration, who turning about, sawe the Ladie beate the other Knight vnto the earth, with a most pitteous wound: whose paine, ere it left him, left him lifelesse.
In faith (sir Knight) wee haue now horses for Pages, had we brought any, if they were on foote, wanting armour, here we want no choise.
greater punishment then this (said Floraliza deserued their discourtesie: and turning to the Assyrian, thus spake.
Haue you any néed (sir Knight) of our helpes, for since we haue got horses, a little haste else calles vs away.
By the voyce he séemed to know her, whose figure he had impressed in his heart, and so in some amazement did replie.
Not at this time (sir Knight) more then comming in time, that might enioy the sight of your high déed, would not loose the conceiued content of gazing on them, especially being atchiued by whom deserues the honour of euery victorie.
So fearing the Prince had knowne, or that by longer conuersation she might be discouered, she tooke leaue of him, and with the Quéene entred into a thicket adioyning, to rest, not of the battell toyle, but of the seas wearinesse.
They allighted, letting their horses féed on the grasse, where shee recounted who Don Clarisell was, and how sincerely he published himselfe to bee her Louer, and how vnknowne to either, they were brought vp in one wood.
She did recite the aduentures with such passion, that the Quéene verily
In many diuers matters did the two Ladies chat away the afternoone, leauing vntil the next day their approach vnto the great and famous Citie of Tynacria, where so many aduentures happened vnto the mightie Emperour Trebatio.
It greatly pleased Floraliza to tread on the soyle of her deare knight, hartily beséeching the immortal Gods, to graunt her no other end of her desires then her faith deserued, wherwith she sought him: for she neuer imagined any thing, but what increased loue, to loue him, and with vnfained constancy harbouring his affaires in the midst or her heart, transferring them from thence vnto the soule, to giue them there a place more quiet, frée from the worlds perturbations, and fortunes assaulting stormes: and where she might better contemplate her happinesse, being the Tynacrians Maisters.
They scruple of that litle they had from the Barke brought, with more content in being there pursuing their Louers, then were they in Constantinople, féeding on the daintiest cates of the Emperors Court.
Hauing done, they a while discoursed of their knights, thinking that time lost wherein they did not remember them.
The houre of rest being come, the tender Ladies made their blanckets of their beds, the earth, and for pillowes tooke their Helmes, and not without some teares to sée themselues in that manner, and vncertaine whether their toyle would auaile them.
She that slept least, not for louing most, but fearing her affections zeale would not bee accepted, was the Emperour Alicandros Néece, that about midnight vnclasping the booke of her secret thoughts, she found it so full of amorous arguments, grounded on deare experience, that it caused in her a newe griefe: which tormenting her with some extraordinary passion, to giue it passage she sat her vnder a loftie Pyne, where supposing the Quéene of Lyra was not awake, she began with more melodious harmony (then his, that descended into the vawtes of hell, among those blacke inhabitants, to fetch his deare wife) to sing these verses.
Once thought, but falsly thought Cupid all delight had brought, And that Loue had been a treasure, And a Pallace full of pleasure, Bur alas! too soone proue, Nothing is so sower as Loue.
That for sorrow my Muse sings: Loue's a Bee, and Bees haue stings.
When thought had obtained That deare sollace, which if gained Should haue caus'd all Ioy to spring, (View'd) found it no such thing: But in steed of sweete desires, Found a Rose hem'd in with Bryers.
That for sorrow my Muse sings: Loue's a Bee, and Bees haue stings.
Wonted pleasant life adew, Loue hath chaung'd thee for a new: New indeed, and sowre proue it, Yet cannot chuse but loue it.
And as if it were delight, pursue it day and night.
That with sorrow my Muse sings: loue Bees, though Bees haue stings.
The swéete melodie awaked the faire Archisilora, ioying to sée her so firme a Louer.
Long did they not continue thus, by reason that from the farthest side of the thicket, they heard the trampling of many horses, and now then, the cries of outraged Ladies, by violence opprest.
little thing was inough to moue them, being naturally bold, togither they rose bridled their horses, and swifter then the wind they spurd after the noyse.
In such haste went they, that though they quickly got into the high way, yet could they not know the cause.
They durst not sunder themselues for feare of loosing, but rather referring their affaires to Fortunes dispose, they followed along that way which was most beaten with horses hoofes: Two myles they gallopt not finding what they desired, til with ye mornings suns vprise, in a large faire plain they descried some
Assured to haue found what they sought, they let goe their Coursers reignes, with more fiercenesse then Mars himself.
Neuer was such boldnes séen, for the knights were mightie, and for ye enterprise chosen, and ye Giants euery one an Hercules.
Neuertheles, the royall Ladies nothing doubting the fearful assault, with their swords in hand, entred among those knights, as the hungry Lyon enters a heard of harmelesse shéep, to séek his praie.
Against the Ladies strength, their aduersaries stéele doubled shéelds nor fine tempored armor was no defence: for their valor and puissance was infinit, and the desire they had to frée the prisoners, made them with more force floorish their swords among them.
Ere they were aware, eight of their fellowes were slaine, and the rest strooke the Ladies with many encounters: but their Armor was such, as they suffered no impression.
So the furie of their Launces being past, Oh Archysilora, who would not admire thée, séeing thée raised on thy styrrops, the shéelde at thy backe, and with thy sword betwixt both thy hands, range among those knights, giuing no blowe, but was deadly, or deadly wou~ding? At her héeles followed the Sythian Matrone, that no lesse then she made her selfe feared with Camillas blade, whose edge euen to the bone pierced their armor.
It séemed they both striued to excéed the other in déeds, almost impossible in humane sight.
Abashed were the Gyants togither with a bigge Knight that was Lord of them all, to sée how two knights hazarded their pryze, with so much labour obtained: to be rid of them two Gyants, with croes of Iron made towards them, crying to their knights: Away, away, you cowards, for shame blush to sée two Knights thus vsed.
Neuer were they by them obeyed more willingly then then: for with the word they withheld their swords, accounting that co~mand their liues, which fighting with the two, they aduentured on the dyce.
The two mightie Gyants on their styrrops stretcht themselues, and shaking their armes, threw the croes more fiercer then were they hurried from a Cannons mouth.
Carfully did the two Ladies (séeing how it concerned them) expectit, that spurring their horses, gaue way vnto the Iauelings, and ioyning so neare their Maisters, that ere they drew their Comitors, they made them féele the waight of their armes.
So eager was Meridians daughters assault, that she lost the strength of her blowe, yet was it such, that falling on his Beuer it dazelled his sight, and wounded him at large on the fronte, from whence the bloud issuing, and dropping in his eyes, blinded him, to the Ladies great aduantage.
Forward she past, swifter then lightning, and with the same she turned: at such time that the Gyant did so, as furious as a bayted Bull, with his Fawchon raysed against her, that he wounded him, and at once on either discharged the furie of their weapons.
thousand starres saw the Lady within her rich helme, but the Giants was filled with blood, for the thin edged sword on the head, wou~ded him dangerously.
This while was not the Quéene idle, for in her assault she had brauely done he part: and being longer winded, and more vsed to the warre then Floraliza, with Mars his strength, she laid him on the side of his helme, disarming all that part, and on the head gaue him a mightie wound, cutting away a péece of the skull, and the blade discending downe the shoulder, with like furie, as the roaring waters runne through a lockt riuer, it strooke away all his Vanbrace, and with it cut all the laces off his shield, and made him shake like a loftie Pyne: strooke with an other blast, she gaue her horse the reignes, and quickly turned him before the Gyant, setled himselfe, shee let flie at his wounded arme.
This blowe assured her the victorie, for lighting on the vnarmed place, she threw it to the ground, and made him roare horribly: for the wound was mortall.
Without payment scaped not the Quéene, for ere his soule departed, dispairing of life, so mightie a blowe hee discharhed on her head, that she fell vpon her horse, voyding much blood from her mouth: with such strength was it executed, that finding no other stay, it drew the Gyant after it, who like a Tower ouerturned with a whirle winde, he fell downe.
Long in accompanying him was not the other, for Floraliza enuying what the Quéene had done, so vehemently pursued her Combat, that she tumbled the Gyant at her horses féete, with so many deadly wounds, that he straight gaue his soule vnto the diuell, that long since had expected it.
No longer stay made the other Gyant and knight, but with their Coursers fastest running, prickt against the Ladies, to surprise them vnawares.
Dangerous were not the encounters, by reason of their enchaunted armor, though they were extreame greeuous.
Betwéene the foure, they began one of the brauest battels on the earth.
But at the instant it was disordered: for the knights not respecting their honors, altogither stept to aide their maisters: in no little danger were the ladies, séeing themselues assaulted so many waies: but fetching strength and courage from their amorous breasts, they inacted déeds impossible to Mars his sight.
He that most vext them was the great Knight, being one of the stoutest in all Paganisme.
With him the faire Quéene made her battell, thinking by that meanes the victorie was surest.
Shee left the beautious Floraliza with the Gyant, and some twentie Knights that were left, but so wounded, that she quickly brought them to twelue.
They were all busied in those bloodie affaires, when the braue Assyrian like a thunderbolte galloped along that field towards them: who also had heard the Ladies outcries in the Chariot, and hasting to helpe them, had lost himselfe in the wood, notwithstanding he came in good time, amazed to sée so many dead.
He knew the Knights, and they him: he entred with his lance aboue hand: a better blowe was not executed in that battell, for approaching the place where his Ladle fought, strongly brandishing, he threwe it at the Gyant, which penetrating all his stéeles places, it appeared at his backe, the pike bloodie with his hearts gore.
This blowe was to no small purpose, for it mooued a suddain strange alteration in the Ladies breast, iudging so well of him that gaue it, that ouer ioyed with that content, she said to her selfe.
Oh most heroicke Knight, would might satisfie thy desires, and not wrong the Tynacririan.
There stayed not the galliant Don Clarisell, for drawing foorth Mylos furious sword, he gaue no blowe, but ouerthrew an enemie dead: close by them went the Ladie, excéeding glad to sée him.
On horsebacke was the Prince, one of the greatest Knights in the world, and so richly armed, no heart could desire more.
For all this, ceased not the warlike Lirian Matrone to pursue the great Knight, entring, and retiring with such agillitie, as Mars himselfe, were hee there, could wish no more.
In his countrie was the Pagan accounted the valiantest knowne, wherefore he brauely held out in fight.
Of all helpes néeded he, combatting with the Quéene, both in beautie, and in valour, who florishing her weapon, stept in with one foote forward, and lay open, that the Pagan might enter: who being excéeding skilfull, perceiued her intent, and making her loose two blowes, gaue her two thrusts one after another, which forced her to bow backwards on her horse: as she raised her selfe, with all possible spéede hee strooke her on her rich helme, but reacht her onely with the poynt, wherefore the blowe was not to much purpose, though it gréeued her much.
No Hircanian Tyger was now comparable to the Quéene in fury, to sée her selfe so vsed, she florished her sword, and let it fall so mightily on his head, that it felde him along the saddle, sorely wounded.
She trusted to the strength of her Horse, so giuing him the spurres, ranne against her enemy, incountring him so strongly with his breast, that shée ouerthrew them both to the ground.
But the Pagan knowing his disgrace, leapt aside, and though weake and with many wounds, setled himselfe to make his defence against the Quéene, that nimbler then an Eagle, leapt from her horse after her pray.
Deadly wounded was the Pagan, and no maruell then, if with euery blowe she make him kisse the earth with his handes and knées.
Alreadie were the Louers (though different in affection) rid of all their enemies, and were set to gaze on the battell, when from the top of the mountaine descended a Knight with more brauery then the sun.
Farefull it was to heare the trampling noyse of his neighing Courser, wheresoeuer he trod.
He arriued at the chaire, extreamly abashed to sée all his hast had not auailde him.
Oh cowardly Prince (said hée) is it possible thou hast shewen thy selfe slow in thy Ladies seruice? thou doest wro~gfully call thy selfe hers, being the least in ayding her in her greatest distresse.
There was hee interrupted, hearing a horrible blowe: which was thus, The Quéen noting they all looked on her, iudged it weaknesse longer to continue, and therefore strongly stretching her selfe on her left foote, with both hands laid on the Pagans broken helme such a blow, that diuiding his head downe to the neck, at one instant she ended both his loues and life.
And as if she had done nothing, mounted into her seate, and turned about to thanke the Assyrian for his good helpe: whereto he answered.
All, and more then this is due to your valour, (most excellent Knight) for where yours and this Knights is, little auailes mine.
So thence they went to speak vnto the Ladies in the Chariot, which were Garrofilea, and her bewtious daughter Rosaluyra, with two other damzels their attendants, whose beautie made our two Ladies somwhat enuie them.
Neuer did any Knight affect with more reason, Lindoriano Prince of Nyquea, who was new come.
Well did mother and daughter knowe him, and none like him had the Princesse estéemed.
From the heauens may you receiue your deserued recompence (most mightie knights) for the
succour you lent me and my daughter (said the cruell Garrofilea: although considering the dutie by your selues due to the valour of your owne persons, in discharging it, so the immortall powers long since guerdoned it, by imparting so largely their matchlesse gifts with you, making you absolute in all compleate vertues: yet that our ioy may be repleat, and we know to whom we rest bound, we shall account it an exceeding fauor, and remaine debtors togither with the former for the same, if you will relate your names and states vnto vs.
In more then this (soueraigne Quéen) doth this Knight and my selfe desire to fulfill your will.
This Knight, poynting at Floraliza, is called the Knight of Hope: and my selfe, of the burning flames of Loue: we came togither, and therefore know wee not him, to whom we are all so much indebted.
Yet more then this must you do at our intreaties, (said the beautious Rosaluira and for my sake vnlace your helmes, vnlesse you will cancell the bonds of my indebted loue.
There is none but trembles at that word (diuine Ladie) and feares it will bee so (aunswered the Qeéene) and therefore for so much as it toucheth me, wil loose no fauor may therby reap.
Who shall dare do otherwise (said Floraliza excéeding ioyfull thereat, thinking she spake with her Tynacrian.
At once they put off their helms, and being somewhat heated by the battell, there is no beautie comparable to the two Ladies.
Oh Prince of Assyria, oh thou hast a heart of stéele to resist this blowe! Many daies it was since hee sawe her, yet presently he acknowledged her to bee the soueraigne of his soule.
Haue patience magnanimous Louer, for gainst loues accidents there is no better shield.
So like was the Qu. of Lyra vnto the Prince Polliphebo, that Garrofileo assuredly thought shee had her sonne before her, she leapt out of the Chariot with an extazie of ioy, and embracing the Quéene, said.
Oh my deare son Polliphebo, may it bee thou shouldest thus long be absent, and not aduertise me of thy aduentures and happie successes, crueltie more then inhumane it hath béen, and were you not son to such a father, could not beléeue it of any, but knowing whose you be, am assured of your naturall crueltie, which makes mee resemble your tyrannous father.
The Quéen did straight perceiue Garrosileas deceit, and by her words confirmed the report blazoned of her rigors, she told her of it, who she was, which not a little admired the beholders, and also when they knew her companion to be a Ladie, a newe the Quéen imbraced them, saying.
Pardon (soueraigne Ladie) my bolde intreatie, for iudging you to bée the Prince Polliphebo my sonne, hath made me commit this fault.
There hath béene none, vnlesse intended (mightie Quéene) replied Archisilora, but rather it is a fauour exéeding mercie, which thereby receiued.
By this the faithfull Earle of Modica was arriued with aboue thrée hundreth Knights, and the Ladies vnwilling to be stayed, craued leaue to depart.
You will not am sure so wrong vs (saide the Queene) as to leaue vs absent of your company.
We can do no otherwise (imperious Dame) said Floraliza, for the good successe of the aduenture this Lady and haue in hand, consisteth in briefe expedition.
If it be so (heroicke Ladies) and least you should loose that happie successe, am content to loose the great content should reape by your conuersation: wherevppon they kindly embraced and departed, leauing in Tynacria eternal memorie of their beautie and brauery.
And whilest Lindariano made his excuse, crauing pardon for his stay: the beauteous Floraliza thus spake vnto Don Clarisell.
Pardon mée (sir Knight) for not doing this before, but let our lawfull and vnauoyded businesse bee our sufficient excuse, although it néeds not be giuen to him, that may be assured all happie content is wisht him.
Words were these that gaue new life vnto the Louer, nourishing it many yeares with these words.
You haue done mee mightie wrong (most sacred Lady) to intreat him with these wordes, that onely desires to liue perpetually at your obedience.
The Lady drewe away her hands, not suffering him to kisse them, but casting her armes about his neck, said.
He that hath shewed his to be so worthie (heroicke Knight) is iniuried to haue mine, but his rather are to be requested for that sacrifice.
And inquiring for Forsiana and Don Argante of Phenicia (for they all loued one another like brothers) she tooke her leaue of him, refusing his companle, which with his soule he offered, alleadging how it behooued them to go alone.
And as one that with admiration gazeth on the splendor of the heauenly Sunne, with his radiant beames illuminating the earth, and on a suddaine sées it dasht with mystie vapors of a blacke clowde, wherewith his light being obscured, blinds and bereaues the poore beholders of his contented sight.
Euen so thought the Princely Louer he was left, though glad to sée how gently his gentle Lady intreated him.
Towardes the sea did the Ladies take their iourney, where they found two Barkes without any to guide them.
It was admirable, for so soone as the Quéene entred in the one to helpe the Lady in, so swift flies not the arrow loosed from a stéele bow, as of it selfe it lancht into the déepe.
In a minute it vanisht out of sight, leauing faire Floraliza so extreame sorrie, that she was about to fling her selfe into the sea, considering what she had lost.
What content canst thou hereafter hope for poore Ladie (said the afflicted Dame) being robbed of that good the heauens had imparted thée with her companie? What mayest thou account happie, hauing lost her swéete comfortable conuersation? Oh fortune, wouldst thou but waigh how little strength haue left mee by thy inconstant changes, thou wouldst among so many infortunate happes, mingle one fained pleasure.
She shipt her horse in the other barke, and waighing the anchors that held it to the shore, lying along vpon the hatches of the same, shée committed his gouernment to Neptunes mercie.
Yet it was not so ill looked too, but the enuious Lupercio had taken charge of it, who by all possible meanes assembled all the mightiest knights in the Hauen of Nyquea, to transport them thence vnto the maruellous Tower: for he had alreadie knowne, there should bee a knight would win Theseus armor, and his wherewith the inchauntment should be ended: and knowing he was an enemie procured to get and bring these so valiant Knights on his side, and therefore did he guide Floralizas Barke, who on the fourth day of her Nauigation, met with her brother Don Cellindo, with whom she fought a most cruell combat, which for breuity is not recited: but being known for her brother, he en+tred into her Bark, and were directed towards Nyquea, méeting continually all their voyage on the seas, infinit Galleis and shippes, as well Christians as Pagans: where beeing arriued, wee must leaue them a while, to remember Rosabell, whom we haue long wronged with forgetfulnesse.
X. What happened to the most valiant Rosobell, departed from Grecia in the company of a Ladie.
WIth some gréefe of minde (faire Ladies) left wee Rosabell, to sée himselfe absent from the swéete company of his deare Oristoldo, and armourlesse with the Damzell was he shipt in the doubtfull Seas, yet knew not whither: some comfort was it to him, séeing hee had not all his armes, to haue the sword that erst belonged to Hector.
He inquired of the Damzell the cause why with such spéede shee hasted his departure.
For none other (sir knight) replied the Damzell, but to see one of the fairest Ladies in the greatest daunger in the world, and knowing that onely in your presence rests her remedie: and in the least delay, the greatest death that euer befell to any, is sure on her.
For know (most valiant Knight) that in the kingdome of Tentoria, there is a Lady no lesse beautifull, then adorned with all good quallities and graces of the minde.
Shee was and is beloued of all her subiects, because they know that chastitie beautie holds in her one equall degrée of soueraigntie.
Through the onely fame of her perfections, with her the mightie Dardario fell in loue, who was said to be the valiantest Gyant in the vniuerse.
Hee with a puissant hoast came vnto her land, though peaceably: with him hee brought a sonne vnknighted, for his yeares did not allow it, who became farre mightier then his father.
He sent his Ambassadors to our Quéene, to let her know of his comming and demaund, which was to marrie her.
thousand times was my Lady about to stay her selfe, to auoyde a match so vnequall.
She called a Councell of her Nobilitie: who resolued to withstand him with fierce warre, by reason there were many valiant knights that would loose their liues to defend their Quéen and countries safetie: for although they sawe the Gyant come with signes of peace, yet doubttng the woorst, had gathered a great armie of men, because they would not be suddainly surprised.
There were many voyces among them, that the Quéen should marrie him, being Lord of al the Isles in the Adriaticke Sea.
But in the ende, most part agréed, they should rather die with honour in fielde, then for feare suffer such a marriage.
Eight daies respite had the Gyants giuen them for their aunswere.
In which time the beauteous Syrinda commending her affaires vnto the Gods, and her wit, she resolued on the greatest déed that euer Ladie did imagine.
Shee acquainted it with her Captaines and Councell of warre, which are the shiefest Lords in her land: and this it was.
That she would séeme to consent to his desire, and that she durst vndertake in the night of her wedding day, to giue the Gyants head vnto her Knights, who should be in readinesse to issue vpon their enemies, whose vanquishment would be easie, being with the Feasts carelesse and vnarmed.
Almost all the Councell approoued my Ladies deuise, and praying the immortall Gods to giue her good successe therein, they aduertised the Gyants thereof, that with extreame ioy was almost besides himselfe.
All his subiects laying by their armes, with gallant shewes welcommed her answere.
Two daies after, the proude Dardaria entred the Cittie with his soonne Abstrusio, whom hee begot on a strong Gyantesse, and so issued like his Parents.
He onely carried his bigge Cemitor at his side, acco~panied with two Knights richly adorned, and himself in robes of inestimable valor, with a triple crowne on his head, woorth a kingdome, with Princely brauerie was he entertained by the dissembling Syrinda, whom the fierce pagan imbraced with the greatest content in the world, thinking himselfe in heauen, séeing the Ladies excéeding beautie: who with a thousand fained loue toyes inueigled the disarmed Gyant.
The desired night being come, which was eternall to the Pagan, and supper ended, hee was most sumptuously brought to his bedde: where the Lady faining some modest shame to be séene naked, so long deferred her going to bedde, that the force of the many meates and wine, forced him into a sound sléepe.
Hee neuer more awaked: for the Lady seeing her aduantage, drew foorth a sharpe two edged Dagger, which she thrice stabbed in his brutish breast, pearcing his heart therewith.
Now that the couragious Dame was assured of his death, she brauely cut off his head, and presently gaue it to those knights shée had appoynted to expect it.
They tooke it, extreamely ouerioyed, and conueyed the Quéene and Ladies out of the Pallace, for feare of some danger that might happen the next day.
With great desire they expected his comming, whereon scarce had the Sunne sent foorth his messengers of morne, when an alarme was sounded through all the Citie: they of the Campe without, thinking it was in honour of the Nuptialls, replyed with all their millitary Instruments.
In an instant were aboue fiftie thousand men Armed, whereof fiue thousand assaulted the Pallace, leauing none aliue that with Dardario came, except his haughtie sonne, that hearing the noyse, ranne foorth with one of the bedde postes, making such pittiful slaughter that none durst assault him.
He got some weapons of those that were slaine, wherewith his déeds are incredible.
But being alone, and by so many thousands assaulted, his death was certaine: which the sturdie youth perceiuing, got vnto the Camp: where being come, he found it so disordered and so many sayle, and the rest so affrighted, that he could scant méete with any that might tell him the cause of so great euil: in the ende hee came to knowe it with such great griefe, as he was about to kil himselfe: his fathers Armour he put on, and the first he met guirded him his sword.
The fury that possest the youth when he sawe his fathers head pearched on a pole vppon the highest Turret of the Citie, cannot most (valiant Knight) be credited.
Hée went foorth into the fielde roaring like a Bull, and killing without mercy: but his force was to small purpose, for all his Army was discomfited, and the Quéenes subiects behaued themselues so well, that ere the day was halfe spent, they had put the better thrée parts of their foes to the sword, and gaue chase to the rest euen to their shippes, wherein sore wounded, as many as could imbarke themselues, and among them the mightie Abstrutio, purposing with newe powers to returne, and with fire and sword to destroy our kingdome.
In his he arriued, where his intent he presently put in execution, not without griefe, to sée that of fortie thousande men his father had carried with him, he had returned backe againe scarce fiue thousand.
The Paganne spoyles left all our lande excéeding rich: and our Quéene with the greatest Honour that euer Lady obtained.
Notwithstanding the great tryumphes made for so happie victorie, yet would they not liue carelesse of their safetie: but euery day mustred trained their souldiers, and strengthning all their garrisons
with the best men in the land, because they would not loose what was obtained for want of diissipline, béeing assured the sonne would come to reuenge the fathers death: whose body was cast out for foode vnto the byrdes and beasts.
But now (Magnanimious Knight) returning to our purpose, the murthered Gyant had in his owne Pallace my Ladies liuely counterfeite, which he had caused to be made, when hee first became enamoured of her.
This being left at home, came to his sonnes hands, which daily frequenting, and the helpe of his tender yeares, with continuall consideration of the content, which to be beloued of so faire a Lady would yéelde: kindled such a fire in his breast, that he could in nothing delight saue in contemplation of Syrindas bewtie, whose loue so opprest him, as it bereft him of his best sences, and diminished his health.
He resolued to passe vnto Tentoria, and colourably procure alone, what his father with so many men had mist.
He was not of shape and feature nothing so deformed as his Syre, but certainly farre stronger, and higher he is a handfull then any knight, being no Giant.
Arriued in my Ladies countrey, he brought in his company eight Knights, his neare Allyes, of no lesse force then himselfe.
Disguised he entred the Citie, where the Quéene kept her Court, and knowing that she vsed to walke abroade vnto a neare adioyning Groue, he watcht his time, and hauing opportunitie one day, followed her, tooke her, and setting her before him on his horse, carried her away, not dooing nor offering her any discourtesie, though she had most cruelly slaine his father: he tolde her his desire, desiring her not to refuse his marriage, since all the world knew how much it honoured her to doo it.
If like a good Knight (most cruell Abstrusio thou haddest procured my good will, it had not bene much had yéelded to thy request: but since thou hast imployed thy force vpon a poore weake Lady, will rather bee my owne murtherer, then consent to any such thing.
Why then (said the louer) that thou mayest know what assured confidence you may repose on my strength, and arme, Ile giue thée leaue for sixe moneths space to send and séeke about for that Knight, whose Fame aboue al others shal memorise his déeds, to be the greatest with whom hand to hand Ile Combat about thée: proouing, that none but merits thy bewtie: so that if prooue Conqueror, thou take mee for thy husband, with willing and blythe minde: but if be conquered,
vow and protest by all may, to remit and release any action may pretend of marriage towards thée: for which cause, and that the battle may be effected, Ile set thée frée with all pleasure to enioy thy libertie, and this because thou shalt not doubt wil deny the Combat, or violate my word.
Somewhat pacified was the imprisoned Ladie hearing the Pagans offer, and considering that was her best, agreed thereto.
Which gladded the Pagans verie soule, supposing himselfe sure of the Lady, thinking none able to take her by that meanes from him.
While these things past, newes were thither brought of the neuer dying honor ye had obtained in the Iousts of Grecia, ending them to your immortal glorie.
Wherevpon my Ladie thought to none safer then to you, this dangerous aduenture could be recommended, because the strong Abstrusio is the valiantest in all those parts.
She put me in trust with this businesse, being from a childe brought vp in her seruice, which promised to performe with all diligence: and either loose my life, or let you knowe the necessitie wherein left her, trusting that a knight so absolute in all excellencies, would be pitiful, lending his help bound by lawes of knighthood, to a distressed Lady: and let not my report of the Gyants strength, put any doubt in your vnconquered brest: for hauing on your part the strong shield of Iustice, it wil be sufficient to giue you the eternal honor of so glorious a Conquest.
This is the cause braue knight, that hath from such remoted countries brought me to séeke you, and consider whether my iourney be not lawful, and your liberal offer iust.
It is (kind damzel) and am much amazed at ye Gyants tyrannie (said the Prince) to force the Lady against her wil to marry him: and wold were already with him, that (Lady) you might know your Quéenes remedie if it lie in me, is made voyde for want of power, and not wil to hazard my person in her seruice: and my life wil aduenture in any danger, to right the wrong and violence she doth sustaine.
Why then braue knight (said she) may goe merry, séeing you so willingly affected to my businesse, and may the Goddes giue you the due merits your bounteous care deserueth: and séeing that for my Lady you must vndertake such a fight, she sends you Armor and Horse conuenient to cope with such an aduersary.
She drew forth the Armor which were indéed as she said, and excepting his of Hector, he neuer sawe better: of colour they were purple, crost with sanguine barres, garnished with some flowers of rich glistring stones, which more adorned them.
The Gréeke put them on, which fitted him as they were made by his measure.
On his shield was brauely figured the pictures of Iustice and Chastitie embracing, and ouer their heads this motto.
Vpon each other both relies, (Twinnes) kil one, the other dies.
This deuice greatly pleased the Prince, because it iumpt with his businesse.
With these armes was gallant Rosabel armed in, neither in these affaires nor the thought of his hoped battel, forgetting his Lyriana, whose absence not a litle gréeued him, for none had lost such happinesse in loue as he, with so many sighes obtained, and so his sorrow was tollerable, loosing so great good, for none will gréeue at a losse, if the cause be not respected.
Not méeting any aduenture worthy memory, he arriued at the Ile wherereof Abstrusio was King.
Straight leapt he on shore, mounting a mightie roane courser, which the néedy Dame had sent him: then which he neuer bestridde a better, his Bollador, excepted.
The Damozel masked her selfe, for feare of being knowne by any of those that brought her away, when the Princesse was stolen.
They approched very neare the Citie, where the fierce king made his abode.
It was admirable, chiefly the Castle, where the King kept his court, which séemed inexpugnable, both by nature and scituation of the place.
About it, were many pleasant Groues and Meades, where the Pagan often recreated himselfe with Syrinda who by continuall conuersing with the Pagan, his valour and gallant disposition, had excéedingly mollified her obduracy.
And Lyrgandeo saith shee, had repented her selfe for sending her damozel to séeke any by force to plead her cause, being to her honor to take him for her husband, that was able to protect both kingdomes, that vnited was one of the mightiest in the world.
The like imagination had stirred the Gréekes thoghts, thinking that he being so far different from the condition of others, his marriage much aduanced her.
On this considered he, along the Christal Current of a bubling streame, when the mightie Abstrusio walked on the other side, armed in strong plates of stéele, bare headed without helme, to take the coolenesse of the fresh ayre: onely two knights without armor, attended him, bearing his: who was horsed on a furious Courser, his sight greatly pleased the Prince, for his damozel knowing him, told it Rosabel.
At his right hand rode the beautious Syrinda, on a Palfrey: she was gallantly attyred, for being well intreated by the king, she by dooing the like, did more allure him, and he lost nothing by vsing her in that manner, forcing her to doo nothing against her will, which to his soueraigne gentlenesse, may be attributed.
Comming more neare the Lady, knew the Armor and horse which she sent vnto the Knight shuld combat for her.
She was so amazed (though his disposition greatly contented her) that the stoute Pagan noted it, and demaunding the cause, halfe trembling told it.
Oh Iupiter (said the Pagan) how doest thou shew thy immortall power to honour me, sending him at such time hither, whom heartily expected? Now shal you sée faire Lady, whether my valour deserue not some estimation in thy brest, beeing so neare to sée it by experience.
So daunted was the Lady, that she could not answere, reuoluing many things in her thoughts against her selfe: for if she should stay the battel from procéeding, it were to dishonour the knight, hauing sent for him so far, onely to that: and if she suffered it, then she imagined she wronged her Louer towards the Pagan: so that she was set betwéen two contraries, altogither opposed against her happinesse, and which shee might iudge the least to lay hands on, she knew not.
The hastie comming of the Gréeke suffered her not to chuse, for crossing the riuer ouer a bridge, brandishing his Launce, went towards the Louers that greatly admired his comely grace.
The Pagan nothing doubting his hoped victorie, expected him in a faire plain, ioyning to a thicket of tall Pynes, called the Groue of Aduentures, for neuer any entred it, but found something to try the valour of his person.
The Gréeke being come to him raised his Beauer, and saluted him thus.
God saue the valiant Abstrusio: thinke shall not néede to relate the cause of my comming, because it was with thy consent: neuerthelesse, if without battell thou wilt remit the sute thou doest pretend, thou shalt obtaine a sure vnconstant friend: for doubt not, but thou knowest how it staines a Noble minde, by force to force a Ladies will, for it neither belongeth to a good knight nor a true Louer: yet for all this, if thou wilt insist in thy enterprise, let vs no longer deferre the combat, which instantly to be done, will bee too too long.
While he spake, the Pagan stedfastly gazed on him, and iudging
him of great strength, because his constitution was not much lesse then his owne, and this imagination he confirmed, noting the libertie of his words, which he said procéeded of valour, for others at his sole sight, were ready to tremble.
In faith (Syr knight) sée no reason but any thing should be done to obtain your friendship, which oght not be litle estéemed by him that hath it.
But you sée if leaue the battell, it redounds to my dishonor: for it will be said, did it for feare, which could neuer yet be reported, since knew what armor ment: so now to giue occasion of such spéech, he wil not permit that knowes the estimation of true honour, and how it ought to be embraced.
So let our battle be presently, although assure you, more then this, neuer doubted the ende of any: witnesses we shall néed none, for my promise past to this faire Princesse shall be sufficient.
It is so (replyed the Gréek) for since ye one must of necessitie sacrifice his bloold in this field, let the suruiuer be Conqueror Iudge to carrie away the Lady.
Who came to speake vnto the knight, so amazed, that the Gréeke conceiued the cause, and quickly assured himselfe thereof.
It gladded him, purposing if he vanquisht, to marrie her to the Pagan.
Defied eache other had these combatants, and sought for a conuenient place to make the battell, when from the thicket issued a knight vpon a nimble Coueser: he did no more but take viewe of the number that was there, and returned.
Euery one noted him, and mused what he intended by such haste.
But the desire the two had of their Combat, made them forget him.
They turned their fierce horses about, whose successe an other Chapter must vnfold: for it deserueth much more.
The aduenture that befell vnto the two most mightie warriors, being in their combat, and what else happened.
VVIth a thousand amorous doubtes, the bewteous Syrinda expected the two braue warriors encounters, greatly fearing the Gréeke, because she sent for him, and the Pagans successe, good or badde, shee felt in middest of her soule: and eythers blowes shee receiued on her brest.
a more suspitious Iudge: because she through loue, pleades the merits of the one: and the Gréekes worthinesse, the bountie wherwith he vndertooke her cause, inforced her to defend him.
Oh (sacred Damzels, Natures chéefest bewties) lend me some litle fauour, that may woorthily relate the rarest single Combat fought vppon the earth: for the one is Rosabel, of whom the world alreadie trembles: the other, the haughtie Abstrusio, mirror of the Pagan Nations.
The nimble swiftnesse of their horses, was occasion of their quicker méeting, making more noyse in their carrier, then Vulcans forged fire ratling through the skies, renteth his passage, flashing among the darkened Clowdes.
Big and knottie were their Launces, but incountring with their stéeled shields, they séemed of slender willowes: Whose shiuers mounted so high, that their sight gaue notice of that Combat aboue the fourth spheare.
Neither miscarried by the shocke, though both warriours were assured of the others strength.
Amazed was the Pagan, séeing his aduersary in his saddle, for in all his life til then, he neuer incountred any but he ouerthrew him to ye hard ground.
The Greeke drew foorth the Troyan Hectors sword, glad to sée the Pagans valour.
And flourishing it aloft with that celeritie he vsed in all his hattles, let flie at the Pagan: who turned to warde it, yet his diligence preuailed not, for he had not scarce offered his defence, when the skilful Gréeke redoubled the strength of his proffered blowe, and brauely discharged it on his aduersaries shielde, it bootes not to be of fine tempered stéele, for all it reached was throwne to the grassy plaine.
Sometimes would they proffer aduantages, as in a schoole of Fence is accustomed, which would redownd vnto the offerers disaduantage, as now it befel the Gréek Prince.
For spurring his horse, he wold haue giuen the Sarracen another blow before he setled himselfe: he did so, but the vnbrideled fury of the horse, most fiercely ranne beyond the Pagan, whose course Rosabell on a sudden staying, the plaine being wet, his hinder féete slipt, so that both headlong stumbled downe.
Galtenor saith the Gréeke, lost not his saddle: but Lirgandeo affirmeth it: adding, that his fall was the cause he performed one of his vsual acts: for being on his féete, in a drie place he awaited.
The Pagan comming, that eagerly ranne to ouerthrow him: his Horse he would not kil, but méeting brest with brest, with no lesse force then Mars himselfe, hée made both Maister and horse recoyle
backe in such a maze, that hee had time to follow the Pagan, and cast his armes about him.
He was so quicke in performing it, that he had almost pitcht the Gyant on his head.
So Syrindas Louer fearing some euill successe, was inforced to do the like, and shaking the stirropes from his féet, suffred the Greeke to pull him off: who so mightily snatcht him from his seate, that he tumbled him on the ground: but closer doth not the Iuie incompasse about a mosse begrowne Tower, then the Pagan embraced the Brittanicke youth, so that both fell grouelling on the earth, where rising, they beganne a most gallant wrastle, vsing so many slights and trickes, that the God of battelles could no more desire.
And so their wrastle falling out at the beginning of their fight, it longer continued, either procuring some aduantage to get ground of his aduersarie.
Along while striued they thus, till wearie of grappling, wresting foorth their armes, flung themselues strongly the one from the other, with such admiration of those that beheld them, as they beléeued not what they saw.
Highly did the Ladie estéeme the Gréeke, séeing him so brauely maintaine himselfe against him that was famoused to bee the valiantest in all the Adriatricke Iles, who on his owne behalfe greatly misdoubted, iudging his aduersitie the mightiest in the world.
Now kéepe they no order, nor nothing procure they more then death, or eternall honour by conquest of his aduersarie.
One of the worldes best swords was the Gréekes, being at Venus instant request tempered for the Troian, wherefore he neuer strooke blow but it fetcht blood, cut armor and flesh.
And he himselfe receiued them nothing inferior, and though they drew blood through the defence of his armour and dexteritie, yet they brused his flesh in gréeuous manner.
The Pagan at this time assaulted his aduersarie, thinking with that blow to assure the victorie.
But Trebatios kinsman, that was in all things his superior, by stepping aside auoyded it, letting him fiercely passe on, so turning after him, the Gréeke discharged his rage on the others waste, in two he had cleft him, had he giuen the blow with good ayme, yet it put the Pagan in great paine: who for all that, recouering himselfe, at once confronted each other: most mightie were the blowes that fell on their helmes, either drew his sword besméered with the others blood, and with the force of the stroke they set their hands on the earth.
The Gréeke did first rise, being longer winded, and ere his foe was setled in his broken shielde, he gaue him such a blowe, that cutting a great péece off it, descended on the shoulder, where it lighted so heauily, that his knées were forced to the ground: Close he would, thinking to ouerthrow the Pagan.
But this bolde attempt had like to haue cost him his life: for the fierce Abstrutio being verie nimble, and séeing him come vnaduisedly, he set his sword betwéene him, on which the Prince cunning, felt the point in his fleshe, whereat staying, he gaue backwards, else it had pierced a passage for his life.
Héere mist he his good Armor, attributing the fights continuance vnto the want of them.
He turned fiercer then a sauadge Beare vpon the Pagan, who by that was on foote, laying on him so many mortall blowes, that quickly some aduantage was discerned on Rosabels side: but it was such as often his aduersary hazarded his hopes of conquest: for the Pagan séeing how it concerned him, did from his wounds drawe strength, both to defend and offend: which yet made the euent of the battle séem doubtfull: wherin the warriors were eager and gréedie one of the others ouerthrowe, that they spied not till they were almost surprised, who issued out of the Groue: they were foure mightie deformed Gyants, with aboue an hundreth knights, who knowing the Pagan, pursued him for reuenge, by reason of their fathers death, by his, which they deferred til they might take him at some aduantage from his Court.
Well did the haughtie Gréeke guesse at their intent, noting the manner of their comming: wherefore vsing his accustomed magnanimitie, said to Abstrusio.
Leaue we our battle in this estate sir knight, for repose such trust in your person, as when farther occasion shall permit, you wil ende it: and now procure we to defend the Princesse from these knights, whose hastie comming séemes not for peace.
It cannot be exprest how the Princes words gladded the Pagan, who replied.
Your pleasure be fulfilled (Sir knight) for henceforth yéeld to you the victorie of this battle, because farre more your magnanimious bountie deserueth.
The knights were attired after the Parthian maner, with bowes and arrowes, which like a shower of raine they let flie at the two knights, who felt some of them in their flesh through their armor.
To shunne this furie, the Lady was forced to leape from her Palfray, which she had no sooner done, but one of the Gyants with twentie Knights tooke her vp, and in great haste spurred away.
At the outcries she made, her Louer sawe her, and considering his losse, loosing her, said.
Now (most haughtie Knight) must you extend the vtmost of your valour, against these vilde villaines, whilest pursue the robber of my ioy, for without her desire no life.
Do so (braue Knight) replied the Gréeke, for it is reason you should.
And by shedding my hearts deare blood, shall but satisfie my bounden dutie due to the Lady.
Away like the winde in swiftnesse departed the Pagan, leauing Rosabell in the greatest perill in the world: but he was borne to indure them, and incouraging himselfe being alone, couragiously he thrust his horse among that treacherous people.
Neuer did Reaper in Haruest season, with more desire enter his sharpe sickle in the yallow ripe corne, then with furie Lyrianas Louer prest among those Knights, bereauing som of armes, some of liues, and others wounded to the death, some hée cleft downe right, and some hee parted at the waste in two: thirtie Knights had the Gréeke slaine, and wounded many, ere any of the Gyants could at full giue him one blow; so at length one of them preased to him, egerly to execute his wrath: but in the incounter, he opposed himselfe with death.
For although he wounded the Gréeke on the shoulder, yet he not respecting the others blowes, he cast his shield at his backe, and though vnaduisedly he spurred against the Gyant with his sword raised in both hands, it fell on his thicke helme, which vnable to resist, it was with the head cleft in the middest to the necke, felling him downe at his horse féete.
So great was the Ire that possest the Knights, séeing their Gyant slaine, that vnder him they slew the Gréekes horse.
Now hee was in no lesse daunger then of his life: for being on foote, they all ranne to ouerturne him with their horses: some defence found hee behinde the heape of dead Knights, which was nothing, had not fortune hither brought the Tynacrian Polliphebo, flower of Chiualrie: who hauing past many storms in the seas, the heaue~s for eithers good, did cast him on that shore, directing him thither at such time as he might succor his cousin, who like Mars himselfe behaued him, for hauing slaine another of the suruiuing Gyants horses, in the fall he tooke from him an
Iron Mace that hung at the saddle bowe, the which at that instant serued him better then his sword, for with it hee reached more out at length.
The Tynacrian blest himselfe to sée a knight of such force: he iudged him to be a Gréeke, for in them consisted the worldes strength: he said neuer a word, but with his launce aboue hand, like a fierce comet entred among them, killing aboue tenne before he brake it.
Hee would néeds rid the Knight from the Gyant that remained on horsebacke: so drawing foorth his sword, went to him, and taking it twixt both handes, raised himselfe on his stirropes, and finding the Gyant carelesse of him, executed the brauest blow that in all that day was giuen (for he discharged his sword on his middle, higher hee could not reach) in so braue a manner, that from thence downward hee left on horsebacke, tumbling the other halfe at Rosabels féete, that with the noyse of the fall turned about, and séeing a déed so extraordinarie, could not but a lowde say thus.
Oh mightie Iupiter, what vnmatcht incomparable strength is this? He looked on his deuise, yet knew it not, for he had neuer before seene it: but desirous to let him sée what he beléeued, stept with his left foote forward, closed with the Gyant that vnmercifully laide on him, and strongly firming himselfe on the ground, with both hands discharged his sword on his shoulder, which effected such a blowe, as it was doubted whether of the two the God of warre inured: for all that part downe to his legges he cut away: and like an Eagle leapt on a horse that was neare him.
Neither of the kinsmen spake to the other, leauing it till better opportunie, but thrust themselues among that miserable rowte, greeued they were so fewe whereon to shewe their valour.
In lesse then an houre were the two warriours left alone, yet mought it well bee said, in them consisted the most part of humane power.
Togither they put off their helmes, discouering their beautie admired, able to haue slaine Apollos in his glorie.
They were almost of one age, so Rosabell first spake: Most mightie knight, the best that euer mine eyes beheld, make me meritorious, to know to whom am bound for my life: for to your happie comming, when accounted it lost, must attribute my now enioying it.
Excellent and most renowned warriour, there was so little néede of my helpe in presence
of your valour, as desire no thankes for any thing done, being solely due to the strength of your arme: for if presumed to the attempt of any déede, it was onely to haue the fruition of your swéete presence, which bindes me to tell you who am.
Although there want in mee sufficient merits to equall me in valour, to deserue the name of brother to the Emperour Alphebo, Rosicler the most glorious knight of Cupid: am Polliphebo of Tyuaria, sonne to Quéene Garrofileo, and the Emperour Trebatio, and arriued at Greece, with desire to make my selfe knowne vnto my Lord the Emperour, though am assured he is displeased with my cruell mother.
The ioy cannot be expressed, which Rosabell conceiued, séeing him whose fame had filled the earth with immortall honour.
In faith (heroicke Prince) may hereafter thinke my selfe the happiest knight aliue, throgh the knowledge of such an vncle: for know (though my déeds deserue it not) am your cousin Rosabell, of great Brittaine, sonne to Rosicler, and the Princesse Oliua, and he that nothing more desired then to know you.
Oh vnexpected happinesse, is it possible such goodnesse was in a land so remote, reserued for me? what may hope for that will not befall me, since fortune hath so luckily begunne my good, acquainting mee with one of the puissant Emperour Trebatios kinsmen? doo protest (most excellent Prince) this day shall so be inprest within my memorie, that first euery vytall power shall abandon their naturall nation, ere will forget the remembrance of this present content, caused by the knowledge of so warlike a cousin: be assured (deare Rosabel that séeing you are the first haue knowne of my kindred, so you shall alwaies be in all things: for will neuer obey any with more willingnesse.
He performed it better then he spake it, for neuer cousins loued one an other more, nor Rosabell estéemed none of his Vncles as hee did she Tynacrian.
Quickly did Fortune or Nabatos power, (through the Dacians intercession, whom hee accounted as his child) separated them: for the Gréek telling his cousin why he came from Greece, and the necessitie Abstrusio might be in, forced them as quicke as any thought to séeke the Louers.
but being ouertaken by the nights approach, and they following their haste, lost one another in the wood, which so gréeued either of them, as they were readie for gréefe to yéeld their selues: and surely they had fallen into some daunger, (for they had ingendred the greatest affection that can be imagined) had not the wise man comforted them, alleadging how néedfull their parting was.
So he returned the Tynacrian to his damzell, and launching his Barke into the déepe seas, wée leaue him, returning to the Gréeke.
How Rosabell met with Abstrusio, fighting with them that had stolen his Ladie.
How hee ayded him: and after, how he suffered shipwracke on the seas.
CIth some comfort giuen by the wise man, did Rosabel Prince of great Brittaine hast his iourney, ioying in the knowledge of the Tynacrian prince his Vncle: thousand thankes gaue he the heauens, for beeing allied to kinsmen of such might.
Till midnight did he gallope séeking for Abstrusio, wishing in heart he might arriue in good time to lend him his aide: herein would Fortune séeme to fauor him, for euen when faire Endyminos loue shined fairest, then heard he a noyse of blowes and armor clashing.
Lighter then a young wanton Goate, spurred hee thitherward, and entring into a spacious field, hee sawe Syrindas mightie Louer, like a new Mars among his aduerse Knights.
Hée stoode a while gazing on him, glad to sée such haughtie strength, and iudged him woorthie of the Ladies brauerie.
To them, to them braue Knight, for their owne weaknesse shall heere confound them.
The Gréekes couragious words did greatly incourage him, whom knowing, he humbled himselfe for his good helpe: the which hee not a little néeded, for at that instant aboue two hundreth knights vnder the leading of a Captaine Gyant, came marching downe along the fielde against the Pagan: this Gyant was king and Lord ouer them all: the furie which they broght, made the Greke feare the loosing of the Lady,
whom he intreated séeing her on foote, to get vp to the toppe of the hil, and hid her selfe among the trées, whither hee would quickly followe her.
She did so: kindly requesting the Gréeke to looke vnto the safetie of Abstrusio.
It gréeued him not to heare her tender spéech, purposing to marrie them if he could.
Then like a thunderbolt hee turned on his enemies: and with Abstrusio ranged vp and downe among them, dyed to the chinne in aduerse blood, and thogh the Pagan were somewhat wearie with the many battelles of that day, yet the sight of the Gréekes braue déedes, so animated his fainting heart, that hee forgot his wounds, and their paine.
Such miserable destruction on the hard rypened corne, makes not the ouerflowing of an vnstayed current passing his limits, as the two warriours on those coward knights, giuing no blow in vaine, but slew outright, or for euer maimed: which it behooued them so to do, beeing onely two, and their enemies so many.
Followe mee braue knight, (said the Gréeke) for ere we part from hence, vow to be reuenged on these base villaines.
Do what you will (most mightie warriour) answered he, for Ile obey.
His shield he cast at his backe, and tooke his sword twixt both handes, beginning to execute such déedes as Mars would not attempt.
More feared was not Hercules among the Centaures, then Rosabell of his enemies, that beating them downe on euery side, at length he metwith the Gyant that stole the Ladie, whom he assailed with a terrible blowe, and past on, where the Pagan stayed him till he returned, when with both handes hee discharged his sword on his thicke helme, whereon the famous Troyans blade finding no resistance, made his head a good way to skip from his neck.
This pleased him not, so that aboue tenne lost their liues in the conflict: for repairing thither, it was as much as to be ledde to the slaughter house.
By this, the Larke the mornings Herauld, mounting into the loftie ayrie skies, beganne to sing the daies approach, welcomming bright Phoebus to the East, when the two warriours like two firie meteors of heauens consuming wrath, ranging about the battell, encountred in the ende (wearie of killing) with the chiefe and sole suruyor of the Gyants, who roring like a Lyon for his pray, séeking them, met, and with them his death: for stepping betwéene them, with a heauie Iron mace thought to reuenge himselfe at two blowes.
It fell out otherwise, for the furious Gréeke with one stroke cut away halfe his shield, and sorely wounded him.
Heere did Abstrusio brauely second him, though it cost him deare, for thrusting himselfe vnder the Gyants armes, although hee thrust a handfull of his sword in the side of his brest, yet did the Gyant execute his blowe, discharging it on the top of his helme, so fearcely, that sencelesse it strooke him along vppon his horse.
At the noyse the Gréeke turned about, and thinking his companion dead, no Hyrcanian furie may be compared to him.
With more eagernesse furiously flies not the lowring Eagle against the spoiler of his nest, as the Gréeke to be reuenged.
Againe would the Gyant raise his Mace, when with incomparable strength with one blowe did Rosabell throw downe his armes and club: and with a thrust going to runne through the Gyant, he turned aside, making the Gréeke strike his head against his brest, with more strength he embraced him, then Hercules, when twixt his hands he crusht to death two serpents: yet it auailed him not, wanting one arme: for the Gréeke drawing foorth his dagger, terminated that warre with two cruell stabbes.
Dead tumbled downe one of the mightiest Gyans of all those Isles, whose father lost his life by the hand of the great Dardario, the sonne procuring his iust reuenge, sacrificed his blood with honour, being bereft by the Gréek Prince: who fearing to léese Abstrusio, did execute more then humane deeds.
Better was not the Hesperian fruite kept, before Alcydes spoyled it, then Rosabell defended the sounded Pagan, offending his enemies on all parts so lamentably, that woe was to him that approached to trie the effect of his hands: euen as one awaked from a déepe slumper, so amazedly the Pagan raised himselfe, and remembring the state wherein hee was, and what the Gréeke had done for him, said to himselfe.
Oh Iupiter, let me liue, that may gratifie this knight, what his déeds on my behalfe haue deserued.
The furious brauenesse wherewith he behaued himselfe, so animated the stout Louer, that as if but then the warre beganne, he beganne to turne himselfe among them, to the deare cost of many liues.
Follow me knight, for our fighting now is to no more purpose, the drawing of the mornings brightnesse comming on so fast, may
The Pagan followed him, for whom the Gréeke hewed out such ample passage, as he could reach to effect no blow.
They galloped through the thickest of the troupes, leauing behinde them the cruellest slaughter that euer was done by two knights.
They arriued to the hill where the Lady was, there they dismounted to speake to her: who full of ioy (guided by Loue) embraced the Pagan, thanking him for his kinde carefull rescue.
She on the instant perceiued her committed error, but could not salue it: for Lyrianas skilfull Louer, straight iudged the cause, and being glad thereof, knowing the Pagans will, and considering of the signes which the Ladie had showen of her affection towardes him, saide to trie what would come of it.
Now is the time (sir knight) to end our former battell, that may right the Ladie which hath called me from so farre countries.
Both Louers were mooued by the Gréekes wordse, but passing that fitte, and waighing what he had done, Abstrusio thus replied.
Oh Ioue forfende (braue Knight) that séeing you haue so often saued my life this day, should now imploy it against your seruice.
The glorie and victorie of the fight is yours: and more then it deserues your valor, which the heauens haue imparted you: and though it bee more then hell for me to liue without this soueraigne Ladie, so may séeme gratefull to your deseruings, my selfe shall force my selfe to forgoe this happinesse, which is the onely nourisher of my forlorne life.
Woorthie the honour of your high merits (excellent knight) hath this your answere béene (said Rosabell and doe in heart wish my faint woorthes were now equal to my will, that might (were it but in part) pay the great bonds your liberall bountie hath bound me in: and since this Ladie is now infranchised and frée, am readie (as promised her Damzell) to conduct her to her kingdome, or where else she please.
Euer since (sir knight) my fortunes made mee néed your helpe, put my honour in your hands, and so am sure you wil (considering my necessitie) protect it, in liew whereof, vow obedience to all your commaunds.
It fittes so ill (faire Syrinda with my conditions, (spake the Gréeke) to guard Ladies, as the experience haue of my owne misfortunes, enforceth mee refuse this charge, leauing it in the hands of this mightie knight, protesting, that if had a sister, and
with her many kingdomes, would commit her to none other.
And séeing you haue so plainly heard my will, expect your reply according to yours, that hereafter may serue Ladies after a new manner.
knowe not whether of the two were more ioyed with the Princes words, but the Ladie with the accustomed bashfulnesse in such cases, thus replied.
It well appeares (sir knight) you would by all good waies procure my good will to accomplish yours.
But that you may sée, there is in me no lesse acknowledgement of your deserts, then in this knight, for what on my behalfe you haue performed, once againe submit my selfe to your order, to dispose of him at your content, assured that a knight of your worth, wil regard my pure honour as your owne: for hauing put my selfe in your hands, the lawes of knighthood binds mée to it.
The Gréeke did highly (as reason would) estéeme what the Ladie did, and vnwilling to deferre the happie content which the Pagan might receiue, did presently espouse them on the top of that hill, with more ioy then if they were in their rich royall pallace.
Witnesses they did not want, for at the contract there were present, the beauteous Nimphes Oreades and Hamadryades, with many hairie Siluan Gods.
The Gréeke by telling them who hee was, did very much please the new betrothed couple.
There they past away the remnant of the night in pleasant chat, for the Pagan with gladnesse felt not his wounds, and the Gréeke not willing to disturbe their content, dissembled his own.
But when Apollos light expelled Cynthias darknesse from the heauen, all thrée tooke their next way to the Cittie, where hearing what had befallen, they had armed aboue twentie thousand men, the which seuerall waies diuided in many troupes went to séeke their king.
Many of them they met, that greatly reioyced séeing him well, who gaue order for the recalling of the rest backe againe, which was so well followed, that before noone they all returned.
In honour of the Nuptials, throughout the Cittie and all the Kingdome, many triumphs and Iousts were ordained: therein the Gréeke shewed the incomparable valor of his person.
Hee continued there in the cure of his wounds aboue a month, so tendred and honored, as in Greece he could be no more.
So thankfull did the Ladie shew her selfe by her tender care and carefull attendance, that the Greeke accounted all his
At length thinking it time, he tolde the Prince how necessarie his departure was.
It extreamely gréeued them, for they loued him as a brother: They intreated him to stay one eight dayes more, till the ending of an armour which the Lady had caused to be made, hee was constrained to stay because he would not go without them.
well appeared by their riches, the good will they beare to him: they likewise gaue him a lustie strong Courser, wherewith, and with the armes the Prince was well pleased.
He tooke his leaue of braue Abstrusio, and not without many teares from Syrindas faire eyes.
They remained so affected vnto him, that when the Gréeke warres were knowne, this was one brought great ayde thither, dooing the Gréekes such good seruice, that thereby they sufficiently paide the Prince, who with some gréefe for their absence in a well rigged ship, Nauigated towards Nyquea, thinking he shuld sooner there then in any other place, heare of his Lady.
On the fift Nauigation, Fortune already beeing weary of her stay, would shew him one of her fiercest changes, for obtaining Neptunes fauour, she conspired with Eolus topsey turuey to ouerturne the seas, raising such tempestuous stormes, that the Prince saw himselfe a thousand times in the hands of death: sometimes mounted aloft vpon the deuouring rigges of a waue, as high as a heauens wéeping face, and then tumbling downe, as lowe as the lowest Center of the déepe, thinking himselfe and shippe ouerwhelmed in those mercilesse waters, accompanying the watery dwellers in their Cauerns.
Then would he pittie his weake ouermatched vessell, to sée it striue against two such mightie Elementall foes, for hauing lost by furie of the raging windes, all her sayles, her masses, and tackels aboue, was belowe so cruelly assaulted with the seas, remorselesse surges, that beating at her belly and sides, had hewed their passage through her ribbes, entring her breaches so without all pitie, that neither by pumping, nor any other means, her leakes were vnable to be stenched, that the poore Marriners tyred with labour, amazed at the tempests, fiercenesse and confounded with death: submitted to the pittilesse mercie of windes and waters, whose pittious woful clamors piercing the roaring noyse of their opposed enemies, ascended the high heauens.
The casting ouerboord, of goods, anchors and tables, nothing doth auaile, and what in haste they cannot hurle ouerboorde,
the furious winde doth blowe away, and that it leaues, an enuious surge doth wash into the sea.
Thus hopelesse of all remedie tossed vp and downe, for the vnbrideled rage of violent fighting windes, being vnchained from the earthes obscure concauities, blew fro~ euery corner nothing but consuming wrath, death and distructio~, tying their force vpon the smal weak vessell, which they had torne in many places.
Foure dayes fought they thus against the vnceasing dismal tempests, in the end whereof, the poore saylers séeming to foresée an vnlooked for calme, a sudden furious Southerne blast opened the torne Barke, leauing the distressed louer grapling at a planke vpon the whistling Billowes, and yet with his sword in his mouth: for without it (pittifull Ladies) he would not die.
With such violence blew the windes, that violently on a flintie Rocke they hurled him, to whose top, with the strength of his armes he got.
From whence he looked to sée what would become of the ship and marriners, where he saw the lamentable spectacle, the poore Maister ryding on the waters, vpon a Chest, whereon he set all his hope, till a deuouring waue came and bereft him of both it and life.
The grones hee heard, of the rest that perished, séeing the fardels, packes, trusses, caper on the dauncing billowes, and foming waues.
No courage preuailed with them, nor their continuall liuing on the seas: for euery one (as it is wont) it buried in her watery bowels.
So extreame sorrowfull remained the Prince of great Britaine at the lamentable spectacle, that with teares in his eyes he burst forth into this passion.
Oh supreame high heauens, how no man in this miserable world may iustly call himselfe, sure or happie? There is no state, no dignitie, nor office how high soeuer it be aduanced, but is by Fortune, subiect to the greatest and most dangerous falles? Him call happie that least doth set his confidence in Fortune, or hath least receiued of her blinde gifts, terming her benifites, the threatning of greater miserie.
What good is there on earth but is mingled with a thousand vnsauorie displeasing euilles, and of discontents, misfortunes, and lamentable euentes, such and so many, that onely leaue him with his bare name, ouerpressing the soule with torments, and gréeuing the perplexed minde with most gréeuous and wofull paines?
After that, by little and little the furie of the sea was asswaged, he hasted to a coppes that not farre from thence he espied, there to drie
There Trebatios haughtie Nephew disrobed himselfe, leauing but his onely shert vpon him, remembring with some tendernesse the troubles he had ouerpast: iudging by the greatnes of them, they would at length, wearie of themselues, bring him to a delectable sweete ende, that then with the present happinesse he might ioyfully recount his former infelicities.
This consideration somewhat animated him, suffering that distresse more patiently.
Example should they take by him, that in lesse dangers forget to make vse of sufferance, estéeming that death, which peraduenture the celestiall powers doth but ordaine for tryall of theyr workes.
The Gréeke againe apparelled himselfe, his vestments beeing drie, and laid him downe to rest, neuer more destitute thereof then at that instant: it was little, for straight hee wakened to séeke some path which might leade him to some Village: hee found it, but with some trouble: for without it, nothing desired is lightly obtained.
And going along the same, there happened to him, what the insuing Chapter doth mention.
What befell vnto the mightie Rosabell, with certaine other Ladyes, of whome hee learned the countrey wherein hee then was.
Dare almost assure my selfe (faire Ladies) your bewties haue with some féeling (except your harts be harder then the flint, or more obdurate then the Dyamond) attended ye Gréeke princes shipwrack: In faith his worthes deserue it: for hee that with an (ayme) submits himselfe to gréefe, maketh himselfe vnworthie of comiseration, being in necessitie: and yet, neuer any merited fauour, that denied it to the néedie.
Something destitute of it was Olyuias haughtie sonne, but from the middest of his heart drew he strength to resist his woes: who although incompassed on all sides with so many extreames, did neuer forget her, whose fauours were wont to cherish him, and now in absence putting him to his tryall.
This vertue hath true loue (remoueable by nothing from the soule, where it buildeth once his rest,) opposing it selfe against all inconueniences, though ordered by his Lady, whereof being assured, takes them as comforts to his distresse.
Many examples there are of this, yet of them wil recount but one, witnesse my mothers sonne, whom neither the changes of time, nor time altering course of life: nor yet the Mutabilitie of state in life, can make him denie his Captiuitie, nor omit the dulled accentes of an vnaccent passion, with reme~brance of his grones for his vnpittying warres.
And though she know it, and the sinceritie of his affection, yet turnes she away the pittie of her fauour, one telling him his paines are too fewe.
Pittie so vnfortunate a Louer (pittifull Ladies) and yée that shall first heare of his griefe, greater then that which neuer any had, nor worse respected: yet this comfort hath hee, that a lady (excéeded all worth of comparison) moued with his laments, said (vnknowne by whom) vngratefull truth may shee be called, that thus intreateth this distressed Louer: Venus and Cupid reward thée (beautious Lady) and su
am hee wil when thou shalt desire Loues helpe, against Fortunes tyrannie: for the Gréeke Lord suffering his labours with constant sufferance, in the ende obtained his Lyriana, whose onely sight made him déeme all his former discontents, most swéete contents.
With this hope trauelled hee on foote, onely with his sword, hauing taken the straightest and most troden path.
Hee had not gone farre, but vexed with thirst (although newe dryed of waters) he turned vp a long by a cleare streame, till he came to the head of the spring, about which, was builded an Allablaster Fountaine, whose worke, with the clearenesse of the waters, inuited the Prince to drinke.
Which done, he did eate of such frute as the frutefull trées did yéeld, that round incompassed the Fountaine.
Tyred with his former toyles, he laid him downe and slept a good while, resting his rest wanting amorous ioynts.
Farre was he not from the great cittie of Golthuerg, chiefe in the Kingdome of Sylephia, lying betwéene Polonia and Bohemia, and therefore at the instant, he dreamed the swéetest Vision in all his life: for thinking himselfe embraced his Lady, the Princesse Eufronisa, whose beautie was inferiour to none, equalling the fayrest that met in
yeares, which made her as children vse, walke to sport her selfe about those woods that bordered on her garden: and hauing lost her selfe with one Lady, from the rest of her attendants, so amazed was not Venus, when she first saw the boy Adonis along the banks of Nylus, as with admiration the bewtious Eufronisa was astonished with the Gréeke Princes sight that lay vpon the grasse, séeming more faire then when young Apollo in habit of a shéepheard tended Alestes Goates.
He was big of body, his other parts and liniaments are already set downe, although now he entered into they were better perfected.
With more desire did the Lady gaze on him, then in the woods of Troy, the thrée faire Goddesses expected Paris sentence.
So much she yéelded to the sight, that shee began to féele a newe alteration neuer felt before in her heart: for being but a childe, she yet knew not the meaning of Loues pretie fooleries.
With some woonder she turned to her damzell, with these words.
Hast thou euer séene more perfect bewtie then this gallant youth doth shew? beléeue that Nature at his byrth, angrie with her selfe, did thus create him to despight her selfe: cannot thinke but he is child to some of our immortal Gods, that haue now sent him on the earth to alienate all straungers wits.
Which if it be so, we Ladies must strengthen our selues with courage, for feare, the wisest will néed it to scape frée of his sight, so absolute is he in all things.
This aduice came too late to the tender Lady, for Loue had already made her his Goddesse till the death: neither had she power to vntie the knot wherewith blinde Cupid had bound her hart, tying it so hard, as he left it insoluble.
pittie thée gallant Eufronisa, that in the nonage of thy yeares, thou shuldest begin so sower an office, as to be subiect to an vnknown lord, wold willingly giue thée some consolation, but so much do want it, as rather for both should procure it.
No vaine, no colour, no fashion was in the Brytanickes face, but she coted it within her very soule, giuing it the shadow, and her heart the substance, which being so tender and vnacquainted with change, tooke such impression, that neuer Lady yéelded more to loue then Eufronisa.
Now she desires to speake to him, then feares she.
Before she knew who he was, she became so skilfull in the Art, that she feared whether he loued, whether he could loue or acknowledge anies soueraigntie.
Now she that staines the blushing of the mornings Sunne, becomes enuious of her owne thoughts, and doth distrust her owne worths, séeking new deuises and inuented meanes to be beloued, deseruing for her owne bewtie, Ioues immortal worship.
Oh Cupids blind snares, happinesse in misery, a plague in pleasure, and grief without remedy, found vnsought for, and yet a torment that contains a most swéete life.
By her amazednesse, perceiued the damzel her Ladies maladie, wherefore she merily said: Let vs awake this knight, and try whether his bewtie haue more force waking or sléeping.
Doo what you wil (replied she) although it be no modestie considering who we be.
Rather waighing that, thinke it best to do it (said the wittie Selia to sée what he is that hath such power ouer Ladies: for if his merits equals all other parts requisite in a good knight, he may call himselfe one of the happiest in the world.
So long continued the Ladies in their amourous chat, that the Prince awaked with these words.
Oh fortune, how doest thou flatter my hopes, for if thou giuest me any good, tis only dreaming, that when wake to see it, finde it but an illusion.
He said no more, for the Ladies sight staied him, both from the publishing his woes, as of the cause of them.
He rose, admiring the Ladies bewtie: who first spake thus.
You should séeme to haue fewe enemies (sir knight) séeing so carelesly you lye and sléepe in passages so open, that any by you offended, may at his pleasure right himselfe.
He answered: So crosse and austere hath my fortune alwaies bene most bewteous Ladie, that it did neuer let me knowe the state wherin might say had a friend, for euen my owne thoughts doo most within my brest, make warre against my rest: wherefore hauing none to trust vnto, forceth me to set my selfe in the hands of euery one, that one in this generalitie, would shewe the office of a friend, by taking away my despised life, then as such a one should account him, for by the déed giuing me one death, he riddes me of a thousand that suffer in continuall languishment: and it, might wel call life: for he liues well, that féeles no more pain.
Great is your griefe (answered the Ladie) and of force to drawe commiseration from the hardest heart, and greater it is, séeing that none pities you, were it but with a counterfeit remedie, noting the waight of your complaints.
In faith (faire Ladie) said the Prince, so mightie are my oppressions, that although know them, and the paine endure by them, yet must suffer them, for if liue, it is by liuing in paine, so that should I, but neuer so litle ease this paine, it would be séene in the want of my health.
If it doth so please you (replied the Ladie) vniustly you complaine, and thinke you greatly wrong your Ladie, terming her cruel.
My complaints (most soueraigne Ladie) are not so much ment against my lifes directnesse, as against my vnhappie starres, that make me infortunate in fauours, but not in my imployment, for neuer was any better, but in such a place where my griefs be scorned.
Some reason you haue (said the Lady) hauing this occasion to bewaile: for where sorrow is not regarded, there is a double griefe, and gladly would know who you are, and where borne, for you séeme a straunger in these parts.
cannot but obey your soueraigne commaund (most excellent Lady) answered the Gréeke: was borne in the farthest Confines of great Tartaria, and am called Corolano, cast by fowle weather and tempest of the sea, on this Countrey, passing so many troubles, that had not receiued such vnexpected comfort with your faire sight, no doubt, but that my soule séeing the bodie drenched in misery, and as vnworthie to containe it, had it forsaken me, but to enioy within it the view of your happie sight, gaue life to her liuelesse habitation: And that may commit no error (for it is impossible but haue incurred some) suffer my prayers by your admittance to make me deseruer to know the name of the land so happie in the possession of such admirable brauery.
Quickly doo you require a payment for the discouery of your name (Sir knight) replied Selia, (for the Princesse could not, busied in her new and painfull businesse) but because you shall not altogither iudge your selfe vnfortunate in your pretences, know this land is called Sylepsia, whereof this Lady is Princesse, and going on hunting, we lost our company and our selues: yet wee haue not hunted ill, hauing founde the amourousest knight in the world: and so according to your showes, none like you haue better assuraunce of the Louers Tent, whose aduenture was newly brought into this Cittie, and the proofe thereof shall within these foure daies be begunne, and little shall you not please vs to hazard your person in the tryall.
am so ill prouided of Armor and other necessaries, (faire damzell answered the tender Prince) that though were vnwilling to do it, yet to content your bewties, with them would try it, assured that for louing and being vnfortunate, to me the glory is onely due.
This want shall not hinder you (said Eufronisa for will furnish you with the best armor that euer you saw, earst belonging to the first king that raigned in this countrey, named Tersio, equall in soueraigntie of Fortitude and Wisedome, strengthened by Art and skill wherewith he forged them, and neuer were séene by any.
These ile send you by this damzell, first swearing you shall not absent your selfe from this Kingdome without my leaue, and in our Pallace shall you be cherished.
The amorous Lady spake so plainly, as the Prince could perceiue Loues new wound.
There is none so destitute of iudgement, but wold haue weighed what he obtained to be beloued of so faire a dame: for if the Prince had euer séene pure bewtie, she was the perfect stampe therof: in whose creation, Nature the olde Mars of liuing forme, had shewed the vtmost of her skill, modeling her liniaments, more absolute then thought could wish.
Among so fewe yeares as they both had, was neuer seene completer excellencies: so he answered.
Who dares most soueraigne Lady, shew himselfe so vngratefull to the fauours imparted by your rare bewty, as to commit a fault so hainous to depart from you without your license? am so long since captiue to anothers wil, as now to acknowledge it anew is no pain, but rather chéefest happines, knowing to whom owe seruice.
Why then (said she) we may be gon, assured you will do no otherwise, and this night will send you horse and Armor, whose sight will content you: In the meane time hyde your selfe amongst these Pynes: for hauing lost our selues, it cannot bee but our Guard will seeke vs out.
The Gréeke now had no more will but to fulfill the Ladies: and so taking his leaue of the young childe, already olde in loue, he thrust himself into the the thickest thereof.
Without a thousand embracements she had not sent him, feared she not to be too much noted of wa~tonnesse, yet with her eyes she exprest her hearts desire.
They are (soueraign dames) the tonguelesse messengers that best make knowne the paine and plea+sure of the soules.
Better signes of like or dislike, is there not, then the motion of those spéechlesse speakers.
As one rapt in a dustie blacke clowde, so séemed Eufronisa in absence of her sonne.
Ay me (my Selia said the amorous Ladie, what in auspicious lucke crosses my tendernesse to affect the knight that hath alreadie another granted the possession, of his soule? Who can loue him, knowing hee affects another, wherewith the heauens haue adorned mee, and yet not made me proude? for if he loues another, how shall loue him, being sure that for my sight hee will not violate the promise of his sacrificed faith, and yet who will not dote on him? What inconueniences can restraine me from his loue? what infamie, what dishonour, or what staine of maidens fame may befall me, but my soule will regardlesse trample on, so with equall loue her paines might be rewarded? Why, doo not feare the foolish rude reports of common multitudes, when they shall ioyne their mouthes to fames shrill trumpe, far and neare to sound my shame, when this my folly shall bee noysed abroad will loue and dote on him, and yet do beléeue, that doing so, do not sufficiently answere the merits of his valour, nor noble carriage of his minde.
And though it be a torment intollerable, to knowe another is inshrined in his brest, cannot refuse the diuine appoyntment, nor what heerein my haplesse fates ordaine: for otherwise, none more happie then in loue: and cannot beléeue he is as hee hath said to bee, for these that haue the power to bee beloued of euerie one, doo neuer disclose their true names, countrie, and estates, wherefore wee must by all meanes procure to learne his certaine name, for beeing intreated thereto, do not doubt but he will.
That he is easie to be knowne (answered the damozell) hauing him in our lodging, for if he be in loue, (as he séemed to be) being alone, hee will publish it, and perchance more then we now wish, for intire loue cannot be husht in secret, and euery one too much bragges of this blind opinion, as to account the greatest comfort to participate the inward thoughts, to stones, to wals, to groues, to fields, and windes.
Ay me (my Selia by experience thou doest shew to haue ben in loue (said Eufronisa who can discourse of seas, of rockes, of shallowes, and of tempests, but such as haue nauigated, scapt and past them? What is hée that feares his enemie, that hath not béene wounded at his hands? If this bee so, and thou so skilfull, will repose the trust of this my businesse, on thy discretion and experience.
Had it béene for nothing but to helpe you in this tempest, (soueraigne Ladie) answered Selia, account the time well bestowed, spent in Loues toyes, letting my soule confesse with content, anothers superioritie.
am well acquainted with Loues deuises and his allurements: know where he is resisted, there enuiously hee striues to subiugate new forces, causing afterwards greater paines for refusing his deitie, and denying his prerogatiue ouer all the world, as hee that can onely giue life or death with ioy.
Why then (my deare Selia said the Princesse, it is likely he wil not so cruelly tyrannize ouer me, that willingly admitted the heauie yoake of his slauerie, as he vseth against them that leuied armes and warre against his power.
To demaund no condition of this God, is best for gouerning absolutely by himselfe, doth not (being blinde) consider the gréeuous paines the soule indures, and many times with a little, rests hee more content, (in the end hee is but a childe) then if a thousand hearts were sacrificed to appease his wrath.
They could procéed no further in their sweet chat, for many knights came to them that carefully did séeke them, fearing some disgrace had befallen them.
They were glad whe~ they met them, so altogither returned to the Cittie, for the Princesse would no longer stay, hauing alreadie foode to nourish her conceits.
The night beeing come, they bound the armour in a bundle, and the Ladie sent to a kinsman of hers, whom shee trusted to make readie the best horse within the Cittie.
He did it, desiring to do her seruice, which when she knew, making him sweare to keepe her counsell, she bad him go with Selia, for she had promised a knight to furnish him, to prooue the Louers tent.
So leauing her, they arriued in good time at the fountaine, where they found the Gréeke ouerwhelmed in imaginations, expecting the Ladies commaund.
The Ladie (sir Knight) that met you here this day, sendes you this armour and horse, for seeing you promised her to prooue the aduenture of the Louers tent in her name, shee thought good to furnish you with necessaries therefore.
Faire damzell, you may tell that Ladie, that with such a fauour, a harder enterprise is assured.
They would not talke of other matters, because of the olde mans presence, more then to giue him direction for his way, and therevpon departed, leauing the Prince expecting the comming of the next morne, wherein faire Ladies there befell him what you shall heare.
What happened to the Prince Rosabell, going to the Cittie to prooue the aduenture of the Louers Pauilion.
VNable to conceiue the cause why that beauteous Princesse should shewe him such kindnesse, laye Rosiclers braue sonne vppon the grasse, passing away the night in that thicket, looking for the desired morne, meane while, taking some rest.
Two houres before it did appeare, he awaked with the remembrance of his lost Ladie, recording with what rigor fortune had crost his ioyes, iudging his shipwracke was not yet an end vnto his troubles, thinking that yet the blinde Goddesse was not content with his tried patience.
He hartily wished to know new meanes to indure such excessiue torments as he daily suffered.
This imagination so opprest him, that to ease with passage his burthening passions, he beganne to plaine him to the trées, that with their stirring noyse, mooued by the gentle blasts of Zephyrus, séemed to pittie his laments breathed against her, whose mutabilities are the plagues and scourges of mortall men.
They were not vttered with such silence, but might bee heard by Astorildo Prince of Callidonia, brother to the beauteous Rosamond, that departing from his sister in Greece, (glad in his soule to sée her so well bestowed) trauelled to séeke aduentures through the world, performing many braue déeds vnder the name of the knight of the Griffon, all which are at large set downe in the Chronicles Lupercio writ of all the Pagans acts.
Galtenor doth not here mention them, because they appertained not vnto the storie he composed.
So now was the frée Pagan ouerhearing the Gréekes complaints: he was not mooued at the~, for he had not yet yéelded his libertie to loue.
It fell out as hee would haue it, for hee vttered many pittifull exclaimes, afore Auroras shining in the heauens, yet could he not by them iudge who he was, more then the constancie he publisht of his Loue: who was so carefull to go vnto the Cittie, that in the instant he put on the rich armour Eufronisa had sent him.
Such were they as appertained to a nouell knight, all white, bur garnisht with many flowers of precious Rubies.
They greatly pleased him, being of the best in the world, as also because with such of like colours, he departed from Nyquea, and combatted with his father.
His shield was like his armour, in middle thereof, bearing the picture of Faith, held by a white hand, which for all that two Serpents with their stinges did pricke, would not loosen it.
Clad in these faire armes, and mounted on a lustie Courser, did Trebatios haughtie Nephew pace on towards the famous cittie, glad to sée it with so many Danubious streames, which made it one of the fertilests soyles in the world.
The same way did he spye the valiant Astorildo, in faire gréene armour full of Pomegranates, and on his shielde a fearfull Griffon.
Wonders had Rosabell heard of him, reioycing to sée him of such braue disposition: so did he admire the Gréeke, supposing he was him, that in the Forrest he had heard complaine, hee gazed on him a while, iudging his behauiour to excel his that in Grecia had ouerthrown him.
Hauing each met with the other, they extended such courtesie, as they iudged eithers merits to deserue.
would gladly knowe (sir knight) who you are, for it séemeth to mee, haue séene you farre from hence.
In the same tongue replyed the Gréeke, beeing well skild in most.
am (sir knight) of such remoted countrie, that though should tell my name, you could not knowe me: notwithstanding through those places haue trauelled, and where am best knowne, am called the Knight of the Flowers, beeing by stormes and fortune of the seas, cast on this land, where vnderstood, there is in the Kings Court, a certaine aduenture arriued very lately, which ere did depart, was willing to know and prooue it, hazarding but little thereby, being on Ladies behalfes, whose seruice brings with it a reward for any paine how great soeuer, although it should be thought none done in a Ladies name.
There is reason (replied the Callidonian to procure their content with perill of our liues, but this must be with assurance of reward.
Then deserues he not to bee beloued, that doth it for reward.
Neuer (sir knight) was that loue famous, whereto a recompence was proposed, which must by deserued loue be obtained: for as loue is the motion of a noble act, for which all good is desired to the thing loued, so doth not hee merit that honoured, title that séekes it for any other thing, vnlesse it bee to let the world admire the rarenesse of his quallities, not inclining to the other, which rather is a price prefixt for loue, dishonouring the reputation of the Louer, and disableth his worthes, through the hopes of that guerdon which otherwise might make him most happie.
And well it séemes you knowe not what it is to bee anothers, alleadging such an irronious opinion, condemned of all that knowe what happinesse it is, happily to loue, which makes me smyle to thinke how safe the Tent is from you, for being to be giuen to louers, your libertie excludes you from that priuiledge, which by being one, you haue obtained.
would not haue you so rashly iudge, by what you knowe not (replied the Pagan) for you may be deceiued.
How should be (said the Gréeke) hearing you so plainly vrge your libertie? Nay then (returned the Callidonian that you may know the vnaduisednesse of your iudgement, say, none shall prooue it, vnlesse he first prooue mee vpon the spéeches wee haue vrged, for who the diuell hath euer loued, without hope of something.
That hope (answered Rosabell somewhat mooued) the Louer must not haue, but leaue it in the Ladies dispose, for it is shee must consider the merits of that faith, wherewith shee sées shee is adored, and according to those deserts and her bountie, she yéeldes the due reward.
And am sorrie wee should with new brawles enter into the Pallace, and beeing first aduertised of the aduenture, the first triall ought to bee mine.
And so about both matters (hauing now opportunitie) let our battell be, with this condition, (least we want time for the aduentures promised) that hee which forgoeth first his saddle, shall not sée the aduenture, vnlesse he be commaunded by the conqueror.
Nothing doth better please me (said Astorildo that you may know your error by your loue.
So these two famous warriours turned their horses brauely confronting each other.
The Pagan was one of the greatest that the Gréeke had receiued, for it cast him backwards on his horse, with losse of both stirrops: but the Pagan chaunced woorse, for Mars on horsebacke equalled not the Prince, that met him so strongly, that fetching him cleane from his saddle, he fel on his féete.
Recouer he would his seate before the Gréek returned, hauing the bridle in his hand, but the horse starting at his offer, mounted aloft and put him from it, that the Gréeke when hée turned, sawe him on the ground: where hee required the combat with the sword.
We should so stay ouerlong (said the Greeke) for fear therof made me condition thus: but we shall haue time ere you depart this land to do it, the which promise to performe, bee it but to disswade you from your heresie.
And that you may beginne to credit me, am content you first prooue the aduenture, so shall you sée what aduantage you should haue, not hauing this opinion which your libertie makes you maintaine.
Otherwise could not the Pagan do, for noted he would not be of discourtesie: so he promised to accomplish it, and mounting againe like two great friendes, they tooke their way to the Cittie, arriuing there at the first houre after noone, when all the principall thereof repaired to the Pallace to sée the aduentures proofe, togither with many valiant straungers that about it were thither come.
As these two warriours passed through the stréetes, al the peoples eies they drew after them, admiring to sée them so well armed, of so braue disposition.
Gallanter Knights were not in that Cittie séene of many yeares before.
As too and fro the streetes were crossed by passengers that went to the Court, and they doing the like, the sunnes splendent rayes reuerberated on their glittering armour, as no sence could more desire.
The amorous Eufronisa lost not this sight, for standing on a turret, she sawe the maiesticke pacing of her gallant, and said vnto her selfe, shée had giuen him but litle to make him Lord only of her hart.
Ladie (saide Loues newe Scholler) that hath more reason to loue then I, since (in my opinion) the Gods haue not reserued vnto themselues, more grace, more brauerie, nor more woorth, then they haue bestowed on this knight.
Somwhat did this deefied couple prick their horses, and passing vnder the Ladies being, the Gréek made his, bend his knées to the ground, and his head lower then his brest.
The Ladie séeing it, raised her selfe to do him courtesie, which as a fauor she bestowed, not respecting how she might be noted for it.
Near her stood her wittie Selia, that burst into these words.
cannot blame you, (soueraigne Princesse) for louing him that was borne to be beloued, and if for him you suffer, he hath with him a remedie for your greatest maladie, and therefore doo not complaine, for if you do, Ile sweare you do dissemble.
If there wore any with him, that would so well plead my deserts to him, as hee hath here to read his merits to my beléefe, it might bee should bee able to dissemble my paine when it takes me: yet can not denie what thou alledgest, for his gallant behauior is a comfort in middest of my greatest woes.
The two famous Knights alighted, for the hall (being one of the fairest in the world) was full of knights, that expected the proofe of the Louers Pauillion.
In the outward yarde they left their horses, and as friends togither entred into the hall, hauing round about an infinite of rich seates, excepting a corner, purposely hung and reserued for ye Ladies that then entred, whose beautie and brauerie delighted euerie heart.
The most beauteous Eufronisa would not differ in her colour of garments from the Brittains armor, apparrelling her selfe al in white, imbrodered with red roses, that neuer to the Ladies sight it admitted no compare.
This occasion expected Cupid to yoake the brest of warlike Astorildo, that in scorne of him had long time led his life: and so with the sight of the Ladies rare beautie, he was beset with new desires, féeling his heart subdued.
wound was this he receiued, that onely death cured, for that solely had power to remedie it: for the Ladie busied her eies gazing on the Gréek, he thinking on Lyriana, in whom his hopes, life, felicitie consisteth.
So that only Loue must please this third intruder: for Astorildo alreadie loues, his life depends on his alienation: now he gréeues for appoynting combat with the Greeke, séeing it toucheth what hee adores, and with a word he hath euen now changed his opinion, by beeing in loue, and without hope euer to obtain any recompence for his distresse.
And yet the Ladie scorning the firmnesse wherewith he loues her, placeth it in affecting him that laughes at her, because he dotes vpon Lyriana.
So the Ladies sate them down, being aboue a hundreth in number, daughters to the chiefe Nobles of the Realme.
When all were silent, an ancient graue man, for so he was that brought the Tent, did set it in middle of the hall.
fairer péece was neuer séene: it was all of blew Sattin, imbroderad with Artechokes of golde, set with so many stones, that their splendor depriued the sight of it.
At the doore thereof appeared two knights richly armed, that séemed to challenge the fight of euery one present: within was séene a faire throne, wheron sate a Lady of excéeding beautie, holding in her hands a crowne of inestimable value.
Thus euery one expecting to knowe of the ancient knight the sum of the aduenture, the Ladies and knights yéelding him gratefull audience, he beganne to recite the cause of his comming, whose relation deserues a new Chapter, inferring mee to intreat of you, faire wonders of natures beauties like attention, for now haue most néede thereof, expressing a matter of it selfe so worthie to be knowne.
How the knight ending his relation of his aduenture, his knights began to prooue it, and what them befell.
MO&st high and mightie King of Sylepsia (began the ancient knight) in the Southerne parts and regions of the world, there sometimes dwelled a man in the hidden and secret misteries of Art and Nigromanticke spels the skilfullest of his time, whose knowledge and great wisedome could not keepe him from the snares of deceitfull loue, who intrapt him with the beautie of Belisa, daughter to the king of Arabia the Felix, one of the fairest Ladies on the earth, who gouerned with higher thoughts, admitted not the wise Nycostratos affection.
He atchiued many woorthie déeds in her seruice, yet all would not preuaile to mooue the Ladies loue, nor yet to shew him one counterfeited fauor, which put him in such desperation, as daily he neglected the estimation of his credit, more more lost his health.
On this Ladie were also inamored two Princes, alike in valour and deserts, though one was more happie hauing the Ladies fauor: who fedde him with those hopes that they are woont to giue their louers, al which was woorse then death to the wise man, as also to the other knight reiected.
So Nycostrato knowing it, as also the approach of his liues fatall houre, finding that Belisa was cause thereof, purposed ere he lest the world, to be reuenged, so formed he this wondrous Tent, where hée inchanted the Ladie, bereauing her of iudgement, for the litle respect she had made of his great loue.
Also he enchaunted the two louers to defend the entrance, vntill there were a knight so amorous and valiant, but as vnhappie as eyther, that by vanquishing might restore them their lost libertie.
And Belisa, by the Lady that without exception, best deserued the tytle of constant Louer, yet woorse rewarded: for onely this to be fayrest, must frée enchaunted Belisa.
In the estate they be, they suffer many torments: for so pleased it Nycostrato, the more to satisfie his reuenge.
That knight that is fauoured by Fortune, shall end the Combat, must after leade the Lady that will prooue the aduenture.
In many courts of mightie kings haue we bene, hoping to finde some knight to set a periode to our trauell: but the Princes being valiant, and the Lady very faire, none hath preuailed, no not so much as in the entrance.
Almost dispairing euer to finde remedie for these Princes, heard of the famous knight and bewtious Ladyes of your Court.
With some better hope turned hither, which trust will not be frustrated, considering the worthies here assembled of eyther kinde.
So humblie beseech your Maiestie, commaund your knights vnto the proofe, for no small honour shall hee win that ends it.
There were so many desirous of it, as they expected but the kings commaund, among them were two of the kings Coozens, both louers and reputed valiant.
Many proouing the entrance, and loosing it, made shew of their valour, attributing their losse not to it, but to their happinesse in loue, and so returned with great comfort, thinking they had obtained much thereby.
The Prince of Laronia, a young knight, but a notable louer, prepared himselfe: who drawing forth his sword, made against the two competitors, beginning a well sought combat: but after a while he retyred backe, vnable to endure his enemies strong blowes.
No longer stayed the kings two Coozens, but one after an other made knowne their valour vnto the beholders, yet in the end were forced to withdraw.
More couragious warriors had not the King séene then those of the Tent, who in lesse then two houres had ouercome aboue fiftie knights, besides the strangers the chiefest of the land.
Onely now were left, the mightie Gréeke, and Astorildo: who taking his leaue of the Gréeke (with whom he would not haue no longer quarels) drew forth his sword and marched towards the Tent.
The Prince was most skilfull in fence, and so marked the maner how they kept the
doore, where carefully fixing his eyes, flourishing aloft, let flie
They of the Tent, stept out toward them, which was to their euill, for he in despite of them woon the entrance, whereat so many warlike instruments were heard, as if some generall fielde were to be fought.
All the Hall did verily iudge he would win it: for being within, his déeds were incredible, so be labouring the Louers, as were he a little vnfortune, Galtenor, doubtlesse he had saued Rosabell a labour.
For one of the Princes (being the beloued) going to wound him below the shield, Astorildo auoiding it, ran at him with so strong a thrust, that hee tu~bled him bacwards vpon the steps that ascended to the Lady.
Being rid of him, he might execute a blowe vpon the others helme, it was with such force, as hee was forced to set his knées vppon the ground, run to ouerthrow him he would, which was the losse of his battell, for the other abashed at his hap, stept thither, and with both his hands laid on Astorildos helme, which made him stagger, like to fall.
An other seconded the Competitor, with no lesse might then that which made him set both hands and knées on the earth.
They cast theyr armes about him, and though he a while delayed his vanquishment, in the end he was thrust out, winning more honor then any had before him.
Now was none left but Lyrianas Princely Louer, who rising from his seate with excellent Maiestie, drew forth that worthie sworde that once belonged to the mightiest and greatest enemie the Gréekes had.
There was none, but with admiration gazed on the Brytaine, for his gallant carriage assured the victorie.
More eyes then Argos had, wished the Lady, to cote all his perfections, for she loued him dearer then her life.
With furious pacing went the Gréeke towards the Pauillion, whence was heard, what neuer was before, for the signall as to a battell of seuerall armies was sounded, with many shoutes and clamors, that it drowned euery ones hearing.
Which being past, with more warlike aspect the two Competitors awaighted their aduersaries comming: with their swords aloft they expected him that with his accustomed courage went neare them: at once they discharged
mightie blowes, yet bigger they must be to hinder him the entrance, for with a leap, ere they could again raise their swords, he ran in betwéen them, and méeting with ye vnbeloued, with his shoulders thrust him fro~ him, fiercer then a bullet shot from a musket.
wound him, which the Gréek being (skilfuller then he) nimbly auoided, and discharged his furie on his helme.
The enchauntment is vnable to resist the sharpe edge of Hectors blade, for it cut all the top, wounding him a little on the head.
Before he could settle himselfe, hee turned vpon the other, giuing him a puissant blowe on the shield.
All that his sword reached it cast to the ground, leauing his arme with such extream paine as he could scarce stir it.
Excéedingly praised in the Hall was the valour of the knight of the Flowers.
New baites for Eufronisa that gaue eare to them, with more affection then Venus, when she met Adonis going to hunt.
Yet now hath she no more to giue him, hauing done it all afore, saue constancie doth shee procure to maintaine, wishing him a happie victorie, which was to some effect, for the Competitors came onely to fight, and thereto do animate themseleus: but he that was borne in armour will not be daunted with feare, bestowing neuer a blowe on the Louers, but makes them with hands and knées kisse the earth.
None doubts the victorie, generally giuing it to the Gréeke, that like a Lyon fought betwéene the Competitors.
The vnbeloued thrust at him strongly with his sword, thinking to haue runne him thorow, so much he made him giue backe, he seconded an other, which was trebled with a cruell stroke vpon his head by the Fauoured.
Something they amazed him, and doubling their blowes againe, made him set one knée on the grou~d.
Hold on him to wrastle would Belisas Louer haue taken, but Rosabell refused it, giuing on his head so mightie a blowe, as sencelesse at his féete he cast him.
Swifter doth not an Eagle take her flight, then hée turned vpon the vnbeloued, and twixt his armes he raised him aloft, and breathlesse threw him to the earth.
greater noise did not Illiums tower make when it fell, then was heard at the Louers fall.
Ouercast was the Pauillion a while with a thicke fogge, which being past, it appeared as before, sauing that the knights lay at the Ladies féete, that then séemed fayrer, hauing an other Crowne on her head, besides that she held in her hands.
With the sound of heauenly musick there also appeared the adue~ture of Hope, which Don Eleno discouered at Esclauonia: and at the Ladies right hand, an old man that was iudged to be Nycostrato.
So soone as the knights were vanquished, the auncient knight said to Rosabell.
Most valiant knight, you may highly thinke of your selfe, hauing to your immortall glory ended, what in so many yeares could neuer bee attained.
Now remaines, that the Ladies you leade, by you do prooue the aduenture of the Crownes, and hope also here to see it terminated.
Euery one in the hall gréeted the knight of the Flowers, with much ioy: neither exprest nor thought may that be, which Eufronisa did receiue, séeing what her knight with such honour had obtained, calling her selfe a thousand times happie, for placing her affection on him.
The proofe of the Crownes was begun by the ladies, with some feare, which notwithstanding was lessened by the Knights company.
One of the Kings Nieces, a Lady of rare bewtie, taking the Knight by the hand, said.
would be sorie Sir Knight, that through my company you shuld loose what euery one knoweth your valour doth deserue.
That is it feare (faire Lady) that my vnfortunate hap may debarre me from the honour your bewtie had assured.
Which being not so great as Belisas, made her returne without the Crownes: but with more glorie then any other had got, hauing ascended to the highest step where the Lady sate.
beléeue (Sir Knight) said the olde man, you haue attained a troublesome office by vanquishing the two amorous Knights.
It is a pleasure (replyed the Prince) being in seruice of Ladies.
Now onely remained Eufronisa, fearing she should not obtaine the victorie: iudging the enchaunted Princesse to be fayrer, yet euery one was of contrary opinion, although the Arabian was very faire: but being so neare him, she had impressed in her soule, added bewtie to her bewtie, that when she came to the tents doore she séemed Angelicall.
She was not able, nor could shee there otherwise fauour her gallant, then to wring him by the hand, that if Lyriana had not bene possest of his heart, it had bene no woonder if she there had made him her prisoner.
With a most solemne consort of melodious harmonie, were the two different Louers receiued.
Hauing entered the Pauillion, many Nymphes strewed all their way with swéete odorious flowers, of whose pleasant smell all the hall participated.
With more ioy did she mount the staires (the~ the Carthage Dydo entred the Caue, where she found her deare Aeneus till she came vnto the top, where the princesse Belisa rising, welcommed her, and taking off her Crowne from her head, set it vpon Eufronisas, saying.
Princesse, as a token acknowledge the soueraigntie of your bewtie ouer mine.
And in assurance of the excéeding loue must beare you, and the extreame paine you shall endure, take this at my hands, which if you put on, when most you shall dispaire of comfort, this shall giue it you, though short and after, paine till death.
But what thereby shall ensue, shall for aye content you.
And you most glorious knight, though Fortune hath hitherto most cruelly persecuted you, haue courage against her chaunges, for you shall not return to Greece without the thing your soule most loues.
The Lady had no sooner ended what shee would say, when on a sudden the Pauillion vanished, onely leauing the beloued Prince in all his iudgement with the Lady.
sentence was proclaimed, wherby was gathered, that the vnbeloued Lord in recompence of his saith, so ill repayed, went to accompany amorous Celio, in the Castle of Hope.
Euery one reioyced therat: for his loue to Belisa merited some reward.
Who was most courteously entertained by the King with her beloued Prince, excéeding ioyfull to be at libertie, in company of his Lady, that assured his happinesse with a kinde looke.
The Ladies intreated the Gréeke to vnloose his helme: he refused it, till Eufronisa with a wincke did bid him.
He obeyed, which more allured the Lady, his bewtie increased as much admiration as his valour, for being heated by the battel, it was the greater.
Some there was that said, it equalled the Ladies, and hauing as yet no beard, and being like his mother, no maruell if it were so compared, making the Ladies enuious of his graces.
Among them he sate him downe with the greatest content he euer receiued, excepting that his Lady gaue him, when she receiued him as her husband, although hee lost her at the instant.
There discoursed he with them, some demanding who he was, others, whether he was in loue, and others where his Lady was.
With such wit, and discretion he answered them al, as he greatly gained theyr good willes.
With her eyes did Eufronisa speake to him, till the nights approch made him take his leaue of the king, whose importunities could not make him stay.
Softly did the Lady remember him of his promise of Belisa and her Louer, he craued leaue, leauing them much bound vnto him, he demanded of the knight of the Griffon, whether he wold stay there or no, for he could do no otherwise but depart.
Sir knight, in my soule would be glad of your company, gréeuing that euer crost you in your words: but at this time am forced for a while to abide in this countrey, vntill bee aduertised the contrary from mine: and if in any thing my person or what haue may do you seruice, bee assured will performe it with my life.
The Gréeke gratefully accepting his offer, departed out of the Pallace, and on his lustie Courser went out of the citie, minding being more darker, to returne and kéepe his promise.
How the Prince Rosabell returned to the citie, and what befell him, with the Princesse Eufronisa.
WHere haue hitherto implored the fauour of your desired aid (most faire and only worthy to be most faire Ladies) to prosecute this storie to record of your fames, the imaginary grant thereof, hauing brought me to this stay, doubts his sufficiencie farther to procéed, vnlesse it be anew allowed, and sealed with a pardon, which for your owne sakes, gentlenesse and pittie, hope for my selfe shall obtaine, being but the interpreter of my Authors offence, committed by the Gréeke, against your search: although it was done by him, constrained by her, to asswage the burning fire of Eufronisas loue, and to remooue the desperate violent passions of the same.
Whose reading (oh thinke then how you haue pardoned me) craueth such extenuation, as patiently you will not denie: for his returne will offend your bewties, violating plyted faith to Lyriana, by which iniurie, your worthes cannot but receiue some detriment.
And so comming to the place appointed him by Selia, he left his horse among the trées, to féede alone maisterlesse: although he was not long without one, for being so good, hee did not little estéeme him, that tooke him thence.
But Rosabell went straight vnto the ladies garden, and knocking at the doore, Selia opened it, saying.
Now are you worthy greater estimation knight of the Flowers, th you wold so willingly come and obserue your word, which may attribute to your sufficient vertues.
Farre vnworthy of fauour were hee (faire damozell) that would not know what happinesse by doing it is obtained.
Why thou come with me (said she) for Ile commit you to better hands then mine, and since you haue this day displeased me, proouing of the Crownes, do not maruel, if should put you in such a prison, as Iupiter would not leaue the Empire of the heauens to liue in it.
Any thing procéeding from you (gentle Lady) Ile accept as a fauour (answered the Gréeke) being assured, that since you know my will, you will not be against my content, which shall estéeme most great, to worke yours.
And they arriued at the Ladies lodging, where they were forced to silence, least they should be heard, and the Prince tooke off the armor from his legs.
So went they euen where Eufronisa did expect him fairer then Diana, yet so abashed and fearefull, that though she saw him, yet could not speake.
But from her weakenesse she drew strength to say, embracing him, now Loue began to helpe her.
would not (valiant knight) haue you attribute this my boldnesse, to more then to requite what am indebted to you, hauing this day to your high honour, most noblely honoured our court, where my selfe also had part (through your valour) of the glorious end of the aduenture.
In eternall records of liuing memorie to succéeding ages shall this remaine, togither with this my wanton déed, if it be knowne.
There nothing happened this day (most soueraigne Princesse) but was atchieued vnder the name of your excellent bewtie.
And therfore, vndergoing it as yours, what difficultie could happen, which might not vanquish, to enternize your glories.
Ay me (strange Coriolano were assured thereof, what torment were so great, which should not account a pleasure and most swéete.
But oh cruell griefe, it is thou that hast conspired with my malignant starres, to make mee explaine my will before know how it will be accepted.
Excéedingly content rested I, séeing you at the Fountaine, and conceiued such delight, that therewith liue, and euer shall possesse this mancion of my life: but if you knew or would vnderstand, with what paines gréefes it was intermixed, there were no heart of Diamond, walled with Adamant, but would pittie my distresse.
She there ended, raining downe her christall rubie chéekes, such a shewer of liquid pearle, as it expressed her soules sorrow.
It was not vnconsidered by the Brittaine youth, for he was M. of Loues schoole.
thousand times cursed he himselfe, complaining against the blinde guidresse of vnhappinesse, reuoluing many inconueniences, the least whereof were woorse then death: for if he yéeld to the Ladies will, hee sées the wrong he offers to his Lyriana, and if he do it not, hee feares she is resolued for aye to kéepe him there.
Both things hee ponderated wisely in his minde, yet could not chuse which he might do, or how to excuse himselfe.
Notwithstanding of these euils hee tooke the lesse, yet greatest, chusing rather to suffer a liuing death, then to offend his deare Lyriana: and so hee aunswered contrarie to her expectation thus.
cannot but confesse (most excellent Princesse) how much you desire to fauor me, altogither immeritable of your benefits, and if ending the aduenture in your name, may be thought any seruice, for euer bee it happie for bringing me to this estate, wherein if my woorthlesse life sacrificed to confirme your content, may be any signe of thankfulnesse, behold me here readie to yéeld it.
Woe be to thée vnfortunate Eufronisa, since in thy tendrest years thou haste begunne to feele the bitter chaunges of inconstant Fortune.
Sure, sure am, shall remaine an example to all posterities through this vnséemly act, made woorse by thy vnciuill vsage.
do not require you cruell knight, nor will not haue you hazard your life in now daungers of new enterprises, onely request, séeing loue, (oh Gods that should say so) you would do the like.
Most faire of fairest Ladies (replied the afflicted youth) am yours, and as such a one dispose of me, for none with more will shall procure your content.
But yet doe not bestow your sacred faithfull loue on so meane a knight as I, both in conditions, blood, and estate, the which neither your Princely honour, fame, nor dignitie, doth allow, nor my selfe, séeing and knowing your loosing choise, bound by deserts vnto your worthinesse may permit, without infringing the constant lawes of faith, hospitallitie, and thankfulnesse.
The which rather then will commit, these my hands will staine with my owne blood: for where there is such inequallitie of deserts, should be hated and abhorred of all men, so to accomplish your languishing desire, and therefore haue patience (beauteous Princesse) for there is nothing better then it, to tollerate these hastie accidents in Loue.
Oh inhumane crueltie (said the wéeping Ladie) how much doest thou extend thy power against me? what auailes it thée, hard hearted knight, to procure my honour, by giuing me a most vntimely death? So shalt thou rather be called an homecide, then a man seruitor of Ladies: wel, well wot, that my ouer liberall giuing thée my heart, mooues thée to this strangenesse, knowing there is no reason in that breft wher Loue commaundeth: which were it in me, could not but see the increase of my honour by being silent: but with such vehemencie was my paine augmented, as could no longer conceale it.
And if thou knowest what it is to loue, this canst thou not iudge straunge, when true affection could neuer yet be limitted, and mine excéeding all others, forceth me to say: onely liue to loue thée.
Héere she pawsed, vnable to procéede further, nor the Prince to replie, the one intercepted by the gréefe the poore soule indured: and the other, to sée he caused it by being so obstinate and vnrelenting to her requests.
In the greatest confusion of the world was the Prince in, to sée the Lady, so determined and amorous, and he himselfe be reaft of possibilitie to helpe her.
hope most beauteous Eufronisa (saide the Gréeke) this conceiued anger against mee will bee pacified, knowing how long since, and afore this time, Tyrant Loue had made mée his tributarie vassall, delighting from mine infancie with those that were toucht with this euill, and if the consideration hereof may mooue you knowing my weaknesse, to satisfie your desire, hope you will desist from making your selfe guiltie of dishonour.
Ayme (cruell knight answered she) now Ile not so much complaine of thy disdaine, as of my owne lightnesse, séeing what a capitall and hainous crime haue therby committed, not onely gainst me, (yet that is no matter) but against all Ladies in the world besides, that onely for the name deserue to bee sued and intreated.
But (ay mee, that I) as ill accounting of that name, as of my pure honour, haue yéelded to Loues triumph: rather become a suter, then reserue my selfe to bee sued vnto.
And yet doo not you thinke, but perceiue your minde is still busied, imagining on an others absence, this and many other things knowe by experience, since first and last sawe you at the fountaine.
do confesse it all, and also my reputations wracke, but a resolued mind in constancie, cannot leaue lo loue, nor will otherwise, though it treble my sorrowes eternally.
For this did intreat thy helpe, and for this requested thy good will.
But for all am denied all; wil till death persist in this my pure loue, and hope for no remedie, euermore co~plaining alike of my self, as of thy most inhumane barbarous cueltie.
And therwith flung out of the cha~ber, bathing her chéekes in water of her eyes.
Shee sent him by Selia some Iuncates of her owne making to refresh him with, for she knew he had eaten nothing all that day.
She intreated him to be answerable to the Princesse loue, though it were but fained, for according to the gréefe that hath possest her, doubt she will not liue till morning: and consider what by her death wil be imputed to you, when you shall bee called the murtherer of so faire a Lady.
would to God (gentle Damzel) said he, it were in my power to redresse the Princesse griefe: but you know, being heretofore sworne anothers, it is impossible should pleasure her, without committing the greatest fault that euer knight hath none.
wil no more importune you (said the damzell) for shuld think my selfe much iniuried with your disdaine: how much then a Princesse so faire and honourable.
That is it (replied the Gréeke) which hinders me: for should do what she requires, it were but to satisfie her will a+gainst mine, which were the greatest wrong that might bee done her, for hauing pawned my faith vnto another, cannot violate it to pleasure her.
The damzel returned to her Ladie, leauing the Prince the most perplexed in the world, séeing himselfe in place where he could not vse his valor.
Selia found the beauteous Eufronisa tumbling on her bed, drowned in teares.
What sayest thou my deare Selia (said she to her) to the tyrannie wherewith that cruel knight doth vse me? what meanes may vse? my selfe know it not, nor doo thinke there is any? and to desist to loue him, thou séest is impossible: for neither my affection will permit, nor am able to let it.
Shee spied neare her the Crownes shée had wonne, and with a sigh that séemed to end her life, said.
Oh glorious rewards to increase my harmes, you were the sole cause of my vnhappinesse.
Now that she thought the Gréeke to bee in bed, not able to bee quiet, shee went alone vnto his chamber, whose sight made the Prince offer quickly to rise, shee stayed him, saying.
Ile not haue thée vse me with any of these ceremonious courtesies, nor is my comming for them (thou cruellest knight that euer the heauens did create) but onely do come, not to intreat of thée what thou shouldest of thy selfe
procure, hadst thou thy perfect iudgement, saue to demand of thée two things, for with either of them shal receiue some comfort, and beléeue me, they bee not to thy preiudice, for were they, would not require them.
Most woorthie Princesse, nothing more desire of Fortune answered he) then to haue that occasion offered, wherein might indanger my life in your seruice, and would to God by loosing it, might cure your woes, then should you sée with what willingnesse would cast it on a squadron of deaths darts: therefore demaund (faire Ladie) what you will, for wil at the instant accomplish it, beeing with the conditions you propounded.
Without them (most cruell Knight said she) who durst require any thing of thee, séeing thy straungenesse and barbarous disdaine so extreame against me.
The first thing therefore that for me thou must do, is, to tell me who thou art, and the Ladies name to whom thou hast rendred that fréely will of thine? The second thing Ile demaund, this being knowne, for séeing must be disdained and forlorne, wil know whom loue, and for whom am not loued.
Your excellencie (sacred Princesse) so farre vrgeth this matter, that cannot thinke (replied Rosabell why you wil know the thing, that being knowne, am sure wil but augment your woes.
They cannot be greater then them haue alreadie (did she answere) and therefore you must not breake with me, vnlesse you wil be as disloyal, as cruel.
am content to do it (said he) though sure am of your hate when you know me, but that may giue some ease vnto your gréefes, will kéepe promise.
Know therefore (diuine Ladie) am Rosabel of Brittaine, son to the Gréeke Prince and his Princesse Oliuia, espoused vnto Lyriana Princesse of Nyquea, and he that in nothing wil take more felicitie, then to procure your content.
But will you not (excellent Princesse) force mee beeing so inraged, to breake that faith vowed on her hands to be true Louer.
And now may you sée what reason mooued me to bee so obdurate, finding that any remedie from me, can but dishonour you.
And is it possible knight (said she) that you are sonne to the famous knight of Cupid, whose woorthie déeds and loues haue with immortal fame filled all the world, Wel, had no other cause, but that you are sonne to such a father, it were sufficient to make mee loue you till death.
only intreat your leaue, being alone opprest with these extream passions, may disburthen my cares, by séeing the vnhappie Eufronisa is yours, for so shall receiue some rest.
Most soueraigne Ladie, Princesse of Sylepsia, you sée what litle power is in me, to graunt you that license, for hauing no interest in my selfe, cannot without her will graunt any such thing.
Then (saide shée) tell mée where she kéepes, for Ile send to her for it? So enuious hath fortune béene to my content, that yet that cannot say, not knowing it, because she rest her from my hands.
Well, well, (replied the Ladie, chopping her words in the middle, and drowning them with teares) because aske, sée it is impossible should knowe it, least might receiue some little comfort thereby.
And since the earth cannot affoord me any, the second thing that you for me must do, since you haue promised it, and vowed by the faith of a knight, is, that with this dagger you bereaue me of my despised life, séeing your sight gaue me so many deaths: do not denie it, for you haue promised it, and if you do, be sure Ile trauell through the world, proclaiming your disloyaltie.
And so she drew foorth a dagger from vnder her gowne, and with manly courage she put it in his hands, saying.
Through my breast hewe foorth a passage for my soule (most cruell knight) and yet will not haue you make the wound vpon my heart, least you should hurt your selfe, modelde in the middest thereof.
The Gréeke tooke it, so amazed, that he knew not where he was.
But the resolute Ladie immediately discouered her brests, the purest work that euer nature wroght.
Make an end thou of my libertie, to giue me som content by this expected death, and stain with blood this constant obiect of thine eyes.
Oh rare force of loue (faire Ladies) whose power consisting on extreames, makes all things else séeme madnesse, being compared to it.
Oh, who would not be mooued, séeing the Greeke holding the dagger in his hand, sitting on his bedde, yet ranging with his thoughts on Lyriana, and the Ladie vrging him to hasten the deadly stroke? Oh cruell inexecable knight (said shee) wilt thou yet in this torment me? make an end at once, with one swéete death to end the many suffer, Rosabell being the sole cause.
In not doing this (most Princelesse Ladie) neither commit disloyaltie (said the Prince) nor breake my word, for
So excéeding great was the gréef that suddainly surprised her, that stopping her breath, and benumming all her artires and vsuall powers, she fell on the Gréekes brests.
The greatest proofe of constancie was this, that euer knight was tried withall, and had hee continued it, no doubt but the example of it selfe had béene a sufficient memorating marble to record a déed so famous.
do not wonder if he beganne something to yéeld, and ioyne his face to hers, (fairer then Apollos halfe resolued to accomplish her request.
Ere he was fully determined, which wanted but little, shee recouered her selfe, and séeing she was so vsed, conceiued an vnhoped ioy, féeling the heate of his chéekes on hers, neuerthelesse with many sighes shee said.
How is it possible, tell me knight, thou shouldest still harbour such crueltie, as suffer me to languish in such paine, which thou mayest remedie by taking away the life abhorre? That thou wert cruel and inexorable, farre more then Hyrcanian beasts, poore haplesse Eufronisa knowes it long sithence by experience.
But that thou wantest loyaltie and faith to obserue thy word, who can beléeue it of so mightie a Prince? do confesse (faire Princesse) answered he, do offend my selfe not doing it, yet the offence is greater against both, and woorthily then deserue the title of a cruell homecide: but that you may not longer complaine of me, grant time till to morrow, to be resolued in those extreames, and then will reply to your content.
It pleaseth me (aunswered she) although one daies stay will feare kill me outright, with this vehement and cruell griefe.
But must suffer, being borne to doo it, and you disloyall and faithlesse knight, consider well what you determine, for séeing you haue denied me death, these hands shall be guiltie of it in your sight, when your preuention shall want spéede to stay my execution.
And thervpon she went away, where had shee stayed, and once againe vrged it, no longer then that instant had béen ynough to answere, for the Gréeke resembled his Grandfather in these affaires: he had alreadie pondred the Ladies beautie and her woorthes, in such sort, that some of her distilling teares mollifying his obdured heart with such tendernesse, that he forgot Lyriana.
Little did he striue with his thoughts how to be resolued, for ere she went away, was the haughtie Brittaine in minde agréed.
Accidents be these ordered by the blinde God, vnderstood of none but him, although the soule suffers them, and yet cannot he, nor will conceiue by whose appoyntment it happens: a iust reward for his disloyaltie, since nothing should haue béene able to make him erre against his deare Lyriana, that with such generositie receiued him for her es+powse, her Lord and husband.
The Ladie returned glad with the hope of her expected good to Selia, and tolde her euerie thing that happened.
With some content they entertained the expectation of her ioy.
By chance, and it was a happie chance, the Ladie tooke one of the crowns that she had wonne in the Tent, and set it on her head, it was that which Belisa gaue her, to comfort her in her distresse.
Hauing it on, she séemed farre more beautifull, and somewhat elder.
Selia was amazed, and plucking her by the arme, said.
Bee still (Madame) for sée the fairest aduenture in the world, for this Crowne hath power to disguise the face, and beléeue me, you are not like Eufronisa.
Peace foole (said the Ladie) it is but Loues deuise, and thy wittes conceits.
Then do not credit me (replied Selia but the euidence wherewith prooue it.
So she fetcht her a and setting it before her, said.
She could not but laugh, séeing her countenance altered, and betwéene them both they iarred, whether she so were fairest or not.
Then she remembred Belisas words in the Tent, that there she should finde remedie in her greatest necessitie.
They would no longer deferre the knowledge of so happie businesse: so hand in hand they went into a gallerie, called the Ladies Treasurie, because therein were the pictures of most in the world.
This was a curiositie the king for his pleasure had made.
Many they sawe most faire, and they were those that in Grecia then flourished: but passing further, they perceiued their deceit, finding Lyriana, whose beautie she possest.
They read the title, which tolde them she was Princesse of Nyquea, to the greatest ioy that euer Eufronisa did conceiue.
Oh my Selia, the heauens now will take my part, for knowe, the Lady that hath captiuated this knight, is she whom represent hauing on this Crowne: and by this deuise, meane (nothing thanking him) to fulfill my desire, although he haue promised me an answere to
And if can, with this deceit Ile craue no answere, séeing it must come with so many paines and grones.
And sée my Selia, how my suspition at the fountaine is verified, that he was not him hee said, for he is son vnto the famous knight of Cupid, and betrothed to this Princesse, and so thinke may stand excused for this my boldenesse.
Well knew she it, that in the inchanted Tent tolde me, that though therby should obtain greatest good, yet would it be intermixt with infinite troubles.
Ioyfully returned the two Ladies vnto their chamber, expecting the next morne, to deceiue him that was alreadie deceiued, repenting him of the disdaine hee shewed.
The newe crowned Ladie entred his lodging, to giue him the good time of the day.
The Gréeke had scarce séene her, when falling in the deceipt, he tooke her to bee Lyriana, and with great tendernesse he ran to her, saying.
May it be deare Ladie, that in time of such sorrow you would be pleased to glad my heart with your presence.
How ill should requite your loue deare Lord (saide the mistaken Ladie) if did not procure your content, being able as at this time, and though be with you, yet none knowes of it.
The Gréeke Louer embraced her, thinking he enioyed his Lyrianas companie, which made Eufronisa most glad to sée the effect of the pleasant deceit.
What happened by this méeting, is left to honest consideration.
Onely Galtenor saith, the Ladie forgot her paines, enioying many daies the fruition of the Gréeke Louers bedde vnder that deuise, telling him that a wise man her great friend, had for some time fetcht her out of the inchantment, to accompany him in that distresse.
Much bound did the Prince thinke himselfe to him for so good a turne.
So farre wrought the vertue of the Crowne, that all the time shee enioyed him by that deceit, the Gréeke could comprehend no more, but tooke what Fortune offered him.
At length Eufronisa iudging it reason to let him go, féeling her selfe with childe, conferred with Selia that approoued it.
Shee tooke off the Crown, kissing it a thousand times, for hauing enioyed by it her harts content.
She had no sooner set it by the other, when it was presently taken away, not knowing by whose hands.
Haue patience Ladie, for the heauens will haue it so, and till you knowe
the fruite that by this deceit shall rise, neuer looke to sée it more.
So soone as it was taken away, the Gréek thought all that he had past but a dreame, hauing scarce the remembrance thereof.
What time hée had so spent he knew not, but stayed for the Ladies comming to giue her his answere, which shee determined to refuse, because shee would not be bound vnto him for it.
How are you determined (most cruell knight of the Flowers that according to your resolution, she may liue that loues you.
am sure (excellent Princesse) you haue had time to consider the wrong you do me, to inforce me breake my word: yet am yours, and will bee till the death, and so may you dispose of mee at your pleasure.
Euer since (most glorious Prince of Greece that Fortune or the powers of Loue made my heart obedient to your will, onely procured but a graunt from your mouthe, by so many meanes as you haue séene, solely deuised to affect you, and that you might knowe loue you.
And since you are assured thereof, and now to comfort my sorrowes in your absence, wil haue you leaue with me some remembrance, and let it be your dagger, for which you shal haue mine, that wherewith intreated you to end my life, which now Ile kéepe to imploy it in your loue: and beléeue me (braue Prince) while this soule shal haue power to breath, this affection shall neuer decay.
And therewith, with excéeding ioy she embraced him, and taking his ponyard, she gaue him hers, bidding him prepare his departure against the next morning.
The Prince did so, somewhat abashed to haue béen so importuned.
Hee tooke his leaue of the Ladies not without many teares, for trust mee, hee was beloued in the highest degrée that euer knight was.
verie rich Iewell the Ladie gaue him at his departure.
All armed in precious armour, and mounted on a lustie Courser, giuen him by Eufronisa, hee went out of the famous Cittie of Golthuerge, whose departure she tooke most heauily: yet some comfort she conceiued to be big with childe by him.
Straight the two Ladies beganne to deuise how they might kéepe close Eufronisas trauell, who being a straunger to such matters, gréeued thereat.
Onely this consolation she tooke, to looke from the toppe of a high turret towards Grecia, whither her ioy was gone, calling it a heauie land to bring forth such fruite.
Thus this bewtious Lady passed away the season vntill her time of deliuerie, which being the first, she felt extreamely.
She was deliuered of two boyes, the fairest that the heauens created: for he which was first brought forth, had on the face of a Lady, fairer then the sunnes Splendor in his pride.
The other a heart thrust through with a dagger, with the wound so fresh as it séemed then to bléed.
Reioyce faire Princesse, with the issue sprung from that deceit, which is such, that it frées you from any fault.
Oh, may the powerfull heauens deare children of my heart, let you liue to know your warlike father: for though he vsed me with all crueltie, yet are you his sonnes.
Blesse you may the Gods, make you as happie as am vnhappie, although may now call my selfe the happiest on the earth, onely by being your mother.
So carefull Selia, tooke them away, and through a secret doore in the garden, she gaue them to the old ancient knight, to see them nursed in some Village.
At their carriage away, a thousand kisses and blessings did the louing mother giue them, as diuining the long time shee should be ere againe she saw them.
With much care did the olde knight carrie them to a Village, where he had prepared a nurse for them.
That hee might passe more couertly, he the Forrest, bearing the children in two baskets on a litle Asse, by the way hee rested, and tooke downe the boyes to quiet them from crying.
Scarce had he done, when a chased Lyon ran thitherward, being hunted by shéepheards, with their dogs.
The knights age and the Lyons sight, put him in such feare as he fell downe in a trance.
As then the cruel beast ment not to take any pray, but to escape his pursuers.
In this manner lay the old man and the children crying for hunger, when by great chaunce a mightie Lord dwelling on the confines of Sylepsia, past that way with his wife, that had bene at the Cittie to to sée the tryumphes there.
With them was an auncient Lady, lately deliuered of a childe, that dyed in Golthuerge.
So soone as the Lords wife saw the children, and hauing none her selfe, tooke such affection on the babes, séeing theyr woonderfull bewtie, that she commaunded the other Lady carefully to nurse and bring them vp.
In this manner were these two Infants carried by this Lord,
Who so grew in yeares and bewtie, that they were accounted children of the Godds.
Where we will leaue them, nourished by the good Knight Sergio, for so was hee called, omitting also their afflicted mothers sorrow for theyr losse: and a while must remember the mightie dispayring knight Claridiano of the Sphere, already departed from Croatia.
What aduenture the Prince Claridiano met in the Ile of Creet, where he disinchaunted his Vnckle Claramant.
FOr a while (faire Ladies) am constrained to leaue Loues amorous discourses, and trust mee, with some gréefe: but hauing to treate of many things, must describe them with diuers styles.
And now the warlike Gréeke, with an Adamantiue power, attrackts me to lighten him from the darke center of obliuion: who departing from the most bewteous Venus, and gallant Laysa, lanched into the Adriaticke sea, downe the which, hee Nauigated foure dayes: and the fift, hee crossed into the Affrican, and happening on no aduenture deseruing memorie, he put into the Carpachian and Egeum seas: where sayling some fiftéene dayes, his enchaunted Barke ran it selfe on land, in the Ile of Creete, (now Candy the happiest and fertilest in all those partes, because Ioue was borne and raigned there.
shore leaped he and Palisandro his Squire, and landed theyr horses.
The commonest way that they could iudge, they tooke, and did ride aboue an houre, méeting with none to learne in what land they were.
Vnder a high Pyne they dismounted to rest and passe the heate of the afternoone, eating of such prouision as Palisandro had carried from the Barke.
although it was such little comfort to the paines he suffered, that were it not for Palisandros consolations, hee had without doubt run into excessiue dangers.
As he sat downe, certaine shéepheards came that way, driuing their flocks to féed on the downes, belowe a hillocke neare to that place.
They told him, how he was in the famous Ile of Creet, of which hee had heard so many things.
It much pleased him, to heare the shéepheards name the aduenture of the thrée Pypes: for though hee had heard thereof, he neuer knew it to be in Creete: to bee assured thereof, he demanded of them thus.
Can you tell me discréete shéepheards, the beginning of this aduenture? who made it, and for whom? That which now is said thereof (Syr Knight) is, that not many yeares since, this aduenture appeared here, where (it is said) there is onely one of the famousest Princes of the world inchaunted: whose strength is also giuen out farre to excéede Theseus, so celebrated in this Ile, for killing of the Minotaure.
So difficult is the entrance to the Fountaine, called of the thrée Pypes, that none, though many mightie knights procured it, haue arriued thither.
Onely there is one entrance, so surely guarded, as it is thought impossible to passe that way by force of armes, all the rest is immured with so high a wall of stones, cut so smoothe, that there is no ascending nor entrance, but through the difficult passage, which is a little beneath your hill.
do greatly thanke you (kind shéepheards) for your courteous relation, and will requite it in any thing may.
So they went away, leauing him conferring with his squire about the proouing thereof, for he much desired to know the Prince that was within.
The squire would not gainsay it, knowing his valor sufficient for greater matters.
Then hauing a while rested, they followed the shéepheards direction, within a little time they came in sight of the stupendious Edefice.
Neuer before had the Prince séene a thing more worthy admiration then it: for it séemed to checke the most highest Clowdes.
The passage to it, was along a faire Valley, a stones cast in length, whose entrance was through a Lane of mightie trées, whose innumerable thicke branches ioyning togither, did well declare the difficult passage.
Without any feare Trebatios haughtie Nephew arriued thither, not far fro the Groue that leaded to the Fountaine, of which the aduenture tooke his name.
The breadth of the way that the Prince went, would suffer but sir knights to go it togither: the which, as one prepared to the fight, the mightie youth traced.
So comming to the end of the Lane where the Vallies entrance began, he was not so amazed with the battell he had against the hellish beast at Merlins sepulchre, as séeing here one of the fearefullest winged Serpents that might be.
He stayed himselfe, to bethinke him by what meanes hee might combat with the vgly monster.
In the end he resolued to be best on foote, the better to vse his nimblenesse and weapons, so did he dismount, giuing Palisandro his horse, and taking his Lance in his hand, and with his heart in heauen, he marched towards the infernall monster: the which séeing him come, stretched her self on the ground, and raising halfe her body, hissing fearfully, crept against the Gréeke, who with that discréetnesse he vsed in all his affaires, setling himselfe strongly on his left leg, hurled his Launce at her.
Vpon her inpenitrable scales wherewith she was armed, it fell, rebounding backe as if it had lighted vpon a Rocke.
Neuerthelesse, it made her bend her head as lowe as the ground.
With a nimble leape he got within the beasts Cabbin, where there began such hideous outcries, that he was about a thousand times to turne backe, but iudging it base cowardise, with his sword drawne he expected the serpents comming.
Neuer was that Ile witnesse of a more brauer Combat.
In it the Gréekes dexteritie auailes him, for the edge of his sword can make no impression in her.
He found it, when at his first assault, he gaue her a mightie blowe on the scales.
Whipping the earth with her taile, came the furious Serpent against the Gréeke youth: and being neare him, with her mouth he would haue hoysed him aloft: he defended himselfe stepping aside, so scaping her clawes, but not her taile, wherewith shee gaue him such ayerke, that she floong him farre without the entrance he had woon.
More furious then shee rysed the Gréeke Hercules bruised with the fall, and with hastie paces hee ranne againe vnto the entrance, but there hee founde the Serpent.
Fearelesse, the valiant Gréeke approached to her, holding his sword sure betwéene his hands.
He had scarce made an offer, when the diuellish furious Serpent snatcht at his shield with one of her fangs, dragging him thereby,
It gréeued not the Prince to be there, nor yet to haue lost his shield, but with his sword in both hands, stayed for her that furiously came flying to him; she stretcht forth her paw to take him with her sharpe clawes.
With much héed the Prince expected her, and being neare, with a flourish, he gaue her a most strong blowe.
It was venturous, and that which gaue him the victorie.
For discharging it very neare her breast, where the scales were not so hard, it mortally wounded her.
No hellish furie is now comparable to her being wounded, for striking the earth, she flew to the Gréeke, whose courage and strength could not now defend him from her tayle: for therewith she strook him to the ground, where also he could not scape her tallents.
His armor saued his life, though some of the ioynts ran into his flesh.
The Gréeke in this extremitie forgot not his dagger, which drawing forth with his left hand, he stabbed it thrise vnder her necke, with which wounds she let him go.
But she had no sooner done it, when she returned vpon him, opening wide her infernall mouth.
He strongly held his left arme, and holding the point of his dagger vpwards, he ran it into her mouth, whereon she thinking to pray, twixt her iawes, shee thrust it into her braines.
With some trouble the Gréeke drew it forth, glad of the good successe: yet before he got cleare, or that she fell, with her taile she gaue him the last yerke, in such manner, that had she bene able to second an other, he had bene in great daunger.
He fell on the ground, voiding much blood through his mouth.
The like to that the Gréeke Louer neuer had receiued.
He rose, because carelesly he would not loose what his valour assured.
And saw the serpent weltring in her owne goare, till by little and little she dyed, to the Gréekes excéeding content: who to rest, sate him downe vnder a loftie oake that grew in the end of that Lane, and tooke off his helme to take the ayre, that then freshly blew.
On the bark of the Oake he saw a scrowle, which he read thus.
To thee Knight, whom Fortune hath so fauoured, as ouercomming the feareful keeper of the entrance vnto the three Pyped Fountaine to let thee here arriue to rest, haue courage, for it must ende what yet doth want.
The words did not so much feare him, as the doubt whether hee should haue to do with knights on whom he might better shew his valour.
Long would not Archysiloras Louer rest, for presently rising he tooke his shéeld, and casting it at his backe, went downe the Valley.
Great comfort did hee receiue with the byrds swéete harmony that welcommed him, where Philomelas sad complaints increased his, and the Larkes swéete song (the mornings Herault) eased his trauell.
more pleasanter place the Prince had neuer séene, for besides the flowrie Tapestry, the diuersitie of all manner of frutefull trees were so many, and in such order placed, that Nature mistresse of inuention, séemed there to striue with Art (the adorner of her wants) for soueraigntie.
Euery thing the prince considered not, omitting the dear remembrance of his soules commandresse, fayre Archysilora.
He made such haste, that about the second houre after hee arriued to the famous Fountaine, whose proud making, much amazed him.
For the Pypes through which the water ran, were thrée mightie sauages, cut in Alablaster, whiter then the snowe (vppon the Appenines) all guilded and inamelled.
Vnder the thrée pypes was a faire great Cesterne, where she little byrdes flew to drinke.
The vnknowne Castle shall be seene by none, vntill the dispayring Lyon, freeing the passage to his owne bloods cost, shall arriue vnto this Piller: where to passe forward, he must leaue heere some peece of his Armor.
The Prince a good while doubted which it should be.
He hung it on the Piller, and straight went on, discouering before him the stately buildings, so high, that they séemed to reach vnto the middle region of the ayre, it was all so couered with Golde, that it scarce admitted any sight.
There was but one doore, the which the Prince found fast locked, whereat with the pummell of his sword he knocked very hard.
At the noyse, a window opened aboue the gate, out of which there looked a Lady all in Armor, sauing the head.
The sight astonished the Gréeke, thinking it was Archysilora, who with some anger, said.
What séeke you (audacious Knight) for none may enter here, but that liues to loue without hope? halfe trembling,
do confesse, how offend you (most excellent Quéene of Lyra by demanding a reward for my faith sacrificed to thy gallantnesse: but yet if with death or endlesse dishonor you will still be reuenged on me, appoint the manner of the vilest death you can, and will bee hee that shall most willingly performe that sacrifice.
It is well knight (replyed the Lady) now you haue committed a fault, you thinke by confession to extenuate your descrued punishment.
So ouercome with contemplation of his Lady stood the Gréeke, that he heard not the opening of the gate, with as much horror, as if a peale of ordinance were discharged.
Through it, came foorth two Knights richly armed: and also after them, followed the bewteous Claramant, apparelled in cloath of Golde, whose presence would haue made Narcissus leaue his to stay and dote on him.
Hauing their Launces in their rests, and as swift as the winde, they ran against the carelesse Prince, that was busied gazing on his beloued Archysilora.
So valiant were his two aduersaries, and so desirous to hit him, that they lost not their encou~ters, which were so mightie and sudden, that when he would haue warded them, hee found himselfe on the ground, so sore brused with the fall, that he could not rise when he would.
So eager is not an Eagle to defend he yoonglings, as the Knights turned vpon the Prince, and both at once againe hit him, but being warned by the former negligence, stoutly resisted them, that they could not ouerthrowe him, but made him stagger backwards.
So skilfull were the Knights of the Castle, that the one séeing the ill successe of their encounter, like a second Mars, flung his Lance at him.
He mist him: for in the middest of his amorous brest, hee gaue him the greatest blow that euer he receiued, and was forced to stay himself with his left hand on the ground.
Neuer before did the Prince iudge himselfe in more danger, séeing the knights so actiue and strong.
They could not so preuaile with their dexteritie, but the Gréeke with his, reached him that hurled his Lance, such a blow, that sencelesse hee strooke him on his horse necke.
Hee ran to plucke him down, but he was stayed in the attempt: for the other knowing hee could not come in time to rescue him, setled himselfe on his styrrops,
and out of his arme let his Lance flie, like a killing Comet: it strooke him on the one side of the closing of his armor, where Galtenor saith, it wounded him a litle: but Lirgandeo affirmeth, he was felled to the earth, yet howsoeuer he could not performe his attempt: for all he much procured it.
Now the two companions being spearelesse, drew foorth two swords vnequalled in all the world, and with them arriued vpon the Gréeke, that expected them: floorish discharged one vppon his helme, which he gréeuously felt, and the other somewhat lower thrust at him fiercely: which hee dearely did aby: for Claridiano more furious then thundering lightning, auoided it stepping aside, leauing him hanging vpon his horse.
Thinking to haue slaine him, with both hands he laid on his shoulders.
The Prince imagined he had cleft him in the middest, but he could not be vanquished on horsebacke: who therefore returned with more courage then before, and began to helpe one another against the Prince, with such strength and lightnesse, as he thoght himselfe in manifest danger, doubting the euent of the battell.
So one assaulted him with his Coursers swiftest course, which carreir he lost: for Archisiloras Louer a little yéelding sidewaies, cast his strong arms about him, and maugre all his forces, pulled him from his saddle to the ground, much glad therof, for so he might better deale with them.
Who were so instructed to aide one an other, that he which was on foot, wold neither loose nor step from Claridiano, till he saw his companion run at him, and then with a swinge hee turned him against the horse brest, who encountred him so strongly, that he made him stumble backwards like to fall.
And more to helpe him downe, he on foote thrust at him in his amaze, two such strong points, that Claridiano neuer did what he was now inforced vnto, for neither courage nor valoure preuayling, he fell downe.
But like Anteus towching on the earth, he rose fresher and fiercer, that he on horsbacke escaped not frée for his encounter: for as he turned, Claridiano as wrathfull as a hungrie Lyon, let driue at him with so puissant a blowe, that whether he would or no, hee felde him from his Saddle downe to the grassie plaine: where it added pleasure to content, séeing the fortunate and vnconquered Gréeke enter, and retire as he would.
Wearied he had them, although himselfe was no lesse: for they of the Castle were of the valiantest in the world, and about that matter, would not refuse Mars his challenge.
Crossing his sword inwards, the one assaulted the Gréeke, it was but an offer, for going toward it, he stayed his arme, and bearing it lower, strooke him on the legs, and on the left thigh he gaue him the greatest blow that he had receiued in all that battle: for though it did not wound him, yet it put him in such paine that he could not stir that legge.
The good effect of the stroke, perceiued they of the Castle, and that they might take the aduantage, before the paine left him, they began to hammer him with more strength and spéede, then the Cyclopes did when they forged Aeneas Armor.
The Prince much feared being so lame, but séeing it concerned him no lesse then his life, dragging that legge, performed wonders.
The first Battle that euer Claramant had séene was this: the which he iudged to himselfe would be the last, so fierce and terrible it was.
He said, more cunning skill nor vallour could not be wished in one knight, the~ what he in the yallow shewed.
It was a matter worthy the Prince, for as he was, he neuer suffered them to close within him, though they nothing else procured, stil kéeping them out with his vntollerable cruell blowes, which made them kisse the earth, sometimes with their hands, and then with their knées.
In the ende he flung at him that had wounded him: quicke he was, but Archysiloras Champion was possessed with extreamest of his rage, and therefore reached him on the toppe of his Helme, in such manner, that in despight of him, he tumbled him on the gréene brest of his mother earth.
At him with a thrust ranne the other, which Claridiano striking aside, hée strooke him with both handes on his armes, that he could no more vse his sword.
Hee closed with him, and hoysing him from the ground, flung him downe on his backe, neare where his Companion was.
Vppon them with his naked Dagger busseled the Louer: for hauing exceedingly incensed him, he forgot the pitie and accustomed clemency which he vsed towards his vanquished.
To ende a Combat with death (most valiant knight) whose conquest is so manifest, wil rather blemish the Victors victorie, then dignifie his fame: Wherefore pray you, giue me those Knights as by you are vanquished.
The haughtie Gréeke lifted vp his head to answere him, for through the anger of the fight, he had not noted the Donzell.
So looking on him now, he was astonished, thinking he sawe himselfe: for were hée a litle elder, none could haue distinguished them, nor yet from the Emperour Alphebo, for they resembled so much one another, that in the beginning he verily iudged him to be his father, which opinion his tender yeares frustrated.
And yet supposing him some kinsman of his, did graunt it, and would haue done had it bene farre more.
But that was inough, had he bene any other then Claridiano, to make him neuer returne to Greece.
For scarce had the Donzell raysed them with his hand, when as freshe as in the beginning, they let flie at him, togither two such blowes, that they made him knéele on the ground.
It extreamly gréeued him to be so mocked, yet was not he angry against the Donzell, imagining through lacke of iudgement he had done it.
He animated himselfe to this new Combat, although with some doubt to sée his aduersaries nimbler and lustier then at the first, and himself somewhat weary.
Clasping his sword strongly in his hand, he went against them, making them knowe, nothing could bereaue him of his assured victorie.
So closing with the one, with his shoulders he thrust him from him, like a loosened arrow from a bowe.
His spéed could not saue him, for the furious Greeke cut away halfe his helme, with part of his head.
This blow gladded him, resoluing to deny the Donzell any thing he should aske within that place.
By this arriued the other, but what auailes it, for the Greeke Mars giues no blowe which they féele not within their fleshe.
They had kinde Ladies in this second fight lost the vertue of the Inchantment, only helping themselues with their natural strength, which was very great.
And yet it preuailes not against him that was borne a Conqueror.
End this cruel warre would the Gréeke, calling himselfe coward to prolong it so long: And auoyding one of their blowes, he ran at him with the brauest thrust that in all his life he executed: for piercing shield, breast and backe, hée tumbled him dead at his féete, to Claramants great admiration.
The second incouraged himselfe for all he was alone and sore wounded, it was but a little lengthning of his life, to endure a more cruell death.
strooke at the top of his helme, yet not with the strength he might, but he yéelding backe his head, couered it with the shielde: whereat the Gréeke turning his arme, discharged it on his thighes so mightily, that almost he cut one cleane off.
Before he could setle himselfe, he ran vpon him, and with incredible haste (least Claramant should interrupt him) he reaft him of his life: himselfe remaining so wearie, that his legges could not then sustaine him.
All his life time he most estéemed this victorie, for it cost more labor, more blood, and more trouble, then any other of that quallitie.
He went towards the beauteous Donzell, elder then him by sixe yeares, but hauing suffered no cares, nor paines, nor loue passions, made him séeme yonger then his cousin: who tooke off his helme, discouering that Mars his countenance of his.
Either reioyced to sée the other, thinking they sawe one another in a glasse.
intreat you (faire Donzell) so the heauens make you happie in all attempts, to tell me the cause of your being within so defended a place, and also who you are? for considering how dearly your sight hath cost me, (although thinke it well bestowed) you are bound to tell me: whereto Claramant replied.
Of neither (sir knight) may resolue you, vnlesse receiue the order of Chiualrie, and in faith it not a little gréeues mee, that cannot herein satisfie you.
Such desire had the Gréeke to know him, as hée was determined to giue it him: but remembring how hee was before mocked, thus answered.
Nay sir, if your knowledge must cost so much, will not more wish it, for in not performing as yet your request, am sure do you some seruice.
Why then (said Claramant fare you well, for Ile returne vnto my Castle, and in faith, sorrie to bée denied in my first request euer made to any knight.
Go with me from hence (woorthie Donzell, returned the Gréeke) and you shall receiue it with such solemnitie, as is due vnto your person.
The gallant youth answered not, but in great haste returned to the Castle, where had hee entred, his cousin had not béene able to haue fetcht him thence, for béeing with armes, none of all his kinsmen did excell him.
But the wise Nabato knowing it concerned his sonne Don Eleno, with his charmes and exorcismes, clowded with mists and fogges all those shining buildings, so astonishing the Donzel, that thinking to enter the Castle, hée mist his way, and tooke it towardes the Fountaine of the thrée pypes, where being a drie, and hearing the waters running noyse, he dranke.
But hee had scant toucht it, when such horribible and hideous noyse was heard, that Claramant was halfe afraide.
The ende of that aduenture consisted on Claramants arriuing to the fount, to take downe the shield which his cousin had hung on the piller, on condition of his passage.
So all that mightie edefice vanished away, made by the great Magitian Lirgandeo, as the second part related, wherein hee had inchanted this valiant Prince, when he tooke him from the barbarous Scythians that belonged to Bramarant, who stole him from his mother in the woods of Grecia, as in the third booke of the first part is expressed.
Alone did the Gréeke finde himselfe in a broad field, and Palisandro by him with the horses.
So looking for the Donzel, he spied him in great haste entring into a thicke wood of trées, that stood in the valley.
He rose and went thither, at such time as Claramant onely with his shield, had thrust himselfe within, whose sight he quickly lost.
Accompany him hee would, but it was in vaine, for a strong contrarie winde blew him out, where he was forced to expect the successe of that aduenture reserued to the Donzel.
How Claramant entred into Theseus walke, where he wonne his armour: and what else happened.
WIthin the intricate groue (swéete Lady) wee left the Donzel Claramant, whose disinchauntment being excéedingly desired of euerie one, made mée (to please those desires) a breuiate the presedent combats, although Lyrgandeo doth not a little inlarge his discourse therin.
But my selfe wishing no lesse his inlargement, then any other, forced me to enter him with such breuitie, within the wood, wherein hauing lost himselfe, Trebatios sonne wandred thrée daies alone, onely with the Greekes shield.
This was that crooked intricable mancion, in whose contriuing, Dedalus at Minos petition, king of Greece, did shew the sharpnesse of his skill and witte, wherein the famous Minotaure was inclosed: whose originall sprung
from she beastly blinde loue of Pasiphae the Quéene, for the king béeing imployed in the Troyan warres, she with inhumane appetite lusted after a white bull, that was among her heards: and not knowing how to accomplish so foule a déede, shee recommended it to Dedalus: who with his wit, being the Oracle of his age, contriued an artificiall Cowe of wood, wherin he put the Queene, couered with the hyde of another which the Bull most followed, by which meanes she satisfied her lust, ingendring the Minotaure which the Poets faine: and yet Arsanio in the fourth of his Problemes, approoues with wonderfull arguments, the possibilitie of the act: and saith that at the time of the monsters birth, returned the king, who would not, althogh the Quéen died of the labour kil the beast, but rather commanded him to be kept in a place most difficult to come foorth, reseruing him there, for what hée further intended.
For making cruell warre vpon the Athenians, in reuenge of his sonne Androgeus death, whom they flew, hee compelled them in satisfaction thereof, yearely to send him seuen men, and as many maides, to be deuoured by the Minotaure.
Whose forme was both of man and Bull, and of proportionable bignesse.
For some few yeares lasted this cruell custome, vntill Theseus comming, whose strength was nothing inferior to Hercules, in so much, that some will haue him to be he.
Being young, he ayded Hercules against the Amazones, whom after they had conquered, he married their Quéenes sister.
He slew the Tyrant of Thebes, that would not burie his dead kinsmen.
And in the Marathonian fields hee slewe the wilde Bull that wasted all Attica.
This was hee that rauisht Helena the first time, whose tender age might then well acquit her of the error.
Hee descended into hell with Perithons, to steale Proserpyne, where he lost his friend.
This by lot was sent to Creete as food vnto the Minotaure.
But the beauteous Ariadne affecting the youth, gaue him a clue of thread, which should (after he had slaine the beast) lead him out.
He ingratefully requited both her loue and life good turne, leauing her alone in Niosia Ile, which act of vnthankfulnesse so gréeued the most wise Dedalus, that he inchanted him in the laborinth, in recompence of his ingratitude, suffering eternall paines yet to fewe, in respect of his deserts.
He more inlarged the mazed house, that his libertie might be more difficulter.
least it equalled that in Egypt, and far excelling king Porsenas which he builded in Italie for his sepulchre: which was so fearefull, that hee commaunded before he dyed, he should not being dead, be there left without company, and so euery yeare, many being put therein, were inforced finding no way out, to associate him in his death.
In this inextricable wood, did Dedalus place Theseus, where the Gréeke youth had lost himselfe, not knowing how, nor which way he had got in there.
It gréeued him not, for his inuincible heart incouraged him to greater matters.
The fourth day of his wandring through the wood, hee came vnto a faire walke, whose Couert of gréene Iuie, reaching from trée to trée on eyther side, was so thicke, that neither sun nor starre could penetrate it at no time, and therefore it was naturally most colde, besides that Dedalus with his skill had made it more, when there he left the ingratefull Thenian, with fréezing colde to extinguish the burning heate, wherewith he loued Phedra, forsaking her sister that had giuen him no lesse then his life, helping him to the bottome of the thréed, by which he issued out of the Laborinth.
So he indured excéeding torments, minding on nothing, saue that none shuld passe that way, fearing that some one woulde vanquish the Minotaure, that kept somewhat more within.
Scarce could the Gréeke Prince endure the coldnesse of the Lane, and but that he iudged it base feare, he had returned backe: yet encouraging himselfe, valiantly with his sheeld, he passed on forwards, till he met with the mightie Theseus, clad al in most rich greene armor, garnished of tawnie Lyons, beset with many rich and vnualuable stones.
foote stood the fierce Athenian, leauing against a mightie stéele with a sword girded at his side, looking with such a sterne aspect, as Mars had feared him.
But Trebatios sonne borne to maister him, vndauntedly stept to him with such courtesie, as he thought his person merited, saying.
Most valiant knight, would gladly finde a passage from a place so yrkesome as this, and if along this Lane be the way, intreate you suffer me fréely to passe.
With admiration of his gallant disposition, did Hercules companion thus reply.
Most willingly faire Donzell, would pleasure you in this, or any thing else, but my ingratitude bringing me hither, forceth mee to let none passe this way, onely to haue more company (being alone) to associate me.
And so may you séeke an other way, although beléeue there is none but this.
Why then (said our new Mars shall be constrained to procure it, and so rest nothing beholding to you for it.
Whereupon as if hée were better armed then the Athenian, well couering himselfe with his shéeld, paced towards him, who became more fiercer, then when he descended into the earthes blacke Center, séeing the boldnesse of the youth so yoong and armorlesse, presuming to win what onely was committed to his strength, in so many dangers and haughtie enterprises approoued.
He raised aloft his axe, thinking to haue cleft him in the middest.
But the gallant youth leaping aside, meant not onely to make him loose his blowe, but to close with him, hauing an eye vnto his sword, hoping that if he had it, to assure his victorie therewith.
At this time he mist of his intent, for Theseus was none of those that admitted any such brauados: but in the middest of the stroke, before his aduersarie could enter, he stayed the axe, discharging such a blowe on his shéeld, with the point, that he inforced him backe swifter then hee came, with greater paine on his brest, for the shéeld striking there, made him almost breathlesse.
He had not effected this blowe, when with the blade he offered an other.
He floorished it aboue his head so mightily, that had not the Gréeke fallen on his, he had bene cleane parted in two.
He saw himselfe within deathes clawes, for the very wind the weapon yéelded in his passage, was inough to strike downe an other lesse valianter then he.
He would not then ketch at his sword, because the other ouerwharted him in it, but rather with the nimble skill his tutors had taught him, séemed to stay a blowe, lifting his shéeld on high, the Athenian beléeuing that he would, and that therewith he should terminate that controuersie, well setled on his left leg, hee let fly at him a blowe.
It is credible, that hitting him with the axe, he had diuided not him alone, but the strongest Rocke.
He that should liberate the Scythian Lady, would not so trust to his shéeld: for as the axe descended, swifter then thought, he closed with him, thrusting himselfe vnder his armes, and with his, he astonished him with a blowe running his shéeld against his head, whereat the other for feare of giuing backe, resisted him with all his strength, and so ayding his left leg outwards, our new warrior met with the swords handle, the which without more adoo, he easily drew forth, whose blade yéelded such splendor as the Prince was amazed.
It was many years since ye Athenian had not séen his naked sword, which now viewing in his enemies power, there is no Lyon in fiercenesse comparable to him.
Néeds would the Gréeke youth trie his conquered weapon before he got from him, discharging it with all his strength on that side it hung.
His armor it cut not, for the world had none better, but it so tormented his legge and thigh, that he could not stand thereon.
Now shall thou know (knight) how much better it had béene for thée, to haue let me fréely passe, and kéepe thy weapons, then to bée without them, for they now shall make me way.
Why then stay (said hee) discourteous youth, and thou shalt sée whether the hauing of my sword can defend thée from Theseus wrath, at whose presence al Plutos kingdome trembled.
And so he strooke at him a most mightie blow.
He could not so defend it, but it fell vpon one side of his shield, cutting it away: and made him thrice turne about.
But suddainly he recouered, and firmed himselfe against his aduersarie, that with his axe poynt came against him.
He turned away and scapt it, discharging his sword vppon his helme.
It sounded like a bell, making a displeasant musicke chattering of his téeth.
Ere Theseus could recouer himselfe, he gaue him another, it was it which gaue him the victorie, by the passing with the poynt betwéene the closing of his armor.
Cutting his priuie coate of male, the sharpe blade entred vnto his flesh: had he not feared the axe, and a little forwarder thrust his arme, he had slaine the Athenian: yet it was the first time that the ingratefull Louer sawe his owne blood, whose sight added such furie to his furie, that now hee will not procéede like a skilfull knight, but let his blowes flie at randon, which put the youth in more daunger and aduised care to shunne them, assuring himselfe, that blow which tooke him full, would be his death: and therefore he behaued himselfe with such dexteritie, as his cousin had hee béene there, could haue done no more.
Oh it was a spectacle woorthie the Gréeke Theater, for the haughtie Athenian fiercer then when he slew the Tyrant Creon, procured to giue him but one blowe, the which with singuler agilitie the Gréeke shunned.
There is no Roe in swiftnesse like to him, for entring and retiring at his pleasure, sometimes hee wounded Theseus, and euerie time he tooke him ful with his famous sword, he made him tremble like
the toppe of a high proude pyne, shaken with the voyce of heauen.
Hée himselfe receiued some, but they were on his shield, the which in that daungerous battell saued his life.
They were in the end (swéet Mistresse) made of flesh blood, and must feele the excessiue paine and trouble, so at once without any word, they withdrew to breath: for although the Gréek was not wounded, yet his much labour had ouer much wearied him.
Against himselfe bitterly exclaimed the Athenian, séeing himselfe both matcht and wounded, by one knight without armor.
The Gréeke had no cause yet to complaine, for this was his first battell, yet he incouraged himselfe to end it to his glorie.
As he walked vp and downe, he past by an oake, whereon he read an inscription to this effect.
Dismay not, oh thou valiant Knight, that by thy valour haste arriued to vngratefull Theseus walke, but take courage, for vanguishing him, and winning his armor, thou doest arriue (this being thy first battell) vnto the highest top of honour, reseruing in thy power, the hopes of greatest ioyes.
Hauing read the letters, the Gréeke thought nothing what hée had before him, considering the promise redounding by the victorie.
No longer would he rest, for the desired end of the aduenture will not suffee him more to breath: and so couering himselfe with the remainder of his shield, and strongly gryping his sword in his hands, went against the Athenian, saying.
Come knight, let vs end our battell, for it is a shame it should so long last, being but betwéene two.
There is not any, but at his first semblance would haue trembled like an Aspen leafe: yet the haughtie youth fearelesse, confronted him.
His axe flourisht, the Athenian thinking to haue hit him with the blade.
But the gallant youth, whose strength excelled his, with his swoord strooke it away: within him hée stept, letting flie a mightie thrust at his breast, whose force made him fencelesse giue backe, drawing his battell axe after him.
Trebatios sonne followed him hard, and ere he could raise it from the ground, hée layde on the visor of his helme such a blowe, that he thought the firmament had fallen, so many starres he sawe about his eares.
So abashed to be so handled was Ariadnes reiecter, for euen as hee dragd his axe,
hee hoyst it aloft, that the Gréeke could not escape the blowe, nor shun a wound vpon his right side, and yet but little, for féeling the blade, he yéelded to the left side, and let it passe, and séeing his wisht occasion, presently closed with him.
The Athenian durst not let go the axe, for therein consisted his strength: whereby vnable to helpe himselfe as he would in this strife, surely Claramant wonne ground of him.
better wrasle could not almost be séene, for the Prince being vnarmed, and therefore nimbler, trippes, tangles, and vntangles his legges with more dexteritie: which his aduersarie could not do, although by méere strength he valiantly resisted.
The Gréeke offering to take the axe from him, snatcht at it, but too strong so easily to part from it, was the Athenians holde.
Oh, who would not wish to sée this braue contention, for ingrateful Theseus to defend it, fetches forces from his alreadie fainting mind, and the Gréeke to winne it, imployeth the vtmost of his valour.
Thus contending, they were almost at the end of the Alley, when Trebatios issue with a fine slight got the victorie.
For séeming to let go the axe, loosened a little his hold, and himselfe stepping something backe.
The Athenian did the like, thinking so to reassure his axe: but the Gréeke setling himselfe strongly on his legges, stept in, and on the suddaine wroong it out of his hands.
No sooner had he done it, but all that abhorred fréezing Alley, séemed on a light burning fire.
The thundrings, lightnings, and hideous shoutes, not a little amazed the Prince, and him that was without, no lesse, who not able to indure, imagining the haughtie Donzell to be in some daunger, entred through those intangling pathes.
By the Athenians loosing of his axe, the passage was frée, so farre as the Donzell was.
So he arriued when his inuincible Vncle gazed on the armor Theseus had left him vpon a table of Iaspar, wher there stood a Piller with an Epitaph.
He then quieted himselfe, séeing it was the knight that had disinchanted him.
They embraced with such loue, as if they knew the consanguinitie betwéene them.
Now may you (sir knight) said Claramant, séeing fortune hath giuen me armour and weapons, let me receiue the order of them at your hands.
In all things desire to satisfie your content, faire Donzell (replied the dispairing Prince) wishing it no lesse then mine.
But now rest a while, for we shall haue time ynough to doo it, for beléeue the winning of these armes, haue cost you no small trouble.
Some indéed it hath (said Clarament but beeing so well acquittanced with the enioying of your sight, and these rich armes, account it wel bestowed.
But let vs read this scrowle, for feare we haue more to do to get from this accursed place.
So hand in hand they went to the Piller, and read the discription thus.
When the two most fiercest Lyons shall meete in the valley of vngratefull Theseus, the one winning his armor, and receiuing the order of knighthood of him that gaue him his liberty, and vanguishing the Minotaure, then shall the inchantments of ancient Dedalus haue end.
It greatly reioyced Claridiano, to sée that he might safely giue him the order of Chiualrie.
And with one accord hee armed and knighted him at once.
They fitted him so well, as if of purpose they had béene forged for him.
Neuer had Archisiloras Louer séene a gallanter knight: somewhat bigger he was then his cousin, but not taller: wherefore the wisemen alwaies doubted whether was the valianter, for their particular battels one against the other, it could neuer be séene.
But rather on foote with the no knight could abide the strength of Claramant.
Fewe times carried he shield, the better to play with his are, and therefore was he surnamed the Cruel, for with it hee spilled more blood then the fierce Affrican.
With excéeding ioy did he gyrt his sword, embracing him with excéeding signes of loue.
They vowed such great amitie, that their knowledge of vncle and cousin, could not more augment it.
while they rested, that with more courage the new knight might prooue the aduenture of the Minotaure.
So much desired the late armed Prince, to sée the beast, as he rose, saying.
It is time (sir knight) to end this businesse, for being so surely backt, were the enterprise more difficult, the victorie is most certaine.
His cousin followed him, glad to sée his braue and gallant gate.
His are he carried on his shoulder, the best weapon that the world contained, and his sword by his side.
In this manner they paced towards a stately building that stood in middest of the field.
Narrow was the entrance to it, but within if had so many intricate waies, that they could not deuise where it might end.
Enter into it would the vallerous Claramaunt, recommending himselfe vnto the immortall Gods protection.
The like did Claridiano, committing him to his kéeping, that with a framed the whole heauens, earth, and vast seas.
With tender kindnesse the two kinsmen embraced each other, which done, the haughtie youth prepared to enter the inextricable house of Dedalus.
What within hapned him, and the battell fought with the monster, deserues a new Chapter.
How Claramant entred the laborinth of Creete, where he slewe the Minotaure, and the glorious end he gaue the aduenture.
Doubt not (gallant Ladies, beauties ornaments) but that neither the excellencies of your perfections, whose powerfull vertue can onely with the sight commaund the greatest heart, nor yet the tender pittie attending on your sexe, will not with timerous feare appall your gentle minds, reading these fierce accidents of sterne Mars.
And then hope you will not conceiue lesse pleasure with the bloodie battels wherein am intangled, then at Cupids amorous discourses.
But where they seem offensiue, passe them ouer, though loue haue ordained them, and yet respecting the cause, know you will not condemne the effect.
For although now you sée the Gréeke Prince busied with cruell warres, too soone he will be ledde where he shall confesse, there is no good where the little blind God doth not raigne, and this euen when ayded with nothing but his strength, hee shall set frée the faire Princesse of the Scythians, from her strong inchauntment.
But before that happens, attend, and you shall heare what him befell entring the blinde Laborinth.
His axe he carrid afore, and with vnremoouing steppes, hee entred the habitation, where he so often turned and returned, comming backe when as he thought himselfe to go forward, and crossing such at euery second pace, that when he iudged to be at the end, he found himselfe at the doore.
Sometime he heard, not without great amazement, the noyse of voyces crying: The rich armor thou haste wonne bolde knight, shall not auaile thée to get from our dwelling,
in recompence of thy presumption to disquiet vs: and then felt hée such mightie blowes, that often made him set his hands and knées vppon the ground: but considering how litle he had done by winning the armor, and how the other valiant knight expected him, so animated him to indure those huge strokes, which none but he could haue suffered.
Wearie and tired, he at last came where he sawe a little light, that issued fro~ a high cranny of the wal.
It gladded him, for by it, he found a way that brought him vnto a faire large yard, about whose wals were many pictures and stories so naturally drawne, that they somewhat eased his paine.
By them he vnderstood Pasiphaes beastly accesse vnto the Bull.
It so disliked him, that he turned away his eyes, being offended, not with the pictures, but with what it represented.
Hee sawe Theseus cladde in those armes he won of him, enter the Laborinth, with the thread tied to his arme, and at the doore the two beautifull sisters, that with feare did stay for him.
The cause was, they loued, and where that passion is, none can liue secure, fearing also the good it enioyeth.
little beyond, he sawe how ill repayed Ariadne was, being left to the mercie of the windes among wilde beasts.
To such pittie was he mooued towards the Ladie, that casting vp his eyes to heauen, he said.
Oh cruell knight, vnwoorthie the name of Theseus, imploying so ill those partes the heauens hath adorned thee with, but especially against a weake tender Ladie, whom if reason had béen thy guide, thou shouldest haue helped, although thy life were hazarded.
new battell (were it possible) would haue with thée vppon this, to make thée confesse thy crueltie and ingratitude.
He vowed to himselfe to helpe all Ladies, though hee indaungered his life: which he performed so well, that many vnder that name, onely durst trauell alone, and euerie one called him the knight of the Ladies.
His owne image sawe hee a little further, and his battell fought with Theseus, togither with those which Claridiano made about his libertie.
He reioyced to see the haughtie déeds of his new friend.
Being about to go to the other side of the yard, to view those pictures there, as he turned, he espied two knights all in armor comming towardes him, with their shields and swords readie for the fight.
Their gallant semblance and brauerie much pleased the Gréeke: beeing neare him, one said.
Thou haste béene much ouerséene (knight) not acknowledging Loues soueraigntie, to enter a place so prohibited, where be sure thou shalt be called to strickt accounts.
They stayed for no answere, but ere he could sway his axe about, they gaue him two mightie blowes, one on his shoulder, and the other on his helme.
Both he greatly felt, especially so cowardly to be assaulted.
With an Eagles swiftnes he got fro~ betwéen them, into the middest of the broad yard, the better to vse his daungerous axe.
He stretcht it out at length, awaiting for his aduersaries, that nothing fearing, followed him.
With the poynt he hit one, almost beheading him, for with the blade he sorely wounded his throate: hée drew backe his axe, and winding it about, layed on his shield, the which he strooke to the ground, and his Maister headlong at his féete.
His companion was not carelesse, but comming behind, gaue him so strong a blowe vppon his helme, that though he cut it not, yet hee bended it to his breast.
Like a furious Lyon turned the Gréeke against him, whom hée found so neare, that to hit him, he was faine to draw back his armes, and with a fierce incounter he ranne his shield through, and wounded him on the breast, making him stagger backwards, and to helpe him downe, hee raised his axe, and discharging it on the side of his helme, he cut away all that part, with a great peece of his inchaunted gorget.
He felled him at his féete, and was so eager to end with him, that hee forgot his other aduersarie, who assayling him at his backe, gaue him so fierce a blowe vpon his middle, that his companion executing ano, ther in the same place, they had almost felled him.
Neuer was Beare nor Tiger more fierce then now the Prince became against his enemies, raising aloft his axe.
He could not misse his blowe, for they were before him.
So with all his strength he hit one on the shoulders, the blowe was so mightie, that all the blade he hid within his breast, splitting his heart in two.
Scarce had he finished this, when he laide vppon his other enemie, who was so skilful, that ere the axe descended, he got vnder his armes, running at his breast with a thrust.
This blow much gréeued the Gréeke, for it stopt the passage of his breath: and hee seemed to awaite the axe: but for all the haste he made to ward the blowe, it first crowned him with death, for falling on his head, diuided in two, he sent him to accompany his friend.
The hideous noyse which hee heard in the next roome, would let him take no rest, but rather leaning on his axe, he stayed more warily to sée what it was.
When presently with admiration he was amazed, seeing the feareful Minotaure so vgly and deformed.
His face was like a mans, although farre bigger: his eyes glowed like a furnace of kindled fire.
On his large front hee had two mightie hornes, whose poynts were harder then any Diamond: his necke short and thicke.
So big and broad a breast he had, that the very fight witnessed his strength.
He was of a dunne colour, and went vpright as wel on his hinder legs, as on all foure.
In stead of clouen féete, hee had most sharpe clawes, with which there was no armor but he would rent.
In bignesse he was but as an ordinarie Bull, yet swifter then an Ounce, and so with his strength he assured his light incounters.
With such fiercenesse hee came, that the Prince thought he should want time to view him.
Neuerthelesse, he fixed his foote strongly on the paued yard, vntil approaching to execute his blowe, hee gaue him way, letting him passe swifter then the winde.
There wanted no spectacles to the battel, for the windowes ouer the yarde were full of beauteous Ladies, among whom, (had he but his right iudgement) he might haue séene the tamer of his heart: neither did their want gallant Knights to accompany them, for Dedalus had also prouided that, when he first made that inchantment in reuenge of Ariadnes wrong.
The spéedie returne of the lustful Quéenes sonnes returne, put him from his gazing: but hee found the Prince so watchful, that his hastie course was to no effect.
Thrée carriers past they thus, neither wounding the other, yet so wel could not the Prince defend himselfe, but at last the Bul met with him.
He strooke him not ful with both hornes, for so he had indaungered him, saue with one, hitting him on the shoulder, which forced him to shewe more signes to be a tumbler, then a skilfull Knight.
He was so abashed to be so vsed, that fiercer then any Tiger hee stayed his returne: which hee did with his accustomed lightnesse.
Him did the warlike Gréeke expect with his axe on high, till he approached so neare, that to his thinking he could not loose his blow: with all his strength he turned it, giuing the furious Minotaure such a blowe betwéene his hornes, that he made him giue backe.
He thrust the blade so much forth, that the blow was but with the staffe, which sounded as if it had fallen on a plate of stéele.
With his pawes the beast catched at the Prince, who with a leape escaped him, swaying about his dangerous weapon, discharged it on his fore knée, whose hard hyde could not saue it from cutting cleane off.
Neuer on the earth was heard more fearefull bellowing then the Bull made, wounded so dangerously.
Somewhat carelesse stood the youth, thinking on the venturous blowe he had made, that he was forced to receiue one nothing inferior to his: for the beast suddenly ran at him with both his hornes.
To the fine temper of his brestplate, is Claramants life imputed: for had it bene otherwise, from side to side hee had pierced him: but finding a stay, so fiercely to resist him, he was strooke with a sore fall on the paued ground.
There, hauing his other foote to helpe him with, he had surely slaine him.
Neuerthelesse, with his right pawe (which was that was left) he tooke hold of his shoulder, and wroong him so hard, that ye Prince thought that part, to be crushed to péeces.
He drew it to himselfe, bringing away all it catcht in his enchaunted clawes, which was his vanbrace.
So strongly he hoysed the Gréeke, that he set him on his féete.
Some feare conceiued the haughtie youth, at the beastly creatures fiercenesse.
He was not able to vse his axe, before ye Minotaure holding down his head, tooke him betwéen his hornes, and floong him excéeding high into the emptie ayre: falling so miserably on the stones vpon his left arme, that he thought it and his body all brused.
Here Galtenor dares not vndertake certainly to expresse the rage that possessed the Gréeke Prince.
The hardest Dyamond would he haue cleft: so fierce he turned vpon Pasiphaes sonne, that like lightning came against him, againe to hoyst him on his hornes: but before he approached to execute his furious encounter, Trebatios sonne discharged such a blowe on one of his hornes, that it and part of his head came to the ground, and from wound issued gutters of gore blood.
Shrill shoutes of hideous cryes ecchoed throghout the edifice, answering the Bulles roaring.
Who closed with the Gréeke, casting his clawes vpon his sword hills, the which he drew forth, laying such a blowe vpon his helme, that with hands and knées he kissed the earth.
He feared not so much his combat against Theseus, being without armour, then now séeing his weapon in his enemies hand.
Increased so was his feare, hearing a clamourous noyse that saide.
Dead art thou distressed Prince, for neuer shalt thou sée thy desired Parents, nor thy new friend that expects thée.
It was no time to make reply to those words, nor séeke for them that spake them: for the diuellish beast fenst with the sword so brauely and quicke, that he constrained the Gréeke to vse all his possible care to shun his blowes by his dexteritie.
And the Bulles bleeding, was to his no small auaile, for with his turning it fell on his eyes, that it much blinded his sight.
So wel could not Alphebos brother saue himselfe, but he was ouertane with a mightie blowe, sidelong it lighted on his necke péece, cutting most part therof: and had the stroke bene giuen aduisedly, his necke from his shoulders he had sundred.
The beast euer so closed with the Prince, that he could not fetch about with his axe, that taking it by the toppe, he could no more but strike him with the point, yet all ye blade with the strength of his armes he hid within his brest, and thrust him away all the length of his axe, that he could not hit him with his sword, being out of his reach.
There is no poysonous Basseliske to be compared with the wrathful who casting flouds of blood from his eye and brest, prosecuted his disordered battle so cruelly, that the vexed Gréek breathlesse, and tyred with ouermuch labor, knewe not which way to turne himselfe.
And for all he sawe the Monster deadly wounded, yet he misdoubted the victorie, because he neuer reached him with the sharpe slising sword, but it made him set his knées to the earth.
All the yard was dyed with beastly bloodie gore, and such abundance therof he had shed, that he séemed nothing so fierce as in the beginning.
Well did Claramant perceiue it, which infused new hopes in his fainting minde.
thousand times called he himself coward, séeing that battle so long continued, which he iudged his friend would haue had long afore ended, if he were in his place.
Most circumspectly, and with the greatest care he could, he awayted, and it was not in vaine towards the ending of the cruell fight: for the fierce beast returning with his full carreir, he strooke him on the head: in two he cleft it, and felde him dead at his féete.
He was no sooner downe, but all that edefice was couered ouer with thicke blacke fogge.
appeared to the Prince, that had he not bene Claramant, there he had for euer left his life.
The horror which the Castle and all the Inchauntment made in the vanishing, strooke him in a traunce on the ground, and was no lesse, then if heauen and earth should haue met with fierce incounters.
An houre and more lasted the tempestuous noyse, in the end wherof, the skies cleared, and Claramant found himself neare to the Fountaine of the thrée Pipes, from whence Claridiano ranne to imbrace him, and ioyfull to sée him safe, said taking off his Helme.
How doo you féele your selfe (most valiant Knight?) for am sure, considering the outragious cries heard, you haue not bene idle.
haue vndergone all things easily (sir Knight) replied his vncle, only by hoping of your sight, which hath lessened all my troubles if any be sustained.
So sitting downe at the Fountaine, he related to him all his successes, wherat his cousin remained no lesse amazed then content, iudging ye knight to be the sonne of vallour, of whome Claridiano intreated he might know who he was.
Were it for nothing else (Sir Knight replied Claramant but to satisfie your content, should haue thought my selfe most happie, if Fortune would haue let me tell you who am: But hauing so fauoured me with your deare sight and acquaintance, no maruel if this pleasure so sauour of some discontent, as in not being able to reueale my parentage to you, because indéed knowe not who am, more then that haue some yeares bene nourished in this Groue, being made excéeding much of, yet not knowing by whom, nor for what cause, it is incredible.
Sometimes to comfort me in my solitarinesse, they told me was of Greece, and of Noble parents.
There is no ioy comparable to Claridianos, hearing he was a Gréeke, perswading himselfe certainly he was his kinsman.
Againe he imbraced him, gratulating his being of that Countrey, and his Countrey man.
Claramant requested also to know him, since the friendship vowed betwéene them, might allow no secret from the other.
The kissing of his hands intreated his faire vncle, saying.
The not knowing you (soueraigne Prince) hath made me commit so manifest an error: wherefore in signe of inpenetrated pardon, graunt me your victorious hands, that may thereon expiate the offering of my innocency on them, due
Most valiant Knight, this is not tollerable, yours being of such deserts, meriting the dutie of all the world: And trust me, you are too blame to vse me with such ceremonies, that am your professed friend, and wil be til the death.
All that day they rested there, in pleasant conuersation passing away the time, where Palisandro reioyced in his very soule, that his Lord had found so mightie a friend.
So many things did the Prince discourse to him of Grecia, which so contented Claramant, that he intreated him to returne and accompany him thither: The which Archisiloras Louer graunted, purposing to discouer himselfe to none, arriued in Crecia, and so he praied his vncle.
In the afternoone, the two Heroicke warriors tooke their way towards the Sea.
At their departure from the Fountaine, on the Piller that contained the former words, they reade these.
The intricate Laborinth and vanquishment of Theseus, the most ingratefullest of all Louers, was ended by the mightie Kinght of the Lyons, in presence of his greatest friend and kinsman: by whom he first receiued his libertie.
And so both ended the famousest aduenture in the world.
The suspitious words to be neare Allies, could not more augment the Louers amitie betwéene the two haughtie youthes, although they increased new ioy, hoping in the end that Prophecie would issue true.
Thus they arriued at the sea shore, where they founde their inchaunted Barke richly prouided with all necessaries for the Gréeke Princes.
Who being shipt therein, with more fury then doth a Commet crosse the azure skies, it launched into the déepe.
Where of force we must leaue them, returning to Greece.
How Lysarte King of Tharsis, and his sonne Florisarte, Prince of Argentaria, arriued with their Fleete within sight of the Maruellous Tower, and what else happened.
ALthough am constrained altogither vnwillingly to leaue treating of Loue and Loues discourses, yet wil not leaue to implore your fauours (bewteous Ladies) to march vnder the displayed Ensigne of sterne and bloodie Mars.
For if it he wel considered, this is an amorous warre, procéeding of affection, wherein the chéefest and valiantest thereof, imparts no blowe vpon their enemies, but is guided by Cupid.
Some fight here to please their Ladies, others, to giue her libertie inclosed in the Tower, whose loue many prosecuted, but only by one is obtained.
And others to become Louers, choose this warre as their best meanes for it, which indéed sorted not in vaine, because many sacrificed their liberties to vnknowne Ladies, especially in Greece, where the blinde God kept the greatest part of his treasure, wherewith he captiuates the strongest hearts.
So that (diuine Ladies) while follow Mars his Drumme, doo not forget the footing of Cupids daunces.
And this opinion is wel confirmed by the gallant Florisarte, Prince of Argentaria, who neither Armes, nor the being among so many bloods, could extinguish the remembrance of his Loue, not knowing who it was, saue only to maintaine his word, ingaged to disguised Artinio, that for Arbolindas sake, the faire Princesse of Scotland had so laide that plot, heretofore recited: whose memorie and absence, made him within his Helme drowne his eyes in teares.
It is common (excellent Ladies) among amourous Gallants, alwaies to bewaile their greatest euil, although many other present daungers doo incompasse them.
In this perplexitie the valiant youth in his fathers company, with all his Fléete nauigated the Gréeke sea with prosperous winde.
With such great desire came the Argentarians, and men of Tharsis to fight, that they thought they should neuer sée the occasion to shew their kings
Ten dayes they sayled on the Vast seas, méeting with nothing that might hinder their voyage, bearing the Gréeke armes in middest of their Cullours.
The eleuenth day early in the morne, they discryed a mightie.
Nauie of ships and Gallies, houering vp and downe, vpon the calme waters.
So not knowing what they were, nor of whose part, they strook alarm, séeing the great aduantage they had ouer them, both in winde, and lightnesse of vesselles.
The Fléete of the Tharsian Prince, in good order began to cast about in manner of a halfe Moone, discharging two péeces of ordinance, in signe of battle, setting forwards against their aduersaries.
Who as it séemed trusting to their strength of multitudes, made ready their well furnished ships, and answered the~ in like manner, aduancing on their Admirall, their royall armes: and thus they approached one an other, séeming to couer the seas.
Foure of the Agentarian Gallies rowed forth without, spread sayles to discouer their aduersaries ensignes, which to their content they discried: for being in sight of them, they saw the imperiall Eagle, with two crowned heads, the selfesame they had.
In signe of peace and message, the Tharsians hung out a white flagge.
So they were suffered to passe among their ships, whose numbers of men and fierce Gyants amazed them.
They boorded the Admirall, from whence two ancient Knights of Argentaria, were in a Barge, conducted to the royall Galleon, where they deliuered their embassage vnto a mightie knight, that little wanted of a Gyants heigth, telling him how in their fléete were the kings of Tharsis, and Argentaria, from whom hauing séene their armes, they came to know whether they were on the part of Grecia, vnder whose standard they also fought.
These newes excéedingly gladded the gallant youth, being no lesse then valiant Abstrusio: who would néeds expresse his thankfulnesse for what Rosabell had done for him, hauing through his valour and strength obtained his faire Syrinda: who knowing that her Abstrusio went to Grecia, would not stay without him, dreading the want of his presence.
And so to conduct her with more safetie, hee had mustered togither from both kingdomes and all the Ilands he had conquered by his valour,
thousand Combattants, the skilfullest in Nauigation in all the wide world besides, and he himselfe excelling all others therein, because with aduantage to giue a battell on the seas, hée seemed to haue bene onely borne thereto: hee brought with him
puissant giants his friends, yt to please him with many of their knights, accompanied him in that voyage.
And in his ship to guard his deare lady, were twentie, proportioned like to plesse pynes.
Now séeing the Nauie, he had reputed to be against him, came on the of his honoured Prince, he declared who he was, and how he reioyced to haue met such friends vnto the Gréekes and Rosabell.
Presently they sounded in signe of peace, yet many of Abstrusios followers, and Argentarians, gréeued thereat, because they first desired to haue made tryall of theyr persons: but long was it not after, that they had occasion to do it.
By this was it knowne to Lysart, who his reputed enemie was, and so to shew him extraordinarie courtesie, he and his sonne with foe Lords of estimation went to visit him, whereof Abstrusio being aduertised, expected their comming on the hatches of his Galleon, commanding as they passed by, they should be welcommed with a generall peale of Ordinance from all his ships: which was performed in such good sort, that the haughtie Lysart much commended their good entertainment: who with all his company went of the Galleon: and most kindly the two lustie warriers embraced one an other.
And so being knowne how they were all voyagers for one enterprise, and eyther relating how much they were bound to Rosabell, the mightie Abstrusio burst forth into these words.
Oh Ioue, now am fully assured, how effectually thou dost impart thy fauours to the Gréekes: and nothing wonder at the lamentable desolation of ruined Troy, since al the good aduentures of the world are soly reserued for the~, as due to their worths.
And your Maiestie hath reason mightie king of Tharsis, to shewe the office of a friend vnto so braue a Prince, and as for me, were not he am, shuld denie what owe, since through him enioy my life, possesse my kingdome, and that which is more, and most estéeme, is the happie fruition of my deare wife.
And then he told him all yt hapned with him, to Rosabels immortall glory.
So Lysarte requited his discourse with an other of his Loues, and that therefore hee brought that Nauy to ayde them.
It is no more then due (said Abstrusio to helpe him that helpes so many to obtaine their ioyes, in whose pursute let vs spend our liues, to make him happie in content.
And so ioyning both fléetes togither by the Tharsians direction, they set forwards, for Lysarte was best acquainted with those seas, and knew where the enchauntment stood, hauing bene at it when he freed Rosabell from it.
to honor the Pagan with more then ordinarie courtesie, commanded to be proclaimed throughout his Fléete, that euery one should obey the mightie Abstrusio, as their Captaine Generall.
Since our amitie must be of such force and continuance, wold not (mightie Prince) you wold vse these ceremonies with me.
do, but what know you deserue and is your due.
Braue Prince (replyed Lysarte and therefore do but commaund, and we will all obey: for now and at all times, we entend to be your souldiers, and so hée intreated him to passe into his Galley· but not able to obtaine it, hee and his sonne were faine to stay in that Galleon.
With the noise of many instruments, the two puissant Nauies began to shape their course towards Nyquea.
They had such faire weather and prosperous winde, that on the fourth day of their Nauigation, they discried the flames of fire that issued from the Tower.
Thither they turned their course, sending forth sixe swift sayling Gallies, to discouer their way.
The which were so neare the Tower, that they sawe a most daungerous battell fought betwéene the Arches.
The reason was, for that the mightie Brauorant making his abode there, would suffer none to prooue the ascending vp.
Some about it had lost their liues, and many their honors.
They so long tarried, that from the South they discried before they went away, such an infinit number of sayles, that it amazed their iudgements, déeming them to be aboue
Neuer did Xerses sée at once so many sayles togither.
This fléete was the mightie Soldans of Nyquea, with whom all his friends beeing ioyned, came thitherward couering all the sea of Greece.
In the Admirall, was the two Soldanes of Nyquea and Egypt, being a brother of his whom Rosabell slew.
Who séeing himselfe so mightie, resolued with all his strength to reuenge his brothers death, and his was the greatest part of that power.
With them ioyned the Prince of Syconia, Venus Louer, the Sophy, the mightie King of Assyria, with the Phenician: who hoping there to sée their sonnes, as Lupercio tolde them, agreed to ayde the Souldan of Nyquea.
Also very strongly came braue Epirabio, with proude Brufaldoro, Brauonts great enemie.
Many men brought not Bembo Prince of Achaya, but without doubt, the valiantest and most expert in warre.
Enuious Lupersio so well pleaded for this braue knight, that he caused him to be created Lord Generall both by sea and land, hee accepted the honor, iudging his stre~gth to be sufficient to discharge a greater charge.
He named for his Lieftenant and Substitute by sea, the discreet king of Assyria, because he had rather fight by Land, that he might order and dispose of the Shippes and gallies, least their numbers breaking into disorder, might hazard their victorie, which otherwise they had assured.
Euery one highly estéemed him, séeing his gallant behauiour, and knowing how he was honoured throughout the world.
So many hundred thousands of men they brought, that he thought he was able with them to subdue all the world: For most of the Princes were accompanied with furious Giants, and many Sagitaries: especially the Soldane of Egypt, because his country affoorded most.
With such noyse they arriued at the Tower, as if heauen and earth had met.
Yet for all this, did not the two Combattants desist from the cruell sight, vntill the strange knight saw how great a Fléete made thitherward, and then thinking it no wit, longer to stay, with a cruel point thrust ye sturdie Brauorant from him, and turning his barke, put foorth into the sea, leauing the inraged Pagan so furious, that hee was about to follow him.
Hée was nothing daunted with the sight of so huge a Nauie, but rather wished they would assault him, that hee might execute on them the wrath that the knight had put him in, who was none other, but the bewtious Archysilora, who séeing the flames, came to the Tower.
Within sight she stood, and so did the sixe Gallies, to sée what order they tooke.
With soueraigne prayses did Lupersio extoll the merits of the Knight of the Tower, so euery one called him.
They all reioyced knowing whose sonne he was, and how he would take their part.
He aduertised his friend Bembo, to honour him: for in him consisted the sure hopes of that doubtfull victorie.
The Prince did so, sending a Galley to salute him in his name.
little did not the Pagan estéeme the account that was made of him, much honoured Bembo, being acquainted with him.
By Lupercios counsell the thrée most mightie Pagans, Bembo, Brauorant, and Brufaldoro, his competitor, placed themselues before the Arches, for he red what after did insue: and there (had it not beene in respect of Bembo would Brauorant haue had assaulted the Mauritanian.
There was neuer a Prince in all the Fléet, but went to know him, all whom he receiued with singular courtesie.
But how he tendred Floraliza, requires a new storie: hers was the third voyce in counsel of war, for that dignitie had Lupercio procured her, by whose direction all the armie was gouerned.
Neuerthelesse, greatly sorrowed the Soldane of Nyquea for his sonnes absence, thinking his presence would haue assured his hopes.
Scarce had that mightie Nauie cast about the Tower, when another no lesse puissant then it, appeared Eastward fro~ the coast of Grecia, the which but stripping the windes, purposed to get the aduantage of his enemies.
It was the Emperour Trebatios, that with fiue hundreth shippes and galleyes made towards the highst part of the Tower: somewhat a farre off, and from the toppes of their masts they could descrie the Fléete at the Tower, which they iudged to be their enemies.
Neuer did Neptune on the seas behold a thing more stupendious, for both armies seemed two populous Citties.
In the royall Admiral, all the Princes were met to consult on the giuing of the battel.
The Emperor brought with him the best men in all his Empire, and in his guard his sonne Rosicler, the warlike Rosamond, with famous Brandafidel, and the stout Bramidoro king of Cerdena~.
For the Ladie perswading her selfe that in so renowmed an enterprise, her beloued Dacian would surely be, would not stay in Grecia; but rather clad in her rich armour, was one that wonne most honour both on sea and land.
With him also came the sonnes of the mightie Croanto, Lord of the Carmenian Iles, knights, whose like the world contained fewe.
No lesse guarded was the Emperor Alphebos Admiral, within which there was besides himselfe, his deare Empresse Teffereo, and the two valiant Spanish brothers: for his more safetie, he had with him twelue Gyants his neighbours, then who in all the aduerse armie, there was none valianter, nor that with more trust and care defended their Prince.
The Spanish Admirall was one of the brauest and best furnisht shippe in eithers Fleet, for therein would Torismundo shewe his magnifisence, with his brother in lawe Clauerindo, and both their sonnes that were in her, and at their guard fiftie Spanish knights, that against Mars, neither of them would refuse the combat.
The new King of Thessaly, would néeds manifest how much he was bound vnto the Greekes, to whom with his Sarmatia, the first onset was committed, and to be seconded by the Spanish and French, as me~ most hardiest at the first assaults.
The Emperor Trebatio like a wise Captaine, shewed himselfe in sanguine coloured armor (for this deuice pleased him best) and mounted the hatches of his ship, that euery one might sée him.
With him came the two wise men, Lyrgandeo who as yet knew not the end of the aduenture, for it was in Medeas bookes, and he that had them, was their friend Nabato, that in a Cloude houered ouer the Tower (for his deare Don Elenos sake) least Lupercio with his exercismes might deuise some newe treason against the Lady enchaunted there.
The counsell was ended, with resolution straight to begin the battel, although there wanted the Kings of Antioch, Babylon and Persia, whose presence was greatly missed.
Euery Prince and commaunder passed to his owne ship, to order theyr necessarie affaires.
And while the quiet waues with gentle calme hore their vesselles, the great Emperour of Greece leaped into a Frigat, wtth his Helme off: on the one side went his sonne Rosicler, and on the other, Don Elenos faire Lady, and hauing gone round about his Nauy, encouraging his souldiers, set himselfe in middest of them all, and thus began.
Come is the time (most valiant knights) wherein déeds will be more requiset then words, hauing such multitudes of strong enemies to cope withall: if be mooued to speake thus, beléeue me, it is but to renew the memorie of the royall blood from whence we descend, the glory ye our predecessors fro~ age to age haue maintained, eternizing their fames therby, to all posterities: intreating you as friends, that none would fight otherwise, then to make their enemies confesse the worth of their persons, not for desire of spoyle or gaine, and to expresse his duty, loue fidelitie towards his God, Prince and country: for this, nothing but this, will assure his victorie.
And let not their ouermatching numbers daunt our couragious mindes, but still vphold our woonted valor, wherewith in despite of foes, we made our names to be feared.
There can be no greater honor, then with glory here like good knights to die, if sates haue so appointed.
And since euery one of you knowes the right and iustice of our cause, let vs confidently trusting thereto, make them know how vniustly they haue turned the world.
Here ended the braue Emperour, and with amiable Maiestie, commaunded his frigate to his former place, leauing his souldiers so animated with his words, that they thought euery minute long, till they met with their enemies.
Straight he ordered his battels, diuiding his Fléete into thrée parts.
The middle most he himselfe conducted, being all the Gréekes and Macedones, whose Generall was Meridian.
The right squadron guided the Emperour Alphebo, with all those of his Empire, being very warlike people.
The left going somewhat foremost, ledde Torismundo, Prince of Spaine.
Before than all went Priams valiant heire, backt with some Spanish Galleyes, to succour those in most daunger.
On the Pagans side, in no lesse good order had Bembo disposed his battel, in forme of a halfe Moone, an vsual custome to fight among them: in which manner they approached our Nauie, at the sound of many thousand militarie Instruments.
Beeing readie to giue the ot, the famous Generall from this Admiral, spake thus.
Where (valiant Knights) there is so many Princes, and such great experience in warre, should haue little néed to aduertise you, that Fortune hath ministred vnto vs occasion, foreuer to perpetuate our fame.
Sure may we account the victorie, for beeing as valiant as our aduersaries, we excéed them in numbers, and may if me list, two or thrée at once assayle euery one of his enemies.
As for my selfe, loosing my life in the office you haue giuen me, satisfie the dutie of a knight, and vow to be your generall friend till death.
And therevppon displayed a bloodie fla~gge crossebarde with blacke, a signe that none should take his foe prisoner, but shut the doores against all mercie.
So closing his beauer, lead after him the best soldiers in the Fléets, and leaning vnder the arches the mightie Brauorant, and Brusaldoro his competitor, those two puissant Fléetes began to come within shot one of another.
Where, oh Apollo, who may without thy helpe relate such a famous conflict? whose successe well deseruing a new Booke, it cannot haue lesse then another Chapter.
How the most cruell fight betweene both the Nauies began: and the admirable successes that in the processe thereof happened.
THis is the time, béeing incompassed with so many enemies, that dare not (faire diuine Ladie) passe one foote further without your speciall fauor.
Blacke and fatall was the day to many, tasting in it the sower cup of death.
But to those whom fortune was bent to please, reseruing their liues to sée the dismall bloodie losse of others, some comfort was it to them, the hearing of so many drummes and trumpets eccho in the ayre, resounding in the déepe, reioycing a so many displayed flagges and bannerets as daunced with the winds, the waighing of anchors, and hoysting vp of sayles, the noyse which the poore slaues haue on the waters, beating them with their oares: the clamorous cries of euery Captaine, incouraging those whom feare had alreadie daunted: the glistring shine of armour, and the confounding numbers of braue Knights and fierce Gyants, that on the hatches of euerie vessell did expect their enemies: these and such like sights, amazed and admired the beholders.
Neptune would not this day shew himselfe cruell, nor Eolus let foorth more then one gentle breath, that did with swelling pride blowe big the Pagans sayles.
Who taking aduantage of the good occasion, with redoubled courage offered to grapple, accounting the conquest theirs.
Oh who is he, able to describe the manner of so many deaths that there were giuen? So great was the smoke issuing from their shottes, that they neither heard nor sawe one another, which being past, and the welking clearing ouer head.
Oh Mercury, would thou wert in middest of this battell, in apt eloquence to modell foorth the merits of euery particular woorth.
But first the hideous cries of slaughtered bodies, the noyse of warriours, the shrikes of the wounded, could not but be a cruell spectacle: for they were all betwéene two of the cruellest oppressed elements that were, fire and water.
Quickly fomed the seas with bloodie froth, and on it floated the dead carkasses of sometime liuing creatures.
Excéeding great was the slaughter that the Christians made, with wilde fire and balles of burning pitch and rozen.
And as they vsed all possible celeritie in casting it, and the winde that played with their running wings a little strong, by that meanes was the destruction, which they made infinit: for neither striking of sayles, remoouing cabbins, and casting ouerboord all necessarie tackle, auayled to auoyde the mercilesse deuouring fire, which left neither mast nor sayle vnconsumed.
Oh cruell Soldan of Nyquea, that doest delight to sée the thing that would haue moued Nero to some pittie.
Straunge waies for deathes were there séene, for some flying the fire, perished in the waters: nor is there a friend, that will helpe the other.
The father in such hurlebourly knowes not his deare sonne, nor he remembers his sire to pay him the debt he owes him, for life and nurture.
Only euery one procures to liue, and when he cannot scape, to die, not to depart vnreuenged.
This satisfaction was the sole comfort to them, that with cruell wounds flung at their enemies, and stumbling on their owne guttes, embraced a willing death, togither with their aduersaries.
Some ha~ging by their strong hands ouerboord, sawe the cruell axe descend, and cut them from his holde, and he reioyced with such a death, rather then to be hewen in péeces by an Infidel.
Others embraced like good friends, sought their endes in the lowest déepes, glad to kill, being killed.
The proper life is heere had but in equall estimation with his aduersaries death.
Others that to themselues complained towards the heauens, against Fortune and their happes, sawe their friends come stumbling without armes and legges vppon them.
Such was the confusion among them, that no order could be obserued, although therin the Greek got some aduantage, because their vessels were lighter and better prouided.
The gallant Spanish Captaine with aduise of his Lieftenant generall, Countie of Medyna, appointed some small boates well furnished, who with all necessarie diligence, closely pearced through tenne of the Pagans greatest ships, the which with such furie leaked, that on the suddaine, not knowing which way they were suncke, with an infinit number of men, chéefely Gyants, whose waights did soonest ouerwhelme them.
Then preuailed not outcries of Pilots, nor the hastie calling for boats, because the Rowers fearing the fires which the Spaniards hurled, rather striued to saue themselues, then their friends, whom they sawe smothered in those vnquenchable flames, and beeing vp to the chin in water, yet séemed to burne aliue.
Peace, they iudged the two contrarie elements had made, séeing the aboundance of water could not frée them from the fire, nor the fire for feare of it, kéepe the waters from ouerwhelming them.
From side to side some were thrust, and these exclaimed not for beeing wounded, but for want of company to comfort them, in their funerall obsequies.
Well do the Gréekes defend themselues, offending on this side, where the Spaniards brauely cried S. Iames.
And although they were confronted thrée to one, they gallantly stucke to it, seeing how victoriously the Thessalians had assayled their enemies.
Wonders performed the Troyan with his beloued Sarmatia, against the Pagan: but what auuales it, when for one they kil, there came twentie in his place, and so on either side the battell was at one stay: whose fiercenes may be forgot, remembring what on the right wing was done, where the fierce Alphebo which Claridiana commanded, for no deuise can there be distinguished, being all died in one sanguine hiew.
There all other meanes they did forget of fight, saue with their armes, that being come to handie blowes, who would not, but with more then admiration admire, séeing them boord the Shippe, wherein the two Soldans of Egypt and Nyquea were, walled about with so many furious Gyants.
On his right hand went his Empresse Claridiana, like lightning among them.
But the gallant Teffereo, expressing there who hee was, shewed by good experience the high valor of his person.
beséech your Maiestie to follow me, for in despight of our foes, will enter this ship (said he.)
Do so, for we will all back you (replied the two Louers) that no lesse wisht it then he.
So the Ladie desirous to be first, couragiously leapt into the aduerse vessel, and maugre all the Gyants that defended it, she rusht in among them: but it had like to haue cost her life, for the Gyants iudging her to be of estimation, two of them gaue her two such blowes at once, that carelesse they strooke her at their féete.
Outright had they slaine her, or at least taken her prisoner, if her
inuincible husband with his vtmost spéed had not followed her close, almost falling downe, with such strength he leapt among them.
Many blowes he suffered, making no reckning of them, because he onely aymed at them that strooke his Empresse.
It is no new matter what hée now doth, diuiding the two Gyants at two blowes in foure parts, that had offended him, offending his Ladie.
He durst not go from her till she recouered her selfe, becomming fiercer then a mountaine Lyonesse.
Brauely were they backt by Teffereo, and the two Spaniards following them, togither with most of the Imperiall guard, and the foure Gyants, all which kept still togither in a round, backe to backe.
There was so many in the Soldans shippe to kéepe them at worke, that they had no time to looke about: for the Barkes and Galleyes of supplie, which Bembo as a skilfull Generall had appoynted for their purpose, serued to no other end but to fetch away wounded men, leauing fresh souldiers for them, and of the best.
Heere were one of the fiercest conflicts that happened all that day: for the Tribizonians imitating the valour of their Princes, would not haue them loose what they had wonne.
And therefore although thousands perished, they brauely hindered their aduersaries from succour, which was no helpe for the Lords within.
In her inchaunted Barke, had the braue Quéene of Lyra ranged about all the battell, to finde out her friend Rosamonde, whom shée greatly affected: but not méeting with her, her good fortune, or theirs that were in the shippe, conducted her thither.
Séeing that cruell fight, and thinking them to bee the Emperour Trebatios his Sonnes, shee brauely leapt into the Egyptian Barke, crying: Grecia and Lyra.
Many knew her by the voyce, among whom were the Emperours that were opposed against a number of Gyants.
More destruction make not the vnseasonable showers of drowning waters, beating downe the ripened corne: nor with more furie flies not the hastie fired powder, then the warlike Matrone with her sword, shewes her selfe ioyning with the Gréeke.
the first Gyant she met so brauely on the helme, that cleauing it, shee also cleft his head downe to the necke.
With such helpe (soueraigne Quéene said Alpheo our victorie will not bee so great, if this shippe should of it selfe yéeld, although the greatest personages of all the fléete be in it.
It was no time to bée spent in answering courtesies, for the Gyants bée many and strong, and die willingly in defence of their shippe, that by this was at the last to be conquered: for with the Quéens helpe, and the Trebezonians diligence, the two Soldans were constrained, rather then to fall in the hands of such fierce warriours, to leape into a Pinnace, in whose succors many others came, among which, was the Galeon wherein he came from Nyquea, into which they went, gréeuing for the losse of the other, which was one of the best in all the Fléet.
Whereof neuer a man suruide, but euery one perished by the sword, and they that fled that death, leaping into the sea, swallowed it in water of eternall sléepe.
This victorie was not so clearely wonne, but they lost tenne gallies of Trebizound, which the Pagans suncke, who also kept them company with some of theirs.
Leauing the conquered vessel well manned, and displaying on the toppe thereof the armes of Greece, victoriously they returned into their owne, and with all spéed the Emperour commaunded the Pilot to hale towards the Tower, where there was most to do, for the two braue Competitors being there, would suffer none to come thither without losse of life.
Wée haue no reason thus long to forget the mightie Bembo, Lord generall of the Pagan armie, who espying the Gréeke Admirall, supposing that most of her Princes were in her, made with his against it.
The noyse of the vehement shocke was such, that it séemed no lesse then the incounter of two huge rockes.
The Gréekes got the best, by reason she bore her beake higher, wherewith she brused all that side.
Here do they fight as if they were on maine land, for Galley to Galley, and ship to shippe, beeing grappled togither, the arme must onely procure the victorie.
Oh Bembo, who would not wish to sée the busied in the things thou didst neuer exercise? For firmly fixing thy féete on the ships side, with thy sword twixt both ha~ds, executed blowes ye Mars wold haue thoght
impossible, but as in the other, there were such knights, his déeds did nothing amaze them, neither Don Celindos, nor his braue sisters, who were confronted with the haughtie Emperour Trebatio, his sonne Rosider with the bewteous Rosamonde, that with victorious courage did behaue her selfe, giuing no stroke but it felde an enemie into the déepe, that séeing they must die, had rather doo it by her hands, deuoured or consumed, either in the water, or with fire.
She eagerly pursued Don Celindo, and followed him more then she should: for the Achayan séeing her so neare him, discharged a flourish on the best helme in both Nauies.
It made the blood gush through her mouth, and bende her head as lowe as her faire breast.
Shée conceiued such mortall hate against him for this blowe, that first the generall Gréeke warres ended, before it was extinguished.
Neuerthelesse he scaped not vnpaide, for trusting to her Armes, (although Floraliza gaue her a fierce thrust,) she lost not her intended blowe, which she executed on the Pagans shield: which is no defence against it, for the blade is the best on all the earth: and therefore cleane in two it parted his shield, in whose making, Lupercio had showne such skil.
It daunted the Sarazen Prince, for hée had neuer séene his Armor cut.
Yet there staied not the furious sword, for lighting vpon one side of his Helme, cutting, it descended downe to the shoulder, where it lost his force, making him stagger backe.
And then she would haue leapt into her aduersaries shippe, had not then come against her, the Gyants of his guard, that made her violently retire.
Idle were not Father and Sonne, behauing themselues there like Sampson, among the Phylistines.
And on the other side, the two friends, Bramidoro of Cerdenia, and the strong Brandafidel, with his flying vnaccustomed weapon, who sometimes, with it, at one blow felde thrée of those deformed Gyant.
On the other side, was this ship likewise boorded, by the valiant Prince of Assiria, so fiercely, that had not the good Theban Duke bene neare to her, shée had bene entered: but his comming, with the Duke of Medynas, intercepted their aduersaries from their purpose.
Ashamed was Bembo to be so repulsed, not knowing his aduersary.
Some paide dearly for his anger, for returning to his place, he met with Oliuias Louer, something carelesse of him, being carefully busied against the Gyants.
The Pagans armes were not of such weaknesse, as that his blowes should be receiued without warde, for it forced him to set his handes on the hatches of his shippes, and before he rose or were succoured, the Achayan seconded another, nothing inferior to the former.
There is no Hyrcanian Tyger that may be compared vnto the great Emperour, séeing his sonne so vsed.
He clasped his sword strongly twixt his hands, laying the waight therof vpon his helme.
Neuer til then, did the Sarazen féele such a blowe, for his sword flue out of his handes, and he set both knées on the hatches.
At his rising, a pellet of Brandifidels weapon, did hit him on the breast, and depriuing him of breath, made him recoyle backe.
Well did the two brothers knowe him, but they could not deny their dutie vnto their Generall: and therefore togither they requited the Gyant with such blowes, that stumbling backwards, he had like to haue fallen: and had they bene able to reach his head, they had felde him: for fewe armes were like to theirs.
With such eager fury did Rosamond séeke Bembo, that shée did not respect the others strokes, whom Brandafidell wel befriended with his terrible Mace: for with it, he strooke aside the two brothers, that brauely defended their partie: so that the wrathfull Ladie past along, and with both hands gaue the Sarazen Louer a mightie blowe.
All the toppe of his helme with a great péece thereof, she strooke away, and wounding him a little, she made him tremble like an Aspen leafe.
Ere the Pagan could turne himselfe, putting forth her arme, she gaue him a daungerous thrust on the breast.
His Armor and priuie coate it pearst: and Lyrgandeo saith, his flesh felt the blade.
But howsoeuer hée gaue backe yéelding from the sword, a manifest token that hée feared the poynt.
So well could not Bramidoro, and Brandafidels blowes defend her, but Floraliza founde opportunitie to giue her one with Camillas sword about her helme, with all her strength.
Shée greatly felt this stroke, for it made her turne amazedly about.
With another full as great, seconded Celindo, with Quéene Iulias cutting blade: it fell on her shield, whose inchauntment being far auncienter then that of his sword, it could not cut it, but it strooke it so violently against her head, that shée was verie much astonished.
Forward stept Bramidoro King of Cerdena, to pay what Rosamond
did owe (for the furious Bembo not séeing him, and méeting with a Gyant in his place) with both handes he gaue him so terrible a blowe, that he constrained him to set both knées on the ground.
So busied were father and sonne against the Achayan, and another, that he had time to bestowe another at his helme, it was with such mightinesse, and discharged (as he could not more desire) that he felde him all along vppon the hatches, to the astonishment of euery one that sawe the Battle, to enioy whose sight, many left their sights, for of foure to foure, a fiercer Combat could not lightly be wished.
Readie to burst with rage was Rosicler now, séeing the Achayan was onely he that disturbed the entrance of that vessell.
He closed with him, and with both hands they either discharged vppon the other, such puissant blowes, whose eccho was heard ouer all the fléete, the which, both Nauies horror could not drowne.
With much courtesie they receiued one another, bowing their heades verie lowe.
So inraged was the Pagan séeing his shielde in péeces, and his head wounded, that it made him second an other before Rosicler was readie.
It was like one of those he vsed to execute, making him touch the hatches with hands and knées.
He could not adde any more, but raising his sword, with it he reached Brandafidell (surprizing him vnawares) vppon his armes: It was a miracle he did not cut them off, yet it inforced him to let go his Mace, dragging it along, not able to wylde his armes through paine.
This did Trebatio well note, ending then the dispatching of a Gyant to hell.
At one steppe he confronted Bembo, whom before he could settle himselfe, the Gréeke gaue so strong a blowe, that maugre his might, he strooke him away from him: and saide to his friendes, that their pursuing particular Combats, made them loose the generall battell, their enemies so much excéeding them in numbers.
It was as the Emperour said, for indéed they had the worst, hauing euerie vessell of their owne assaulted by thrée and foure of their aduersaries, and yet the courage and vallour of the Christians was such, that it supplied the want of men.
All had not bene sufficient, had not at this time, some fiue houres before the setting of the Sunne, Eastward appeared at one instant, two proude Fléetes, that with a freshe gale made towardes the Battle, not séeming any whit to assault eache other.
And fro~ the coast of Niquea, was also descried a number of barks with souldiers.
Both Nauies feared, not knowing to which they would incline, for that side was sure of victorie, whose part they tooke.
At once they both approached, yet in different manner: for that which coasted more along the land, came altogither in one squadron, discharging their ordinance.
The other kept with the winde on the seas, and in forme of an Arch, with their greatest vesselles in the middest, lingring nothing behinde.
Whose arriuing, and what they were, deserues a new Chapter.
How in the Greekes ayde there arriued the mightie Abstrusio, and the King of Tharsis.
With Sacridoro, King of Antioch, Pollidolpho, and the Persian Prince.
THere is no content that might bee equalled to mine (fayrest of all fayres) if durst but imagine you had with some pleasure ouerpast the beginning of this Nauall conflict: the which fauour were soly sufficient to adde thereto such an ende, as euery worthy accident therein hapned did deserue.
For that Fléete which coasted more along the shore, entered among the Pagans side, that for all they were so many, were not able to forbid it, nor to breake their order.
This was the famous Abstrusios Nauie (then who vpon the seas was neuer any more skilfuller) and bringing with him, so many men well furnished vesselles, with an ifinit number of braue Knights, aduancing aloft the Gréeke armes, hee passed through his enemies with sayles, and oares, in mosthorrible manner: crying Grecia, and his countrey.
He kept such good order, that ere he lost it, he made mortall destruction on his enemies, for his smaller barkes entring, where greater could dot, did nought but cast wilde fire, melted pitch, and scalding Leade, which was present death to those that onely defended themselues with the sword.
Armed like Parthians, were Abstrusios followers with bowes and arrowes, wherewith before they fell to handy blowes, they bereft a number numberlesse, of liues.
Which horror of shafts being past, it was admirable to sée with what brauerie they betooke themselues to their weapons.
They were all expert and exercised in warre, because they liued in it continually, against theyr neigbouring Ilanders.
Wherefore the Sea began a newe to floate with dead trunckes of men, with such horrible outcries of the wounded, because they could not before death reuenge themselues, that there is no heart so stony and remorcelesse, but would haue bene mooued to pittie.
Sylla that wished to sée riuers of purple goare, had here bene satisfied with sight of seas of blood.
The mightie generall Abstrusio did set himselfe vpon the hatches of his galeon, doing what Mars durst not imagine: on either hand, Lysart did accompany him, with his sonne Florisart, desiring to make manifest their affection to the Gréeke.
The Gyants that were appointed to guarde the fayre Serynda, were cyzed like tall high mastes, clad all in steele, with Iron Maces in their hands.
better defended vessell was not in all that Fléete: for not dreading any thing, it went forwards sinking all it met.
The furious Bembo hauing séene the mercilesse destruction of his men and Gallies, had commaunded his to be vngrapled from the Gréeke Emperors, to send succour where it most néeded.
He was straight espied by Abstrusio, that presently sent those that followed him to boord her, leauing way for his encounter.
The beake of whose Galleon was all of Iron, fastened euen downe to her kéele, which made him presume on more then was lawfull on the seas.
So séeing how well his Gallies had assailed his aduersaries, not omitting his intent, Abstrusio entered with his, running with such force against the side of his aduersaries, that he split her cleane in two, and had almost endangered himselfe: for trusting to his strength, he would haue leaped into her when shee began to sinke, and they within her, cryed out for boates to saue themselues.
Oh Bembo, here diddest thou shew thy selfe to be whom thou art: for leaping into a small Barge, he opposed himselfe against Abstrusio, as if he were in as good a Galleon as his.
The Pagan laughed at his folly, and noting him more narrowly, by his colours he knew him to be his enemies Generall.
But the haughtie Louer that had his life reserued to endure greater troubles, made his valour there knowne to the vttermost, and how in déeds of
armes he would be second vnto none: for though he was beset on all parts, he so bestirred himselfe, that neither his aduerse Generall, nor Lysarte, with his sonnes power, could enforce him from his standing.
Presently was he succoured and taken into Lindauros Admirall, dyed in blood and so inraged, that he would speake to none, nor any durst looke on him.
To be in such vnaccustomed brunts amazed him, and more, not able to learne, nor gesse whom his aduersary was, that making such destruction of his, had succoured the Gréekes.
From this imagination was he put, hearing the entry of the other Fléete nothing inferior to the first.
Diuers were the voyces heard, for some cryed, Babylon and Persia, some Antioche, others Croatia, and all at once, Grecia, and then let flie such volleyes of shaftes, that no lesse hauocke they made, then Abstrusio.
Whose arriuall vtterly vanquished that wing of the Pagans: And Sacridoros Admirall where Oristoldo was, past close by the Tower, which none else had done.
It astonied both Father and Sonne, to looke vpon the two Competitors, Bramarant and Brufaldoro, who with their ponderous blades suffered none to approach the Arches: to doo the like arriued Bembo, making himselfe strong betwéene the Pillers that sustained the Tower, where he animated himselfe with gazing on the Ladie he most affected, that opening the Casements, then knowing none of them, had set her selfe to behold the battell.
She appeared like the Sunne of Maye, in all his glorie, chasing away the duskie Clouds from about him, that would obscure his brightnesse.
There was none in all the Fléetes but turned their eyes to gaze on her bewtie.
Many knew her, whereof one was Oristoldo, who thus said to his Father.
This is the season wherein we must procure to liberate you Ladies thence.
For the fayrest of them is Lyriana, whose carrying from Nyquea, cost our friend Rosabel and me so much blood, and more labor.
And beléeue me not (dread Lord and Father) if these knights haue not purposely take~ their standings there, that none might proue the ascending to the Tower.
As they were thus talking, they descried two knights of rare disposition, comming in seueral Barkes.
The one was presently knowne to be Don Eleno of Dacia, whome (being departed from Pollidolpho) Nabato had guided thither.
Pagans had then the worst: yet he entred as he was accustomed, couering the frothy waues with dead carkasses.
Quickly was Rosamond aduertised of his comming: whereat she straight commaunded her Royall Galley to waft her, where he was, she met him.
Her Armor was well knowne of euery one, and so her beloued Dacian also knew her.
He leapt into her Galley, imbracing one another with intyre loue.
It was no time for long discourses, so hauing kist the Emperors handes, the two Louers began to performe such déeds as were incredible, but not to those that to their cost beheld them.
The other knight clad all in Rose colour Armour, none as then knew: but approaching neare the Tower, and viewing his Lady, he conceiued such content, that he suspended his fight, til he had well noted the possessor of his heart.
He became so fierce with that sole sight, as he iudged nothing, the subduing of both Armies.
Casting his shield behind him, and taking Hectors sword twixt both hands, at fewe blowes he was known to be Rosabel, to the excéeding content of all his friends.
In this inchaunted Boate, he flung to the Arches of the Tower, but he found them so wel defenced, that neither his friend Aristoldos helpe, nor his owne strength, could make his way to them: For the thrée famous warriors being in a rancke, with such brauery behaued themselues, that euery one iudged the approching to the Pillers impossible.
With Brauorant closed Lyrianas Louer, crossing his sword on high: nimbler he was then Scythian, and so with all his strength before he could warde it, he discharged a furious blow on his helmet, the which had it not bene of such force, euen with his head it had bene cleft, yet he forst him two steppes backe.
Into his Barke he would haue leapt: but the Pagan (inured to such blowes, although it much gréeued him) returned, and with a thrust droue him backe againe, as fast as he came forward.
Fewe blowes like vnto these had the Britaine felt, but séeing the Ladies looked on him, and also his Father, and Graundsyer, that were come thither, returned vnto his place, where he began one of the fearcest Combats of all that day.
For against the other Barke wherein Bembo was, came Don Eleno, no lesse furious then Mars: and Brufaldoro was confronted by the Emperor Alphebo.
He ye first executed his blow, was hasty Dacian: so close grapled were ye barks, yt they could
fight as sure as on land, and therefore Rosamonds beloued, with Brutus sword, flourished it twise aloft.
Well perceiued Bembo his intent, wherefore leauing his Helme bare, gaue him a strong thrust on his amourous breast: the which taking him as he stifly stood, and with his minde another where, it was a great chaunce he ouerthrew him not, but made him stagger into his Barke.
After him would the Pagan leape, but as swift as a Leopard returned the Louer, and ere he could doo it, with both hands he discharged his sword, in such manner on his helme, that he thought he sawe more starres then the heauens contained: and bore so heauily on the one side, as he set his left knée vppon the ground.
Another seconded the Dacian a little lower, descending downe the shoulder: a better blowe was not giuen in all the Battle, for it cut away all his Vanbrace, with his sléeue of Male, and somewhat wounded him.
The Pagan trembled at the blowe, and knowing that was he which ouerthrew him in Grecia, he animated himselfe, for he was greatly vexed to sée his crosse fortune, and beganne to shewe, he was no lesse then Bembo, Prince of Achaya.
The Emperour Alphebo that knewe his enemy, warily assayled him, although he quickly broke off order, for the Moore remembring him, will not vse trickes of defence, but giue and receiue without pitie.
Both kist the ground: the Emperour with one hand, but the Mauritanian with both, and both knées.
The Gréeke seconded another, bearing his sword outwards: which offer he had scarce made, when turning his hand, with all his strength he thrust at his breast: thence the poynt glaunced to indaunger the Moore, more: for if he had not yéelded to the thrust, cleane through he had bin thrust, for happening twixt the buckles, it ranne to the other side.
None sawe the blowe, but iudged either the Moore to be dead, or deadly wounded.
Who hauing escaped that great daunger, became more furious then fire smothered within a Basseliske, charged with powder: And recouering his former place, casting his Shield at his backe, beganne so with blowes to weary the Lorde of Trebizond, that almost hée could not fetch his breath: yet not in such sort, but he often astonished the Moore, and made him to féele his strength and fury of his armes.
All this while was not Trebatios Nephew ydle, with Brauorant, the flower of Paganisme, for their fight is woorthie the sight of the towred Ladies.
It was more dangerous for the Moore, because the Louer supposed his Ladie had knowne him.
Many particular battels were left, onely to beholde that of the sixe.
Both are well armed and sure from beeing wounded, which made them fearelesse abide one anothers strokes.
Like a chafed Bore fomed the Scythian, séeing so many aduersaries to resist him, and more they that could hazard his battel, as he that then was before him, who refusing no labor, entred and retired at his pleasure.
Nimble and actiue was the Pagan, and so helping himselfe therewith, before the Brittaine youth could turne about, he executed a blowe vpon the rich helme which Eufronisa gaue him, whose fine temper saued his life, for else it had diuided him in two: yet it made him set his hands to the ground: ere hee rose, the Pagan discharged againe a flourish on him, nothing inferior to the other.
It was somewhat besides his head, and not able to make impression, it glanced away without more harm, although it had done ynough to inrage him.
With more furie issues not the Tyger from his denne to seeke his pray, then he returned vpon the Scythian with Hectors sword, strongly clasped in both hands.
Aboue foure lost the vermillion of their faces, seeing the feareful blow descend, whose noyse was heard ouer all the armies: his helme sounded like a bell, and he voyded much blood through his mouth and nostrels: and staggerd vp and downe, not knowing where he was.
With such another hee helped him, which forced him in amazement, to set his hands and knées on the hatches of his barke, wherein he would haue leapt, if the two brothers, Don Celindo and Floraliza, had not there arriued.
At once they both eagerly discharged two blowes on him, that hee was constrained to bow lower then he would Quicke and bolde was the Ladie, so would she haue wonne the entrance of his vessell, but shée had like to ouerthrowne her selfe: for the Emperors Admirall béeing neare thereto, and the haughtie Rosicler knowing his braue sonne, and séeing him so ill vsed, like an Eagle leapt into his boate, saying.
With the blowe he gaue, she was forced backe, and for feare of falling into the sea, shée withheld her selfe.
His son could not answere him, so inraged he was, imagining some shew of cowardise had made his father come to succor him.
And his blood repaired to his heart, the which burning like fire, and closing barke to barke, leauing his father with Don Celindo, he turned his reuenge wholly vpon the Ladie, whose beautie deserued no such requitall.
Camillas armie may she thanke for her life, else this had béene her last battell and terme of breathing.
Thrée steppes he made her stagger backewards, and followed her with so strong a thrust, that hee thrust her so farre within the barke, that easily he wonne the entrance in despight of the Pagans.
Excéeding danger doth Meridians daughter incurre, fighting with Rosabell, with whom no Lyon may bee compared.
Againe before the Ladie recouered her selfe, hee gaue her another that had almost felled her.
Neuer was she in such perill: but he that loued her as his soule, Don Clarisell, (that long had sought her) came thither in such good time, as it was worth no lesse then her life to her: who seeing his Ladie so handled, let flie a cruell thrust at him.
Against him that had strooke him, turned the Brittaine youth, giuing the Ladie leaue to rise and breathe.
Thither also arriued the furious forsaken Lindauro, with many mightie Gyants of his guard, and séeing the cruell fight, and knowing the Ladie (whom they all tendered) hee went against Rosicler, that hand to hand warred with Celindo: he entred betwéene them, parting both Barkes, whereby the brother and sister turned both vpon Rosabel.
He did not refuse them, although the Assyrian troubled him euerie time he reached him.
On euerie side else of the battell, the Gréekes had plainly got the victorie, which they brauely maintained.
And indéed the mightie Abstrusio was he that wonne it, winning the title of an excellent Captaine, which he kept for euer.
There wanted not them that tolde him newes of his deare friend Bosabels arriuall.
It gladded his very soule, for as it he loued him.
Him for gratitude doth Galtenor extoll aboue all the Princes in the world.
Let vs go to ayde our Prince (deare Ladie) for he that is so much indebted to him as we both, it is the least we can do.
His strength and valour do wish had (replied she) to imploy in the thing most desire.
With an embrace the Pagan encouraged himselfe, and commaunding his Galleon to be directed towardes the
Tower, in a trice he rusht in among the Barks there.
Easily he might haue suncke them, with the aduantage of his being the strongest best in all the Fléetes, but yet he would not, saue enter them with his person.
By his manner of fight he knew his friend, wherevpon he committed his Galleon to the stout Lysarte, that shewed himselfe that day to be a good warriour.
The Gréeke Louer wanted now no friends, for on the other side came the haughtie Oristoldo, all couered with Pagans blood.
Abstrusio first arriued, whom euery one feared, séeing him so sterne and mightie: from his owne to Rosabels shippe he leapt, pronouncing his proper name.
It much contented him to haue such a friend by his side.
Little could Alicandros Nephewes winne at their hands: for the Pagan merits not comparison with lesse then with Brauorant, and if hee haue any aduantage ouer him, it is more then is knowne.
In his assault he strooke Don Celindo on the helme: had he done it with aduise, it had béene the last, with the latest moment of his life: neuerthelesse being besides his head, it falleth him headlong downe.
He clasped him twixt his armes, thinking eyther to kill or imprison him.
Either hée mought haue done, if the gallant Don Argante had not lept thither from his vessell.
Of haughtie courage was the youth, so vpon the Pagans barke he discharged a fierce blowe, which made him leaue Don Celindo, and tarne vpon him.
Against them both would the Pagan defend himself, to his honour, had he place to wilde about his strong armes: but there was such little roome, as they were all heaped togither one vppon another.
Yet Rosabell brauely kéeping his standing, knowe not with whom may compare him, vnlesse it be with him whom Fortune exalted aboue all knights: who, while matters thus past to eternize the Gréekes fame, appeared in sight of both armies, like the God of warre himselfe, whose arriuall deserueth farre more then another Chapter.
How to the battel arriued the two Princes, Claramant and Claridiana: and what ende happened to the aduenture of the Tower.
TIred with bloodie conflicts of sterne warre, now will returne me (faire Ladies) to Loues swéet pleasing battels, whither bringing those two that haue the sole preheminence ouer al others in armes, and onely to liberate the beauteous Lyriana, shall not néed to craue your fauors thereto, for trust (though not all) some wil denie it me.
This hope animates me to procéed in this laborinth, and commit the two princes to your protecting smiles.
Plowing vp the billowes of the calme seas, they resembled the glorious sunne, appearing through the clowdes, displaying his firie rayes.
The world (braue Prince) is so full of your haughtie déeds, that there néeds no more triall to eternize them: wherefore let me intreate you at this time, to let me be formost in this attempt, that presuming on your helpe, may winne some honour by your ayde.
Most warlike warrior (replied he) considering the necessitie, you should not demand of me, what ought to intreat of you: for where your axe hewes his passage, there my sword is not required.
So doo as you will, for meane to kéepe where am, to enioy the sight of your déeds.
And as thinke, there is more to do at the Tower then any where else.
He néeded not to haue said so, for Galtenor that guided their barke, directed it thither.
Straight did Trebatios vnknowne sonne close his beauer, and setting one foote on the edge of his vessell, with his axe twixt both hands, he entred betwéene both armies, crying: Grecia, Grecia, that none might strike him.
There was none but much reioyced, séeing one with Theseus axe at one end, and the other, with the best sword in the world, defending his backe at the other.
More furious did not Hercules shewe himselfe among the Cennaures, nor Theseus beating at the brazen gates of Hell, then were the two Princes among those miserable Infidels.
No blow doth the new Mars bestowe, but riddes his father of an enemie: who was ouerioyed with pleasure, séeing the excellent disposition, of them both.
He expressed it to the two Gyants that were with him, saying.
Haue you euer séene any knights of haughtier disposition? credit me, these be they will winne our victorie.
thinke no lesse (said the King of Cerdina for excepting my Lord the Emperor of Trebizond, haue not beheld any of better constitution and shape of bodie then the formost.
It is so (said Brandafidell but Ile be suretie for the other, that he will not for his part loose any iot of the victorie.
Why then (spake the Emperor Trebatio let vs behold the triall of their brauerie.
Quicly did they verifie it to bee true, for passing by the imperiall Admirall, and thinking the Emperor to be there, they did their dutie very gallantly.
Swifter then the winde past their Barke forward, till it came euen where Rosabell was: round beset with mightie enemies was the lustie Brittaine, for Epirabio a valiant Pagan, with others, excéedingly troubled him.
So was Abstrusio by the rest that were in the shippe, as is alreadie said.
Now Claramant arriued, and with a flourish swaying about his axe, hee strooke the Pagan on the helme: it is too weake to defence the head, for with a big wound he was felled.
To succor him came the braue Assyrian Prince, who heere got nothing now, for the rigorous axe will not pardon Loue it selfe: the which was discharged on the midst of his shield: It cleft it in two, and had not his armor béene Telimonios, his breast had béen so too: yet hee stumbled backwards, not knowing what he did.
Then turned he vpon the two valiant brothers, reaching Floraliza besides her helme: and although her beautie did not deserue it, he made her stumble as shee would fall.
At her did Rosabell let driue, felling her altogither on the gound.
To helpe her hasted Don Argante, which was to no small effect, hitting Claramant a venturous blow on his armes, making him loose his, whose force could not but haue indaungered Don Like an angrie Lyon did the gallant Torisiano set vpon Lyrianas er, and giuing him on his helme a most fierce blow.
By this was Floraliza on his féete, who more furious then an Hyrcanian beast, with both hands raised Camillas sword, laying it on Rosabell before he rose.
With a little more, she had layde him along: yet
she stayed to giue him a thrust at his rising, which she did with the vtmost of her strength, driuing him two steppes from her.
Disgraced was the Brittaine here, for either tripping one leg with another, or by the strength of the blowe, he fell on his backe at Don Celindos féete.
Who thinking he had occasion by the front, would not omit it, for seeing him so stagger, he turned his sword about ouer his head, and discharged it at full on the Gréekes helme.
Doubt do the wise men, to whether Rosabels fall may be attributed.
It extreamly gréeued Abstrusio that was hard by him, then who was neuer Lyon more fierce.
He met with Floraliza, that eagerly followed the Gréeke, on whose shield he layde the waight of his armes with his broad sword, in such manner, that beating it against her head, it left her sencelesse.
He had time to turne vpon Don Celindo, that would haue knéeled on the Brittaine, whom he gaue so mightie a stroke on his shoulders, that he inforced him backwards faster then he came.
Then gaue hée the Pagan his hand, who quickly got on his legges, and so at his pleasure tooke his reuenge on the brothers, that they were fully requited with interest.
In this season was not Claridiano so ydle, as to witnesse what his vnckle performed, for neuer any knight did better backe his friend.
There was no Gyants durst come neare the inchanted barke, but in satisfaction of his presumption, left his life in the handes of the one or other.
Sometimes would Claramant hitting his enemie with his axe, strike him euen to Claridianos standing, who finished the reckoning, bereauing him of his life, whose fortune brought him thither.
The horror which was made there, séemed no lesse then if the whole frame of heauen would fall: for all the famous Pagans repaired to the Tower, maintaining the battell in an equall state where they were: but in all other places else, there was nothing heard but victorie for the Gréekes.
Breaking through so many valiant aduersaries rusht the inchanted Barke, till it confronted Brufaldoros.
It much pleased Claramant to beholde the Pagans disposition, and with what furie hée defended his arch.
With thousands of dead bodies hee had strewed the vast sea, hauing thitherto with honor augmented his fame: but the blinde Goddesse intending altogither to fauor the Grecians, conducted thither the inuincible Claramant, all died with Sarazens blood.
The Moore then ended the felling of the gallant Persian on his Barke, to poore Laissas extream grief that beheld it: who quickly saw him pay for it dearly.
For as the Barke past all the Christian vessels, made the warriour way, somewhat he might reuenge them for their sustained disgraces, and others (that waighed not their honours) because they would not meddle with him.
Many left their fights, hearing that the Knight of the Lyons combatted with him that kept the arches of the Tower.
Most nimble was the Moore, and knowing his enemies valor, with what aduantage he had with his axe, he purposed to procéed warily in this battel, and helpe himselfe with that dexteritie the heauens had lent him.
So with his shield on his arme, and his sword poynting outwardes, stayed for him.
The venturous youth did not respect nor care toward his aduersaries blows, saue onely brandished his axe about, letting it fall where it would, but Brufaldoro was no knight to bee assaulted so openly and carelesly, for letting the axe flie ouer his head, he set his knées on the ground, and in that manner he gaue the Prince so mightie a blowe on his left side.
Had not his armor béene so sure, in two hee had béen diuided, yet it made him stagger as if hee would haue fallen on that side.
This was the first and greatest blowe that Claramant receiued.
With more aduise he turned, and being well setled, whilded aloft his axe.
All his trickes nor agilitie auayled the great Mauritanian king, for falling on the edge of his shield, all it reached was cut away, letting the cruel blow light on the Pagans temples.
Neither armor nor inchantment can resist the furious axe, for in sight of the greatest Princes and best knights of the world, the mightie K. of Mauritania with a daungerous wound was felled all along vppon the hatches of his barke.
Highly was the knight of the Lyons extolde by all the beholders, for they that knew Brufaldoro, and at one blowe saw him on the ground, could not imagine whom his aduersarie might be.
With mightie furie did ye barke passe forward as far as Bembo, at such time as the proud Moore rose in amaze, flinging to his enemie, in his place he encountred the haughtie Claridiano, representing the sterne God of battelles on the seas.
Betwixt them both they began one of the fiercest combats of that day: for the Pagan rores and blasphemes against heauen, when thinking to be reuenged, he met who~ he imagined not, being so brauely to his cost resisted by Claridiano, that many times he was strooke sencelesse.
Many gazed on their fight, iudging him and his companions of the Lyons, the flower of both armies.
Quickly did the furious Claramant, attract all the spectators eyes after him, who then had like to haue incurred much danger, for bearing his ayme on Brauorant, the valiant Bembo stept vnder his armes, and in his passage gaue him a daungerous thrust.
There stayed the Barke, and ere the Gréek could turne about his axe, Achayan was ioyned to Claramant.
The Pagan greatly fearing the Gréekes weapons, went as neare him as he could, and so reached at his sword.
With some amaze hee made him giue backe, else he had easily drawne it.
Claridiano did by chance perceiue it, whereat with one step he was with him.
Neuer did two knights better ayde one another, then the kinsmen.
At his armes he let flie a mightie blowe, it made him forget his hold of the sword, and retire thrée steppes, helped thereto with an enuious thrust.
And hauing performed his succor, he returned very quicke vnto his first place.
For the Assyrian and Don Argante were come thither, to both whom hée made knowne the valor of his person.
Claramant retired a little backe (séeing what had happened him with Bembo to fetch about his axe, which he did with such furie, that it caused chil colde feare in the hearts of the furthest remooued, but not in the valiant Achayan, that nothing at all daunted, entred within him as he raised his weapon, and with his vtmost strength he strooke him on his thighes.
more troublesome blowe had not the Gréek receiued, for the paine thereof made him loose his.
Wherevppon he would haue closed with him: but the mightie Bembo striking his axe outwardes with his sword, and before hee could defend himselfe, hee discharged it on his helme.
He made him set one knée on the ground, and sée the least stars in the firmament at broad day.
Ere he could rise, he strooke him againe on the shoulders with no lesse fiercenesse.
But all this cannot auayle him, to shunne what the cruel Mistresse of inconstant times had decréede against him.
For the Gréeke being well recouered, and strongly getting on his féete, with extreamest furie of inraged wrath, with his remorcelesse axe, he met the Achayans head.
It cut away all the toppe, and a great péece on the side, and had killed him outright, striking somthing lower: yet in a trance he felled him downe.
And so brauely passed forth vnto the third Arche, defended by the flower of Chiualrie.
There was neither friend nor foe but admired ye knight of the Lyons fortitude.
So well was he backed by his Coosen, that his prayses with his Vnckles merits, were sung in an equal key.
For there was no knight so hardie that durst but imagine to interrupt their passage, séeing their maintena~ce.
Within reach one of an other, approached the two warriers.
Brandishing his heauie blade, the Gran Campeons Nephew, prepared himselfe for his defence, with such aspect, that know not he, would not feare him.
Now manner of fight would Claramant haue deuised against him, considering his wel knit sinewes, and strong composed members.
There he repented that little pause, iudging it cowardise to make that small stay.
With his axe on his shoulder and his left foote forward, he went against his enemie, that with his sword in both hands expected him in the same manner.
more fearefull spectacle was neuer séene: for most of the spectators dreading their sight closed their eyes.
So Claramant made as if he would execute his blowe, but in the middest of his course he stayed his weapon, to take him vnawares, as he fetched it about againe.
Carelesse was not the Scythian, but rather none like him, did with more warinesse lay holde of aduantage in the processe of his battels.
And so perceiuing his aduersaries intent, he closed with him so quickly, that when he would haue strooke him, the Pagan had executed his blowe.
There is no knight how valiant soeuer, that hauing receiued such a one, durst haue expected an other: for this forced the Prince backwards within his barke, and dragged his axe after him.
thousand times would the Pagan haue leaped after him, which he left, because he would not forsake his Arch.
brauer blowe in all that warre was not giuen, nor neuer did Claramant receiue a bigger, for it made the blood gush from his nose and nostrels.
So farre had the Pagan run within him, that he could not strike him with his axe, but rather Bramarants fierce sonne seconded it most mightily.
Neuer did Trebatios haughtie sonne do, what at this instant, which was by stepping aside, to shun his aduersaries stroke.
And as he wished it, so hee sawe the stoute Pagan follow the furious waight of his blade.
Wherat the Gréeke setled himselfe on his left foote, and crushing one tooth with an other, with the vtmost
of his strength, he discharged his rage on his Helme.
From it bounded the Axe, else it had battered all his head: neuerthelesse the blowe so astonisht him, that not knowing what he did, he staggard as he would fall.
Whereupon Claramant brauely leapt after him into his Barke: the like did Claridiano, and either supposing the other would not strike him, they both at once executed two most puissant blowes.
Little honour got the kinsmen by the déed, for being two, and of such note, it was rather the Pagans glorie to be vanquished at their hands.
Scarce was the blowe discharged, when the Tower was all couered with a blacke thicke myst, and with the same, with such horror was a larum sounded, as in ye beginning of the conflict.
With thundring and lightnings, shrikes and hideous fearfull cries, and terrible claimours, were both Armies affrighted: the cause was, that Lupercio séeing how his hopes were by Fortune crost, procured to obtaine by his Arte, what with so many thousand men he could not get.
But Nabato the Gréeke friend, that had more skil then he, with Nygromanticke spelles and Coniurations, dissolued the others exorcismes, and so cleared the Tower as before.
From whose highest top was a Ladder let downe, by which two knights might well get vp at once.
Slow to doo it was not the valiant Gréeke, casting his axe vpon his shoulder, at such time as the strong Pagan rose from the ground.
There is no Lyon missing his praie, more fiercer then he, for roaring like a bayted Bull séeing him with the axe ascend, he would haue followed him: but Claridiano preuented it, confronting him, arme against arme, and sword against sword, and with a braue thrust inforst him backe.
Well did Branorant expresse his wrath by discharging his blade with both hands on the others rich helme, the finesse of whose temper, saued his life: yet it did not kéepe him from touching the grounde with his knées, voyding blood from his vysor.
Thither rowed amaine in their Barkes, came with inraged fury, the two lustie warriours, Bembo, and Brufaldoro, by whose comming, Claridiano had incurred much daunger, if they had entered: but the gallant Rosabel, that with Don Celindo and Floraliza combatted, hauing approched so very neare to Brauorants barke, he leapt into it, when Bembo arriued to
The Brytaine hindred him from it, driuing him away with a braue thrust, not onely making him loose his intent, but hopes of euer getting his desires: For the magnanimious Dacian rushing among them, interrupted Brufaldoro from ayding the Scythian.
And so one with others beginning a fierce battell, the second Mars Claramant had time to ascend vp the ladder, not without much paine, for vnséene of him by whom he was strooke, he felt himselfe mortally wounded.
Vnto the top of the Tower he arriued, with more courage then Hector amiddest the Myrmedons, where he was opposed by two deformed Giants with heauie Maces.
But as Fortune had vowed to fauour him, like lightning he put himselfe among them, with the best weapon the world contained.
In middest of the Gallery he stretched him at length, which being broade inough, oh who were able distinctly to dylate the wonders he performed, swaying about his axe: for the Gyants onely are there to fight, from whence they draw strength for their defence, and courage from their wounds: the which maketh our knight take the condition of a Lyon, assayling and retyring, like an Eagle in swiftnesse: but the more hee toyles, the more doth it augment force in his aduersaries, for their inchanment lies in tumbling downe the way Claramant ascended.
Long endured not this strife: for the Prince séeming to feare them, gaue a litle backe, wherat they eagerly followed him, which he well noting, set on him that came foremost, and méeting him right against the ladder, he turned about his axe, with such fury, that with it he feld the Giant ouer, who was neuer more séene.
The Gréeke was of pregnant and sharp vnderstanding, so he straight perceiuing the cause, which made him auoiding a blow of the suruiuer, close with him, suddenly hoysting him aloft, tumbled him the same way his companion went.
If all the frame of heauen and earth had fell, it could not haue caused more feare, then what surprysed the hearts of euery one by the Gyants death.
So wearie remained Claramant, that to ease himselfe, he raised his Beauer, to breathe a while, and so he looked out at a window on the battle, reioycing to sée so many of his enemies vessels to burne with fire.
Long stood he not so, because the wise Nabato in company of the Ladyes, issued out of an other fayre Gallery.
The Gréeke had not till then (since his enchantment) séene any woman, which made him admire these fayres, iudging none might equall the cheefest of them.
Most excellent knight, you may account your selfe in more then may well expresse, hauing ended such an aduenture as this, onely reserued for the valour of your person, and vertue of those armes, the which vntill this instant, haue cost you most deare: yet must you more indure, sustaining many dangers about them: and therefore henceforth begin to take courage.
And as for what you haue done for these Ladies, because in part it concernes your selfe, they shall not néed to thanke you.
And more in this matter am not permitted to say till you shall loose your libertie, recouering then both father, mother, friends and wife.
And while liue, will assist you to my power, for my Lyons sake that is among you, whom account as my sonne.
So for this time ceasing, commit vnto your victorious hands, Lyriana the faire princesse of Nyquea, espoused vnto the valiant Gréek Prince Rosabell, that belowe expected her, brauely backing you with your deare friend.
Hauing thus said, he vanished, Claramant taking the Lady by the hand, fairer then the sun, he ledde her downe the steps, at the noise of such swéete musicke, that it much delighted both fléetes.
Thither repaired most of the valiantest Pagans, imagining the aduenture ended.
Oh Bembo, it touches thée more the~ any, so more then humane deeds doest thou perform, yet all auaile not against thy contrarious fates: for the Gréeke Emperor séeing the aduentures end, co~manded certaine Gyants to rowe him there, with more furie to breake through his enemies: with whom went most of the warlike Knights: He that best deserued in that exigent, discharging the hopes of him expected, was the braue Tartarian Zoylo, being high treasurer of all the fleete, who desirous to shew how much he was indebted to Rosabell, chose out eight of the best furnished Gallies, both of sayle and munition, and with them in a rancke, he set himselfe along the Arches, that way to hinder his aduersaries approach, although all their fléete made thitherwards: and so ioyning with Oristoldo, and his valiant father in his ship, with Abstrusios barke, which was the strongest on all the sea, they brauely resisted the Pagans furie, that then seemed reuenous.
Nothing helped them, for then Claramant descended with his Beauer closed, because he would not be knowne by any.
Farre from him was not the glad youth, most ioyfull séeing his
doo so much desire your content (most valiant Prince,) that to procure it, haue indeuoured to doo thus much: and so in signe that will euer be your friend while life indures, present you with the spoiles, onely due to your vallour.
Braue knight, doo not so much estéeme the good you haue done me by liberating my espowse, although my life depended thereon, as the generositie and magnanimitie wherewith you doo it, which is so great, that cannot requite, saue by perpetually acknowledging the debt you haue bound vs all in, and referre the satisfaction to your owne merits, from whence this memorable act procéeds.
The great hurleburly brake off their farther spéeches, whereat he returned, for the other Ladies and Rosabel with his in his armes, was conducted to the Christians Imperiall Admirall, where the Gréeke Emperour receiued them with the greatest ioy in the worlde.
Presently was victorie proclaimed for the Gréekes: who being assured thereof, fought fiercer then at first.
The sunne with his absence parted that more then wondrous Battle: and so the Pagans fearing their vtter ouerthrow, sounded retrait, leauing the third part of their vesselles swallowed by the sea, with infinit number of Knights and Gyants.
Voyces were giuen altogither to ende the battle: but in the end they resolued the contrary, because their aduersaries held Fortune by the hand, and thereuppon withdrew towards Nyquea, from whence with fresh supplies and new hostes, to turne vpon Grecia they resolued.
Some comfort was this to those that were like to burst with fury.
Bembo would not be cured, til the Souldan himselfe intreated him.
So madde was Brauorant, that none durst looke him on the face.
The wise man, consolated and animated them, saying he did finde by his Art, that if there doo not come more supplies to Grecia, they should surely conquere it: for their partie would be far augmented, by the vniting of many more Princes much wronged by the Gréekes.
Nothing so were the Gréekes, that all the night spent in ioy and pleasure, not missing their lost men, though they were very many.
The Emperor with all his sons, wold néeds passe into Abstrusios
Who requested the kissing of his handes, but the Emperor would not, and imbracing him, said.
If had knowne we had bene all souldiers vnto so braue a Captaine, had with better hopes expected the happie successe of this conflict.
What did, in what degrée soeuer, (most mightie Monarche he replied) was through imagination of the great content hoped would haue redowned by my seruice, the which assure eternally vnto your Crowne.
All the warlike Ladies assembled togither, where Archysilora made her selfe knowne.
In faith, beléeue me faire Quéene, our victorie hath bene too small, since procured by such hands.
Rosamonde reioyced in her hart with her comming, for they intierly loued.
Then the Emperor sent for Venus, and Layssa, who brought with them their two litle daughters, whose bewtie euery one admyred.
There also the graund Trebatio greatly thanked Pollidolpho for his good aide.
And euery one in generall, were busied in the entertainment of so woorthie a successe.
Through all the Fléete, the Emperour commaunded the two knights to be sought for, that had ended the aduenture: but not finding them, he was aduertised how they departed in the greatest haste possible.
After them had the Emperor sent, but that Nabato staied him, that would not depart without visiting his Dacian, and speake to the Emperor, who entertained him as his déeds and merites deserued.
He made reply according to his wisedome, perswading them not to gréeue for the two knights absence, whom they should sée in other new contents, which the one should conceiue vntil death, although the other, is so tormented with amorous cares, that the earth can affoord him no pleasure, because the giuer thereof is in this shippe.
None could directly suspect who he was, yet some iudged him to be Claridiano, and they were the two gallant Ladies, Rosamond and Archysilora, who was comforted with hope to sée him in Grecia, where she would assure him of his glorie, and how that if she were beloued, he was no lesse.
It was presently knowne by spies, how their enemies were withdrawne homewards.
It nothing gréeued them, in that for Lyrianas sake, they willingly would haue accorded to any good motion.
Before that Nabato departed, he aduertised them, they should not dissolue theyr Hostes, for that they would returne vpon Crecia, with the greatest powers on the earth, against which the fierce Lyonesse would rise, stirred vp by the Russet Lyon.
With this he tooke his leaue of the Gréekes, leauing them much bound vnto him.
great while he conferd with Don Eleno, to whome he declared the cause of the future warre, and that since he was the greatest cause thereof, he should procure to make knowne the vtmost of his vallor: because that partie which should most respect him, would most oppresse him, and would many times put him in imminent daungers of his life, yet all should honorably ende, to his lasting fame, and Rosamonds.
The next morning, the victorious Gréekes in tryumphant manner made towards Constantinople, hauing finished the famousest nauall fight that was heard or read of.
Forewards did King Sacridoro put forth, to be the first should beare those happy tydings vnto the Empresse, which he accordingly performed.
And with prosperous windes, not long after they arriued all at Constantinople, in whose welcome, there happened what the next Chapter shall declare.
How the Emperour Trebatio with all his Fleete, arriued at Constantinople.
NO sooner were the furious horses of the Sun, harnest in theyr bright Caparisons of shining light, readie to drawe the golden Charriot of heauens glittering eye, through the Christal paued wayes of the Azure skies, expelling thence the duskie Cloudes of leaden melancholy darkenesse, when the Gréekes gallant Fléete containing so many Princes, and braue Knights, appeared in sight of the famous Citie of Constantinople, sounding so many millitary Instruments, as if that were the instant of the earths generall desolation.
Such thicke smoake of smothering fiery mysts, raised the discharged ordinance in wel ordred peales, that one vessel could not discerne the other.
Which past, the Gallies and Shippes beganne to showe themselues, daring the windes with their proude streamers, and all their toppes with dauncing Banners made of silke, whose méeting displayed in the aire, rauished the beholding sences with ioy: which on the other side, was a corsiue to the hearts of the afflicted prisoners, séeing theirs as trophies of the victorie, set vp among their aduersaries.
The eccho on the water of mellodious harmony of concordant Musicke, was a comfort to the poore wounded souldiers, who were all committed to the warlike Troians charge.
The discréet Citizens were not all this while carelesse, but rather in preparations to feast their Prince had bene most carefull.
All the Castles in the Citie welcommed them according to their vsuall custome, placing on the highest of euery one, the Emperours Imperiall standards.
To the sea side came all the gallant youthes brauely Armed, and euery one a blew scarfe, and in their hands swords and daggers, wherwith they skirmiged as they went.
In two parts they diuided themselues to take the Princes in the middle, that then were comming forth of Abstrusios Admirall.
most faire Bridge they set vp, from the Galleon to the shore, with many stately Arches, all couered with gréen cloth of golde, and they with many curious Pictures, containing all the Gréeke Princes Battles and aduentures.
First marched the Emperor Trebatio, betwéene his two sonnes, representing such Maiestie and chearfull semblance, that therewith his subiects were much gladded.
little behinde them, appeared those thrée Myrrors of beawtie, Lyriana, Archysilora, and Rosamond, who to please the Princesse of Nyquea, had put off their strong abillements of warre.
They were all thrée attyred in gréene, cut vpon cloth of siluer, and tackte with knottes of Pearle, and betwéene euery cut, a button of rich Dyamonds: on whose sparkeling light, the reuerberating sun dazeling thereon, depriued the beholders of the Ladies sight.
Large wide were their garments, with long sléeues hanging to the ground, all richly Embrodered, euen much like the fashion now vsed in France.
Other shorter they woare on their arms, laced ouer with great Orient Pearles, with cuts drawne through with finest cloath of Golde, faced with white and crimson, according to the vsance of the Parthians.
Their disheueld hayre dangled downe in tramels, whereon, there is not any, but would haue hung thereon a thousand soules, and iudge them too fewe for their merits.
To conclude, they were so excéeding absolute in all perfections, that Apollo blushed to bee excelled in bewtie by humane creatures, who to enioy the contemplation of their excellencies, and surfet in imaginary conceits of their rarieties, curbed with his raignes, the hastie galloping of his fierce and vnstayed stéeds.
little after them, followed other thrée, no lesse bewtifull then they.
These wer the gallant Venus, the braue Layssa, with the faire Syrinda.
They would not change colour, and therefore were all in Crimson, cut vpon Golde.
Next to them, the excellent Empresse, Claridiana, attired according to her Maiesticke state and grauitie: yet with such exquisit bewty, that the former sixe became enuious of her faire.
She passed on with the mightie Abstrusio, whom all the Gréekes much affected.
At the end of the bridge, vpon a tryumphant arch, stood thrée images, most liuely representing the first thrée ladies.
Not far from them, thrée Syrens, with Amber tresses dangling to the ground came forth, and playing on seuerall Harpes, sung seuerall notes one after the other, thus.
From the Lillies is she hight, Robed with Emperious might: Yet she staynes the Lillies white.
When she had done, then the second turning to the Quéene of Lyra, sung.
Earthly thing giues not her name, Earth cannot expresse the same: Heauenly tis, and thence it came.
The third, with no lesse swéetnesse, remembred Rosamond, in this manner.
Though last, not least, but with the best, The worldes sweete Rose is well exprest: faire euer blest.
Hauing all ended, they recorded them togither, with such recording voyces, to the consort of their delightfull musick, nothing different from Angels harmony.
And as they went vnder it, from the opening of a Cloude, spredde vnder the Arch, after a tempest of artificall thunder and lightening, there raigned downe, an odoriferous shewer of swéete fragrant flowers, whose comfortable odour, reuiued all their mindes.
Before they had passed it, from the thickest of the same Cloude, there descended thrée mightie Eagles, eyther with a coronet of flowers in their billes: and whipping the ayre with their great winges: they with them, crowned the thrée most gallant Ladies.
So soone as they were gone by, and Venus with her company come thither, the thrée Syrens, to a new dulced tune, with one voyce sung this note.
An other faire of like fame, That doubtfull tis, which hand will winne the game.
The twelue Gouernors of the Empire, with all the courtiers and gallants of the Cittie, expected their landing at the shore: where twelue auncient Peeres, clad in long robes of cloath of Golde trayling on the ground, tooke the sixe Ladies vnder a cannabie, whose value excéeded estimation, and in that equipage marched forward, till they stayed to behold a Castle, erected and drawne on foure whéeles: within they rung a larum bell, crying, Nyquea, Nyquea: aduancing on the highest of the same, thrée Ensignes, with the Ladies armes.
Then in rich Armour issued out thereof, thrée well accomplished Knights, who aloude made a challenge, to maintaine they were the Paragons for bewtie and fortitude.
There wanted not enemies to defend the contrarie: for from the same Castle came foorth nine knights, betwéene whom, they began a braue combat at barriers.
Then beganne the Castle to mooue, discharging so many fireworkes, as if it were al on a flame.
The Ladies wold not mount on horeseback, because they were very neare the chiefe gate of the Cittie, through which the Theban Duke issued foorth with the imperial Ensigne: who intreated the Ladies in the Cittizens behalfe, to dispose of the Citie as their natural Lords.
They returnd their tha~kfulnes according to their states, highly estéeming of their solemne entertainment, which had so excéedingly contented Lyriana, that shee accounted all her forepassed troubles well bestowed, since they had brought her to so happie ende.
In all the Court there was not any but came to sée the arriuall of their Princes.
In opinion was the Ladies beautie had, whether of the thrée was fairest: for Lyrianas sight had attracted all eyes.
Such presse of people were in the stréetes, that had not the Emperours guard gone before, they had not béene able to passe.
But beeing entred into the yard, new matters did happen, for an alarum bell was with furie rung in Lyndabrides inchantment: which ended, they heard a most heauenly noyse of swéet musick.
Ther was none but demanded the cause of that vnaccustomed accident.
That by reason of the Nyquean Princesse comming, the gates were opened, that euerie one that would, might fréely prooue the aduenture.
Very great pleasure conceiued the Emperour Trebatio thereat: so did the grand Alphebo, imagining the end of the aduenture was at hand, so much by them desired.
do omit (faire Ladies) to shunne prolixitie, their newe welcomes in the Hall: onely remembring Oliuas ioy, with the sight of Lyriana and her sonne Rosabell, whom also with the other Ladies, sonnes, and kisme~, the Empresse Briana, most kindly entertained.
Few daies after, was the Brittaine Prince, with the Princesse of Nyquea, married by the Patriach of Constantinople, being first baptized, which sacred and diuine Sacrament, Rosamond would also receiue, for her dear Lords sake.
New triumphs had béen ordained, but that the proofe of the disamorous Tower did intercept them: for as the promised reward was so great, euery one procured most, to shew himselfe most forward in that aduenture.
Dinner being done, there wanted no knights that offered the trial, but as it required such great valour, ere the sunne setting, there was hung about the Tower, aboue two hundreth Shieldes, euery one placed according to his Maisters deserts.
Drowne would Apollo his cleare light, in Thetis watery lappe, when through the place there entered a gallant and well accomplished Knight, clad in rose colour Armour, and brauely mounted.
Who galloping along, leaped from his saddle, and with admirable brauery passed into the Tower.
Many suspected he would end the aduenture, séeing with what courage hee ascended the defended steps.
But foure he wanted, when vnable to goe any further, hee was sencelesse cast from the Tower, hauing his Shéelde set very neare vnto the haughtie Troians.
This knight was a valiant Pagan Lord, of Lesbos Ile, not farre from Troy.
Who hauing landed a little after the Ladies came thither, at such time, that he well made knowne the prowesse of his person.
Scarce had this stout Pagan lost his entrance, but Lyriamandros haughtie sonne, named Tersildo, presented himselfe, to be no lesse valiant then frée from the vnweildie yoake of of loue.
His Armour was of Azure colour, with many starres of Golde.
In the middest of his shield, was portrayed a knight treading on Cupid, hauing his Bow and Quiuer broken: with this Motto.
Loue resisted is a childe, Suffered, is a Tyger wilde.
The scourge of heauen, and earth, hell, sea, and land, Is scourg'd and maistered by a humane hand.
There was no Lady there, but gréeued at his frée deuice, nor neuer did they more wish any knights vanquishment, as this: thinking it was an iniurie vnto their sexe, to haue him liue at libertie.
Quickly was their desire satisfied: for proouing the entrance, he did couragiously arriue as farre as the Pagan, whence with like violence hee was cast forth: whose vnhappie chance did greatly please all the Ladies present.
The nights approach with sable couerture, taking her place in Phoebus absence, brake off the instant tryall: whereupon the Emperour with his company returned to the Pallace, where was open reuelling.
Rosabell daunced with Lyriana, and euery Prince with his beloued Lady, to their incomparable ioy.
All which, did but more and more gréeue the Quéene of Lyra, for wanting her Claridiano, she was not capable of the least pleasure: so was she there present onely, but in person, for her soule wandred to séeke him.
Iust guerdon for her straungenesse, which she long time was forced to suffer: for although he was in the Gréeke warres, none knew him (as in the fourth of this part shall be expressed) nor would he be knowne to any, imagining his Lady to bee still displeased with him: whose sight did sufficiently strengthen him to tollerate his paines.
But now we are inioyned to leaue her, and the disamorous proofe to explicate the manner, how the Princesse Roselia, and Arbolinda of Scotland were liberated, whome in the Forrest, thrée miles from Rome, wee left enchaunted.
How Claridiano and Claramant arriued at the Port of Rotta, where they founde the straunge enchauntment of Roselia, and what haughtie deedes of Chiualrie they there performed in the company of Alphebo, Brauorant, and Don Celindo.
PLowing the foming Billowes of the vast déepe sea, with their inchaunted barke (most bewtious dames) we left Claridiano and Claramant, with no small ioy, for the good successe of the valiant Gréekes, and yet much wondred at the litle reason the Nyquean Souldan, had not to accept as his sonne in law (whom Darius would not haue refused) the famous Britaine Rosabell, Competitor with Mars himselfe in armes: and for state and royaltie, equall to the Gréeke Macedonian Alexander.
Of these such like matters did the two Gréeke warriors discourse, admirnig to behold, with what swiftnesse their barke
And to sée whether they could discern any Hauen or Arbor, not long after they descried one, the fayrest and safest that they euer sawe, the which Claridiano ouerioyed thereat, tolde his vnckle it was the famous Port of Rotta, thrée myles from the renowned Cittie of Rome, whereat they desired to land, because they wished to sée a place so glorious as that.
Theyr will was quickly accomplished, for the Barke with incredible Vellocitie came a shore in the same Hauen, where the Princes imagined they were to abide: whereupon landing and mounting on theyr Horses, they tooke theyr best way to Rome, which Claridiano partly knew, hauing before bene there.
And crossing a great wood, they came into a fayre playne all dyaperd with Floras fragrant Tapestry, ouer which an Imperious Castle séemed to commaund: whose loftie heigth and toplesse Pyramedes, controwled the starry Firmament.
In middest thereof, stood an Alabaster Tower, fiue wayes squared, the workemanship thereof, greatnesse and altitude, amazed the Princes.
At euery edge of the square, it had thrée Bulwarkes of finest Iasper, so that the middle Tower was incompassed with fiftéen Bulwarkes.
Round about, it was Moted, with a broad déepe Ditch, ouer which, fel a draw Bridge, to passe it: at the farthest ende thereof, there stood a mightie big Christal Piller, on which hung by Chaines of gold, fiue rich Hornes, a litle beneath, a Table with Letters, that yéelded such splendor, as they almost depriued the beholders sight.
Greatly did the Prince wonder at the straunge rich Edefice, and so Claramant said.
Truly (most excellent Prince) this séemes to be a most gallant aduenture, if we may iudge it by the strong fortefied bignesse of the Castle, Tower, and Bulwarkes, whose like, mine eyes til now did neuer yet behold: nor is it possible they should againe see such another.
And therefore much desire to reade the Letters of the Table, if you so thinke it good, to be certified therof, for least be deceiued, this should be some Inchauntment: and if it be, of no smal estéeme should the person inchaunted be of.
Answere would Claridiano, when through the aire they heard a hideous noyse, by the rising of a sudden whirlewind, with such horror, that it séemed to leade a Legion of diuels after it, leauing the way desolate by which it past, renting by the rootes all ye pines,
This sight confounded the Princes, who looking to sée the ende, they sawe a blacke fogge rise ouer the ditch, whose obscure aspect, depriued Tytan of his bright rayes: but a litle after, the Welkin cleared, and Apollo being restored to his former light, they discerned the Bridge raised aboue ten faddome high, hindering the passage ouer: and on this side, there was placed an other Piller, but of Brasse, with an inscription of Emerald Letters, that signified the aduenture.
Not speaking one to another, they went to the Piller, and hauing learned all maner of languages, they could reade this in the Germane tongue thus.
Let none, (though Mars in Armes) be so daring as to pretend the libertie of Roselia, vnlesse they be fiue Warriors, whose famous deeds haue through the world extended their eternall glorie: for till they shall be togither in this Forrest, the passage ouer the Moate shall be graunted to none.
Whereupon Claridiano tooke occasion thus to speake vnto his vnckle.
thinke (heroicke Prince) it is in vaine for vs to offer to proue the aduenture, séeing the words say, there should bee fiue that must doo it togither.
Oh how should reioyce, were we now accompanied with the strength of Paganisme, Brauorant, Bembo, and Brufaldoro, that we might vndertake this enterprise: but séeing the wise men haue thus ordered it, let vs if you please, go vnto the populous Cittie of Rome, where you shall sée such antiquities, that without admyration you cannot behold.
Be it as you haue said (mightie Lord) replied Claramant, for wil in all things obey you.
As these famous Princes of Greece were about to tread the next way to the Cittie, they heard a great noyse towards the sea coast, as if many knights were in battle togither, whose horror of vncontrowled blowes, was no lesse then that of Vulcans Aetnean
Slow were not they that were borne to fight, in pricking their swift stéeds thitherward: and hauing crost the Forrest hard by the shore in a fayre plaine, they sawe two sturdie knights in Combat one against the other.
third of no lesse gallantnesse mounted, and leaning on his speare, beheld them.
To him went Mars his Competitors, and after due courtesie, Claramant thus said.
You shall not a little fauour vs Sir knight, to let vs know the cause of so terrible fight, which in mine opinion, will not cost lesse, then eythers life, with such furie they prosecute it.
So much haue your kinde words bound me, (Sir knight answered hee) that cannot in honour denie to satisfie all your demaund.
Know therefore, that you bigge knight in Russet armor, is called Brauorant, one of the strongest that this day breathes: who hauing taken part with the Souldan of Nyquea, in his last expedition against Grecia, where he lost most of his ships and men in the Nauall battell, as no doubt you haue heard: this knight left him of purpose, to sayle vnto his kingdome, to assemble new powers against the Gréekes on the Souldans behalfe, hauing sworne vtterly to distroy them.
And I, Don Celindo by name, desirous to sée the high déedes of this most famous warrier, did offer my selfe to associate him, which hee refused not.
So to morrowe will bee eight dayes, wee departed from the Souldans Fléete, in a well rigged shippe.
Long sayled we not with prosperous weather, but were by a cruell storme cast on this shore: where finding this Knight, the valiantest (as his fame memorateth) that euer the spacious worlde hath known, we knew him straight to bee the Emperour Alphebo of Trebizond (for treacherous Lupersio had conducted him thither to end his desire.)
Whom Brauorant knowing to haue beene on the Grecians side, and remembring the waight of his cruel blowes, did on the instant challenge him: and for this slight occasion, they so batter and mangle one an others Armor and flesh.
No longer stayed Claridiano, but vnderstanding that knight to bee his father, drew forth his sworde and stepped betwéene them, with these words.
Withholde braue Knights, for so fierce a quarrell is not lawfull on so small occasion, since the losse of eyther wil be a noted want vnto the world.
In faith (braue Knight) were it but onely in respect of your gentle spéech, would haue done it: how much the more, when winne thereby, wanting an equall estimation with this knights valour.
How milde the Paga~ was, being mildly, vsed, how tractable is alreadie exprest: who now hearing his aduersaries gentle words, did accordingly make his answer to the Emperor.
So greatly haue your frendly words inchayned me to your obeysance (most mightie Lord) that thogh this knight had not requested it, would haue desisted from the combat, especially, it being my aduantage, considering how Fame throgh euerie mouth blazoneth your woorth, and my vnwoorthinesse.
As Claridianas Lord would haue aunswered, Claramant intercepted him thus.
If (most valiant knights) the greatest part of your rigorous battel, hath béene to manifest vnto the world the rarenesse of your vnmatched strength, wherewith the heauens hath armed you, then go with vs, where there is occasion offered, whereon you may more securely imploy your redoubted valors in lawful attempts of brauest armes, which may be vndertaken with more sufficient reasons, then you began this your slender quarrell.
For know, that at the end of this Forrest, in the middest of a faire plaine, we found a Fortresse, which we iudge to bee the strongest on the earth, and reading certaine letters insculped in a Table, we perceiued it to be the inchauntment of the Princesse Roselia, daughter to the Emperor of this land: and more, that none but fiue knights togither, whose fame the world should report to be admirable, should prooue the aduenture.
Wherefore since you be they (according to the conditions required) it were vniust we should neglect the libertie of so great a Princesse.
And although my companions merits and mine owne, be not in the least degrée, such as the aduenture challengeth, it shal satisfie vs to march vnder the shadow of such woorthies, to end a more harder enterprise.
am content to offer my person to the proofe, although in me there bée nothing meriting your praise: but the controuersie had with this knight, hath béen ynough to teach mee to imitate his valor.
I, to haue stolne some part thereof from him to incourage me to this attempt.
It shall not be left for me, (said Don Celindo for in the company of such knights, the hardest is the easiest to be atchiued.
Then Brauorant, it is not lawfull the libertie of so great a Ladie should be remitted through my meanes, although my fame nothing deserues your estimation.
Then let vs no longer delay the triall of so happie a proofe (said Claridiano: who presently spurred his swift Courser, leading the way vnto the braue inchauntment.
Followed he was by the flower of armes: that altogither in short space arriued at the déepe mote, where they admired the greatnesse and exquisit workmanship of the Castle, whose like they accorded the world contained not: especially when Alphebo saide, it excelled that of Lindaraza, where he disinchanted his father, as in the first of the first part of this great Historie.
No sooner were these valiant warriors arriued, when the (that yet stood on high) was let downe, which hauing past, they stept to the Piller whereon the hornes hung.
When the fiue warriours the aduenture doth require, shall bee here togither, if they be of such daring hearts, as to prooue it, let each of them hang one of these hornes about his necke, and winding them, the Castle gates shall be opened, and they may enter.
In performance thereof, these mightie Princes were nothing slow, but euery one louingly imbraced one another, they each of them presented themselues before either of the Castles, whose gates presently flew open at the shrill founding of the hornes, the eccho whereof, was also heard within the Citie of Rome.
Throgh the doore that befel vnto the inuincible Alphebo, issued a deformed vgly big Gyant, mounted on a lustie Courser, with a strong knottie lance in his hand, hauing a pike of well tempered stéele, aboue two handfuls in length.
Him Alphebo receiued with the swiftest running of his horse, the like did the Gyant, with such furie as the earth could scarce beare them.
They met so strongly, that the gyants big lance flew in péeces, against the inpenetrable shield of the knight of the Sunne, whose shiuers hissing through the ayre, mounted higher then the proude toppe of the inchantment.
The Gyants mightie speare was not of strength to pearce Alphebos thield, the which was resisted by the magicke spelles wherewith Lyrgandeo had forged it: yet was hee cast backwards ouer his saddle bowe, loosing the raines out of his hand.
know not to what shall compare the Emperour of Trebezounds incounter: for hitting the gyant in middest of his shield, he pearced it, togither with the plates of stéele, and priuie coate, whose inchaunted power vnable to defend the
lance guided by so braue an arme, he ran it through his left side, mortally wounding him directly on his heart, against which the strong speare bending, he broke it, and leauing a péece in the wound, the rest flew into the middle region of the ayre.
So passing forward, they met with such a shocke, that it deserues eternall memorie: for as the two warriors, incountred shield against shield, and bodie with bodie, the haughtie knight of the Sunne, first ranne against the Gyant vpon the speares trunchion, which hee so vehemently thrust through his bodie, that it cleft into his miserable heart: yet he scapt not so frée, but felt himselfe so brused on his Corneryno, that the poore horse was driuen to strike his buttockes on the ground, along whose backe his Maister fel, in such amazement, that he knew not whether he was in heauen or on earth.
But recouering himself, and iudging it cowardise, he set spurres vnto his horse, which made him fetch light carreirs vppon the ground.
And looking after his aduersarie, he sawe him lie vpon the earth, voyding his blood as through a riuer: by him lay his horse with his shoulder broken, and both at one instant accompanied each other in death.
little reioyced not the courteous Emperor at his spéedie good successe, and after his due thankes to God for his victorie, would not procéede vntill the end of Brouorants battell, whom hee iudged one of the best knights of the world, wherein hee nothing deceiued himselfe.
Who hauing sounded the rich horne, whereat the Gates burst open, whence came foorth a well proportioned Gyant, both brauely mounted and clad in defensiue armes, with a huge mace of seldséene greatnesse in his hands.
Against him made Bramarants sonne, brandishing his launce aboue his head: so did the Gyant with his mace: but in the méeting, Campeons Nephew mist his incounter, running his speare through the head of his aduersaries horse, who as Brauarant past by him, discharging his mace with such strength in the middest of his shield, the which (though inchanted) it battered and descended to his helm: where it fell so heauily, that maugre his courage, it made him bend his head below his brest, and voyde much blood.
There is no Lyon crueller, nor chafed Bull more furious then is now the inuincible Scythian: for hauing wel recouered his seat, drawing foorth his slycing blade, with more fiercenesse then a thunderbolte, hée looked for his enemie, who~ he saw on féet, with his mace aloft.
him hee went, but first brauely leapt from his horse, and griping his sword strongly twixt his hands, he neglected to watch his aduantage, but let flie at the Gyant: so did he, and at once executed two blowes woorthie such warriors.
Venturous was the Gyants blowe, for lighting on his enemies helme, although it could not breake the inchantment, it forced him to tumble headlong on the paued floore, where hee thought he sawe the twinckling of more starres then is in the firmament.
The Gyant had no time to vaunt of his victorious blow, for with another nothing inferior, his shield was cut in two, through which the sword descended to his helme, cutting away all the one side thereof, with all the top, the which had it fell right, his head had béene cleft in the middest: yet fell he to the ground on his hands, amazed with the stroke.
The haughtie Emperor not a litle admired the strength of the combattants, much estéeming the Gyant, considering Brauorants disgrace: whom he animated, (though néedlesse) with these words.
Courage braue warrior, for there is much to doo: but making the world knowe the vtmost of your singular valor, with it we shall easily liberate the Princesse Roselia.
Though almost choked with chollor, and blaspheming against himselfe, (for no God he confest) hee turned his head at those words, and séeing the Knight of the Sunne not fighting, because he had alreadie killed the gyant, there is no tongue able to explicate the furie that entred the fierce Pagans breast, supposing that knight excelled him, when he would not acknowledge Mars any superioritie.
And accounting it base fearfulnesse to let a single combat indure to the third blowe, foming through the mouth, he raised his sword and went against the Gyant, that was alreadie vp: who well noted with what furie he came, and trusting to his Mace, crost it ouerhead, whereon fell the strongest blow bestowed in his time.
For being possest with the vtmost of extreamest rage, Brauorants son desirous to make known the might of his arme, hee discharged on him a fierce stroke worthie his valor) which falling on the mace, (whose inchauntment being of no force) it cut it like as it were of wood, and sliding to the shoulder, where his armor was not able to resist ye sharpnes of ye sword, (guided by the strongest arme that euer the Gyantiue nation knewe) it sliced him in the middest, diuiding the brutish bodie in two parts: which déede the Knight of the Sunne so admired, as he iudged him to be sonne to such a
Litle had the fierce Pagan thought he had done, wherevpon like an infernall furie he entred the gate.
All this while was not the Heroicke Claridiano ydle, for in the opening of the Portall, at the shrilnesse of the horne, there issued foorth a mightie Centaure, with a big dart in his right hand, and in the other a chaine, by which he ledde a cruell Lyon.
This sight daunted not the second Mars, but swifter then a Roe he prickt against the Centaure, that expected him, brandishing his stéely dart, the which, ere the prince came neare him, hee flung at him with all the strength of his arme, it ranne through the shield, and wounded him a little on the breast, pearcing his armor, whose inchauntment could not withstand the sharpenesse of the speare.
The Prince hit the Centaure in the middest of his breast with such puissance, that had not his plates of fine tempered stéele, (wherewith he was armed) defended him, he had béene then slaine, yet he so thrust him backe, that staggering vp and downe, hee fell on the ground, at such time as his horse past on, which stumbling on ye Centaure, fel shrewdly on the earth, where it had cost Claridiano no lesse then the price of his life, had he not vsed his dexteritie, wherewith hee leapt at one side from off his back before hee fell, the which scarcely touched the ground, when the cruell Lyon with his pawes seyzed on him, and rent him asunder péece by péece, which much auailed for the Princes victorie, for whilest the Lyon deuoured the horse, he discharged at his pleasure the waight of his armes vpon his head, of the which, as much as the murthering sword did take, was cut away: yet the blowe was not sufficient to kil him outright, but rather roring amaine, it forced him leaue his pray to flie at Claridiano, closing with him so spéedily, that he could not shunne him, but with his sharpe clawes helde him so hard, that hee crusht his crimson blood through his armor, gryping him closer then doth the little Remora cleaue to the kéele of any shippe, to hinder her swift course.
In great anguish of minde was the warlike Gréeke all this while, féeling himselfe so fast bound betwéene the Lyons fangs, and séeing the Centaure come against him with a heauie naked sword.
No remedie found Mars his Competitor, but to draw his dagger, and stabbing it into his bellie, forced the Lyon with the pangs of death to leaue him, the which méeting with the Centaure, not knowing what it did, catcht
at his brest, which with his clawes he rent, letting foorth riuers of blood through his mortal wound.
Whereat the fierce Centau for+saking the Prince, raised his blade on high, and with it diuided the Lyon in two.
Which done, trailing the one halfe with him, he marched towards Claridiano, who wondring at the sight, did so too, and on his shield tooke the beasts blowe, which he requited with a poynt that he thrust at him, which penetrating his plates of stéele, wounded him to the death.
Roaring like a Bull, the Infernal Monster towred his sword aloft, which when he would descend, he was staied in the midst of his course, by the remorcelesse stroke of death: whereat he fel downe, at the time that Claridiano thanked his God for the victorie.
And imagining his companions were afore him, he past on through the gate.
No lesse fierce was Claramants renowned battle, for in the end of the hornes shril sound, there appeared a wel disposed knight, richly armed and mounted, bearing a Launce in his hand, and a big Cemitor at his saddle bow.
Our new Mars nothing feared him, but spurred his horse against him, and méeting in middle of their course, their shiuered launces flew into the ayre, giuing place vnto the furious shocke of their bodies.
Trebatios sonne was faine to get about his horse neck, for feare of falling, hauing almost lost his bridle: but recouering his seat, he spyed his aduersarie lie on the ground, groueling vnder his horse, striuing to get from it.
Courteous was Claramant, and so alighted to helpe his enemie, which kindnesse he had like to haue dearly bought, for through the gate that the knight issued foorth, flew out a hideous terrible Griffon, who suddainly surprising the Prince, clasped his bodie about, and with his sharpe tallents crushed his armor within his flesh, and vehemently fluttring his wings aloft, raised him a litle, purposing to haue mounted on high, and then to let him fall, and beate him in péeces against the stones.
It happened not as the beast intended: for the Prince noting how treacherously he had béene assayled, and féeling his flesh brused in many places, and his armor with his owne blood bedewed, stretcht foorth his armes on high, more inraged then an angred Tyger, and getting hold by his wings, pluckt him downe, making him loose his pretended flight, and so both fell on the ground.
And the haughtie Gréeke being of great force, turned vppon him, where refusing to vse any of his weapons, being extreame wrathfull, hee seized on either wing, which with the vtmost of his strength, hee pluckt away by the rootes, leauing the truncke without motion, voyding inuenombde gore from the wounds.
Hee performed not this so safely, but he had his helme cleft in two, a small wound on the head, the which the vgly beast had done with his inchanted bill, whose death preuented his further daunger.
By this was the knight recouered, and with his shield and sword marched against the Prince, but what auales it: for Bryanas sonne being swelled with wrath, tarried for him, with his axe, who directed a blowe towards the disarmed part of his head.
The angrie Prince would not receiue it, because he would not indanger his life, but leaping at one side, gaue place vnto his enemies blowes, whose sword ranne almost to the middest into the ground, and he himselfe followed it.
The occasion would not Claramant forgo, but like a Fawlcon at his pray, stept to him, and with his axe strooke him to the earth, where hée tumbled vp and downe.
So Claramant desirous to make an ende, closed with him.
But the knight with the feare of death pluckt him vppon himselfe by the skirt of his armor, making him loose his blowe, and casting his armes about him, thought to get some ground of him: but the vnhappie knight missing his purpose, the gallant Prince helde him fast, and setting one knée vpon his breast, with his dagger opened a passage through it for his hatefull life, sending him to bee wasted ouer the infernall poole, by the blacke of hell.
Thankes did hée render to the god of his father for the victorie, and without further stay, as he would passe on, he heard a great crie, and turning his head, hée sawe it was a Gyant dragd about the féeles by his horse, with one leg hanging in his stirrope.
The cause was, that Don Celindo hauing winded his horne, and his Castle opening, that Gyant on a mightie Courser issued foorth.
Agaifist him went Alicandros Nephew, but bing ouer eager, mist his incounter, and was by the Gyant strooke along his horse backe.
Either past by the other brauely set in his seate, where drawing
their strong swords, they laide such loade vppon their battered crests, renting their armor, and mangling their flesh, vntill the Gyant slipt his bodie aside, to auoyde a blowe that Don Celindo let flie at him, reentring with a strong poynt with all his strength.
This offer of the Gyants got him no lesse then the victorie: for the inhumane wretch mist his thrust, and running the sword betwéen his armes, it slid down the armor, bringing the Gyants head vpon Don Celindos horse neck, inclining it downwards, who séeing him so neare, and not omitting so good opportunitie, strooke him on the helme with his sword hilts, ouerbearing him on that side he most declined, which was the occasion of his fall from his horse, and thinking to haue stayed himselfe, thrust one leg so farre into the stirrope, that when he would, he could not draw it foorth: whereat the Gyant noting his disgrace, drew his dagger, minding to cut it, but so vnfortunate he was, that somewhat annoyed with the former blow, he mortally wounded his horse bellie with the stroke, the which féeling it, with extreame pangs of death, fetching a Carreir, ranne about the field dragging his maister after him, where both ended at once, leauing Celindo thanking Fortune and his Gods for his good successe.
Through the gates of those Towers that befel them, entred he Claramant, and yet not with such hast as Claridianas Lord, that hauing séene Brauorants good hap, no longer delaying the time, fearing to be out gone, he past on til he came to a large yard of strange worke.
And round about it, there was a Gallery supported with twentie pillers of cleare Christall.
In the midst of it, stood a faire Fountaine, distilling water through diuers pipes, incompassed with Rose Trées, and other Odoriferous flowers.
On the top of the Fount, there was a rich and precious Armor of inestimable value, lying vppon a Table of siluer, with twelue féete of gold, whereat hung a braue sword.
At the entrance to the yard, stood a reasonable Piller of Brasse, wheron was written certaine words with Letters of Rubies.
No further would Trebatios eldest sonne passe, til he had read the scrowle, containing thus.
What Knight soeuer would ende the Aduenture, it behooues him ere he passe farther, to win these Armes, for considering the keepers, he shall haue need of them: But if his courage failes to do it, let him go on, for the passage is free.
So great pleasure and liking he conceiued of the armor, that although he had not intended to prosecute the aduenture, hee would haue spent a thousand liues to obtaine them, such was his valour.
Then couering himselfe with his shield, and vnsheathing his sword, hee entered the yarde, and going towards the Fountaine, he saw it guarded with so horrible a Serpent, able to affray any but Alphebo.
Shee was of a speares length, and a brace in breadth.
Foure feete she had, and two armes, armed with nayles of stéele, a handfull long: and téeth too of that kinde.
Of these Serpents, do ancient writers make mention, to be dull, heauie, and drowsie: insomuch, that no small noise will easily awaken them.
while stood the Emperor still, to sée if she would rise: but noting her slouthfull sléepe, he went more neare her, greatly wondring at her horred fiercenesse, misdoubting humane strength against so terrible a monster.
But his heroicke brest, beeing vnacquainted with any feare, recommended his safetie to the supreme King of Kings, and with his sword strooke the vgly beast on her defensiue scales, whereat, with hellish horror she awaked.
Against her went he when she being on her féete, with her scaly tayle, she strooke him so fierce a blowe on his body, that the Gréeke staggering, had like to haue fallen, but that his backe stumbled at the Piller, where he stayed.
This much inraged the Emperor, who like a Bazeliske awaighted her, he auoiding an other stroke wherewith she approached him, and then he discharged his blade in all possible haste, vpon her ribbes: but it happened not as he thought, for the sword rebounded backe, vnable to batter her scales, at whose strength he much wondred: and being about to second a poynt, shee entered vpon him: raising aloft her armes.
Carelesse was not the warrior, and misliking her embracements, wreathed aside his body, and as she would haue closed, he turned his sword, and therewith cut away her hinder legges, making her fall flat on her buttockes, howling at the paine of her wound.
And lifting vp her truncke on her armes, swoong about her tayle, and hitting him on the shoulders, she felde him on his handes, and as hee rose, got holde of his Armour with her nailes, and (furious with paine) rent away halfe of his armor, and had not he bene warie to looke to himselfe, with her téeth shée had made an ende of him.
But he séeing halfe his body disarmed, and fearing a disastrous death, shooke himselfe from her, hauing two péeces of his armor sticking in her iawes, imbrued in his purple blood, that issued from the wounds she had made him.
There is no furie of Hyrcania, like to Claridianas Louer, séeing the yarde besprinckled with his blood, and himselfe vnarmed: that taking his sword in both hands, on the Serpents backe, he executed the brauest blowe that euer knight performed: for happening in the middest of her body, and the strong scales vnable to resist the sharpesse of the blade, guided by the best arme in the world, she was parted in two, and the gates of her life opened to entertaine the fréezing ayre of colde death.
Infinit deserued thankes rendered the Gréek to his Creator for the victorie: and taking off his torne Armour, hee went to the bubling Fountaine, and being vexed with thirst, drunke of the Christaline water, remaining as well and lustie, as if he were neither wounded nor had fought, blessing the water and he that made it.
But looking on the armes, hee sawe them to bee the richest hee had euer before séene.
They were of russet colour, full of white and redde stars, made of Dyamonds and Rubies, inchained one by an other, with knots of Golde.
In middest of it, was the picture of a Knight, naturally resembling the knight of the Sunne, when he maintained the bewtie of Lyndabrides, vnder the tytle of the knight of the Chariot, as the first part of this Historie remembred.
Hee was also mounted on a horse, the counterfeyt of Corneryno.
His power cannot be withstood, That hath horse, armes, and cause so good.
Slowe was not he to arme himselfe with these armes, and hauing in mind the libertie of Roselia, like a he passed through a doore he found in the yarde.
All this while, the furious Brauorant was not: idle for hauing ended his first battle, he entered the gate from whence the Gyant came forth.
Through Lymbo he thought he walked, so excéeding darke was his way.
great while did he grope about the wall on eyther side, to find
and issue from that dwelling, vntill he found a doore: the which, althogh it was of strongest steele, yet he quickly battered it with the pummell of his sword.
Forward he passed, and in the end, he found himselfe to be at the gate of a faire hall, in middest whereof, there stoode the confused picture of a mightie Gyant, made of Brasse, with a sword in one hand, and in the other, a bigge shéeld: and as the stoute Scythian would enter in, the Fantasmo made against him.
No whit at all was Cmpeons nephew afraid, yet stood in great co~fusion, not knowing in what maner to make his battle.
First arriued the Fantasmo, and with incredible force executed his blowe on Brauorant Helme: who hauing no shéeld to ward it, was constrained to set his knées and one hand to the ground.
poynt was seconded with so strong a thrust, that hitting him as he was disordered, it laid him along vpon his backe.
Vpon him went the Fantasmo, yet mist of his intent.
For the strong Scythian did cast his armes about his necke, felling him to the floore, and in the fal, being within his reach, he gaue him such a blow on the mishapen face with his fist, that therewith he rowled him along the ground: and rayfing himselfe, went against the vgly shape, that being vp did the like: but hee auoyding a blowe, with a floorish on high, he descended his cutting blade, paring away some of the shoulder, and halfe his arme.
Which no sooner was done, but that part turned into an vgly Gyant, who hauing a Mace of Iron in his hand, said.
Thinke not (fierce knight) thy strength able to end the aduenture, for all the vnited power of the vniuerse shall not frée thée from my hands.
Much amazed was the sterue sonne of Bramarant, séeing the Gyant before him, yet with most inuincible courage hee prepared himselfe for the Combat, and so comming towards him, offered to strike at his head, which made him lift his Clubbe to defend it.
But Brauorant withdrawing backe his strong arme, stepped in with his right legge, and ranne at him with a mightie thrust.
It cut all his Armour, and mortally wounded him on the belly.
Vnrecompenced went hee not away: for the Gyant swaying his Mace about, hee strooke him therewith on the breast, and felde him to the earth, but hee quickly rose, ready to burst with rage,
blaspheming against himselfe, from which passion he was put, by the approach of the Phantasmo that came to wound him.
But he scaping it, would turne his edge vpon him, but with the backe of his sword he strooke him on the helme, that it made him stagger a good way from thence, and then swifter then an Eagle, receiuing the Gyants blow on his blade, it cut his Mace of Iron cleane in two.
Which when Floralizas Louer spied, he closed with him, and crossing his legges with the others, he brauely tript him downe, felling him on his backe, and then he stabde his dagger into his brutish breast, making him belch forth his soule to him that long before that expected it.
Now could not the vallerous youth so cleanly go away with this good hap, but that he was hit on the helme a heauy blow by the Phantasmo, the fine temper thereof saued his life, yet was he in a traunce laid along.
On the shoulder the inchaunted shapelesse Picture seconded another, which made him tumble on the grounde, and as he went to thrust at him a furious poynt, he got on his féete, but so blinde with rage, that forgetting what had befallen, he tooke his sword in both ha~ds, and with the vtmost of his strength, he discharged it vpon his shoulder, diuiding the Phantasmo cleane in two.
He had scarce executed the blow, but the couragious Pagan repented him thereof, for each part of the accursed Phantasmo, turned to a mightie Lyon, whose ferocitie could not but haue feared any other saue Brauorant.
It amated the Pagan, yet not that he fainted, but with more brauery then in the beginning, held the point of his sword before him, letting the beasts come, whereof one thirsting for his praie, ranne vpon his sword, splitting his heart in two thereon.
The other assayled him on his left side, where finding no resistance, fastened his clawes on him: and although his Armor was strong, yet he pearst them, renting his flesh within, which but more kindled his fury, séeing his blood there shead, which til then had happened in no fight be fore.
Bramarants sonne would not immitate Sampson in that action, because it should not be said he followed the example, but rather performed an act no lesse memorable, for letting his sword hang by the Chaine at his wrist, he tooke the Lyon by the necke twixt his hands, and with incomparable strength choaked him, himself remaining both wounded, and with his Armor rent.
There is no ioy like to his, hauing ended that perillous Combat, and although he was weary, yet went he forward, fearing his companions would be before
No lesse famous were Claridianos battles: for vanquishing the kéepers of the first Castle, like a whirlewinde he past on, making staie at a litle narrow Lane, séeming to haue no end on no side.
Amazed was Archysiloras gallant, at the obscuritie thereof, yet he went on, and comming to the ende, vnawares he did tread in a hollow place, falling into a Vawte, filled with nothing but Wormes, and venemous Vermine.
It was but sixe yardes broade, and eight long: It yéelded no more light, then what issued at a litle casement, where he espied a verie olde man, swarter then Chimnies soothe, who with a hoarse voyce said.
In faith (braue knight) you haue got verie good company among those Wormes, on them you may execute your reuenge: but feare they wil first take it on you with their venome: and therfore your best way is not to strike them, if you wil not be slaine: for tis better to prorogue your life a litle, then nothing to enioy it.
Excéeding great was the Princes wrath, séeing himselfe so betraied into that pestilentiall Caue, and hauing vnderstood the Magitians words, blinde with rage he replied.
Small is the Conquest, got by such treachery, thus to betray any knight: which assures me, that he (which made this Inchauntment) was more inured to treasons then good déeds, séeing without battles, by vndesent stratagems, he prosecutes his diuellish intent and purpose.
Why then, that may sée how thy words will agrée with your déeds (said the infernal Coniurer) there be within that place, two beasts, to whom all the rest acknowledge their obedience.
Now if thou beest so hardie as to incounter with them, on their deaths depends thy libertie: else art thou for euer there inclosed.
Although extreame wrathful, yet glad in some respect, Trebatios Nephew answered.
am content to hazard my person in any daunger to issue hence, and for an instance thereof, shewe me the way must goe foorth, and then place the beasts there.
Be it so (returned the Magitian) and in yonder dark corner there is an iron King, the which if thou doest pluck at, thou shalt descry whence the beastes doo issue.
Slacke was not the Princely Gréeke to goe thither, and getting holde of the King, hée pluckt so hard, that drawing a Plancke from the Wall, hée fell backwardes, with it almost vppon him, but fearing the suddain comming of the beasts, he quickly got on his féete: when against him
His bodie was proportioned like a Beare, saue that he had a long Tayle, and crooked téethe, like Tuskes, and on his head, he had a horne neare a yarde long.
His armes were nothing differing from a mans, being footed lyke a Lyon.
In one hand he beare a Bowe readie bended, with a stéele Darte.
And in the other, he had a Chaine, which tyed a mightie Bazeliske.
Nothing daunted with the sight, was Claridiano, although a litle amated at theyr fiercenesse: but hauing an eye at the Darte, drawing his sword, and couering himselfe wel with his shield, he marched against the vgly mishapen Monster.
Who shooting his Darte, did make it flie swifter then lightning.
And then the Monster hauing so done, he let loose his Companion, marching both togither against the Prince.
He also incountred them, and méeting first with the Monster, he let flie at his head, striking away halfe his horne, with all his Iawes on that side.
Before he could second it, the Bazeliske with his stéely Bill, strooke him vnder his arme, that it made him stagger thrée or foure steppes, and stumbling on the wall, saued himselfe from falling.
In manifest daunger of his life was the Gréeke, for the wounded Monster roring with paine, closed with the Prince (ere he could recouer his last mischaunce) and casting his armes about him, would haue pluckt him backwards.
Here Alphebos sonne could no otherwise but doo the like, and hauing greater strength, and being more nimbler then the Monster, slipt one arme betwéene his legges, and hoysting him aloft, he flung him to the earth on his backe, and as he drew his Dagger to ende with him, the furious Bazeliske fluttering his winges, flewe on his shoulders, where with infernal fury, with his inchaunted Bill hée strooke the Prince on the head, that it made him loose his blowe and that good occasion, and with his helme clouen, felde him a toside.
In whiche season, the Monster rose, spitting fire through his hellishe mouth.
Straight did Claridianas sonne rise, but being halfe astonished of the blowe, the Monster had time to runne at his breast with his broken horne, which made him so recoyle backe, that he had much adoo to saue himselfe from a fall.
But what auailes it, all being for theyr worst: for the Prince (stifeled with rage) tooke his Dagger in his one hand, and not knowing what he did, aimed it at the Bazeliske that came flying at him.
Straighter then the Monster shot his Darte, he flung it, and hitting him in the breast, it staied not til it cleft his heart in two, and flying out at his backe, fel with the beast at once, that with a hiddeous shrike stird no more.
This death greatly displeased the Monster, who bellowing, and spitting sulphure flames, leapt to the Prince that set his swords point against him, the which he tooke betwéene his tushes, and rising on foote, would haue pluckt by the Princes skirt, but that he saued it with his shield, through which, as if it had bene of some composed clay, he thrust his clawes into it.
The haughtie warriour did let it go, and raising his right hand, (letting his sword hang by the Chain, the which he had alreadie drawn from the Monsters mouth) he would néedes make the Magitian witnesse his vnequalled strength, for closing his armed fist, he gaue the deformed Monster such a buffet, as he strewed all his face with his owne braines, making his eyes flie from the head, and he himselfe bellowing, fall dead at his féete: to the Princes excéeding ioy, though not to the Magitians, that woulde not any longer staie in the Windowe.
Whereat the victorious youth without farther delaie, fearing to be outgone by the rest, past the doore he had so dearely discouered.
Admirable were these battles of the second Castles, that hapned to Alphebo, Brauorant, and Claridiano: yet nothing inferior to them, was heroicke Claramants, for hauing done with the first, he stepped through the Gate, receiuing innumerable blowes, not knowing by whom they were giuen: making him set his hands and knées vnto the ground: neyther his shield nor terrible Axe auailed, not séeing his aduersary.
This so tormented our seconde Mars, that he beganne with all his strength to strike on either side, still kéeping his way forwarde along a fayre Gallery, and béeing neare to the end thereof, the blowes ceast, at the opening of the wall whence came foorth a wilde Sauadge.
In either hand he did leade a Centaure, bounde with a Chaine, bearing in their hands long Cemitors.
The haughtie Warrior not fearing them, with his shielde about his arme, and raising his Axe with the other, went towards them.
At first the Sauadge met him with an iron bat, leauing the Centaures behinde him: and at the Princes Helme, he let driue a terrible blowe.
Claramant lifted his shield to take it thereon, the which was driuen with such fury to his head, that he could scarce keepe himselfe from falling.
With admired spéede the Centaures aymed theyr Semitors at him: And then he brauely turned his Axe, striking one vpon his brest, felling him in a sound, and with a counterbuffe he cut away the others arme with his Semitor.
Vnrepaid could not Bryanas sonne scape, for the Sauadge séeing his Centaures so intreated, discharged his bat vpon his shoulder, with such monstrous strength, that maugre his vallour, it strooke him down, falling vpon the astonished Centaure, that then would rise, who séeing him so neare, did cast his strong armes about, crushing him so hard that he could not stirre, giuing the Sauadge occasion againe to raise his bat, discharging it directly vpon the Princes head.
But he séeing it descend, with the vtmost of his strength, on the sudden got from betwéene them, some halfe yarde away, and so auoyded the Batte, striking the Centaure so venturous a blowe on the breast, that he opened the Portall of his heart, with hideous horror, to vent forth his liuing breath.
Incomparable was Claramants content of this great good successe, yet was it not sufficient to expell his wonderfull excéeding rage, which made him as nimble and swift as a Roe, get on his legges, euen when the Sauadge séeing the ill hap of his stroke, did discharge another.
Lightly did Claramant shunne it, and so the Batte finding no resistance, ranne one halfe of it into the grounde, and before he could fetche it out againe, the Prince with a downeright blowe easily cut asunder both his armes, and turning againe vppon the Centaure, with another mightie blowe, he claue him from the head to the brest.
And so leauing him dead, and the wilde Monster roaring with paine, he would haue passed to enter the breach the beasts had made in
the wall, but he saw it close, not knowing by what meanes, and ignoring the cause, with raging furie, returned on the Sauadge, with his axe wounded him in the middle, parting his brutish body in two: at the instant the wall opened, whereat thanking his Gods, hee went thorowe the doore, fearing his stay might yéelde some aduantage to his companions, the which he would not acknowledge Mars to haue ouer him.
No lesse strong then venturous, was Don Celindos Combat, for when he saw the Gyants disgrace, hee valiantly put himselfe through a Caue, and being at the end thereof, comming to a great gate, he did tread in a hole, falling: yet happily as it fell out.
For before the gate, there was a Vault, couered with a boorde made lesse then the mouth thereof, and fastened to a round pole, whose endes crossed the hole at one side, and so treading harde on the boorde, it ouerweighed the one side downewards, whereby he fell in: but the holes mouth béeing narrowe, and his sword hanging by his side, in the fall it crost vpon the hole, and so he hung thereat, ouer knées in water.
This vnthought mischance, daunted Meridians sonne, yet recommending himselfe vnto his Gods, he lifted vp his armes, and raysing his body, cast it flat ouer the boorde, and as light as he could, with much adoo, he got out of the hellish place, thinking himselfe now to haue new risen from death.
He had scarce gone thence, when he heard the voyces of certaine men, and listening, he heard them say: Come, come, let vs goe apace, and wee shall sée how well the Rat canne swim.
It was not long deferred him: for through the same gate that opened into a garden, there issued sixe swaines, euery one with his Bill in his hand.
More destruction makes not the hungrie woolf among the tender lambs, then Floralizas brother of those villaines, saying.
Sée here you villaines, the Rat scaped from your trappe, defend your selues from him.
By this he had already cleft one to the waste, and ran an other through the body and heart.
Amazed were they to sée that the knight had scaped thir trap, and so trusting to their aduantage, they made him sometime kisse the ground with his hands, and then with his head: yet all did but increase his rage: For Alycandros Nephew being abashed to let them hold out so long, so swoong his sword among them, that hée felde one
dead, an other with shoulder cut: an other without legges: and the last, armelesse, and all wanting their soules, hee sent them poste vnto hell: finishing with theyr liues, the ende of the enterance of the second Castle, and staying no longer there, he entered into the Garden.
Now is the time (admired Ladies, Goddesses of those soules that adore you) to lend me a little pittie, (the ornament of your sexe) equalling your magnificent bountie, with your rare and diuine bewties, suffering the sunnie rayes of your swéete fauours, so to strengthen my harsh quill, (although immeritable) that may expresse the fiercest battell that euer Mortalles heard of, worthy to bee atchieued by none but the mightie Alphebo, deseruer of the worlds greatest Trophies.
Who hauing put on the best and richest Armour in the Vniuerse, tooke his shéeld about his Arme, and with his vnsheathed sword, put himselfe through the gate in the yarde, staying in a roome darker then Erebus, and from the doore thereof, issued sulphire flames of fyre, making it resemble hell it selfe: and looking within the doore, he saw a great Hall, all of a fyre: wherein there was a huge Sallamander, as big as any horse.
She had a great head, fashioned like an Eagle, with a stéele Bill, with clawes of the same mettall, of excessiue length.
Moreouer she had a long tayle like a Serpents, and did nothing but voyd volleys of fyre through her mouth.
Much amazed was the Emperour at the straunge fashion of the beast, especially, not knowing how to make his battell: for if he enters the roome, so great is the fyre, that it is like to consume him: and therefore he made a noise, to try if she would come forth, and so he strooke his sword against the gate, at which noise she arose, but would not moue: and being vp, looked at the doore, yet sturred not, and did cast more fyre from her mouth, then a smithes double bellowes rayseth with blowing.
Many times was Alphebo about to follow after her, but iudging it ouerhardie boldnesse, hee would detaine himselfe: yet calling to mind his companions might out go him, he thought the danger too small.
So drew he forth his dagger, and stepping to the doore, hee threw it at
the Sallamander, and the marke being so great, and aymed by such an arme, he missed her not, but thorow her ribbes he made it flye vp to the hylts, launching out her gorie blood.
The wound did not harme her, for licking it with her tongue, it healed, but yet it put her into such paine, that any other but the Emperor would haue bene affrighted, hearing her hideous howling, and hauing an eye at the causer of his extreame paine, with two iumps shee was with him.
Backe stepped the Gréeke, thinking shee woulde haue followed out, but hee rested amazed, séeing shee did not, but kept still within, roring like a Bull.
Well did the Trebizonian Lord note it, and therefore taking his shéeld about his arme, and commending himselfe to his God, with his sword he marched against the beast, and offering to strike her, she béeing watchfull, turned about her scaly tayle, wherewith she made him loose his blowe, and recoyle thrée steps backe.
But being angred therewith, he returned with more aduice then in the beginning, and hollowing his body at her tayle that came again in the same maner, he thrust a poynt at her brest, running his sword a handfull into it.
Shee shryked most horribly féeling the wound, and in the instant did spit so much fire, that some ouertaking him and getting into his Helme, it so heated him, as he thought his face to be a meere cole.
Two steppes did Alphebo goe backe to auoyde the fire, whence hee sawe that the beast touching the wound with his tongue, it presently healed, and shee instantly set her selfe at the very edge of the doore.
It greatly confounded the Emperours sences, to sée he could not deuise how to vanquish her, and imagining her vertue consisted in licking her wounds, he determined to strike her on the head where her tongue might not reach it: wherfore couering himselfe with his shéeld, he went to her that expected him at the doore.
He offered to strike her on the brest with a point, which the Sallamander fearing, shrunke her body backe, omitting the vse of her tayle.
So the Gréek Mars stepped forward with his hinmost leg, letting his sword fly at her head.
He thoght it wold not lesse then cleaue her, yet found he such resistance, that glauncing downe it wounded her a little on the necke, which she straight curing with her tongue, it nothing hurt her at all.
This madded the sonne of Trebatio, especially to sée how little it
auailed him to wound her: so vnresolued what to doo, hee concluded to receiue a blowe, and then follow her, to execute an other at his pleasure on her head, hoping her cure wold not be so certaine there.
Thus determined once againe, he went to the doore, where she carefully awaighting him, and séeing him so neare, ere he could strike her, she cast her clawes vpon him, and gryping him hard with them, she not onely frustrated his blowe, but plucked him so strongly, that the good Emperour could not so soone get from her, whereby of force, he was constrained to enter in, where scarce shée had him, but she grapled him about ye middle with her stéeled tallents, that had he not then had on the best Armour in the Vniuerse, without doubt hee had there perished.
But though he had escaped her sharpe clawes, yet hee could not auoyde the cruell burning heate of the enchaunted fyre that then incompassed him on all sides, chiefly that which issued from the Sallamanders mouth.
It excéedingly tormented the Gréeke, séeing himselfe so burne without remedie, and his Armour to glowe like a bright cole of fyre.
And so with that furie, (hauing his death before his eyes) nimbler then a cat, leaping out of a fyre, he tooke holde of the Sallamanders body, and straining his stre~gth beyond his power, féeling his flesh broyle, hee ouerturned her to the ground, and still maintaining his fiercenesse, he brought her to the doore, and although she there striued most to withstand him, yet hee hurled her out of the burning lodging, where on the sudden shee dyed, euen as the fish wanting the water that nourisheth it.
With his dagger he went to wound her, but séeing she styrred not, he went and found her dead, wherfore he gaue his Creator due thanks for so great a victorie: and without more stay, hee disarmed himselfe, for all his Armour was of a very fyre.
Hauing done, hee felt himselfe so wearie and tyred, as euer before at any time hee hadde beene: and sitting downe vpon the Sallamander, he tarried the cooling of his armes.
While this cruell combat lasted, the haughtie Pagan, both Louer and subiect of the gallant Floraliza, had not béene idle, who abashed at his long staying in winning the passage of the second Castle, went along through the hall, where he did find the Fantasmo, whose ende brought him into a fayre gréene plot, in middest
whereof there was a Tower, circled about with a high stéepie wall, which had no gate nor signe of entrance.
Amazed at this sight, the stout Schythian looked to the top of the Tower, where he saw a well accomplished Knight, clad all in rich Armour, who with an angrie voice said.
What thinkest thou knight? it is in vaine to séeke an entrance hither, for there is none: vnlesse thou wilt créepe vp the wal, which is impossible, and were it to be done, seest thou not am here to forbid it? but were it not so dangerous, it is graunted to none, nor none shall ascend hither.
In termes of answere would not the vntaymed youth procrastinate the time, but rather with greatest haste disarmed himselfe, kéeping onely his Helme on his head, and his shéeld the which he cast at his backe, and his sword hanging by his side, hee drew forth his dagger (and beeing desirous to make his valour knowne vnto the Knight) hee strooke it into the wall, and with both his hands plucking out some stones, hee clamored vp, and as he ascended, so hee stucke his dagger, for thereon sometimes hee sette his féete, whilest hee made his hands sure to mount.
Amazed was the knight, to sée with what nimblenesse and dexteritie he did it, but fearing to be assaulted on high, he flung down a great stone from the top.
It fell vpon Brauorants Helme, which with a sore fall, halfe sencelesse it tumbled him to the earth.
Neuerthelesse, within a while hee recouered himselfe, being fiercer then any Lyon, an reuiling himselfe and his Gods, which others adored, he returned to prosecute his way: but with great care and watch to escape from an other fall, if the Knight played as he did before.
Who much delighted to sée with what courage Campeons Nephewe clymed vppe.
Hee so occupied himselfe in gazing on him, that Brauorant had leaue to ascend so high, that when he would haue hurled an other, hee had no time to do it, for while he fetched it, which was some two yards from that place, the Pagan had got to the toppe, which being loath to loose, he brauely leaped in.
His sterne presence somewhat feared the knight, but séeing him disarmed, he recouered strength: yet it auaileth him litle: for Brauorant so charged him with a blow, that it cut his shéeld cleane in two, and descending on his Helme, made him set his knées to the ground.
It angred the Knight to bee so vsed, who stepping in with one foote, did let flie at him a strong poynt.
By wresting aside his body, Mars his Competitor did shun it, and so suddenly closed with him, that standing but on one leg, he feld him on his backe, euen when the knight drew forth his dagger, the which the Pagan being vnable to preuent, was enforced to let him go, who got vp, and more irefull then a Bazeliske, going nearer, gaue him such a blowe on the helme, yet not able to penetrate, there it glaunced downe, wounding him a little on the shoulder.
Now was the furious Pagan mad to sée his aduersaries blade réeke with his lukewarme blood: whereat detracting no more time, escaping an other thrust, againe he closed with him, and presently taking him by the middle hoysting him aloft, hee instantly tumbled him headlong downe the Tower: where on the ground, with the extreame waight of his Armour, hee was broken in many péeces, and at the instant, the Tower vanished away with such a noyse, as if the earth were ouerwhelmed: so that Brauorant found himsefe beneathe where his Armour lay, and the dead Knight neare vnto him.
There he armed himselfe, getting through a Gate hee had espied.
No lesse victorious remained Archysiloras Louer of the aduenture of the last porche.
For hauing slaine the infernall beasts in the Vault, he went in at the opened wall he had descried, and crossing thorow a faire Orchard, he came at last vnto a big strong Castle, shut with brazen gates, whereon were made certaine Letters of Emeralds: the which he thus read.
What knight so euer would end the aduenture, let him winde his horne, and the gates shall be opened.
Hee ended, making all the field resound with the eccho of the Hornes shrill sound: whereat the gates flying open, there issued a mightie vgly Draggon, shaped almost like the Sallamander.
Doubtlesse any other saue Claridiano would haue feared his aspect: but hee that was borne to fight, as if he were a weake knight, taking his Shéeld about his arme, went towards him with his sword drawne.
He warded a huge stroke with his scaly Taile: it strooke his shielde from his arme, and had almost felde him.
It inraged Claridiano who stifly setling himselfe on his féete, thrust a poynt at the hellish beast, it had like to haue cost him his life, for the Dragon escaping it, as hée past, did strike him so terrible a stroke, backwardes vppon his gorget, that he was felde on his face.
Then would the fierce Dragon haue closed with him, but hée found Claridiano nothing remisse, who raging mad, with a quicke leape atoside, auoyded his fury, and turning vppon him, with his good sword he cut away his legges by the knées.
With dreadfull crying shrikes, the woundes beast draling his bodie on the grounde, would haue taken the Prince betwéene his pawes, but being wrathfull, and this his last battle, with a downeright blowe hée cleft a péece of his head, and with a fierce thrust, cut his heart cleane in two, felling him dead at his féete, and so past on, desirous to ende the aduenture.
At one instant finished Claridiano and Claramant theyr Battailes, although Trebatios sonnes was somewhat longer, because it was more troublesom.
For hauing slain the sauadge the Centaures, hée paced that way they came, til he issued into a delightfull Plaine, where he was incountred by a gallant knight in hose and doublet, who said.
So feared are Theseus Armes (Syr knight) in this habitation, that dreading the losse of the Castle, am inioyned the Combat in this maner, and if you intend to passe on, you must doo the like: and therefore presently vnarme you.
The Gréeke not refusing it, did straight put off his Armour: to whome the knight deliuered a Rapier and Dagger, with these words.
(With these weapons must you defend your selfe, valiant knight).
am content, replied Claramant, and taking them, prepared for the fight.
The Gréeke first setling himselfe, did with his Dagger strike away his aduersaries point, and with his Rapier wounded him with a thrust on the breast, and drawing back his leg, controwled the others Rapier, that came directly to his head.
The wound much gréeuing the knight, made him respect no tricks of Art, but ranne against the prince, who fearing his vnaduised desperate comming, crost his rapier against the other, and so staied his fury.
but he burning with ire to be so preuented, thought to haue slaine him with his Dagger, imagining Claramants care was onely in the preuention of the rapyer, but it was not so: for he stretching out his arme further, did first stabbe his dagger into the knights shoulder, which made him forgoe his purpose: wherevpon the Prince hauing opportunitie to drawe backe his sword, did it, and suddenly with a strong poynt wounded the knight mortally in the flancke, which altogither made him faint.
The wounded knight séeing his date of life expyred, dispairing of remedie, he hurled his dagger at him, with the vtmost of his strength, that he miraculously scaped an vntimely death: for Claramant chancing to take it on his hilts, the poynt thereof was stayed at the Pummell, and had it not there found that resistance, it could not but haue run it vp to the hils into his body.
Amazed was the Gréeke Prince, iudging that, the moment of his byrth, but going to take his reuenge of the knight, hee saw him splitted on his owne rapyer: for séeing himselfe deadly wounded, and that hee could not escape with life, chose rather to bee his owne executioner, then the Prince should tryumphe ouer his death at his hands.
Ioying at the victorie of so daungerous a Combat, hee prosecuted his way.
No aduantage had Claramant ouer Don Celindo, who ended his fight as soone as he: for hauing slaine the swaynes, and passed the Garden, hee came vnto a greene Meade, where a knight gallantly mounted, expected the battle: not farre from him there stood a Piller, whereto a luftie courser was tyed, the which Alicandros Nephew imagining to be for him, he did quickly back, and taking a strong knottie Launce that he also there found, eyther parted from the other, to take his carreire, and valiantly made their strong encounters.
In middest of the shéelde did Don Celindo hit the Knight, and clearely piercing it, thrust him so strongly, that breaking his saddle gyrtes, he tumbled him from his horse.
The knight strooke Don Celindo on his Beauer, which so astonished him, that he let goe his horse bridle, who féeling his head at libertie, eleuated himselfe so high, that both fell downe, yet Don Celindo perceiuing it, before the fall, did quickly leape from his backe.
With shields about their armes and swords on high, the two braue warriors met.
With a furious thrust did Don Celindo first wound his aduersary, which made him giue backe thrée steppes.
But he presently returned, and gaue him such a blow on the helme, that he thoght himselfe in heauen, so many starres he sawe about his head, and with a counterbuffe on the shoulder, he had almost felde him.
Like a rauening Lyon became Floralindas sonne, and offering to strike him on the head, the knight repaired thither with his shield.
It was the cause of his ouerthrow: for Don Celindo not minding it, with a point wounded him mortally on the brest, pearcing all his Armor, and then with mightie strength turning his sword to the others head, he cut away halfe his helme, with a péece of his scull.
Howling and shriking with the wound, the knight turned his backe, and fled through a faire Gallery.
After him went Don Celindo, ouertaking him in a great plaine, where he sawe foure great Arches inchaste with precious stones, held vp with eight mightie Christal Pillers.
There did Don Celindo assaile the knight, euen when a bewteous Lady most richly attyred confronted him.
He was astonished at her sight, thinking he sawe his deare Rosiluera.
Stay your hand braue knight (said the Lady) and doo not execute your wrath on him that yéelds you the victorie.
cannot (most soueraigne Princesse replied he, amazed to sée her there) but satisfie your content, obeying what ere you shall impose on me: as he only borne to do your seruice: yet is my poore soule tormented with griefe, that this commaund is no greater.
It is too much (answered she) for her that hath showne you no kindnesse: and so the craftie Damzel taking him by the hande, placed him vnder the last Arche, leauing him there inchaunted, without iudgement or vnderstanding, sauing how to accomplish her wil, who leauing him there said.
Here must you remaine Syr knight, and defend the entrance gainst all the world, if all the worlde shall come.
Be assured (Lady) wil (replied the inchaunted youth) and first Ile leaue to breathe, then desist from defending the Arche.
Away went the Lady along the Arches, when the furious Brauorant came thitherward, hauing put on his Armour.
He stept backe as one in a traunce, imagining he behelde his Floraliza, into that shape she had transmuted her selfe.
The Pagan so admyred her sight, as he was strooke dumbe, but she reuiued him thus.
Come with me braue knight, for we greatly néede your strength.
Leade the way (diuine Ladie, replied he) for it is my felicitie to loose my life for your bewtie.
Leading him by the hand, the deceitfull Ladie left him inchaunted vnder the third Arche, saying.
Courteous Knight, this Arche must you defend, with the vtmost of your vallor.
Leaue that care to me, for wil at least shall not want, if strength forsakes me not.
At another Gate by this, appeared Archysiloras Louer, to him she went, representing ye Quéen of Lyra.
Whom (to be short) she also inchaunted in the second, and in the first did the like by Claramant, hauing on the presence, and countenance of the famous Lyndabrides, whom he by report alreadie began to fancie.
Then like the winde she vanisht away, yet ere she went, she commuunded them on their liues, they should not go out of the Arches, vnlesse they would imbrace theyr deaths.
And so leauing a scroll vpon a Piller, she left them.
How the Emperour Alphebo ended the famous Inchauntment of Roselia, and what else happened.
SO great was the care that those wise men, Lyrgandeo, Artemidoro and Nabato had ouer the Gréekes and theyr Empire, that by theyr Arte had reached to the knowledge, how that memorable Monarchy would be brought to the point of an vtter ouerthrow, and perpetuall desolation: wherefore so entierly affecting her Princes, (as this great Historie hath amply mentioned) for their Loues, they reuolued their bookes, to know the cause, and causer of such bloodie warres: which they found to be the two Princesses, Lyriana of Nyquea, and Roselia of Rome: whereupon they resolued to Inchaunt them, beginning first with Lyriana, within the sea Tower, as hath bene related.
And séeing that the Romane Princesse was left, they ioyned themselues togither, in the making of this Inchantment the strongest euer séene, for while she was so kept, her Father should not knowe what had happened betwéene her and Don Eleno of Dacia, nor should she at his hands require reuenge against him.
As they did determine it, so did the wise Magitians performe it, making it far stronger then Lyrianas, for they intended to kéepe her long time there, vntil some good order were taken about the Gréekes affaires.
Againe, they resolued to haue Lyriana disinchaunted, and her Nuptialls with the Brytaine Prince solemnized, hoping it wold be a means to reconcile the Souldan of Nyquea, giuing him so great a Prince as Rosabel to be his sonne in lawe.
They would not do so by Roselia, because she could not be wedded with whome she had imprinted in her heart.
But the peruerse Selagio (by meanes of Lupercio hunting after reuenge for the death of Fangomadon (whom Rosicler flew, as in the first Chapter of the first booke of this third part is exprest) would néeds procure the libertie of this Lady, with Arbolinda of Scotland, that accompanied her: for which purpose, in a Barke he drew Brauorant and Don Celindo, from the Fléete: doing the like by Alphebo, directing also Claridiano and Claramant thither: where all of them performed such déeds in armes as is specified, and worthie of such great Princes, slaying all the kéepers of the Castles.
But the wise men fearing the two Ladies libertie, as the last refuge of their hopes, erected these foure Arches, there to Inchaunt those mightie Warriors, that none might end the aduenture, they being the sole Pillers of humane strength.
Twentie yeares they purposed the Inthauntment should stand, finding by theyr Art, that after that time Greece would flourish with most happinesse, by a contracted League, with the greatest Potentates of the world.
But the supreame King of Kings, hauing otherwise disposed of those affayres, frustrated (as you shall sée) theyr toyles, bringing thither at that time Alphebo, sole Phoenix in armes, vallor, and all bountie.
So much the longer he staied, vntil his armor was coole, and then buckling it on, past the last Portall, comming to the Arches, at the very instant the Lady had done inchaunting the knights, and lighting on the Piller, he thus read the inscription.
Let none though he be Mars in Armes, pretend to passe forward, for what is done, is nothing comparable to what is to do, seeing he must Combat with the Myrrors of Chiualry, Claramant, Claridiano, Brauorant, and Don Celindo.
The Trebezonian Lord did feele his blood fréeze in his bodie, hearing his strong Companions were there inchaunted, and among them his sonne, for whose sake he greatly dreaded the fight, fearing some ill mischaunce either to him or his sonne: for he déemed none equalled Claridiano.
Oh, Claridianas Lord wisht his sonne thence, and in his place the whole world: for that power vnited, he not so much did doubt.
As he was thus considering with himselfe, he heard a voyce (that by Selagios procurement said) What doubts thou Illustrious Emperor? Consider it is not worthie thy great valor to refuse these Combats, for theyr endes shal conclude the famousest déeds in armes that was euer heard of.
Altogither did these words put him from his pensiuenesse, iudging his delaie to procéed from base cowardise: wherfore as swift as a Roe, he went towards the first Arche, when he heard the noyse of certaine voyces, that said.
Leaue, leaue, this accursed enterprise, thou mightie Alphebo, for with the blowes thou giuest to one knight, thou woundest Bryanas soule, and with those thou dischargest on the other, thou doest split her heart, to whom thou owest all content: thy deare Clatidiana we meane.
Backe stept the Emperor, not in feare of the Battles, for his heroicke mind was not vsed to it, but to haue vnderstood those words, yet supposing they were vttered only to threaten him, rather desiring to die (oh admirable courage) then to be tainted with cowardise, recommending himself to his true God, he began to march towards the first arch, being nothing hurt by the Inchantment, for the vertue of his King defended it, the which he alwayes woare, wherewith he freed his Father from Lyndarazas imprisonment, where he atchiued immortall fame.
He had no sooner entred it, but like a blazing Commet, Claramant issued to entertaine him, (vnknowne to his brother) by reason of the inchantment.
At that time a gallant window opened, where appeared two ladies, whose bewties stained Venus in her pride, there come
At length togither met the two haughtie combattants, either receiuing the other, with the puissance of their strong terrible blowes.
They discharged them on the toppe of their heads so rigorously, that squadrons of sparkles flew from their helmes.
Either did set one knée on the ground, bowing their heads with such low congies, as if they had knowne themselues to be brothers.
Both remained angrie and fearefull of the others strength: so rising, they gaue beginning to the hammering of their bodies, as if it were a battell of twentie knights.
The Emperors new wonne armor, did well defend his flesh from the cutting of Theseus axe.
Neuerthelesse, within an houre of their fight, he felt his bodie sorely brused, yet he comforted himselfe, séeing his aduersarie besmeared with his owne blood, hauing his armor rent and torne in many places, but yet as lustie as when he beganne, and raising his axe, he laide on the others shoulder.
The inpenetrable armes he may thanke for his life, the which they saued, though not him from touching the earth with his hands.
And so the valiant Prince seeing this good occasion, closed with him, that either cast his strong armes about the other, to procure eithers aduantage.
Soone got Claramant ouer the Emperor, because he assaulted him with a suddaine aduised charge.
But Claridianos Louer hauing recouered his foyle, made him loose his ground, and so ouerturned him of one side, that crossing his legge with his, he tript his brother, who fell vnder him: yet as swift as an Eagle he got vp, and grappling togither, they tumbled vp and downe the paued earth.
Where séeing they could not so vanquish one another, let go, repairing to their weapons, with such mightinesse heauie blowes wounding their bodies, that none saue they in al the world, could suffer them: yet did not they faint, nor loose no whit of their fierce courage, whose furie being throughly heated, séemed to increase their strength and ardinent, becomming so nimble and quicke in assaulting and retiring, offending, and defending, that their féete séemed to be winged.
Greatly did Alphebo wonder at his aduersaries fiercenesse, iudging him one of the best in the vniuerse, calling to remembrance the battell he had in Constantinople with his brother Rosicler, about the Princesse Lyndabrides.
He could not deuise how to get from him that arch, supposing his victorie consisted thereon.
Committing himselfe to God, and trusting to his forces, auoyding a thrust, he closed with Claramant, and before he could preuent it, he hoysed him from the ground, who vnable to forbid it, he carried out of the arch, but with excéeding labour, for Claramant with the vtmost of his power striued to let it.
He was no sooner thence, when as one dead he remained in the Emperors armes, who laying him downe, imagining hee would reuiue with the ende of the aduenture, he past that, till he entred the second arch, where against him, came the Mirror of courtesie fortitude, the magnanimious Claridiano.
Almost did his father knowe him, by the maiesticke gate comelynesse wherewith he made against him, giuing him so suddain a blow, that ere he repaired to the defence, hee seconded two thrusts, which sorely vexed Trebatios sonne, making him stagger thrée steppes back, and before he recouered himselfe, he gaue him a downe right blow on the helme, which made him sée many millions of firie sparkes.
It greatly inraged the péerelesse Alphebo, who séeing himselfe so handled, forgetting that he was his father, and he his sonne, did most terribly discharge his rich blade vpon his shield.
It yéelds no defence against the best arme in the world, for in two péeces it was throwne to the ground, and descending to the helme, finding there more resistance, it made his head bend with an awfull congey due to his authoritie, and kisse the earth with his hands, and as he rose, with a strong poynt he was ouerturned to the ground.
Long was he not so, but rising like the winde, blinde with rage, he tooke his sword in both hands, discharging it on his fathers shield, the which resisted the edge, was strooke with such might against his helme, that he thought the firmament was within.
With his knées on the ground he so remained astonished, till the sound of another blowe vpon his shoulder awakened him, to stay himselfe with his hands from falling.
Neuer did Alphebo féele himselfe more chollericke, nor furious, nor neuer by one battle so indaungered: but fearing to be ouercome, with madding rage he went against him he tendred as his soule, and on his waste gaue him a most mightie blow.
It made him incline his bodie that way, for cutting his armor, it wounded him alittle, sprinkling the ground with his crimson blood.
With a counterbuffe the Emperor returned, hitting him on his
vpwards bounded the sword, falling on the buckles of his helm, it cut them all, making it flie from his head.
With admiration did the Trebizonian Lord gaze on his picture, in such carelesse manner, that Claridiano had time to strike him at his pleasure on the middest of his precious helme, and straining the vtmost of his strength, he felled him downe, making the blood gush from the closings of his helme.
With more eagernesse doth not the soring hawk seizeon his pray, then Claridiano closed with his father, and casting his armes about him, thought to choke him betwéene them, at such time as the fierce Emperor returned to himselfe.
Oh, then did hee wish to haue any other then Claridiano betwéene his armes, (I, though it were the God of battels himselfe) to inflict on him the deserued punishment for such vsance, the which hee could not now do, vnlesse he should powre vengeance on himselfe.
But hauing good hold on him, with some trouble at length hee lifted him from the ground, and with violent striuing, opposing his greatest forces against his sonnes resistance, with blood gushing from his face, he carried him out of the arch: and leauing him euen like Claramant, hee felt his bodie neuer wearier in all his life.
while hee sate him downe at the foote of the same arch, to rest himselfe, and putting off his helme, hee wyped his bloodie face: but with the sight of the two Ladies in the window, whom he iudged to bee Roselia and Arbolinda, remembring their fréedome, he rebuckled on his helme, and marched to the third arch, where Brauorant, the flower of Pagans strength, incountred him with a strong poynt.
On his shield did the Emperor receiue it, against which the sword bending, forced him two steppes backe.
Another seconded the Pagan on his breast, making him bende his bodie backewards.
And comming vppon him with the third, Trebatios sonne gaue way vnto the furious poynt, which finding no stay, it drewe the hardy Scythian after it.
Whom Alphebo following, strooke him on the flancke, and vnable to cut his armor, he brused his flesh within.
This blowe chafed the fierce Pagan, who like a Basseliske, with Mars his strength, did let flie at him a mightie blowe.
On his shield did the Emperor take it, the which was strooke so against his helme, making it thunder like the stormie heauens.
And then hée gaue him a cruell thrust, that had not his armor béene the best in the world, he could not but haue incurred mortall perill.
The Gréekes respected no trickes of defence being so handled: wherefore like winters hayle, he charged the Pagan with his blowes in such sort, that hee rested amazed at the Emperors fiercenesse, yet fainted not his shewen valor in the beginning, though his owne blood had besmeared his armor, whose inchauntment was not of force against the cutting of Alphebos sword.
About this time, the Gréeke with all his puissance, gaue him a blow on his helme, whose force greatly inforced him back, which occasioned the Emperor to execute his intent, for noting with what blinde eager furie the Scythian came against him, the pollitick Lord returned back by little and little, euen to the first Arch.
So Brauorant thinking hée did it for feare, hastily followed him, and beeing almost out of the Arches, he heard a voyce that said: Returne, returne, renowned Brauorant, and remember Floralizas command: go not out of the first arch, for if thou doest, thou art but dead.
Great was his affection towardes that Ladie, hearing himselfe called by her owne name, amazedly turned his head, supposing she was there.
Which happie occasion Bryanas sonne would not loose, for watching such opportunitie, with one stride he ioyned with him, hoysting his bodie in the ayre, and béeing neare out of it, maugre the Pagans strength, he threw him foorth, leauing him as one dead.
Infinit thankes did the Gréeke render vnto God for this victorie, and without longer stay, he paced to the last arch, kept by Alicandros Nephew, with whom hee had one of the brauest battels in the world: for the aduantage the Emperour had ouer him in strength, the other supplied by being fresh, and he wearie and tired.
It so pleased the bewteous Roselia (being one of those that looked on them) to sée with what dexteritie and valor Don Celindo prosecuted his fight, that shee purposed (though shee was inchanted) to make none Patrone of her heart but him, if she wedded not Don Eleno.
Here doth not Lyrgandeo particularize this combat, because he would not be tedious, onely hée affirmeth it was one of the famousest that euer was: and how in the and he was as his companions carried out of the arches, but with a
new wound, for while he made his battell, he chanced to behold Roselia, whom he so well liked, that hee almost forgot the faire Rosiluera Excéeding great ioy conceiued the Gréeke Mars, to haue wonne the Arches, and as he returned throgh them, a Ladie incountred him with these words.
Know, illustrous Emperor, mirrour of the worlds chiualrie, that the end of this aduenture consists in giuing me that ring on your finger, to put it on your wife Claridianas that yonder lieth, and it behooues you to do it with speede, for else her life is short, and readie to exspire her cancelled date, by the hands of that knight which stands ouer her.
Towards the place whence the Damzell came, he turned his head, where he thought he saw his Claridiana lying on the ground, and ouer her a knight with a dagger in his hand, wherewith he offered to stabbe her.
No longer stayed the haughtie Gréeke, but like a furious Lyon, leauing the Ladie he ranne to the knight, who fearing to be slaine, (being Nabato so disguised) togither with the damzell vanished away: whereat the Emperour wondred, as also of the straunge aduenture of the Castle.
In the end of the arches, he found a large wide paire of staires, made all of precious stones, hee ascended them quicker then a hurried bullet from a cannons mouth, and beeing at the toppe, hee sawe a faire rich Gallerie, from whence the Ladies viewed the battels.
At the ende thereof, he past a gorgeous Portall, that opened into a great Hall of admired riches: and as he would enter into it, two Ladies saluted him, whom he thoght to be those before mentioned, being indéed the Princesse Roselia, and Arbolinda.
With much courtesie the Emperour returned their salutations, and to bee assured if they were whom the Tables mentioned, he demanded of them thus.
Let me intreate you faire Ladies, to tell mee where within this dwelling may finde the Princesse Roselia of Rome, and Arbolinda of Scotland, for much desire to sée them, to know whether it bee true, what the world reporteth of their beauties? Then they said.
With one condition (sir knight) we will lead you where they be, which if you denie, it will bee impossible to sée them.
Demaund what you will (replied the kinde warriour) for will performe what euer it be.
We hoped no lesse from your valour (said Arbolinda and therefore we pray you giue vs that ring on your finger, that we may carrie
am content (answered the wary (Gréeke) but first go we beyond yon first Arch, there protest by the faith of a knight, to performe my promise.
That is to denie it (saide Roselia for wee may not go any farther.
Why then soueraigne Ladies (replied Alphebo recall my promise, intended on this condition.
If you be so resolued (said Arbolinda farewell, for we must go vnto the Princesses, vnwoorthie of your discourtesie, that because you wil not performe your promise, shall here remaine inchaunted, vntill the comming of some other more kinder knight, to pittie them.
do so greatly desire to be absolued of my passed word (replied the Gréeke) especially (as you sayd) Roselias libertie depending thereon, that intend perforce, (crauing pardon for my boldnesse) to carrie you where may giue you my ring, and be fréede of my promise.
You will not hope, intreat vs with such violence, for it is not the part of a good knight, to oppresse distressed Ladies, inforcing them against their wils: which to preuent, wee will leaue you, returning to Roselia, that expects vs.
As the gallant Ladies were turning their backes, Trebatios sonne stept to them, and tooke them in his armes, and in his going out of the Gallerie, many hideous fearefull shrikes were heard, and he charged with mightie inuincible blowes, ynough to haue dissolued Vulcans work house: yet for all this, did not the flower of armes cease to go forward, sometimes setting his hands, and sometimes his knées to the ground, and then inclining his head belowe his breast.
Many terrible illusions were opposed against him, sufficient to daunt Mars himselfe.
But they nothing feared him, for the magnanimious Alphebo, by this had descended the staires, and although tormented with oppressiue vlowes, confronted with horred apparisians, and his hearing made deafe wfth miserable howlings, yet hee got out of all the arches, at what instant there sounded the lowdest and most shrillest noyse, with the mightiest thunderclap that euer was heard in the world.
Tenne myles from Rome it was heard, making that famous Cittie shake as with an earthquake, vtterly dissoluing the best inchauntment that euer mortals heard of.
In middest of an oderiferous plaine, did Alphebo find himselfe, clad
in his rich won armor, with his son Claridiano, that equalled him in all things: with them the mightie Claramant, in all respects comparable, to brother and Cousin.
There also was that furious Brauorant, Paragon of the Gyantean regions, accompanied with the new Louer Don Celindo: and with them, the beauteous Princesses, Roselia and Arbolinda.
Well remembred Brauotant what had him befallen, and thinking he had by him béene vanquished, would haue challenged the Emperor of Trebizound about it, but that he descried a great company comming throgh the Forrest: and supposing it to be the Emperour of Rome, hee tooke his leaue of the Princes and Ladies, who were not able to stay him.
And comming to the sea side, he shipped himselfe in his Barke, which in short time brought him to the Souldan of Nyqueas Fléete.
Claridiano and Claramant would also néeds depart, imagining they were not knowne, shaping their course towards Grecia, because they heard the world prepared against her.
Alphebo would not hinder their voyage, séeing it pleased them to conceale their names, and so he tooke his leaue of them.
By this arriued the Emperour of Rome, whom the noyse of their battels, and the beasts howlings had brought thither: and alighting from his Alfana, he embraced his daughter Roselia, and Arbolinda, with such ioy as may be thought.
In the end (to be short) Don Celindo recounted what had befallen, which made them all wonder, admiring Alphebos valours: who also vnwilling to be longer detained, tooke his leaue and departed.
So shipping himselfe, arriued in Constantinople, where he at large discoursed the whole processe of the aduenture.
Don Celindo remained mith Roselia, whose disinchantment was solemnized with many triumphes.
Thus leauing them all, we returne to the valiant Princes, Claramant, and Claridiano, nauigating by sea in their inchaunted Barke.
How the two Princes, Claridiano and Claramant, arriued at Grecia, and of the faire aduenture that befell them with a knight.
WIth more furie then the dreadful threatning Commet renteth his passage through the firie element, did the inchanted barke wherein those two Princes nauigated, furrow the raging billowes of Neptunes inhospitable regions, directing their course towards the memorable Grecian Empire.
So swiftly did it cut the foming waues, that foure daies after, in sight of the Gréekes Fléete, that anchored in the Hauen of Hircambella, and not farre from it they ranne a shore.
It not a little gladded them, knowing where they had arriued, for Claramant greatly desired to sée that Court, so famoused through the world.
Being on land, they mounted vpon mightie horses, which Galtenor had prouided them, with a shield for Trebatios sonne, and so tooke their iourney toward Constantinople, hearing by the way of the proofe of the disamorous Tower: the discourse whereof, Claridiano tolde his vncle, which was the greater motion to stirre him to the triall.
And it comes well to passe, that the earth may know, how both by land and sea, you are Mars his fauorite: but would not for the world, be there knowne, for being banisht by my swéete enemie from her deare presence, should not well obey her commaund, so to disclose my selfe.
Thus treating of this matter, and of Roselias straunge inchauntment, iudging it the haughtiest euer heard of, Claramant began in this manner.
It would reioyce my very soule, to know that famous knight, called of the Sunne, for as suppose, we were all vanquisht by him, and the glorie of that great aduenture solely attributed to him.
Because imagine you will bee glad to knowe who he is, (replied Claridiano knowe, it is the Emperor of Trebezound, whom the heauens decréed to be my father.
am excéeding glad thereof, (said Claramant and sure was, so valiant a sonne could not but procéede from so glorious a father.
to know who those thrée knights were, that kept the arches of the Tower in the sea: for beléeue me, they are the flower of Armes.
Two of them (replied the Prince) can tell you of, the one Bembo by name, King of Achaya, and Lord Generall of the Souldans Fléete: the other is a most strong Pagan, King of Mauritania, and mortall enemie to the Gréekes.
The last, yet séeming of a bigger constitution of composed members, knowe not, sauing that it was he which in our companie proued Rosilias inchantment, being he we met in the Forrest, in battell against the Emperor my father: But the time is long, and we may end any particular combat, for no lesse desire it then you, since crost him on the seas, when defended your ladder.
In this conuersation they came vnto a cleare riuer of fresh bubbling water, which inuited them to find out his spring, to passe away the heate of the afternoone, for the Sunne hauing progrest halfe his course, had alreadie dried the moysture of the earth.
Within a while they found a faire Fountaine, where they allighted, both to wash their faces, and take such repast as Pollisandros prouision affoorded.
Thus they droue away the time with some content, for Claridiano for his vncles sake controwled his greefes, when his Ladies remembrance troubled him.
So béeing desirous to take a nappe, they parted a litle one from the other to sléep.
Short it was, for the Musicke of a swéete voyce awaked them at once.
Haue you euer heard (braue Knight) more swéet harmonie? Beléeue me, we haue met with some good entertainment, for he that sings, in my opinion, should liue by being in loue.
We may not leaue the enioying of so swéete a note.
So they rose togither, and putting on their helmes, tooke their shields and followed the sound they heard, and then ceased.
They came vnto a little groue beset with loftie Pynes, there saw they a shepheard, of the fairest disposition in the world: and so beautifull, that his sight wold haue made him enuious that kept Admetus flockes.
He séemed to be very young, holding a Recorder in his hand, to whose sound tuning his voyce, he sung his soules gréefe vnto those sencelesse trées.
Credit me, Prince of Grecia, (said Claramant that some chance in Loue hath made him so disguise himselfe: for although there be gallant shepheards about these and other fields, yet this his tender behauiors showes, he hath not béene brought vp to tend shéepe.
Let vs attend him (replied Claridiano for hee himselfe will resolue
They néeded not much perswasion to make them listen, for the swéetnesse wherewith he sounded his Instrument, was sufficient to mooue, as did the Thracian Poet his melodie, which when he ended, he warbled foorth this Elegie.
Great must needs be the greef, extreme must needs be the torments Which do feele while want (faire Polinarda) thy sight: Esteeming thy sweet presence my sole happines in life, How may thy long absence but be a death to my heart? On this staie yet liue, in thy disgrace that liue not, For then in endles plagues damned were to perish: Rather as one whose sincere Loue was kindly regarded, On the highest placed was by thy hand: Golden dayes were those.
But now dispoiled of all blisse Like sad Bellerophon, ioyles wander alone.
In darknesse do straie, missing thy Sunne to direct me, My day to night turnde is, my delite into laments.
Vexed thus though am: Complaine on thee yet cannot, Of thee (Ladie diuine) for loue had loue againe.
Spightfull Fortune it is, that of all ioyes hath me bereaued, And with deadly malice crost me with heauy mishaps.
Distrest by Fortune, yet neuer will be daunted, Maugre her, and her force, will loue, and be belou'd: Enuious ill Fortune cannot compell me to dispaire, When she hath her worst done, then can be but a wretch.
Then when most am a wretch, most co~stant shalbe my hope then, Which without her compasse firmly by faith do keepe: Her force will not feare, nor seeke for her helpe that lou'd be Oh fayrest of fayres, on thee alone depend: In presence was lou'd, and shalbe doubt not in absence (Lady, in whom vertue like to thy bewtie shineth, Constant as comely).
Bur alas, that must like a Pilgrime Wander a whole age thus through regions so remote, Kingdomes farre distant, where wish in vaine to behold thee, Where new sprung dangers hourely delaie my returne From thy sight banished, whose siluer rayes be so splendent That therewith dazled, Cynthia hideth her head!
Expect yet do still and that day daily do looke for,
In thy sweete presence once yet againe to reioyce: Conuerting sadnesse to gladnesse, sorrow to singing: Rapte in blisse, then shall perpetually tryumph.
In meane time resting on this so sacred a comfort, This thy want perforce with patience do beare, Till the raging tempest of Fortunes fury be And of all turmoyles shall haue a happie release.
No more could the two valiant Gréekes vnderstand, for the vehement grones that burst from his soule, togither with sighes, drowned the verie sound of his words.
Now that he had thus giuen a litle passage to his griefes, by publishing them vnto those loftie pynes, that by bowing their spreading braunches, séemed to pittie his distresse, with a breathlesse (Ay me) he began his laments in this maner.
Oh Loue! how extreamly hast thou executed the power of thy rygor on me? Oh my tender yeres, eclipsed in the budding of your spring, with the nipping winter of sower griefe: Iniustly hast thou made me an example of the happiest Louer that euer was, neuer hauing against thy soueraintie so much as in thought offended, nor yet in any thing gainsaid or contradicted thy awfull power.
Oh acknowledge it, and do confesse what happinesse is obtained, submitting true dutie to thy commaund, as to the sole deitie able to giue life, or swéetest death: and yet for all thou art long since assured with what submissiue humblenesse haue obeyed thy behests, and with patience endured thy crosses, so dearely bought, at the highest rate and price of my content, it pleaseth thée, when the soueraigne Goddesse of my soule, would most fauour me, to exile me her presence by such cruell meanes.
On me, and my poore heart, that neuer did offend thée, hauest thou tyrannized with all inhumanitie, winking and pardoning the Conspirators against thy rule.
What hast thou got by absenting me from her stampt in my liuing soule? wherein wert thou offended, when beheld her presence? were it not feare to be accounted Traytor vnto thy Crowne and Principallitie, would call, and proclaime thée (ouer and besides that thou art cruell) to be enuious: and if not so, that Iealousie (plague of mortals, and immortals) to sée me loue and liue thereby, and in recompence of so firme a faith, to hope for the glorie of being againe beloued,
hath forced thée to make me in exile wander thus from that her happie presence.
neuer haue séene tokens of a perfecter Louer in my life (said Claridiano and as am a Knight, if it lie in mee to helpe him, will doo it to the daunger of my life.
Of this and more is the Louer worthie of (answered his vncle): but would not haue had you bound your selfe vnto so much, wherby you should omit your iourney to Constantinople, the which would gréeue my very soule, especially loosing your company.
To doo so would increase my sorrow in the highest degrée (said the Prince) because our loue bindes vs to gréeue at others absence: yet will not remit to procure his co~tent, that know how to loue so intierly: and it may be, shall this way find some measure for my torments: knowing that her sight (Commandresse of my soule) will but augment my paines, by being in disgrace: and what great glorie it were to bee imbraced in her grace.
But go we to him that learned to loue, and not feare the plague of absence, for neuer yet did any féele it, but iudged it woorse then death.
Let vs go (replied the frée youth) for it is charitie to helpe him in al thinges.
Wherevpon they made a little noyse, that the carelesse shepheard might heare their going.
With some alteration he did rise, supposing some other matter.
But when (by Mooneshine) hee fawe those two knight, the riches of their armour, and so gallant disposition, hée went to méete them (beeing no lesse courteous then any) and saide.
What is it you this way séeke (braue knights?) for although Fortune hath brought me to the last poynt, to make me dispaire of my selfe, so may in any thing worke your contents, beléeue mee, will be glad shee should, for that time lengthen my despised life, then which could not be more plagued.
Wee come this knight and my selfe, to offer our persons to procure your content (courteous sheppheard) if your necessities requires them, the which we shal hazard, with more will then you to imploy them.
There is no satisfaction, nor yet gratefulnesse, sufficient to ballance your most kinde offer (gallant Knights, replied the shepheard) but in doing it, you haue made known the valor and magnanimitie of your heroicke minds, whereto by bountie you were bound.
Oh, may Loue recompence it (if it hath not bene possible to denie his soueraigntie) with more ioyes then at his hands haue receiued: but now any comfort whatsoeuer, will but augment my gréefe, the which hath so far extended it selfe, that no remedy nor salue can cure it.
But althogh phisicke doth not alwaies whole cure the inueterated Mallady, yet many oftentimes it preuents, and expelles many dangerous accidents, that would else excéedingly aggrauate the infirmitie, and so for all it may not now please you to communicate it to those that will féele your sorrow, it will be some consolation to sée the~ pittie it, were it but to be answered with (take comfort, for others haue bene vsed with like crueltie, and you are not alone despised in the world).
It is euen so, said the amorous shéepheard: for amongst all the greatest consolations inuented to mittigate the paines in loue, to communicate them, is the cheefest: yet in me to discouer them, it is an offence against the partie loue.
But to tell the torments haue endured, and what happinesse they had obtained, and my extreame fall from that high felicitie, were to wrong my selfe in the recitall, for it will be but an argument of little sufferance in me, séeing that the least of my suffered paines was sufficient to withstand a thousand deathes: But now to consider they haue let me suruiue, oh, there is no euill comparable to it, nor none can deuise worse.
For had then bene depriued of my abhorred life, shuld not haue bene so familiar with sower gréefe: yet to sée that after the loosing of that soueraigne good, my life doth still persecute me with woes, that death fearing to come neare them, flyes from me when most do call him: oh there is no patient that can endure this, nor haue power to tollerate it, but with millions of continuall teares, to bewaile this losse and my misfortunes.
Farther hée could not proceede, for his teares interrupted him, which so mooued the tender hearted Prince, that they intreated him to make them pertakers of his gréefs, that they might iudge whether he haue reason so to gréefe.
am sure it is good to relate the tenor and processe of my woes, vnto such Knights: yet my distressed soule refuseth to refresh the memorie with so many euilles: but that you may know how small this my languishment is, sit you down, and you shall heare the greatest iniustice that euer was vsed towards any:
he being assured of my faith, that doth reward it not as it deserues, but according to his pleasure, as a Tyrant.
They all sate them downe vnder the couert of a spreading Oake, where the Gréekes put off their Helmes, whose bewties admyred the shéepheard, who with some sighes moouing them to silence, he began.
Since you be pleased (Sir knights) to haue me recount the Pilgrimage of my oppressed life, and who am: so that séeming to receiue content thereby, shall not néed to intreate you to yéeld me that attencion, my manifold sorrowes do deserue.
Know therefore (most Noble warriors) how that imperiall power that doth command both Gods and men, pardoning none of no kinde, meane Loue, soueraigne of all soueraignes, hath inforced me into this disguised habit: And yet when ponder how extreamely the blinde Goddesse is bent against me, finde my selfe not secure therein: for haue ere this bene honored, and as a Prince acknowledged, vntill my loues, exilde me through the world.
This Deitie (gallant Knights) when in greatest pompe and iollitie liued in Apulia, (whereof the Heauens allotted me Prince) sent and conducted thither those, whose tongues were tuned with the dulced notes of the gallantnesse and bewtie of the Princesse of Lucania.
With such déepe roote did her faire name insert it self within my frée thoghts, that it is now impossible to leaue to loue her, in that both she and haue by a hidden grace, accorded in one thing.
But doubt it is the nature of our climate, or they that breathe therein, by custome to bee subiect to like misfortunes.
What shall remember Hanniball, who had hee not knowne Apulia, then had hee not beene insnared in this passion, but béene Lord of Rome, and not through loue, ouerthrow his eternall honour, wonne with such losse of his owne blood.
Yet was not this example of any force to diuert me from my new imaginations, but rather in greatest haste prepared my iourney towards Lucania, whither went, onely with a Page, my horse and Armour, soly to sée Pollinarda, and if her perfections equalled the fame of her bewtie.
arriued in time when it most florished, because the Court was then full of knights that serued her.
And in faith beleeue me, that how far soeuer the report of her prayses excéeded beléefe, so farre and more did finde them to limp behinde her excellencies noted.
In my opinion the heauens haue not created a more absoluter bewtie, because Enuie it selfe hath found no meanes to seize thereon, and therefore is become the Herauld of her worthes.
You may think (Noble Sir) these were new snares to intrap my captiue soule.
Asumptuous tryumphe was ordained in the Citie, which in auncient times was called Frossa, which in the Assyrian tongue, signifieth happy.
It was so indéed, and euen from the beginning, for she neuer had a Quéene, but was also in bewtie so.
This occasion did Fortune offer me (oh she did further me to make my mishaps the greater) placing me neare vnto a brother of hers: by name Lysander, a knight both young and valiant, and in loue too with the Infant of Campania, that in court accompanied the princesse Pollinarda: high Solesia, no lesse bewtifull then kinde, who knowing how she was beloued, wold not ill repay Lysanders faith, and so the gallant liued in some respects assured of his hopes.
Oh, yet neuer had any full assurance, if he still will be amorous.
On the aduerse part, was Leader, the valiant Prince of Calabria, Agesilao by name, the happiest that knew, in that without the panges of passions, and soules afflictions, he obtained to be beloued of Pollinarda, and in such open manner, that the whole popularitie did know it.
It did not gréeue my Ladies father, but rather it so pleased him, that in open shew he exprest it, which more animated the Lady to grace him with new fauours, which were sharpe poynted daggers, stucke in the heart of wofull Florisiano, for so am named.
Oh it could not be lesse, beholding with my owne eyes my own sorrow.
At length the Iousts began, wherein my starres vouchsafed a little to aduance me, which did attract Lysanders affection, with such true zeale, that there cannot bee firmer friendship then that hee hath shewen me: yea, although against his sister.
The whole multitude turned their gazing eyes on my deuice, which was, blew armes, crost with yeallow barres.
On my shéeld was portrayed suspition in her naturall colour, as in auncient times she was paynted, bearing a scrowle, with this word.
Wisely, who can her despise, That onely doth employ her eyes To spie out Loues subtilties.
There was no Ladie in the place, but noted my iealous colours, and so (as after vnderstood) some that were more pittifull, prayed for my victorie: which maketh me think their orizons and good will abode me the honour of the iousts.
So Lysander (that greatly affected me) and I, cleared the place, that none wold more aduenture: and hauing don, yet did not disclose my selfe, neither to him nor any other, although the King himselfe was very importunate to know me: onely this they got, that was called the iealous Knight.
Sure am, that my Ladie béeing so busied wtth Agesilao, shee did not note my déeds, but rather (for it was told me) she was displeased, that vnknown, had vnhorsed her Louer in the Liftes.
Néedes would the Prince Lysander haue mee to his owne lodging, professing himself so intier a friend, that he hath wonne me to the death: the which will gladly receiue, to procure his content.
In greater bonds did he tie me, altogither expressing his much noblenesse, by discouering vnto me, the sinceritie of his loue towards Solefia, Infant of Campania.
could not but highly estéeme of the trust he reposed in me, being but a Knight, possessing nought but armour and horse.
He intreated me to accompanie him that night in a Maske, because the king his father in honour of the iousts, feasted all the Princes with shews and reuellings.
It pleased me in my soule, in that shuld behold her presence that gouerned my heart.
In two long robes of cloth of golde we issued, masked: yet would not go so vnprouided, but that had on a priuie coate, which in my wandring daies vsed, bearing armes.
In this manner we entered the Pallace, when the reuels began.
Euery Ladie that had her gallant there, fauoured him, to daunce with him.
Of these was my deare friend Lysander one, whose Mistresse was attired in the same colour that we were.
They daunced with such grace, that Cupid himselfe could not but like it.
Next to him, did Agesilao take Pollinarda Princesse of beautie, by the hand.
cannot de+nie what the heauens had imparted them, for their grace and Maie+stie,
Many excellent changes and tricks they vsed, yet the iealous passion of my gréeued soule stirred vp more in my face, by comming and going of my running colour.
Had not my friende bene there, rather then would haue suffered it, my heart vpon a two edged sword should haue bene split, or reuenged.
The beloued youth was famoused to be an excellent Musitian, as indéed he was.
So his Lady (or rather espouse, for her father had agreed thereto) gaue him a Lute to play thereon.
Hee accepted it, (for he was fully bent to performe her will) and began to touch it with more swéeter musicke then hee that descended to the infernall Vaultes to fetch his wife.
Then with a cleare voice he warbled forth this Dittie, the which my memorie carried away, the more to increase my paine.
That brow, which doth with faire all faires excell, Those eyes that shining lends the world his light, That gracious mouth where all the Graces dwell, That dimpled chin, the whetstone of delight, Those two rare Mounts, of Lillies and of Roses, That in their swelling, all content encloses.
That brow, eye, mouth, chin, and most daintie cheeke, Doth call, keepe, hold, bind, and in giues restraine My heart, eye, eare, my thought, and iudgement, eeke, That no wise force, can free me thence againe.
Yet do loue my pleasing paine so well, That boue all ioyes, prize my heauenly hell.
Let dunghill basenesse and the earthy mind, His summum bonum place in what he list: My soule (which strange diuinitie doth find) Within thy faces centure to consist: Will not consent that any other bee My onely good, but onely, onely thee.
Thy brow, shall be the dreadfull snowy Barre, Where will daylie for thy mercie plead:
Thy chin and cheeke, shall equall power beare: The first to cheere, the last to keepe in feare.
And thou thy selfe, (Goddesse of my desire) In my Hearts temple, dayly Ile adore, No other Deitie will admire, No other power diuine, will implore: Great Goddesse keepe me, in thy fauour shine, My heart, eye, eare, my thought and iudgements thine.
Thus did he runne vpon the treble with such heauenly melodie, that had he not bene Agesilao that sung, beléeue me braue knight, would haue liked it: but being done by the enemie to my rest, it was worse then hell vnto mine eyes, that saw it.
And in faith, his song was but the méere truth, although she was too cruell towards him, yet was the cause, as shal tell you.
No imperfection was noted in the continuance of his Harmonie: So hauing done, he laide by his Lute, the which the Princesse bequeathed to Solesia, who in compassion of my (as shee thought) ill placed affection, warbled out this cold comfort.
Feare not Tyme may prooue soueraigne plaister for your Loue.
Such a faith so firmely grounded, Such a Loue so kindly placed: From a Heart so deepely wounded, From a person so well graced: Needs must get the Hearts desiring, Though hope, yet seeme not to say it.
And though this Tyme seeme retyring, Tyme heereafter may repay it.
Feare not Tyme may prooue soueraigne plaister for your Loue.
did not conceiue the meaning of her conceit, vntill vnderstood shee did suspect affected her Couzen, and so to put mee in hope
(being glad accompanied her Louer) shee animated me, with that did requite it, when it pleased Loue to do by me, as by then assuring her how intierly she was beloued of my friend, whereof had experience, in the many daies continued in Lucania.
thinke Lysander did perceiue the affection bore his sister, yet hee shewed him so like a Knight, that he not only dissembled it, but séemed to reioyce, wish my hopes might take place, if that the Callabrian had not bin the~ betwéen.
But being no longer able to indure the pestiferous plague of iealousie, on the foure Gates of the Cittie, secretly caused so many shieldes to be set vp, wheron, vnder an vnknowne name, named my self maintainer of the ring, an exercise and pastime much vsed in that land, by reason it is near vnto the Spanish soyle, whose nation, challengeth the sole preheminence ouer this exercise, as skilfullest and principall Authors thereof.
No knight in the Cittie would admit it, séeing the Callabrian did refuse it, vnlesse did expresse my name, the which, in that could not do without danger of my life, graunted notwithstanding, that any should openly defend Pollinardas beautie, which by another name couertly maintained.
Therevpon Agesilao presently subscribed, and and after him many prepared to winne at the ring.
The day béeing come, you may thinke (braue knights) he would shew himselfe in the richest manner he could, as a Prince so famous and happie.
So did the Ladie attired all in white, adding such vertue to her excellencies, that had not béen inurde to suffer discontented paines, my perplexed heart would haue burst.
The sport beganne, wherein hee behaued himselfe according to his Ladies fauors, with which it had not béene much, hee had performed much more.
There were wee, my friend Lysander and my selfe meane, in seuerall colours, for his attire was gréene, imbrodered with Artechokes of golde, manifesting a maiesticke minde.
But still with iealousie tormented, durst not but differ from him, apparrelled in yellow, laced with blew and golde, and mounted on a mightie Courser, which from Apulia had brought.
My hearts heart, likes my heart, and againe, Like my hearts heart, so both content remaine.
His Lady well vnderstood it, for she tendered him as her soule.
Dispaire, yeeld, sith all things do agree, Into thy clawes, to driue dispairing me.
Valiant was the gallant Lysander, to whom granted the first course, whose prize he wonne, which was a Pelican, by nature cruell to himself, onely to become kinde to his kinde.
It, did Solesia receiue with greater ioy, then possessed, séeing my Ladies bewtie so ill defended: yet was reuiued in my drouping thoghts, hearing how all the multitude adiudged Pollinarda stil to be fairest.
After him took my turne, wherin the heauens so aided me, that at euery carreire, tooke the ring on my lances point.
Then in signe of victorie, had a Crowne of golde deliuered me.
They could not haue giuen me a thing ye more might please me at that occasion, for had an other ready made of purpose to present her, if issued victor.
Making my horse set his knées on the ground, presented them both, but about my prepared Coronet, had caused to be engrauen this posie.
Well deserues her head a Crowne, Who Crownes with praise all womankind: Therefore, Loue hath sent me downe, As token of his louing mind, Crowne, to Crowne the Crowne of Nature, Soueraigne of all earthly feature.
He presently suspected was hee that had vanquished the Iousts in the same colour, since whe~ he noted it by many occasions, as also how affected his lady.
So trusting to many friends and kinsfolkes he had in the place, yet chéefely thinking was vnarmed, and being spurred with a iealous frenzie, he stepped to me, so did my friend, suspecting there would be some hurliburly: He thus said.
know not knight, whereon thou hast grounded thy presumption, so to deliuer the pryzes in such preiudiciall maner.
To sée how ill the excellent bewtie of this soueraigne princesse is defended: for if acccordingly some were so rewarded with fauour, you might with as great right go without it, as an other that know.
He was bolde of his vallor, and being toucht to the quick, he drew his sword against me.
He had got nothing by the aduenture, for sauing my head, was else all armed, and with mine in my hande, at two steppes was within him, so neare, that he had not satisfied his boldnesse with lesse then his life: but we were separated by the standers by, that it procéeded no farther then in words.
Euery one blamed him, which incouraged me (without respect of displeasing my Lady) to challenge, cast him my honors gage, as a warning he should be alwaies prouided, against wheresoeuer we met.
We departed thence, and so angred, that thought it long til incountred him.
Now the Reuels of that night being ended, the two were contracted with the Fathers publike consent: and the houre of rest approached, euery one withdrew into his lodging, so that Agesilao possest with excesse of ioy, and forgetting my challenge, he closely with two men got him vnder his Ladies window, where, knowing what pleasure she receiued with his Musicke, he played this Dittie vppon his Lute.
What ere he is that would behold, Imperious Cupids sporting place: Here to gaze, let him be bold, On this bewteous comely grace.
Here doth rarest bewtie dwell, On her brow doth Cupid sit: This is she that doth excell, Both for her bewtie, loue and wit.
In her Cupid taketh rest, Ioy and blisse with her haue end: Who knoweth her, is double blest, Whose bewtie day, to night doth le~d.
My rage swelling heart, could not suffer him to procéed farther, for with more fury then my feare would allow, rusht vpon him, saying: The time and place doeth now fit (discourteous Prince) that the death of one of vs shall testifie the vallor of the other.
himselfe accompanied with two, made them the bolder all thrée to assaile me: refused them not, but valiantly put my selfe among them: mortally wounded one, which gaue me way the sooner to méet with the vnhappie Prince, who so litle liued to enioy his louing hopes: for driuing him before me til he was vnder his Mistresse window, with a strong thrust ranne him through: where the blinde Goddesse of Chaunce, séemed yet to fauour him, as to be stucke to his Ladies wall.
At the last grone wherewith he yéelded his soule, heard another, the fearfullest, that euer before or since heard, because it procéeded from Pollinarda.
It so daunted me, that had like to haue bene taken, all the knights guard, with others, being thither come.
As secretly as might shrunke away, til had time to set my safetie on my féete, getting to my Lodging, saying nothing of what had happened vnto my friend, yet had he questioned me about it, he could not but haue perceiued it.
How the Prince of Apulia, with much pitie continued the discourse of his life vnto the Greeke Princes.
TO proue how many daungers, and perillous inconueniences the disordinate passion of inconsiderate Loue doth cause, there shall néede no arguments nor preambles of large discourses to auerre it: for the experience that euery one sustaines by paines and griefes thereof, togither with the opinion of that famous Philosopher that said: If this disordered Motiue of intemperate and furious motions, had not bene indengered in the breasts of mortalls, as some plague and scourge for euils, infinit and Capitall deadly crimes had neuer bene committed, nor imagined.
Well is this saying confirmed by the vnhappy death of the Calabrian prince, at the hands of the Apulian Florisiano: who with equal grace and griefe, prosecuted the tenor of his woes thus.
The bitter exclamatios that sounded in the Pallace (braue knights) and the hurliburly of the Citie, séemed no lesse, then had it bene round
Dead as he was, he was carried to the Lady, so she gaue in charge, for louing him so dearly in his life, she would not in his death forsake him.
She did lamentably bewaile ouer the murthered Corpes, when disguised came thither, for could not but go and sée her, of whose sorrow had bene the causer.
Oh cruell heauens (said the wofull Ladie) with what barbarous immanitie haue you extended your rygorous power on me, more then on any Ladie else? Oh Sauadge and inhumane wretch, murtherer of my soule, may it be there shall want Iustice, where such bloodie déedes haue abounded? Ay me vnfortunate Prince, how cruelly in thy tender yeares art thou by an vntimely death persecuted.
thousand times did she sound vpon the deceased Truncke, holding it in her lappe.
So extreame were my passions (Syr knights) that to sée him in that manner, almost became iealous, iudging had fauoured him, by so sheading of his blood, that in death (were it not sencelesse) to enioy so swéete a fauour.
Considering my great intyer loue, my state for his would haue chaunged.
By little and little approached so neare her, that lifting vp her eyes, she met with him that was cause of all her sorrowe: shée supposing it, cried out aloude and saide: Why doo you suffer the bloodie murtherer with such presumption to appeare thus before the murthered? Oh Gods, sufficient strength, did then desire, sufficiently to be reuenged.
Some of the dead Princies Allyes, did suddainly arise, which forced me without farther regard, to shewe my selfe guiltie of the fact by drawing my weapons.
The Pillers of the yarde (whither was got following Pollinarda defended my backe, whereby hauing slaine thrée or foure, the rest with feare retired, giuing me leaue to returne vnto the place where the Ladie continued her laments.
There said would yeelde both my selfe and my weapons into the Princesse hand.
So ioyfully resolued to accompany the dead prince, to please the Ladie, and therevpon taking my sword by the point, prostrated on my knées, said: Most excellent Ladie, if any offence hath bene committed, it hath beene with this, wherewith you may take what reuenge you will on mée, that was the executioner thereof.
Beléeue me (heroicke knights) there is no crueltie like to that, kindled within the breast of an angry woman, peremptorily resolued, for so she may haue her will, no life she doth respect.
She tooke the sword, and with inraged courage, she offered to execute what had accounted my happinesse, so she were contented: but her strength fayled her in the execution of the blow, falling after the blade in a traunce, whose point scratching my Front, did let foorth my blood.
And though greater wounds then that had not felt, yet that noted, when the Lady returning to her selfe, spied my deare blood on her face, as the spoyles of her intent.
sufficient marke was that (braue knights) to asswage the greatest paine.
Millions of thankes gaue Fortune for it, attributing that hap to her: for being so rare, it could not but procéed from such a blinde distributresse of vnexpected benefits.
had no power to defend me from those that assailed me, being weaponlesse, who had giue~ me a thousand deaths, much more one, but that my friend and faithfull Lysander, arriued at the instant, who drawing his sword, approued his friendship to be great, by shielding me from a shamefull death, though not from a rygorous prison, where the King commaunded me that night to be cast in, shewing himselfe to be most excéedingly angry and gréeued.
You may easily suppose (woorthie Syrs) what might féele, being in that sort imprisoned, especially, when the next day was adiudged in the open place to bee beheaded.
did not so much sorrowe to be ledde to die, as to depart in my Ladies disgrace.
Who moste like an eager Tyger of Hyrcania, stil cryed and yelled out for reuenge.
But it pleased my inconstant chance, (from whence gather, was reserued to suffer greater paines) that should knowe my Iaylor, being a knight both gentle and kinde, whom by deserts had bound to pleasure me: for in former times, had no lesse saued him then his life, defending it from them that would haue spilt it.
Hee much encouraged me: saying, he would for my sake vndertake any perill, béeing thereto long since indebted.
His kindnesse did much comfort me, although neuer imagined to steale from prison, for all he would haue set mee at libertie, for was resolued to die louing her, by that meanes working my Ladies content,
that she might sée suffered the deserued punishment, on me inflicted for so displeasing her.
onely intreated him, by the amitie and loue had once shewen him, séeing my death was not to be auoyded, and that might leaue the world contently, he should procure the deliuerie of a letter from me to my Ladie, for it would be my latest happinesse.
He had before that (noble knights) heard mee complaine, and vtter my true harts sorrow, togither with the cause thereof: which made him bid me write, for he would with his owne hand conuey it to hers, and also get me an aunswere.
Had much more done for you then haue (sir knight) this your kind offer is a sufficient satisfaction for the same, binding me anew (ouer and aboue your loue) to procure your content in any thing may: to effect which desire, oh would had a long life, that a déed so rare and in such distresse offered and performed, might with sufficient recompence bee guerdoned.
Thus animated writ my letter, whose coppie haue about mee, the which, though it may séeme troublesome to you, wil read, togither with the answere: and then you will say, haue reason to complaine.
He drew his letter, and opening it with a sigh, hee reade it thus.
NOt without fear (most soueraigne Princesse of Lucania euen at the last moment of my life, do presume to write, not intreating that may liue, for that, nor the intiernesse of my Loue to your seruice, will permit it, nor yet can perswade my selfe it would sort to any good effect, because am the petitioner: for although it sometimes passed throgh my pensiue thoughts to demaund it, to imploy the same to your content, It presently vanisheth like ayre, with remembrance of the vnhappie successe of your distressed Louers vntimely fall.
And although my fault may haue some hope of pardon, beeing committed through the aboundance of pure Loue, yet is it crost, because it was against thee, when onely should haue dissembled my paine, and not (procuring to asswage it) increase thine in the highest degree.
But am resolued to die, seeing you and my misfortunes, will haue, and haue ordained it
do not offend, beseeching thee, that with thy leaue, may intreat to be carried to the place of execution along by thy windowe, for the sight of thy presence, wil much abate my greefe and tertor of so sharpe a death.
It shall be a fauour that with content wil license my departure, when this haplesse bodie trodde downe with woes, shal be dispossest of life.
The immortall Gods preserue thine as they can, and he wishes that expects the approaching of the expiring minute of his.
Hauing done, to the Court did the Iaylor (sir knights) high him.
He was a man in whom the King and al the Nobilitie reposed much trust: so might he enter vncontrowlde into fair Pollinardas chamber, whom (as he tolde me) he found clad all in mourning, still continuing her laments.
By little and litle in their discourses, hee forced her by occasion to demand for me: whereto he replied.
was one that momentarily expected his death, from whom tooke this letter, finding it on his Deske, and séeing it was directed to your Highnesse, heere bring it to be burnt, least it import some further euil.
He did so cunningly deliuer it, and skilfully perswade the reading, that she thought him ignorant of the tenor.
Shee tooke and perused it, from whence redounded the procéeding of the greatest crueltie euer heard of.
From Medea and Progne hath Pollinarda taken their names of cruell: for her aunswere, denotes her much more inhumane, the which do intreate you to attend, that you may be assured what power a womans rage is of, to execute her will.
COnfounded was twixt two extreames by thy Letter, (most bloodie knight, and the cruellest that was euer borne:) the one increased my paine, thinking on thy presumption, and my ignorance in receiuing thy lewd scribled paper, because it came from him that bereaft mee of my life, murthering that vnhappie Prince.
The other which account woorse then hell, to be constrained to answere thee: because to dissemble with thy letter, were to giue
ayme to thy boldnesse, with occasion that thou mightest think it pleased me, (by my silence) to graunt thy request, admitting thy least euill, the which my selfe denying it, and adding tenne times more tortures to thy deserued punishment, it would be termed no new crueltie, proceeding from mee so exceedingly wronged and offended.
My sight thou hast no need to desire, if it shall any thing auayle for thy content: for hee that spoyled mee of my ioy, hath no reason to demaund any.
And since thou murderedst his life that did not merit it, thou hast merited the cruellest death that may be deuised, the which will hasten to execution.
cannot wish thee life, to ende mine: because doo procure thy death to comforte mee.
He hath reason (noble Knights saide the Prince, hauing ended) to pine, to languish, to trauell without ioy and content, that liued to sée so kinde a letter as mine, aunswered with such disdaine and rigor.
Who hath euer heard of such crueltie as this? had no tongue to complaine of her, nor power to banne my luckelesse starres.
For considering how did offend her, thought this course of wrath too little: But desired (so dearely did loue Pollinarda it should bee saide of her, shee had with greatest bountie and noblenesse, forgiuen the greatest enemie of her content, and sole spoyler of her ioy, for that had béene a manifest token of ouer her owne anger, and reuenging thirst, which is the sole glorie aboue all others, to eternize an honourable minde, because it is generally accorded, that to bee a greater triumph obtained ouer our proper selues, then to vanquish either heauen or earth.
Onely for this is that Ladie much bound to me, that neuer desired nor imagined any thing, but to the aduancement of her honor and fame.
My gentle Kéeper greatly comforted me, knowing how intierly loued.
He performed an act, the which hauing since (without affection) often déeply wondred with my selfe, yet could neuer resolue mee of the cause, more then the motion of a vertuous inclination, to comiserate a haplesse chance.
should the next day be openly beheaded, (against which execution, my deare friend Lycanders intercessions nothing preuailed) that entring my chamber with a courage resolue, he thus spake vnto me.
You sée (sir knight) what the king hath determined on your affaires, it doth so gréeue my very soule, that to saue your life, would gladly loose mine, and hazard my credit with his Maiestie, wronging his reposed confidence in me, and will giue you libertie through this Tower, for it is impossible you should scape by this Gate, by reason of the strong guard that kéepes you.
And gréeue not thus to discontent your Ladie, for the processe of time will lessen her concealed sorrowe for Agesilaos death, better then yours may now satisfie her reuenge.
Let it be so, and by this meanes reserue your life, bee it but to imploy it in louing her: for it is not the part of a noble breast to dispaire of euery thing, but it rather belongs to a couragious minde, to nourish his decaying hopes with bolde confidence.
He so well perswaded me (most famous knights) that resolued to preserue my life by that sower remedie.
And first to comfort him, for the depriuation of his estate, which he willingly did forgo to escape away with me, tolde him for whom vndertooke that daunger, discouering my selfe vnto him.
It gladded him, and therevppon hee tooke off my boltes and Gyues, wherein my aduerse fortune had bound me, and so the night being come, we descended the Tower by a corded ladder, through a window that ouerlooked the sea coast, where he had prouided a well rigged Barke: entring therein a maine, wee lancht from the Cittie of Frossa, not without many sighes teares from my heart, thinking how much did displease the Ladie of my life thereby, in that her pleasure consisted on my death.
Thrée daies did wee nauigate with a faire gayle, which made mee thinke, better fared on the seas, then on the land.
The second time would not Fortune let me repeate it, for conspiring with Eolus, they both would néeds trie their fiercenesse on my patience, with the cruellest storme that hath béen séen: for the waues beginning to swell, threatning the heauens and strongest rockes, what might not we feare, that were tossed on their billowes, sometimes hoysed to the cloudes, and then cast lower then the center of the earth? So that he which suffered lesse paine, was glad to submit to deaths stroke.
Such and so many flashes of water came tumbling into our vessell, that
full against our willes, wee were forced to taste the sauor of Neptunes saultest licquor.
On the sudden we were surprized with such a whirlewinde, that we lost all hope of recouery, for the persecuted Barke laie wallowed vp and downe, aboue halfe an houre, vntil a contrary winde ouermaistring the tempest, cast it neare the shore, and running on a shole, it splitted in the midst.
Our clamors and shrikes then, are not to be beléeued, nor wil rehearse them, for my tongue is insufficient.
He that by chaunce got then any aduantage, was by fastning on some péece of boord, a litle to prolong his life.
It was so hideous darke, that none could sée the other, nor light any fire could we, for the winde dispearcing it, would blow it out.
Thus grapled on a planke, left my friend, and wrastling with the seas, fortune, and death: the Gods permitted me (yet know not why) to saue my abhorred life.
And about the dawning of the day, found my selfe on the sandie Hauen of Argier, so brused and tired, that could not stand on my féete, for besides my toyles, had not slept in foure daies before, still by moments expecting my neare approching death.
was willing to take a nappe, before would go into the countrie, so stepping among some growing wéedes, slept a good while, receiuing a little rest and ease.
Quickly was it bereaft mee, falling in the hands of those barbarous Infidels of that Sconse, that neither pitlie nor pardon any, though they bee of their owne sect, so much they trust to the strength of that their Castle.
They carried me vnto a rich Turke, Lieftenant of the Fortresse, who bought me for two hundreth Chequins, to serue him with his other slaues.
imployed the vtmost of my power therein, which redownded to such effect, that hee trusted me aboue all his other seruitors.
My painfull, diligent, and carefull seruice, came to the kings hearing, that he would néeds haue me from his Lieftenant, paying the double that my first Maister had done for me.
will omit (valiant Princes) how might gréeue to be so hurried from Market to Market to be solde.
It pleased my fortune to let me so farre obtaine the Kings grace, as that hee let mee go at libertie without bands, but marked in the front as his slaue.
learned to speak the language, which much auayled me, would haue violated my faith consecrated to my Ladie, for Troyla his daughter did euen dote
on me: but to him that had vowed his soule to Pollinardas excelle~cies, and wanting the consolation of her presence, that increased his torment.
purpose to shunne her importunities, once of so many times, they had iniustly bought and solde me to runne away.
One night among the rest, resolued to do it, the which might easily accomplish, considering the much libertie had: yet would not do it without a farewell of the beauteous Troyla, because would not séeme vngratefull for her loue and fauors.
You may imagine how she might take it, affecting me (in my opinion) as her selfe: neuerthelesse, her true loue teares could not stay poore distressed Iaroe, so was called by the Turkes.
Shee seeing me thus obstinately determined, requested to know who was, then which shee required no other comfort: did not hazard much thereby, and therefore satisfied her.
It somewhat quieted her, protesting to come to my kingdome, or neuer to receiue husband, but at my hands.
Therevpon tooke my leaue, a thousand times embraced by her, for durst not do it, fearing thereby to wrong her, that is the of my ioyes.
Shée gaue me more necessaries for my iourney then néeded, and therewith departed from Argier, where nothing got, but like a slaue to be marked in the forehead.
could not rest, so tormented was with variable cogitations, yet in the end resolued to returne into Lucania, sure to be knowne of none, for that my cares, and the troubles of the seas, had impaired and altered my countenance, as also my slaues marke.
And considering how long since was yoaked and captiuated with Loues slauerie, nothing gréeued at the signes thereof: for accounting them giuen me as by Pollinardas hands, did therein repute my selfe most happie.
In these tempestuous toyles, and turbulent shipwracks, spent one yeare and an halfe, which was too much to be forgot, though not in my Ladies Pallace.
thought that Fortune (by ayding me with prosperous gales) would now at length séeme to pittie me, for in fewe daies arriued in Lucania, where inquired how matters passed.
was informed, that one of the strongest knights now knowne (the Gréeke Princes that admit no comparatiue, excepted) was thither
The deceased Princes younger brother he was: but farre valianter: for there is no Gyant able to withstand him.
Hee solicited and wooed by all means to obtain the Ladies good will, knowing there past no more betwéene her and his brother, then an exterior affection confirmed with espowsed faith.
Yet doth he insist therein, haughtie and proude is Asternio the fierce, so is he named.
Many times was about to buy horse and armor, to trie my fortune, which is vnable to suffer any Competitor in my loue and hopes.
But let it alone, to sée to what end my slauish turkish habit would sort vnto.
Sometimes beheld her, which was no small redresse to my afflicted minde, yet was it tempered, séeing her disconted, which pure loue made me thinke was for Agesilao.
So one day walking neare her chamber window, met with my friend the Prince Lysander.
Euen from his secret cabinet, did my heart leape with his suddaine sight.
He stayed to looke on mee, and séeing me attired like a Turke, with a turbant on my head, and the rest of my apparrell neate and cleane, he demaunded whence was.
aunswered of Carthage, and that by great good happe had freed my selfe from Argiers bondage.
He intreated me (I know not if through affection) to become his seruant.
agréede thereto, onely againe to trie my fortune that way.
Thence wée went to the Pallace, where hée acquainted his new seruitor with his Parents.
My Lady was present, whose presence made euery ioynt vain tremble within me, in their seueral motion, yet now and then casting my eyes vnto the of her beautie, drew strength from it, to support my weake minde, to make reply to their demaunds: for séeing me so young, in that no hayre yet budded in my face, they comiferated the relation of my troubles, imprisonments, and slaueries: yet this nothing gréeued me (saide I) for cannot remember when was mine owne, and therefore supposing was marked to no other fréedome, did till now patiently beare my slauish bondage, as if had béene borne thereto, and beléeue it will neuer bée otherwise, my fortunes so continued it.
Gladly would haue had my Lady vnderstood it, (so shee might not knowe me) and with what affection did vtter it, as hee that
There was none in all the Court but tooke liking in me, especially my Lord Lysander, that fauored me that night to take mee with him, with swords bucklers, and priuie coates, secretly to walke abroad, crossing the backside of a Gard that leaded him to his Ladie Solesias lodging.
His kindnesse and familiaritie was a meanes that hee did not intreate mee as a seruant, but as if he had knowne me, making mee the Secretarie of his Loues, the surest token of true amitie that may bee in this age.
cannot otherwise beléeue, but that Cupid now at length thought himselfe wronged, séeing Pollinarda so rebellious and cruell towardes him and me.
So she that could not loue Florisiano, Venus sonne with his almightie power, forced to affect poore Iaroe, which name would not change, for vnder that title Fortune had offered me, in obtaining the grace of Troyla Princesse of Argier.
Quickly did Pollinarda expresse manifest tokens of her change, demaunding me whether néeded ought, if yea, my demaund should be the effect of my desire.
Neither was able to answere, nor did euer make known Florisianos great necessities: but rather perceiuing what she ment, as one skilfull in the Art, séemed straunge and regardlesse of her offer, to be more assured of her faith, that after no occasion might frustrate our expects.
My straungenesse effected what wished, for by this, Iaroes Loue had made her more solicit.
doubted not thereof, noting the wooing motions of her eyes.
Oh, they be the swéete silent Ambassadors, soliciting the soules want.
Many times would set my selfe at a window, to ruminate alone the felicitie of my state: then would say to my selfe: Oh, who might deale some of my abounding fauours with disconted Florisiano? Oh Gods, how enuious became the Prince of Apulia, to sée Iaroe so beloued, and himselfe vtterly abhorred.
Oftentimes recounting my many fauors, found them so infinit, that was contented to let the Prince share with Iaroes glorie and happinesse.
One night, (oh happie night among the rest) did the Lady at full make knowne her vehement passions, for being by my maister commanded to watch till one of the clocke, because wee should then walke abroad, got me in that season not farre from her chamber.
thinke there was some false doore, for when was giuing thankes to Cupid for the benefits receiued, heard some busling there.
amazed: and looking what it might be, sawe her that now gouernes my heart, appeare more fairer then Diana.
siluer Candlestick with a Taper she held in her hand.
With cap in hand (for she was my Empresse) ran to take it from her.
Oh loue, to none but whom thou lists thou dost distribute thy fauors.
She plainly (excellent knights) shewed her selfe to be soly mine: for wanting the power to mooue the Organs of her voyce, yet her eyes firmely fixed on mine, she would not let the candlesticke go.
Oh Loues swéete warre! In faith (Noble Sirs) you would haue smiled to sée the bewtious Pollinarda by silence and dumme action, confesse she did loue, acknowledging his soueraigntie, and her tributarie dutie to his deitie, granting those fauours as hostage of her faith, vnto his seruant Iaroe.
Oh do not suffer him (most sacred Lady, said I) so much to offend, that was onely created to adore you.
With this spéech, she perceiued the fault she had committed: whervpon with consent we set the Taper on the table, while she replyed.
The imagination (Iaroe) thou mightest ill suspect, of this my comming thus to visit thée, hath bereft me of all strength and vnderstanding: but that thou mayest knowe wherefore come, it is thus: must haue thée tell me thy proper name, for am sure thou hast some other.
This will not be denied, vowing to kéepe it secret, that thou mayest receiue no harme therefore.
You may well thinke how might stand confounded with her demaund: aunswere could not, which made her more eager to know it.
Againe, she vrged me, that was inforced to say, cannot conceiue (diuine Princesse) why you are importunate to know the thing that will most of all others gréeue you: oh let me not be the cause to renew your sorrow, for will first be my own murtherer.
The amorous Dame replyed: Did imagine to receiue any, would not demaund it: but doing so, assure you, you shall not in any thing more content me, then in that.
Well, for all this, am sure (faire Princesse) the knowledge of my name will vexe you.
Wherefore humbly intreate you to holde this dagger in your hand, that ending my spéech, you also end poore Iaroes life.
Know therefore (soueraigne Pollinarda was borne as said in Carthage, but am called Florisiano: cha~ged it, because heard, that in times past one of this name had excéedingly displeased you, by sleying the Prince
of Calabria: wherefore, séeing how hated that name was in this house, durst not come hither with it, fearing to refresh therewith, the memorie of passed gréefes.
Oh excéeding power of loue, for though (Syr Knights) remembred the things she did most loue and hate, she shewed no whit of alteration, but returning my ponyard, said.
Little néed had you Florisiano, to alter your name for any such feare, knowing that onely for it, the first of the same had bene forgiuen.
Farther shee did not procéede, nor more openly bewray her affection.
dissembled my ioy, sharing it with Iaroe, whom now me thoght began to bee forgot: would therein recompence him for his former kindnesse towards Florisiano.
The time would no longer permit vs to chat, for the houre of my departure being come, was constrained to tell her so.
She was content, aduising me to be secret, because shee would that way often visit me.
imagine (Sir Knights) that you thinke both tongue and soule swore a solemne performance of her deare commaund, and if you so thinke, assure you, your thoughts deceiue you not: for my soule that still hanged vpon her lips, receiued her command, with no lesse sente~ce of the Delphian Oracle: then rising, with a pleasant smiling she said: pray Lord Florisiano, let vs entreate your Turkeship, Christianly to conduct vs to our lodging, and then wéele license your departure.
All rauished with ioy, not able to speake a word, went with her to her chamber doore: and then falling on my knées and kissing her hand, desiring her to account me hers: tooke my leaue, leauing my soule in her bosome, and returned to my Lords lodging: where we prepared our selues for our walke.
He did an act, that iudged most kinde, for he gaue me a garment that had bene mine, saying: Hold Iaroe, for since Fortune robbed mee of his owner, none hath better deserued it.
put it on, and greatly wondred how he knew me not.
Away we went, arriuing to the window where his Lady expected him: stayed to guarde the passage, with such resolution, that all the world, yea Florisiano of Apulia, had not passed there: with the first, and with the fauoured last, was Iaroe now in disgrace, séeing the alteration of his fortunes.
So if with patience you will attend me, the next Chapter shall vnfolde what else happened CHAP.
How the Prince of Apulia ended the discourse of his amourous life to the Greeke Princes, and how Claridiano pittying his estate, departed with him.
WHat strong residence the power of Loues affection hath within an amorous brest (faire Ladies) the beawteous Pollinardas suddain and vnexpected change (which Agesilao bought full dearely) doth amply shew: for not remembring how greatly she had loued him, how bitterly she had taken his death, and with what rigor she procured his reuenge, she recanted, and without consideration of her honours blemish, doted on a slaue.
iust guerdon, that séeing she would not affect the Knight, that with such firme proofes had approoued himselfe to be hers, and by his déeds, worthy of her estimate, she now beheld the subiect of her ioyes, with slauish markes, and that her blinde and vaine passion, might so far excéed as to say, that for the second Florisianos sake, the first had bene pardoned.
There is none that may safely build his assurance on such effects, if once he haue opened his doores to Loues flatteries.
In pensiue imaginations had the Louer put the Gréekes with his amorous Historie, that they would not so soone haue it end.
But the youth that aggrauated his woes with repetition of his former gréefes, abreuiated, saying.
There stayed (Heroicke knights) gazing on the vesture that belonged to the Apulian, till that my Lord Lysander hauing excused himselfe to his lady, of certaine obiections layd against him, thinke it was but some iealous imagination, they would assure all inconueniences, by an espousall contraction, especially befitting them both.
So hee came for me to be a witnesse thereto, but ere he discouered himselfe, he would néeds try the vygor of my armes, comming an other way disguised for the purpose: and being neare me, he drew, saying.
What madnesse hath brought thée to so suspitious a place, where thy boldnesse shall reape no other againe, then a remorcelesse death? was so carefull to let none passe, nor to disclose who was, that without more ado, or other answere, set vpon my dearest friend.
In faith reioyced to sée how wel he behaued himselfe, although knew him not, but being throughly incensed, began to follow him in such sort, that droue him among the hedges of the Orchard, faithfully discharging my dutie.
It behooued him to speake, least some danger had happened, so he raysed his voice, miscalling me therewith, which more gréeued me, then if he had mortally wounded me: for séeing me with eager furie, presse to take aduantage at full to hit him, he said.
Oh Turkish dog, what doest thou? knew my Lord Lysanders voyce, and beléeue me (Noble warriors) was neuer more vexed: but that tendered him as my soule, Iaore had surely kept him from enioying his loues, yet stayed my hand, considering his friendship towards the Prince of Apulia.
So tooke my sword by the poynt, and intreated him to pardon me, for my not knowing him, had forced mee to commit that fault.
The faith (answered he) wherewith (friend Iaroe thou backest thy Maister, brings with it thy excuse, for neuer had any knight a better seruant the~ I: But that thou mayest know how estéeme thée, come, for will haue thée be a witnesse to the faith will plight vnto Solecia, to bee her firme Louer.
Hee bounde mee eternally by the act: And the Moone then shyning bright, it shyned iust in the middest of the Ladies windowe where she stayed: and credit mee, shee séemed bewtifull.
Shee had so affected Florisiano Prince of Apulia, that séeing mee with his owne garments, shee could not but pittie him, calling mee to memorie.
With my hatte in hand (as a seruant ought) stood still, but she called me, saying.
Come thée hither friend Iaroe, for will haue this assurance passe in thy presence, and my ioyes should account compleate, were the owner of thy apparell in thy place.
Oh, if that were so, my deare espouse (sayde my fréende) what greater content could wee more desire.
Towards whom might the blinde Goddesse shewe her selfe more fauourable then to vs, had she now sent vs that valiant knight, crost with so many troubles? Some teares did espie in their eyes, which so greatly moued me, that could no longer dissemble, and going more neare them, thus spake: My very soule would ioy (most soueraigne Princes) although lost this good, to sée that knight here, who is the happiest in the worlde to be beloued of such Princes: for then should fortune neither bereaue Iaroe of this content, (oh Gods could scarce make an end) nor yet should the dispairing Knight be so persecuted by her, as not to enioy your happie presence, by experience sée, with what faith he is affected.
And if you regard him, behold me here, for more troubles yet reserued: And since am eye witnesse of the strongest and purest amitie that can be, oh let the knight in yealow satisfie it with the like, and with endlesse seruice perpetually to honor you.
And wonder not to sée me thus attired, for the successes that haue me befallen, makes me admire how haue escaped with life.
wil not (because cannot sufficiently) expresse (excellent knights) the ioy those Princes conceiued with my sight.
They imbraced me as were their brother, yet had bene so, they could not haue done more.
They plainly had perceiued was inamoured of Pollinarda, since to such manifest hazard of my life, durst aduenture to come to the Court.
He so richly performed the part of a Noble Prince, that knowing desired to be concealed, and not to be intreated otherwise then a seruant, he also séemed content that should affect his sister.
Much better did the faire Ladie take my part, saying.
Beléeue me, henceforth none but wil sollicit Iaroes affaires, which should haue no il successe, séeing he refuseth his other name: so wil procure to redresse the most difficultest, that we may liue contented.
She forgot it not the next day, going to visit my Lady in her chamber, where she found her troubled with many amourous doubts: now misconstring of her fauours showne me, then iudging it not sufficient to my deserts, and her loue.
We departed thence ouercome with ioy, and being in our Chamber, and the Prince laide in bed, betooke me to a window that looked into the Garden, to recount the fauours receiued: where in briefe omitted none, singing vnto the silent night, the pleasure of my conceiued happinesse, vnable to deuise what meanes might choose to be knowne vnto the Princesse.
She was so farre in loue, and therein so much out of quiet (no Louer had euer any) that she ouerheard my song, and thinke she gathered thereby, her selfe had only the power to glad my sorrowfull soule.
And as the Infant Solesia came afterwards, and began to talke of me, she so well dealt for me, speaking more then deserued, that she altogither made conquest of her heart for me: insomuch that she had almost discored it.
For that time the Ladie would not presse her any more, which if she had, Pollinarda would of force explaind her great loue towards me.
That night which was the last of my content, she came to heare Musicke, and as alwaies vsed, tooke my Lute and went to the window, where (not thinking because it was so late any had heard me) began to sing, and openly to expresse the soueraigne ioy of my heart, in this maner.
Oh, who would thinke that Bondage could be Free? That, could beget all gladnes, That, most accurst, could the most happiest bee, That, that which all count griefe, should kill all sadnes, Let all men note these myracles in mee, Whom Loue hath raised from the depth of badnes Vnto the highest, of all high degree, Euen then, when nothing rul'd my soule; but madnes.
Blest be the heauenly powre, whose powerfull might Hath duld the keen edge, of her iust disdaining: And euer blessed be her noble spirit That heard (with pittie) my sad soules complaining: Blest be the griefe of past afflictions night, Sith it, more sweete, doth make my present gaining, Blest be the Tyme, that lent me first her sight, But treble blest the Tyme of grace obtaining.
You markes of bondage: (too) which did inuest Me in these blessings: euer be you blest.
Longer had made my song, but that heard a noise, which not only made me leaue, but also with some alteration to draw my weapons,
not thinking my lifes happinesse would séeke me at that houre.
With my sword in one hand, and buckler in the other, awayted the successe, when in the way accustomed, espied that soueraigne Ladie, so excellent bewtifull, that with her only sight, thought my selfe transported into the skies.
Smiling she came, shewing the heauen of her face full of ioyfull hopes.
Methinkes that straunge, and irefull kinde of entertainment, for her that soly procures thy content: Oh what swéete words? these be they that now féede me in this cruell absence: and more she said thus.
And in faith haue not conceiued small pleasure hearing thée sing, expressing the secrets of thy amourous heart: and for the great loue the Prince my brother beareth thée, wil indeuour (if you tel me who your Ladie is) to get your libertie, that you may better attend her seruice.
It is the condition (most soueraigne Ladie) of all powerfull Loue to pardon none, among which number, he hath from the beginning so subdued my heart, that haue alwaies delighted to treate of his affaires with my selfe, being most alone: although the Ladie adore and idolatrize, be resolued neuer to fauour me.
haue not dared euen from the spring of my loues, to do more then sing the ioy my heart conceiues to account my selfe hers.
And is it possible thou art so cunning in dissembling thy affection? Now by my troth, wert thou to be my gallant, thou shouldest not suffer so many torments.
And beléeue me, there is neuer any thing lost by discouering to the Ladie the interior secrets of the heart, and how she is beloued: for otherwise thus to dissemble, is rather occasion of further euil, because it is likely, (nay it often happens) that the Ladie may place her affection on some other, and so thou loose that benefit, through silence.
haue alreadie set my chiefe happinesse therein (did reply) most beawteous Ladie, and therefore cannot but bee silent, and loue, although die.
Well hath my Ladie vnderstood what require, and how loue: for mine eyes sometimes forgetting their other motions, repairing vnto the heauen of that bewtie for some fauour, are credible Embassadors of the hearts intent.
That is not sufficient (said she) to make her resolue to loue, beeing beloued: for as touching your gazing, that is so common and generall among all men, that the Ladies may iudge it as an ordinarie thing, not considering the owner of those gazing instruments, doth honour and loue her: and therefore it is an error to dissemble, when the paine is estraunged.
If in recompence of the greatnesse thereof, (most sacred Ladie said I) the author of the same should be discouered, and she acquainted therewith, none with more reason ought to do it then I, for there can be none that hath indured so much, nor any loued with such firmnesse.
If there be assurance thereof (replied the Princesse) say thou doest wrong thy Ladie, in not letting her know how she is beloued, if it be with such truth as you publish.
And therfore because haue this day heard know not what of the Princesse Solesia, thou shalt tell me what demaund, and on my faith none shall know it, but whom thou wilt.
You haue no reason to binde me to any thing, (excellent Ladie replied I) knowing will till death obey your commaund.
Why then we shall not so ill disagrée as thought: the thing therefore would knowe, is, thou must tell me if thy Lady be heere or no, and her name withall, without delay and circumstance: for shall thereby receiue the greatest pleasure in the world, and with the contrary, excéeding discontent, which will bee immerited, and no iust guerdon for what meane to do for thée? You may easily conceiue (valiant Knights) what conflicts might indure of contrarious thoughts, not knowing the successe that might ensue, if by telling troth, did condiscend vnto her demaunde.
Somewhat amazed stoode a while, in so much that shee saide: you must not deuise excuses, for it will fall out woorse, if you offend me so.
None did deuise (diuine Pollinarda but rather began to incourage my selfe, to passe my life in your disgrace, for nought else can redowne heereby, but kindle your fléeping wrath.
Bee it what it will, (saide shee) for am pleased with the knowledge.
Why then (replied I) know (soueraigne Princesse) shée is in this Cittie, and of the selfe same name that you are of, in which repitition offend her.
And haue you neuer spoken with her? now did tremble with feare, and then imagined a thousand deuises, yet in the end replied,
Soueraigne Ladie, your excellency so farre vrgeth this matter, that cannot steppe from hence, fearing to méete with death, vnlesse you seeke his lifes ouerthrow that was borne to serue you.
She replied: wil haue you tel me all, for wil take it as one that procures your good, as you haue partly séene.
Whereto answered falling on my knées: Presuming on your Royall word and fauours (sacred Ladie) cannot deny but am yours, imploring pardon for this fault (if it be any) worthie of worse punishment then death.
It did not gréeue her to heare me say she was the Quéene my heart had chosen to imperate ouer it, and my soule: but rather taking holde by my King (the marke of my slauery) which for my pleasure often put on, shée raised me, saying: Very plainely hast thou (Florisiano) exprest thou louest me, and if thy constancie wherewith thou doest it, be as thou saiest, so may enioy a heart so sincere, and second to none, giue thée leaue to do so stil, regarding the secrecy due to my honor, vntil the heauens shall minister those meanes wherewith may asswage thy griefes.
required her hands, could doo no lesse, to kisse them) more glad, then had bene inuested sole Emperor of the wide world, and yet that had not so pleased me.
She commanded me to take off my King, séeing Fortune had now fauoured me, wherto replied: Oh let not your excellency commaund me to put off that thing wherewith the heauens haue begun to worke my ioy, lest Fortune enemy to all content, séeing me no more a slaue, should tryumph ouer my glory: And though be a king in louing, and the most glorious and frée in being beloued, let me kéepe this as a memoriall: am and wil be yours while my life shall endure, the which loosing it in your seruice, will be the happiest and richest losse in this terrene Orbe.
If it be so, weare it (replied the Mistresse of my life) and yet the taking it off, should nothing impaire my affection, which now is only imployed in your Loue.
Thus was the Soueraigne of my soule, weauing this swéete webbe of my life, on the delicate Loome of both our contents, when blinde Fortune Mistresse of mischaunce, being weary and angry that she had helped me that litle moment of time, brought it about know not by what meanes, that our Loues till then became suspitious in Court, nay further procéeds my woes, (Oh cannot without teares say more) it came to the Kings eares: who desirous to be assured of
so dishonourable a déede, as to be beloued of the Princesse, he had hidde himselfe in that roome vnknowne to me that very night: and séeing by experience what he had suspected, he issued forth inraged like a mad ma~.
yet was on my knées, when he came forth, and finding me in that manner, he tooke me by the collor, and drawing my ponyard, said: Oh infamous miscreant, Turkish dogge, hast thou thus wronged the trust reposed in thée? The punishment inflicted on thée, shall bee a sufficient example to all others such disloyall wretches as thy owne selfe.
had no eyes to looke him in the face, nor tongue to answere him, though wanted not hands to shead his blóod, had not my Ladyes and my friend Lysanders displeasure and discontent thereby stayed me.
Hée snatched at her so furiously, that shee almost fell vpon her face, saying.
had not thought (Minion) thy wanton boldnesse would so haue made thée passe the limits of shame and grace, as to bestowe thy affection on a slaue? He cried to those that awaighted without, whereat foure knights rushed in, who straight conueied me to prison, where thoght they would closely murther me: the which had gladly receiued, so shee were not hardly handled, that had so bountifully fauoured mee.
The king did commit her, but knowing our affection had beene no other then he had séene, hee straight (for hee loued her dearely) forgaue her, turning all his rage vpon poore Florisiano.
Oh, magnanimious Knights, with how many millions of brinish teares did bewayle that losse? it was beléeue me the greatest in the world, for none in so short time could bee so happie as I, nor none againe so vnhappie.
Nothing did, but exclaime lamenting, and with woes tormenting my afflicted selfe.
At length, being so many, some pierced the high heauens, moouing the immortall Gods to pittie and comiseration, appointing a meanes on earth to redéeme me: for the Noble Lysander being mooued at my disgrace, by pollicy procured my Gailors to release me of my Irons and boltes, that might escape through a window, and saue my life.
gréeued no lesse to depart from Pollinarda, at that time (though in her grace and fauour) then at first when like an enemie ran from her.
Yea more then this did my friend sollicit in my behalfe: for hee went to his sister, and discouered to her the whole secret of my affaires,
telling her, was the Knight in yealowe, and hee that slewe her Agesilao, then louing her more then now.
neuer would tell any who else was, because vowed it from the beginning, onely to procure her fauour or disfauour, without that regard and respect wherein might bee hadde, beeing knowne to bee Prince of Apulia, and had not your valour and curtesies bound me thereto, none should haue knowne it.
The Lady did not gréeue at this swéete complot of Loue, but rather it kindled in her some new affection.
So was visited in prison from her: which reuiued my hopes, and added new life to my dying powers.
To pleasure the Prince Lysander, my Gaylors tooke from me my gyues.
The Lady Mistresse of my life, knew the night of my departure, and hauing sometimes before written vnto me by her brother, yet then she exprest the vtmost of her Loue: for was no sooner downe in the Garden ouer which the windowe was that leaped through, when among a certaine company of trées heard a noyse.
Supposing it could be none that would do me such pleasure as after receiued, drew my weapons and went towards that place, where was quickly pacified, séeing a knight well knew: who with as much breuety as the case required, tolde me, that my Lady sent me a Letter with money and Iewels for my escape.
tooke all, not knowing how to deserue so much good as at her hands had receiued: and making my answere according to the merits of those déeds, tooke my leaue of the knight and went out of the Garden, and trauelled till thought was out of daunger, and hiding my selfe among certaine stéepie Mountaines, vnripped the Letters seale, and by the clearenesse of the Moone, that then shyned, read it thus.
THe greefe (kinde Florisiano to see thee so depart from her that had lodged thee in her brest, is so great, that it will not suffer me to be tedious, although it bee my onely desire: for seeing that going from mine with such affection, it must rest in thy hands: it were some comfort to me, thus with thee to prattle longer.
But aye me, for Fortune thinking we shuld enioy too great a happinesse thereby, she doth bereaue me of my iudiciall sences and my bteath, yet not so much, but haue strength to say (though not libertie) to auerre, that remaine thine till death: which shall first attach me with his grim pawes, then will grant an other (yea) vnlesse it be to him that hath long since with such zeale and constant loue, obtained and wonne my firme faith.
The Gods preserue thee me, as they know wish, and thou deseruest.
This Letter is it (braue warriors) that comforts me, when my gréefe is at greatest, and this is the foode vnto my fainting life, whose tedious relation, am sure hath wearied you.
Wherto Claridiano said: This kn and my selfe (Noble Prince) haue taken such pleasure at your Loues discourse, that it cannot bee exprest: insomuch, it hath bound me to offer my life in your behalfe, for protest, neuer to put on Armour more, if deliuer not that Lady into your hands, in spight of all the world: wherefore let vs straight bee gone, although it gréeues my very soule to leaue this Knight: but your necessitie forceth me thereto, because her father to bee rid of that care, may marrie her to the brother of the deceased Prince.
That onely is the thing which most tormenteth me (answered the Apulian) for doubtlesse it may happen as you (Sir Knight) haue imagined: and may the heauens recompence what now and hereafter you shall do in my behoofe: and much desire to know who you are, that may venture with more securitie: for all helpes will be necessarie to cope with so puissant a King, and a knight so strong as Astrenio.
By the way you shall know that (said the hastie Gréeke) for daunger now awaites on our delay.
He tooke his leaue of his vncle with more loue, then when Pehous parted from Theseus: he promised to séeke him, if matters succéeded to his content.
They all rose, the Gréeke Prince with Florisiano, hasted to their ship, wherein being imbarked, they launched into the déepe Ocean, where we must leaue them, to bring Claramants to Constantinople.
What happened in the proofe of the Disamorous Tower: and how Claramant arriued, and prooued it.
WIth feare to bee condemned of too much prolixitie, in the amorous discourse of the Prince of Apulias life, being the thing most dread, and onely séeke to shunne: and yet no small trouble did it cost mée to refuse it, to so briefe a summarie as haue the which vrge for my excuse, although it néed not, if it be read by Cupids vassailes: but whilest this is in question, attend (fairest of all faires) most beauteous Ladies, for the triall of the Tower is nothing but Loue.
There was none left, but went foorth to sée it, because the fame therof drew them thither.
So many knights came from the shippes, that the Cittie was not able to containe them all, and euery one so richly armed, that it delighted euery beholder.
The spacious yard was in a trice filled with people: and the Ladies with their beauties, made it more glorious then the heauenly Synode of the Gods.
For the trial, there wanted no knights, in that ere noone, aboue two hundreth shields accompanied the others that were before hung vp, yet none arriued so high as Brandimardo, (sonne to the great Affricano that died vppon the conquest of Lyra, in Rosiclers presence, as was declared in the second part of this Historie.
As the Emperours were about to withdraw to dinner, there entred the place, attended on with a maiesticke companie, a cousin of Abstrusios, no lesse valiant then he.
All in gréen armor hee was clad, brauely garnished with halfe Moones: the deuise on his shielde was a Griffion without head, which in his countrie in battell
As nimble as a Roe he dismounted, ascending the staires in such haste, that euery one thought he would end the aduenture: but arriuing where the deceased Pagan had done, hoe was charged with so many strong blowes, that Galtenor saith he could do no more, then raise one legge to steppe higher, which was the cause that with more rigor hee was thrust out, and his shield placed according to his deserts, next to Brandimardos.
Great honor wonne Salberno hereby, (so was he named) and had in high estimation, for (his Cousin excepted, that was borne for the seas, whose Lieftenant hee was) none could better order a Nauall battel then he, as he shewed it in the warres of Grecia.
The Emperour to fauor the Captaine generall of his Fléetes, inuited him, which they much estéemed, iudging the Gréeke Monarch the absolutest accomplished in all vertues, of any in the whole vniuerse besides: and themselues most happie, to bee ioyned in amitie with such Princes.
Away they would go, when a kinsman of Pollidolpho of Croatia shewed himselfe, whose armes were of an Indian colour full of strawberries.
With gallant brauerie hee went towards the Tower, where hee spedde not so ill, as not to be accounted valiant, for his shield was hung next to the Troyan Oristides.
To dinner went the Emperors, glad to sée what happened in that triall, where they were serued with such maiestie as their estates required.
By themselues sate all the Ladies so exceeding faire, that Paris had doubted to which for beautie hee might giue the golden apple.
Nothing could please the beauteous Archysilora, in absence of her Gréeke, but rather gréeued to sée those feastiuals, missing the presence of her Prince.
She was a thousand times determined to go and séeke him: but shee left it, supposing the fame of the disamorous Tower would draw him thither, thinking that was he that acccompanied the knight of the Lyons, so much shee iudged him to resemble Claridiano.
Great comfort was it to her to communicate her gréefe with Rosamond, that incouraged her as one that was frée of such tormenting passions, and yet sore gréeued for the want of her deare sonne Roselindo, of whom she knew not what was become, and many times shee was about to demaunde the wise men for him, had shee not thought it too much immodestie.
She could not but reueale it to her beloued Dacian, who dissembled it as much as he could, yet not without signes of inward sorrow in his very soule: he purposed to séeke him, first inquiring of his friend Nabato, the place of his abode, the which animated him, perswading himselfe hee would haue especiall care of his welfare, beeing the thing that so neare concerned him.
Dinner béeing ended, and the table taken vp, all that companie of Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Knights, with all the Ladies, came foorth to sée the new commers, that were many, to prooue the Tower.
It was woorthie the trauell, and to be desired, what was promised to the victor.
Wherefore scarce were the Ladies placed, when with Princely grace there entred the Lastorus, cosin to Don and Generall to the Hungarians, and of whom there was good hope.
He shewed himselfe to be no lesse vnbeloued then valiant, for his shield was set next to the Troyans.
So many hasted to the triall, that no sooner one ended, but another was readie.
Among them that best behaued themselues, was the gallant Lusitanian, Archylocus, on Siluerios brother, whose shield was also equalled with the last.
In such multitudes were those shields hung vp, that the Christaline Tower was almost full.
Euerie one conuerted their eyes at one side of the place, because they had espyed the famous Oristoldo Lord generall by land, to whom the Emperour had giuen that honorable charge, in respect of what his father had done for his son, and he for his Nephew.
It was aduisedly done by the Gréeke, for the world did neuer knowe a better, nor more fortunate Captaine, or more skilfuller in ordering of battel, and presenting it in time.
He was beloued of all, and also of the Ladies, although he had not shewne himselfe amorous: for he said, there was nothing more contrarie nor troublesome to him that swayed any publicke commaunde, then to bee in loue, and to bee so, it was necessarie for a man to busie himselfe in nothing but in that new alienation, setting apart all other cares.
Accompanied with most of the Nobilitie came the valiant youth, all in white armor garnished with knots of Gold and Azure.
Mounted he was on a Roane Courser, with Caparisons of colour like his armes, with so many stones, that their light dazeled the splendor of the Sunne, whose rayes reuerberating on them, depriued the beholders sight.
On his head and his owne Burgonet, great plumes of feathers, full of spangles of golde.
In middest of his shield within a groue of trées, hée himselfe was pictured with his hand vnder his chéeke, leaning vpon a bloodie launce, at his féete lay the God of Loue with bow and arrowes, as vanquished by him: on whom he séemed to gaze so carelesly, as if he held his deitie in naught.
Mars and Cupid differ farre, Loue cannot agree with warre: And till Mars and Loue agree, Looke not (Loue) to co~quer me.
None was more gazed on then the braue Prince of Antioche.
Oh, how gallant doth he come (saide Lyriano, who greatly tendred him) and am glad of his libertie, by reason of these Ladies that may well excuse it, for were he in loue, he could not then so well guard vs.
am sorrie (replied Rosiluera that so frée a knight should haue any here to take his part, for knowe not how so great a wrong as hee commits against Ladies by that cruell deuise, may bee satisfied, but by wishing the thraldome of his libertie.
If the world had another Oristoldo (aunswered the Princesse) it were good that this were in loue, and the other the care to kéepe vs. Leaue we this (said Rosamond to sée what will become of his libertie.
By this he was arriued at the Tower, where hee allighted, and drawing foorth his sword, mounted the staires with such courage, that euery one cried out: Lindabrides would be his.
There he stayed, for hee was charged with so many blowes, that hee spedde woorse then any before, although his honour were greater.
His mother and the Princesses that loued him as their sonne, made him come where they were, and there the Ladies did disarme him with such kindnesse, as if he were one of the Gréeke Princes.
am sorrie (Prince Oristoldo that to shew vs your libertie, to these Ladies gréefes, you haue
Pleasant is the sowrest (most soueraigne Princesse) if my will and desire bee considered, although the deuise be against my selfe, the which shall neuer kéepe me from being yours.
Now you haue lost the entrance (said Artemisa you shew your selfe penitent and sorrie for your libertie, but you shal not thinke to haue answered it with such small satisfaction.
The beautie of these two Ladies had something astonished the frée Prince: yet hee replied.
You shal not néed to deuise new punishments for him, that must will be alwaies obedient to your commaunds (faire Ladies) and let it be ynough, confesse haue wronged you, that this acknowledgement may strengthen my excuse, and so lessen my fault, that by purchasing your grace, may hope for an extenuation of my chastisement.
That might be (said Rosiluera were not your offence greater then may bee forgiuen.
No more of this vnprofitable that (spake Archyrosa for his libertie will sufficiently hereafter plague him, as it hath done many others: and let vs now inquire the reason of this tumult: whereat they all looked to sée what it was.
The aduenture is at an end, now the braue knight of the Lyons is come.
All the Princes turned to sée his comming, especially Rosabell, beeing so greatly bound vnto him.
What shall say of Archysilora Quéene of Lyra? the changing colours of her face deuoted her alteration, thinking her Prince came with him.
Alreadie was this warlike Mars past the prease of people, mounted on a mightie bay Courser, whose Caparisons coloured like his armor, were imbrodered with so many inestimable stones, that the riches of them admired the spectators.
On the toppe of his helme and horses head, were large plumes of diuers coloured feathers, that the brauerie of both amazed the whole place, that none doubted his victorie.
The Emperor Alphebo, was he that most reioyced, because he had and did greatly loue that Princesse, whom he so easily could not forget, if she had not béene alotted to his brother.
In middest of whose shielde, was drawne a world round like a globe, by which a knight climed vp, to the toppe whereof he wanted litle, whereon sate Fortune, reaching him her hand, with this motto.
If Fortunes hand be not a stop, will attaine the highest top, The which, if Fortune do deny, Fortune is too blame; not I.
No lesse pleasure was conceiued at the word then the knights gallant disposition: who with admired Maiestie past on, making his horse bend to the earth before the Ladies.
It amazed him to sée such diuine bewtie: he stood a good a good while rapt in contemplation: iudging it the rarest sight in the world: and indéede he was not deceiued, for so many and so faire were neuer séene togither, but there.
would be loth (saide the Princesse Oliuia the knight of the Lyons should detract much time in gazing on our beauties, so that when hée would not, he be forced to loose the forbidden entrance, not for want of valour, but by his yéelding to loue.
There is none heere but wishes his good in all things (spake the Quéene of Lyra for by his meanes we were all made ioyfull.
Oh, let mee kéepe company with such happie knights (saide Artemisa whose disdaine towards Ladies, nor their comming against them so openly to approoue themselues their aduersaries, in Venus lawes, will not diuert their affection from them.
The desire they haue to become Louers (aunswered the Empresse Claridiana helpes them to be beloued: but let vs not not loose the sight of his high déeds: for haue great hope of his victorie.
There is none here but hath the like, wishing it with their very soules (replied Lyriana and therevpon doubt not but he should finde some one heere that would vndertake the combat about the same.
By this the furious youth was arriued at the Tower gate, where he dismounted, and stucke his launce in the ground, whereat hee tyed his horse with such beauerie, that euery one applauded his behauiour.
His shield hee tied to his saddle pummell, and taking his Axe, with soueraigne grace he paced towards the entrance, whose passage many iudged too small, considering his fearefull aspect.
For raising aloft his mightie axe, making the blade shine with her glittering brightnesse, and he beeing one of the best proportioned knights on the earth (so he were no Gyant) for he was nine foot in height, and of most strong and euen composed members, all which were apparant tokens of his excessiue strength.
Scarce did hee beginne to mooue to enter the Tower, when there was heard the horrible sound of new warlike instruments, with such cries and clamors of people, that it séemed a whole hoste was within.
Vpon the toppe of the Tower appeared squadrons of armed knights, whence also were discharged infinit péeces of Ordinance.
Many hideous shrikes, gaue warning that the fierce scourge of their house was come.
This is no impediment to forbid his mounting the staires, for as if hée walked on the plaine ground, he ascended them to the very top, whence new cries rezounded, and newe kéepers were séene to defend him from taking the key of the Tower.
good while he laboured in this rigorous conflict: in the end, setling himselfe strongly on his féete, hée past his axe into his left hand, and with his right hee got the key, wherewith hee opened the Tower gate, whereat a new alarum was sounded, which put the battel in some doubt.
For foure vgly deformed Gyants were placed at the doore, in defence whereof they executed wonders, hauing no other care but to prohibit the entrance.
Oh who would not delight to sée our warlike youth, within the narrownesse of the gate, take the axe by the middle, wherewith he misses no blowe, and that which he executeth, daunts the place with chill cold feare, but not those that were onely set there to receiue them, though the God of battels had discharged then, yet could they not bee greater then these.
Not without great labour and toyle hee thrust himselfe among them, where his déeds were admirable: yet he toyled in vaine, for vnlesse hée cleaued their heads, hee cannot frée himselfe from them, because therein consisted all their strength.
But now Fortune was of his side, and content that beauteous
Princesse should be set at libertie, and end so many her troubles, by enioying him, the heauens had so long since promised her: for laboring in this cruell fight, giuing and receiuing mightie blowes, by good chance hee reached one with the blade of his axe vpon the head.
Hee cleft it downe to the breast, thinking hee had cut a rocke, so hard hee found it.
At the very instant he vanisht out of sight, whereby he supposed their inchauntment lay there.
Wherevpon hee beganne to stretch himselfe at length with his axe, as a cunning maister of his weapon.
Euery one in the place plainly beheld him, for the walles of the Tower were so transparant, that all was séene, what ere was done in the first Hall.
Some alteration did Claridiano féele within her Iuorie breast, remembring what troubles and daungers shee had indured and past, all caused by that Princesse.
And Meridian was also co~founded in imagination of opposed thoghts, which excéedingly gréeued him: for if his sister were liberated, his fathers large Emperie should be hers: but so he might sée her, hee was content for that time to omit those cogitations, and turned his eyes on the haughtie knight, that representing firie Mars within the Tower, had by this slaine another.
The valiant youth made sure account of the victorie, knowing where their strength lay.
So hee extended all his, to end the battell with them, thinking their deaths would ende the enterprise.
Hee made as if hee feared them, that they might with vnaduised haste follow him.
It fell out as hee desired, and so fetching about the ingratefull Athenian axe, hee discharged it with the vtmost of his furie, on the top of the ones helme, that both it and helme was cleaft to the waste.
Hauing thus done, he determined to close with the last, but ere hee cast his armes about him, hee ranne against him so hard with his shoulders, that hee thrust him from him, with more furie then hee had béene driuen by a culuerins shot, and before hee recouered himselfe, the vnresisted axe did hit him on the head, doing by it as by the others.
The Gréeke thought he had now ended his businesse, but it happened otherwise: for two knights of gallant disposition, presented themselues before him, without eyther Armes or weapons, sauing Rapiers and Daggers.
They issued forth on the sudden, but with the sound of millitarie instruments, that gaue signall to a new fight.
The one said: Most valiant knight, séeing the happiest immured within this Tower must not be with Armour, which wee willinglier would haue done, the better to eschew your furious blowes: but wee are commaunded the contrarie: and therefore, we are forced, and dare not but obey: wherefore, if you will terminate the battle, and thereby conclude the aduenture, you must presently put off your Armour, for our Combatte is permitted onely with Rapiers and Daggers.
Somewhat astonished was the Gréeke, séeing he must leaue his Armour, but it lasted not long, because he would not bee taynted with cowardise, and so hee thus made aunswere: am content (Syr Knights) although it bee no good custome, if wee may vse our Armes, to put them off in such necessarie occasion.
At that instant he set his axe against the wall, and vngyrting his sword, and dooing the like by it.
The two Knights had such care, and were so vigilent to watch these two weapons, that hee was scarcely disarmed, when swifter thou an Eagle they presently snatched them away, that his nimblesse was not able to prohibit it.
Hee neuer sawe himselfe in daunger of death vntill now: for they of the Tower with those weapons are become more furious then himselfe.
They said: Dead art thou Knight, for thy fiercenesse cannot deliuer thée from our handes.
Onely with his dagger did the Gréeke youth finde himselfe, wherewith conioyned to his inuincible and neuer daunted courage, hee beganne to defend himselfe, and with seldséene brauery to maintaine what hee had wonne, to the extreame gréefe of all that beheld him: the which, togither with the sorrow conceiued to sée him so disarmed, and my selfe ouerwearied, constraineth mee abruptly to leaue this warre vnfinished,
that after a little breathing, may with fresh courage ende it in the next part, continuing the relation of the rare déeds, both of the famous Gréekes, and valiant Pagans, their Competitors.
And if herein doo commit any offence, let, oh let your pardon and your fauours excéede my faults, and then, Nec Laudare satis, dignas{que} rependere grates Sufficiam, referent superi.

THE Enimie of Securitie OR dailie exercise of godly meditations, drawne out of the pure fountaines of the holie Scriptures, and published for the profite of al persons of any state or calling, in the German and Latine tonges, by the right reuerende Maister Iohn Auenar, publike Professor of the Hebrue tonge, in the famous Uniuersitie of VViteberge· In Englishe by Thomas Rogers Maister of Artes and student in Diuinitie.
BEsides what hath bin added to this Booke, which is apparent, you shal find two faults especialie amended by this impression.
For in a praier sometime the person of one, sometime of many praieng was vsed: which thing, in my iudgement, caused some iar.
For the auoiding whereof haue thought it best to amend that fault, and, trust with the good liking both of the Autor, and as manie as shal reade them, henceforth to vse altogether the plural number in those praiers which are for euery daie of the weeke: albeit the rest are in the singular number, forasmuch as they are praiers for some special persons.
The other is the difficultie properlie to applie diuers of those textes of scripture placed in the margins.
For manie times the places of Scripture were falselie quoted.
But now, how soeuer the Compositor haue set them, if you marke the letters of the Alphabet a, b, c, d, &c. vsed both in euerie praier, and margin, they wil rightlie direct thee to the textes.
Other things besides these are amended, which are needeles to be vttered in this place.
Some perhaps wil mislike the applieng of praiers vnto certaine daies: but for that a better some doe both like wel enough thereof, and laude God for this dailie exercise of their faith prescribed; and also because it is not done (as againe in the table to this booke protest) to tie thee superstitiouslie to our order, haue nothing varied from the former and first impression in that point, doubting not but thou canst, and wilt vse this booke to thy profit, and be thankeful, Farewel.
To the honorable Sir Frances Walsingham Knight, one of hir Maiesties chiefe Secretaries, of the right honorable priuie Counsaile, and Chancelar of the Order, Grace and peace in our Sauior Christ.
THAT THE world was made for man, euen Philosophers, through the instinct of humane reason coulde, and the carnal worldlinges through the often hearing of Gods holy worde can confesse: that man is created for God me thinks there should be none so barbarouslie ignorant, or in this cleere light of the glorious Gospel, so desperatelie secure, as to doubt.
notable cause, were there no mo but that, why dailie, and euermore we shoulde extol, and with diuine praises, celebrate the most sacred Name of almightie God: but manie waies besides are we bounde to doe the same.
For consider wee, either the commandements of God; or his benefits; or the frailenes of our corrupt nature; or Satans snares; or the miseries aswel publike as priuate; or our couenant made with God in baptisme; or the vncertaintie of the daie either of our death or general iudgment, and we shal finde that the least of these things offereth sufficient occasion continuallie to praie, and to praise God.
For touching the commandements, God saith, by the Prophet Dauid, Cal vpon me in the time of trouble, so wil heare thee, and thou shalt praise me; by his Sonne our Sauiour, Watch and praie; by Saint Paule the Apostle, Continue in praier, and watch in the same with thankesgiuing.
Yea, not onlie he commaundeth so to doe, which prooueth the excellencie of the exercise, but also promiseth to heare our petitions, which declareth how surpassinglie sweete, are deuout Meditations, in the eares of God.
As in that afore mentioned Psalme of Dauid, Cal vpon me, &c. Againe, Seeke and ye shal finde, knocke, and it shal be opened vnto you: and againe for al, Whatsoeuer yee shal aske the Father in my name, he wil giue it you.
His benefits are for nomber infinite, for greatnes wonderful, excellent for their worthines, whether we respect the gifts of the minde or the goods of the bodie, spiritual or corporal, bestowed vpon some particularlie, or generalie vpon al men.
Who can declare the goodnes of God (that may ouerpasse the temporal benefits, either common to vs with al men, or specialie bestowed vpon vs before al) who can saie, declare the goodnes of God sufficientlie for creating vs after his owne image; for reuealing himselfe vnto vs; for redeming vs by his deare Sonne; for choosing vs before the foundations of the world were laide; for enduing vs with his holie spirit; and for exalting vs to eternal life? What therfore shal we render vnto the Lord for al these things? Let vs take vp the cup of saluation, and celebrate the name of our God.
If we consider the frailenes of our nature we shal find, that continualie we are subiect to sinning, to offending, to erring, to conceauing amisse of the wil of our God to our certaine condemnation.
There is none of vs al which standeth not in neede of counsaile, of props, and of helpe.
For both we are easie to be seduced, and vnable to doe wel, and weake to resist.
If we would discerne betwene good and euil, we are deceaued; if we go about to doe good, we quicklie faint; If we endeuour to resist euil, we cannot endure, but are easilie ouercome.
The consideration of this frailetie of ours, made our Sauior Christ graciouslie to admonish his Disciples, saieng, Watch and praie, least ye enter into tentation.
Againe, the tyrannie and rage of the diuel is vnspeakeable, and his power mightie, being the Prince of this worlde.
We wrestle not against blood and flesh, but against rule, against powers, against worldlie gouernors of the darkenes of this worlde, against spiritual wickednes in heauenly places.
It behooueth vs therefore, according to the counsaile of Saint Peter, to watch and praie.
For our aduersarie the Diuel, as a roaring Lion, rangeth about seeking whome he may deuoure.
But as the Lion at the sight of a Cocke is discomforted, and at his crowing betaketh him to his heeles: so doth Satan both stande in feare of a godlie man, and flie at his praier.
As Lactantius noteth, Diuels doe hurt but the faint harted, such as the great and mightie hande of God doth not protect, which are prophane from the Sacrament of truth, but the iust, that is, the true worshippers of God, doe the Diuels feare.
What should speake of the tyrannie of mightie men; of the miserie of poore; how wickednes doth abound, and heresies ouerflowe? Wherefore wel may say, as did Nestor vnto his children, Praie, for vnles that God helpe vs we al perish.
Furthermore our couenant made with God at our Baptisme, whereby we promised to forsake the Diuel al his workes, &c. to beleeue al the articles of the Christian faith; and to keepe Gods holie wil and commandement, &c. shoulde driue vs therevnto.
For neither can Satan be resisted; nor our faith manifested; nor GOD duelie honored without praier.
Finallie, omitting al other reasons, which are infinite, the shortnes of our life, the suddaines of Christes comming, his seuerenes in iudgement when he is come, should make vs not slightlie to ouerpasse this noble exercise.
For what auaileth it, though in this worlde we abounde in wealth, excel in honor, haue al thinges according to our harts desire, and then when Christ shal returne we are founde vnreadie, and so lose our soules? Happie therefore is that seruant whome the Lorde at his comming shal find watchfull: and happie are those Virgins which expect the bridegroome with oyle in their lamps.
But that euil seruant which shal saie in his hart, my Lorde wil long be a comming, and so begin to smite his fellowes, yea, and to eate and drinke with the dronken, his Lord wil come in a daie, when he looketh not for him, and in an houre when he is not aware of, and shal hew him in peeces, and giue him his portion with hypocrites, there shal be weeping and gnashing of teeth; and those virgins which are careles and secure accompanie not the bridegroome to his wedding, but are excluded out of the gates, and heare, knowe yee not.
The waightines of these reasons, Honorable, haue especialie mooued me, through the earnest request of some which for their godlie zeale loue vnfainedly, and reuerence, did greatlie prick me forwarde, to bring these diuine Meditations (I cal them diuine, partlie because they are of diuine matters, concerne the glorie of God; partlie for that they procede from a diuine spirit; but in this respect chiefly, because they are wholy, as fewe or no other praier Booke is that knowe, taken out of the pure fountaines of the diuine Scriptures) of the right learned and vertuous of famous memorie Maister Iohn Auenar, into our English tongue.
booke certes most necessarie in respect of the extreeme securitie wherein we liue.
Gratefullie it hath bin accepted hetherto in the Latine and Germane tongues; and now by the working of Gods holie spirit, shal profite verie much, if it be vsed as it should be, that is, if the vser thereof praie, Religiouslie in faith; charitablie being voide of rancor and malice; zealouslie with an ardent affection of the minde; and humbly without pride.
For how can men cal vpon him in whome they haue not beleeued? It is sinne whatsoeuer is not done through faith.
Therefore the praier of infidels is no praier but hypocrisie, and a damnable abuse of good words; neither can it obtaine any thing at the handes of God, according to that of Saint Iames, He which wauereth let him not thinke that he can obtaine any thing from God.
For we must praie one for another; and for our enimies, as our Sauior doth counsaile vs, saieng, When ye stande praieng, forgiue, if yee haue ought against any man, that your Father also which is in Heauen, may forgiue you your trespasses, &c, Againe the spirite of God saith, Forgiue thy neighbor the hurt that he hath done thee, and so shal thy sinnes be forgiuen thee also when thou praiest.
man that beareth hatred against another, how dare he aske forgiuenes of God.
He that sheweth no mercie to a man which is like himselfe, how dare he aske forgiuenes of his sinnes? &c. and for al men, as may appeare in the first Epistle of Saint Paule vnto Timothie.
For what is praier without the same, but a verie babling, and vaine multiplication of words? yea there is no praier, where this affection is not.
For praier is a vehement desire of the hart to obtaine something at the hands of God.
God loketh not vpon the face as man doth, but beholdeth the hart; neither doth he listen to the sounde of the mouth, but to the sighes of the minde.
After this manner doe Christians praie, their affections are bent towardes God, they alwaies hunger and thirst after righteousnes.
For vpon whome shal my spirite abide, saith the Lord, but vpon him which is of a lowlie spirite? The praier of him which humbleth himselfe goeth through the clowdes.
Much better is it for a sinner, to be humble, than for a righteous man to be arrogant, as may appeare in the Pharisie Publicane
It remaineth now, that, as the Auctor of this Booke choase for patrone thereof, not for any defence that it needed, but because others the more willinglie woulde reade and accept the same, being dedicated vnto an honorable person gratious in the eies both of the Nobilitie and baser sort, the mightie Prince, Lorde Augustus, Duke of Saxonie, &c. so mooued thervnto by the singular fame of your honors most virtuous inclination, present the same now translated (for what other paines haue taken spare vpon good considerations, to vtter) vnto your honor, beseeching you to accept this my doing in good part, as my hope is you wil: and then doubt not, being graciously receaued of so worthie a person, but gratefullie it wil be vsed of the better sort, for whose sake haue published the same.
God almightie, which is the father of lights mercy and consolation, from whom euery good gift, and euerie perfect gift doth proceede, blesse your honor, as with accesse of temporall benefits: so especially and aboue all, with encrease of his heauenlie blessings, that long you may liue a godlie Counsailer, to our virtuous Queene, a profitable member to this Realme of Englande, a speciall fauorer of the Church of Christ, and a famous aduancer of his truth and glorie, to your euerlasting comfort, and felicitie.
Preface of Maister Iohn Auenar, Doctor of Diuinitie, and Publike Professor of the Hebrue tongue in the Vniuersitie of Witeberge, taken out of his Epistle before his Booke of daily Praiers, dedicated to the most mightie Prince, and Duke, Augustus, High marshal of the Romane Empire, &c.
THe chosen vessel of God, Saint Paule in his former Epistle vnto Timothie, doth exhort, that first of al, deprecations, supplications, intercessions, and giuing of thankes be made for al men: For Kings, and for al that are in auctoritie, that we may leade a quiet and peaceable life, in al godlines and honestie.
Likewise vnto the Philippians he saith be careful for nothing but in al things let your petition be manifest vnto God in praier and supplication, with giuing of thankes.
By which words we are not onely pricked forward vnto the Godly exercise of praier, but admonished besides, that there be foure kinds therof, al necessary to be vsed euery day.
The first are Deprecations, whereby we beg at the hands of Almightie God, either altogither to turne away his heauie displeasure conceaued through our sinnes, or at the least to mitigate the punishments due for our offences.
Supplications are called requestes, wherby we craue such things as are necessarie either for the sustentation of this present life, or for our euerlasting comfort in the worlde to come.
By thankesgiuing we praise God, and celebrate his holie name for al benefites conferred both vpon our soules and bodies.
In this my Booke haue had special regarde vnto these foure kinds of praier.
For first, for euery day of the weeke haue made a morning praier, containing both a thankesgiuing for the blessed rest receaued, and a deprecation for the escaping of al euils which may happen in the day time.
Then two supplications or petitions, for blessinges aswel eternal as temporal.
Next vnto them are placed two intercessions for men of euerie state or degree.
After them ensueth a praier against the sondrie enimies of Christs Church.
And last of al, an euening praier, containing a thankesgiuing vnto God for his preseruing of vs in the day time, a deprecation that no euil hurt vs in the night, and a petition of his fatherlie protection, is annexed.
And this manner haue obserued in distinguishing the praiers for euerie day.
For it is our partes daily in al our necessities to cry vnto God, as our Sauior teacheth to this purpose, Praie alwaies, be not wearie, And Saint Paule willeth the same, saieng, Praie continually, in al things giuing thanks.
For this is the wil of God through Iesu Christ toward you.
Againe, be not let to praie alwaies, and be not let vnto the death to exercise thy selfe in righteousnes.
Thus did the kingly prophet Dauid, which of himselfe saieth, seauen times a day doe praise thee, because of thy righteous iudgements.
And certes it is a goodly worke to cal vpon God in praier, and to enioy his familiar speech: The which also Saint Ambrose witnesseth, saieng, To praie much and often is a worke grateful to God.
Howe excellent a thing it is for man to intermingle his talke with God, no man is ignorant, and that excellencie is attained by praier onely, which ioineth vs to the societie of Angels, through ascribing due praise and glorie vnto Almighty God, as their office doth binde them.
Hence doth the Psalmist say: In the sight of Angels wil sing praise vnto thee, wil worship toward thy holy temple, and extol thy name.
For in other things there is much difference betweene their condition and ours, whether we respect their nature, or their kinde of life; their wisedome, or their vnderstanding, but to praie is a worke common both to Angels and men.
For praier doth seperate vs from brute beastes, and associate vs with Angels, Yea, an easie matter is it, for one to attaine to their nature, dignitie, wisedome, and vnderstanding, if al his life time, he giue page duplicate] page duplicate] himselfe wholy vnto praier, and the seruice of God.
For if they which frequent the companie of wise men, by reason of their continual meetings, in short space are so changed, that they represent the wisedome of such as they company withal: what shal we saie of them which dailie talke with God in praier? Wherefore it behooueth vs, obeieng the wil of our Heauenlie Father, to spende our life time in the lauding of God, and in deuout meditations.
But he which neither wil praie, nor praise God, neither yet delight in this diuine communication, surelie liuing he is dead without life, without ense or vnderstanding, as witnesseth Saint Chrysostome.
The frute and profite coming by godly praiers doth Saint Iames expresse on this manner: The praier of faith shal saue the sicke, and the Lord shal raise him vp, and if he haue committed sinnes they shal be forgiuen him, &c. Againe, The feruent praier, of a righteous man auaileth much, Elias was a man vnder infirmities, euen as we are, and he praied in his praier that it might not raine, and it rained not on the earth, by the space of three yeres and sixe moneths.
And he praied againe, and the heauen gaue raine, the earth brought forth hir frute.
By these words it appeareth that the praier of faith can obtaine, and bring to passe al things, belonging either to the safetie of the bodie, or saluatio~ of the soule.
As that king and Prophet Dauid by praier repelled the horrible crewe of his mortal enimies.
So in like maner Ezechias the King of Iuda, Ierusalem being besieged by Sennacherib King of the Assirians, gathered not a company of soldiours, but onely went against his enimies in praier, preuailed against them, and preserued the Cittie with the vtter ouerthrow of his aduersaries: Likewise by his humble praier he escaped death, and faithful supplication prolonged his daies.
This made Saint Augustine to saie, The praier of the righteous is the keie of heauen, The praier of the godlie doth ascende, and the mercie of God doth come downe.
So that knowing the dignitie of this familiar talke with God, and considering the commoditie which cometh thereby, me thinkes nothing should dismay a Christian from calling vpon God.
For notwithstanding it exceede the power of man to reason with God: yet doth the holy spirit dwelling in the faithful helpe our weakenes, and not onely emboldeneth vs to approche before his Maiestie, but also maketh intercession for vs with groanes vnspeakeable.
As we reade that women being of nature weake vessels, oftentimes by praier haue apprehended God, detained him, as may appere in the woman of Canaan.
Finally so many occasions are there to mooue, and stir vs daily vnto praier, that sufficiently they cannot be expressed.
And if at any time often praier were needeful, perswade my selfe, that nowe in this last and olde age of this doting worlde, wherein as more grieuous and wofull wickednes doth raigne than at any time: so it is to be feared that in the Church more horrible punishments, and in common weales more miserable confusion wil ensue, than euer did, it should be practised; which euils can by no other meanes be auoided, but onely by dailie, earnest, and faithfull praier.
The fountaine of al true wisedome and learning God almightie, continue among vs for his Sonnes sake the puritie of his worde together with the studie of good letters, maintaine peace and concorde in his Church, and make vs al continually to addict our selues to aduance his glorie both in deede and worde, and to benefite his Church to the vttermost of our power, that liuing alwaies in his feare, we may die in his fauor, and rise againe to euerlasting blessednes.
Praier to be saide at the comming into the Temple.
ALMIGHTIE God, and heauenlie Father, in the multitude of thy mercie we wil come into thine house: and in thy feare wil we worship towardes thine holie Temple.
Lorde, we haue loued the habitation of thine house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth.
Lorde of hostes how amiable are thy Tabernacles? Our soules long, yea and pine away (through the desire) to come vnto thy court.
Wee wil acknowledge thee in a great Congregation we wil praise thee among much people.
Come let vs worship fal downe, and kneele before the Lord our maker.
For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheepe of his hande.
Exalt the Lorde our God, and fal downe before his footestoole, for he is holie.
We wil go vnto the altar of God euen vnto the God, which comforteth our soules: and in an acceptable time doe we make our praier, euen in the multitude of thy mercie: God, heare vs in the truth of thy saluation, Amen.
An earnest petition for the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, that our praiers may be zealous and effectual.
Almightie and merciful God, Father of our Lorde Iesus Christ, forasmuch as it is thy wil and plesure that in al our necessities we should cal vpon thee our God, worship thee, and with yeelding hartie thankes extol thine holie Name, and therwithal hast promised to heare our petitions, we are emboldened to direct our praiers vnto thy diuine Maiestie.
But considering the weakenes of our nature to be such, that we knowe not how to aske as we should, and thou alone both wiselie doest knowe, and effectually canst grant, not onely what we doe desire, but a great deale more than we can thinke vpon, our praier shalbe vnto thee our God, that, according to thy promise, thou wilt poure vpon vs the Spirit of grace, and praier, which may with vnspeakable groanings make intercession for vs, that, not with lips onely our harts being far from thee, but with minde and mouth together, we may vnfeinedlie, as becometh true worshippers in spirit and truth, with a burning affection of the hart cal vpon thee, which art the true and eternal God, and offer the grateful sacrifice of thankesgiuing.
Prepare thou our minds to praier make them zelous, least otherwise we be like such as praieng tempt God.
Therefore in our praiers, let vs not dissemble like Hypocrites, neither boast of our wel doing like Pharisees, to be seene of men, but onely set forth thy glorie, and aduance thine holie Name.
Turne our harts from beholding either images, or strange Gods, or else dead Saints, but let vs worship onelie serue thee in our praiers, which art our Lord God, Creator of al things, sercher of the hart, rich towards al that cal vpon thee
Instruct our minds that we desire not foolishlie vaine, and transitorie things.
But let vs alwaie craue corporal things, according to thy wil, with this condition, If they bring none hurt vnto our soules: and euermore prefer celestial things, which are to be asked without al exception, before worldelie, that our ioie may be perfect in the heauens
Grant therefore, almightie Father, that we may certainely perswade our selues, that whatsoeuer we shal aske at thine hands through faith, we shal obteine the same; and let vs neuer doubt of thy fatherlie affection towarde vs, or bring thy willingnes to grant our petitions into question, but through a liuely faith, and firme confidence let vs constantly beleeue, that our praiers shal effectually be hearde through and for thy Christs sake in whom al thy promises are yea, and are in him, Amen.
Furthermore if at any time our praiers be not granted speedilie according to our wish, giue vs a strong faith, that wee faint not, but may through patience expect thine aide, knowing that coming it wil come, and thy truth wil not linger.
Gouerne therfore our harts by thine holie spirit, that we appoint not a time, manner, or limits of helping vs, but may in al thinges submit our selues to thy most heauenlie pleasure, and commende our praiers vnto thee in hope silence for thou wilt not misse an houre, but wilt come at a time conuenient.
Likewise illustrate our mindes with thy light, that we cast not forth our praiers trusting in our owne righteousnes, but in thy manifolde mercies, through Christ, by whome we haue boldnes by faith, to approch vnto thy throne, to cal thee, Abba Father.
Couerne our harts and mindes, that in praieng we neither presume nor trust vpon our owne worthines, so through pride contemne others, but let vs humblie, and louinglie like brethren praie one for another, that we al may be saued.
Take away from vs al babling and superfluitie of words, that we be not as Ethnikes, which for their long speach, thinke to be hearde.
Assist vs also, that the sight and reme~brance of our owne vnworthines, doe not terrifie vs from praier, and that we be not let by other causes, from ernest crieng vnto thee night and daie, that the wil of thy seruants, and reuenge of thine elect may be fulfilled.
Now therefore, heauenlie Father, and eternal God, giue grace, that in al places we may praie, lifting vp pure handes without wrath, or doubting, and saie, Forgiue vs our trespasses, and with deepe sighings, sure confidence continuallie persist in making of supplications, praiers, intercessions, and giuing of thankes for al men, that, according to thy promise, we may receiue as wel temporal, as heauenlie benefites.
For this is the confidence which we haue in thee, that whatsoeuer we shal aske according to thy wil thou wilt grant vnto vs.
And hearing al our petitions, we doubt not, but that our requestes which at this time we haue made vnto thee by Christ our Lorde; shal in like manner be granted: who liueth, and raigneth with thee in the vnitie of the holie Spirit, a God now and for euermore, ·Amen.
dailie praier for the perpetual happines of our sacred, and most gratious Soueraigne, and Queene Elizabeth.
OAlmightie GOD, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, in thine hands is al power both in heauen and earth, thou confirmest kingdoms, and againe dost alter them according to thine heauenlie pleasure, We praise thee, we magnifie thee, we extol thine holie Name, for that it hath pleased thee to appoint ouer vs, a good and gratious Queene which doth gouerne with counsaile, and rule with wisedome.
Grant hir, we beseech thee, continual peace, long life, and much happines: and deliuer not hir Maiestie into the hands of hir enimies.
Rule thou hir minde and wil, that she may serue thee alwaies in feare, and reioice in trembling.
Let hir maintaine and imbrace pure religion, and defend hir people in the profession of Christes Gospel against al errors and superstition whatsoeuer.
Giue hir wisdome and vnderstanding to doe such things as are grateful in thy sight, profitable for vs hir subiects, and hurtful to none.
God, eternal Father, heare the petitions of our Queene in al hir trobles; the Name of Christ our Sauiour glorifie hir, and the comfortable aide of the holie Spirit vpholde hir now and euermore.
Be mindeful of hir grace for hir good, giue to hir according to hir harts desire, and prosper al hir purposes, that we may reioice in thy saluation, and triumph in the Name of our God.
Blesse hir, Lorde, euermore, that we may know that hir protector is in the cloudes.
Harken vnto hir from thine holie heauens by thy mightie right hande which bringeth saluation.
For though some trust in horses, and others in chariots: yet wil we remember the Name of our God.
They shal fal, and be ouercome, but we couragiouslie wil persist.
Lord protect hir Maiestie, heare vs when we cal vpon thee.
That in thy strength she may reioice, and mightilie triumph in thy saluation.
Grant hir the desire of hir hart: and denie not the petitions of hir lips.
For thou hast preuented hir with notable blessings, put a crowne of pure gold vpon hir head.
She hath asked life of thee, thou wilt giue hir a long life.
Great is hir glory in thy saluation; honor and fame hast thou put vpon hir.
Thou hast ordeined hir for exceeding blessednes, and dost comfort hir hart with thy cheereful countenance.
And why? Because she delighteth in thy Christ, and doubteth not of thine euerlasting mercie.
Let thine hand, Lord, light vpon hir enimies, and thy right hand finde out al such as hate thee, and enuie hir prosperitie.
Put them into a burning furnace in the time of thy displeasure: the Lord in his anger shal consume, and fire shal deuour them.
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seede from the sonnes of men.
Because they intended euil against thee, and imagined mischiefe against the innocent, which they could not bring to passe.
Therfore wilt thou turne them into flight, and bend thy bowes against their faces.
Triumph, Lorde, in thy virtue, and we wil sing out, and commende thy power.
Saue our Queene, merciful God, in despite of al hir enimies, which either secretlie or openlie go about to bring hir life to the graue, and hir glorie to the dust.
Giue thy iudgement, Lord, vnto hir grace and thy righteousnes vnto hir Counsaile; that they may iudge thy people with iustice, thy poore with equitie.
Let the mountaines bring peace, and the little hils righteousnes vnto thy people.
Let them iudge the afflicted among the people, and saue the sonnes of the poore: Make them to destroy the backbyter, that he persist not to afflict the miserable, and such as trust in thy mercie and protection.
So shal quietnes and peace abound among vs like the hillockes on the earth.
Lord, shielde our Soueraigne exalt thine Annointed, let thine hande assist, and thine arme strengthen hir: Neuer let hir foes preuaile against hir, nor the child of wickednes bring hir to destruction.
Banish from hir Court al hir priuie enimies, and preserue hir euermore from dissembling friendes.
Grant this, most merciful Father, for thy deare Sonne our Sauiour Christ his sake, Amen.
Almightie and merciful God, eternal Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, three in persons, one in substance, God in verie deede and from euerlasting: We extol thy sacred Maiestie, we praise thine vnspeakeable mercie, thy diuine truth we exceedingly comend, for that of thy fatherlie and wonderful goodnes, thou hast protected vs this night vnder the shadow of thy wings: yea, thou also hast made vs quietlie to take our rest notwithstanding the dangerous snares of our deadlie enimie the diuel.
Thou art the God which exaltest vs from the gates of the shadowe of death; and from the power of darknes thou deliuerest vs.
Therefore we wil acknowledge thee for thy goodnes, for the wonderful things which thou dost among the sonnes of men.
We wil magnifie thee in the great Congregation and among much people wil we praise thee.
Our harts be readie, our God, our harts be readie: We wil praise thee Lord, among the people, sing to thee among the nations.
For thy mercie is great aboue the heauens, and thy truth vnto the cloudes.
We wil not hide thy mercie and truth in the great Congregation; Because it is a good thing to praise the Lorde, and to sing to thee, thou most High, To declare thy louing kindnes in the morning, thy truth in the night.
Blesse the Lord, our soules, and al that is within vs praise his holie Name: Which forgiueth al our iniquities, and healeth al our infirmities: Which redeemeth our liues from destruction, and crowneth vs with mercie and compassion: Which satisfieth our longing with good things, and protecteth vs from our youth: Which also hath kept al our bones this night, Not one of them is broken.
To thee King euerlasting, immortal inuisible, onely, wise God, be honor, and glory for euer euer, Amen.
God earelie wil we seeke thee; our soules thirst for thee, our flesh lusteth after thee in a barren drie lande, where no water is, to see thy strength and glorie.
eternal God which hast brought vs to the beginning of this daie, defend vs with thy mightie power, that this day we fal into no sinne, but let al our cogitations, wordes and workes, tende to the setting forth of thy righteousnes.
Lighten our minds this morning with the shining and clearenes of thy wisedome, that in our harts, that true day star may rise shine, as it were a candle burning in a darke place.
Giue vs thy Spirit of wisdome and reuelation in the knowledge of thee, And lighten the eies of our vnderstanding, that we may know what our hope is, how great the glorie of our inheritance, and what the excelent greatnes of thy power toward vs. Fil vs with thy mercy in the morning so shal we be glad and reioice al our life long.
Merciful God, endue vs with thine holie Spirit, that we may neither thinke, speake, or doe anie thing this day, but that which may please thee, and tend to the aduancement of thy glorie, and health of our soules.
Gouerne thou our vnderstanding and wil, and so direct al the cogitations of our hart, that we may wholie be thine, and sauor of nothing besides thee our God and Redeemer.
Teach vs the waie of thy Commandements, Lord, and we wil keepe it vnto the ende.
Giue vs vnderstanding to keepe thy lawes, and to loue thee our Lord God with al our hart, with al our soule, and with al our strength: and let al thy restimonies be our delight and Counselers.
Comfort the soules of thy seruants, for vnto thee, Lord, haue we lifted vp our soules.
For thou Lorde art good and gentle, and of great kindnes to as many as cal vpon thee.
Behold God, earelie now this Morning we doe offer our selues a Morning sacrifice vnto thee, a trobled spirit a broken and an humble hart, Lorde thou wilt not despise.
Make vs fit, that we may likewise We see the workmanship of thine hands, the Moone and Stars, which thou hast ordained; and we wil signifie thy glorie vnto al nations, and among al people wil we declare thy wonderful things.
For thou art mightie Lord, and worthie to be praised, great is thy virtue, and thy power wonderful.
We thanke thee, holie Father, God of heauen, because thou hast created by thy worde of power the vniuersal worlde with al the creatures, and whatsoeuer is, liueth, or mooueth in the same.
By thy wisedome thou doest gouerne, and by sending of thy Spirit, as yet doest vpholde, and cherish the same.
For al woods fruteful trees, stones, graine, flowers, herbes, and al the grasse of the fielde hast thou ordained for the vse of man.
We magnifie thee, God most wise, for creating the sea, springs of water by the power of thy worde, and for giuing them virtue to bring forth fishes of al kinde to be eaten of man.
We blesse thee, eternal God, for making the superior and lower regions of the aier, with al birdes, and fethered foules of sondrie kindes for the foode of man.
We glorifie thee, for giuing the whole frame of this earth, with al the creatures in the same vnto mankind, and setting man ouer the works of thine hands, hast subiected al things vnder his feete, Al sheepe and oxen yea, and al the beastes of the field, The foules of the aire, and the fish of the sea, which walke through the paths of the sea.
Especially we praise thee, our Lord and maker, for making vs thy creatures reasonable men according to thine owne similitude; for giuing vs reason and al the senses; and for preseruing vs hitherto.
Thou didst nourish vs that wonderfully being within our mothers wombe, and out thereof hast thou brought vs sound in al parts without imperfection; and yet continuest thy fauor, and dost keepe vs against al dangers, and deliuerest vs from al euil: and al these things dost thou of thy fatherlie and diuine goodnes without any merit or desert of ours: for al which we are bound to thanke thee, to praise thee, to serue, honor, and obey thee.
We extol thy sacred Name, God most high, for separating from the rest a Sabbaoth daie, that so men, cessing from their handie labor, the better might serue, and celebrate thine honor.
Who is he that can recite al the power of the Lorde? or declare al his workes? who can number out al his praises? No man can vtter al his benefits.
Notwithstanding, although we be miserable men, and wretched sinners, and therefore most vnmeete to extol thee according to thy deserts: yet wil we not be stil, we wil praise thee euermore to the vttermost of our power.
We wil declare thy iustice and mercie: and while we liue wil we remember thy goodnes; and at no time forget thy benefits.
our soules praise the Lord, we wil praise the Lord during our life; we wil sing to the Lorde while we haue breath.
We wil be mindful of our maker euen from our youth and seeke him euermore: yea, euen vnto our old age and graie head, God, forsake vs not, vntil we haue declared thy power vnto al nations that are to come.
Praise the Lord al ye nations; praise him al ye people.
For his louing kindnes is great toward vs; and his truth endureth for euer.
Praise ye the Lord in his sanctuarie praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his mightie actes: praise him according to his excellent greatnes.
RIghteous and merciful God, which art cleere from spot and sin, al thy waies are mercie and truth.
We miserable folkes, and wretched sinners acknowledge the horrible corruption of our nature; and with humble and sorrowful harts bewaile our filthines, whereby we haue polluted that image imprinted within vs at our first creation.
We openlie confesse, that manie and great are our sinnes; our offences wonderful; our transgressions are infinite, euen as the sand of the Sea, which cannot be numbred.
For al the cogitations of mans hart are prone to euil euermore.
Lord, who knoweth his sinnes? or who can recite al the transgressions of man? Behold we confesse our offences, and our sinne is alwaies before vs. Against thee onelie we haue sinned, and done euil in thine eies, that thou maiest be iust when thou speakest, and pure when thou iudgest.
Behold, we were borne in iniquitie, and in sin did our mothers conceaue vs; and those our sinnes haue we multiplied in our dailie transgressions: and therefore haue deserued thy iust displeasure with paines eternal.
Notwithstanding we appeale vnto thy mercie, Lord, beseeching thee not to enter into iudgement with thy seruants for no flesh is righteous in thy sight.
For if thou streitlie obseruest iniquities, Lorde, who shal stand? If thou wilt contend with mn he shal not be able to answere thee one for a thousand.
For what is man that he shoul be cleane; and he that is borne of a woman, that he should be iust? Behold, thou foundest no stedfastnes in thy Saints: yea, the heauens are not cleare in thy sight.
How much more is man abominable and filthie, which drinketh iniquitie like water? Behold, Lord, we are al become vncleane, and al our righteousnes is like a filthie cloute.
Wherfore we humbly beseech thee haue mercy vpon vs, God, according to thy great mercy, and according to the multitude of thy compassions doe away our iniquities.
Wash vs throughly from our iniquities, and clense vs from our sinne.
For thy Name sake Lord, be merciful vnto our iniquitie, for it is great.
Remember not the sinnes of our youth, nor our rebellions, but according to thy kindnes remember thou vs, euen for thy goodnes sake, Lord.
Remember thy tender mercies, and louing kindnes, which haue bin for euer.
Remember also that we are flesh, a wind that passeth and cometh not againe.
Therefore, leaue thy displeasure against vs; be not angrie for euer neither doe thou threaten vs perpetuallie.
Deale not with vs according to our sinnes, neither reward vs after our iniquities: but conuert vs, our God of saluation, and turne away thy displeasure against vs. Shewe vs thy mercie, Lord and grant vs thy saluation, for thy Name sake.
most merciful God, we confesse in deede that it lies not in our power to put away, purge our sinnes, and to purchase thy fauor: but onelie it is the passion and most innocent death of thy Sonne our Lorde Iesus Christ, the immaculate lambe, which is a sufficient reco~ciliation for our sins and yet not for ours alone, but for the sinnes also of the whole world.
For his bloud which was shed for vs doth clense vs from al sinne.
And, if we confesse our sins, thou art faithful and iust, to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from al vnrighteousnes.
Wherefore through confidence of this thy mercie promised by thy Sonne, we are bold with deepe sighes from hart to crie, Lord forgiue our offences; remit our iniquities; couer our sinnes; and impute not our faults vnto vs. Purge vs, Lord, from our secret faults
Keepe thy seruants also from presumptuous sinnes; let them not raigne ouer vs: so shal we be vpright, purged from our greatest wickednes, that tasting the sweetnes of thy benignitie, we may be secure and certaine of the remission of our sinnes.
Giue the knowledge of saluation to thy people by the remissio~ of their sinnes, through the bowels of thy mercie, whereby the day spring from on high hath visited vs: that we may perceiue in our minds, both comfort, peace, and gladnes of the holy Spirit, which may begin a new life in vs pleasing thee; quench al the motions of our minds striuing with thy diuine pleasure; and restore in vs the image of thy diuine light which was lost, that being deliuered out of the hands of our enimies, we may serue thee in feare, in holines and righteousnes al the daies of our life through Christ, in whom thou art wel pleased and for whose sake al our works, howsoeuer vnperfect, are acceptable in thine eies, Amen.
OCelestial God, and Father of infinite mercie and compassion, which not onely gatherest to thy self an holy Church in this worlde out of mankinde through the operation of the holie Ghost, and preaching of thy word, but also preseruest the same being gathered, and adornest it with al kind of temporal things, and, which more is, with eternal blisse: We humbly beseech thee, gratious Lord, that of thy goodnes thou wouldest vouchsafe euermore to maintaine this thy little flock embracing, preaching, and professing thy word, through thine especial grace; continue thy fauor toward the same; keepe it in sound doctrine, constant confessing, in the lawful vse of thine holie Sacraments, and in purenes of life, that neither the gates of hel the rage of Satan, nor yet the rigorousnes and tyrannie of this world oppresse the same.
Protect, and keepe this thy boate~ and little Bark tossed among manie perilous tempests, and miserable surges in the raging Sea of this troblesome world, that it perish not being ouerwhelmed.
Vphold thy Church, which is builded vpon a sure rock, and dependeth vpon Christ a sound, and vnmooueable foundation.
Lord of hosts, returne looke downe from heauen and behold, visit thy vine, make it perfect, which thy right hand hath planted, thou hast chosen to thy selfe.
Hedge the same about with thy strong defence, that the branches therof being spred out, and pruned may bring forth abundance of frute.
Conuert vs shew forth thy countenance, and we shal be saued.
Enclose thy sheepe within thine hardles: so shal we be quiet from al inuasion and scatterings, neither can any drawe vs by force out of thine handes.
Defend vs from al such, as seeke the vtter ouerthrow of pure religion; and in place thereof labour to bring in the shameful instauration of blasphemous Idolatrie.
Suffer not thy word, that most cleere and vnchangeable light to be corrupted, or put out by our meanes, but gather to thy selfe through the sound of the Gospel such a Church, as may harken vnto thee; honor, and sanctifie thy Name, as wel in word, as in honest conuersation, that so thou maiest haue a righteous and holy generation, celebrating thy goodnes for euermore.
Ioine vs vnto that company which doth worship thee continuallie; that we may be Citizens of thy kingdome among thy Saintes.
Grant that we erre not from the foundation of wholsome doctrine, answering to the rules of the sacred Scripture: and that we offend not against our conscience; but separate vs from the companie of vngodlie ones, and from the damned crewe of the reprobate.
Let vs not so much as take their names into our mouthes which poure out heapes of blasphemies to thy great dishonor, and defacing of the truth: vnto whom thy Sonne is a destruction and stone of offence.
For they despise his base estate, and the foolish preaching of thy Gospel, and the deformed shew of the Church, placed in the middes of al kind of miseries, they loath and abhor, preferring vncertaine riches, lordlie auctoritie, and the vaine pleasures of this transitorie world, before the profession of the truth: and so, making war with thy Sonne, they doe purchase euerlasting destruction vnto themselues.
Keepe vs euermore, that we may abide in that Church, which is truelie Catholike, consisting of members of many nations, but linked vnto thee in one, and the same confession.
Sanctifie vs with thine holie Spirit, that, our sinnes being forgiuen, we may take another trade of life, in acknowledging thee to be the onelie true God, and Iesus Christ whome thou hast sent.
Giue vnto thy Church resting places, and nestes where they may sound thy sacred Gospel purelie without corruption.
Suppresse the diuel which spreadeth blasphemies against thy doctrine: that so neither feined Gods may be erected, nor superstitious inuocations confirmed, nor thy glorie defaced.
Weaken the power of thine enimies, which boile in hatred against thy truth, and conspire the death of thine elect: so neither shal stables of woolues be made, nor dennes of theeues established.
Lord God returne and quicken vs: so shal thy people reioice in thee.
Let al such as trust in thee reioice, and triumph for euer: dwel thou in them, and let those which loue thy Name, reioice in thee.
Lord, remember not our offences, thou which wast somtimes merciful; And forgauedst the wickednes of the people, and hidedst al their sinnes; Which with drewedst al thine anger, and turnedst from the fiercenes of thine indignation: Be mindful of thy woonted mercie, and receiue vs into thy fauor.
For we depend vpon thee alone, being destitute of al worldlie aide, our trust wholie is in thee, and al our confidence resteth in thy stretched out arme.
Lorde, couer vs with thy grace, as it were with a shield, that so we may be blessed; and abiding in the house of thy congregation, may acknowledge, and cal vpon thee according to thy word reuealed, and praise thee euermore, through our Lorde Iesus Christ, Amen.
Almightie, and merciful GOD, which through thy Sonne our Lorde and Sauior Christ, hast commanded vs to praie that laborers may be thrust into thine haruest: we beseech thee by the same thy Sonne, that thou wilt send into thy Church faithful ministers, and syncere Preachers of thy worde, and those in number many, and in operation woonderful.
Giue vnto vs such teachers, as are both in thy mysteries learned, and for their conuersation, co~mended.
Direct them being illuminated with thine heauenly light, that they may rightlie deliuer and diuide vnto vs the principles of true doctrine, the worde of truth, and the Gospel of life; and open the difference betweene the Lawe and the Gospel; and preach those things which are agreeable vnto the rules of faith; and can strengthen vs to beware of the leauen of the Pharisies and the contagious doctrine of mans traditions.
Giue vnto vs euermore syncere Preachers, and sounde interpreters, and arme them with the gift of tongues for the propagation of thy doctrine, that many through their labors and diligence may be conuerted to the true knowledge of thy diuine pleasure.
For how should we heare without a Preacher? And how should men preach except they be sent? Wherfore send into thy Church most louing Father, Byshops of thine owne instructing, good shepherdes, sound Preachers, faithful workmen, godlie ministers, which may faithfullie ouersee and by thy word of saluation luckilie gouerne thy Church, being deerelie bought with the precious blood of thine onely Sonne: So shal the Gospel, thy pure word to the praise and glorie of thy Name; to the saluation and profit of many men with good successe fruitefully be declared, and vniuersallie preached throughout al the world.
Giue vnto vs, Lord eternal God, teachers of righteousnes, which reteining the forme of wholesome doctrine may informe vs in al spiritual wisedome of thine essence and diuine pleasure; and through thy Spirit and word bring vs vnto perfection, whereby we may be blameles both in Christian religion, and in behauior: that they may reduce sinners into the way of truth; strengthen the weake in faith; and comfort the afflicted and wounded consciences against al the darts of our deadlie enimie: Which may be able to exhort by sound doctrine; whereby the hartes of men, being terrefied through the sense of Gods indignation, and oppressed with cares, may finde true consolation: and which are able to conuince the gainesaiers of the truth, and stop the mouth of the impudent; which may be examples for the faithful both in speech and conuersation, and may become al in al to gaine manie vnto thee our eternal God: And may reioice in affliction fearing neither the hatred, nor the ingratitude of this world; but may persist vnto the death constantlie in the confession of the truth: so shal both offences be shunned, thy most holie name glorified and thy ministerie which thou hast instituted for the safetie of our soules which beleeue, notablie made of, mainteined.
Make them perfect therfore, that they may proue the vessels of thy mercie, and profitable instruments of thy Church: let not their labors be in vaine, but take good successe in the Lord.
Grant likewise, holie God, that al the Preachers of thy word may be blameles not subiect to manifest impietie, but the husbands of one wife; shunning extrauagant and filthie lustes, also be they watchful ouer the flock co~mitted vnto them, least the Diuel priuily make a praie of thy sillie sheepe.
Be they sober and temperate, looking to their charge with great discretion: Modest and of good behauior, endued with al grauitie; liberal toward exiles, and al such as are persecuted for the confession of thy word; apt to teach; no quarelers; not giuen to filthie gaming; patient sufferers of iniurie, voide of contention and couetousnes; wise gouernors of their owne houses, hauing children in subiection with al reuerence: Not puffed vp; no giuers of occasion of offence either in worde or deede, whereby any may iustly be offended, and carpe at the ministerie: But in al things let them shew out themselues, as the ministers of God in much suffering, in affliction, in extremities and trobles, and neuer forsake their calling either through persecution, or the manifold ingratitude of the world.
Keepe vs, louing Father, from euil workmen in thy vineyard, from vnfaithful hirelings, which preach and feede themselues studieng to please men, and to get popular credit, turning religion according to the wil of men for their owne gaine, making marchandise of the word by transforming the Gospel into an external pompe and meanes to liue by.
For these men can neuer continue constant in the confession of true doctrine, but are like reedes tossed by the wind, and are easelie broken through the feare of perils which accompanie the ministerie, Amen.
Most gratious GOD, which of thy meere compassion, and diuine pittie, hast purelie and plainelie deliuered vnto vs thy healthful word, which is the foode of our soules.
For the Gospel is the power of God vnto saluation to al beleeuers; euen as thy Sonne doth say Blessed are they which heare the word of God and keepe it: Againe He that keepeth my word shal not die eternallie: We humblie beseech thee on the behalfe of al hearers of thy word, Open our harts vnlock the eares of our vnderstanding, that hearing thy worde profitablie, we may obserue, learne, and embrace such things, as are necessarie to the confirming of our faith, amendment of life.
Let thy word therefore abide plentifullie among vs in al wisdome; giue vs thine holie spirit, that we may heare Sermons, not as the words of men but as they are in deede the word of God; and walking worthie the same, as becommeth the Sonnes of God, may liue in al godlines and honestie, vsing thy word preached vnto the edification of our consciences; to our instruction, to the comfort of our minds, and to the kindling of good motions, for the better seruing of thee in Christian patience: that we be not idle hearers onely but ernest fulfillers of thy word.
Bring to passe we beseech thee, Lord, that the word thy seede may stick in our harts, and take deepe roote: and that the dunging of our cold, and vnfruitful ground may become profitable, let vs both outwardlie embrace thy doctrine with a care, and inwardlie feele the operation therof in our minds: and so, rushing out of the bowels of the earth, and deliuered from tentation, bring out plentiful fruite to the glorie of thine holie Name.
Worke so within vs, that the Diuel take not away the seede of thy word sowen in our harts: let it not waxe barren, neither let vs be forgetful nor like vnfruiteful hearers, which heare thy word to their iudgement, and greater condemnation.
Furthermore, keepe vs in thy faith and feare, that come what crosses and aduersities there can, we may continually stick vnto thee in al our miseries.
Likewise aide vs, God of our saluation, that the seede of thy word be not choaked among vs through cares, riches, and pleasures of this world.
And finallie assist vs, that we be neuer found in the companie of mockers into whome the Diuel hath entered, and blinded their minds and therefore make a so of at the preaching of thy word, which walking after the lusts and desires of their owne flesh, doe wrap themselues in the horrible confusion of their owne desires, and shameful wickednes, whereby like mad men they cast themselues headlong into euerlasting destruction.
Christ, Sonne of God, fountaine of al mercie and compassion, which art the Lorde of the whole flock, and chiefe Byshop of our soules, worke thou effectuallie by thy ministers, speake within vs vnto our harts the voice of thy Father: grant that we may truelie discerne the same, and distinguish it from the howling of woolues.
For thy doctrine is pure, conuerting the soules; the testimonie of the Lord is sure, and giueth wisedome vnto the simple.
Grant therefore, that al of vs hearing thy word may receiue the same to our learning, amendment, comfort, and instruction, which is in righteousnes and in an honest, and good conscience, that hauing heard the same we may keepe it bringing forth fruit with patience, and continue in the same al our life time, and neuer be tossed or carried about with euerie winde of doctrine.
And thou holie Spirit, eternal God, kindle our cold harts with the fire of thy loue, cherish vs with thine healthful heate, and purge the filthines of our corrupted nature: keepe vs in thy lap, and worke within vs righteousnes, and a life acceptable in thy sight.
Regenerate, and transforme vs into newe men; make vs diligent in the study of thy word; beate into our minds a true feare, and loue of thy name, that al vncleannes, and superfluitie of malice being cast off, we may receiue with meekenes thy word ingrafted, which is able to saue our soules, in this world by inchoation, hereafter in ful perfection, Amen.
MErciful GOD, louer of mankinde, which hast forewarned vs of thine vnspeakeable goodnes to take heed of false Prophets, comming vnto vs in sheepes clothing, being for al that inwardlie rauening woolues: And forasmuch as in the latter daies, wherein we liue, it was prophecied there should be perilous times, wherein the Diuel doth transfigure himselfe into an Angel of light: and false teachers with subtile workemen, hauing put on the person of Christ and of his Apostles doe transforme themselues into the ministers of righteousnes, carrieng the shew of godlines, but denie the power therof: And besides, sith by thine holie Spirit thou hast foretold that the wicked man the sonne of perdition, should come and carrie awaie many vnto eternal death, and perpetual damnation: Grant, merciful God, that embracing the loue of thy truth we may shun al spirits of lieng together with al errors and shew of falshood, and at no time be carried away from the true sense of thy worde, neither wander from the scope of our saluation; but perseuering constantlie and firmelie vnto the ende in thy word, may abide in the vnitie of the true catholike faith, Christian religion; and be neuer deceaued any waie, neither by signes, nor miracles, nor lies, neither by anie deceaueablenes of vnrighteousnes through the craft and subtiltie of men whereby they beset vs, but, following thy truth simplie in loue, may continue salfe from al corruption, and constant in the profession of the truth.
Keepe vs, omnipotent and eternal God, from al fanatical opinions; from seducing spirits, which sowe errors, and deadly contentions in thy Church; from false teachers, which priuilie bring in pernitious heresies and denie euen the Lord which hath dearelie bought them; By whom the waie of the Lorde is il spoken of; and which make sale of their hearers through couetousnes.
Keepe vs from greeuous and greedie wolues, which spare not the flock, but cruellie deuour thy beloued sheepe, through the poison of their liues, and erronious doctrine: From men speaking peruerse things, to draw disciples after them, and to engender schismes to the tearing in peeces the vnitie of the Church: From men of wicked and corrupt opinions raising dissentions sondrie offences: From tares which the enuious man, which is the Diuel, soweth and scattereth among good wheat· From false Prophets which speake the visions of their own hart; not from the mouth of the Lorde; which preach their owne dreames and fancies, seducing the people with lies: From theeues and robbers of soules; which kil both bodie and soule, and cast them headlong into hel fire.
Deliuer vs from the rage of the Diuels thine enimies, which in their members vtter out most horrible outcries against the truth; and departing fro~ the rule of thy doctrine, propose the fained opinions of their owne inuentions manifestlie repugnant to thy Commandements.
Keepe thine elect in this most wicked world, that being seduced into foule errors, they swarue not from the truth.
Shorten the euil daies of this dangerous and troblesome time.
Dispatch that sonne of iniquitie by the breath of thy mouth, and cut him of through the brightnes of thy comming.
Cause thy word, God, to sound in our eares purelie and syncerelie; and make vs to follow the same with our whole hart; true faith; Christian obedience! and throughlie to vnderstand the manifold precepts of thy pure word: that so approuing the good, we may shun the waies of strangers leading from the right waie.
Be thou our shepherd, eternal God so shal we want nothing: put vs in the places of thy greene pasture, and bring vs vnto the waters of comfort; leade vs in the pathes of righteousnes for thy Name sake, that we may haue hope, and not be confounded in that daie when thy Sonne our Lord shal appere, which liueth with thee and raigneth in the vnitie of the holie Spirit, a God for euermore, Amen.
Almightie, and eternal God, Father of our Lorde Iesus Christ, which together with thy Sonne and the holie Ghost, didest create man after thine owne likenes, and breath into him the breath of life, the which through thy goodnes continues at thy pleasure: Thou hast made of one blood al mankind, and assigned times, and length of our life in this worlde: Thou giuest life to the people on the earth, and breath to the walkers therein which if thou take away they shal depart, and be turned into dust: We blesse thee heauenlie Father, and with al our harts giue thee thanks not onelie for sauing vs this daie from dangers: but also from our cradels for defending both our soules and bodies from death.
Wherefore magnifie the Lord, our soules and our spirits reioice in God our Sauior.
For he hath looked vpon the basenes and affliction of his seruants.
He that is mightie hath done for vs great things; and holie is his Name.
Wherfore we wil praise the Lorde for euermore, because his mercie endureth from generation to generation on such as feare him.
We wil shew forth his power in the euening, and when we go to bed we wil remember his mercie.
Arise now our soules, in the night praise your God: In the beginning of the watches poure out your harts like water before the face of the Lord.
The Saints wil be ioieful with glorie and sing loude vpon their beds.
We wil praise thee continuallie and wil confesse thy name for euermore: for thou art the God which delighteth our harts, and maketh merie our soules.
Therefore in the night we wil thinke vpon thy benefites; and our spirits shal consider of them.
For thou hast commanded that thy mercie be celebrated in the day time, and thy truth in the night.
our Lord, and God of mercie gentlenes, patience, pittie, truth, which shewest mercie vnto thousands, and blottest out al our offences: we lift vp our soules vnto thee, and from our harts we pray, put not before thine eies the horrible confusion, vncleannes, and wickednes of our mindes, being replenished with lothsome darknes and ignorance, ful of doubtings and errors; our harts and wil are turned from thee our God; and al the powers and strength both of our soules and bodies are defiled, and filthilie weakened: But Lord, of thy great mercy blot out our offences, looke vpon the trobles, and dolor of our harts, and forgiue al our sinnes.
For lo, our soules are wounded, and can not be holpen but onely through mercie.
There is no health in our flesh because of thine anger: neither is there rest in our bones, because of our sinnes.
For our iniquities haue gone ouer our heads, and as an heauie burden haue pressed vs downe.
Our wounds are putrified, and corrupt because of our foolishnes.
Asswage thine anger and turne from thine indignation; pardon our faults; remit al punishment; and restore in vs the light of thy goodnes, which was lost.
Lord, heare Lord, forgiue, harken, our God; for thine owne sake: for thy Name is called vpon by vs. God of heauen and earth, in this euening tide doe we cal vnto thee, that remitting our sinnes, thou wouldest receiue vs into thy protection, and keepe vs this night, that the diuel haue no power ouer vs. Be thou watchful ouer vs, eternal Sauior, least the subtil tempter apprehend vs.
For behold, whether we sleepe or wake; whether we liue or die, we are thine: thou art our creator and redeemer.
Stand therefore on our behalfe in the watch with the armie of thy celestial warriers thine Angels, which, being filled with perfect goodnes, and perpetual integritie, behold thy face alwaies in the heauens.
Expel from vs and our houses wicked spirits, which be our mortal enimies, that they damage vs in no case: and deliuer vs from persecutors, which laie snares for our destruction.
Turne not away thy mercie and truth from vs. God assist vs, that peaceably we may rest, and sleepe in quiet.
We wil lay vs downe in peace slepe: for thou Lord alone makest vs to dwel in safetie without danger.
Hide vs in thy Tabernacle, Lord, that sitting in thy secret place, and abiding vnder the shadowe of thy wings, we may saie vnto thee, Lorde thou art our keeper, and our refuge; God we wil trust in thee, and wil feare no danger.
And although we were in extreeme darknes: yet wil we not feare.
Though we should walke in the mids of the shadow of death: yet wil we dread none euil.
For thou art with vs: thy rod and thy staffe they doe comfort vs.
Let thy mercie, God, follow vs al the daies of our life, that we may dwel in thine House in longnes of daies; praising thee euermore with the Sonne, and holie Ghost one true God raigning worlds without ende, Amen.
BLESSED be the Lorde God, which alone doth woonderous things; and blessed be the name of his Maiestie for euermore, which hath set the Sunne to lighten the daie, and ordained the Moone, with the course of stars to go before the night.
most hie God the day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast framed the light and the Sunne.
By thine vnspeakeable wisedome thou hast distinguished the daie and the night; and so hast thou decreed, that while the world shal last, this course of times and daies shal neuer haue an ende: so that man in the night may rest, and againe when daie comes, go about his busines, and labor vntil the euening.
Lord thy truth endureth for euer; thou laiedst the foundation of the earth, and it endureth; by thine appointment the daie doth last: for al are thy seruants.
For these and al other thy benefites we praise thee greatlie; giue thee thanks for thy exceeding glorie: euen as it becometh vs euerie daie to preuent the Sunne rising, to blesse thine holie Name, and to worship thee at the appearing of the daie star.
We extol thine infinite goodnes in like sort for keeping vs this night past both from the power and tyrannie of Satan; from the snares subtiltie of al our enimies; and finallie from dangers both of soule, and bodie.
For of thy singular goodnes and fatherlie care thou hast made vs quietlie to sleepe and rest this night; againe thou hast suffered vs to awake, and opened our eies, giuing them power to see, and behold the morning light which now appeareth.
Therfore we wil sing of thy power; praise thy mercie in the morning: for thou art our defence, and refuge in the daie of our troble.
our helper we wil praise thee with al our harts, and glorifie thy Name for euer.
For great is thy mercie toward vs; thou hast deliuered our soules from the lowest graue.
Hadest not thou bin our defence, innumerable euils had ouerwhelmed vs: so that we should not haue risen to praise thy Name.
Had not thy word bin our comfort we had without doubt perished in our affliction: Wherefore we wil not for euer be forgetful of thy iustifications: for they haue reuiued vs. Vnto thee Lord wil we list vp our eies on hie from whence our helpe shal come.
Betimes in the morning doe we cal vpon thee, that thy mercie may preuent vs, and thy goodnes ouertake vs quicklie.
Let thy fauor preuent vs as doth the Sunne, which rising spreadeth his beames ouer al the partes of the earth; and as the light of the morning when the Sunne appeareth, earelie when it shineth without the cloudes.
After the same sort giue vs thy cleerenes, and shew thy countenance ouer vs; that lightened by thy word, we may walke al this day long circumspectlie and warelie in the waies of thy commandements, that, being blinded in the daie time, we runne not into darkenes, neither grope at noone day as in the night wandering from the pathes of thy iudgements.
God be merciful vnto vs, and blesse vs, shew vs the light of thy countenance, and be gracious vnto vs: That we may know thy way vpon earth, and thy sauing health among al nations.
most merciful GOD turne thine eies of compassion vpon vs and haue mercie on vs. Looke vpon vs with thy fauorable cou~tenance, and turne not thy face from thy seruants.
Open our eies that we may consider the wonderful things in thy Lawe; and make vs in the morning to behold thy glorie.
God, guider of our life forsake vs not; neither giue vs a prowd looke, and turne from vs the filthines of desire.
Remooue from our harts al concupiscence, and take from thy seruants too ouerbolde a stomack; suffer vs not to run headlong into riotousnes, and bellichere; let not vnlawful loue ouercome vs, and giue not thy seruants ouer into impudent mindes.
Turne our eies that they behold no vanitie, and strengthen vs in thy waie; grant that the offences in this world ouerthrow vs not.
Beholde, Lord, our soules lust after thy saluation, and we long for thy worde; We beseech thee, Lord, with a most ernest affection, and humbly craue at thy merciful hands, that this daie, and euermore thou wilt keepe vs, and al ours from the arrow flieng in the daie, from the pestilence and plague that destroieth at noone tide.
Hide vs vnder thy wings, and vnder thy feathers we wil haue hope.
Blinde the eies of our enimies that they see not; and make their loines alwaie to tremble.
But open thine eies ouer vs, and be thou vnto vs a mightie protector this daie, a firmament of strength, a couering against heate and parching, a shadowe at noone tide, a defence from offending, an assister from falling, a comforter of our soules, a lightener of our minds, and a giuer of health and happines in Christ our Lorde, Amen.
Iesu Christ, Sonne of the liuing God, which art the eternal word that was in the beginning: the true substantial image of thine eternal Father; the character and brightnes of his glory: begotten of him before al worlds, of one vndiuided essence, of like maiestie, and equal glorie: We worship thee, light of lights, verie God of verie God, begotten not made, of one substance with the Father by whom al things were made.
We thanke thee for al thy benefits generallie, speciallie for that at an appointed time according to the eternal counsaile, and decree of the Father, thou didst voluntarilie for vs men, and for our saluatio~ descend from heauen; and was incarnate by the holie Ghost, borne of the vnspotted and pure virgine Marie; and truelie toke our flesh vpon thee; and saued vs miserable, wretched, and damned sinners; and deliuered vs from death, and power of Satan, not with golde and siluer; but by thine holie and precious blood, and by thine vndeserued passion and death, and that of thine infinite goodnes and mercie without any merits, or worthines of ours.
For al which we yeeld thee most hartie thanks, as we are bounde.
For thou alone being iust hast satisfied by thine obedience the iudgement of the Father; and, on our behalfe offering the sacrifice of thy bodie, hast deliuered vs from the tyrannie of death, whereby we were held captiues.
For so great was the displeasure of thy Father against our sinnes, that no creature could asswage the same, but thou alone, onely begotten Sonne of God.
Christ most merciful God, how inestimable is thy loue towards al mankind; how infinite and vnspeakable thy goodnes; how woonderful thine humilitie.
For thou being iust didst die suffer for the vniust.
greater loue can no man haue, than to giue his life for his friend: but thou commendest thine abundant, most burning affection toward vs, in that, being voide of al fault, thou wouldest suffer death for our sakes, being as yet strangers thine enimies, and hast reconciled vs by thy death vnto thy Father, and appeased his most heauie displeasure, forgiuing al our sinnes, and cancelling the hand writing which was against vs, which was contrarie vnto vs hast taken it out of the way, and fastened it vpon the crosse: And hast spoiled principalities and powers, and made a shew of them openlie, triumphing ouer them by thy selfe, and by thy profitable arising againe from the dead hast repared our true righteousnes which consisteth in the forgiuing of our sins: and hast made vs acceptable to thy Father, whereby wee please him through our reconciliation: thou dost comfort our harts by the preaching of thy Gospel, which worketh in vs the beginning of eternal life, and by thine holie Spirit thou kindlest in vs like motions vnto thy selfe, whereby we please thy Father through thee and thine obedience.
Lord Iesu Christ, lambe of God which takest awaie the sins of the world, haue mercie vpon vs; thou which sauest vs through thine owne merit virtue, grant vs thy grace, that the fruit of thy most sacred passion, may worke effectually and profitablie within vs; let not the labor which thou hast taken, the paine that thou hast suffered for our redemption be in vaine through our vnthankfulnes.
thou eternal intercessor, word of God, and his wisedome, which outwardlie speakest vnto vs by the preaching of the Gospel, instruct inwardlie our troubled harts by thy liuely word, and effectual consolation, that being mindful of thy sacrifice and suffering for our sinnes, we may feele true comfort and peace of the holie Spirit in our harts.
Kindle in our brests a liuelie faith depending vpon thy benefits, that being deliuered from the feare of hel, we may finde righteousnes in thee, eternal life.
For thou didst suffer for our sinnes, rise againe for our iustification, that liuing we shold her after not liue to our selues, but to thee which diedst, and rosest againe for vs. Grant therefore that likewise being quickned we may rise againe from al our sinnes, and liue in thee; and may be thine properlie abiding in thy kingdome, serue thee with a willing minde in righteousnes and true holines: so that at length in the latter daie we may rise againe with our bodies vnto a blessed life, and so both in bodie soule being redeemed from al euils, in perpetual blisse happines may triumph with al thine holie Angels, Patriarches, Prophets, and al thine elect, and endued with vnspeakable and euerlasting ioie, may praise thee our Sauior, which hast ascended aboue al the heauens, sittest at the right hand of God the Father almightie, with whom thou liuest and reignest for euermore, Amen.
Eternal God, and heauenlie Father, which art Alpha, Omega, the beginning the ending: thou art the cause, and absolute perfection of our life and saluation: the euerlasting and infinit good, from whom proceedeth euerie good giuing and euerie perfect gift, to wit from the Father of lights, with whom is no variablenes, neither shadowing by turning: We beseech thee in the Name of our Sauior Christ thy Sonne, that through thine holie Spirit thou wilt plant in our harts a true knowledge of the same thy Sonne, and keepe vs therein euermore; make it plentiful and prosper euerie daie, that replenished with the knowledge of thy wil, in al wisedome and spiritual vnderstanding, we may walke worthie the Lorde, pleasing thee in al things, being fruitful in al good works, and encreasing in thy knowledge: strengthened in al might through his glorious power vnto al patience, and long suffering with ioiefulnes: and may abounde in faith, and word, and knowledge, and al diligence.
For this cause we bowe our knees vnto thee Father of our Lorde Iesus Christ (of whom is named the whole family in heauen in earth) that thou wilt grant vs according to the riches of thy glorie, that we may be strengthened by thine holie Spirit into new men; that Christ may dwel in our harts by faith; being rooted and grounded in loue, may be able with al Saints to comprehende the true knowledge of thine essence and wil, according vnto thy word reuealed.
No man hath seene thee, God, at anie time; neither hath anie behelde the countenance of thy Maiestie.
For no man knoweth the Sonne which is of thy verie substance, but thou the Father alone; neither hath any knowen thee but the Sonne, he to whom he doth reueale thee.
Wherefore we beseech thee of thine infinit goodnes and mercie draw vs vnto him, let him bring vs vnto thee.
Giue the knowledge of saluation to thy people, by the remission of their sinnes through thy tender mercie: that in thy Sonne we may find righteousnes, euen remission of sinnes, reconciliation, and newnes of our mindes through the holie Spirit, whereby we may become heires of eternal life, being iustified by the grace of Christ, in whom we beleeue, which was offered for our sinnes.
For he taking our punishment vpon himselfe, did satisfie thy iustice fullie, and washed vs by his pretious blood from al our iniquities; and reconciled vs in the bodie of his flesh through death, to make vs holie, and blameles, and without fault in thy sight.
Make vs therfore strong in faith, and constant to resist al the ingins of Satan; and proceeding from faith to faith to attaine that righteousnes which is auaileable before thee by the redemption which is in Christ Iesu, whom thou hast appointed to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood, that iustified by his grace we may haue peace of conscience, and free accesse vnto the Father.
Holie, and merciful God, we humblie beseech thee, which hast raised in vs the sparkles of true faith, make perfect this good which thou hast begon in vs and bring it vntil the daie of our Lord Iesu Christ; wherby abounding more and more in knowledge and in al iudgement, we may allow the better, and be pure without offence vntil that daie, filled with the, fruite of righteousnes which are by Iesus Christ vnto the glorie, and praise of God.
Wherefore appoint thy strength, establish, God, which thou hast wrought in vs: that fighting a good fight we may retaine faith a good conscience, least vnder persecution and aduersities being tossed, we make shipwrack of our faith.
Helpe our weake and feeble faith, which is like the graine of mustard seede within vs that encreasing dailie more and more, it may take deepe roote, and remaine firme alwaies and immoueable: and neuer vanish awaie among so many sectes and diuisions in this worlde.
Extinguish al the doubtings of thy wil sticking in our corrupt nature; let vs not mistrust thy promises of eternal and temporal benefits, but applieng thy promises vnto our selues, alwaies giue credit vnto thy worde; and so depending wholie therevpon, contrarie to al sense of humane reason, we shal obteine a crowne of immortal glorie.
Grant likewise, heauenlie Father, that our faith be not barren, vaine, or dead without good workes, and fruites of the Spirit, but effectual working by charitie, that we may receiue the ende of our faith, euen the saluation of our soules; and behold thee, whome we now see by faith as it were in a glasse darklie in another world, looking vpon thy Maiestie face to face in Christ our Sauior, our Lord, and God, Amen.
MErciful, and gratious God, which hast called vs vnto thy kingdome and glorie; and of thy fatherlie and good pleasure enioined vs this care, that first and afore al things we should seeke thy Kingdome, and the righteousnes thereof: We beseech thee through, and for thy Sonne our Lorde, and Sauior Christ his sake, teach our weake minds; gouerne our wil and harts, that, without inuerting this thine appointed order, we may first seeke that thou maiest shine within vs; apprehende thy righteousnes by a true and liuelie faith, and be vnited vnto thee our eternal King.
Grant therefore that thy worde may be preached euerie where plainelie and purelie without fraud, and that we may cast downe al our imaginations, and euerie hie thing that is exalted against thy knowledge; and leade our vnderstanding captiue to the obedience of the worde which thou hast deliuered: and obey thy Gospel in al simplicitie of faith, according to the good plesure of thy wil to the praise of the glorie of thy grace.
Assist vs, our Father which art in heauen, that both thy word may be purely and sincerely preached, we thereby, as becometh the sonnes of God, reformed in our liues.
Giue vs thine holie Spirit, that we may beleeue thy word through thy grace, and so leade a godlie and virtuous life in this worlde, and liue hereafter with thy sonne in eternal blisse.
Breake thou of, and hinder al the consultations and deuises, both of the diuel, the worlde, and the flesh, which do neither sanctifie thine holie Name, nor suffer thy kingdome to be brought vnto vs. Comfort, and keepe vs stronglie in thy word, and faith, euen til our liues ende: that so both thy good and gratious wil may be done in our harts, and they which as yet beleeue not thy worde, by our good conuersation may be wonne to thy Gospel, and glorifie thee our God to the encrease of thy celestial kingdome.
Make vs meete to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light; Thou which hast deliuered vs from the power of darknes, translated vs into the kingdome of thy beloued sonne in whom we haue redemption through his blood, that is the remission of sinnes; that we may be grounded and stablished in faith, and not mooued awaie from the hope of the Gospel, but may walke vnblameable, and without fault in thy sight as it becommeth the children of light in al godlines and honestie.
And forasmuch as thy kingdome is not meate nor drinke, neither consisteth in ceremonies and traditions, which are inuented by man, neither commeth it with obseruations neither is it in word but in righteousnes and peace, and ioie in the holie Ghost, and in power: Grant, eternal God, that we, being borne anew by thy word and holie Spirit, may attaine the inheritance of eternal life; and lifting vp our harts on hie where Christ sitteth at thy right hande, may set our affections on things which are aboue, and not on things on the earth.
Therefore be thou present with vs in these latter daies of the world and begin thy kingdome in vs; prosper the same with thy diuine assistance, that we may be conformable vnto thy godlie pleasure, purchasing thy fauor in this world, and afterward in thy newe kingdome, in the kingdome of glorie, where thou God art al in al, may ioiefullie remaine with thee for euermore.
Grant therefore that we may be poore in spirit, in hart humble, sorowful in minde for our offences; and may with al our harts hunger and thirst after righteousnes: Make vs lowlie and courteous; liberal, and pittiful, pure in hart and peacemakers, likewise in persecutions and trobles patient, that we neither take nor giue offence vnto any; but may exercise our selues in the workes of charitie, and of mercie, feeding the hungrie giuing drinke to the thirstie, clothing the naked lodging strangers, comforting the weake, and visiting the imprisoned.
Finallie, of thine abundant mercie, grant, that in thy last iudgement we may heare that ioieful, and most co~fortable voice of thy welbeloued Sonne, saieng Come ye blessed of my Father, inherite the kingdome prepared for you from the foundations of the worlde, Amen.
OMost mightie GOD, King of al the world, which by thine holie Spirit hast commanded that supplications, praiers, intercessions, and giuing of thanks be made for al men: for Kings and for al that are in auctoritie, which thou hast placed to be rulers of the earth according to thy good wisedome, and set in gouernement at thy good pleasure.
For thou exaltest some vnto the top of honor and protectest their dignitie (thou castest not downe the mighty which art mighty thy selfe) and placest Kings in their throne.
We beseech thee therefore euen with deepe sighs of hart, Lord of Lordes, that forgiuing our sinnes thou woldest giue good Rulers; and also maintaine their auctoritie.
For among men there is no place for Lawe and iustice, where the rulers and princes whom thou hast appointed are not feared.
Vphold al the states, and gouernors of this realme; and protect them from destruction in these greuous calamities, and miserable disorder of these latter daies.
Especiallie preserue our Noble Queene, and hir godlie Counsaile: grant them a long, healthful, good life; that they may deuoutlie serue thee, and iustlie doe their office.
Lighten their minds with the knowledge of thy sacred word, that they may deale wisely and be learned which iudge the earth; seruing thee in feare, and reioicing in trembling.
Let them embrace discipline and kisse the Sonne the Sauior of the world: least happilie he be angrie, and they perish in the waie.
Blesse them, God, that they may alwaies hope in thee, nourish thy ministers, giue reliefe vnto thy Gospel; and open their gates that the King of glorie may come in, the Lord of power, which is mightie in battel.
Giue them a care of godlines, that they may giue their goods to the erecting cherishing of the church; and shew themselues Patrones and defenders of the same.
Make them diligent in rooting out superstition, and in promoting thy Kingdome; in maintaining the puritie of doctrine; in remoouing al offences; and finallie in wyping awaie al filthines which both defile thy religion, and deface thy glory: that the commers after vs haue none occasion of transgressing.
Blesse them with sober counsaile, wisedome, industrie and courage of minde.
Giue them good successe in al their enterprises, prosper their doings.
Let them consider that they are placed to defend the good and innocent; and with seuere punishment to correct the wicked and rebellious: so shal wickednes be taken from among vs, and the publike state remaine in safetie, to the preseruation of mankind, and continuance both of common Christian peace to the glorie of thy sacred Maiestie, and the commoditie of their subiects; to the rooting out of ignorance and error; and to the furtherance of good artes, honest trades, and liberal studies.
And forasmuch as the harts of Kings, Queenes, and of al men are in thine handes, so that thou canst turne them at thy pleasure, we beseech thee, almightie and merciful God, that it would please thee to turne from crueltie to clemencie the minds of al Tyrans and vnmerciful Princes, that they mooue not war against thee rashlie, wherby the course of thy diuine worde may be hindered; worldlie substance wickedlie consumed; and their subiects polled vnreasonably deuoured: But giue vnto al in auctoritie quiet harts, desirous of christian concord, that they may remember they are the ministers of God to maintaine his glorie, to keepe their people from iniurie and oppression; and beare the sword to take vengance on them which doe euil on the behalfe of God.
For they rule not for their owne cause, but for the publike welfare; neither may they doe what they list, but are bound to seeke the profit of their subiectes, and to set forth the glorie of God.
Let them not therefore abuse their auctoritie power: but grant them grace to remember continuallie that they are mortal men, whose Lord is in heauen, which respecteth no person and afore whose iudgment seat they must al appeare, and giue an account vnto thee the true and righteous God, iudge both of the quicke and dead, which raignest and rulest for euermore, Amen.
Most merciful God, at thy beck do al things bow, both in heauen, and in earth; at thy voice doe both wind and seas obey, confessing thy Maiestie.
Euerie knee boweth vnto thee both of things in heauen, things in earth, things vnder the earth: meete it is also that we obeie thee, which hast commanded al Subiects to giue due obedience and reuerence vnto their lawful Magistrates, which subiection thou hast inioined vnto vs not onelie to auoide punishment, but especiallie to keepe and reteine a good conscience.
For al auctoritie is ordained by thee that the world euerie where may be godlie and quietlie gouerned.
For much more safelie doe we liue vnder lawes and iudgement, than if euerie man had the bridle at wil to roaue as he list.
We beseech thee therefore, eternal God, that first of al in euerie thing, and in al things, we may obey thee our most high and mightie God, King of the whole world before any creature, and that in true faith, and godlie feare.
Next that al Subiects, and priuate persons with al singlenes of hart, in al thinges, which are not contrarie to thy worde, may obeie their publike Magistrate hauing power auctoritie ouer them; and submit themselues to euerie ciuil ordinance, for thy sake, not to the King onelie as to the chiefe, but to other inferior officers sent from him, for the punishment of euil doers, and for the praise of the good.
Let them alwaies remember that this subiection and obedience thou requirest to be showen as to thine owne ordinance, whereby the safetie of mankind is maintained.
Wherefore bend thou our harts, and guide them, that we enuie not the honor due to our Superiors; neither obraie, nor backbyte them, but rather, honoring them most dutifullie, may both praie for them, and paie with willing mindes whatsoeuer by the ciuil law, and by nature we are bound to doe.
Be it far from vs, Almightie God, that any of vs should despise, raile or in his hart wish euil vnto his Prince, or Superiors.
For thou hast vouchsafed them the title of Gods in the holie Scriptures: because they rule in thy steed here on the earth.
Hence it is, that whosoeuer resist their Superiors and forsake the yoke of obedience, are said to resist thine ordinance, and shal receiue to themselues iudgement, running into the foule crime of treson against thy sacred person; and staining their conscience with the filthie spot of obstinacie and disobedience, giuing an occasion vnto the wicked to slander thy Gospel.
Grant also that inferiors, subiects be not burdened with ouer great new exactions, vnlawful paiments, and intollerable tributes, neither oppressed with greeuous seruitude, or pilled by any other violence, or tyrannie.
And if in any place Lions and woolues shew their crueltie toward thy seruants, their godlie Subiects, plucking their skinnes from them, breaking their bones, and deuouring thy people none otherwise than if they shoulde eate bread giue patience vnto thine afflicted members, that they may quietlie susteine their miserable seruitude, as a crosse sent from thee for a trial of their faith and patience.
Aide vs with thy comfort, whereby we may with patient minds suffer the trobles which in this last and doting age of this world more and more encrease; remembring that thou God, hast prepared thy throne in iudgement to iudge the worlde in equitie, and thy people with righteousnes; to be a refuge for the poore, and an helper in due time, euen in affliction.
For the poore shal not alwaie be forgotten: the hope of the afflicted shal not perish for euer.
Wherefore listen thou vnto the praier and sighes of thy seruants which crie vnto thee, aide them, as thou didst the children of Israël, whose miserie, calamitie, and bondage thou didst behold, deliuering them fro~ the greeuous seruitude of Egypt; and bringing them out of the yron fornace of Pharao, through thy mighty and stretched out arme.
Keepe vs also from vngodlie and idolatrous Magistrates, that we be not vnder the yoke, and gouernement of Infidels Ethnikes, which wil be vnto vs and our posteritie in steede of thornes and prickes offering continual occasions of Apostasie, reuolting from true religion.
Suffer not the rod of the wicked to rest vpon the lot of the righteous, least the righteous put forth their hand vnto wickednes.
Breake in peeces the scepters of the wicked: and deliuer vs from the yoake of sinne, that wee offer not our members as instruments of vnrighteousnes, and that wickednes rage not in our mortal bodies to the suppressing of the soule and bodie, which liuest and raignest in al eternitie, Amen.
God most hie, whose dwelling is aboue the cloudes, and rulest al things both in heauen and earth; Why do garde the workes of thine handes: therefore destroie and ouerthrowe them, so that they neuer be able to arise againe.
God of Sabbaoth, fight thou against them that fight against vs; laie hand vpon thy shield and buckler, stand vp for our helpe; bring out also the speare, and encounter with them which persecute vs, that we may knowe thy saluation on the earth.
Giue the victorie ouer thine enimies vnto our Magistrates, capitaines, and conductors of thy people.
Blessed be the Lorde our strength which teacheth the hands of our soldiors to fight; and their fingers to war.
For thou art our aide, and the defence in whom we trust; thou destroiest al our enimies.
For the victorie commeth from heauen, and is not gotten by the multitude of an host.
The King is not saued by the multitude of warriers; neither is the mightie man deliuered by his great strength.
An horse is a vaine thing; and shal not deliuer anie by his mightie bones.
Thou canst aswel saue by a fewe as by manie.
Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord and his blessing is vpon the people.
Wherefore breake thou the arme of the vngodlie; weaken their strength; bring al their counsailes to naught; destroie them which trust in their multitudes and in their chariots, in their speares, shields, and arrowes.
For thou art our God which breakest the battels; the Lorde is thy Name.
Lift vp thine arme as thou didst in the beginning, breake their strength with thy power.
Ouerthrowe their force in thy displeasure, which vowe to violate thy sanctuarie, and to pollute the Tabernacle of thy most glorious Name.
Grant Lord that with their owne sword their pride may be cut of.
Let them al be confounded which hate thee; let the~ be broght to shame which deale wickedlie.
Let them be as chaffe before the wind, and let thine Angel scatter them.
Let the enimies of thy Chuch blush and be trobled greatlie; let them be turned back and brought to speedie confusion, that thy Name be not blasphemed among the Gentiles, Amen.
ALMIGHTIE, and merciful God, thou hast made the Moone for certaine seasons the Sunne, which thou hast created, knoweth his going downe; Thou makest darknes, and it is night, wherin men betake them to rest, cease from their worke, and recreate their wearied members through sleepe.
Therefore in the euening we wil praise thee, and going to bed wil giue thee thanks, because thou hast kept vs this daie of thine onelie mercie without any merit of ours from al danger and hurt.
When we are in troble we cal vpon thee, and in the euening wil we remember thy mercie and truth, which thou hast shewed vnto vs abundantlie.
Our eies preuent the night watches to meditate vpon thy wonderful things; and our studies shal be alwaies of the excellencie of thy Name.
For thou hast sent from heauen and deliuered vs; and hast brought them to shame that troade vpon vs. God, thou hast sent thy mercie and truth, and taken our soules from the mids of them which compassed vs about.
Therefore we wil sacrifice freelie vnto thee, and praise thy most glorious Name.
For thou hast deliuered vs from al troble, and our eies haue seene our desire vpon our enimies.
Lorde, God of our saluation daie and night doe we crie before thee; when our eies are trobled through griefe and bitternes of our soules, we poure out our teares before thee, and in this place we humblie beseech thee, couer and put out al our offences; that as the Sunne of this daie is now downe and hidden: so thou woldest also hide al our iniquities, and drowne al our offences in the bottom of the sea, that they neuer be seene with eies, nor come forth into iudgement.
our God, we blush, and are ashamed to lift vp our eies vnto thee.
For we are not worthie to lift vp our eies vnto Heauen, because our sinnes are mo than the heares of our head.
Our offences haue taken such hold on vs that we are vnable to looke vp.
We haue sinned, Lord, we haue sinned and haue committed iniquitie, yea, we haue rebelled, and departed from thy precepts, from thy iudgements; We haue not obeied thy seruants which spake in thy Name to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fathers, and to al the people of the lande.
Lord, righteousnes belongeth vnto thee; but vnto vs open shame and confusion.
Lord thou art iust, and al thy works, and al thy waies are mercie and truth; thou iudgest truelie and rightlie for euer.
Remember vs, and looke vpon vs according to the multitude of thy mercies, neither punish vs for our sinnes, nor remember our offences, nor our forefathers, which haue not obeied thy commandements.
We faint in our mourning, we wil cause our bed to swim, and water our coutch with teares.
Our eies be trobled through the griefe of our wickednes, and our faces be withered.
Lord, God of hosts, heare our praier; God our protector behold and looke vpon the face of Christ thine onelie begotten Sonne making intercession for vs, and winke at our offences.
Hide thy face from our sinnes blot out al our iniquities.
Create in vs cleane harts, God, and renue right spirits within vs. Cast vs not away from thy presence, take not thine holie spirit fro~ vs. Restore to vs the ioie of thy saluation and stablish vs with thy free Spirit, that we may doe al things according to thy wil, and serue thee alwaies with a willing minde.
Christ King of glorie, we beseech thee blessed Lorde, defend vs this night; let our rest be in thee, graunt vs thy grace that neither much sleepe ouerwhelme vs, nor Satan inuade vs; nor the flesh betraie vs vnto him and make vs giltie in thy sight.
Let our eies sleepe, but let our harts wake, cause thy right hand to protect such as trust in thee.
Lord, lighten our eies that we slepe not in death, that Satan hurt vs not, and our enimie saie, haue preuailed against them.
Watch ouer vs, eternal Sauior, least the subtil tempter ouertake vs, and we sleepe a perpetual sleepe and wake no more.
Keepe vs as the apple of thine eie, hide vs vnder the shadowe of thy wings, Lorde, that neither ouglie visions, nor horrible dreames, nor sightes and monsterous apparitions troble vs in the darke.
In thy Name, sweete Iesu, wil we go to bed, and giue sleepe to our eies, and slomber to our eie lids, compasse vs about, and raise vs againe to the ioieful sight of tomorrow light; and after this miserable life bring vs to the beholding of eternal happines, that in thy light we may see light, and euermore praise thee raigning worlds without ende, Amen.
Almightie, euerliuing, true, merciful God, eternal Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, which together with thy Sonne and the holie Ghost hast created the frame of this worlde withal things therin conteined, and preseruest the same as yet according to thy free pleasure: al creatures without ceassing euermore should extol and praise thee, that doe euen the very fowles of the aire which earelie in the morning among the thick branches of trees, and from the mids of rocks, giuing out their sound and flieng about in the aire with most pleasant tunes doe magnifie thee the eternal God, Lord, and Creator of al things.
And therfore we men also earelie in the morning shold praise thee for thy benefits, and euermore extol thy mercie with diuine commendations.
Thou hast preserued vs this night passed, and from our cradles to this present houre hast thou kept vs safe.
Thou hast caused vs to come from sleepe and darkenes vnto the light of this daie: and from our beds through thy benignitie we doe arise in safetie.
Hadst not thou, Lorde, bin present with vs, and watched vs, the insatiable crueltie of Satan had deuoured vs. Hadst not thou kept our houses and vs the keeper of the Citie had watched in vaine.
If the Lorde had not bin on our side when men rose vp against vs, they had then swallowed vs vp quicke, when their wrath was kindled against vs: then had the waters (of troble) drowned vs, and the streame (of miseries) had gone ouer our soules; yea the swelling merciles waters had gone ouer our soules.
Blessed be the Lorde which hath not giuen vs a praie for their teeth.
Our soules are escaped, euen as a bird out of the snare of the foulers, the snare is broken, and we are deliuered.
Our helpe is in the Name of the Lorde which hath made both heauen and earth.
Now harken therefore vnto our words, Lorde, marke our crie, vnderstand the voice of our praier, our King and our God.
For vnto thee, Lorde we wil praie, heare our voice in the morning.
Earelie wil we stand before thee, and behold thy fortitude and Maiestie, looking for thine assistance with a woonderful desire.
God and gouernor, raise vs vp earelie earelie we saie lit vp our eares to the hearing of thee our instructor.
Open thou our eares that we rebel not against thee, neither yet go backwarde; but let thy voice sound in our eares: make them obedient vnto thee that we be not obstinate like the serpent, neither hardened like the deafe adder which stoppeth his eares: but let them be open to heare thy Lawes and testimonies: and harken alwaies vnto the crie of the poore that the morning light may rise vnto vs, and our light breake foorth as the daie, and our health spring vp sodeinlie.
Againe, shut vp our eares, hedge them in with thornes, and put bars vpon them, that they neither admit nor allowe false doctrine, and that they turne not from the truth to fables, and other follies.
But thou, our God and Creator, which didst plant the eare hearest al things, make the same with a willing and readie minde to obeie thee our maker and Redeemer.
Heare vs, Lorde, for thy louing kindnes is good turne vnto vs according to the multitude of thy tender mercies: stop not thine eare from our sighing and from our crie.
Incline thine eare Lord, and heare vs, for we are poore and needie.
Haue mercie on vs, Lord, because we crie vnto thee al the daie long.
Let vs heare thy louing kindnes in the morning, which is better than al riches, yea, than life it selfe; make vs to heare ioie and gladnes, that the bones which thou hast broken may reioice.
We beseech thee, eternal God, by the incarnation and natiuitie of thy Sonne Iesu Christ, that through thy worde entering into our eares, and mindes, thou wilt transforme vs into new men, and be borne of thee, and as new borne babes may desire that milke not of bodie, but of the minde which knowes no deceipt: whereby we may growe, and taste how sweete thy promise is vnto the godlie; which embrace the same through faith: and that laieng aside al malitiousnes, and guile, and al dissimulation and enuie, we may walke as children, but in vnderstanding, may be perfect.
And being thus regenerated, kepe vs, eternal God, both this day and at al times from euil tydings that our eares heare no rumors of wars, nor be terrefied by any greeuous chance.
Fil vs in this houre with thy fauor, that al this daie reioicing together, we may delight in thy praises, through our Lord Iesus Christ which liueth and raigneth with thee for euermore, Amen.
God the holie Ghost which proceedest from the Father and the Sonne, and with them art worshipped and glorified in the vnitie of the true and eternal Deitie, and art also the substantial amitie betweene the Father and the Sonne: We worship thee, we praise and glorifie thee, and with our whole hart we thanke thee for al thy benefits: especiallie for calling vs by the voice of the Gospel vnto the Christian congregation; for illuminating vs with thy gifts; for sanctifieng vs with a stedfast faith, and for keeping vs hetherto in the same.
For by the font of the wholesome lauor, that is, by the water of holie baptisme, being poured into vs, thou dost continuallie worke in vs regeneration and renuing of the inwarde man.
Harken we beseech thee, vnto our supplication, teach vs miserable men, which by the proper strength of our only reason ca~ by no meanes trust in, or approch to Christ our Lorde and Sauiour, teach vs, our God, what thy pleasure is, and leade vs into al truth.
For without thine assistance none can saie that Iesus is the Lord.
blessed light, fil the inwarde partes of thy faithful; without thy grace nothing is within man, which is not hurtful.
Wash that is filthie; water that is drie; heale that is wounded; bow the obstinate; cherish the frozen; and reclame them which wander.
Giue to thy faithful trusting in thee, the reward of wel doing; the entrance into happines, and euerlasting comfort.
Thou in thy giftes seuenfold, which art the Spirit of the Lord, the spirit of wisdome vnderstanding, the spirit of counsel strength; the spirit of knowledge, and of the feare of the Lord: inspire into vs through the preaching of the Gospel, thine heauenlie wisedome about thine essence and diuine pleasure, which is hid from the world.
Grant that we may know the Father and the Sonne by thee, and may alwaies beleeue that thou art the spirit of them both: and so worship one God in trinitie, and the trinitie in vnitie: whose wil is, that not one should perish but be conuerted and liue; and that as many as beleeue in the Sonne should haue euerlasting life.
For the Father sent the Sonne not to condemne the worlde: but that the worlde through him might be saued.
Lightener of the minde, poure vpon vs thy new light, and purge the horrible darknes of our minds, so that we may see and knowe our chiefe Father, whom pure eies onlie doe behold.
thou heauenlie comforter giue vnto vs a testimonie; grant vnto our minds a token of the certaintie of our beliefe, so that wee doubt not, neither wauer about thy diuine goodnes toward vs. Make our harts quiet and secure, that with a ful trust and confidence we may approch to the throne of thine heauenlie grace, receiuing by adoption the right of children; and inflamed with spiritual ioie in al boldnes and libertie may crie, Abba Father.
Thou which art the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the promise, and art effectual by thy worde and Sacraments; signe our harts with the seale of thy promise, whereby we may haue the same, and retaine it surelie in our harts, through thy deede.
Thou most faithful Aduocate strengthen vs against al the assaults and tentations of Satan: so that we may neuer doubt of thy diuine prouidence and predestination, whereby we are chosen and called in Christ vnto euerlasting life, and neuer, being stroken with a seruile feare, and oppressed with dreadful doubtings, may in a rage flie and forsake our God.
surpassing comforter, leaue vs not destitute of thine aide, and patronage, but vouchsafe euermore to be present with vs in our crosses and trobles; least otherwise we faint.
But rather make vs to reioice in tribulations, knowing that a crowne of life is laide vp for such as loue him.
thou teacher of men instruct vs how, and what we ought to praie for according to thy wil, that we may be heard and make thou intercession for vs, with sighes that cannot be expressed.
thou clenser of the hart, giue vnto vs the simplicitie of minde without gal and bitternes, which descendedst in Iordan vpon our Lorde and Sauior Christ in the likenes of a doue that we may be void of bitter enuie, and contention in our harts; and haue no roote among vs, that bringeth forth gal and wormewood.
thou substantial flame proceeding from the brest of the Father and his eternal Sonne, lighten our harts with the fire of chaste burning loue: thou which apperedst at the feast of Pentecost vnto the Apostles in clouen tongues like fire; see vnto our coldnes, and comfort vs with thy quickening heate and breathings, that we may receiue thy chrisme and annointment.
thou ghest of the soule, make thee a mansion place within the secret parts of our harts; that we may be an house for thy diuinitie which may dwel perpetuallie in our members, and neuer depart from vs, through our Lorde and Sauior Christ, Amen.
BLessed be God euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ which according to his abundant mercie hath begotten vs againe vnto a liuelie hope by the resurrection of his Sonne from the dead to an inheritance immortal, and vndefiled, and that vadeth not away, reserued in heauen for such as beleeue on him, through the confession of the truth, which is according to godlines vnder the hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, hath promised, before the world began.
For how can a man hope for that which he seeth? But if we hope for that we see not, we doe with patience abide for it.
For such is the wil of almightie God, that we shal not haue saluation as long as we are here in this world, but onelie in hope, nourishing the same as it were clasped in our armes: but then we shal perceiue the same in deede, when we depart from hence one daie.
For how can that be hoped for, which is not beleeued? And this hope depending vpon the promise of God is so certaine, as if the thing it selfe were present.
For God which hath promised to vs saluation, is truth and can neither deceaue, nor be deceaued.
Wherefore we beseech thee, eternal Father, autor of hope and comfort, fil vs with al ioie and peace in beleeuing, that we may abounde in hope, through the power of the holie Ghost, and aboue hope in hope beleeuing may neuer doubt of thy promises, but in a sure confidence of hart applie to our selues the remission of sinnes, and verilie beleue that we please thee through Christ, looking in a certaine and strong hope, through sufferance for the saluation of our soules in the life to come.
And albeit the helpes of our happines appeare not in this world, yet let vs retaine a stedfast hope amo~g al the terrors and feares of conscience; and neuer suffer the same to be taken from vs by any snares of Satan: but expecting that blessed appearing of the glorie of the mightie God, and of our Sauior Christ, which hath giuen himselfe for vs, alwaies fasten the same vpon the good things absent and to come.
thou onelie begotten Sonne of God which hast loued vs and giuen vs euerlasting comfort hope through grace, comfort our harts, establish vs in euery word and good worke; that we stick not vncertaine, neither be tossed betweene hope feare, but may hold fast the confidence.
gedst thy selfe downe from the hiest top of glorie to vtter shame, putting on our flesh, thy Maiestie being hid and dissembled for a time.
And so becamest thou obedient vnto thy Father not onelie in obeieng him with greater reuerence than anie other creature else did: but also in offering vp thy selfe a sacrifice for sinnes, thereby to redeeme vs being bondslaues through pride vnto sin and death, to exalt vs to an hope of eternal life; and withal by thine example to teach vs, and to propose an example of true lowlines, and humilitie, saieng Learne of me, for am meeke, and lowlie in hart: We beseech thee through thine humilitie and passion, giue vnto vs a contrite spirit, a contrite and an humbled hart, which thou despisest not, Lord.
For thou art neere vnto al them which are of a trobled hart, and wilt saue such as are humble in spirit.
Thou regardest their praiers, giuest to them thy grace, and thy secrets are reuealed vnto the lowlie.
Grant therfore that we following thy footesteps may humble our selues from the hart without hypocrisie.
Turne our harts that they be not wickedlie humbled, after the maner of hypocrites, which bow themselues, and are sad casting downe their faces towards the earth, whose inward parts notwithstanding are ful of deceit.
God, holie Ghost, which art the ruler of our mindes, and the giuer of good gifts; which not onelie commendest, but also commandest vs to haue benignitie lowlines, modestie, and patience that being clothed therewithal we may endeuour to facion our selues after thee, thinking modestlie and soberlie of our selues: Gouerne thou our minds, that we may be subiect one to another, not onelie honoring, but also preuenting one another in dooing the same; and alwaies applieng our selues to humilitie, may seeke thy glorie, and the profit of our neighbor.
Let neither pride nor luxuriousnes haue dominion either in our sence or speech; neither let vs lift vp our pecocks feathers, nor extol our eielids through arrogancie; neither glorie in proude and vaine opinions but by humblenes of minde, submitting our selues one to another, may thinke others better than our selues, and consider what our condition is.
For man taken from the earth must returne vnto the same, and be the heire of wormes and serpents.
Especiallie our request is, that we be not puffed vp in spiritual gifts: remooue arrogancie pride from vs, that our harts be not lifted vp, nor yet our eies exalted; neither let vs wade in greater higher things than becommeth vs; cause vs to frame and tame our minds like a child newlie weaned, which is lowly with his mother.
Let our minds be weaned like a childe knowing not what pride meanes.
Keepe the prowde diuel that he prouoke vs not to sinne, nor to swel vp through a vaine perswasion of fleshlie righteousnes, neither wickedlie to boast of thy gifts, abusing them to our owne glorie, and contempt of others.
Suffer vs not to seeme wise in our owne eies.
Amende this vice ingraffed in vs by nature, that no man loue or like himselfe too wel; and in respect of himself contemne others, hauing not the like, or not so excellent gift as he hath.
Suffer not good wits, teachers armed with publike auctoritie to be pricked and tickled with the spurs of pride curiositie to the moouing of idle questions, and disputations, either through ambition or hatred.
For that is not the wisedome descending from aboue: but earthlie, sensual, and diuelish.
For where emulation and strife is, there is sedition and al manner of euil works.
Grant therefore that al of vs being humble may be exalted to eternal life, Amen.
Most holie God, and mercisul father, which of thy singular prouidence, and woonderful wisedome diddest ordaine matrimonie in Paradyse and that in the time of innocencie, for the multiplieng and conseruation of mankinde: thereby to gather vnto thy selfe continuallie out of godlie families, an holie catholike church which may rightly acknowledge, serue, and celebrate thine holie name for euermore, and deliuer the true vnderstanding of thee vnto posterities by one generation to another.
This thine institution did thy Sonne, God coequal with thee and coeternal, confirme and adorne in Cana of Galile by turning water into good wine.
notable honoring of mariage doubtles for Christ not onlie to be present himselfe at the nuptial feast, but also to set out the same with the first myracle that he wrought after his natiuitie.
Likewise thy holie Spirit doth witnes by the worde deliuered vnto vs, and saith, that mariage is honorable among al.
And the same thy Spirit reioiceth in three things which are commended both before God and man, in the concorde of brethren, in the loue of neighbors, and in a man and wife that agree wel together For such as be at variance can neither cal vpon thee as they should, nor please thee as they ought.
eternal God it is sufficientlie apparent, with what a rage and insatiable hatred, Satan, the most deadlie enimie to al thy works, doth labour and set himselfe to the breaking of, and ouerthrow of this thy sacred ordinance.
Wherefore, we beseech thee, impart thy fauor vnto al maried folks, that they may acknowledge thee to be the autor and institutor of this knitting together in wedlock; and knowe and beleeue stedfastlie that they are in a good estate, wherein they may please thee through christ thy Sonne.
For hauing this comfort they wil more willinglie and cheerefully discharge the duties of their calling in true confidence, and calling vpon thy Name.
But such as doubt of their kinde of life, hauing their conscience wounded, trobled minds, can neither cal vpon thee truelie, nor cheerefullie go about, and finish their affaires.
Grant therefore vnto al and euerie married bodie, that in true faith and confession they may retaine the indissoluble chaine of wedded state, and the strong bonds of godly fellowship: that they may loue one another, and in the sweate of their browes eate their bread; and bring vp their children in al godlines, through instruction, and information of the Lorde, and neuer feare the crosse which accompanieth this kinde of life.
Worke so that Satan by no meanes weaken and ouerthrowe this thine ordinance; nor that married folkes, wearied with the trobles of wedded life, raise mortal hatred among themselues, and so detest and abhor this thine holie institution, seeke vnlawful diuorcements.
For by this engine of incredulitie, and snare of mistrust being comprehended, they wil easilie rush headlong into enormous offences by casting of the yoke of the Lorde, and be carried through dissention into horrible co~fusions of concupiscence, to adulterie, whoredome, wicked forsakings, so long, til polluted with filthie spots, and defiled with most horrible staines they bring themselues hedlong into euerlasting torments.
Grant therefore, most merciful God, that al at debate may come to amitie, and be reconciled in thy Name, and, being mindful of the knot of mariage, and mutual bond betweene them, may dwel and liue peaceablie together in true faith, and feare of thy Name: That husbands abusing their auctoritie, doe not exercise tyrannie ouer their wiues, but rather loue them, and dwel with them according to knowledge giuing honor vnto them as vnto the weaker vessels, euen as to them which are also heires of grace and life: Likewise that matrones contemne not their husbands, denieng subiection, but rather studie by chaste obedience, and holie conuersation and lowlines to ouercome them.
Let neither hate other extremelie, and so violate the state of mariage, and bring themselues out of thy fauor, through their discorde and contention, wherby their praiers be interrupted.
For where neither part doe their dutie, there must needes ensue first pouertie, subtiltie, lieng, and al impietie: afterward a wounded conscience; and last of al vtter despaire.
most chaste God, which didst therefore institute the order of matrimonie, that by the same both the weake nature of mankinde might liue purelie in lawful wedlock, and an holie Church be gathered vnto thy selfe: giue thy blessing to al which are married, that they may haue godlie children, their wiues proue like the fruiteful vine, and their children appere like the oliue branches round about their table, and may see their childers children, the peace safetie of the Church, the which, Christ thy Sonne repairer of mankind by taking our flesh vpon him, hath copled to himselfe, which liueth and raigneth with thee in the vnitie of the holie Spirit a God for euermore, Amen.
OMost merciful God, and eternal Father, which out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast ordained strength of thy praise; and wilt also that yong men and maidens, old men and children should praise thee the eternal God, in true confessing, inuocating, and celebrating of thy diuine maiestie through al generations for euermore: Thou hast enioined vnto children that they shewe due honor, subiection, and reuerence to their parents, and obeie them willinglie in al good and lawful things: We beseech thee, on the behalfe of al infants, children, and yonger sort, as wel maidens, as of the malekind, implant in them a true fear thy Name, that from their youth they may confesse thee to be the onelie true God, and Iesus whom thou hast sent to be Christ; and encrease daily in this wholeso~e knowledge, profiting as in yeeres so in fauor both before thee and men.
Let them not cast of the yoake of obedience and subiection, neither yet abuse the gentlenes of their parents and elders vnto libertie of sinning, nor by their hardnes and austeritie conceaue an hatred against them, and refuse their correction: but make them pacientlie to take the warnings and discipline of their parents in good part, to the glorie of thy Name, and saluation of their owne soules.
Christ, louer of mankind, which co~mandest children to be brought vnto thee, and receiuing them into thine armes, in token of a singular and deere good wil, laieng thine hands vpon them didst blesse them: We beseech thee, which for our sakes wast borne an infant, and didst shed thy most innocent blood vpon the altar of the crosse, aswel for infants as for elder folkes; blesse thou al infants, and children; impart thy grace vpon them, that they may feare thee, and haue their parents in great reuerence, according to thy wil, which is a most certaine rule of al iustice and vprightnes.
Keepe them therefore that they be not infected with false doctrine, and superstitious seruice; neither yet seduced from true religion through wicked and vngodlie behauior.
Preserue them from wicked companie, and filthie felowship, which as contagion and leauen ouercometh and pearceth the whole lumpe; keepe them from riotousnes dronkennes; from wandring concupiscence; from idlenes, which ministreth matter and nourishment vnto al vices.
Remooue awaie al shameful examples, and take awaie al offences that the yonger sort beholding the multitude of sinners, follow not the steps of the wicked, and without feare enter into their most abhominable waies.
Giue vnto al yong scholers a good wit to conceiue, a good capacitie to vnderstand, and a good memorie to beare awaie good lessons, and to learne from their infancie those things, which may instruct them to saluatio~ by faith which is in Christ Iesus.
For euerie scripture giuen by the inspiration of God, is profitable to teach, to reproue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnes that the man of God may be absolute being instructed to al good works.
The entrance into thy words giueth light to the blinde, and vnderstanding to the simple.
Grant therefore that from their youth they may exercise themselues in thy commandements.
For the first institution doth much good, yea, the whole race of their life afterward dependeth vpon the same.
God the holie Ghost, which workest by thy worde and sacraments, and thereby gatherest vnto thy selfe a Church, not onelie from the elder sort, but also from the yonger, wee beseech thee maintaine scholes and scholers, which are the seede of thy Church, and direct their studies vnto the honor of thy glorious Name.
Turne the harts of youth to the loue of true doctrine and virtue: wherby they may come to good behauior in manners, and to sounde learning of minde.
Maintaine the scholes wherin the tongues and sciences are taught, which thou hast reuealed vnto mankinde as necessarie helpes to teach withal; that so the pure sound of thine heauenlie doctrine may be heard and retained in the true and right Congregation.
And forasmuch as the verie cogitations of mans hart are euil euen from his youth; and our nature, through the fal of our first parents euen fro~ our yong yeares is corrupted, and prone to al wickednes, that easily it ca~not be brought vnder the subiection of another.
For foolishnes is bound in the hart of a childe: Giue them wisedome and learning, that they doe not delight in wicked affections, and so grow on in malice and stubbornes, waxing wild and resisting godlie and honest admonitions, and that, being become vnbridled, sauage, vntrectable, and past learning, they proue not obstinate in wickednes disobedience; but make them through thine instinct to learne and embrace thy commandements, and to binde thy law continually about their harts, and tie it about their necks, that thy grace gift may encrease by grace, vntil, growing to mans estate, they become profitable instruments of thy Church, and teachers of righteousnes, and abide conioined vnto thee, which liuest and raignest a God worlds without ende, Amen.
Lord IESV Christ, Sonne of the almightie God: great is the rage and tyrannie of the Diuel, which being strong and armed keepeth his court to possesse the same in peace, and to augment his kingdome of darkenes, wherein reigneth horrible Idolatrie, hatred of thy truth, diuers abhominable worshipings, with al kinde of shameful transgressions, most outragious wickednes.
Lamentable also is the wretched blindnes, and obstinate malice of those men, which suffer themselues to be ruled by Satan, and follow the beast vnto al kind of impietie.
In whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes of Infidels, that the light of thy glorious Gospel, which is the image of God, should not shine in them.
But are held captiue at the Diuels pleasure, whose harts he doth possesse, and is mightie in the children of darkenes, so that subduing the natural powers, hee carrieth them into horrible wickednes; which indeede, after such a beastlie rage, and so furiouslie woulde not rush into al filthie and vile wickednes, were they not driuen therevnto through the force of Satan, which carrieth them hether thether as he list like bondslaues, vntil at length they fal vnto blaspheming of thy most holie Name: so that conuicted of their owne conscience they impugne, and mortallie pursue thy word of purpose committing therby the sinne against the holie Ghost.
For when wittinglie and of purpose they denie the manifest and knowen truth of God through obstinate malice and voluntarie stubbornes, and persist impenitent, they become blasphemers of God.
Because wittinglie and maliciouslie, euen against their conscience, they cal good, euil, and euil they affirme to be good, putting light for darknes, and darknes for light.
There is none hope of the forgiuenes of this sinne.
Such sacriledge is not forgiuen neither in this world nor in the world to come.
Because they conuert the onelie remedie of saluation into deadlie poison, and with an affected ignorance they continue in manifest impietie against their conscience.
And therefore they cannotlaie the fault of their wickednes vpon others: because not against, but with their wils they prostitute themselues before the Diuel, and obeie the Prince of darknes with al redines of minde; and studie without repentance to drawe others vnto euerlasting perdition by the example of their wicked life.
Christ, King of glorie, which art stronger than the Diuel, and hast spoiled him of al his armor wherin he trusted.
Thou hast brused in peeces that monstrous Leuiathan of an huge woonderful bignes; and brought vnder feete the mightie strong Goliath which obraided thine host: We beseech thee, shewe forth thy power and bring the Diuel vnder our feete destroie his kingdome, that we runne not into the sinne of blasphemie, neither go about to extinguish in our selues the light of the holie Ghost, nor kick against the same.
thou mightie Gigant, which hast cast headlong into hel the very Angels which sinned bound with the chaines of darknes, so to take from them al power, that they rule not ouer the faithful, and holy ones: take vs out of the floud of heresies, and prophane opinions: and suffer vs not to be drowned in the lake burning with fire and brimstone.
Christ the leader vnto life, which dieng diddest destroie our death, and by rising againe repaire our life: take vs vnto thee, that being ingraffed, and vnited to thy body we may be neuer separated from thee our head.
And quicken vs being once dead through sin, wherin we walked according to the custome of this world, after him which is Prince of the aire, and worketh in these daies within the children of vnbeleefe, among whom we our selues also walked sometime in the concupiscence of our flesh, doing those things which delighted our sences and fantasies.
For by nature we were the sonnes of wrath, euen as others.
But now thou, God, which art rich in mercie, for thy great kindnes sake wherewith thou louest vs: gouerne vs by thine holie Spirit, that we neuer forsake the faith which thou hast giuen vs, but perseuering in the rase begunne, may attaine through thy grace to the saluation of our soules.
Take awaie from vs that which is deformed by our corrupt nature, continue that which thy grace hath wrought within vs, that sin raigne not in our mortal bodies, neither we obeie it in the vnlawful lustes therof.
Assist vs with thine aide that being deliuered from sinne we may be the seruants of righteousnes, and obeie that doctrine from the hart wherevnto we are brought, giuing our members, seruants of righteousnes vnto sanctification: so shal we serue thee our true GOD here in the kingdome of grace, herafter in the kingdome of glorie, which liuest with God the Father and the holie Ghost for euermore, Amen.
BLessed GOD, and Father of our Lord Iesu christ, of thine abundant, great mercie hast thou preserued vs miserable men this daie from the crueltie and tyrannie of Satan, and from sondrie perils and calamities.
Thou hast shewed vs great trobles in our life: notwithstanding thou returnedst and diddest reuiue vs, tokedst vs out from the depth of the earth.
Thou hast encreased our honor, and returning didst comfort vs. Strangers rose vp against vs and vnto vs. Admonish our soules of miseries to come.
Euen as thou diddest arme the Patriarches, and Prophets by dreames, and visions in the night, when sleepe came vpon them from da~gers nigh at hand through thine heauenlie oracles: so gouerne and preserue vs in sleepe that our soules come not into danger, neither fal vpon the sword, and pit of perils.
Defende vs this night from vncleane and troblesome Spirits let not their rushings, ragings, and misrule disquiet vs. Kepe vs, good God, from sights of Satan, from snares and illusions of the Diuel.
thou maker of al things, according to thy woonted goodnes, be thou our watchman and keeper: so shal no vaine apparitions and dreames of the night troble vs, nor the Diuel disquiet vs.
For in the waie of thy iudgements we doe looke for thee, Lord; the desire of our soule is to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee.
With our soules haue we desired thee in the night, and with our spirits within vs wil we seeke thee in the morning.
Our soules waite on the Lord more than the morning watch watcheth for the morning.
From the endes of the earth we wil crie vnto thee, when our harts be opprest, bring vs to the hie rock; for thou art our hope, a strong tower against the face of the enimie.
We wil dwel in thy tabernacle for euer, we shal be protected vnder the couering of thy wings.
Lengthen our daies and yeres according to thy good pleasure: for thy mercie and truth shal keepe vs. Christ our defender, beholde; represse our enimies; gouerne thy seruants which thou hast bought with thy precious blood; be mindful of vs, Lord, in this heauie bodie; thou which art the defender of the soule, be present with vs.
To God the Father, and to his onelie Sonne, with the Spirit the comforter, be al praise and glorie for euermore, Amen.
Almightie, and merciful GOD, which gauest the people of Israël in charge euerie daie both in the morning and at night to offer vnto thee a burnt offering for a sweete sauor in thine eares, that thereby they might glorifie thee and giue thee thankes for the benefite of their protection both night and daie: rising this morning we offer vp vnto thee the sacrifice of thankesgiuing
We glorifie thee, eternal God, for breaking the chaines of the darknes of this night.
We wil offer vnto thee a sacrifice of praise, and cal vpon thy Name.
We wil praise our God which brought vs out of darknes and the shadowe of death, and brake the bonds wherewith we were tied this night; he hath deliuered our soules from perils by bringing vs safe and sound to the morning light.
Wherefore we offer before thee the calues of our lips for a morning sacrifice, and with our tongues doe we praise thee, Lord.
Our mouthes shal be filled with thy praise, and with thy glorie euerie daie.
Our tongues shal talke of thy righteousnes and saluation euerie daie.
Our lips shal speake of thy praise and our tongues shal entreate of thy worde.
Our soules shal be filled as it were with fatnes and with the lips of reioicing shal our mouth extol thee.
We wil praise thy Name with songs and magnifie thee with thankesgiuing, which please thee better than either oxe or calfe that hath hornes and hooues.
Wherefore let the sacrifice of our mouthes which we offer vnto thee now this morning, and the meditations of our hares be grateful in thy sight.
Lorde, we beseech thee accept the free offerings of our mouth and teach vs thy iudgements, that we may doe thy wil according to thy good pleasure.
Vnto thee, Lorde, we wil crie and earelie shal our praiers come before thee.
In this morning doe we beseech thee by the resurrection of our Lord Iesu Christ thy welbeloued Sonne, that, as he was raised from the dead by thy glorie: so thou wilt raise and lift vs vp this morning, that rising out of the filth of sinne, and leauing the beds of vnrighteousnes, we may put on the newe man which is renued in knowledge after the image of thee which didst create him, and giue not ouer our selues to sleepe and snorting.
Awake now our soules which sleepe; rise from the dead, Christ wil lighten yee.
For certes it is hie time that we should arise from sleepe the houre of our watching being nigh, and our saluation neerer than when we beleeued.
The night is passed, and the day is at hand.
Grant therfore merciful God, that casting of the works of darknes, and putting on the armour of light we may walke honestlie as in the daie, not in gluttonie, and drunkennes neither in chambering and wantonnes, nor in strife and enuieng, but may put on our Lord Iesu Christ by true faith, and good works which may smel of him, that tasting of his sweetenes, at no time we may be separated fro~ him.
Wherefore we beseech thee, Lord, continue thy goodnes toward vs, and grant that al our praiers and workes may both begin from thee, and ende through thee.
Let thy mercie be vpon vs as we trust in thee.
Lord, keepe our tongues from euil and our lips that they speake no guile.
Remoue from vs al filthy speech vanitie of wordes, and al scurrilitie, that we blab out nothing rashlie, or vndiscreetelie to the hurt of our neighbour.
Who shal set a locke vpon our mouth, and a sure seale vpon our lips? that we offende not in our speech, that our tongues do not destroie vs. Omnipotent GOD, put thou a watch vpon our mouth a doore vpon our lips, that our mouth transgresse not, neither our lips be opened to speake that is vnseemelie; that our mouthes may meditate vpon the truth and our lips abhor wickednes; that al the words of our mouthes may be syncere, and no lewdnes or frowardnes be found in them.
Grant merciful GOD, that descending into our soules we may reprehende and condemne the spots, and vices within vs, and not, forgetting our selues, iudge others, and therby fal into thy dreadful iudgements.
Lorde, deliuer vs from lieng lips, and from a deceitful tongue, whose mouth is softer than butter, and their words more gentle than oile, and are most pearcing dartes.
They haue sharpened their tonges like serpents the poison of aspes is vnder their lips.
Sende thy word and heale vs, Lord, through our Sauior Christ thy beloued Sonne, Amen.
WE giue thee thanks, Father, Lord of heauen earth, because thou hast hid the mysterie of thy worde, which is the Gospel of our saluation by thy Sonne, from the wise, and men of vnderstanding in this world, and hast reuealed the same to babes of base degree: certainlie such was thy good pleasure.
Thou hast giuen vs al things in thy Sonne, whom none knoweth but thou Father; neither doth any knowe thee except thy Sonne, and he to whom thy Sonne shal reueale thee.
We worship thee, we praise thee, we glorifie thee, we giue thee tha~ks for the hid wisedome which thou didst determine before the worlde, for our glorie, which was neuer knowne to the Princes of this world, nor at any time to the sonnes of men, as it is now reuealed by the Spirit, to knowe the communion of the mysterie, which was hid from al ages but is nowe opened to thy Saints, to whom thou woldest haue made knowen, what be the riches of this glorious mysterie.
It is thine owne working, and of thy free mercie that we are made heires and partakers of the promise in Christ Iesu through the Gospel, which bringeth vs tydings, and assurance of the euerlasting riches of thine infinit goodnes and mercie.
Blessed be God· euen the Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, which hath blessed vs with al spiritual blessings in heauenlie things by Christ, and hath chosen vs in him before the foundations of the worlde, that we shoulde be holie and without blame before him by loue, who hath predestinated vs to be adopted through Iesus Christ vnto himselfe, according to the good pleasure of his wil, whereby he loueth vs by his beloued, in whom we haue redemption by his blood, euen the forgiuenes of sinnes, according to the riches of his grace, wherin he hath abounded towarde vs in al wisedome and vnderstanding, hath opened vnto vs the mysterie of his wil according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himselfe, euen vntil the dispensation of the fulnes of time, that he might gather in one al things, both which are in heauen and which are in earth, euen in Christ, by whom also we are chosen when we were predestinated according to the purpose of him which maketh al things after the counsel of his owne wil, that we might be to the praise of his glory which hoping haue beleeued in Christ when we heard the worde of truth, euen the Gospel of saluation.
And this grace thou didst extend toward vs, not by the works of righteousnes which we had done, but according to thy mercie thou sauedst vs, and diddest cal vs with an holie calling, not according to our works but according to thine owne purpose and grace, which was giuen to vs through Christ before al times, and is now made manifest by the appearing of our Sauior Iesus Christ, which hath abolished death, and brought life and immortalitie vnto light through the Gospel.
To thee therefore which art of power to establish our harts according to the reuelation of the mysterie which was kept secret since the world began, (but now is opened, and published among al nations by the scriptures of the Prophets, at the commandement of the euerlasting GOD for the obedience of faith) to thee, we saie, God onelie wise, be praise through Iesu Christ for euer, Amen.
We beseech thee, that according to the operation and working of thy mightie power, we may continue constant in true faith and wholsome doctrine, and at no time, forsaking the wisedome opened in the Gospel, may follow the iudgement of worldlie reason, and fleshlie vnderstanding which thou hast besotted, and altogether confounded in searching thy hidden mysteries.
For that spiritual wisdome doth far exceede al wisedome and vnderstanding of the creatures, whervnto flesh cannot attaine, neither can our blood reueale, nor yet the natural man although he be endued with great sharpnes of wit, and worldlie vnderstanding, perceiue the same.
Grant we beseech thee, that we may be thy simple, and little ones receiuing from thee the worde of truth without contradition and disputation, and that in the articles of faith wee bring not fleshlie wisedome, but, being made voide of our proper vnderstanding may bring our mindes into a godlie captiuitie.
Let thy Sonne, which descending from about brought with him the eternal wisdome of the Gospel from thy bosome, and was made a sacrifice on our behalfe, but now exalted to thy right hande bestoweth his gifts let him, we beseech thee shine in our harts.
Likewise cause thine holie Spirit to instil into vs his diuine light, and breath vpon vs the newe flame of thine heauenlie knowledge, til departing into the eternal life we may beholde thee the onelie and true God face to face, which liuest and raignest in perpetual glorie, Amen.
Christ, Sonne of God, which art the syncere and perfect charitie louing vs euen to the ende, and thereby didst suffer a cruel death vpon the altar of the crosse to deliuer vs from euerlasting death, and perpetual torments, and to allure vs by that thine example to amitie.
That as thy wil was to suffer death on our behalfe: so we hauing the riches of this worlde, shoulde be so far from keeping back our almes and reliefe from the poore, or shutting vp our bowels of compassion fro~ them, that in the case of necessitie, we should giue our liues for our brethren.
For both our profession requireth the same, and it is the token whereby the true Christians are knowen, according to thy worde By this shal men know that ye are my disciples, if ye loue one another.
Which loue ought to be the rule of al our actions.
For al things are to be examined by the rule of charitie, which being banished al other gifts are corrupt and profite nothing.
We besech thee by thine hote burning, and abundant loue, enflame our cold harts with the affection of vnfained good wil, that we may loue thee the Father, and the holie Spirit in one eternal and inseperable essence, aboue al things with our whole hart, with al our soule, and with al our strength; and keepe that commandement which againe peculiarlie thou didst commend vnto vs, saieng new commandement giue vnto you, that yee loue one another: as haue loued you, that euen so ye loue one another.
Thou likewise, Sonne of God, when thy death was nigh didst beg, that the loue where with the eternal Father loueth thee, may be in thy seruants, Expresse in vs the similitude of thy good wil, and turne vs into such a shape, that our soules, by the light and motion of the holie Spirit may be coupled with thine eternal Father; and that the image of like integritie knowledge, righteousnes, and affections may shine in vs, as doth in thee, which art the brightnes of the eternal Father in the most pleasant and perpetual harmonie.
Raise vp in vs a desire of brotherlie and entire good wil, that euery one may haue a care to helpe his brother; euen as members of one bodie haue a mutual compassion ech of other, so we may loue among our selues vnfainedlie, and abounde in mutual friendship one towards another, that our harts may be confirmed, and vnblameable in holines before God.
Giue grace that our loue may be perfect, wanting no part due vnto the same, not fained false, or hypocritical, not waiward, tedious, disdainful, nor hunting after profit.
Grant therefore that we may abhor that which is euil, and be affectioned to loue one another with brotherlie loue. Make vs patient bountiful, not enuious, no boasters, not puffed vp, not proud, no seekers of our owne, not easie to be moued vnto anger, no thinkers of euil, no reioicers in wickednes but reioicers in the truth; to suffer al things, beleeue al things, hope al things, and so to loue one another mutuallie not in word and tong onlie, but in deede and truth; not abusing christian libertie as an occasion vnto the flesh, but by loue to serue one another.
Inflame our brests, that after thine example we may vnfeinedlie loue euen our verie enimies and blesse them that cursse vs; doe good vnto them which hate and hurt vs, leauing reuengement alwaies to thee.
lambe of God which takest away the sinnes of the worlde, take from vs al bitternes anger, and wrath, and crieng, and euil speaking with al maliciousnes.
For he which loueth not his brother knoweth not God, but abideth in death, and doth vainlie boast against the truth.
Grant therefore to vs which are translated from death to life, that retaining the studie of concord we may loue one another, and put away bitter emulation, forgiuing al men euen from the hart, euen as thou hast forgiuen vs.
Let not the sunne go downe vpon our wrath, giuing place to the Diuel, but let vs be quiet, putting on tender mercie, kindnes, humblenes of minde, meekenes, and aboue al, charitie, which is the bond of perfection, the ende of the commandement the fulfilling of the law so that by loue our faith may be fruitful and we at no time seuered from thee.
For thou art loue and he that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in thee, and thou in him: so that no creature can separate such a man from the loue of God which is in Christ Iesu, which liuest and raignest with the Father and the holie Spirit, a true, and one God in the loue of the perpetual vnitie worldes without ende, Amen.
Lord, God almightie, King of heauen and earth, which of thine aboundant goodnes dost adorne, and replenish the earth with al kinde of frute and graine, whereby the life both of man beast is sustained: We beseech thee euen of thy free mercie that thou wouldest vouchsafe to blesse our fields and ground, and to make them prosperouslie to yeelde their corne and encrease.
For without thy blessing and fauor, neither can the earth of it selfe, bring foorth any whit, nor we by our paines make the same to prosper.
Wherefore grant to al thinges springing from the earth a meete temperature of aire, that luckilie they may take and encrease.
Keepe our frute vpon the face of the earth from al infection of the aire, from thunder, haile from vntimelie showers, from too great drines, and ouermuch heate, from wormes hurtful, beasts deuouring it before their prime; and from al other corruption, that our lande in thine anger be not desolate, and denie vs frute, enioieng hir woful Sabbaoth.
Shut not vp the heauens in thine indignation for our sinnes, that it be not as iron nor our earth as brasse, whereby it cannot be tilled, ploughed, nor sowed, and so come to a verie plaine, and vtter wildernes: but of thy goodnes giue vs both the earelie and latter raine that we may haue abundance of al frute, and a ioieful haruest with a plentiful vintage.
God, send a gracious raine vpon thine inheritance and giue thy blessing, that our grounde may bring forth hir frute.
Cause thy raine to poure downe in due season that it may be raine of blessing, whereby both trees may giue their frute, and the grounde yeeld forth hir graine.
Grant also that the aier be pure from infection; our bodies free from sickenes; to our whole realme peace and quietnes, that safelie without troble we may enioie thy gifts.
Driue away and repel from vs malediction and the destroier
Giue vs not in steede of raine dust and ashes: but open thy good treasure, and visit the land with thy blessing; make it drunken, and enrich it abundantlie.
Thy riuer, Lorde, is ful of water prepare our corne, dispose our earth to prosper; water abundantlie the furrowes of the same, and cause the raine to descend into the valleies thereof, make the same soft with showers, and blesse our buddes.
Crowne the yeare with thy goodnes, and let thy clowdes drop fatnes.
Let them drop vpon the pastures of the wildernes, and make the litle hils reioice on euerie side.
Let the plaines be replenished with sheepe, and the valleies with corne, that the inhabiters of the earth may reioice and be merie.
Lorde, thou causest grasse to grow for cattel and herbes for the vse of ma~, thou bringest forth bread out of the earth, and wine to make glad the hart of man, oile to make the countenance cheereful, bread for to strengthen the hart.
Haue therefore a care, heauenlie Father, of the seede other things springing from the earth; keepe them both in cold, raine, ice, snow, from the beating of winds, and iniurie of weather.
Preserue the~ in extreeme heate, drines, moistnes, and such like, that they perish not afore their time.
Roote out the destroier, that there be neither mildew, nor grashopper, neither caterpiller hurting the frute of the earth.
Keepe vs, Lord, in the time of dearth that we perish not for hunger; nor be confounded in the perilous time.
For thou art our GOD Creator, which satisfiest the thirstie soule and fillest the hungrie with goodnes; which hast saide wil not faile neither forsake thee: wherby being faithful we may say The Lord is with vs, therfore we wil not feare what man can do vnto vs. Behold we miserable and great sinners doe confesse our wickednes with groanings and griefe of hart crieng vnto thee which art in heauen.
Heare our praiers in thy dwelling place and be merciful to thy people which haue sinned against thee; and forgiue al our iniquities, wherein wee haue transgressed against thee.
By our sinnes we haue brought al these miseries, which hang ouer our heads, but blot out al our offences, God, after thy manifold mercies, take awaie from vs the curse of our ground, that the people may praise thee God, yea, that al the people may praise thee, and the earth bring foorth hir encrease, through our Lord Iesu Christ, thine onelie sonne, which liueth and raigneth with thee in the vnitie of the holie Spirit a God for euermore, Amen.
Eternal Father, maker gouernor of al the worlde, from the bottome of our harts we thanke thee in the Name of our Lord Iesu Christ, for that thou hast not vtterlie cast away mankinde hauing fallen from the state of paradise by sinne, into euerlasting damnation, as thou didst the Diuels: but of thine vnspeakeable goodnes, through thy secret counsaile wouldest nedes that thy Sonne should take our flesh vpon him, be a mediator betweene thee and vs, and be sacrificed for our sinnes For, thou wilt not the death of a sinner, neither art thou delighted in the destruction of the wicked, but that he repent and liue.
Againe, thy Sonne came not to cal the righteous, but sinners to repentance
We beseech thee on the behalfe of al sinners; for al in bondage to Satan; and for as many as are ouerwhelmed in wickednes, grant them grace, merciful God, that they may escape the snares of the Diuel, and acknowledge their offences; strike into them a feare of thine indignation, and paines of hel, that their minds be not darkned and so they become strangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardnes of their hart: that they come not to that passe that they forsake al sorrowing, so giue themselues to co~mit wantonnes euen with gredines.
For they which breake thy precepts wilfullie, and haue no feare nor feeling of thy iudgements, but runne on securelie, pleasing themselues, taking pleasure in their impietie; whose consciences do soundlie sleepe (the feare of thy iudgement being cleane extinguished in them) and prostitute themselues to al vncleannes, they heape vnto themselues the wrath of God according to their hardnes, and harts which cannot repent, giue themselues ouer into reprobate mindes to doe those things as be vncomelie, being ful of al vnrighteousnes, fornication, wickednes, couetousnes, malice, ful of enuie, of murther, of debate, of deceipt, corrupted in manners, whisperers; backbyters, haters of God, dooers of wrong, proude, boasters, inuenters of euil things, disobedient to parents, without vnderstanding, breakers of promises, far from al charitable affection; yea they giue themselues wholie to the works of the flesh that so, forgoing al sense of godlines, they may obstinatelie go forward in wickednes to their euerlasting perdition.
Bring them, merciful God, to thy truth, and giue them grace vnfeinedlie to repent, and to escape the snares of Satan wherein they are intangled, and deteined at his pleasure.
Take away stubbornes, hardnes of their minde, and this damnable securitie, that wickednes doe not vtterlie blinde them.
Bestow vpon them a new hart, and put a new spirit within them, take away that stonie hart out of their flesh and giue them a fleshie hart, and put thy spirit within their brestes.
Merciful God, guide vs with thine holie Spirit, that bewailing our sins from the bottome of our harts, we may flie to thine vnspeakeable mercie, which thou dost promise to as manie as in faith turne vnto thee: and laieng away (as concerning the conuersation in times past) the old man, which is corrupt through the deceaueable lustes, may be renued in the spirit of our minds, and put on the newe man, which after God is created in righteousnes and true holines.
Assist vs, God, that putting away lieng, we may speake euery one the truth to his neighbor, because we are the members one of another; and in anger offende not.
Let him that stoale, steale no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may giue vnto him which needeth.
Come into our harts through thy word, and by thy Spirit begin a new and holie life; stir vp good motions agreeable to thy wil, and answering to the rule of thy worde reuealed in the congregation.
For thou God art rich towards, and ouer al that cal vpon thee, and repent.
Yea, it is not thy wil that any of the least should perish but that al be saued and come to the knowledge of the truth.
And for this cause, no man be he neuer so wicked, ought to despaire.
For it is a true saieng and by al meanes worthie to be receaued, That Christ Iesus came into the worlde to saue sinners, and so verie many, being somtime notable transgressors, haue attained mercie, for an example to such, as afterwarde shoulde beleeue on him to their euerlasting happines.
Giue vs therefore, most gentle God, that we may throughlie examine our waies and trie them, and returne to thee, Lorde: lifting vp our harts with our hands vnto thee which art in the heauens.
We, which haue sinned and rebelled, with griefe and sorrowe of hart acknowledge al our filthie faults, and with a true faith approch to the throne of thy grace, trusting in the reconciliation made by thy Sonne our propitiator, and raised vp in his faithful and infallible promise we purpose through thine assistance to begin a newe life, to the glorie and praise of thy sacred Name, Amen.
Christ, which art the virtue that is made perfect in infirmitie the strength of the weake, the saluation of al beleeuers, an aider of the oppressed a refuge in the time of troble a physition for the sicke, yea, our life and salfegard in the peril of death: By al thy paines passions (which thou didst suffer for vs, and wherby in the flesh thou tookedst vppon thee thou feelest our infirmities) we beseech thee, that pittieng our sicknes, and diseases, thou wilt succor al that are sicke, and especiallie such, as in their agonies do encounter with many sondrie tentations.
Giue them grace to know that al sicknes and miseries of the bodie whatsoeuer come not by chance, but to be sent of thee our God; without whose wil and permission none aduersitie can come vpon vs.
Let them knowe that sicknes is sent through thy good counsaile, not for our destruction, but for our amendment, and to cal vs vnto repentance; and either to keepe vs in our calling, or to driue vs from wickednes (whervnto by nature we are inclined) For when we are iudged we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the worlde.
Finallie diseases be certaine instruments whereby thou dost exercise vs to the mortification of our flesh.
thou most excellent curer both of soules and bodies diseased, which hast showen that sicknes, and miseries of the bodie are the punishments of sinne and warnings of thy displeasure against our wickednes: Spare vs, Lorde, spare thy people and forgiue our sinnes, whereby we haue prouoked these manifold diseases and miseries.
Speake vnto our trobled harts in this conflict of the conscience, reuiue them with the sweete and liuelie comfort of the free remission of our sinnes purchased by Christ and take awaie the prick of sinne, and stings of death, that we feele not the gnawing worme of a guiltie conscience.
Grant vs quiet mindes through the consolation of the scriptures and working of the holie Ghost, that we may surelie rest vpon thee and thy promises, neuer doubting of thy fatherlie kindnes toward vs. Heate our colde harts, and fainting members by thy Spirit, that they may be nimble to fulfil thy pleasure, and suffer afflictions laide vpon them, with a quiet minde; and neuer murmuringlie resist thy wil, but alwaies thinke, that whom the Lord loueth him he chasteneth; and scourgeth euerie sonne, that he receiueth.
Therefore strengthen vs, that we may suffer thy fatherlie correction with quiet minds.
Lord, looke downe from heauen, from thine holie Court, and behold the humilitie and affliction of al weake persons: take from them their extreme paine, or at the least mitigate their sorrowes, whereby they may feele some ease, and let thy yoke be vnto them easie, and thy burden light.
Restore the weake to their woonted strength, and heale their griefes according to thy diuine pleasure to their welfare.
Wype away alteares from their eies, and helpe them on the bed of their sorow and make their beds in their weakenes.
Heale and bind vp their wounds, for great is thy power and thine hand is not shortened
For when al hope (of worldlie helpe) doth faile, that can assist.
Thy mightie right hande can alter euery thing, yea, if thou onlie saie the word the weake shal be healed, that without the means of any natural thing.
Grant likewise that al which are recouered may wel vse their health (least otherwise they forgo through sin y^ which they receiued by grace) be thankful, alwaies warie least a woorse thing happen vnto them.
And concerning such as it pleaseth thee to take out of this miserable worlde into thine euerlasting kingdome, confirme those with thine holie Spirit, that at the houre of their departure they may peaceably rest vpholden with a trust of free remission of their sinnes, and hope of a ioieful resurrection of the dead, and life euerlasting.
Shorten the paines which they suffer now in their mortal bodies, and turne their sorrow into perfect and eternal ioie and make them willing to be dissolued from their bodies to be with thee, and to withdraw themselues from al such things as doe hinder the spiritual course, as are the loue of this present life, the pleasures of the world, the desires of the flesh, earthlie cogirations, riches, and vaine glorie.
Christ our eternal Sauior, we beseech thee, which, hauing ouercome the sting of death, hast opened the kingdome of heauen to al beleeuers, according to our faith, wilt come to be the iudge of the quick and dead, haue mercie on thy seruants whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood, Amen.
Most heauenlie Father and eternal God, vnto thee do we crie, protect strengthen vs weake and feeble ones against the tentation of Satan, which is the sworne and extreeme enimie to mans saluation, a slanderer, and our accuser, that great Dracon the old serpent, which is called the Diuel, carrieng away the whole world, a coosener, wicked spirit; a deceauer, which goeth about like a roaring Lion seeking whom he may deuour.
And especiallie in this doting age of the world, as he knoweth his time of raigning is but short perceiueth the day of iudgement to be verie nigh at hand, wherein his filthines shal be made manifest to al creatures, to his euerlasting torments: so now he rageth, and raungeth in a deadlie hatred against thy flock, by al meanes seketh the destruction of al mankind, diuers waies, and by vnspeakeable subtiltie doth he laie snares to entrap our soules; egerlie doth he beset vs, and al his power and pollicie doth he powre out against vs, he prieth for any occasion, wherby he may allure vs to shameful offending, and so at length horriblie to cast vs headlong into extreeme desperation.
For as many corporal affections as be in man, so many occasions doth he take to tempt vs, thereby to wound vs, or at least to hurt vs with one prick or other.
He laieth snares to take vs in wealth, in pouertie, in pleasure, and in the inticements of the flesh, in anguish of minde, in ambition and desire of glorie, in the wearisomnes of our calling and inferior condition, in cares both for the back and bellie; in couetousnes and loue of monie, in lust of reuenge.
He ticles some with a desire of glorie and promotion; he imprinteth in others a vaine of curiositie and pride; into others he instilleth suspicions and doubtings of thy diuine wil and prouidence; he bloweth into others a perswasion of wisedome and knowledge; some he carieth awaie in securitie; night and daie whether we sleepe or wake he is about vs, with foming mouth, and open iawes, neieth to deuour vs that our senses may be corrupted from the simplicitie, which we owe to Christ, euen as the serpent deceaued Eaue by his subteltie.
God, who is able to flie awaie; or to persist against so diuers strokes and assaults of the Diuel? Vnles thou, most mightie protector, defend vs, alas we perish.
For thou knowest we are too weak to resist, no strength is in vs, no aid, prudence, or policie is in our nature against so strong and subtile an enimie.
Beholde, our nature is accursed vncleane, our flesh is weake, our life transitorie; and we, alas therefore, be cowardes and without armor, giuen to sleepe and slothfulnes and endeuor not couragiouslie to withstand the fraudes of the Diuel.
Wherefore expel from vs this deepe sluggishnes of ours, open the eies of our mindes that we may behold how great the power, endeuors, strength, and malice of this aduersarie is, with whom we are to encounter.
For we wrestle not against flesh blood but against rules, against powers, against gouernors, and rulers of the darknes of this world, against spiritual wickednes in heauenlie places.
thou Sonne of God, which art that blessed seede broozing the head· of the most subtile serpent, bring and brooze our enimie Satan vnder thy feete
Thou which didst appere to destroie the works of the Diuel, driue awaie from vs lieng Spirits, that they hurt vs not.
Thou our chiefe champion, which of thine owne accord enteredst into tentations that so thou mightest, as it were, hand to hand wrestle with our enimie, and purchase a triumph for vs by thy victorie, hold him fast bound that he exercise not his deuises vpon vs, as he desireth: make vs partakers of thy victorie, that euen as thou in thy bodie ouer camest the diuel so thou wilt vtterlie dispatch him in thy members.
And therefore giue vnto vs thine whole armor that like right soldiors we may resist in the euil daie, and vanquish our enimie.
Girde vs with the truth; put vpon vs the of righteousnes; and let vs be shod to the propagation of the Gospel of peace; Aboue al things giue vs the shield of faith, which can extinguish al the fierie darts of wicked spirits.
Bestow vpon vs the helmet of saluation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God, that through thee we may encounter valiantly, and gloriouslie attaine the victorie.
And holie Spirit, almightie God, comfort thou, and strengthen our minds against so diuers conflicts of Satan, which besetteth vs by manie snares, and especiallie then most of al doth he seeke our destruction, when we seke deliuerance by other meanes than by thy word reuealed: grant therefore that, leauing thy worde deliuered vnto vs, we looke not after new reuelations, or violent rauishings, but may resist the Diuel by thy word, so wil he flie from vs, Amen.
Lorde God, which art our life and the length of our daies, our vpholder protecting vs from our youth: we thanke thee this euening, and with our lips wee extol thy woonderful goodnes, because thou hast defended vs this daie against al aduersities both of bodie and soule.
Lord, vnto thee doe we crie heare vs, harken vnto our voice when we crie vnto thee.
Let our praiers be directed in thy sight as the incense, and let the lifting vp of our hands be an euening sacrifice.
For thou delitest not in the offering of Buls and Rams, but the sacrifice of thankesgiuing shal honor thee.
Who so keepeth the Law bringeth offerings enough; he that holdeth fast the commandement offereth an offering of saluatio~.
He that is thankful to them which haue wel deserued, offereth fine flower; and he that giueth almes, sacrificeth praise.
Therefore in this doe we offer vnto thee the continual sacrifice of thankesgiuing, praising thy goodnes for thy merciful protection and defence.
We wil commend thee for thy truth, and sing of thee, thou most Hie; Our lips shal sing of thee, and our soules which thou hast redeemed, yea and our tongues shal dailie speake of thy righteousnes, because they are confounded and put to shame that sought after our soules.
We wil giue thankes vnto thee Lorde, with our whole hart, because thou hast heard al the words of our mouthes.
In the sight of the Gods we wil praise thee.
We wil worship toward thine holy Temple, and celebrate thy Name, because of thy great mercie truth.
For thou hast magnified thy Name, and thy word aboue al things.
Whensoeuer we called vpon thee thou diddest heare vs, and enduedst our soules with much strength.
And now we crie vnto thee, Lorde, with our voice, yea in thy sight doe we poure out our praiers, and in our troble doe we vtter them before thee, that thou maiest pardon al our offences, and those especiallie which we haue committed this daie.
Bring not into thy iudgement, Lord, al our idle and vaine words pardon our babling, vaine speech, and impute not our foolishnes vnto vs. Be merciful vnto vs, Lord, for we are greatlie pensiue for our sins, our harts be trobled within vs, and the feare of death is fallen vpon vs. Fearefulnes trembling are come vpon vs and an horrible dread hath ouerwhelmed vs.
But, Lord, absolue vs from al our sinnes through thy worde bringing vnto vs the ioieful tydings of gratious deliuerance.
comfort the harts of thy seruants for vnto thee, Lord, haue we lifted vp our soules.
For thou art milde, gentle, and of much mercie to as manie as cal vpon thee.
Blessed be the Lorde which hath heard the voice of our humble petitions
God thou art our strength, and our shield, our harts trusted in thee and we are holpen, therefore our harts doe daunce for ioie, and in our songes we wil praise thee.
We cried vnto thee, Lord, and saide Thou art our hope, and our portion in the lande of the liuing.
deliuer vs from our persecutors: for they are too strong for vs. Bring our soules out of prison, that we may giue thanks vnto thy Name.
holie Trinitie, and perpetual vnitie, protect vs this night, that the Diuel haue no power ouer vs. Father gouerne vs by thy power; Sonne, reuiue vs with thy wisedome; and lighten vs, holie Ghost, with thy virtue.
Creator be thou present with vs; Redeemer, aide vs; our Comforter abide with vs.
The Lorde make his face to shine vpon vs, and be merciful vnto vs; the Lorde lift vp his countenance vpon vs, and giue vs peace.
This blessing of God be this night and euermore a safetie, protection against al enimies, both visible and inuisible, that they hurt vs not anie waie.
Euen as the piller of cloude in the desert stood betweene the tents of the Egyptians, and the tents of the children of Israël, that none hurt might come to the people of Israël: so be thou, Lord, the protector of our soules, and liues; be thou, we beseech thee, an iron piller vnto vs that such as are our enimies preuaile not against vs, and be thou a brazen wal betweene vs, and al our aduersaries, that they come not nie vs to our hurt.
Giue vs this night a good sleepe, that quietlie without cares and anguish of minde we may rest this night; let not troblesome dreames, and fantasies in which is vanitie disquiet vs.
Let our sleepe be sweet, helthful to our bodies, that waking in the morning we may rise in good helth, and delight in thee our God.
Grant also that both being in bed, a sleepe, and awake we may alwaies remember our death, which is a passage to an immortal life, and withal our ioieful resurrection to euerlasting glorie, Amen.
Christ which art the light and the daie dwelling in the light that no man can attaine vnto, the brightnes and cleerenes of the eternal Father, the bright morning Star driuing away the darcknes of night, and bringing the light of the daie ouer the face of the earth: We wil blesse thee in our life time, and lift vp our hands in thy Name with thankesgiuing, because thou hast bin our defender
Thou hast beheld our miseries, and hast not put vs into the handes of our enimies which did whisper against vs imagine euil toward vs; they spake euil of vs, that when we slepe we might rise no more.
But thou, Lord, tookedst compassion vpon vs, and didst raise vs againe, thou didst aide vs with thine arme of strength, and defend vs against al our enimies, and their inuasions with thy mightie power.
Vnder the shadow of thy wings we rested quietlie, in thy lap we laie secure and safe.
We slept and toke our rest, and yet rose againe.
God is in the mids of vs, therefore we wil not be mooued, God wil helpe vs and that right earelie, that we may reioice in his saluatio~.
thou onelie begotten Sonne of God, which sittest at the right hand of God thine almightie Father, we most humblie beseech thee by thy glorious ascention into the heauens wherby thou didst pierce the thick cloudes, that thou mightest put away our iniquities like a cloude wype away our sinnes, wherby thou, which art the Sonne of righteousnes, art hidden, that neither our soules can behold thee, neither our praiers ascende vnto thee, like a myst: Let thy light shine ouer vs this daie (like the cleere daie star piercing the thick mystes) to the expelling of the darknes of our vnderstanding
For thou art the true light lightning euerie man that commeth into this world.
Clarifie our harts, and driue away the darknes of error and ignorance, that, as at the breaking of the daie darkenes doth vanish: so al the darknes of our mindes may be remoued, that we continue not in the dongeon and shadow of death, but may approch to thy word as to a candle shining in a darke place, vntil the daie dawne, and thou the day star arise in our harts.
Let thy worke appere to thy seruants and thy magnificence towards the sonnes of men.
The glorious maiestie of the Lorde be vpon vs, and prosper the workes of our hands vpon vs; prosper the works of our hands.
Let vs not, forgetting thy commandements, decline from them either to the right hand or to the left, but make vs to meditate vpon them rising out of our beds, bind them for a signe vpon our hands and tie them to our fingers, write them on the table of our harts, that the memorie of them at no time depart out of our minds.
Lorde, we haue called vpon thee daie by daie we haue stretched out our hands vnto thee.
In our troble doe we lift vp our hands vnto thee, Lorde, beseeching thee most humbly to kepe vs this daie, and al our life time from the place of hel and to deliuer vs from the clawes of the vngodlie.
Lord, be merciful vnto vs, we haue longed for thee, be thou our helpe and shield our saluation in the time of troble.
Send downe thine hand from aboue and deliuer vs. Stretch forth thine arme with power, strengthen thine hand, lift vp thy right hand to saue vs. Arise now, Lorde, put forth thine hand, forget not the poore.
Breake thou the power of the vngodlie and malitious, that we without feare of danger may confesse and praise thee.
Though we walke in the middes of troble yet wilt thou refresh vs; against the furiousnes of our enimies wilt thou stretch forth thine hand, and thy right hand shal saue vs, that al may knowe and vnderstand that this is thine hand, and that thou hast saued vs.
Therefore we wil praise the Lord which stood at the right hand of the poore to saue his soule from the persecutors.
most mightie protector, keepe vs likewise from al bodilie harme.
Deliuer vs from the myre that we perish not, deliuer vs from such as hate vs, and from the deepe waters, that the fluds ouerwhelme vs not, neither the deepe swalow vs vp; protect vs with thine hand that we perish not by thy firie darts.
Thou God rulest the virtues of the elements, which thou hast created, and guidest the raging of the sea
For thou art the God which framest the mountaines, makest the winds, and declarest vnto man what his thought is, thou makest the morning and darknes, and walkest vpon the hie places of the earth, the Lord God of Hostes is thy Name worlds without ende, Amen.
WE thanke thee, King of glorie, Lord of heauen earth, because thou hast from our youth to this present houre maruelouslie nourished vs, giuing vs meat, drinke, and clothing with al other thinges pertaining to the sustentation of this our life.
Naked and bare came we out of our mothers wombes we brought nothing into the world but whatsoeuer we haue thou gauest the same; yea, it was afore we were borne; and in our mothers wombe didst thou ordaine things necessarie for this life, and sufferest vs to enioie al things abundantlie.
Alwaie thou hast a care of vs, as a father hath of his children; neither art thou ignorant that we stand in neede continuallie of thy blessings, and dailie are destitute of new reliefe: al which thou giuest after thy wonted, and vnspeakable goodnes.
We acknowledge that whatsoeuer we haue, or possesse, it is thy gift; confesse thee to be the fountaine of al good things and perceiue thy Fatherlie goodnes to be spread not onelie ouer al mankind, but also ouer the brute creatures.
Thou giuest meat to al flesh; thou giuest fodder to the Cattel; and feedest the yong rauens that cal vpvpon thee
For corporal goodes are not distributed among men by chance, or without thy prouidence; neither be they attained by the onelie industrie and power of man.
Thou giuest and we gather; thou openest thine hande, and al liuing creatures are filled with thy blessing.
For without thee al our endeuors be in vaine, and if thou blesse not our labors, we do but beate the winde and receiue no profite.
Great is thy mercie, Lorde, which disdainest not to prouide for sinful flesh.
Lord our God, great are thy wonderous works which thou hast done for vs, the which we can not so much as in thought comprehend, much lesse in words expresse.
When we would report and vtter them, we founde them moe than we coulde recite.
But notwithstanding thine infinite benefits cannot be comprehended of man: yet wil we not surcesse to set forth thy praise, nor hide thy goodnes from the sonnes of men, but wil declare it and speake of thy truth from one generation to another.
Blessed art thou, our God, for euer and euer al that is either aboue in the heauens, or in earth beneath, is thine.
Al things come from thee, and from thine hands we receiue whatsoeuer we possesse.
And al those things of thy meere mercie without our merits or worthines.
Therefore we wil magnifie the Lord, which doth mightie things in al the corners of the earth, which doth nourish vs from our mothers wombes and giueth vs al good things.
Grant vs likewise quietnes of minde, and peace in our time, that thy grace may abound towarde vs, continue, and defende vs while we liue.
Almightie and merciful Father, by thy breath we toke life the which through thy blessing doth abide in vs.
For man liueth not by bread onelie or by his owne wisedome and forecast, neither art thou bounde with a fatal chaine of second causes, but by thy decree and wil we enioie life, al things created at thy beck doe continue while thou thinkest good.
Giue vs not onelie store of al things to the necessitie of our life: but grant also to our meate drink virtue and power to relieue and strengthen our bodies.
For thou alone vpholdest al thinges by thy worde of power
Vnles thou dailie didst feede vs with thy hidden grace, which thou dost enspire into the bread to feede vs, al the heapes of our yeerelie encrese were to smal purpose.
For be it, that there be abundance of wheat, wine, and of al other things: yet vnles they be watred by thy blessing quicklie would al come to naught, and we shoulde perish for lacke of foode in al that abundance.
For al the substance which we possesse, what is it without thou prosper and fructifie the same with thy blessing.
And albeit we feede on bread yet we ascribe not our life to the virtue of the bread; neither is thy power tied to the bread; nor mans life included within the same, but altogether it dependeth vpon thy wil and good pleasure.
We besech thee for thy most large and bountiful liberalitie, cast vs not of in the time of our old age; and when our strength faileth vs, forsake vs not.
Likewise confirme our faith that we distrust not thy promises; neither be we driuen from thee by any meanes, seeme they neuer so contrarie to natural causes: but giue grace that we may withdrawe our eies from al wordlie consultations, and, as touching our foode, and other necessaries for this life, may wholie depend vpon thee, and at no time go beyond the limits which thou hast prescribed, through our Lord Iesu Christ, which liueth and raigneth with thee for euermore, Amen.
Eternal God, which hast called vs to the vnitie of the true catholike faith, and gathered vs by thy word into the lap of the Christian congregation, that we may be al of vs one bodie, and one spirit, euen as we are called in one hope of our calling.
One Lord, one faith, one baptisme, one God, and Father of al, which is aboue al, and through al, and in vs al.
For euen as thou Father art in thy Sonne, and he in thee so should we also be one in thee our God.
And therefore we crie vnto thee, almightie Father, and eternal God, teach vs thy waies that we may walke in thy truth; knit our harts vnto thee that we may feare thy Name.
Grant that al thy faithful may be like affected and of one minde, as thou art, thinking the same thing after the ensample of Christ our Sauior, and that as wel in minds as with mouth we may agree among our selues, both in true doctrine, and in outwarde behauior of conuersation.
For the scope of the Churches felicitie consisteth in the vnitie of true faith and religion.
Keepe vs in the true vnderstanding, and right knowledge of thy sacred scriptures, that without strife and contention, we may speake one thing Let there be no dissentions nor schismes among vs; let nothing be done through contention, or of vaine glorie, but let vs be one bodie, endued with one minde, and iudgement, according to thy worde reuealed, vntil we attaine to the vnitie of faith and knowledge of thy Sonne into a perfect man, according to the measure of the age of the fulnes of Christ, which is the head, by whom the whole bodie being copled and knit together by euerie ioint for the furniture therof, (according to the effectual power, which is in the measure of euerie part) receiueth encrease of the bodie, vnto the edifieng of it selfe in loue.
most holie Father, keepe vs by thy Name, that we may be one in thee and that among vs which are beleeuers, there may be one hart and one minde.
Christ our onelie Sauior and Mediator, which before thy passion didst praie that we might be one in thee euen as thou art in thy Father: grant that thy Church may be at concorde, and agree in one true faith and confession.
Let there continue among vs a godlie consent; let there be one agreement in faith, one mind in praier, that we may grow vp in thee, and that al our harts may be copled together by the bond of the Spirit, vsing thy gifts, as they should be, to the aduancement of thy glorie, and to the common profit both of thy Church and and walking worthie our calling whervnto we are called, with al humilitie gentlenes, with al lenitie forbearing one another through charitie, being careful to keepe the vnitie of the Spirit in the bonde of peace.
Represse the furiousnes of Satan which soweth discention among thy flock to weaken our faith, and to hinder our praiers, whereby thy glorie is defaced.
Grant therefore that we proue not desirous of vaine glorie prouoking one another, and enuieng one another, that we bite not one another to our destruction
For of emulation spring contentions which being once enflamed, boile out into mortal diuisions.
And as many as maintaine emulations, contentions, and factions, are carnal and walke as men.
Wherefore take from vs the zeale of the flesh, which is foolish.
And let al enuie wrath, pride, and arrogancie be far from vs. Likewise let vs auoide foolish and vnlearned questions, knowing that they engender strife and contention, and serue for nothing but to the subuerting of the hearers, and engrafting of errors.
Where a desire of strife is, there certainlie God dwelleth not and they which raise tumults of nothing, and disquiet thy flock, those wilt thou, Sonne of God, destroie.
Come holie Spirit, replenish the harts of the faithful, and inflame in them the fire of thy loue, which once didst gather the nations into the vnitie of the faith through the diuersitie of tongues Ioine our harts together, that we may nourish christian concorde among vs, and that we al glued, as it were together in louing harts, may be of one minde in thee; so shal thy pure doctrine zelouslie be maintained, and no false interpretation of the Scripture obstinatelie be defended.
Bring home to thy fold al such as are turned from the vnitie of true religion, that there may be one pastor and one folde
To such as are gone out from vs, grant constancie that they may continue with vs teaching the Gospel to the saluation of the hearers.
And if it fortune that any, contrarie to the doctrine which we haue learned, raise dissention and offences, grant that we may auoide them least the harts of the simple, through their sweete perswasions, and flatterie, be deceaued.
God, autor of peace and concorde, giue grace that euerie of vs may thinke the same thing according to our Sauiour Christ, Amen.
Most Hie God, and holie Father which art not the Autor of dissention but of peace not of confusion, nor of inordinate life, but the keeper of discipline and quietnes, from thee come holie cogitations, and good counsailes, and righteous deedes: Giue vnto vs thy seruants that peace which the world cannot giue, that both our harts and works may be applied to thy commandements, and that our daies, through thy protection, be alwaies quiet from troble.
Gouerne thou the whole state both of the Chuch and Common weale, and rule our life, that in our daies iustice may take place and peace continue as long as the moone shal haue hir course.
Speake thou peace vnto the common people, and ouer thy Saints, and likewise to them which are conuerted, and turned to a better minde.
Let thy saluation be nigh them that feare thee that glorie may dwel within our lande.
Let mercie and truth meete together, yea, let iustice and peace embrace ech other.
Let truth arise out of the earth, righteousnes looke downe from heauen.
Let the mountaines and the hils bring peace to thy people by iustice.
Blesse Lord al Countries, Cities, Townes, and places where thy word doth abide and is purelie preached.
Let them haue much peace that loue thy Lawe and doctrine, and let them be without stones to stumble at, and offences; let there be peace within their wals and prosperitie within their palaces.
Lord, strengthen the locks of our ports, and blesse thy children within them, put peace for our endes, and bounds; and fil vs with the fat of the corne, that thou King of glorie, and Lord of hostes maist enter by our gates and the pure worde may abide not onelie in our wals, but also in our wils, to the glorie of thy Name, and comfort of our soules; and that honest discipline together with integritie of virtue, maners, and humane literature may be maintained.
eternal God, which hast called vs in peace grant that with al men, as much as in vs lies we may haue peace; and let vs account of holines without which none shal see the Lord.
Asswage our harts, that we may cleane forget al iniuries, and forgiue ech other in many things, least by reuenging our selues we take awaie the publike tranquilitie.
Represse the Diuel, the breaker of godlie concord and christian peace, which ranging throughout al regions soweth euerie where the seede of strife and debate.
God of peace which makest an ende of war in al the worlde, and breakest the bowe, and knappest the speares asunder, and burnest the chariots with fire; protect vs from war and slaughter; scatter the nations that wish for war.
Breake thou and hinder al euil counsailes, and the purpose of such as mind and thirst after nothing els but the shedding of innocent blood.
Confound them in their imaginations that they take none effect, let them be turned back and put to shame.
Let them come to shame, and perish through their owne imaginations that Churches and schooles wel ordained be not ouerthrowne, nor Idolatrie get the dominion ouer vs. Ingraffe therefore into al men of what calling soeuer, a desire of peace; contented minds in their vocations, and a carefulnes to aduance the welfare of that place where they doe abide: so shal they, neither through a desire of others wealth, nor by ambition or vaine glorie raise any tumults to our disquietnes.
And where strife, contention, discord is among men, there doe thou, most mightie God, reconcile their harts and minds that those flames, and fires may speedilie be put out.
For thou canst conclude a truce for vs with the stones of the grounde; and compel the beasts of the fielde to seeke those things as belong to our peace, and the wolfe to dwel with the Lambe and the Leopard to lie downe with the Kid.
Therefore make our tabernacles safe quiet, that about them there may be a rich tranquilitie, which may abound like the streame running ouer his bank and our righteousnes as the waues of the sea, which is neuer without water.
In the Lorde shal we haue our wished peace, and the worke of righteousnes shal be peace hir frute rest and quietnes for euer.
And thy people shal dwel in the Innes of peace, and in sure dwellings, in safe places of comfort.
In ioie shal we go forth and returne in peace, the mountaines and hils shal sing with vs for ioie, and al the trees of the field shal clap their hands.
Heare vs, Lord of peace and grant that thy peace which passeth al vnderstanding, may keepe our harts and minds in our Lorde Iesu Christ, which liueth and raigneth with thee in the vnitie of the holie Spirit a God now, and for euermore, Amen.
VNto thee doe we crie, Lord, Father and maker of al men, which art rich vnto al that cal vpo~ thee and which commandest the light to shine out of darknes.
For thou wilt that al men should be saued, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
And therefore of thy great loue thou diddest cal vs to the participation of the lot of the Saints in light, which are by nature the children of wrath and of death; aliens and strangers from the testaments of promise, hauing none hope, and without God in the world: but now are fellowe Citizens with the Saints and of the housholde of GOD, built vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophetes, Iesus Christ being the head corner stone, which sustaineth the whole building by his word of power.
Heare vs thy seruants making supplication for such as yet haue not heard the sound of thy Gospel; neither knowen thy Name, but sitting in darknes and in the shadow of death, haue their minds darkned and are alienated from the life of God by the ignorance that is in them, and are carried away vnto dumbe Idols and fained Gods, euen as they are led, and runne to worship that which is no God.
Giue grace, that thy word may be knowen among them and preached in euerie land, and the sound thereof go out into the endes of the worlde that thou also maist be found of them which sought thee not, and famous among such as neuer asked after thee.
Send forth thy worde that they may be healed walke no more in the vanities of their minde.
God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, King of glorie giue them the Spirit of wisedome and reuelation through the confessing of thee, lighten their mindes that they may know, what the hope is wherevnto thou hast called vs; and how precious the glorie is of thine inheritance in the Saints, and how excellent the greatnes of his power is toward vs which beleeue according to the working of his mightie power, which thou hast wrought in him, when he was raised by thee from the dead, and placed at thy right hand in heauenlie places aboue al principalities and powers.
Open the harts of vnbeleuers, that hearing thy word they may acknowledge thee the onelie true God Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent; and may worship thee the Father in the Sonne, the Sonne in thee the Father with the holie Ghost, euen as thou hast reuealed thy selfe.
Take the vale from the harts of the Iewes least being blinded in the reading of the old Testament, they stumble at the stone and rock of offence by incredulitie, and hardnes of their harts, that thy Sonne Christ crucified and preached, be not vnto them a stumbling block, and thy Gospel the sauor of death vnto death but that being conuerted by true faith to the knowledge of thee the Father in the Sonne, their face being vncouered, they may behold thy glorie, knowing by the writings of the Prophets, the Messias, which thou hast appointed to be the Sauiour of the world.
Likewise gather thou the Gentils (to whom thy Gospel, the word of the crosse is meere foolishnes into thy Congregation that they may embrace thy mysterie, casting of al fleshlie wisedome, and leade al their cogitations captiue to the obedience of the Gospel.
Moreouer, our praier and supplication is, not onelie for those aboue mentioned, but also for such as, either, although they resist not thy truth, and pure religion openlie and obstinatelie, professe our religion, yet mingled with manie superstitions and abuses, worshipping and calling vpon Saints departed out of this life; or be addicted to outward ceremonies and rudiments of this world, burdening their consciences with mans obseruations, and traditions of their fathers or trusting to their owne righteousnes, or rather to the workes and deedes of the flesh, refuse and make little account of thy righteousnes which is the true iustification, and go about to establish their owne righteousnes.
But Christ is the ende of the Lawe for righteousnes to as manie as beleeue.
And, an other foundation can no man laie, than that is laide in thy Sonne the Messias, which is the waie, the truth, the life, and the ende of the Lawe.
For by his perfect obedience and fulfilling of the Lawe, by his innocent and bitter death, he hath restored vnto vs true saluation, and perfect righteousnes, that euerie one which beleeueth on him might not perish, but haue euerlasting life.
God, the sight of the blind, bring them home againe, which through ignorance either are entangled in doubtful labyrinthes, and grosse errors, or countenance polluted religion, that lightened by thy spirit, they may returne into the right waie.
And such as with impudent faces, and stiffe necks, do obstinatlie, with an affected ignorance withstande thine holie Spirit whose senses the God of this worlde hath blinded that the light of thy glorious Gospel shine not ouer them, represse, bridle their malice, that by slaughters persecutions they nether troble nor destroy thy Church, Amen.
Merciful, faithful, and louing God, rewarder of al good workes.
Forasmuch as ingratitude is the most odious detestable vice of al, the which both thou doest abhor, no wise man can abide, as a thing deseruing infinit paines and rigorous punishment.
For he which rendreth euil for good euil shal not depart from his house.
And the hope of the vnthankful shal melt away like the winter ice, and flow away as vnprofitable water.
We beseech thee giue vs grateful mindes alwaies remembring benefits receiued, least forgetting the merits exhibited vpon vs, we fal into the filthie and abhominable fault of ingratitude.
But gouerne vs with thine holie Spirit, that we may alwaies giue thanks vnto thee, a most bountiful God, for such benefits as thou hast bestowed, not vpon vs onelie, but vpon al mankind: For creating vs after thine owne image for redeeming vs being sinners forlorne, and condemned; for deliuering vs from sinne, death, and hel by the most holie and pretious blood of thy deere Sonne for bestowing thy righteousnes, thine holie Spirit, and euerlasting life vpon vs; for conseruing our soules, and bodies safe and sounde; finallie for giuing, and that abundantlie al such things as are necessarie for the sustentation of this life; and besides, for thy merciful protection against al dangers; al which thou doest of thy meere mercie and Fatherlie goodnes without any merits or worthines of ours.
And therefore we wil extol thee, God of our life, and yeeld thanks to thy Name, most hie.
For thou art gratious and thy mercie endureth for euer.
We wil giue thee thanks, Lord, among the people; we wil sing to thee among the nations.
For the greatnes of thy mercie reacheth vnto the heauens.
So infinite and great are thy benefits conferred vpon vs, Lord, that we are vnable to conceiue them in our minds.
Notwithstanding our mouthes shal speake of thy righteousnes and saluation for we know none end thereof.
What recompence shal we make to the Lord for al the benefits that he hath done vnto vs We wil take vp the cup of saluation, and cal vpon the Name of the Lord.
We wil pay our vowes vnto the Lord in the presence of his people.
We wil neuer forget thy benefits and woonderous works which thou hast done for vs.
To thee, God the Father, be thanks for al things in the name of our Lorde Iesus Christ.
Secondlie, we thinke it our bounden dutie to praie for our benefactors that haue begot, brought vp, taught, and promoted vs, that it woulde please thee to repaie them, and al other for whom am bounde to praie, whose necessities are knowen to thee.
These commende to thy mercie in our praiers, that thou maist blesse them both with temporal and euerlasting rewards.
celestial God, and most excellent recompencer thou hast power and mercie to render to euerie one according to their workes.
Do wel, Lorde, vnto those that be good and true of hart.
Vouchsafe to reward al our benefactors; let them receiue most plentiful benefits according to the multitude of thy mercies.
Shewe mercie vnto them, Lord, that haue comforted vs; and so blesse their families, that they may finde mercie with thy Sonne our Lord and Sauior Christ at that daie when we shal al appeere before his tribunal seate to giue an accompt of our works.
Sonne of the liuing God, which dost ascribe and impute the same to be done vnto thee which is extended vnto any of thy seruants; and dost promise a most liberal reward euen for a cup of cold water requite according to thy woonted goodnes, euerie one which haue extended the works of mercie, and the duties of humanitie vpon vs, that they may be blessed, and enriched mightilie with the encrease of good things.
He which hath consideration of the poore and needie let him be deliuered, Lord, in the euil daie; Keepe him, giue him life, make him blessed in the land, and giue him not vp to the wil of his enimies; but comfort him when he lieth sick in his bed, and in the daie of troble heare his praiers.
Let his almes be alwaie in thy sight and be mindful of him for euer, that when he falleth he may be vpholden.
Grant, Lord, that according to our habilities we may recompence benefits receiued; and shewe our selues grateful in deede, that our leaues wither not, neither that we So that al things, as it were, ouerburdened and wearied, doe grone, and trauel in paine together with thine elect, and desire a deliuerance from such and so great euils, whervnto they are subiect, and made to serue to vanitie at the lust of the wicked.
Vnto thee doe we crie from the bottome of our harts, Segregate vs, Lord, from the darknes, decept, and filthines of this world, and withdrawe vs from the desire of earthlie things, that being incorporated into thy congregation, where thy Diuinitie doth abide, we may seeke after heauenlie things, and forsake earthlie, which are fraile and transitorie.
righteous Father, the worlde doth not knowe thee but thy Sonne doth know thee, and they to whom thy Sonne doth reueale thee by thine holie Spirit.
Giue vs the same thy Spirit, that we may know what riches we haue receiued by Christ, and speake not the things which mans wisedome doth teach but which thy Spirit shal teach comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
Keepe vs in the confession of thy Name, that thou in vs maist be glorified, and that we fauor not of terrene and wordlie things but dwelling in minde in heauen, may seeke those things that are aboue and be made partakers of the diuine nature, and flie from the corruption, which is in the world: least in this miserable and dronken state therof, we enwrap our selues in worldlie cares, which withdraw our minds from the exercise of godlines, and choake the good motions of the holie Spirit.
Grant therefore that we loue neither the world nor the things in the world: but vsing this world, we may be as those which vse it not
Rule thou our harts that we giue not our selues to the pleasures of this world; neither enter into the broade waie, and wide gate which bringeth to eternal destruction: but shunning al the enticements of this world may go in at the narrow gate to the kingdome of heauen.
Christ our Redeemer, which hast chosen and seuered vs from this world, that, not imitating the same, we might be saued: giue grace that al which haue promised wholie to serue thee, which dost ouerthrow the prince of this world may be safe from al the assaults of the subtile spirit.
For it were a shameful and traitorous deed to promise wholie to be thy seruants, and yet to fauor thy mortal enimie, and to followe his workes.
But he that warreth laboreth to please him which hath chosen him to be a soldior.
Guide vs that we follow not the vading glorie of this world, neither delite therein.
For he which wil fauor the world is an enimie to God.
But let the world be crucified to vs and we to the world, through the denial of our selues, and renouncing al the enticements of the same.
Grant vs grace, that we may walke wiselie and circumspectlie in this present world, not as fooles and vnwise, but as wise: and shun al occasions of falling, and redeeme the time because the daies are euil.
God the holie Ghost, poure into vs thine heauenlie wisdom, which is from aboue that in spiritual matters we may cast off altogether the wisdome of the world, which is foolishnes with God in the simplicitie of mind cleaue vnto thy word.
Instruct vs, that hauing renounced vngodlines we may walke vprightlie and godlie in this worlde; looking for that blessed hope, and appearing of the glorie of the great God, and of our Sauior Iesus Christ, which gaue himselfe for vs to redeeme vs from al iniquitie, and to make vs a pure peculiar people vnto himselfe, zelous of good works
Comfort our minds, that our harts be not trobled when the worlde doth persecute vs.
For we are counted no better than the verie excrements, and ofcouring of this world.
And therefore make vs pacientlie to beare not onelie euerie miserie incident to al men: but also the peruerse and sinister iudgement of the world, the which also thou didst suffer for our sakes
Vphold vs in the mids of our afflictions, that both the world and the prince thereof may wel knowe, that thou hast a tender care ouer thy poore flock, wilt protect, and saue the same euerlastinglie, Amen.
WE thanke thee, King of heauen earth, for protecting vs this daie by thy strong hand, stretched out arme from al perils.
The right hande of the Lorde bringeth mightie things to passe; the right hand of the Lord hath exalted vs; the right hand of the Lord doth great things, it hath kept vs from al euil; the Lord hath saued our soules.
Therefore we wil be mindful of thee, Lord, vpon our beds, and waking wil we meditate of thy goodnes, because thou hast bin our helper vnder the shadow of thy wings wil we reioice.
Our soules cleaue vnto thee, because thy right hand hath vpholden vs, and saued vs in our extremities.
We wil be mindful of the time past wherein thou maruelouslie didst assist vs, and meditate of al thy deedes
We wil discourse of the workes of thine hands, and wil neuer forget thy mightines.
For thy mercie endureth for euer thou wilt not despise the workmanship of thine owne hands.
Now blesse the Lord al his seruants which stand in the house of the Lord in the courts of the house of our GOD; in the night lift vp your hands to his sanctuarie, and blesse the Lord.
The Lorde which made both heauen and earth, blesse vs from aboue.
Vnto thee, Lorde, doe we lift vp our hands, and beseech thee with al humblenes of minde, pardon al our sinnes, which this daie we haue committed either against thee, or our neighbors.
Our handes are defiled with blood and our fingers with much iniquitie.
Our transgressions are afore thee, and make answere against vs.
But doe not thou, Lorde, beholde the wickednes of thy people but remember thy couenant which thou hast made with vs in the blood of thy Sonne; neither consider thou our wicked enterprises, but haue in mind that thy testimonies are pure among vs, and thy worde vndefiled.
Thinke not vpon those that haue walked fainedlie before thee: but remember them which according to thy wil doe feare thee.
Neither doe thou destroie them which haue liued beastly: looke vpon them that not onelie teach, but obserue thy commandements.
Take thou none indignatio~ at them which are worse than beasts: but loue them alwaies that put their trust in thy righteousnes and glorie.
For we and our Fathers haue al the same sicknes: but because of vs sinners thou shalt be called merciful.
For if thou hast mercie on vs, thou shalt be called merciful to vs that haue no works of righteousnes.
And therefore be thou merciful vnto vs, Lord, for thy Name sake, and pardon al our transgressions, whereby most infinitelie we haue deserued thine euerlasting displeasure.
Let thine hand be readie to saue vs, that we may prefer thy commandements aboue al things, and fulfil them with our fingers.
Lord, in our troble doe we seeke thee; our hands in this night season are lifted vp to thee, Neither shal anie thing be in cause, but that in this darke and dreadful night, thou shalt lighten and illustrate euerie darke corner of our habitation, that our candels go not out by night.
When we sit in darknes bring vs into the light, saue vs from vtter darknes where is weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Thou art the God which giuest light to our candle, lighten therefore our darknes, our God, that we sleepe not in death.
And protect vs by the shadow of thine hand that none euil stick to vs this night.
Deliuer vs from the snare of the hunter and from the noisome pestilence.
Defende vs vnder thy wings, and vnder thy feathers we shal be safe.
Let thy truth compasse vs like a shield, that we be not afraid for any terror by night, nor yet either for the pestilence that walketh in darknes, or for the sicknes that destroieth at noone daie.
thousande shal fal beside vs, and ten thousand on our right hand, but it shal not come nigh vs. Lorde, deliuer vs out of the hands of our enimies and saue vs from such as persecute our soules: they imagine wickednes in their chambers, they sleepe not except they haue done mischiefe, and sleepe is taken from them vntil they haue done harme.
Lord, keepe vs, Lord, be thou our defence ouer our right hande, that the sun parch vs not by day nor the moone by night.
The Lord is our light and our saluation, whom then should wee feare? The Lord is the strength of our life, of whom then should we be afraide? Though an host of men were laide against vs; yet shal not our harts be afraid: and though the wicked should rise vp against vs to deuour our flesh; yet it shal be our comfort alwaie, that thou wilt hide vs in thy tabernacle in the euil day, and defende vs in the secret place of thy dwelling through Christ our Lord, Amen.
BLessed is the Lord God of Sabbaoth which by his commandement created the morning, and assigned to the daie spring his place, where arising euery daie it apprehendeth the wings of the earth, and speedilie runneth to the vttermost parts of the world.
Who is like our God which doth woonderous things both in heauen and earth? Lord, heauen is thy seat, and the earth is thy footestoole.
Vnto thee doe we bend our selues, yeelding most humble thankes for that it hath pleased thee of thy wonted goodnes to preserue vs this night vnder thy merciful protectio~.
Of thy clemencie hast thou deliuered our soules from the mids of Lions among whom we laie; with thy shielde of saluation hast thou compassed vs about, like as a shepherd watcheth, and looketh to his flock.
Wherefore we wil sing of thy power and praise thy mercie betimes in the morning.
For thou hast bin our defence and refuge in the daie of our troble.
We beseech thee euen for the bloodie sweate of thy Sonne our Lord and Sauior Christ, that thou wouldest vouchsafe this morning to moisten and mollifie our harts, through the grace of thine holie Spirit.
As the morning dew spreading it selfe earelie before daie doth wet, and fil the earth; and as the morning raine by drops doth water drie places, wherby they do fructifie and bring forth herbes and grasse: so extende thy grace toward vs and by thine heauenlie dewe besprinkle our hard and drie harts, that we may wholie delight in the waies of thy righteousnes, walke in the pathes of thy commandements.
Let thy liuing Spirit guide vs forth into the land of righteousnes.
Lorde, for thy Name sake quicken vs in thy righteousnes, that thy word may be a lanterne vnto our feete, and a light vnto our steps.
Shew vs thy waies Lord, and teach vs thy pathes.
Order our steps according to thy word, so shal no wickednes haue dominion ouer vs, neither shal we wander from the right waie.
Take from vs the waie of lieng and grant vs graciouslie thy lawe.
would to God our waies were directed to the keeping of thy statutes, that we might not walke in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the waie of sinners, nor sit in the seate of the scorneful, but delight in the lawe of the Lorde, and exercise our selues therein daie and night; then should we be as a tree planted by the riuers of waters, that bringeth forth hir frute in due season.
Lorde, in our trobles we wil seeke thee earelie in the morning, and returne vnto thee our GOD, which art readie as the spring of the daie, and wilt come vnto vs as the fructifieng raine and as the timelie and latter shoure which doth good to the earth: be thou in like maner a refuge vnto the poore, and a timelie helper in our troble.
We wil loue thee deerelie Lorde our strength: thou art our rock and our defence, our Sauior, our God, and our might in whom we wil trust, our buckler, the horne of our saluation and our refuge.
Keepe vs, Lord, from the hands of the vngodlie preserue vs from wicked men, which are purposed to ouerthrow our goings.
The proude haue laide a snare for vs, and spred a net abroad with cordes, yea, and set traps in our waie.
But deliuer thou our soules from death and our feete from falling.
For thou art righteous, Lorde, and dwellest in the middes of vs doing none iniquitie: but earelie, earelie euerie morning bringest thou forth thy iudgement into light, and wilt not be drawen awaie from sauing vs, that we be not hurt of bloodie felowes, of theeues murtherers, whose feete are swift to shed blood.
In thy Name, Christ, King of eternal glorie we wil tread vpon the Serpents and Scorpions ouer the whole power of the enimie, and he shal not hurt vs, for thy worde shal saue vs which liuest and rulest with the Father in the vnitie of the holie Spirit, a God for euermore, Amen.
WE thanke thee, Lord Iesu Christ God and man, for that of thine onlie and free mercie without any works or worthines at al of ours, thou hast redeemed vs and damned men through thy most innocent and holie passion.
sweete Iesu, how bitter and great were thy paines; how horrible and cruel thy punishment; how greuous and lamentable thine affliction; how bloodie thy wounds; thy dolors how diuers; and thy death how shameful, which thou sufferedst for vs? How inestimable was the loue, that mooued thee to endure such and so great torments to reconcile vs to the Father In the mount of Oliues through our infinite sinnes lighting vpon thee, and sense of the most heauie displeasure of thy Father against our wickednes, that didst sweate, contrarie to our common nature, blood, that the drops like blood trickled vpon the earth, so after a maruelous maner blood came out of thee being expelled through the resolution of the spirits, nature being broken and languishing by reason of thine intolerable sorrowes and torments.
And therefore, thy Disciples being fled thou didst voluntarilie commit thy selfe into the handes of the cruel Iewes, which brought thee most rigorouslie bounde without compassion from the presence of one corrupt Iustice vnto another more cruel: where thou being falselie accused, was vniustlie condemned, contemptuouslie spit vpon, opprobriouslie obraided, and buffeted most iniuriouslie.
For our offences thou wast wounded and for our wickednes broozed, for the offences of thy people thou wast beaten, killed, and with sharpe thornes crowned, and contumeliouslie dealt withal.
For our sinnes thou wast cruellie handled, a worme not a man: a verie scorne of men, and the outcast of the people.
Thy looke was odious, and il fauoured, a man thou wast ful of sorrowes without forme or beautie, so that they had no lust vnto thee.
Besides some couered thine eies and laide vpon thy face with their fists, exasperating thy torments with manie scoffes, and mockes.
Thy blessed bodie was so mangled, and cut with stripes, that euen an Ethnike pittieng the same, vttered these words, Behold the man.
Finallie, for our enormous offences, thou wast hanged, like an accursed wretch betweene two theeues; afflicted with a most odious kind of death pierced through the hands and the feete, whereby thou didst encounter with most extreeme torments; which were so great, that for a space, thou wast after a sort without al maner comfort and so constrained through thy great sorowe and greeuousnes of paine to drinke vineger so in the extremitie of paine thou didst giue vp thy Ghost, co~mending the same vnto thy deere Father in wonderful patience, like a sheepe lead to the slaughter and as a lambe quiet before the shearer: thou didst not open thy mouth to raile yea, that was so far from thee that thou praiedst for thine enimies that so by thy torments, hauing quited vs from al guilt aswel of fault as of punishment, we might be healed.
For to this ende didst thou be are the burden of our sinnes vpon the woode of the crosse that thou mightest recouer the peace of soules for such as are healed by thy stripes, and obteine the true righteousnes for as manie as beleeue on thee, that the wrath of thine eternal Father which is a consuming fire, doe not deuour vs. Iesu Christ, sonne of the liuing God, for these torments, al other thy passions, we wil honor, praise, and thanke thee for euermore, beseeching thee most humblie, that thy passions may worke and take effect in vs, and be a present most wholesome medicine in al necessities; and that alwaies being mindful of the same, we may reioice therein make it a comfort for our selues against al the tentations of Satan, and the force of sinne the Law: that thy crosse may be an ensample to vs that walking in thy steps, we render not rebuke for rebuke, but may imitate thy long suffering and praie for such as curse vs and finallie, may so thinke vpon, and celebrate the cause of thy death, that the consideration thereof may vtterlie both extinguish al the flames of vnlawful concupiscence, and burie the enticements of the flesh, and also raise vp the seede of godlines, and nourish the loue of virtue within vs, that so being wholie dead vnto sinne, we may liue vnto righteousnes, serue thee which barest our sinnes in thy bodie vpon the crosse, but liuest now and raignest with the Father in the vnitie of the holie Spirit, a God for euermore, Amen.
Lord God, which art+ful of compassion mercie, long suffering, and of great goodnes, thou continuest thy mercie for thousands taking awaie iniquitie, sinnes, and offences; thou callest vs after thy woonted mercie by thy worde to repentance, and hartie conuersion.
For vnto al, and euerie one is repentance and forgiuenes of sinnes preached in thy Name.
Moreouer, we knowe the riches of thy lenitie patience, and long suffering in this, that thou dost not suddainelie at vnawares take awaie sinners from the earth, neither ouerwhelme them by by, through thy iustice in their wicked deedes doing; but giuest them a space to repent: which is a most notable argument, that thou wilt not the death of a sinner but rather that he be conuerted, and liue.
For thou art merciful ouer al, because thou canst al and dissemblest the sinnes of men for their amendment.
Thou louest al things that are and abhorrest nothing which thou hast made, neither hast thou ordained any thing which thou doest hate, but sparest al, because they are thine, Lord, louer of our soules.
Therefore doe we certainlie beleeue that the promise of free reconciliation is vniuersal, and belongeth to al conuerted.
how good and pleasant is thy Spirit, Lord, in al things, therefore dost thou manie times punish such as go astraie, that being warned of their faults, they may depart from their wickednes and beleeue in thee: Thou callest offenders into the waie by affliction, and by iudgeing dost thou by little little giue place for amendment knowing fulwel what the generation and corruption of man is, and how it may be reduced.
thou masterer of power, with great moderation dost thou iudge mankind, and after this maner dost thou teach thy people, that they should be righteous, and hast made them children of a good hope
Moreouer, for a caution, and instruction to vs thou doest many waies scourge our enimies, that thereby we may consider of thy goodnes, also being iudged may trust in thy mercie.
Vnto thee, most merciful God, do we crie, which knowest the hardnes of our harts, that, through original sinne our harts being hardened, we haue no power of our selues to returne and rise vp: Conuert vs, Lord, and we shal be conuerted, because thou art our God, and being conuerted we wil doe penance.
Shew vs our offences, that striking our thighes we may be hartily sorie for our sinnes committed.
Heale vs, Lord, and we shal be whole; saue vs, and we shal be saued for thou art our praise.
Behold we are as a sheepe wandering, and readie to perish, seeke thy seruants, Lord, that we forget not thy commandements.
Circumcise the foreskin of our vnderstanding, that our harts be not hardened.
Iesu Christ, looke vpon vs with thine eies of pittie; euen as thou lookedst back vpon the sinful woman in the banket, which prostrating hirselfe at thy feete, bitterly did bewaile hir wickednes.
Likewise fauor vs as thou didst the Publican standing a far of in the Temple without lifting vp his eies vnto heauen for shame, but striking his brest onelie saide, Lord be merciful vnto me a sinner.
Grant that among the feares and terrors of conscience we may take hold of thee by a liuely faith (which hast redeemed vs from the curse of the Lawe and art made for vs wisedome and righteousnes, and sanctification, and redemption) and may not, in the fight of conscience, yeeld our selues, and dispaire, but vpholden by the voice of the Gospel may flie vnto thee our Mediator, and iustified by faith may haue peace with God.
Restore also in vs the right of thy lawe, so that from our harts we may obeie thee our Redeemer, walking in newnes of life
Thou which hast suffered for vs in the flesh giue vs grace that likewise in the same minde we may be armed for the mortification of the flesh, that henceforth we liue, not after the lustes of men, but after the wil of God.
For it is sufficient for vs that we haue spent the time that is past of the life after the wil of the Gentils, walking in wantonnes, lusts, in excesse of wynes, in excesse of eating, in excesse of drinking, and abominable Idolatries.
Mollifie our harts that they may repent, and esteeme greatlie of the riches of thy goodnes.
Moreouer, represse hypocrites, which flatter their affections and extenuate the inner euils sticking in our nature, and iudge falselie of thy lawe, not knowing that the lawe is spiritual accusing euen our inclination to be euil.
Keepe the Diuel vnder that he compel not the trobled consciences of some to desperation, either by heaping, and reaping vp their offences, or extenuating thy mercie: but grant that al sinners may come vnto thee by hearing thy worde to repentance that the Angels in heauen may continuallie haue occasion to reioice, Amen.
Omnipotent and eternal God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, which art the comfort of the afflicted, the ioie of the trobled, of the forlorne the stay, and our refuge in the time of troble, the God of patience and consolation: Thou knowest the weakenes of our flesh, that we are by nature feareful, of no courage, so that in crosses and calamities we are not able to stand of our owne strength.
Wherefore vnfaine dlie, and from the hart we crie vnto thee, Keepe vs vnder miseries and crosses in faith sound stedfast in hope, and in patience constant, that with quiet mindes, and a valiant courage we may suffer al iniuries and aduersitie; and neuer, being broken with sorow attempt that which is contrarie to thy commandements, but by acknowledging thy wil, may beare al sortes of calamities with calling for thine assistance
Poure into vs godlie cogitations, so that we imagine not, that the miseries and afflictions in this worlde, light vpon vs by chance, against thy wil: but that the Church is gouerned by thy prouidence, and without thy permission that none euil (of punishment) commeth, but thou sendest the same.
Gouerne thou our minds, that we imagine at no time thee to be our enimie, when we are pinched with aduersitie: but may beleeue that we are chastined of thy good and fatherlie purpose for the remnants of sinne abiding in this corrupted nature of ours, thereby to be stirred vp, and confirmed in the exercises of contrition, faith, confession, patience, and other like virtues.
Certes it is to be accounted for an exceeding benefit that thou sufferest not sinners to followe their owne minds but thou withdrawest them by punishment from their impietie, least that liuing after their owne minds, and doing al things as they list, they perish in their wickednes: And therefore doest not thou wink alwaies at our sinnes, GOD, as thou dost at the offences of other nations, which thou sufferest to fil the measure of their iniquities, that so afterward at the ripenes of their offences thou maist be reuenged vpon them, and destroie them vtterlie in the daie of iudgement, and of reuengement: But our iniquities thou dost visite by by with the rod of correction, and our wickednes with the whip of affliction.
Notwithstanding thou wilt not vtterlie take awaie thy mercie from vs. Though thou punishest with aduersitie: yet dost thou not forsake thy people.
Furthermore it is expedient that our coltish flesh be humbled, and brought vnder, and kept in awe.
For otherwise hauing the head it wil waxe ouerlustie, and cast of the yoke of the Lorde, being of it selfe slowe, our life fraile, and prosperitie wearieng our minds, and making euen the wisest, and most godlie many times sluggish and headdie.
But the trobled soule is nigh vnto thee in the crosse, and praier is then most effectual, when it is exercised in affliction.
For the minde vtterlie destitute of al other helpe of second causes wherevnto it woulde easilie cleaue, then doth open it selfe before thee, and wholie dependeth vpon thee, not trusting in it selfe, but altogether in thee, God, which raisest the dead to life: and so our faith is founde more precious than any gold that perisheth to the praise, and glorie of thy Name.
Finallie it behooueth vs at the length to be conformed like the bodie of Christ in his passion, that suffering with him we may also raigne together with him as his felowe heires.
For vnles we be wearie of this life, we shal not easelie aspire to our celestial countrie.
For which cause it is thy wil that by many tribulations we must enter into the kingdome of heauen.
Wherefore we beseech thee giue vs godlie minds, that we wonder not when we are tried by the fire, as though a strange thing did happen vnto vs, but rather let vs reioice, that we are partakers of the afflictions of Christ, that when his glorie appeareth we may be merie and glad.
Assist vs, that through patience we may runne to the battel that is before vs looking vnto Iesus the Captaine, and finisher of our faith, who for the ioie that was set before him, endured the most shameful crosse: Let vs beare in minde that he endured such speaking against him of sinners, that we should not be weried and faint in our minds: but strengthened with al might through thy glorious power vnto al patience and suffering, to continue vnmooueable in al tentations, neuer casting awaie our confidence which hath a great recompence appointed.
For we haue neede of patience, that after we haue done the wil of God, we may receiue the promise.
For yet a litle while and he that shal come, wil come, and wil not tarie.
blessed God, and Father of our Lorde Iesu Christ which art the Father of mercie, and God of al consolation, comfort vs in al our afflictions, that as the afflictions of Christ doe abound with vs, so with al by him our consolation may abounde, Amen.
Most wise God, eternal Father of thy beloued sonne our Lord and Sauior Christ, Creator, and keeper of al thy creatures, which through thine excellent wisedome, counsaile, hast enioined to womankind, that in paine and sorow they should bring forth children whereby not onelie this world is replenished, but a Church, which doth celebrate thy Name for euer, is gathered vnto thee: And forasmuch as the paine of a woman in trauel is most extreeme which makes the Prophets many times to repeate the same in exaggerating the afflictions of punishment which the holie Spirit doth threaten vnto the impenitent: We beseech thee in the Name of Christ thy Sonne, be merciful vnto al women either with child, or in childbed: giue them grace to cal into minde the decree and pleasure of thine heauenlie wil: let them neuer striue against thee through impatience, but in true faith and inuocation of thy Name suffer thy crosse quietlie, knowing that by the seede of the woman, which hath broken the old serpents head they are reconciled vnto thee: In this seede, which is Christ, the curse is cleane taken awaie and blessing restored to vs, that we may receiue the promise of the Spirit, and the inheritance of eternal life.
Almightie God, conuert now the sorowes of women in trauel into gladnes, that they remember not their paines with mourning, for ioie that a man childe is borne into the world
Comfort them in the middes of their anguish, and helpe aswel the mother as the babe, especialie in the danger of deliuerance
If thou blessed God, be not present, they perish vndoubtedlie, al the worlde cannot helpe them in that extremitie.
eternal God, which of the seed of man framest the liuing infant in the mothers wombe and nourishest the same congealed in blood, that the flesh within the time of ten monethes may take shape, drawing nourishment from the mother; we are al the workmanship of thine handes.
We giue thee thankes, Lord: for fearefullie wonderfullie are we made: maruelous are thy workes, and that our soules knowe right wel.
Our bones are not hid from thee, though we were secretlie made, neither our substance in the inner parts of our mothers wombe.
Thine eies did see our substance being vnperfect, and in thy booke were al our members written.
Thy hands haue made vs and facioned vs altogether: with skin and bones hast thou couered vs, and ioined vs together with bones and sinewes; thou hast giuen vs life and grace, and thy visitation hath preserued our spirits.
Grant, we beseech thee, to al infants yet vnborne, that knit together with their due vaines and members, they may come forth into this worlde sounde and perfect without fault or deformitie.
Staie the furiousnes of wicked spirits, that they shewe not their tyrannie vpon yong infants.
Keepe al with child, that, no waie being terrefied, or trobled extreemelie, they be vntimelie deliuered.
Giue grace also to the babes newlie borne, that, together with their outward baptisme, they may be receiued into the congregation of the faithful, with wholesome water through the renuing and regeneration of the holie Spirit which thou wilt plenteouslie poure vpon them, through Iesus Christ our Sauior; that being iustified by grace, they may be made heires according to the hope of eternal life, and become new creatures through him.
Strengthen al women deliuered, that being restored to their woonted health, they may glorifie thee their helper in the time of neede learne afterward to repose their whole confidence in thee, which art nigh vnto al that cal vpon thee to al, we saie, calling vpon thee in truth.
And if at any time through thine vnsearchable iudgement, an vntimelie birth, or (if, without offending thy godhead, we may saie) vnluckie deliuerance happen: so comfort, merciful GOD, the mourneful sad parents, that they faint not with sorow, but beleeue rather that the woful chance is a trial of their faith hope, and patience.
For thou art a merciful, and gratious God, forgiuing our sinnes.
Though thou art angrie with our wickednes: yet in thy displeasure thou remembrest thy mercie, that the trobled may take comfort and the afflicted finde grace.
For thus doe al thy seruants perswade themselues, that, if they be tried they shal be crowned; if they be trobled, they shal be deliuered; and if they be chastened, they shal be saued.
For thou hast no pleasure in our damnation, which bringest faire weather after stormes, and gladnes after teares.
Lorde our gouernor, thou hast prepared thy seate in the heauens thy kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome, and thy dominion endureth throughout al ages.
In thine hande is strength and auctoritie: none can resist thy power.
We beseech thee, be merciful vnto al in captiuitie, and oppressed with most greeuous slauerie; especiallie vnto such, as for the confession of thy Gospel, doe suffer persecution, banishment, imprisonment, perils of life, of good name, and of goodes: comfort them with thy Spirit, deliuer them from cruel bondes by thy diuine power, and grant such lawful meanes according to thy wisedome that thy faithful may be deliuered.
Lorde, bring home thy captiues exiled for thy Name sake that they may confesse thee, and extol thy goodnes.
that God woulde heare the mournings of the imprisoned and deliuer the sonnes appointed vnto death.
that God would bring home the captiuitie of his people: then should we be like such as dreame and our mouthes shoulde be filled with laughter, and our tong with ioie.
Then should they saie among the Gentils, The Lord hath done great things for them; yea, the Lord hath dealt maruelouslie with vs, we are made iocond.
Turne our captiuitie, Lord, as the riuers in the South.
For thou alone art our assister of whom commeth saluation thou deliuerest such as are bounde by thy power, and despisest not the groanings of the afflicted.
Praised be God continuallie which helpeth vs, and poureth out his benefits vpon vs, which letteth loose his captiues, and that without gifts or rewarde freelie for his holie Name sake.
Therefore shal the people worship thee, Lord, and praie vnto thee: for thou saiest vnto the bound, Come out; and to those that sit in darknes, Come to light.
Lord, cal into minde thy manifold mercies; deale with vs according to thy woonted goodnes, and giue not thine inheritance into the hands of thine enimies, least they make sale of vs, and spoile our lande.
Forgiue our sinnes, and transgressions; let not aliens haue dominion ouer vs neither let our houses passe vnto strangers; let vs not be as exiles, and pupils without a Father; neither our mothers, as widowes without husbands; let not our old men be wanting in our ports, nor yet our cou~trie lament for the waste which the enimie would make.
Heale the sorrowes of the daughter of thy people, and be merciful to our sinnes, for the glorie of thy Name sake.
Breake thou the chaines of the imprisoned, and deliuer such as are bound with manacles and fetters; cast of their yoke that they may praise thee for euer.
Bring them out of darknes and the shadow of death; Breake the gates of brasse, and smite the bars of iron in sunder, that they may know that thou art their Lorde, when thou hast broken the bonds of their yoke and deliuered them out of the hands of those that serued themselues.
But if it be thy wil for the trial of their faith and pacience to detaine some in exile and seruitude a longer time: then comfort such with thy spirit, and mitigate their paines, that they may finde fauor in the sight of them whom they are compelled to serue, and cast not them of for euer.
Aboue al, keepe them in the confession of true faith, and Christian religion, against al false worshippings, that so they may comfort themselues with the gratious pardoning of their sinnes through Christ, and their harts may be sealed with the earnest of the holie Spirit bearing witnes to their spirits that they are deliuered from perpetual captiuitie and bondage of hel.
Christ our Redeemer, deliuer our soules from the chaines of darknes, and snares of death, which sufferedst thy selfe to be bound, that thou mightest vnloose the most hard bands and knots of our transgressions: and wast sent of thine eternal Father into this world to preach libertie vnto captiues and deliuerance to such as are shut vp: Grant, that being entangled with the cordes of iniquitie, we giue not our members as weapons of vnrighteousnes vnto sinne
Breake in peeces the chaines of Satan, and turne vs into thy flock, that none vnrighteousnes haue dominion ouer vs. Deliuer him that is in bondage vnto Satan, and bring forth the bound by the blood of thy couenant out of the pit wherein is no water that he· spoile and kil vs not.
Giue grace also, that being snarled with humane traditions we entrap not our consciences by false opinions: but may serue thee our true God in Christian libertie, and neuer abuse the same to the offence of any.
Take vs miserable men out of the bodie of this death which maketh vs captiues to the lawe of sinne, which is in our members, that deliuered from sinne and death we may serue thee in true vprightnes and euerlasting life, which raignest for euer one God in the trinitie of persons, Amen.
Merciful God, we miserable men acknowledge confesse that in vs that is in our flesh there dwelleth no good thing.
But in sinne we were borne and our mothers conceaued vs of corrupt seede.
For our nature is defiled, and prone vnto al wickednes euen from our youth so that by the strength of our proper reason we cannot sauor those thinges which belong to the Spirit.
For the natural man speaketh, and fauoreth of earthlie things, and of himselfe is not meete so much as to thinke anie thing that good is without the assistance of thy power: Vnto thee doe we crie with our whole harts, that it woulde please thee to open vnto vs by thy Spirit the true knowledge of thine essence and wil, as thou hast reuealed thy selfe in thy worde, that we may not folow the sence of our flesh in iudging of spiritual things; neither by our blinde baiardlie reason, measure thine heauenlie saiengs.
For blood and flesh perceiue not the things which belong to the Spirit, and the fleshlie mind is enmitie against God for it is not obedient vnto the Lawe, neither can be.
And they which are in the flesh cannot please God.
Seing therefore that in vs abideth the seede of sinne, which is concupiscence; and a proanes vnto wickednes is ingraffed into vs by nature, yea, and original sin through our first parents, doth oftentimes prick vs vnto impietie.
For euerie one is tempted when he is drawen awaie, and enticed with the baite of his owne concupiscence, then when lust hath conceaued it bringeth forth sinne, and sinne when it is furnished, bringeth forth death: Giue vs grace that we folow not the concupiscence of our flesh, neither prouoke our sences by vnbrideled libertie, but stoutlie to resist them.
For vnles that wicked concupiscence be driuen from our mindes it wil neuer cesse til it haue brought forth deadlie sinne.
Wherefore assist vs that we may tame these bodies of ours, bring them into subiection least our flesh being ouerlustie doe offende, and ouerpasse the prescribed limits.
Assist vs, we beseech thee, to crucifie our flesh with al the affections and desires thereof, for the better seruing thee, and walking in the Spirit.
For we are debtors not to the flesh, to liue after the flesh, but, the deedes of the flesh being mortified, to liue renued after the holie Spirit in righteousnes and true holines.
Sanctifie vs holie Father, that we defile not our selues with carnal vices, with riotousnes, bellicheere; nor by vnlawful pleasure, casting of thine holie Spirit, that we make our bodies the houses of filthie feends, which carie awaie, and cast headlong al intemperate and secure persons into euerlasting destruction.
Be it far from vs, that we make our members the members of harlots whereby thy holie Spirit is banished, and man becommeth a denne for theeues, and a sink of filthines.
Gouerne vs, that we may shun the works of the flesh and be careful to doe the works of the Spirit as thy chosen seruants.
And forasmuch as the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit contrarie to the flesh (for they are contrarie, and continuallie striue together): be thou merciful vnto vs, God, helpe vs with thy diuine power, that the holie Spirit (which thou didst poure into vs at our baptisme) may beare the rule in our members, and preuaile ouer the flesh, and al the affections of the same.
Extinguish the flames of carnal desires, and represse our raging lustes: so shal we auoide enormous offences, and shun the wicked actions of our owne inuentions.
And if at any time, being subdued by flesh and blood, we shal wander from the path, and direction of the Spirit to something vnseemelie for our calling, impute not, we praie thee, that fault vnto vs, but remember that we are flesh, and conuert vs by thy diuine power.
And seeing that flesh of itselfe is vnbridelie, and wilde, not abiding correction, but is like a fat wanton calfe which is not vsed to labor: put thy yoke vpon vs, tame our flesh by thy Spirit, that walking soberlie and modestlie we may bridle the same, and humble it vnder thy commandements by withdrawing of delicious fare.
For with ouermuch fine fare our mindes waxe wanton and ouerlustie.
Aide vs, that by temperance, moderation, abstinence from superfluous meats drinks, we may bind our flesh to the direction of the holie Spirit, and mortifie our bodies of sinne: so shal we praise and magnifie thy Name, which liuest in vs worlds without ende, Amen.
WE wil praise thee, eternal God, Father of our Lorde IESV Christ, for maruelous things hast thou done for vs; thou hast deliuered our soules from death, and our feete from falling
Blessed be God which hath heard our praiers and brought vs out of the lake of miserie, out of the myre and claie: which set our feete vpon the rock, and ordered our goings, which hath saued vs this daie from al perils, and comforted our soules.
Wherefore we wil extol thee, and celebrate thy Name euerie daie; and at night wil we talke of thy righteousnes.
We wil magnifie the Lord our God, and bow our selues at his footestoole for he is holie.
We wil praise thee, Lord, because thou hast set vs vp and hast not made our foes to triumph ouer vs. Thou hast brought our soules from hel, and saued our liues from them that go downe into the pit.
Wherefore we wil sing praises vnto thee, and yeelde thee thanks, for a remembrance of thy holines.
most louing Father, here prostrating our selues before thy feete, we beseech thee in the Name of thy Sonne, who suffered for vs a most cruel death, blot out al our transgressions, whereby we haue offended thy Maiestie, and especiallie those which this day we haue committed.
For greatlie haue we sinned and our offences are mo than the sande of the sea.
We haue prouoked thee vnto anger, and done euil in thy sight.
But now we bend the knees of our hart, requiring thy mercie.
Lord, we haue sinned, we acknowledge our sinnes with griefe and sorow.
Pardon, pardon our sinnes, and destroie vs not together with our iniquities, neither reserue euil for vs for euer: but of thine infinit goodnes saue vs miserable and most vnworthie men.
For thou, Lord, according to thy wonted mercie hast promised forgiuenes of sinnes to al repenters.
Therefore we wil praise thee continuallie al the daies of our life; al the host of heauen praise thee worldes without end.
Who is such a God as thou that pardonest wickednes, and forgiuest the offences of the remnant of thine heritage? Thou keepest not thy wrath for euer, for thy delight is in mercie.
Thou turnest againe, and art merciful vnto vs; thou puttest downe our wickednes, castest al our sinnes into the bottome of the sea.
In this euening now the Sunne is gone, we praie thee, God, depart not from vs, which art the Sunne of righteousnes, neither let thine aide be far from vs, but abide with vs, Lord, for it draweth toward night, and the daie is far spent
Forsake vs not, Lord our God neither depart from vs; for tribulation is at hand and there is none to helpe.
GOD of our saluation, make haste to helpe vs, haue a regard to our defence, redeeme our soules in peace from those that war against vs. Deliuer vs from such as marke our goings.
Plucke our feete out of the snare, and leade vs in the path of righteousnes, that our feete slip not, and we take a fal.
Guide vs by thy wisedome, that when we walke it may leade vs when we sleepe it may keepe our feete, and when we wake we may talke thereof.
And therefore sleeping we wil not feare, but rest quietlie, and our sleepe shal be sweete; we wil not quake at the sudden terror, neither at the ranging of the vngodly when it happeneth.
The Lord shal be on our side, and protect our feete that we be not taken, yea, the Lord shal be our light, and saluation in darknes.
He is our hope which hath appointed vs so high a refuge.
Let none euil come vnto vs, neither suffer the whip to be nigh our tabernacle.
Lord be thou our watchman and protector that trobles vaine cogitations doe not inuade vs, and neither the feare of death ouerwhelme vs nor the sleepe of night alter our thoughtes, and vnderstanding when we should take our rest, and ease in our chambers, but grant vs a good quiet sleepe, and after the same to rise vp in the morning and to render due thanks and praise to thee our most merciful protector.
For our helpe is from the Lord which hath made both heauen and earth.
He wil not suffer our feete to be mooued: and he that keepeth Israël wil not sleepe, to whom be praise now, and euermore, Amen.
Lord God maker of al things, which art feareful and strong, and righteous, and merciful, which art onelie a gratious King, onelie liberal, onelie iust, almightie, and euerlasting; which deliuerest vs from al trobles both by daie and night, which hast made vs thy chosen through the blood of thy Sonne our Lorde and Sauior Christ which was shed for vs, and hast sanctified vs by thy Spirit giuen into our hartes, that wee should be a chosen generation a roial priesthood, to offer acceptable sacrifices vnto thee: Receiue now the sacrifice of praise from our mouthes for thy benefites conferred vpon vs.
We thanke thee, eternal God, not onlie for keeping vs this night passed, but also for defending vs this whole weeke, yea, and al our life time from the snares of wicked spirits, that they could not circumuent, and ouerthrow vs.
We wil praise thee, Lord with our whole hart we wil speake of al thy maruelous works; we wil be glad and reioice in thee.
Our songs wil we make of thy Name, thou most Hie, which exaltest vs from the gates of death, that we may declare al thy praises in the portes of thy Churches, we wil exceedinglie reioice in thy saluation.
Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel because he hath visited and redeemed his people; And hath raised vp an horne of saluation vnto vs, and deliuered vs from our enimies, and from the hande of al that hate vs.
He hath bin merciful vnto vs, in lightening those which sat in darknes and in the shadow of death to direct our feete into the waie of peace.
To thee doe we offer the sacrifice of praise that is the frute of lips confessing thy Name.
Our mouthes shal praise thee, Lord, and our tongues declare thy righteousnes.
Lo, we wil not refraine our lips, Lord, that thou knowest yea, we wil lift vp our hands vnto thy sanctuarie, and with our feete wil we hasten towards thine house, and in thy Congregation we wil praise thee.
We wil magnifie thee, God our King and will blesse thy Name for euer and euer.
Euerie daie wil we giue thankes vnto thee, and praise thy Name perpetuallie.
For great art thou, Lord, and maruelous worthie to be praised, there is none ende of thy greatnes.
Al generations shal extol thy workes, and speake of thy power: they shal talke of thy worship, glorie, praise and wonderous workes, and we wil declare thy mightines.
The memorial of thine abundant kindnes shal be shewed, and men shal sing of thy righteousnes.
The Lord is gratious and merciful, long suffering, and of great goodnes.
The Lord is louing vnto euerie man, and his mercie is ouer al his works.
Al thy works praise thee, Lord, and thy Saints giue thanks vnto thee from one generation to another.
God, earelie now this morning doe we cal for thine vnspeakeable mercie, beseeching thee from the bottome of our hart, that this morning thou wilt lighten our minds, so that the shining brightnes of thy knowledge may rise in vs, which are called out of darknes into the maruelous light of thy glorie, that, being awaked out of sleepe we may giue our selues to the works of light, and walke honestlie, as in the daie, not in rioting and dronkennes, neither in chambering and wantonnes, neither in strife, and enuieng.
For we beleeuers are the children of light and of the daie, not of night, and of darknes.
Therefore giue vs grace, that we sleepe not, as others doe, but make vs to watch, and be sober, putting on the brestplate of faith and charitie, and for an helmet to take the hope of saluation.
For thou God hast not ordeined vs to wrath, but to obteine saluation through our Lorde Iesus Christ which died for vs. Giue vs grace likewise, we beseech thee, that we abuse not this daie and other thy creatures vnto vanitie, neither giue our members as instruments vnto sinne, by doing such deedes as fight against the soule wounde the conscience, and greeue the same.
Succour vs, gratious God, that painefullie we may shunne and auoide sixe things which thou doest hate yea, seauen which thy soule doth abhor, to wit, a proude looke, a lieng tong, hands that shed innocent blood, an hart that goeth about wicked imaginations, feete that be swift in running to mischiefe, a false witnes which bringeth forth lies; and him that soweth discord among brethren.
Lord, God of our saluation, into thine hands wil we deliuer our harts, that earelie they may watch to thee our maker and in thy sight wil we praie that thou maist protect vs in the daie of troble.
In sixe calamities deliuer vs, Lord, and in the seuenth let none euil come to vs; in famine saue vs from death; in battel fro~ the power of the sworde; hide vs from the scourge of the tong; when destruction commeth let vs not feare; in dearth make vs merie; and let not the beasts of the earth apale our courage.
Grant this, Father, for thy deere Sonne our Sauior Christs sake, Amen.
Most holie Trinitie, which art the true eternal Vnitie, of equal glorie and maiesty, we worship thee, we praise thee, we thanke thee for al thy benefits, as it is truelie meete, iust, and good for vs alwaies to giue thanks vnto thee.
Lord most holie, eternal God, and Almightie Father through Christ our Lorde, by whom Angels praise thee, Kings adore thee, and powers doe feare thee: the heauens, and heauen of heauens, yea the blessed Seraphins with ioie together doe magnifie thee, saieng with humble confession, Holie, Holie, Holie, Lord God of Sabaorh, the whole earth is ful of thy glorie.
Especiallie at this time, Father most Hie, we thanke thee for thy mercie abunding toward vs, which of thy great loue wherewith thou louedst vs, yea, when we were dead through sinne, didst quicken vs together with Christ, and being raised with him hast made vs to sit together in heauenlie things, thereby to shew to al ages hereafter the exceeding riches of thy grace in thy kindnes toward vs through Iesus Christ.
For by grace are we saued through faith, and that not of our selues, it is the gift of God, not of workes, least anie man should boast.
Besides, thou hast by thine holie Spirit sealed and prepared vs vnto good workes which thou didst before ordeine that we might walke in them, and please thee in newe obedience.
We wil declare the goodnes of the Lord yea, and praise the Lord for al that he hath giuen vs. Great is thy mercie, Lord, and thy goodnes incomparable toward vs. Who shal be able to expresse thy workes? or who can seeke out the grounde of thy noble actes who shal declare the power of thy greatnes? or take vpon him to tel out thy mercie? which is such, and so infinite, that it can neither be augmented, nor diminished.
For looke how hie the Heauen is in comparison of the earth: so great is thy mercie also towardes them which feare thee.
And as far as the East is from the West: so far hast thou set our sinnes from vs.
For as a Father pittieth his owne children: euen so art thou merciful to al which feare thee.
Yea, though a Mother doe forget hir infant and take no pittie on the sonne of hir wombe, yet wilt not thou forget vs; for we are written vpon thine hands.
The mercie of the Lord is vnchangeable, infinite, and neuer faileth but dailie ariseth newe and fresh vpon vs.
The merciful goodnes of the Lord endureth for euer and euer vpon them which feare him, his righteousnes vpon childers children, such as keepe his couenants, and thinke vpon his commandements to doe them.
Thy mercie is on such as feare thee from generation to generation.
The mercie that a man hath reacheth vnto his neighbor, but the mercie of the Lorde is vpon al flesh, chastening, and teaching, and nurturing: yea, euen as a shepheard turneth againe his flock, so doth he al them which receiue chastening, nurture, and doctrine.
Merciful art thou vnto al them which receiue correction, and diligentlie seeke after thy iudgements.
And although for a while thou forsakest vs yet afterward in much fauor wilt thou gather vs together.
In the time of thy wrath thou hidest thy face from vs for a little season, but for al that thy mercie towarde vs is euerlasting.
Blessed be thy Name, God of our Fathers, which when thou art angrie shewest mercie, and in the time of troble forgiuest the sinnes of them which cal vpon thee.
This thy goodnes and ouerabounding mercie, which hath bin from the beginning and for euer shal continue ouer al which vnfainedlie repent; neuer languishing or failing but abiding perfect alwaies in the highest degree, we wil praise and confesse from one generation to another.
For gratious and merciful is the Lord, patient, and long suffering bent to shew fauor, and meruelouslie gentle towards al that cal vpon him.
Praise the Lord al ye heathen and glorifie him al nations.
For his merciful kindnes is euer more and more toward vs.
We wil not keepe back thy louing mercie and truth from the great congregation withdraw not thou thy mercies from vs, Lorde; let thy kindnes and truth alwaie preserue vs. let thy merciful kindnes be our comfort according to thy worde vnto thy seruants.
deale with thy seruants according to thy great mercie and teach vs thy statutes, that in like maner we may be merciful toward al men without respect of persons, or hope of gaine, willinglie without morositie: that in thy iudgement we may finde mercie through the passion and death of thy sonne Iesus Christ, which liueth raigneth with thee in the vnitie of the holie Spirit a God worlds without ende, Amen.
Most gratious God, thy yeares endure throughout al generations thy daies are without ende or beginning: but the daies of man surelie are determined which he can not ouerpasse and the nomber of his moneths are knowen to thee, thou hast appointed him his bounds which he cannot go beyonde.
Thou hast nombred our daies, which vade awaie sodainelie like the grasse
Our daies are like a shadowe, and wither awaie like grasse.
man in this world is euen like a vapor that vanisheth awaie
For al flesh is grasse, and al the glorie thereof, as the flower of the fielde, which florisheth in the morning and afterwarde withereth and vadeth.
Behold our daies are to be measured, they are as it were a spanne long, and our age is nothing in respect of thee.
Our age is folden together, and taken awaie from vs like a shepherdes cotage our life is cut of by our sinnes, like the thred of the weauer, which is sodainlie broke of.
are but strangers in this wode and soiourners, as were our fathers: our daies on the earth also are but as a shadow, and we are as nothing in respect of thee.
Our life speedilie goeth awaie like the weauers shuttle, and it abideth not.
Wherefore, Lord, let vs know our end and the number of our daies, that we may be certified how long we haue to liue, and what is yet to come.
Instruct vs, Lord, that, being alwaies mindful of our mortalitie we neuer promise to our selues manie yeeres, nor long liues in this pilgrimage of ours, so shal we not liue securelie deferring our conuersion to thee from daie to daie, nor yet put confidence in this fraile and vncertaine life, as did that rich man, saieng Soule, thou hast much good laid vp in store for manie yeeres, take thine ease, eate, drinke, and be merie: Whose soule notwithstanding was taken from him the same night.
But giue grace, that in thy feare we may dailie prepare selues to depart out of this prison.
for nothing is more certaine than death, though nothing more vncertaine than the houre thereof.
Therefore let vs haue alwaies before our eies an image, and meditation of our departure, the better to know the fleeting and vanitie of this combersome and vncertaine life, that we may liue to thee our God, being sounde in faith and strong in hope, loking with cherefulnes for the daie of our departure, the ioiful appearing of thy Sonne Iesus Christ our Redeeemer: and as long as we abide in this tabernacle of our bodies with al studie ministering to our faith, virtue; to virtue, knowledge; to knowledge, temperance; to temperance, patience; to patience, godlines: vntil this tabernacle being laid awaie, we shal passe ouer to our dwelling place, not made with hande, but euerlasting in the heauens, where we shal be clothed with eternal glorie immortalitie, when this earthlie house is put of, and destroied.
Grant also that trusting firmelie to thy promises, we may be readie and glad to returne to our euerlasting and celestial country: for while we are in this bodie, we wander fro~ thee our God, for now we walke in faith, not in the enioieng and possession of eternal goodes: wherfore, whether we be at home, or from home, let vs endeuor our selues to be acceptable in thy sight.
Make vs faithful and wise seruants alwaies loking for the comming of our Lord (for we know not when he wil come, at the euening, or at midnight, whether at the cock crowing, or in the dawning) least by a suddaine houre of death being ouertaken, and as it were caught in the foulers trap we be found vnreadie: but contrariwise by prudent watching in true conuersion and repentance may continuallie couet to be dissolued and to be with Christ our Redeemer.
Grant also, that at the point of death, hauing escaped al hardnes and tentations, we may triumph like conquerours, and beholde the presence and power of thine holie Spirit; let our last words be that, which thy Sonne did vtter vpon the altar of the Crosse, saieng Father into thine hands commende my spirit: when our speech is taken from vs, heare, God, the groanings of our harts.
And the houre of death being come, let thy seruants depart in peace, because our eies haue seene thy saluation, which thou hast prepared before the face of al people: a light to be reuealed vnto the Gentiles, and the glorie of thy people Israël, through our Lorde Iesus Christ, Amen.
OMnipotent, and eternal Father, which hast giuen to thy Church certaine promises of corporal things: we thy children crie vnto thee for our dailie bread, and else what pertaining to the sustentation of our mortal bodies.
Make our fieldes fertile, that the seede sowen may come vp, and our ground yeelde vs a ioieful haruest.
Prosper thou the labors of al artificers, and let their doings take good successe.
Blesse, Lorde, the workes of our hands, our heardes of cattel and flocks of sheepe, that they may prosper, and encrease, and we feele no barennes, desolation, nor decaie.
For it is the blessing of God that maketh rich, and causeth plentie.
Except the Lord build the house their labour is but lost that build it.
It is but vaine for vs to rise earlie, and late to take rest, eating the bread of sorowe.
For thou Lord giuest to thy beloued, sleepe they, wake they, much plentie, al kind of happines.
Make vs therfore, bountiful God, to loase our nets in thy Name and to doe the works of our calling earnestlie with inuocation of thy diuine assistance, that by thy blessing we may haue good successe.
Protect al waifaring men, and trauelers, either sailing by seas to far countries, or iorneieng by land for our common welfare, that they may safelie returne home againe.
Take thou the defence of Merchants with their goods and riches so shal they be secure from al misfortune.
Dispose their minds and wits, that in their trafike they may deale without fraude, couen, and abuse of thy Name, measuring al things according to the rule of iustice, and therby reteine a good conscience
Make them to loue virtue, to keepe promise, to obserue couenants, that no man oppresse or circumuent his brother for God is the reuenger of al such.
Grant also to al buiers of villages, houses, lande, yokes of oxen, that for the loue and desire of earthlie riches, and filthie lucre, they forget not the kingdome of God, and so make excuse that they cannot come to thy great, and heauenlie supper, wherevnto al men are called by the Gospel.
If riches encrease let not their harts be set vpon them: but afore al thinge prouide for themselues the treasure hid in the field, and the pretious iewel of thy celestial kingdome.
To al workemen and laborers grant that they be faithful in their busines: make them also strong aswel in bodie, as in iudgement.
Giue vs good seruants, vpright gouernors, an happie state of Commonweale, a wholesome temperature of aire, health, peace, discipline, &c. Keepe our mindes from couetousnes, which is the roote of al euil, least being bewitched therewithal, we swarue from the faith, and wrap our selues in manie sorrowes.
But gouerne vs by thy Spirit, that al our care may be cast vpon thee our Father, and we be content with dailie bread.
Blesse vs moreouer that we abuse not thy temporal benefits, neither glut our selues with meate drinke to the ouercoming of our harts by surfetting, and dronkennes but may vse thy blessings moderately to our comfort.
Giue patience to the poore that they neither murmur against thy wil, and their condition, neither enuie their betters, and so offend thee, and breake thy commandements.
Let not rich men be either high minded or confident in vncertaine riches, but in thee the liuing God (which giuest to vs abundantly al things to enioie) that they doe good, and be rich in good workes, that they be readie to giue, glad to distribute, and laieng vp in store for themselues a good foundation against the time to come, that they may obteine eternal life.
Two things we doe require of thee our God denie them not before we die.
Remoue from vs vanitie and lies; giue vs neither pouertie nor riches, onlie grant vs things necessarie for this life: least peraduenture being ful we should denie thee, and saie, Who is God? or being oppressed with pouertie we fal to stealing, and take the Name of thee our God in vaine, Amen.
Christ eternal God, which hast commanded vs to denie our selues and dailie to take vp our crosse, follow thee our capitaine, and maister in much patience.
For it cannot be auoided, but that al which desire to liue godlie in thee our Lorde, must suffer persecution.
And wee cannot be thy seruants and soldiers vnles wee can abide the persecution of the greater part of mankinde.
For Satan wil neuer surcesse from arming his villains with furiousnes against thy members.
And it falleth out commonlie in this licentious wickednes of the world, that the godlie, euen through the zeale of righteousnes doe purchase to themselues the hatred of the wicked.
Especiallie it is incident vnto Christians to be abhorred of the maior part of mankinde.
For flesh in no case can awaie with the preaching of the Gospel, and none wel+suffer the reprehension of their vices.
Hence arise persecutions for the destruction of the godlie, whereby in no place they can be safe and secure, but their endes are sought by al kindes of crueltie.
Wherfore we beseech thee, on the behalfe of al persecuted for righteousnes sake against whom despiteful words are vsed, lies inuented: and for as manie as for thy Name sake are detained in prison, fettered, attainted before counsels whipped, brought afore Kings and Princes to be tormented with exquisite and diuers punishments for the confession of true religion: for such as are exiled from their natiue soiles banished, spoiled of their goods, abhorred of the world, tried by torments, racked, hanged vpon forkes, vpon wheeles, killed by swords, like sheepe for the slaughter murthered, and throwen out to be deuoured of the rauenous and cruel beasts for thy Gospels sake Al these assist, and laie to thine hande for our strengthening, the glorie and Spirit of God may rest vpon vs, by whose consolation we may suffer al trobles, and by an inuincible courage get the victorie in al these, and neuer fal from the hope of our saluation.
Grant therefore that we may haue the testimonie of a good conscience, knowing that we are punished vndeseruedlie, not as murtherers or theeues, or euil doers, or busiebodies in other mens matters.
And, suffering as Christians let vs not be ashamed, but glorifie God on that behalfe.
Giue vs grace to account it for exceeding ioie when we fal into diuers tentations, and afflictions; and to glorie therein
For affliction bringeth forth patience; patience, experience; experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed.
And let their example which before vs did suffer the like in their bodies, be a comfort vnto vs.
For so did the vngodlie persecute the Prophets which were before vs.
And especiallie thy steps, which are left to be followed are aboue al to be allowed of.
For thou diddest saie The seruant is not greater than his maister; if they haue persecuted me, they wil persecute you also.
Finallie giue grace, that, respecting the vnspeakable reward which of thine onelie mercie thou diddest promise to al which perseuer vnto the ende by thine assistance we may ouercome al the greeuousnes of affliction.
For blessed dost thou pronounce them which suffer persecution for righteousnes sake for theirs is the kingdome of heauen: that, when they are prooued, they may receiue the crowne of life which thou hast promised to such as loue thee.
Wherefore indue al in affliction with thy fortitude from aboue, that with a bolde and stoute courage they may reioice that they are counted worthie to suffer shame, and al kindes of affliction for thy Name.
Make them constant in the true confession, that through the consideration of cruel punishment they depart not from the faith, and forsake the profession of true religion.
Likewise shew forth thine omnipotencie, with thy mightie hand deliuer them from the power of Tyrans; from the mouthes of Lions and violence of fire.
And as concerning such, whose bodilie deliuerance were not best, but are fittest for martyrdome, those strengthen in the middes of paine, that they feare not such as kil the bodie but cannot kil the soule; that being afflicted according to thy wil, they may commit the keeping of their soules to thee with wel doing as vnto a faithful Creator; and so though they leese (as may seeme) their soules in this world: yet shal they find them safe and blessed in another life which is eternal, where thou liuest and raignest with the Father in the vnitie of the holie Spirit, a God for euermore, Amen.
Most merciful, and faithful God, father of orphanes iudge of widowes; Looke downe from heauen, thou which considerest our labor, and sorow, and in whose hands al our saluation doth consist.
The poore is left vnto thee: for thou art the helper of the fatherles
The Lord doth heare the desire of the poore, thou preparest their harts, and thine eare harkeneth thervnto: to helpe the fatherles and widowe vnto their right, that the man of the earth be no more exalted against the miserable.
We beseech thee, most righteous auenger, haue thou a consideration of al widowes and orphanes, and prouide for them by ministring clothes nourishment vnto them, haue pittie on them in al their perils, and necessities; stretch out thine helping hande and deliuer them as thou didest that widowe, whose pitcher of oile by the Prophet Elias thou didest so encrease with thy blessing, that not onlie she deliuered hir children in bondage for debt out of the hands of hir creditors; but also of the oile she sold, had wherewith to sustaine both hir selfe, and hir children.
For thou art the Lord which carest for strangers, and relieuest the fatherles and widowes but destroiest the waies of the vngodlie.
Thou art touched with a care of the afflicted, and despisest not the desires of the fatherles, nor the widow when she poureth out hir praiers before thee
For the teares running downe the cheekes of the widow ascend vp into the heauens: and hir crie against him, which wringes it out.
Grant therefore, merciful God, that in the sight of al gouernors, and iudges they may find fauor, and haue equal iudges and patrones of their matters: that the iudgement of the stranger and fatherles be not peruerted, nor the cause of the widow neglected but that iudgement may be sought according to thy lawe; the oppressed holpen; iudgement giuen for the orphane; and the widowe defended.
For thou hast giuen a straight commandement vnto al iudges, saieng Keepe equitie and righteousnes, deliuer the oppressed from the power of the oppressor, doe not grieue, nor oppresse the stranger, the fatherles, nor the widowe, and shed none innocent blood.
For thou art the God which wil auenge thine elect that crie vnto thee; thou keepest truth for euer and euer doing iustice to the oppressed with wrong
Now deliuer, Lord, the fatherles, and widowes out of the pawes of rauening theeues, which eate vp the houses of widowes vnder the pretence of godlines, and colour of right.
Deliuer them out of the hands of wicked iudges which faine and inuent lawes to suppresse the poore, and to hurt the cause of the base among the people, that widowes may be a praie for them; and that they mayrob the fatherles: such peruerse iudges, God, in the daie of their visitation and calamitie from a far thou wilt vtterlie destroy.
Appoint vnto orphanes and widowes faithful patrones which wil be touched with an earnest care of their welfare.
Also giue vs willing mindes to pleasure widowes and fatherles children, according to our habilitie, to deliuer the poore when he crieth and the fatherles, which hath none to helpe; to helpe him that is readie to fal, to comfort the widowes hurt; euermore to be as fathers to the fatherles, and from our tender yeares to minister instruction to the widowe, and suffer them neuer to perish, but in blessing to blesse them, and to fil them with bread
For pure religion and vndefiled before thee, God our Father, is to visit the fatherles, widowes in their aduersitie, and to keepe our selues vnspotted of the world.
For he which is merciful towards the orphane, as a father, sheweth himselfe as an husband towards his mother in taking the defence of their cause vpon him, he shal be as an obedient sonne of the Hiest, and thou God wilt more fauor him, than a mother can pittie hir sonne.
But they which despise the sight and teares of the widowe keepe back their loafe, that the fatherles eate not thereof, and suffer them to perish for want of clothing and apparel, yea, which lift vp their hands to afflict them, shal greuouslie be punished, their shoulders shal fal from their ioints, and their armes be broken from the bones of them.
merciful God, extende thy fauor vpon al widowes, that at al times and in al afflictions they may trust in thee the liuing God, and continue in supplications praiers night and daie, being diligent in al good works, not occupied in pleasures, neither wanton, idle, wandering from house to house, no tatlers, nor busiebodies, no speakers of things vncomelie, nor giuers of occasion whereby thy worde may be blasphemed.
Keepe al parents, that, they being taken awaie either by war, or vntimelie death, their wiues be not widowes, their sonnes orphanes, running here and there a begging, be thou their helper euen for Christ his sake our Lord, and Sauior, Amen.
Most merciful God, greatlie haue we sinned, and, alas, are guiltie of manifolde crimes.
For this cause diuerslie is our conscience clogged: so that we are wonderfullie agast beholding such bloodie wounds of our soules.
And albeit thy Gospel dailie doth offer vnto vs in good sooth forgiuenes of our sinnes, through thy meere grace: yet our faith is maruelouslie weake by reason of the infirmitie of our flesh, and dailie batterings of Satan, which by craft endeuoureth to plucke vs from al hope, and consolation.
Therefore vnto thee doe we crie, most holie Father, and eternal God, keepe vs in thy Name, that in tentations and extremities·we neuer faint in courage.
Moderate and mitigate our vexations, let them come to a ioieful ende, that we fal not into the most heinous sinne of incredulitie, and despaire.
Comfort vs, that in the middes of death, we may trust in thee, the God of our life, and righteousnes.
Let vs neuer despaire of thy mercie, grace, nor thinke with Cain that blasphemous cursed wretch, that our sinnes are mo than may be forgiuen.
staie vs Lord according to thy word; and we shal be safe.
Let vs alwaies beleue, that where sinne aboundeth grace doth more abounde: and as sinne hath raigned vnto death, so that grace doth raigne through righteousnes vnto eternal life by Iesus Christ our Lord.
Christ, Sauior of the world, and most gratious God, whose mercie commeth vpon vs like a streame, art the eternal Orator, which both outwardlie talkest to mankinde by thy Gospel, and inwardlie in our harts inflamest thy light which is true confession, faith, and comfort in thee: we beseech thee from the bottome of our harts, encre faith establish hope, then patience within vs.
For this certainelie is one little drop of thy most blood, shed for vs, is of more power to saue vs, than al our enormous, manifold sinnes to condemne vs. Wherfore looke back vpon vs, Sauior, with thine eies of mercie, as thou lookedst back vpon Peter in the hal of the hie Priests house after he had both renounced thee and cursed himselfe; least through diffidence we fal from thy grace, as Iudas the traitor did, which hoong himselfe and afterward brake in the middes whereby al his bowels gushed out and so commit the like offence and sinne against the holie Ghost.
God the holie Ghost, be thou present with vs at our extreeme neede, when the Diuels wil accuse vs, and our conscience beare witnes against vs; when the cogitations of hel, and death wil daunt vs; when we shal be enuironed with horrible dangers, and tentations; when the whole world wil forsake vs; and al set themselues against vs, our harts, at that time with the seale that vndoubtedlie beleeue the forgiuenes of sinnes, the resurrection of the flesh, and euerlasting life, which shal be giuen without faile to vs, and to al beleeuers.
blessed Trinitie, and eternal God of one essence, giue grace that in euerie combate, and especiallie at the point of death, being mindful of thy couenant made with vs at our christening, and of thy most comfortable promise annexed.
He which beleeueth, and is baptised shal be saued we may neuer doubt either of thy merciful goodwil toward vs, or of the free remission of our sinnes, but, by often remembring this signe and couenant, may dailie more and more be confirmed in faith, and hope of perpetual happines; and applie thy benefits, which certainelie thou hast promised, faithfullie wilt performe, vnto our selues.
For thy promises made to such as beleeue trust on thee, be not vaine, and to no purpose.
Likewise vpholde our soules by the Sacrament of thy Supper, that strengthened with the seale of this newe testament, wee may be the more certaine, and confirmed touching our reconciliation, and euerlasting righteousnes, and alwaies beare it fixed in our minds.
For if the testament of a man which is proued after the death of the testator be not smal accounted of; much more should the last testament, and holie sacrament of our Sauior Christ, remaine pure, in continual force, and remembrance.
blessed Trinitie, and eternal Vnitie, lift vp our sorowful harts, and poure vpon vs the wholesome comfort of heauenlie blisse; at the point of death refresh vs with the sweete sight of thy cheereful countenance, that with exceeding ioie we may desire to depart, to come into thine heauenlie house, where thou liuest and raignest a God for euermore, Amen.
WE wil co~fesse thee, Lord King and praise thee, God our Sauior: we giue thankes vnto thy Name.
For thou art our defender, and helper, and hast preserued our bodies from destruction, and from the snares of the slanderous tongues, and from the lips that are occupied with lies.
Thou hast bin our helper from such as stoode vp against vs, and deliuered vs after the multitude of thy mercies; and for thine holie Name sake from the roaring of the~ which were readie to deuour vs; out of the hands of such as sought after our liues; and from the manifold afflictions which we had; from the deepe of hel; from an vncleane tong; from lieng words; from false accusations, and from vnrighteous sentence.
Euils enuironed vs on euerie side, and there was no man to helpe vs.
We looked about if there were any man to succour vs, but there was none.
Then thought we vpon thy mercie, Lorde, and vpon thine actes that thou euer hast done of old.
For thou deliuerest al which put their trust in thee, and riddest them out of the handes of their enimies.
Then wee lifted vp our praiers from the earth, and praied for deliuerance from death.
We called vpon the Lord, the father of our Lord, that he would not leaue vs without helpe in the daie of our truble, and in the time of the proude.
We wil praise thy Name continuallie, yeelding honor and thanks vnto the same.
For our praiers were heard, and thou hast saued vs from destruction, and from al euil.
Therefore we wil acknowledge, and praise thee; we wil magnifie thy Name, for keeping vs from our youth vntil this present weeke, and for protecting vs alwaies of thy gratious mercie.
Righteous, and merciful God, before thee doe we sigh, beseeching thee by the death and burial of our Lord and Sauior Christ thy welbeloued Sonne, that thou wouldest vouchsafe to couer, and burie al our misdeedes, whatsoeuer from our infancy vntil this present houre either wittinglie, or ignorantlie we haue committed, and especiallie those which this weeke we haue done in thought, word, or deede, against thy diuine maiestie and commandements, al which to thee alone which knowest al things we confesse with broken harts, and lowlie spirits, beseeching thee to pardon them, and to forgiue al our sinnes, whereof thou knowest we are guiltie; and to deliuer vs from al euils both present and to come.
Lord, heare the voice of our praier, encline thine eare vnto vs in the daies of our necessitie, when we shal crie vnto thee
The snares of death haue compassed vs about, and the straightes of hel haue taken holde of vs; we haue lighten vpon sorowe, and troble.
Notwithstanding we wil cal vpon the Lord, Lord, deliuer our soules.
Gratious is the Lord, and righteous, yea, our God is merciful.
The Lord preserueth the simple; we were in troble, and he helped vs. Turne then againe vnto your rest, our soules; For the Lorde wil blesse ye.
Thou wilt deliuer our soules from death, our eies from teares, and our feete from falling, that we may walke before thee in the lande of the liuing.
Christ, God, and Sauior of the worlde: saue vs, Lord, watching; keepe vs sleeping; that in peace we may both rest and wake.
Be thou our light in darknes, then shal our life be as cleere as the noone daie and shine forth as the morning; so that with confidence, and securitie we may lie downe, and sleepe, none shal make vs afraid, because thou art our protector.
Sonne of righteousnes, and brightnes of perpetual charitie, lead vs into the vision of thy light, where thou shalt euerlastinglie shine vpon vs, and thou God be our glorie.
The Sunne there shal not go downe, neither the Moone be hid: but thou, Lorde, shalt be our euerlasting light that our sorowful daies may take an ende.
Grant likewise that leauing this place of darkenes we may be translated into the true, and new light, which we now looke for through faith, vntil the perpetual morning appeere vnto vs, that we may beholde thee in a cleere light face to face where shal be no night, and we shal neede no candle, neither light of the Sunne, but thou Lorde wilt lighten vs. holie Spirit, God, be thou a light vnto vs.
At our last gaspe, when our harts pant our strength faileth; our sight departeth; our hearing is deafe; our mouth do~me; when our feete cannot go, nor our hands feele; when al our senses forsake vs, giue vs some sense of eternal life, that we may taste in this world the beginnings of thine euerlasting ioie: and at our departure out of this world behold by faith thy diuine presence, and so sleepe quietlie to eternal life, Amen.
Eternal God, which of thy great mercie hast vouchsafed to cal me, a miserable and most vnworthie man, to the ministerie of thy Gospel, and hast appointed me to be a feeder of soules and a fisher of men and now at the length segregated me, according to thy good pleasure, to preach the word of saluation vnto this flock, and people committed to my charge: With lowlines of spirit, sighes vnfained beseech thee, Christ, which art our chiefe shepheard and Archbishop, make me an able minister of the newe Testament a chosen vessel and profitable instrument for the carrieng of thy message before the nations, and Princes of this world, as it becommeth the minister of Christ and faithful dispenser of the mysteries of God, and neuer let me proue an idol, or idle shepherd.
Worke thou effectuallie through me, and grant good successe vnto my doings, that fruitefullie may vtter to mine auditors the healthful and heauenlie foode of their soules, which is the syncere preaching of thy gratious worde, without al corruption, or deprauing of the same.
Take not fro my lips the word of truth and let me not speake either the imaginations of my foolish braine, or the vaine perswasions of my owne hart but may vtter thine heauenlie worde, and minister according to the virtue which thou dost grant that in al things thy glorie may be sought of me: That follow not after couetousnes feeding my selfe and forsaking my flock; but giue me such an earnest care of their wel doing, that without constraint cheerefullie and gladlie, being bounde therevnto, may discharge mine office: That be not desirous of filthie lucre but with a willing minde may profit the Church; neither as an exerciser of auctoritie ouer my flock, but that, euen through an hartie zeale of thine holie Name, may feede, and make fat, in the plentiful, and godlie pastures of thy pure worde, thy sheepe committed to my trust: That may retaine a diligent consideration of the weaker sort and helpe the feeble, heale the sick, strengthen the bruzed; that may bring home that which is seduced, and seeke that is lost, and carefullie prouide for that which is strong; that labor not in mine office negligentlie nor accomplish the worke of thee my maister with deceipt.
almightie God, whose dwelling is aboue the cloudes, which hast appointed me a keeper, and watchman for thy people to forewarne the simple that they be not, through the subtiltie of vaine teachers, deceiued, seduced, and made a praie and spoile for the beasts of the field; make me so watchful, and careful ouer thy flock, that couragiouslie may withstand, and beate awaie those rauening wolues which teare and scatter thy flock, and, by reprouing and refuting their heresies, ouercome false prophets.
Giue me that vtterance and wisedome which none may resist, or gainesaie
Grant me a learned and eloquent vtterance to diuide thy word rightlie; and wisedome distinctlie, and in right order to propose the same, and to be able and readie to admonish and to comfort the weake, and, if anie offende through weakenes to wyn him vnto weldoing by the spirit of meekenes, and modestlie to rebuke such as may be recouered, but those, which openlie doe sinne without blushing, to take vp before the congregation not regarding the person, that the rest, by their example, may feare, and forsake their wickednes.
Sonne of God, our continual Intercessor, which hast ordeined me to be a voice crieng endue mee with the grace of thine holie Spirit, that may exalt my voice like a trumpet and declare their wickednes vnto thy people, and neuer shewe my selfe as a domme dog which cannot bark: so shal not be partaker of their sinnes, nor guiltie of their condemnation, neither wilt thou require their blood at mine hands Wherefore againe, and againe beseech thee, assist me euermore that through an open and bold reprehending of their wickednes, may deliuer my soule in the daie of wrath, and teach thy waies vnto the wicked whereby the vngodlie may repent.
Finallie, so blesse me with thy fauor, that may walke in thy feare, as it becommeth me, and be an ensample of good life vnto my flock least, while preach vnto others my selfe proue a castawaie; that in no case through my wicked conuersation giue occasion to anie man of blaspheming thy worde; and that in trobles, and persecutions faint not, but may suffer patientlie the reproch of this world, and the manifold trobles that Satan stirreth vp to disquiet thy Church.
Grant also to as manie as shal heare thy worde from my mouth, that they may firmelie with me beleeue the same, and be the followers of me as followe thee and haue consideration of such as walke so, as becommeth Christians, that together we may continue in faith, and patience, euen for thine owne sake, Amen.
Giue thee most hartie thanks, eternal God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, for that it hath pleased thee of thine vnspeakable mercie, and goodnes in al ages continuallie to sende into the worlde men wonderful in thy gifts and knowledge of thy wil to be renuers, and spreaders forth of thy truth Like thankes ascribe vnto thy sacred Maiestie for allowing vs shepherds and preachers in these our daies for the gathering together of thy Church out of al mankinde to the building of the bodie of Christ.
Humblie beseech thee, gratious GOD, continue alwaie among vs thy pure worde through thy ministers; gather vnto thy selfe an euerlasting Congregation, so instruct mine hart with thy Spirit of truth, that vnfainedlie may assent to thy wholesome worde, proue a liuelie member of thy bodie, and be incorporated into that societie which both in this world doth syncerelie confesse thee, and euermore extol thine holie Name.
Keepe those Preachers which thou dost, and wilt giue in the certaine knowledge of thy blessed wil, that they may from time to time both open vnto vs thine intent concerning the repairing of mankinde, the saluation, and redemption of our soules through thy free mercie; and also teach vs how to liue in new obedience, and to abstaine from carnal desires which fight against the soule.
Inspire thy ministers, and preachers of thy word with thine holie Spirit, that they may vtter thy wil purelie as they haue receiued it from thine hands, retaining the forme of wholesome words and sounding onlie that doctrine which is vttered by thy Sonne out of thy bosome
For otherwise, departing from the order of faith, and the rule of thy worde, they wil greatlie obscure the light of thy doctrine; and obtrude vpon vs the vanitie of their owne inuentions.
Wherefore let them speake thy word not deceiptfullie but syncerelie, euen as from thee, and in thy sight.
Grant also, that, by transforming thy ministerie into policie, they Lord not ouer thine elect neither contend about superioritie and primacie in thy Church; but onelie to seeke the glorie of thy Name, and the saluation both of themselues, and vs. Giue them libertie of speech boldlie without feare to blame and rebuke al false doctrine, blasphemous superstition, and abuses in thy Church.
Open vnto them the doore of vtterance that they may speake the mysteries of Christ, and manifest them as they ought to doe, so shal their doings be profitable vnto the godlie.
Assist them also with thine especial grace, that they disgrace not their doctrine by impuritie of life, but let their conuersation answere vnto the doctrine which they teach and preach.
Especiallie for the shepherd of my soule, fro~ whose mouth learne thy blessed wil, hartilie praie, that thou wilt keepe him in religion, syncere; and pure from enormous offences in outward conuersation: endue him with a long and healthful life, if it be thy good pleasure, that manie a good daie, and yeere he may continue in preaching the gladsome voice of thy gratious Gospel among vs without contention and strife.
And, Sonne of God, which art the Lord of al the flock, worke thou effectuallie by thy preachers, speake thou within vs to our harts the blessed wil of thine eternal Father, and confirme thy doctrine in our minds by thine holie Spirit.
Grant that we may truelie know, and discerne the same from the houling of wolues, and from the inchanted songs of seducing hirelings and grant that we may know thee euen as thou knowest thine heauenlie Father, and to walke religiouslie, and righteouslie in thy sight, shewing our selues to be of that holie seede which praiseth thy Name for euermore.
Come holie Spirit, open mine hart and eares that may conceaue the profite of thy wholesome doctrine, and the sweete comfort reuealed in thine holie word, by the preaching of the Gospel.
Lorde, acknowledge with teares my sluggishnes, carelesnes in seeking thy truth, and bewaile the wretched coldnes, and hardnes of mine hart, beseeching thee to endue me with an vnfained longing, and an ardent desire of holie Sermons.
Grant that in this life may worship the feete of the preachers of peace, and reuerence the true dispensors of thy mysteries, thy faithful ministers with doble honor and none otherwise to obeie their godlie sermons, than woulde if a voice should sounde from the heauens.
Let me not for the blemishes and imperfections of some particular men, vnreuerentlie conceaue of thine whole ministerie.
Worke also within me, that, despising thy word deliuered vnto vs, neuer seeke after strange reuelations, or violent rauishings both besides, and contrarie to thy worde, but, bearing alwaies in minde the order which thou hast appointed, may constantlie embrace thy word manifested in the Church.
Finallie impart such grace vpon vs, that we may imitate, and folowe the good workes of holie men, casting of the old man by putting on the new which is created after God in righteousnes, and true holines, Amen.
For to thee appertaineth al magnificence, and power, and glorie; to thee belongeth al honor, and auctoritie.
For whatsoeuer is either in the heauens aboue, or in the earth beneath it is thine.
Thine, Lord, is the kingdome; thou art aboue al Princes Kings.
Riches are thine, glorie is thine, and thou art Lorde ouer al.
God of my Fathers Lord of mercie which hast made al things by thy word, and by thy wisedome appointed man to rule the creatures which thou hast made, and to gouerne the world with equitie and iustice, praise thee, and extol thy glorious Name for appointing me thy seruant to rule and gouerne this thy people committed vnto my charge.
Now therefore, gratious Lord, fauor ablic beholde me, that may treade the path of truth, righteousnes, and synceritie of hart in thy sight.
Let me not abuse mine auctoritie but gouerne with lenitie gentlenes the people vnder me, that liuing a godlie and honest life mankind may enioy their desired peace.
Giue therefore vnto thy seruant an hart desirous of instructions, that may iudge the people, descerne betweene good and euil and, neither declining to the right hand or to the left, stoutlie, and valiantlie maintaine the cause of the righteous.
Grant me counsel, and assistance to doe such things as are grateful vnto thee, good for thy Church, and profitable for my people, and Commonweale.
Giue me thy wisedome and reiect me not from thy children.
For thy seruant, and sonne of thine handmaide, am a fraile man, of a short time, and ful weake in the vnderstanding of iudgement, and the lawes.
Thou hast chosen me a gouernor of thy people, and a iudge of thy sonnes, and daughters: sende me therefore wisedome from thy sacred heauens, and from the seate of thy magnificence, that it may be with me, and labor with me, whereby may perceiue what is acceptable in thine eies, and learne that haue no power of my selfe, but from thee which art almightie, raignest ouer the kingdomes of men, giuing them at thy pleasure
Grant that neuer conceaue proudlie of my selfe, but may receiue in patience the discipline of thy Lawe. Make mee wise and circumspect, that neither offer· iniurie to anie man, neither suffer anie to be iniuried; that so equitie may be maintained, and iustice among men preserued.
Let me at no time vnder the shewe, and color of equitie vphold, or countenance a wicked cause: neither yet without sufficient examination and trial of both parties, giue sentence against anie.
Allowe me such counselers, gouernors, and ouerseers as are of courage fearing God, dealing vprightlie, hating couetousnes, that by them the burden, charge, and care which sustaine, may be somewhat lightened.
Endue both me, and them with thine holie Spirit, that with earnest studie, and watchful minds we may discerne betwene matters that no man through our negligence haue the ouerthrow in a righteous cause, but that sentence be rightlie pronounced betweene a man, and his brother, and a stranger without respect of anie person in iudgement.
Let vs heare aswel the litle as the great, and feare no man.
Because the iudgement is thine, which standest in the companie of iudges, and among the Gods thou plaiest the iudge.
For the iudgement is not of man but of the Lord: and, whatsoeuer we shal iudge it wil come vpon vs. Wherefore, let thy feare be with vs that we may doe al things with care and circumspection, that we proue not children in vnderstanding, neither giue our selues to dronkennes and bellicheere, but to eate our meate in due season and that for strength, not for dronkennes.
For thou wilt make earnest, and diligent enquirie of al our workes and search al our cogitations: because we are thy seruants, and deputies to gouerne; men of a very short life; and he which is to daie a King to morow may be dead.
For we be al mortal and subiect to one, and the same corruption.
Besides, an horrible iudgement is nigh for such as walke not after the wil of thee our God.
For he that is most low, shal finde mercie, but the mightie shal be mightilie tormented.
For thou, which art the Lord ouer al, regardest not the person of anie neither doest thou feare the greatnes of the mightie.
Because aswel the great as the smal are the workemanship of thine handes; thy care is equal ouer al; and giuest to godlie Princes eternal happines, which art the Iudge both of the quicke and dead, liuing and raigning with thy Sonne in the vnitie of the Spirit, a God for euermore, Amen.
Almightie God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, in thine hande is al power both in heauen and earth thou confirmest kingdomes, and againe doest alter them according to thine heauenlie pleasure, &c.
GOD almightie, auctor, and institutor of matrimonie, which in the copling together of male and female dost offer vnto vs a consideration of the sacred, and great mysterie of the marriage of our Lord and Sauior Christ, with his spouse the Church and with al expresse the most burning affection of thy sonne towards his beloued Spouse.
For he offered himselfe vpon the altar of the crosse to sanctifie, and clense hir by the washing of water through the word, and to make hir glorious for himselfe, without spot, or wrincle, or any such thing.
For euen as the husband by an inseparable bande of good wil is bound to the wife, so that both prosperitie and aduersitie is common to them both: so is Christ copled to his Church through suffering vpon his owne flesh the punishme~t which was due vnto hir, and by making vs with him felowe heires of eternal ioie, by couering our offences.
So that now there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesu which walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Whereby we gather that man should loue his wife euen as his owne bodie.
For no man euer yet hated his owne flesh howsoeuer crooked, old, weak, leane, or deformed it be: but so much the more carefullie doth hide couer those faults by how much they appeere the more deformed.
Yea he doth nourish, and cherish that weake part, euen as Christ doth loue his Church though foule, and deformed with sinne, which casteth not hir of, though she seeme il fauored, but healeth hir griefes, dissembleth much, forgiueth, and wypeth awaie hir offences.
beseech thee, Father, which art neither made nor begotten, marrie mee for euer vnto thy Sonne; marrie me vnto him in righteousnes, iudgement, in godlines, and mercie; marrie me vnto him in faith, that may truelie knowe thee my Lorde and God, which wilt not the death of a sinner but rather that he repent and liue.
thou onlie begotten Sonne of God, ioine me beseech thee vnto thy bodie, that ingraffed in thee, may drawe from thee the iuice of life, and of heauenlie wisedome.
Defende mee, and thine whole Church against the rage of Satan, the world, and the flesh.
Loue, cherish, and comfort such as are ingraffed to thy flesh.
Purge and wash me fro my sinnes, filthines, and spots through thy great mercie and merits.
Annoint me with thine oile of gladnes put vpon me thy roabes of righteousnes, and couer me with thy glorious purple; adorne me with the pretious stones of virtue, and place vpon mine head glorie and honor, that al mine ornament may be inward, and that may please thee through hoping in thy mercie.
For thou art mine husbande which louest me; my God whom worship; and the head wherevnto am subiect.
Giue me grace that neuer delight in mine owne fairenes, and so plaie the harlot following mine old louers, which promise me bread and water, wol, flaxe, oile, drinke.
God the holie Ghost, which maintainest the loue of married folkes within our brests, humblie beseech thee, inflame the heate of chaste affection betweene al married folkes.
Giue me wisedome discretelie to dwel with my wife considering alwaies that naturallie she is weake: and for that cause must beare with much foolishnes, and swalowe vp manie sorrowes when shal perceiue the weaknes of hir affections.
And for asmuch as am the head of my wife giue mee grace with iudgement godlie both to instruct hir, and to bring vp my familie in the knowledge and feare of thy Name.
Let me neither ouer nicelie bring them vp, nor to roughlie entreate them, but gently vse them, that they may both continue in thy feare, and yeeld me due obedience, but especiallie liue godlie in thine eies.
Blesse thou my wife that she may proue a sweet companion vnto me, louing mee vnfainedlie from the hart without dissimulation; so that may safelie trust in hir and she may render vnto mee good for good, not euil for good.
God, which art a chaste minde, make me with a chaste bodie and pure affectio~ to serue thee in chaste matrimonie, and neuer with a wicked eie to beholde the wife of another man to lust after hir neither yet to forsake my proper bed with the losse of my soule.
Driue awaie Satan the mortal enimie to this thine ordinance, that he sowe not contentions, braules betweene vs. Cut of al occasions of debate, and sinister suspicions, that so in a true conioining together of minds we may in this world liue virtuouslie, and hereafter in the worlde to come raigne eternallie according to thy worde, Amen.
OEternal, and euerliuing God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, maker of heauen and earth, which hast inioined vnto vs children that with due obedience we honor our parents which thing not onelie true religion doth exact, but also natural reason doth binde vs vnto.
Besides, thou art maruelouslie delighted with such obedience of children towarde their parents for thy Sonnes sake our Lorde.
And that the more willinglie we may obeie them, thou hast made a singular promise of long life vnto vs.
And as the obedience of children which they owe, and shewe to their parents is exceedinglie grateful in thy sight: so contrariwise obstinacie and disobedience is most vnsauerie, and displeaseth thee.
The which may be gathered by the horriblenes of punishment which thou denouncest against stubborne, and disobedient children.
beseech thee therefore most humblie euen for thy Sonnes sake, in whom onelie thou delightest lighten the eies of mine vnderstanding, that aboue al may truelie and syncerelie acknowledge thee my principal Father of whom al the familie both in heauen, and earth is named; and, in true inuocation, and thankesgiuing, obeie; and, in true holines, and righteousnes serue thee my God, and heauenlie Father, from whom drewe vital breath my soule, and bodie, with al the faculties, and powers that haue.
For which cause am bound rather to obeie thee my maker than men; and to be occupied in those things which belong to thee my Father which art in heauen and cheerefullie to go about that which thou hast enioined me.
Secondlie giue me grace to honor mine earthlie parents in deede, and word in al patience, and neuer to be a cause of their sorow, and griefe of minde.
And when their vnderstanding shal faile through age be it far fro me that doe either disdaine or deride them, albeit am beautified with neuer so excellent gifts of nature, but make me to beare with the weaknes of their age, as am bound both by thy word and in conscience to doe, so shal be blessed.
For he which honoreth his parents shal haue ioie of his owne children, and when he maketh his praier he shal be heard.
Lord, forgiue thou my sinnes whereby haue offended my louing parents.
remember not the sinnes of my youth nor my rebellions: but according to thy mercie remember thou me, euen for thy goodnes sake, Lord.
Let the example of thy Sonne my Sauior Christ, which in his childhoode was obedient vnto his parents be depainted, and fixed alwaies in my minde, the better to obeie them which begat, and haue brought me vp, and to relieue them being weake either through age or sicknes.
For he which forsaketh his father shal come to shame: and he that angreth his mother is cursed of God.
Likewise let it please thee to giue me a willing hart to obeie my teachers, and betters, and to omit no part of dutie, and reuerence which owe: so that may alwaies declare my selfe to be a decliner from euil and a doer of good, a seeker of peace, and a follower of the same.
Christ Iesu, which hast giuen to weake yeeres the benefit of docilitie, giue likewise to the towardnes of my nature the aide of thy grace, that may learne good nurture, and liberal artes seruing to the aduancement of thy glory, wherby the more easilie may attaine to the knowledge of thee, whom to know is perfect happines, and felicitie
For thou art the fountaine from whence al wisedome vnderstanding proceedeth without whom al our studies lacke good successe.
Wherefore at thy hands doe beg wisedome which giuest liberallie without reproching any man.
Lighten thou mine vnderstanding with thy grace, that, hauing learned the liberal artes, and the tongues, may applie them to those endes wherevnto they serue, that, according to thy sacred infancie, may profite as in yeeres, so in wisedome and virtue both afore thee, and man
God the holie Ghost, purifie mine hart by a liuelie faith, that spend not my time in vaine pleasure cockering mine affections.
Extinguish in me the flames of doting, and filthie loue, and let me neuer serue the lust of the flesh like horse and mule which haue none vnderstanding.
Thine hands, Lord, haue made, and fashioned me giue me vnderstanding, that may learne thy Lawe.
am smal, and of no reputation, yet wil neuer forget thy righteousnes.
For thy righteousnes is a perfect righteousnes, and thy Lawe is truth, Amen.
Vse the praier for yong folks, which you shal finde afore, pag.
Omnipotent, eternal God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, maker, and preseruer both of heauen and earth, together with thy coeternal Sonne, and the holie Ghost: We haue sinned Lord, with our fathers, we haue committed iniquitie, and done wickedlie.
Therefore we openlie confesse that by thy righteous iudgement we are iustlie punished; and rightlie deserue that barbarous, and vngodlie nations, shoulde spoile vs of our goods, ouerthrowe our schooles, Churches, and Commonweales; make vnmerciful hauocke of the promiscuous multitude, and carie miserable men from the sweete bosomes of thy deere friendes into a slauerie more greeuous than death.
God, it is thou which repellest vs, yea thou dost confounde vs before the nations for our sinnes and goest not forth with our armies to the battel.
Thou makest vs to turne our backs vpo~ our enimies, so that they which hate vs spoile our goods.
Thou sufferest vs to be eaten vp like sheepe, and hast scattered vs among the Heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for naught, and takest no monie for them.
Therefore be the Heathen come into thine inheritance thy holie Temple haue they defiled; they haue destroied our townes, and houses, and brought them into an heape of stones.
The dead bodies of thy seruants haue they giuen to be meate for foules of the aire, and the flesh of thy Saints vnto the beastes of the lande.
Their blood haue they shed like waters on euerie side, and there was no man to burie them.
We are become an open shame to our enimies: a verie scorne and byword vnto them that are rounde about vs. Wherefore in these mischieuous wars, and in the middes of our fatal punishments, we flie vnto thee, saieng Helpe vs, God of our saluation, for the glorie of thy Name; deliuer vs, and be merciful vnto our sinnes for thy Name sake.
deale not with vs after our sinnes neither reward vs after our iniquities.
Remember not our former sins but let thy tender mercie preuent vs.
Looke vpon our affliction and trauel and forgiue al our sinnes.
Behold our enimies for they are manie, and they hate vs with cruel hatred.
Thou which hast forgiuen the iniquitie of thy people and couered al their sinnes; and hast withdrawen al thine anger, and turned back fro~ the fiercenes of thy wrath: turne vs, we humblie beseech thee, God our Sauior, remoue awaie thy displeasure, that in true repentance we may please thee for thy Sonne his sake.
Wilt thou be displeased with vs for euer? or wilt thou prolong thy wrath from one generation to another? let the sorowful sighing of thy prisoners come before thee: according to the greatnes of thy power preserue those which are appointed to die.
Poure out thine indignation vpon the heathen that knowe thee not, and vpon the kingdomes which cal not vpon thy Name: that al nations may knowe the vengeance of the blood of thy seruantes that is shed.
Consider the mortal threatnings of our enimies, that they may be hindered from exercising their tyrannie vpon vs, saieng triumphinglie, Where is now their God? Keepe from our necks the greeuous yoake of Antechristian bondage, and represse the furiousnes of al Tyrans, which labor to spoile and make hauock of thy Church; to abolish true doctrine, praiers, pure religion; and to bring in idolatrie, errors, blasphemous ceremonies.
Suffer not our townes to be reduced into dennes for Tyrans, and other bloodie nations, which hate both thee, and vs extreemelie.
Arme the right arme of our Gratious Queene, and hir Nobles, that they may fight for our Lawes, liues, and libertie.
Teach their hands to fight and their fingers to battel; encrease in the~ an inuincible courage of minde, that enflamed through the zeale of thy religion, they may valiantlie withstande their, euen thine, enimies.
Guide thou the hands of such as fight in the cause of religion· and grant them happie successe ouer al their enimies.
For a King is not saued by the multitude of an host neither is the mightie man deliuered by great strength, but the victorie commeth from heauen
At thy rebuke, Lord, both the charret, and horse fal downe
Thou wilt take awaie the courage of Princes, and art terrible to the Kings of the earth.
be thou our helpe in troble for vaine is the helpe of man.
Through thee we shal do valiantlie; for thou wilt tread our enimies vnder our feete, and make them come to naught, through our Lord Iesus Christ, Amen.
praier to be saide in the time of the plague, sicknes, and mortalitie.
Lorde our God, great feareful art thou keeping couenant mercie with the~ that loue thee, and keepe thy commandements: We haue sinned, Lord, and haue committed iniquitie, we haue done wickedlie, yea we haue rebelled, and haue departed from thy precepts, and from thy iudgements; we haue not obeied thy seruants the Prophets which spake in thy Name to our Kings and Princes; to our forefathers, and to al the people of the lande.
Lord righteousnes belongeth vnto thee, but vnto vs open shame and confusion, as it is come to passe this daie by the plague and sicknes raigning among vs, and among al the dwellers of this lande, because of the sinnes which we haue done against thee.
Vnto thee our Lord and God pertaineth compassion and forgiuenes, though we haue rebelled against thee.
We haue not obeied thy voice to walke in the lawes which thou hast laide before vs.
We haue hitherto despised thy diuine worde yea, we haue loathed preaching, and haue loaed the bridle to al beastlines of desires.
Therefore the curse and oth which is written in the lawe of Moses thy seruant, is poured vpon vs, and we, through the plague, and corrupt aiers, with burning feauers, and grieuous sicknes are lamentablie consumed euerie daie.
Yea in our knees and legs are we smitten with most lothsome botches, those incurable, fro~ the sole of the foote vnto the top of the hed.
Because we repent not, neither obserue al the words written in thy lawe, nor feare thy glorious and dreadful name, thou dost, according to thy threatnings aforetolde, encrease our plagues, and the plagues of our seede; thou sendest great plagues and of long continuance, euil sicknes and of long durance, thou bringest vpon vs vncureable diseases, al maner of sicknes, and al kinds of plagues, besides those written in the booke of the lawe.
Al these plagues, according to thy worde are come vpon vs, yet haue we not praied vnto thee our Lorde, that we might euerie man turne from his vngodlie waies.
Therefore hast thou bin watchful in punishing vs, and in bringing these euils vpon vs. Thou art righteous, Lord and true is thy iudgment.
God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, thou hast got thee a glorious Name as may appeere this daie.
Lord our God, we haue sinned we haue done wickedlie, we haue behaued our selues vngodlie, in al thine ordinances.
Turne thy wrath from vs, we beseech thee, for we are but a fewe left in this place.
Lord God which hast promised, that, when either pestilence is among vs or the aire infected, or any other plague or sicknes is hot, thou wilt heare the praiers, and grant the requests of any man among the people, praieng from the bottom of his hart, acknowledging his sinnes vnfainedlie, and lifting vp his hands vnto thee through Iesus Christ before the throne of grace Be thou merciful giue vnto euerie man according to al his petitions.
For thou alone knowest the harts of al the children of men.
Heare thou our praiers and petitions, and deliuer vs from this contagious, and deadlie pestilence.
Commande thine Angel which striketh vs, to put vp his sworde into the sheath that he strike vs not to our final and vtter destruction; proceede not in thy wrath, spare vs fro~ death, and bring not our ende by the plague.
Let the heauens be milde, our dwelling places healthful, least the aire being infected poure downe the contagion thereof vpon vs to our destruction.
Lord, turne awaie thine hand, it is sufficient let now thine hand cease, that al the earth may know how that thou Lord art our God, and that we doe cal vpon thy name.
Lord looke downe from thine holie house vpon vs, encline thine eare, and heare vs. Open thine eies and beholde the affliction and mortalitie of thy people.
For the dead, whose spirits are taken awaie, giue vnto thee neither praise, nor righteousnes, but the oule that is vexed for the multitude of hir sinnes, which goeth on heauilie and weakelie, whose eies begin to faile; yea the hungrie soule is it that ascribeth due praise and righteousnes vnto thee, Lord.
For we poure out our praiers before thee, and require mercie in thy sight, Lord our God, not for anie worthines either of our owne, or of our fathers but in the name of thy sonne Iesus Christ, in whom thou art wel pleased we beseech thee, be merciful vnto vs, and helpe vs in necessitie.
Turne thee againe Lord, at the last, and be merciful vnto thy seruants; that this poisoned infection may be taken from vs. Notwithstanding if it be thy pleasure to visite our offences with the rod thy blessed wil be done and giue vs grace to beare thy fatherlie correction laide vpon vs pacientlie remembring alwaies that we are chastened of thee our Lorde in this world, that we be not condemned with the reprobate in the world to come, Amen.
Most wise and mightie God, thou art a glorious King in al the world, thy woonderful maiestie doth shine and is knowen also by raine, thundering, lightening, and other meteors ingendered in the aire: thy throne is among the cloudes, thou hast made darckenes thy secrete place and thy pauilion about thee euen darknes of water, and cloudes of the aire.
At the brightnes of thy presence the cloudes doe passe awaie, so doe the hailestones, and fierie coles.
Thou dost thunder from the heauens, and giuest thy voice, hailestones, and coales of fire.
Thou sendest thy arrowes, and scatterest them; thou encreasest lightnings and destroiest them.
Who is so great a God as thou, our God? Thou art the God which dost woonders, and declarest my power among the nations.
The waters sawe thee, and were afraide; the depthes trembled.
The cloudes poured out water, the aire thundred, thine arrowes went abroade.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about; the lightnings lightened the worlde, the earth trembled, and shooke.
The foundations of the earth were discouered at thy rebuking Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy nostrels.
Therfore shal the verie heauens extol thy wonderous workes and the Saints set forth thy truth in the Congregation.
For who is equal to thee in heauen? and who like thee among the sonnes of the Gods? Thou art verie terrible in the assemblie of the saints, and to be reuerenced aboue al that are about thee.
Lord, God of hosts, who is like vnto thee? which art a mighty Lord, and thy truth is about thee.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea; thou stillest the waues therof when they doe arise.
Thou onelie art of power to resolue into vapors the drops of the sea by the heate of the sunne; thou takest the same vp being turned into airie substance, and againe turnest it into meere water, and makest it to come pouring downe vpon the face of the earth.
Whatsoeuer thou wilt thou dost in heauen and in earth, and in the sea, and in al deepe places.
With thy power thou madest the earth with thy wisedome thou hast established the world, and with thy discretion stretched out the heauens.
Assoone as thou lettest thy voice be heard the waters in the aire waxe fierce, thou drawest vp the cloudes from the ends of the earth; thou turnest the lightening into raine, and bringest foorth the winde out of thy treasures: thou couerest the heauens with clouds and preparest raine for the earth; thou makest the grasse to growe vpon the mountaines, and prouidest herbes for the vse of man; thou giuest to beasts their foode, and to the yong rauens that crie.
Behold, so great art thou that thou passest our knowledge, neither can the nomber of thy yeres be searched out.
When thou restrainest the drops of water, the raine poureth downe by the vapors thereof, and falleth abundantlie vpon man.
Thou bringest forth the windes out of thy treasures that is from the secret places where thou didst hide them in great abundance, that they might be readie at thy commandement, and come forth when thou thinkest good.
Thou makest the cloudes to labor to giue water to the earth and scatterest the cloude of thy light.
Thou turnest it about by thy gouernment, that they may doe whatsoeuer thou commandest them vpon the whole world.
God, mine hart is trobled very sore when beholde the immoderate showers, and heare the terrible thunder, yea it forsaketh his place, when heare the noise of thy voice, and the speech proceeding from thy mouth.
God, which rulest heauen and earth, most humblie beseech thee, mercifullie to driue awaie, or at least to mittigate these mightie streames, and most raging tempests.
Restraine the thunderbolts, and thy fierie darts that they hurt vs not.
Keepe vs, and our nestes that we perish not through lightenings, nor be destroied by thy thunderclaps.
Protect our houses vs that we be neither consumed by thy firie meteor, nor be drowned by any suddaine flood.
merciful God, raine not, beseech thee, hailestones vpon the face of the earth, neither strike such as are in the fieldes be they man or beast
Strike not thou therewithal the herbes of the fielde, neither breake thou, gracious Lord, the trees of our lande.
Destroie not our corne with hailestones: nor with hailestones smite thou our cattel and deliuer our flocks from the thunderbolt.
Cast not the fiercenes of thy wrath, anger, and displeasure, vpon vs. Giue vs not hailestones for raine neither flames of fire in our lande: but of thy mercie conuert the thunder into gentle raine, whereby it may bring out fruite abundantlie
Sende not among vs either vntimelie, or vntemperate showers which be either noisome to the fruite, and bring the mildewe or destroie the corne.
Restraine in like sort the windes and violent tempestes, that they bring none hurt neither to vs, or our goods, euen for Christes sake our Lorde, and Sauior, Amen.
Almightie, eternal, and liuing God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, thanke thee with mine· whole hart for sending of thine infinite and vnspeakeable goodnes to manwarde, thine onelie Sonne into this worlde to suffer on our behalfe al the miseries of this life: which in the state of extreeme basenes traueling from one region to another, to preach the Gospel of thy kingdome, suffered no doubt the sondrie infirmities of our mortal bodie.
For passing through Samaria he was wearie by reason of trauel, and rested himselfe on Iacobs wel
For we haue not an hie Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in al things tempted like as we are, and yet without sinne.
In his Name take my iournie whose wil it is that whatsoeuer we doe either in worde or deede, we shoulde doe it in the Name of our Lorde and Sauior Christ, giuing thanks vnto thee our God, and Father through him.
For his sake, which went about doing good and healing al that were oppressed of Satan, beseech thee, giue thine holie angels charge to keepe me in al my waies, and to guide me to and fro in my iournie, euen as Tobie the yonger was guided of the Angel Raphaël vnto Gabaël habiting in Rages a citie of the Medes.
Guide me with strength and courage; and direct my steps in the course of my iournie, that wander not out of the right waie into bywaies, neither cast my selfe into dangers.
And therefore, holie Father, be thou the directer of my waies, and keepe me out of the clawes of spoilers.
Compasse me about with thine heauenlie protection, that fal not into any euils either of soule, or bodie.
Be thou vnto me a faithful companion as thou wast to Iacob the Patriarch traueling into Mesopotamia, and descending into Egypt
Likewise as thou diddest lead the children of Israël through the red sea and through the vncomfortable wildernes going before them by daie in a piller of a cloude and by night in a piller of fire to lighten them in the way that they went: vouchsafe to accompanie, gouerne, and direct me in this my iornie.
Shew mee also such fauor, that wheresoeuer go may find godlie men, which may entertaine, lodge, and curteouslie entreate me least otherwise fal into perils, and be iniuried of the wicked.
Be thou with me night and daie, that none hurt light vpon me; protect me both against the iniurie of cold, and the vehemencie of heat and from al enimies deliuer me.
Lord, giue me bread to eate and clothes to put on.
And as the wise men by the direction of a star in the East came ioiefullie into Iurie, and afterward being admonished in a dreame so to doe, returned into their countrie another waie: so my busines being wel finished bring me home againe in safetie, that may praise thee my God, and Lorde, continuallie in the Congregation of thy Saints.
Lorde heare my praier and with thine eares consider my complaint; holde not thy peace at my teares.
For am a stranger in this worlde, as al my forefathers were.
Our daies like a shadowe vpon the earth doe passe awaie, and continue not.
We are strangers, and wander out of our true countrie
For the daies of our pilgrimage are but short yet be they full of miserie troble.
Giue me grace that set not my minde on this worlde, but to lift vp mine eies vnto heauen, and desire a better that is, an heauenlie countrie.
And as long as wee are absent from the bodie let vs be of good courage; suffer vs not through feare to faint in afflictions, but firmelie to trust that shortlie we shal returne vnto thine habitation, and there enioy thy sight in deede, euerlasting life, where thou, with thy Sonne, and the holie Spirit, liuest, and raignest one eternal God for euermore, Amen.
Iesu Christ, holie, and eternal God, miserable man, and wretched sinner acknowledge confesse, that am not worthie the least of al thy mercies most vnworthie to receaue thee vnder the roofe of my soule by participating of thy most blessed bodie and blood.
For horrible and infinite are the sinnes wherwith am defiled.
Wo is me, Lord, for am a man of polluted lips, and dwel among people that haue vncleane lips.
And therefore the verie entrales of mine hart are trobled, and my bones doe shake, because finde my soule a most vnworthie ghest for so heauenlie a supper.
And yet againe mine hart is wonderfullie lightened when cal into minde that thou, the deere sonne of almightie God, camest not into this worlde to cal the righteous but sinners vnto repentance.
For they that be whole neede not the Phisition, but they that are sick.
Besides, knowe right wel, and constantlie doe beleeue, that notwithstanding my filthines, thou canst make me worthy, which alone canst make that cleane, which is conceaued of vncleane seede and righteous men of sinners when thou forgiuest our sins of thy wonted grace, thine holie Spirit being poured vpon vs. Through which thy power and mercie, beseech thee, grant such grace vnto me a sinner, that may worthilie approch to this heauenlie Sacrament, least otherwise by mine vnworthines be made guiltie of thy bodie and blood, and so in+stead of life receaue my iudgement and condemnation.
Giue grace therefore, that afore presume to come vnto the participation thereof, may examine my selfe by calling my sinnes into minde, searching out my waies by vnfained and hartie repentance returning vnto thee my Lord, least otherwise by concealing my sinnes, with Iudas the traitor eate the bread of the Lord against the Lord by abusing thy gentlenes heape vengeance vpon my selfe against the daie of vengeance.
Make me to confesse my sinnes, and that with hartie sobs, so thou being a faithful and iust God wilt pardon al mine offences, clense me from my sinnes: and wilt not disdaine to accept me into fauor, when doe not refraine to acknowledge my wickednes.
Moreouer, poure into me a true and liuelie faith, that neuer mistrust thy worde annexed to the Sacraments, which promiseth vnto mankinde the remission of sinnes.
For to eate, or drinke with the mouth onelie is to no purpose, but faith must come therevnto, and apprehende the worde with the promises annexed.
For they are the groundes and principles of this sacrament.
So that whosoeuer giueth credit to these words, Which was giuen, and shed for you, in the remission of sinnes the same man hath that which is promised by them, namelie, eternal life, and saluation.
For where the remission of sinnes is, there likewise righteousnes, life, and saluation is.
But he which doubteth of these wordes, he without doubt is an vnworthie receiuer, and commeth vnprepared.
For the doubting man neither eateth thy flesh spirituallie, nor yet drinketh thy blood, though carnally, and to our eies he seemeth to consume the sacrament of thy bodie and blood with his teeth and mouth, but his damnation rather.
Not because thy supper is poyson, but for that an euil man taketh a good thing naughtilie.
Finallie, also grant, that receiuing this thy Sacrament of the newe Testament, may put of, according to the former conuersation, the old man which is corrupt according to the lusts of error, and be renued in the spirit of my minde, putting on the newe man which after God, is created in righteousnes, and holines of truth.
And albeit my nature be such, that cannot liue without spots of wickednes yet so blesse me, that may neuer offende willinglie, but altogither depending vpon thy goodnes, whose manner is to pardon the true penitent sinners, may boldelie approch to thine holie supper.
Especiallie, seeing we haue libertie to enter into the holie place through the blood by the newe and liuing way which thou hast prepared for vs through the vaile, that is, by thy flesh.
And seeing we haue an high Priest ouer the house of God, make vs to draw nigh with true harts, in assurance of faith, sprinkeled in our minds from an euil conscience, and washed in bodie with pure water: cause vs to holde fast the profession of our hope without wauering (for he is faithful that promised) and let vs consider one of another, to prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes, not forsaking the assemblie of the faithful, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as we see the daie approching, Amen.
Christ the onelie mediator betweene God and man which of thine ardent and vnspeakeable good wil tookest our flesh vpon thee, to become a sacrifice and raunsome for al mankinde: and for the better conceauing of that thy benefit didst ordaine before thy paineful passion, a perpetual memorie of thy loue, and that by erecting a couenant of the newe Testament which testifieth of thy presence, merite, power, and mercie, washing awaie dailie the sinnes of beleeuers: And the more effectuallie to co~mend the depenes of this mysterie, didst ordaine this Sacrament in thy last supper being euen readie to go fro~ thy Disciples vnto thy passio~, the more depelie to fixe it in our harts, that it neuer slip out of our minds, but dailie in faith, feare, and reuerence, be recorded; and remaine according to thine holie institution, whole and perfect without adding or diminishing from the same.
For though it be but a mans testament yet if it be confirmed and prooued by the death of the testator, no man diminisheth or addeth therevnto.
Vnto thee doe crie, Sonne of God, which art partaker of our flesh, and bone of our bones, beseeching thee from the bottome of mine hart, that it woulde please thee to giue me grace that with an earnest desire, and due reuerence may couet to receaue thy supper, and therin thirstinglie to seeke for the nourishment of my soule.
Remooue from mine hart al loathing, contempt, and curiositie of prophane men, which, set the~selues against thee, and proudlie despise this thine institution, like vnto dogs despising holie things and vnto hogs treading most precious pearls vnder their feete.
Lift vp my minde, that in feare and trembling, in faith and spiritual comfort, may approch to the worthie receiuing of thy precious bodie and blood, not as hypocrites doe, which hide and dissemble their sinnes; neither as epicures despising both thee and thine holie ordinance.
And therefore stir vp in me an vnfained desire of this heauenlie nourishment, that from thee the bread of life and fountaine of saluation, may draw vital iuice to the quickning of my soule.
In which communion thou bestowest vpon beleeuers both the merits of thine obedience and passion, and also thine other benefits whatsoeuer.
Besides inwardlie thou dost replenish vs with newe and celestial ioie, in quickening, comforting, teaching and gouerning vs, that so we may haue and get our strength fro~ thee euen as the branches drawe their iuice and force to fructifie, from the vine.
Lighten therefore the eies of mine hart, that may knowe what the hope is wherevnto we are called and what the riches of our inheritance are in the Saints and what exceeding greatnes of thy power and mercie is hid in this supper, and how vnspeakable be the riches of the glorie of this Sacrament, whereby thou communicatest to al and ech of thy faithful together with thy bodie and blood al the treasures of thine heauenlie goodes to be receaued by faith.
For thine holie and blessed mouth hath saide: am the bread of life which came downe from heauen, he which commeth to mee shal not hunger in any wise, and he that beleeueth on mee shal neuer thirst.
And the bread which shal giue, is my flesh, which wil giue for the life of the world.
most sweete bread heale thou the palate of mine hart, that may taste the sweetnes of thy loue; heale me of al mine infirmities, that delight in no fairenes besides thee.
most heauenlie whight bread containing within thee al comfort, and the perfect sweetenes of al sauor, which doest alwaies refresh vs, let mine hart eate thee, and with thy pleasant sauor let al the bowels of my flesh be replenished.
thou bread of life, which camst downe from heauen, and giuest life to the world, come into mine hart, and purge me from al filthines of the flesh and spirit: enter thou into my soule, heale, and sanctifie mee both within and without.
Be thou the buckler, and perpetual defence of my soule and dodie, that may come vnto thy kingdome the right waie, where we shal not deale with mysteries as in this worlde, but shal beholde thee face to face, when thou hast deliuered the kingdome to God the Father, and so God shal be al in al, Amen.
Iesu, high and eternal Priest sitting on the right hande of the throne of maiestie in the heauens, gouernor of the Saints, Thou art an high Priest of good things to come which by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with handes, that is to saie, not of this building, neither by the blood of goates, calues but by thine owne blood didst enter once into the holie place, and founde eternal redemption, when through the eternal spirite, thou offeredst thy selfe a pure sacrifice without spot, to God, purging our consciences from dead workes, to serue the liuing God: yeelde thee hartie thankes for suffering vpo~ the altar of the crosse a most shameful death, for our sins, and that of thine owne accorde, mooued therevnto by a singular affection of good wil towards vs.
blesse thee for instituting this Sacrament of thy bodie and blood in remembrance of our euerlasting redemptio~, that at no time it might slip out of our minds, but be an holie signe, and testimonie of thy perpetual friendship, and a seale of the confirmation of the newe and eternal couenant which thou hast entred into with vs concerning the free remission and forgiuenes of our sinnes.
magnifie thee also with al reuerence of mind, for bidding vs miserable men, and sinners both vnto the participation of thy most holie supper, and also to the receiuing of al celestial riches; wherein thou bestowest, and appliest particularlie to euerie of vs, al the merits and good things which by thine obedience and death, thou hast purchased on our behalfe, that we may become partners, and fellow heires of eternal blessednes.
sacred banket, wherin heauenlie dainties are set afore vs which reuiue the soule: and thou lambe of God, after a wonderful and mystical manner, giuest thy selfe to refresh the inwarde man.
We diminish thee not in eating thee but thou endurest whole perpetuallie.
And although the visible signes are consumed, yet canst not thou be deuoured.
Thou art the meate of the soule, not of the bodie; and fattest our minds, not our bellies.
Thou changest the eater into thy selfe, and yet art not changed into the eater, as other corporal foode is changed commonlie.
So that we participate of thy diuine nature and thou no whit art altered into our sinful flesh.
humbly beseech thee, Sonne of God, by thy most sacred blood shed for vs, giue me grace, that participating of this visible Sacrament, may withal finde and feele in mine hart the inuisible working of thine heauenlie grace, which is conteined in this mysterie; that this supper may be, as some refreshing vnto my bodie, so a special medicine of my soule.
Quicken and raise vp in me by this blessed Sacrament a continual remembrance of thy bitter passion, make me to retaine the same firmelie and fresh in my minde, and shew it foorth as an onelie and sufficient ransome of my redemption, vntil thou returnest.
Let me neuer doubt of the forgiuenes of my sinnes, which thou assurest me of by thy bodie blood, in thine holy couenant concluded in thy last supper, by the breaking of bread, and giuing foorth the cup to thy chosen Disciples, and by them to as manie as are incorporated into thy Church through Baptisme: That as often as Satan assaileth vs, with his deadlie tentations, we may runne to our sanctuarie, as it were to a strong anchor of defence, apprehending the promise ratified by the seale of this couenant, and neuer giue ouer in fight but stil be refreshed with newe virtue from aboue; nor breake our harts through the consideration of sundrie misfortunes which the vngrateful worlde by the instinct of their capitaine the Diuel, woulde bring vpon vs, but calling into minde thy death, into the which we are baptized, may escape from al calamities; So that no tribulation, nor anguish, nor persecution, neither hunger, nor nakednes, neither perils, nor sworde, neither death, neither life may separate vs from our head, wherevpon being made fast by this holie Sacrament receaued, we, as liuing members doe depende; And finallie may knowe that we are fed and refreshed by thy flesh and pretious blood, that washed therewith we should not hereafter giue our selues to carnal pleasures, nor feede vpon the leauen of malice and wickednes, but resisting them, liue in al sinceritie truth as it becommeth such as doe eate of the immaculate Paschal lambe, whose life is hid with thee but when thou shalt be reuealed, then shal we also appeare in glorie.
For this blessed meate doth truelie witnes that our bodies, sprinkled with the virtue of thy quickening flesh, as it were with celestial dewe, shal rise againe vnto immortalitie, and euerlasting glorie.
Wherefore giue grace, that al thy Saints participating of the bread of eternal life, may be replenished with the fruition of thy blessed sight for euermore in thy celestial paradise, Amen.
Thank thee, Christ lambe of God, for offering thy selfe vpon the altar of the crosse to thy father an offering and a sacrifice of a sweete smelling sauor to God, for our sinnes to reconcile vs vnto him: for certaintie whereof, and confirmation of our faith, thou hast instituted on our behalfe this holie Sacrament of thy supper; that as often as we receiue the same, we may celebrate thy memorie and with thankesgiuing remember the merite and frute of thy passion.
beseech thee by thy bitter death, stir vp our minds, that by often receiuing this thine ordinance and institution, we may consider howe bitter a death thou didst suffer on our behalfe, and how great the loue was, which draue thee to take so cruel and shameful a death to saue vs: and withal continuallie yeelde, as we are bounde, hartie thanks vnto thee for the same, and after the like sort, answere to our power, that vnspeakeable good wil by our good life, and careful obseruation of thy commandements: and may, when, either through frailetie of our flesh or by any other fault preuented, we sinne, runne by and by vnto thee by repentance, and, through consideration of this new and eternal couenant touching the remission of sinnes, made with vs, be erected and vpholden vnto a liuelie and constant hope.
sweete Iesu, grant, that, being fast linked vnto thee by this holie mysterie, may receaue power and strength from thee, beleeuing thy promises, and be wholie addicted therevnto without any doubting, that so my conscience, in feare and trobles, may haue perfect consolation.
Suffer me not to be separated from the members of thy bodie, which is the Church, whereof thou art head fulfilling al in al, but grant, that abiding in thy word and kingdome, may be without fault in the foundation, without sinne against my conscience, and walke worthie this Sacrament, forsaking vtterlie and renouncing the Diuel, and al Idolatrie, al vices and carnal desires which fight against the soule.
For we cannot be partakers of the Lordes table, and of the Diuels to
Make me also to remember that by this sacrament am bound to do good vnto others.
For as manie graines of corne do make one loafe; and manie grapes make one wine: so being manie yet are we but one loafe and one bodie, inasmuch as we al participate of one bread, and drinke of one cup.
Ioine vs therfore together, Sauior of the world, at this common banquet through the band of loue, that we may be fastened vnto thee our head.
That, as thou diddest die for vs, so we againe may not feare to suffer, and to giue our liues for the glorie of thy name, that we neuer be separated from thee, neither in life, nor death
Make vs also hartilie to loue one another like the true and liuelie members of thy bodie that, if need require, we may giue our liues for our brethren
For hee that receiueth the mysterie of vnitie and keepeth not the bond of peace, he doth not receaue the mysterie for himselfe, but a testimonie against himselfe.
Giue grace therefore, that laieng aside al wrath fiercenes, maliciousnes, and enuie, we may forgiue one another, euen as thou forgiuest vs; and beare one with another for the better auoiding of strife, difension sectes, and pernicious heresies.
Keepe this thine ordinance and right vse of thy Sacrament among vs euermore, that this good worke, and diuine ceremonie, may alwaies be a note, and badge of our publike profession, whereby we are knowne from Pagans: and tokens of loue, confession, and thankefulnes.
Remooue awaie al abuses and prophanations of this holie and sacred supper, together with the horrible and Idolatrous adorations inuented by Satan and his members, to the shameful deforming of thy godlie and goodlie institution, but maintaine humblie beseech thee, the true and vnpolluted vse thereof, til thy pleasure is to returne in the cloudes to iudgement with great power and glorie that it neuer be out of remembrance.
And last of al at our resurrection from death, appoint vs places in thy heauenlie table, where we may taste the new wine in the kingdome of thy father abiding with thine elect Angels and blessed Saintes for euermore, Amen.
Almightie and merciful God, Father of our Lord Iesu Christ, which through corporal diseases both puttest me in minde of my mortalitie, and also callest to repentance.
For thou wilt not the death of a sinner but that he conuert, and liue: Vnto thee doe crie, Lorde, rebuke me not in thine anger neither chastise me in thy wrath; haue mercie on me, Lorde, for am weake; Lorde, heale me, for my bones are vexed.
My soule is also trobled verie sore; but Lorde, how long wilt thou delaie? Returne, deliuer my soule; saue me, for thy mercies sake.
Heale me, Lord and shal be whole; saue thou me, and shal be saued: For thou art my praise.
Thou hast wounded, and thou wilt heale me; thou hast strooken, and thou wilt cure; thou dost kil, and restore to life againe.
Wherfore if this my sicknes be not vnto the death, helpe me vpon the bed of my sorow
Maie it please thee, Lorde, to deliuer me out of the myre.
For the graue wil not acknowledge thee, nor death confesse thee: but the liuing, saie the liuing wil extol thee for euermore.
Lorde, heale me, that may praise thee al my life long, through my Sauior, Amen.
Christ Iesu, Sonne of the liuing God, our Redeemer, and our Mediator for euermore, in our weake flesh thou wentest about the earth preaching the glad tydings of the kingdome touching the forgiuenes of our sinnes, and curing euerie sicknes, and euerie disease among the people.
For thou hast truelie taken vpon thee our infirmities and borne our paines.
For where sinne abounded, there thy grace did more abound
Wherfore praie, most humblie beseech thee, be merciful vnto me heale my soule.
For haue sinned against thee; strengthe~ it by the sweete comfort of thy Gospel; and confirme my faith: then, if it be thine heauenlie pleasure, restore health vnto my weake bodie.
If thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane; onelie doe but speake the worde and shal be healed.
For it is not herbes nor plasters that restore health: but thy worde, Lord, which healeth al things.
It is thou, Lord, which hast the power both of life and death; thou leadest vnto deaths doore, and bringest vp againe.
But, if it be more expedient for me to die, than to liue, then deale with me according to thy wil Lord, and commande my spirit to be receaued in peace; the which commende into thine hands thou hast redeemed me, Lord God of truth, which liuest and raignest with the Father, and the holie Ghost, one God for euermore, Amen.
Eternal God, which art ful of co~passion and mercie, slowe to anger, and great in kindnes; thou forgiuest our falts couerest our sinnes, and dost not impute our iniquities vnto vs: Vnto thee doe bende my praier, beseeching thee to pardon al my sinnes and to heale al mine infirmities.
Saue my life from destruction, and compasse me about with mercie, and louing kindnes.
For thou art the God of my saluation mine helper, in thee hath mine hart trusted.
Despise not the workes of thine owne hands neither suffer him to perish whom thou hast created, and redeemed.
Christ, lambe of God which takest awaie the sins of the world, and washest vs from al our offences by thy pretious blood encrease my faith that firmelie may apprehende the saluation promised.
Blesse thou my soule at hir departure from the bodie, that euermore may reioice with thee.
And, holie Ghost, eternal God, which art the best Comforter in al extremities, be thou present, beseech thee, at the houre of my death, and impart thy sauing health vpon me, that mine hart doe not faint, nor be trobled, Amen.
Praise and glorie, and wisedome, and thankes, and honor, and power, and might be vnto our God for euermore, Amen.

BE it from thy minde (good Reader) to thinke, that, because wee haue applied these praiers vnto certaine daies, we would therefore haue thee to tie thy selfe alwaies vnto the which wee haue prescribed, either to violate or omit the same: to doe so, we iudge it foolish, superstitious, and wicked.

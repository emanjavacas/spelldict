epigraph ecclesiastes xi
rejoyce young man in thy youth and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thy heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment

if solomon had said rejoyce not young man in thy youth neither let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth walk not in the way of thine heart nor in the sight of thine eyes for know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into iudgment the sense had been so easie and plain that there had been no appearance of difficulty in reconciling one part with the other for the whole had been look'd upon but as a necessary and seasonable admonition to such who by the heats of youth and strength of inclination and allurements of the world are too apt to be transported with the love of sensual pleasures
and this had been very becoming the wise man towards the conclusion of his book wherein he had not onely before set forth the several vanities of humane

life but so soon after bids men remember their creatour in the days of their youth

while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh of which they shall say they have no pleasure in them in the days wherein they are most apt to walk in the way of their hearts and in the sight of their eyes
for he knew very well that nothing is so powerfull a check and restraint upon mens inclinations to sin as the serious consideration of that god that gave them their beings and will bring them to an account for their actions

but how then comes he in this verse to seem rather to give a permission to young men in the time of youth to indulge themselves in their mirth and vanity rejoyce young manÂ· in thy youth

some think that the wise man onely derides and exposes them for their folly in so doing but that seems not agreeable with the grave and serious advice which follows
and we find nothing like irony or sarcasm in any part of the foregoing book for he begins it with a tragical exclamation against the vanities of humane life

vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities all

is vanity
and he pursues his argument by a particular induction of the most tempting and pleasing vanities of life and particularly all sorts of sensual delights

as mirth and iollity in the first place

then wine and musick fine palaces

curious vineyards gardens and pools a great retinue and which was needfull to maintain all this

abundance of silver and gold
but what a melancholy reflection doth he make on all these pleasures of life then looked on all the works that my hands had wrought

and on the labour that had laboured to doe and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit
what incouragement then could the wise man after so much experience of the world give to young men here in the text to rejoyce in the days of their youth and to walk in the way of their hearts and in the sight of their eyes to pursue vanity and to lay the foundation for greater vexation of spirit when they come to reflect on their own follies

what then is the meaning of these words for this we are to observe that the preacher having declared his own main scope and design in the beginning and conclusion of his book brings in sometimes the different

senses which mankind are apt to have concerning the happiness of life
and that is the reason that we meet with such different expressions concerning it

in one place it is said

that there is no better thing under the sun than to eat and drink and to be merry but in another he saith sorrow is better than laughter

and by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better

in one place he saith

all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked

but in another that it shall be well with them that fear the lord but it shall not be well with the wicked

how can such passages as these be reconciled if we look on them as expressing the sense of the same person but if we allow them to be the different notions of two sorts of men in this world they are easie to be understood although not to be reconciled
and the one sort is of those who place all happiness in this life without regard to religion or vertue or another world and the other of those who look on this life onely as a passage to another and that all persons ought to behave themselves here so as conduces most to their happiness hereafter

and according to these different schemes we have in the words of the text two very different sorts of counsel and advice to young men


the first proceeds upon the supposition that all the happiness of man lies in this life and in the enjoyment of the sensual pleasures of it rejoyce young man in thy youth and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the way of thy heart and in the sight of thy eyes
we have no other rule here given but the sight of the eye and the way of the heart outward appearance and inward inclination and these are the beloved rules of the most sensual and voluptuous persons and they judge of happiness onely by the pursuit of them
here is nothing mention'd of reason or conscience or a regard to vertue in the restraint of natural inclinations nay here is nothing of that severity which epicurus himself thought necessary towards the maintaining of a pleasant state of life which he granted could never be done without some restraint of mens appetites and inclinations to the pleasures of sense and it is not to be imagined

that solomon should give young men greater liberty than the corruptest moralists did
therefore cannot look upon these words as a permission for them to doe what is here expressed but as a full description of that method of living which the jolly and voluptuous corrupters of youth would instruct them in rejoyce young man in thy youth and let thine heart chear thee

ii
we have here the most powerfull check and restraint laid upon all these sensual inclinations of youth
but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee to iudgment
which words are the wise man's correction of the foregoing liberty or the curb which reason and religion give to the pursuit of natural inclinations wherein every word hath its force and ought to make a deep impression upon us for


know thou thine is not then the same case with creatures that have no understanding they are not capable of any check from themselves having no law of reason or conscience within them to controul or govern their sensual desires but god hath given thee not meerly a brutal

appetite but a rational soul capable of understanding the differences of good and evil and the reasons why some things which appear pleasant are very disagreeing to the principles of humane nature to that order decency modesty and regularity which the more elevated frame and capacity of mankind do require


for all these things as light and vain as you esteem them as soon as they are over and forgotten by you as secretly and closely as they are committed as much as you endeavour to palliate and excuse them yet but for all these things god will certainly bring thee into iudgment
therefore you have all the reason in the world to consider what you doe

since every thing will be brought to judgment whether it be good or evil as solomon concludes this book
which shews the great regard god hath to the good or evil of our actions and if the great judge of the world hath so certainly we ought to have it and never think our selves at liberty to doe what we please in gratifying our lusts and pursuing our natural inclinations to evil


god will doe it
if there were no god to call thee to an account yet there are some actions of vertue so agreeable to mankind and some vices so loathsome and deformed that there would be sufficient cause for them to love the one and to abhor the other
if we could suppose such a frame of things and such sorts of beings as we now see and no god to make them which is most absurd and unreasonable yet we must suppose these beings to have natures and properties distinct from each other so that we could not imagine men to become beasts and therefore they must not act like them but preserve that decorum or agreeableness in their actions which is suitable to the peculiar excellencies of humane nature
and there are some sins so much below the dignity thereof that no circumstances no suppositions can make them fitting for mankind to commit them which shews that the nature of good and evil is no arbitrary thing but is founded in the very frame of our beings and in the respects we owe to our selves and to one another
and since there is an infinite and supreme being which hath absolute power and command over us and

gives us both our beings and the comforts of our lives it is most absurd to suppose it not to be a fault to hate his goodness or to despise his mercy or to slight his power and to contemn his authority for in all these there is something repugnant to the common sense of mankind and to all principles of true honour and justice
and there are such common principles of morality arising from our necessary relation to god and each other which are of so clear and convincing evidence that every one that considers them will grant that wicked men may as well go about to dispute their beings as their sins and may as easily prove that they are not but onely appear to be as that no actions are really evil but only by false glasses appear so to be
but however vain men may deceive themselves god will not be mocked for he not onely sees and knows all our actions but he will bring us to an account for them


god will bring thee into iudgment
it is a dreadfull consideration to a sinner that god knows all his false steps all his secret sins all his falshood and dissimulation with god and men and there is nothing which

men of art and design hate more than to be discover'd and found out in all their double and deceitfull dealings but to have these not onely privately discover'd but exposed and laid open to the view of the world and not onely so but to have every circumstance examin'd and every action scanned and that by the great judge of all the world whom nothing can escape nothing can deceive nothing can withstand whose justice is inflexible whose knowledge is incomprehensible whose power is irresistible and whose vengeance is insupportable this we cannot but imagine must strike an awe and terrour into the minds of men when they are pursuing the pleasures of sin that for all these things god will bring them into judgment
but notwithstanding these and many other expressions to the same purpose in scripture wherein god hath declared that he will certainly iudge the world in righteousness at the great day

that the secrets of all hearts shall then be disclosed

that we must all appear before the of christ

and that god will render to every man according to his deeds

and notwithstanding it is a thing in it self very reasonable from the

consideration of god's justice and providence and the nature and consequences of good and evil actions yet the generality of mankind go on as secure and careless as if there were no such thing or that they ought not to be concerned about it
therefore shall not spend time in the proof of that which take for granted you all believe and am sure have reason so to doe but shall enquire into these things which are most practical and therefore proper for our consideration at this time


how a matter of so great importance as a iudgment to come makes so little impression on the minds of the generality of mankind who profess to believe it

by what means the consideration of a future judgment may have a greater influence on all our minds

how a thing of so great importance as god's bringing us into iudgment comes to make so little impression on the minds of the generality of those who profess to believe it when we are so tender and sensible of small things with respect to this world

for resolving this we must consider that

there is a great difference between the not disbelieving doctrinal points of faith and the practical improvement of them in our minds without which they remain there but as general and confused notions
thus too many who abhor being thought atheists live as if there were no god not that they deny or dispute his being or attributes but they have no regard to them in the last dictates of their minds or in the course of their actions
to go about to prove such things to be true they look on as lost labour for they do not question them but there is another thing then which we are to give an account of viz how it comes to pass that so great and so weighty doctrines being received and allowed to be true make so little impression on the generality of mankind especially this of the day of judgment of which these seem to be the main reasons


mens impatience of considering great and weighty things at a distance which cannot affect and move our senses


the bewitching and stupifying nature of present and sensual pleasures which draw off the mind from greater things and

weaken all the impressions they make upon us


a general presumption upon god's mercy towards mankind on the account of the frailty of humane nature notwithstanding the severity of his threatnings in scripture

begin with mens impatience of considering

we flatter and please our selves with the thoughts that we are intelligent and considering beings when it may be considering especially as to matters of greatest consequence is one of the things which mankind have the greatest aversion to
for generally they love to go no farther than the outsides and appearances of things and have their minds wholly possessed with false and flattering imaginations having neither truth nor consistency in them
and those who account themselves of better breeding than others are often more imposed upon than others in this way
the pomp and grandeur of the world the gaity and splendour of living strikes their fancies with such vehement impressions that scarce any thing else gets into their minds or sinks deep into them
there are many other things that seem to stand

fair in their opinion at some times but it is as they are thought serviceable to worldly greatness and honour

this after all the instructions of philosophers the declamations of heathen and christian orators and the far more powerfull arguments of the wisest and best of men recorded in holy scripture is still the great idol of mankind which they serve and worship with the truest and warmest devotion
all other things how great and weighty soever in themselves yet are really look'd on by them as a sort of metaphysical abstracted notions of things invisible and immaterial quite out of the reach of their imagination which may serve for the amusement of some and the affrightment of others and the entertainment of speculative minds but how to raise themselves in the world to appear great and have many dependents to pursue and carry on their own interests though without regard to justice and honesty these they account great and noble things and fit to employ their minds upon
but alas how much are such imposed upon by meer shews and appearances of things which are really what

god made them but are not what we fansie them to be there are no doubt real conveniencies of life in riches and honour and ease and plenty or else they could never be esteemed blessings nor could we have reason to thank god for them but there is a great difference between the fitness of things for our present use and for our happiness when we make them our end and do not employ them in order to a farther end
but it is good advice of paul vsing the world as not abusing it

for the fashion of this world passeth away it passes like a ship under sail while the generality of mankind like passengers lie asleep in it
sometimes when storms arise or waves cross them they seem to be awake and to look about them and to think whither they are going but those thoughts being uneasie to them they lie down again and are carried they know not whither
but still it is but the fashion of this world a meer landskip wherein there is great variety but little satisfaction the shew far the substance
when the devil shewed christ the kingdoms of the world

and the glory of them the highest mountain could afford but

a small prospect of them but as some think he caused a representation in the air of the most tempting splendour and glories of them
and this was the truest representation of them by glorious appearances and bewitching shews
but unless there be something in humane nature which makes it very apt to be deceived by such things it were strange the devil should think to prevail on our saviour by them
we pity those who travelling in the night are deceived by false fires and shining meteors and follow them into bogs and precipices but the case of such is so much worse who are deluded by the deceitfull vanities of this world to their own destruction

and can there be any greater argument of the want of consideration than for persons to suffer themselves to be so easily and so fatally cheated it is a wise observation of aristotle

that true knowledge and wisedom lies most in settling and fixing the mind
for it is not the subtlety and fineness of thoughts not the quickness and sharpness of apprehension not the close and mathematical deductions of reason which make a wise man but the having a calm and composed

temper of mind the subduing our passions and governing our actions with respect to our chief end
and in order to this consideration is absolutely necessary without which that which is nearest to us and offers it self first to our choice must prevail upon us
and here lies the main difficulty to perswade mankind to choose a far greater happiness at a distance and invisible before a present enjoyment of things we are constantly conversant with and have made an early impression upon us
but still we say that it is nothing but mens impatience of considering which makes them have so little regard to another life
for if they would but lay both worlds in the balance one against the other they would soon discover the wonderfull folly of preferring that which this world accounts happiness before that which is offered to our choice in another
for let us make all the fair and reasonable allowances that may be as to our inclinations and appetites and circumstances in this world as to the distance obscurity incomprehensibleness of the joys of another world yet every considering man that regards true happiness will be sure to chuse that which is to come
for


supposing the happiness were equal yet there is no proportion in the continuance of them and a considering man will be sure to choose a happiness that can never have an end before one that may be irrecoverably lost in a moment and can certainly be enjoyed but for a little time if there were any certainty at all in the enjoyment of it


the more any have considered the more they have repented placing too much of their happiness here because reason and experience shews them the folly of it
but the more they have considered the better satisfied the minds of good men are in placing their happiness above where alone that good is to be found which can make us truly happy and is to be enjoyed in that fulness that purity that certainty which makes it fit for the wisest and most considering men to prefer above a present happiness if it were to be enjoyed on earth


he that looks after a future happiness doth not thereby lose any of the real conveniencies of humane life but he that places his happiness here cannot find it in this world and is sure to be miserable in

another and this makes a very considerable difference in the choice
indeed if god made it absolutely necessary in order to future happiness for us to forgoe all the natural pleasures and innocent delights of this life the terms would be much harder and hardly possible to humane nature
for if all pleasures of sense must be renounced we must not see the pleasing varieties of nature nor hear the melodious sound of birds nor tast the meat when we are hungry nor drink when we are thirsty for there is really greater pleasure of sense when nature craves necessary sustenance than what the most voluptuous epicurean enjoys in all his contrivances first to raise his appetite and then to please it for what is most natural and necessary is the most delightfull every thing of force must have something vneasie in it
but god hath not dealt thus hardly with mankind he allows us all the reasonable desires of nature and hath onely forbid us what is unreasonable and unnecessary
and upon the forbearance of what is so joyned with our entire dependence upon himself for it

which the scripture calls faith working by love he hath made the gracious offer of

eternal happiness
it is true in extraordinary cases of persecution he requires more but then he proposes extraordinary rewards to make abundant recompence for them but in the common and ordinary case of mankind he requires no more than our avoiding those excesses in pleasing our appetites which nature and reason condemn
and those who consider cannot but see how unreasonable it is to place their happiness in forbidden pleasures and to think that nothing can make them happy but what god hath declared shall make them miserable
it is a strange crossness in our desires if nothing can please them but what displeases god
it were no hard task to shew that god forbids nothing but what is really repugnant to our here and how then can any such thing as happiness be hoped for in such things and when a man ventures being miserable for ever for what can never make him happy here if he had his full liberty to pursue his desires he shews how far he is from acting like a wise rational considering being
so that impatience of considering is one great reason why the thoughts of a judgment to come make so little impression on mens minds


the second reason is the bewitching and stupifying nature of sensual pleasures
the epicurean philosophers who managed the theory of pleasure with the greatest art so as it might look like a proper happiness for mankind found two things absolutely necessary in order to it


the retrenching all inordinate desires viz such as had more pain following them than there was pleasure in the enjoyment of them

the removing the fears of another world out of mens minds
for as long as these sunk into their minds they must rob them of that inward tranquillity without which it were a vain thing so much as to talk of happiness
but it was impossible upon their grounds to doe either of these
for


it is unreasonable to suppose that the happiness of our present life should consist in the enjoyment of pleasure and yet the pleasure of opinion to be taken away since the pleasure of opinion is the far greatest part of the pleasure of life and that which is as much valued and esteemed by all those who place their happiness in pleasure
if it were all to be reduced to that which lies in satisfying

the necessary desires of nature then such as have just enough for that are far more happy than the rich and voluptuous because they have less pains and care
but if any allowance be made to the pleasure of fancy and opinion then no stop can be given to inordinate desires
for who can set bounds to fancy or lay a reasonable restraint upon desires if the differences of good and evil be taken away as they must be if meer pleasure and pain be to be regarded in our actions


as to the other the methods they used to remove all fears of another world were weak and trifling and they had no advantage in point of argument but what the ignorance and folly of the idolatrous part of mankind at that time gave them
but there is a far greater advantage in point of interest which makes men of sensual lives very willing to be rid of the fears of another life
and a willing mind goes a great way in believing or not believing
those who place their happiness in eating and drinking well as they call it and other sensual delights which can never be enjoyed when htis life is ended have but a melancholy

prospect into another world for they are shut out from the very possibility of being happy in their own sense unless they would believe the eastern impostour but when they once come to apprehend that there is no pleasure to make them happy but what is seated in the body they are apt to conclude that when that dies there is an end of all for their imaginations can reach no farther
and the true reason is they have laid reason and conscience asleep so long that it is very hard to awaken them their notions of good and evil are like the confused apprehensions of men half awake they see enough to perplex but not enough to satisfie them
and when their fears grow upon them they have not the heart and courage to examine them whether they be reasonable or not but rather choose to return to their former opiates than undergo the trouble of an effectual cure by a hearty repentance and coming to themselves

as the prodigal son in the parable did when his hardship had brought him to consideration
we do not know what had become of him if he had been wise and frugal in his pleasures if he had taken care of a good stock and a

plentifull subsistence but he first came to be pinched with want before he was awakened to repent
but we have in scripture a more remarkable instance of the stupifying nature of sensual pleasures and that was in david after his sins of adultery and murther
it is a wonder how a man of such a tender conscience in other things should continue so long under the guilt of these enormities without being awakened to repentance did he not know these to be great sins and did not his conscience charge him with the guilt of them how came he then to need a prophet to be sent to him and to deal so plainly with him as to tell him thou art the man

but this is a plain evidence how much the pleasures of sin are apt to stupifie mens consciences so far that unless god by his grace be pleased to awaken them thoroughly they never come to a sincere and hearty repentance
david saw nothing more as to the guilt of his sins when he penn'd his psalm than his own reason and natural conscience might inform him before but he had quite another sense of his sins then his heart was broken and his soul wounded under

the apprehension of god's displeasure and this makes him pray so earnestly and so importunately to god for the pardon of his sins
and if it were thus in the case of a man otherwise after god's own heart i.e afraid of offending him and carefull to please him what may we imagine it to be in those who in the time of youth walk in the way of their hearts and in the sight of their eyes allowing themselves in all sensual inclinations and pursuing carnal delights so far till they have lost all sense of god and another world and such as these nothing but the powerfull influences of divine grace can awaken and recover


the third reason is a general presumption upon god's mercy
the first thing which sinners in the heat of their youth and pursuit of their lusts aim at is to think as little as may be of what they are doing or what will be the consequence of their actions
for every thought of themselves is very uneasie to them and every thought of god is much more so therefore they drive away all such thoughts by one means or other by sleep diversion company and such publick entertainments as

rather heighten and inflame their vices than correct them

if all this will not doe but there will be some melancholy hours wherein conscience begins to rouse it self and to awaken the sinner to some sense of his folly then he is ready to hearken with pleasure to any raileries against religion and morality and admires the wit of any one who dares say a bold and sharp thing against the wisdom of all ages and of the best men in them
and one or two such sayings without proof are cried up as far beyond the best rules of morality or the evidence of natural and revealed religion
any sceptical disputes are sufficient demonstrations to them and the most unreasonable cavils against religion are embraced because against the thing they hate and even a jest against the day of judgment shall signifie more with them than the strongest arguments in the world to prove it
the true reason is they love their vices and hate every thing which makes them uneasie to them and nothing doth more so than the thoughts of a judgment to come

but suppose after all the terrible and frequent expressions of scripture concerning the day of judgment joyned with the reasonableness of the thing do make such impression on their minds that they cannot wholly shake off the fears and apprehensions of it then their last endeavour is to mitigate and lessen them from a general presumption of god's mercifull nature and therefore they are willing to suppose that however god to keep the world in awe hath threatned them with the dreadfull severities of the great day yet as a tender father who threatens his disobedient son in order to reclaim him with no less than disinheriting him for ever yet when it comes to execution he may relent not from his sons deserts but his own compassion so they hope or believe or are willing to doe so that god at the great day will not proceed according to the rigour which he hath threatned to use
and to comfort themselves in these hopes they find out all possible extenuations of their sins if we say they had been created purely intellectual beings free from this load of flesh and the inclinations which are natural to it then it had been more reasonable to have called us to a strict account for every

action of our lives for then every inclination to evil must have come from our minds but now our bodies corrupt and draw them aside and the inclinations to evil grow faster than our reason which should check and restrain them
and when those inclinations are strongest men have not that judgment which is necessary to the government of unruly passions
so that the very frame of humane nature seems to plead for sins committed in the heat and violence of youth
besides such is the strictness and purity of the law of god and so great the weakness and disability the ignorance and inadvertency of mankind that if god will make no allowance for humane frailty who can stand before his tribunal and if any allowance be made for sins of infirmity there are so many abatements to be made for sins committed through sudden passion through mistake through the unavoidable impotency of humane nature in this degenerate condition that the severity of that day is not much to be feared

this is the utmost of the sinners plea against the severity of the day of judgment

but to shew how faulty it is shall offer these considerations


that god will certainly iudge the world in righteousness

and therefore none shall have cause to complain of the harshness or severity of his proceedings
for this righteousness is not the rigour of justice but that equity which hath a regard to the circumstances of actions and the abatement and extenuation of faults which arise from them


none shall suffer at that day but for their wilfull impenitency and obstinate continuance in sin
for this is not onely agreeable to the mercifull nature of god to forgive repenting sinners but it is one of the great designs of the gospel to assure mankind of it by the highest testimonies even by the death and resurrection of the son of god and all the miracles wrought in confirmation of it and of the truth of his doctrine


there are several degrees of wilfulness and obstinacy and mens judgment shall be according to them
some mens capacities opportunities and helps have very much exceeded others some have broken through stronger convictions and more powerfull assistences of grace than others some have

had more early instructions more frequent warnings more obliging favours from heaven than others
and as it is reasonable that persons suffer for their obstinate continuance in sin so that they should suffer according to the degrees and circumstances of it


it is not unjust severity in god to deprive men of that happiness which they have wilfully refused and to condemn them to that misery which their sins have deserved
hath not god made the most condescending offer of mercy and salvation that it is possible for creatures to expect from him after so many and great provocations could heaven stoop lower than it hath done to vile and ungratefull sinners when the son of god came down from heaven on purpose to reconcile god and man together when the spirit of god warns and excites their minds to the consideration of their eternal welfare when the messengers of this reconciliation are to woo and intreat and beseech sinners in christ's stead as though god did beseech them by them that they would be reconciled to god when the patience and goodness and of god is exercised so much on purpose to lead

them to repentance when god instead of perfect obedience is willing to pardon and pass by so many offences if they truly repent of them and to receive them still into his favour and mercy when after all this men do rather prefer the present pleasures of sin before all that happiness which god so freely offers is it any injustice in him to suffer them for ever to be deprived of that which they so wilfully so ungratefully so obstinately refused and supposing the souls of men to subsist in another world free from all those clouds of errour and mistake and the false notions they are deceived by here as well as all the diversions and pleasures of this life it is not to be imagined but they must suffer an intolerable anguish within called

a worm that never dyes and a fire that never goes out from the reflexions upon their own folly
what vengeance beyond this god may inflict we now know not may none of us ever know it but we are sure it will never exceed the proportion and desert of their sins
which is sufficient to clear the justice of god in his proceedings with mankind in the day of judgment


it remains now onely to shew by what means god's bringing us to judgment may

make a deeper impression upon our minds by considering two things


that our not considering it will not make our condition but much worse

that our considering it is the best means to prevent the evil consequences of it


our not considering it will not make our condition better
there were great reason indeed to walk in the way of our hearts and in the sight of our eyes and never trouble our selves with what will happen at the great day if the putting it out of our heads would make our accounts the easier when it comes
but alas whether we think of it or no the account runs on and we must answer to every particular at last and how unprovided shall we be if we spend no time here in examining stating and clearing of them as far as we are able
it is a mighty priviledge we have by the gospel that god allows us to clear our accounts with him in this world

for if we would judge our selves we shall not be judged i.e
if we call our selves to a strict account for our actions if we repent heartily and sincerely of our sins if we seek earnestly to god for mercy if we have our consciences cleansed by the blood of christ from the pollution of our sins then we may

with joy and peace in our minds think of the great day of recompence
but if we never enter into our selves to search and examine our own actions never look into the habits of our own minds nor charge our selves with the guilt of the sins we have committed how can we ever hope to escape the scrutiny or avoid the severity of that day for our account continually increases by our neglect of it and the burden of god's wrath must be so much heavier when we have taken no care to lessen it but after our hardness and impenitent hearts have onely treasured up wrath against the day of wrath


our considering that god will bring us to judgment is the best means to prevent the evil consequences of it
for although we cannot hope to plead innocency yet which is next in point of wisdom this is the most effectual motive to bring us to repentance and that which makes us repent makes us to grow wise in time and to lay a good foundation for eternal life
there are many arguments to induce us to it in the folly and shame of our sins the wisdom of reflection and reformation the instances of it and exhortations to it recorded in scripture but there is none more

sensible and which touches men more in point of interest and concernment than this of a iudgment to come
must then saith a penitent sinner give a strict account to god of all the evil actions of my life and suffer according to the desert of them if die in impenitency how much doth it then concern me to repent betimes to repent in good earnest to repent while there is hopes of mercy away then all ye deceitfull vanities of this wicked world ye have too long deceived and seduced me what will all this vain shew this busie seducer this impertinent outside of the world signifie when must be stript of all and stand guilty and accused by my own conscience before the of christ oh how wretched shall be if my conscience condemns me before the sentence of the judge therefore am resolved to prevent the judgment of that day will accuse judge and condemn my self nay will proceed to execution as to all the vitious habits and corrupt inclinations within me
and although cannot wholly mortifie them yet will crucifie them nail them to the cross and allow them no longer liberty

and albeit they may struggle for a time yet will never give way to their dominion over me any more that so death and judgment may find me prepared if not with unspotted innocency yet with hearty and sincere repentance

to conclude all let the consideration of this day of iudgment to come enter deep into our minds and awaken us out of our lethargy and security
we are very apt to put off unpleasing things from time to time and to pass away our time here as easily as may be
but this is no part of wisdom and we shall extremely blame our selves for it one time or other
the best we can do now is to recover what is past by repentance and to set our selves to the making up our accounts with god in this world for we are all walking on the brink of eternity and know not how soon we may drop into it
but what eternal horrour and confusion must follow us if we go on to slight the opportunities he still affords us of making our peace with him who is to be our judge may god therefore of his mercy awaken us all to a timely and serious repentance and then our iniquities shall not be our ruine
finis

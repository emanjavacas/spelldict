quod christopher vvilson

some hope you sée the more pitie not in the lorde of might whose harts and mynd his wayes should fynd to prayse him day and night

with hart and voyce they should reioyce onely in christ say and not to hope to sée the pope with his lawes to beare sway

lament doe here to sée nowe the ioyes that some be in wyshyng for masse say alas the cloke of filthy sin

may here write and truth endite affyrme plainely and say the worde of truth the more is ruth is sowne in stonie way

for all teachyng and true preachyng some harts be hard as stéele there is no way their harts to stay or cause them truth to séele

but stoute they be in all poperie as by this man doth séente whose shamelesse face put forth this case and bad his neighbours deme

where best should be to make quod he an aulter for our masse let vs first be herein quod he it wyll thus come to passe

this fréend of popes offred ten grotes this aulter there to make where masse should be
haue here quod he this money mine here take

lorde our quéene saue we cry and craue in godlie state alway defend her grace long time and space emong vs here we pray

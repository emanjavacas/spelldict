precious hearts

confess am engaged in low and fruitless contreversies against which find a reluctancy in my spirit because they tend not so much to edification as could be wished but as am bound to vindicate the lowess truth from the find aspersions and false calumniations of satan and his instruments so daily god that low things are most beneficial for beleevers of lowest attainments and what have done in this is for their sakes who came out of aegypt out of babylon but the other day am unwilling they should be carried captives back again or that those who dearly see the doors opened to them should be any longer kept in bondage
many weak ones have stumbled at what mr lightfoot hath spoken and written though there be neither divinity nor reason it

never intended this answer of mine should have come to a plick censure had not mr lightfoot and his unholy communic dealt deceifully that say not dishonestly with me in breaking some sentences and taking up such pieces of them as they conc might bring the truth and my person into contempt and disgrace possessing people at home and abroad that wrong and abuse him whilst be shame fully conceals my whole answer together with the true intent and meaning of those innocent expressions he and they so much cry out upon
wrong be shall have none if shame he may thank himself
most of you sufficiently know how patiently have born wish him hither to and my own conscience tells me the truth hath suffered too much through my forbearance and
he hath had his time to insult over caluminiate reproach and belye it reporting whatsoever be pleased touching my answer to his paper insomuch that no any ungodly ones immediately to blaspheming railing and trampling upon the truth as though it had been quite conquered
and although rabshekeh railings make no breaches in walls yet many weak christains seeing only a few unchristianly in smal bits of paper and not knowning how little judas his receiving or not receiving doth either advantage or disadvartage a communion of saints were abundantly discouraged and bunded downs their necks that the whore which sits on many warers might go over
and now hope it is high time for me to speak in vindication of the truth and for satisfaction of such as are so easily serupled by false reports and ready upon every summons from satan ro deliver up their strong holds not knowing they have on every side salvation for walls and bulwarks and to publish my answer most unfaithfully dealt withal by mr lightfoot that ye may see it and then judg righteously between me or rather the truth and him
and would intreat those into whose hands this may come to turn unto the scriptures quoted which hope will not be and strictly to examine them and then to judg impartially crave no savour at the hands of any man hough this piece was never cut out for the publique vion let me see my errata's and shall endeavor to correct and amind them

my antagonist takes great exceptions at a epistle

intended only for himself and some few friends for had no thoughts of printing then and is conceited that have exceedingly wronged him in it all the right can do him is not to insert it here and though am able to make good every jot and tittle of it for the future to bury it in the abiss of oblivion if so be am not enforced by his unjust clamours and exotick constructions put upon it to send it with a large comment upon it after this

all the exceptions he makes so far forth as can learn either from himself or others against the particulars of my answer are so frivolous and groundless that he durst not give them under his own hand much less publish them to the world and therefore may very well pass them by but yet must needs vindicate the last particular in the close of all against which he hath draws up a charge of high crimis and misdemeanors good friends and readers turn to it is begins thus that should wrong him if should not rank him amongst the vilest in the kingdom for with them for this must pay dearly saith he and his prophane fellow members but were not a mad man and might not deservedly incur the name or title of a schismatick should make a breach in his church in his communion and for this he calls me twenty fools and mad man
but work a while and you shall see the food the mad man as well as the whetstone will fall to his share
he would perswade people or some others for him that there in that place make him a drunkard a thief a murderer and why may be not as well perswade them make him a whore the business is in deed and in truth thus all that are in or communion with him are in a scripture sence his brethren and sisters
and this dare say can prove against all the devils in hell by almost if not all out or above an hundred scriptures no man that hath not a forehead of brass or iron can deny it
have beside the scripture reason and the consent of most divines whether episcopal presbyterial independent or by what soever they are called or distinguished on my side if any shall deny it they must disclaim their own principles or tenets
the very book of called all the men in all parishes throughout england and wales dearly beloved brethren
know all men of judgments all the kingdom over will vote it in the affirmative

but am content the matter should be tryed at the tri of his own conscience if yet is be not seared with a hot iron

so then as long as be will walk in fellowship or communion with prophane wicked loose men and women as members of the saw external visible body of chirst the church with himself they must and shall be his brethren and sisters for to say will in church fellowship or communion with such and such men and women and yet they shall not be my brethren and sisters is an absierd idle vain foclish irrational contradictory assertion tis to say and unsay and in plain english to say just nothing at all
and for those that have been hanged at tyburn unless can prove that they were not by raptism admitted into his church nor be into theirs or that they were first excommunicated which be shall never do and besides let him but once mention excemunication with approbation and his cause is utterly lost or less he will eat his own words deny a national church in so gross a sence as one or joyn with us in order to a reformation let him fret and fue huff and and storm call and miss while will they must and shall be his brethren tis he made them so not therefore let none he offended with me he that communion he for the bonds of this will be loosed and not before
confess was once of this my self but now abhor and loath it and yet look upon all men whatsoever as my brethren in this sence viz as we are the off spring of and have dependency upon the same eternal being acts
he is willing such at judas was should be his and do drunkards murderers lyars exed judas in wickedness he is called a devil john
and we such worse then devils behold then a communion of then devils
what are the ends of the mans arguings wish be would declare them to us
but to hasten to a period the men in england professing faith in christ shall be his brethren but it vexeth him to the heart they should be called so

whereas he abroad that grant judas received as though he had obtained his end as doubt not but all antions men will smile at his folly so for satisfaction of the lowest capacities

amongst am willing to say again tis not proved it or ever will whilst he liveth because he shall not say what contend for viz a communion of saints upon judas his receiving or not receiving admit he did in granted say yet that doth not in the least measure advantege his or prejudice my cause him draw his inferences

when he gives be could quickly be reled to unto he acknowledgeth the difference in affection is only on his part and be speaks most truly for am willing to have the love of all man and to live peaceably with them so far as possibly may
compliancy with any man to the prejudice and of the truth
my very adversarious must needs confess have bn so from preaching contention strife and division amongst godly man of dissenting judgments in matters of worship that have to make up all and to all names and of distinction behind my back
now good friends and readers do not say have spoken any thing in passion or bitterness of spirit for if may uso pols asterveration cor
call god to record upon my soul have not
find my very bowels are moved for him and th would smite upon his thigh and say what have done am so far from hating his person or seeking revenge for any injury done to me that profess will lay my very hands under his fies to do him good
here is one thing that would have you and all men to take special notice of namely that mr communion dmetrically opposeth
the scriptures the plain letter cor
cor

his creed or at least this article of it viz
the communion of saints for suppose he believes in god and in jesus christ and in the holy ghost the holy catholick church but his communion must be of ungodly and norious sinners and not of saints

the covenant by which we are bound to endeavor a reformation according to the word of god and the best reformed churches who abbor such communions


the directory which saith the ignorant and the scandalous

are not fit to receive the sacrament of the lords supper pag
yea the it self which shuts the doors against and keeps out open and notorious evil livers till they have manifested repentance for the satisfaction of the congregation
it seems his reformation it to bring us into a far worse condition then ever we were in under prelacy and


and lastly
the principles hopes expectations and joy
endeavors of all godly ministers both of the independent so called and more purely presbyterial way who that it not wilfully blind will be of a communion that thus sets it self in opposition to all that is called god or holy in every dispentsation and form of worship
shall trouble you with no more at present but carnestly entreat you seriously to consider of these things and the lord give you understanding in every thing and lead you forth into the ways of righteousness that you may walk blameless before him in love

yours as ye are christs jos heming

judas excommunicated or a vindication of the communion of saints
to prove that judas received the sacrament mr deals with two suppers the one at in the house of simon the leper math

mark
the other at jerusalem the passeover night
the supper at bethany saith he was before the feast of the passeover luke
namely two days before mat
mark
answer

wonder a wise man should bring luke to prove the supper at bethany was before the passeover though confess it was so in which there is not the least mention of that supper
just as if should quote math
to prove that when christ was born his mother laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn

the following scriptures viz math

mark do not at all prove the supper at bethany to have been just two days before the passeover but that two days before the passeover the chief priests and scribes fought how they might take by craft and subtilty and at last concluded it must not be on the feast day viz the feast of the passeover lest there should be an uproat mark

the supper at bethany is as likely to have been six days before the passeover as two
then jesus six days before the passeover came to bethany
there they made him a supper joh
now here ariseth a great question between mr lightfoot and my self namely

which was the supper at bethany that mentioned joh


or that john

he saith that in joh
and upon that mistaken place hath built his wood hay and stubble
boys and girls if ye can but tead english come forth and shame this great master in israels read both the chapters and then tell him which speaks of the supper at bethany
but answer that in iohn
was the supper at bethany and not that in iohn
for
in iohn
bethany is not so much as once named but in in chap
it is as also in math

mark

in iohn
there is no mention made of the womans pouring oyl upon christ for which very act the supper is remarkable and ever shall be math

mark
not yet of indas his indignation not of christs reproving him all which we finde in iohn as also in the places before quoted

in iohn
now before the feast is not meant two days before as he would have it the words are undefined span alphabet meaning immediately before as luk
undefined span alphabet the pharisee wondered he washed not before dinner that is immediately before dinner

at that supper iohn
christs hour was come
ver so that he was betrayed the very fame night as tis evident comparing ioh with ioh

and math

mark
this discourse passed betwixt christ and pe the very night in which he was betrayed
now
and lastly though much more shall be added if there be occasion if any man of common capacity will but compare iohn
from vers to
with math
to verst
and mark
he shall finde they all three speak of the same supper at bethany
and for what iohn differs from the other two evangelists in naming martha and laartes and in saying she anointed his feet whereas the others say she poured it on his head that shall be easily reconciled whensover mr please yea and as great that say not greater differences clearly manifested between marthew and mark in their relations of other passages perhaps of the same supper but at present refer him to calvin diodat or almost any other expositor upon the place

conclude against all he hath said or can say yet against

whatsoever all the friends he shall make in this controversie can say for him


that there was no sop given in the supper at bethany let him finde it me in mat
mark
or iohn

that the discourse between christ and his disciples concerning the traitor passed that very night he eat the at ierusalem mat
mark
and not at bethany two days before
for had ind been discovered at bethany how could the disciples john as well as the rest begin to be sorrowful wondering to hear christ say one of you shall betray me joh
and enquire who it was saying is it is it two days after mat
mark
luke

that christ washed not his disciplea feet at bethany but at the supper at ferusalem the same night he was betrayed ioh

that the sop was given at an ordinary or common supper which christ had the same night before he eat the passeover as calvin beza parem fulk wright pelargus toff tolet maldonat and divers others do affir in their of scriptures and which the imitated cor and immediately after the sop satan enered into him
joh
and immediately after that he judas went forth joh
and that he came in again is no where to be found neither can it be proved therefore he eat not so much as of the passeover but only the common supper much less received the sacrament

the reason why mr lightfeor hath gone against so manifest light of truth the whole current or stream of orthodox godly and learned expositors common sence is to me as clear as the sun at noon days and tis thus he thought if ever he proved indas received the sacrament he must first prove the sop was given two days before at bethany which could he prove would help his cause little or nothing and because those scriptures that do indeed mention the supper viz matth

mark
john
would not serve such a malignant design he wickedly and tis to be feared wrests and wrings in john
a place so far from proof of his purpose that who so hath but half an eye may easily see it never toucheth it
the man hath not yet perfectly learned

the trade of wresting and abusing scriptures subtilly for the the advancement of his masters kingdom

thus the very foundation on which he builds being found nototiously false and rotten and utterly rased might very well break off here but shall bestow a little pains in viewing his reasons alledged for father confirmation of his proundless assertions

it is probable saith he nor can be conceived that indas should receive the sop and so the with it and go to the high peds and bargain with them receive a band of men joh
and betray his master and all upon one night for beside the unlikeliness of it the text is plain that from the te of the receiving the sop he sought portinity to betray him mat
or how he might conveniently mark
luke
and how improper it is to say a man seeks convenency or opportunity when he runs upon a thing and doth it on a sudden refer to any one of common capacity
answer

tis probable all this might be done in one night for indas was not so far from the high priest the band of men not so far to seek see diodat on iohn
the devil indas and the jews not so backward in driving on this damnable design as be would insinuate my self have known in this betraying age five times more than this amounts unto brought about in short a night
but by the way take notice that by satan in scripture is to be understood the devil by mr lightfoots own confession and not a disease as he idlely and falsely affirmed formerly in my hearing the bare naming of this is a sufficient refutation of it and as clear a demonstration of a physitians folly


he following the old trade most shamefully abuseth mat
mark
when he saith tis plain from those texts that from the tune of the receiving the sop judas sought opportunity to betray christ read the verses before and after and then tell me it you can see but the print or footsters of any such thing
is it not plain in those places that from that time christ reproved indas for his coverous indignation at the spending of the ointment he sought opportunity and from that reproof took occasion to betray him tis evident he sought how

he might conveniently betray christ before he received the sop
but


a man may properly be said to seek opportunity or conveniency to do that which he yet doth the same night
now let any one of common capacity even mr lightfoot himself judg in this case
ii
is is plain saith he that indas began his treason at bothany mat
mark
answer
be it so but did he receive the sop there nothing else passed at the supper at bothany concerning indas but christs rebuking him for his indignation at the spending of the alabaster box of precious ointment for which he took occasion to begin his treason
iii
the devil saith he entred into indas at bethany luk
and vers
then came the feast and all the evangelists set the treason conspiracy before the feast of the passeover
answer

luke
speaks nothing at all of the supper at bethony nor of any thing done there

though all the evangelists place the conspiracy before the passeover yet they place not the giving of the sop at bothany read mat
mark
iohn and see if you can finde any such thing there
the conspiracy is as clearly placed before the sop as before the passeover

the original which mr lightfoot bids me observe in iohn
undefined span alphabet](others undefined span alphabet however translated whether a great part of the supper being done or when they were at supper or supper being begun or supper being prepared and ready and set on table helps not his cause one jot
will give him treb leave so he offer no violence to the text to translate it for his best advantage when he writes next
iv
it is plain saith he be received the sop before the feast
john
answer


perhaps christ did not eat the paschal limb upon the same day the jews did according to the judgment of sealign causabon and others as have found them quored
moreover see diodat on mat
and then the feast the disciples dream'd of might very well be the jews passover kept a day after could

speak more for proof of this from iohn
ever mr lightfoot will be able to answer but at present refer him and the reader to the places themselves


observe how he would dawb over his own mistake with the untempered morter of the disciples ignorance what so of them thought proceeded from their ignorance john
if from this scripture he will conclude that there was another thing to the poor the diciples knew not as probably they might have conjectured from the discovery of judas two days before and his abrupt departure then immediately upon receipt of the sop that he was to be betrayed that night as it fell out and will manifestly appear to any indifferent man that will but gently read and seriously consider the whole story and then judg impartially for all the disciples ignorance and mr lightfoot grounded upon theirs christ had no more feasts

whereas he saith that we know the lords supper was given the passeover day at night viz the first sabbath of the feast whereon the jews eat the paschal lamb
am afraid he understandeth neither what he saith nor whereof he affirmeth be it so and then
how was christ upon the cross on the preparation day the day before the sabbath according to these scriptures mat
mark
luke
iohn and
verses
how could he arise the day after the sabbath namely the first day of the week mark
mat since he lay three days in the grave doth the man believe think you that christ eat the passeover a day or two after he was dead or that he did rise the next day after he had eaten it spectatum ad risum teneatis amici what day thinks he christ was betrayed and taken on or how long was it between his taking and crucifying wish the man be not found tardy here
thus mr lightfoots premises being weighed in the ballance of verity and found lighter then vanity what shall become of his conclusion but to trace my gentleman a little further

and it is plain saith he the premises considered at the supper at ierusalem he sate down with the twelve of which iudas was one mat
mark
luke
he taxeth judas for

treas mark
luke

answer
tis true he sate down at jerusalem with that twelve of whom judas was one in the common or ordinary supper and

tis as true that there as mr lightfoot doth most righteously affirm for the truth to the deeper wounding of his cuase lie ted judas for treason gave him the sop and discovered and not at bethany two days before
mr lightfoot
he delivered the to all mat

mark
luk
and they all drank of it mark
answer ii
the doth nor say he delivered it to th worse but to all namely to all present for indas had gotten the sp and was goes forth

it is had been said he gave it to the twelve yet that would prove nothing for in cor
tis said he was seen of cophus and them of the twelve though he was on only of theelaven mat
mark
mr lightfoot shall be so vain as to say behind my bick cording to his usund custom matthes was then in the room of indas and therefore there were twelve
answer that is notoriously salts for christs appting was before his and not after but matthias was till after his aseention acts verses to the end of the chapter how then could he be chosen when christ uppeared
whereas he affirmeth that christ gave the sacrament to judas fear he doth him more injury then ever he will be able to account for at his tribunal
did not he usually except judas have not chosen twelve and one of you it a devil joh ye are clean but not all joh
and again vers
speak not of you all know whom have chosen
but to those he gave the sacrament he saith without exception
this is my body which is given for you
this is the ly of the new testument in my blood which is send for you luk
surely christ could not safely say so to judas whom he to be a devil eternaly lost


will not drink hence forth of this fruit of the vine nul that day drink is new with you in my fathers kingdom mat
had christ means indas as well as the rest as be has

been present since he excepts him not he had been ly ken for he was never like to come there understand the fathers kingdom how you will


luk
ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations and appoint to you a kingdom as my father hath appointed to me that ye may eat and drink at table in my kingdom and sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
but
iudas had not continued with him in his temptation
neither
could christ appoint to him any other kingdom but that of wrath and darkness
nor
was he ever like to sit at christs table in his kingdom much less sit on a throne in the judgment of the twelve tribes who is himself to be judged as a devil

math

all ye shall be offended because of me this night
this is the same all to whom the sacrament was delivered
let mr lightfoot take heed how he traduce christ himself by affirming iudas was one of that all he administred the seal and spake these words to
and let him not think to evade any of these scriptures by saying iudas has received the sacrament and was gone forth unless he be able to prove it
mr lightfoot
cannot conceive how any shadow can be to gainsay his receiving
ans
he doth well to blame the dulness of his own conception
the cause he seeth not is that darkness which dwells in him
mr lightfoot
to vapor out another ans
the business he meaneth depends not upon judas his receiving or not receiving and that he and others may beleeve it doth not will here grant that judas did receive the sacrament now let mr lightfoot do his worst
mr lightfoot
will be as soon blown over as this
ans
beleeve him for this business is not yet blown over
he that doth it must have a stronger breath then mr por lightfoot
mr lightfoot
for the fancy is to make a noise of only the saints answer

hear heavens and give ear earth how reproachfully the man calls that a fancy all the scriptures bear witness to the

most precious truth
come let us reason together a little mr lightfoot do you beleeve there is a communion of saints if so how dare you call it a fancy if you know no such communion but oh that you knew it or rather were known of god in it may not justly number you amongst those iu

who speak evil of things they know not what is your communion of christ and belial light and darkness precious and vile saints and devils can two walk together except they be agreed amos
and do you think there will ever be any concord or agreement between these why would you have the dirt and filth of the nation bound up in the same bundle with the precious sons of sion why will you not allow iesus christ the most precious materials living stones to build him a house a temple withall come deal faithfully with your own soul and tell me whether the communion of saints be a fancy or not and give me leave to open my heart as freely to you and in so doing tell you that am afraid your fellowship is in and with darkness but assure your self the light will finde you out at length if not to your conversion but oh that it might be to that yet to your utter shame and confusion of face in the presence of those saints you dayly reproach and wound yea and christ through their sides
oh that could hear you say this expression dropt from your pen before you were aware of it and that in truth not in hypocrisie or that you would smite upon your thigh and say what have done

mr lightfoot
which if we could prove then we might gather particular churches
answer

so then by his own confession if we can but prove none but saints i.e such as have upon them visible or external sanctity should receive the sacrament we may lawfully gather together into a particular he means independent congregation
will the man stand to this think you fear not
if he will dare say that shall hereafter be proved an abundanti both from the scriptures the constitution and practice of the primitive churches the confessions of faith of the most churches in christendom and the universal consent of such godly divines both ancient and modern as he himself durst not but judg sound and orthodox
and the lawfulness of gathering particular congregations though am not gathering any shall defend against

all mr lightfoot hath to say on the contrary wish be may in the mean time forget what he hath spoken but if be he should shall relieve his memory

mr lightfoot
and so make a gain of that ans
who gains most man those that gather such churches or such as get sat parsonages of two or per annu and leave them when they can get better as having a clearer call or a better ayr take heed how you go about to stamp an odium upon the ways of god you may pay dearly for it one day
mr lightfoot
which by steps would set us in such an opposition to the ans
whom lightfoot never intends to oppose but countenance associate and have communion with as appears by what he hath written and dayly speaks on their behalf
mr lightfoot
as that we would leave them neither wealth life not liberty
look of the actions beginning and ending of muncer and his holy crew set down by sleidan

ans
this is but the mans old trade of calumniating lying and belying wish he would leave it but in the mean time dare pawn my life that generation of men he intends shall not touch so much as one hair of his head much less his wealth life or liberty
am afraid some of his unholy crew for why should separate him from those with whom he will have communion he must and shall go with them for fellowship with unholy ones he contends let him deny it if he can would touch theirs if ever it lay within their reach
but by the way take notice mr lightfoot is an independent and knows not of it be but now condemned of conscience in matters of worship and yet here he pleads for liberty even for the wicked liberty in the grossest fence liberty with the mischief but what a miserable condition are those poor men commonly known by the of independents in one while they are cryed out upon us the onely men that would have liberty a toleration of wickedness blasphemy sects schisms another while they are set in such an opposition to the wicked as that they would leave them neither wealth life nor liberty
am unwilling to put a strange interpretation upon mr lightfoot liberty would therefore have him to unriddle himself and then happily he and may agree
in the mean time

propound this quer to his consideration viz
whether there be not a world as may say in england as well as a church and whether such viz
independents anabaptists seekers
presbyterians for by such names he knows may godly men may not be tolerated in that world to enjoy their consciences in relation to the ordinances of christ security being given in point of civil subjection who may not be tolerated in the church and whether we have not better grounds in the word of god to walk in with godly men and women though of different judgments than with those wicked ones he so hotly contends for


to that of muncer and his holy crew answer as may not take upon me to justifie the actions beginnings and endings of all men of this or that form of worship so it becomes not mr lightfoot did he rightly understand himself to judg of this or that form or way by the carriage of or gods dealing with the corrupter sort that profess it for at that rate of judging what would become of christian religion set on foot by christ and the twelve amongst whom there was one devil for communion with which he pleads
must the gospel it self be condemned because many men of corrupt minds have dishonored it or the old legal administration because of the rebellion of korah dathan and abiram or will mr lightfoot undertake for all of his own way be it episcopacy or presbytery if so presume shall find him work enough
this may satisfie any sober spirited man yet add moreover that have as little ground to beleeve sleidan in all he reports of those men he himself being an adversary to them and their way as have to beleeve mr edwards wrote in his book of lyes commonly called gangrana against such as were not of the same judgment with himself or what the papists write of us who live not in their abominations
but
whilst he is condemning one wicked and unholy crew he is pleading for communion with another let special notice be taken of this
it seems that way wherein to the great grief of the saints there have been are and will be found many ungodly ones must be utterly condemned whilst that wherein all the unclean beasts in a nation live is vindicated
but for and his holy crew is mr lightfoot calls them they might very well have been of his own church

mr but more of this shortly
answer
as much as you will and as shortly as you ever it come to my hands you shall not stoy long for an answer though need say no more but that as fast any of churches of iesus christ purge our the old leaven out off and east out corrupt members as adulterers fornicators drunkards covetous you may take them into your fruternity there's none will be offended with you think for my part will not
now before mr lightfoot and part let me tell him
that he shall never whilst he live be able to prove indas ceived the sacrament scarcely the passeover and yet can and do grant him both without the least prejudice to that righteous cause maintain shall be more full manifelled hereafter if the lord give me time and strength

that should wrong him if should not rank him amongst the vilest in the kingdom for with them no will have communion us a member of the same external visible body by vertue of which relation they are all his brethren and sisters so that he hath his brother druard brother thief brother murderer brother lyar sister whore sister witch yea all that have been hanged at tyburn and all in england ever since he was born and baptized into that fellowship he pleads for have been his brethren and sisters lot him or any man else upon good grounds deny it if he can
precious hearts ye that live godly in christ iesus being in him dead to sin and begotten unto good works if ye will be of this fraternity mr lightfoot and his unholy crew will be friends with you but the lord keep you from such an unsanctified fellowship and gather you up into that union and communion with himself and his christ that can make you one spiritual body even the body of christ rom cor
then shall ye be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord and he shall be glorified in you by you and amongst you

a
mr lightfoot gave out that he would print this answer of mine as though that had been an invincible reply confess if he had done to he might have put himself to some cost and might have sustained much wrong but now have grevented both and know no cause he hath to be offended with me

to the right honourable sir charels blunt knight lord mountioy and knight of the most noble order of the garter

my lorde epigrames are a scarse worke they haue euer had but fewe writers and yet too many if my booke please not yet this shalbe sure of rare discommendations the greatest

aduenture that knowe is to write mens iudgeme~ts are of so many fashions yet this is my comfort that my booke is of the fashion
if the common manners commend him he hath giuen them no cause
if anie obiect to my calling this kinde of writing in other things woulde be glad to approue my studie to your good lordshippe
these are the accomptes of my idlenes
yet herein may seeme to haue done somthing worthy the price

of labour that haue taught epigrams to speake chastlie besides haue acquainted them with more grauitie of sence and barring them of their olde libertie not onelie forbidden them to be personall but turned all their bitternesse rather into sharpenesse
but the worke it selfe in regard of which most humbly craue your honors patronage doth in the nature and kinde thereof deliuer me of an epistle and bidds it giue place to an epigrame

if my pen an higher taske should set

great lord what better matter could finde then of thy worth and vertue to entreate of thy heroicke spirite and noble minde now take my gnatt and try me in a toye whether hereafter may sing of troye

your honours most affectionate seruant

so poore of sense so bare of wit am

not neede her selfe can driue an epigram yet neede is mistresse of all exercise

landlordes and tenants raigning more and more
betweene the borrower and the viuter
betweene so fewe rich and so many poore ours were the golden age but these home iarres houses and fields and states haue ouerthrowne
and spoyled vs no lesse then foreyne wars
thanke we this idle mischefe of our owne
but who did heare or who did euer read peace without wars or something else in stead

epigr

in misum
first misus coueted a peece of goold then a small house and little garden plott
then copie land and after a freeholde
at last a shipp by coueting he got then out he streched reaching auarice to a shippe loade with goolde and by degrees

manours and castles tempt his hollow eyes

then to a mine of goold he swiftly flees
then greater lordships he doth seaze vpon
no goold can still his bottomles desire
nothing can scape his goold he presseth on and to all india lastly doth aspire
where now a little mine hath him inhold where is nor house· garden land ship nor goold

epigr

ad comitem essexa
how hath a little chance great fortune crest the spanish fleete euen balased with goolde a narrow misse did snatch out of our holde which we nere had but yet desire as lost
but if this losse must purchase thy returne
and buy thee out of danger emminent how rich are we by loosing and content

how woe are they that they are not vndoone

more thou art fearde then any losse of spayne deurox and england loues thee more then gaine·

epigr

rome hath a batrayne vine yet doth not spare with a strong hedge to compasse her about
we haue the true vine which we do not care to fence against the wilde boares rooting out
if my poore prayers may be heard in time would we had their hedge or they our vine

epigr

in caium
caius hath brought from forraine landes a sootie wench with many handes
which doe in goolden letters say she is his wife not stolne away

epigr

de naeuo in facie faustinae
faustina hath a spott vpon her face mixt with sweete beawty making for her grace
by what sweete influence it was begott know not but it is a spotlesse spott

epigr

de eadem

so in fayre faces moulds somtimes arise which serue to stay the surfeyte of our eyes

epigr

if a poore minister haue done amisse then his high calling is obiected to him· high to all wrong grant our calling is and great and wonderous to our vndoing but they which set vs high to all disgrace in honour put vs to the lowest place

epigr

ad thomam strangwaies
strangwaeies leaue london her sweet contents or bring them downe to me to make me glad
and giue one month to country meriments
giue me a fewe daies for the yeeres had
the poets songs and sports we will reade ouer which in their goolden quire they haue resounded and spill our readings one vpon another

and read our spillings sweetly so confounded

nulam shall lend vs night in midst of day when to the euen valley we repaire
when we delight our selues with talke or play sweete with the infant grasse and virgine ayre
these in the heate but in the euen later weele walke the meads and read trowts in the water

epigr

in mathonem
matho with angry countenance threatned me
for that toucht him in a verse of mine
said knewe it not not so quoth he that can shew and pointed to the rime
so he accusde himselfe for had not he he might haue kept concealements close for me

epigr

stand want and waite doe what you can

stand poore want foole waire seruingman

their doors are made to shut thee out or let thee in to goe without
their goolde their idoll they doe make
should they for thee their god forsake

epigr
de infante mortuo ante partum
the infant lying in the mothers wombe through vnknowne griefe vnsuspected death resing'd not fully yet receiued breath
and so lay buried in a liuing tombe
the wofull mothers heart this so did greeue
she wisht it had bin buried aliue

epigr

in causidicos
ovr vice our outrage and malitiousnesse set ouer vs newe maisters and new lawes
which preying on our wicked simplenesse
do grow so great by minishing the cause

epigr

he which an elder seeking to defame reueales his secret to his enemies
deserues the heauy curse of wicked cham which did contemne his fathers priuities
the sire was dronke and yet the plague did light vpon the sonne which scornd a sinfull sight

epigr

clerkes to their liuings wedded once did thriue from which some are diuourst and yet do wiue then moses lawe tooke holde the brother dead the brother should suruiuing raise him seed
but we succeding husbands can haue none
which are so wicked husbands to our owne the wife tofore which many husbands had with their soft rayment and rich iewels clad

deckt with their comely loue and costly care

tyr'de like a princesse and without compaire
vve haue cast of from her owne blood kinne
to serue a stranger and to stoope to him and she alreadie groanes as thrall indeed and we yet liuing stinke of this foule deede
vvhat should the enemie do with barbrous knife learne of the husband to torment the wife wolues to your selues vipers to your own mother
and caterpillers eatinge one an other

epigr
how deerly doth the simple husband buy his wiues defect of will when she doth dye better in death by will to lett her giue then let her haue her will while she doth liue

epigr

de poeta martiali
martiall in rome full thirtie yeares had spent then went he home was not that banishment

epigr

in laetum· letus in vertuous manners may excell but what neede hath he so rath to be good his strength of body which he knowes to well his life forbids him and his youthly blood
thus vice and pleasure haue our strength prime and vertue hath the leauings of them both
she hath the orts and parings of our time
then when euen sinne our carion course doth loath we may be good but must be aged surst
thus we are good neuer or at our worst

epigr

epitaph iohannis sande
who would liue in others breath fame deceiues the dead mans trust
since our names are chang'de in death
sand was and now am dust

epigr

de puero balbutiente
me thinkes tis pretie sport to heare a childe rocking a worde in mouth yet vndefild
the tender racket rudely playes the sound which weakely banded cannot backe rebound and the soft ayre the softer roofe doth kisse with a sweete dying and a pretie misse
which heares no answere yet from the white ranke of teeth not risen from their corall banke
the alphabet is searcht for letters soft to trye a worde before it can be wrought

and when it slideth forth is goes as nice

as when a man doth walke vpon the yce

epigr

svch was my griefe vpon my fatall fall that all the world me thought was darke withall and yet was deceiued as knowe
for when proou'de found it nothing so shewde the sunn my lamentable sore
the sunne did see and shined as before
then to the moone did reueale my plight
she did deminish nothing of her light
then to the stars went and lett them see no not a starre would shine the lesse for me
go wretched man thou seest thou art forlorne
thou seest the heaue~s laugh while thou dost mourn

epigr

ye cookes and pothecaries be my friend

epigr

epigr

ad lectorem
if my bookes easie of digestion be thanke not my matter reader but thanke me how many verses haue cancelled

howe many lompes of meaning seasoned

suffer epigrams to sprowte forth when vse mine arte and prune them with my pen
for he that will write epigrams indeed must vse to wring the meaning till it bleede

epigr

in sabellum
biting sabellus hereat takes offence because lay not open all my sense
all must be plaine and nothing must hide there must be notes at ende and notes by side
there must be nothing fett and nothing strayned the reader must delighted be not payned but am of an other minde for why should not he take some paines a well as

epigr

ovr vice is runne beyond all olde mens sawes

and farre authenticall aboue our law
and scorning vertues safe and goolden meane
sits vncontrolde vpon the high extreame circes thynne monsters painted out the hue of fayned filthinesse but ours is trewe
our vice puts downe all prouerbes and all theames our vice excels all fables and all dreames

epigr

whe books poore men they their parish burned these their low houses raz'd ouerturned are driuen to seeke changing their olde repayre they in the ground these dwelling in the ayre
when sport is made of damned fornication
and vsurie an honest occupation
when dull cramde grosse and swollen gluttony scornes wholsome temperance with leaden eye
when pride like polling miller sits vpon

the bated gryst of poore religion

when holy tithes the highest callings price make iags for coates and fuell for the dice may we not well times on manners cry this were an ease it were no remedie

epigr

in brillum
brillus tolde such a tale as neuer man did heare or thinke of since the world began
tw'as not of murther strange nor filthinesse nor open wrong nor secret wickednesse nor legend tale nor ancient poets fable nor such as parasites do tell at table
it was nor monstrous lie nor pleasant fiction· nor of affirming nor of contradiction
all writers trauellers merchants are to seeke yea iohn deuiser neuer tolde the like
it was a tale of oaths abhominable
god was the iest and our dread christ the fable

epigr

laetus did in his mistresse quarrell die quintus was slayne defending of the lie
germanus in his friendes defence did fall
sakellus died striuing for the wall
merus did spend his life vpon a iest
sanmus lost it at a dronken feast
merus at sundaies wake reueng'de the wrong of his bull dogge vntill he lay along
what sayst thou now contemn'de religion vice hath her saynts and martyrs thou hast none

epigr

in porum
bitus desired porus of his grace that in his seruice he might haue a place
he sayde he was of of honest occupation

he could no lye nor false dissimulation

he knewe no wicked meanes to fill his purse but porus answred he likes him the worse

to the reader
to premise nothing at all to such a bulk as seems to promise by its great quantity to have something of weight worth or good quality in it were to erect a spatious city with no gate into it an extream on the other hand as absurd as that of his who building the little city mindus is said to have made it's gates bigger then the city
to praefix a prolix epistle to a large book may prove as cumbersome to a conscientious as tis ridiculous to a rationall reader to make many long proaemiums to a short one
as therefore shall forbear lashing out into any long or loud proclamations of what profit may accrue to an unprejudic'd peruser of the following fabrick vino vendibili non opus est haederâ so shall yet not for custom but convenience not altogether omit in way of initiation or introduction to premise first some words more generally to all sorts of readers
dly more particularly some to all plain country people
dly
or
words to all priests and scholastick rabbies
thly some few to the powers of these poor brittish nations

then as for the book it self in the
parts thereof which this relates to know all people that herein ye have the tall academicall sons of anak to whom the seed of jacob seem but as grashoppers uncapable to grapple with their greatnesse taken down or that great goliah's head cut off with his own sword by the power of god in the heart and hand of a despised country

stripling who coming from following the ewes great with young and perceiving him in pride to disdain and defy gods armies in the name of the living god went forth to meet him in answer to his arrogant challenge with a stone sling in his hand brought down the uncircumcised philistine to the ground

for herein by way of plain reply to sundry books of those four men aforesaid viz
two english treatises which treat pretendedly for but in very deed against the scriptures as to that very authority and integrity of their hebrew and greek texts he pretends to plead for together with his third tractacle of latine theses pro scripturis contra fanaticos in which not without a legend of as loud lyes of the quakers as lewd laughings at the lords spirit and light within in opposition unto both he as vainly adventures to evince it that the scripture alias the outward letter is the light the only most firm foundation and perfect rule of all saving belief and holy life that it is in esse both reali and cognoscibili yea properly as to name and thing no lesse than the very living word of the living god
ii
t.d's
two trifting tractacles term'd
the quakers folly manifested
the quakers wisdom not from above occasioned originally by
or
publick disputes at sandwich held with him and his adherents by three of them viz iii
nine sermons
into one treatise untruly term'd true old light exalted and not only back't but thrust out also by baxter in his blind zeal against that same unblinded people

to which said reply is annexed an appendicular postscript abridging into a closer compasse many of those absurdities confusions riddles and rounds the rabbies run into unawares in their unwary wrestlings against the quakers
and a positive true testimony according to the externall letter to the internal and eternal light both in latine wherein it was first written and also in english whereunto it is for further service translated

herein say is the of the divines and meer humanity of the doctrines of the academicall doctors discovered also the with the innocency of their cause cleared against the insolency of the choicest champions that contemn them and the divinity of their doctrines vindicated from their clamours in the points hereunder specified viz liberty of conscience having the faith of god without respect to the persons of men iustification by the righteousness of christ alone the scripture and what it is as to name and thing the word of god and what as to name and thing the light of christ in the conscience as to its universality and sufficiency and bow it and not the external text or letter is the only firm foundation of the churches faith the only true of all doctrines the only right rule of all saving beliefe and holy life the infallible spirits infallible guidance of all that follow him as their guide at this very day the generall grace and love of god in christ to the whole world every individual in it and how it is great universall true and unfained notwithstanding through each own fault very few in it are saved election and reprobation how it is of two seeds only absolutely and of persons only conditionally as born of and growing up respectively into the image of those severall seeds perfection as to freedom from sinning in this life and such other for which we are as unjustly as uncessantly assaulted

about which points it's hard to say whether the quakers opponents do more oppose them or abuse them by misreporting them as holding far otherwise then they do in those and other of their tenets to the world

for when we declare against persecution and cruell forcing of all men to uniformity in meer outward formes of religion by which men for fear conforming to do and to say they believe what they believe not to be truth are more made hatefull hypocrites then faithfull christians and for liberty of conscience as that without which now no government in either church or state can ever stand long unshaken those powers being ever more feared if not abhorred then either lov'd obey'd or honour'd by the tenderest of their own people who touch and under

penalties impose upon them in that part i.e the conscience which is tender and in which being trod upon all people when they can help themselves will turn again but those ones whose way it is when they are kill'd to make no resistance jam
then they tell people we are against all good government and authority settled ministry and good
orders in the church and such like
whereas and all good government in states to suppresse unrighteousness we own and good orders in the church too denying that only which they call order who meerly under that name and notion of decency and order have fill'd the nations call'd christian with a numberless multitude of ceremonies and customes which are vain and create nothing but confusion also they tell people we do but barely insinuate that of to be our principle that we may be let alone till we grow numerous and get outward power into our own hands that then we may rise and cut throats and by force and cruelty subject all people to our wayes

deducing it as is seen in the book ensuing thus from a certain quakers drawing of his sword who had no sword at all about him the truth is quoth he the qua now declare their intentions to propagate their perswasions by the sword

whereas we live in that light which leads to that love which abhores all cruelty and tis the dark places of the earth in which themselves dwell that are full of the habitations of cruelty and could we once be by others as candidly consirved and credited as tis by us conscientiously and clearely declared so far are we from that pernitious principle of persecuting for conscience sake though blinded any men called christians in any nations that were it as in our hands to effect as it is in our very hearts to wish the contrary nor jew nor turk nor pagan much lesse christian so cd whether papist presbyterian independent baptist or any other behaving themselves as peaceably subjectively as we do to all civil laws in civil things should ever be in the least more then by words of love whether smooth or sharp to win them to the truth th their souls may be saved in any meerly spirituall or religious matter but in all ecclesiasticalls so

far as consistent with and not destructive to any other mens have in their consciences where christ alone is king truly and fully as much liberty as our selves even all people to walk every one in the name of his god as we in the name and light of the lord our god from henceforth even for ever

and because we say some truths and teach some doctrines which to their misunderstanding minds only wherein they wrest everything the wrong and even the worst way they can and as they sound it out in words of their own which are none of ours seem only to savour of popery viz
because we assert the good works of christ in his saints to be necessary to their justification who cannot be justified by any of their own they not only charge us as joyning with jesuits and papists but also as far as they dare in such a thing as they have no proof of they down rightly pronounce us to be such
whereas how neere of kin they are in their own and how none are more contrary then our tenets to the pope and how well proves the author of this epistle in probability to be a jesuit as he falsly affirms is to be seen in sundry pages together of the following work viz from
of the exer to the end

and because we make mention of christ in us and the righteousness of the law as necessary in order to salvation to be perform'd and fulfill'd in our own persons as paul does rom
though we mean no other righteousness then the same that is in christ and is wrought in us by no other power then that of christ and that same christ too of whom the scripture speaks that to him give all the prophets witness act

that in his name and through faith in his name alone who ere believeth shall receive remission of sins then which christ and his name there is no other under heaven given among men whereby they must besaved they us both to god men as denyers of christ and of his righteousness of justification by christ alone witness one ackworth of rochester who was once heard by the writer hereof deprecating declaring against the qua in these words to god himself in his publike prayer viz
above all things lord quoth he deliver this poor city from the qua they are a peole lord that deny god deny deny the righteousness of christ deny justification by christ

alone
whereas as it was at that time by this author prefered though not permitted to be presently and publikely proved to his face on behalf of that people whom he told lyes on to the lord himself that they own god own christ own christs righteousness and own justification by christ alone so against all the priests who in their several parishes misrepresent us as going about to establish our own righteousness only not christs to our justification among whom t.d is in that point the most gross false accuser of us as it was clearly enough to men not minded to be blind by word of mouth at the disputes at sandwich and hath been since by george whiteheads printed replyes to t.d printed misrelations of us in that matter so is it abundantly proved more at larg in the first exercitation from to the end thereof that ther's no people do more fully or so truly disclaim their own as dung and filthy rags and stablish christs righteousnesse alone which as wrought by christ in his saints makes no better then dung loss and filthy rags to both the justification sanctification and salvation of sinful men from all their sins then the quakers do who are by the parish peoples blind leaders most abominably to them as denyers of it

and because we do not with the misty ministers undefined span alphabet of the meer letter which the apostles were not ministers of but of the mystery of the new testament or the spirit cor
own the bare external text of scripture which themselves confesse to be corrupted vitiated altered and adulterated in all translations to be at in their heb and greek transcripts of it entire in every tittle letter vowel syllable and jota the self same without any losse as it was at the first giving out but say it hath suffer'd much losse of more then vowells single letters and single lines also yea even of whole epistles and prophecies of inspired men the copies of which are not by the clergy canoniz'd nor by the bound up in the bulk and compasse of their modern bibles and specially because we own not the said alterable and much altered outward text and letter or scripture but the holy truth and inward

light and spirit which the scripture it self testifyes to which at times that text and letter came from to be as to name and thing and that properly the word of god which is living the only firm infallible foundation of all saving faith and invariable right rule of holy life the most sure sound balis stable standard true touchstone for the due tryal determination and discerning of all true doctrines of christ from mens tradition and cunningly devised fables therefore they cry out against us as siders with jews papists athiests and all scripture haters as decrying the due authority of the as such by whom satan assaults the sacred truth of the word of god in its authority purity integrity and perfection and as opposers of the scripture and the word of god as to both name and thing witnesse j.o's
dedicatory of his doings the quakers to all young divinity students
and elsewhere as is seen hereafter
whereas how though christ and his living word in the heart which the exalts also is exalted onely on the throne yet the scriptures are owned by us in their due place and how though christs light and spirit alone in the conscience is according to the scripture asserted to be the only most perfect rule foundation and not the as they darkly divine yet the letter is acknowledged by us full as much as it is by it self to have been written by men moved of gods spirit and to be useful profitable servicable to be read and heeded and how all
lying calumnies against the quakers as concerning their carriage to the scriptures and the word of god and the foundation and rule are clearly wiped away and cashiered as well as t.d's foul false aspersions of them in his narratives as to matters of fact are in the
part of my
exer from to
is to be read at large throwout the and exercitations which consist well nigh wholly in vindication of the truth against their cloudy conceits about the scriptures

and moreover because we as the spirit also in the scripture bids us jam
have not the faith of god with respect of persons as they are high in this world

in the church where christ is the one master and all the rest are brethren therefore they misrender us as proud obstinate uncivil churlish discourteous disrespecting contemning all mens persons
whereas we truly honour all men in the lord and what we do in denying those vain complemental customs of the nations as vailing the bonnet or putting off the hat which is part of the outward habit and bowing cringing to the ground when we come before men and in our keeping to that plain yet not true antient and proper english language of thee and thou which is used to god himself to each single person great or small when we haue to do with them who have no law of man neither whereupon to imprison and punish any for doing herein as we do we do it god is witness and will once iudg between us and them not in a spirit of pride arrogance disrespect disdain or contempt towards any man but in conscience to the lord that we may stand clear before him who forbids us to bow to the likenee of any thing in heaven earth or under the earth and in humility onely and that fear of the lord whereby we are bound to depart from all conformity to all such fond foolish fashioning of our selves according to our former lusts in our ignorance and to this world which we are chosen out of a more clear discovery of the unsuitablenesse of which ceremonious services of men to the saints of god is made as in the scripture it self so in the of the ensuing exercitations from page to page


and because christs headship kingship and supremacy alone we together with the true church which is in god the father and in christ iesus the light can own in the court of conscience and in matters purely spiritual and of meer religious and soul concernment and not any meer mans much lesse the popes or any priests in such sacred secrets therefore are we mistaken and misranked among such as are utter enemies to the present kings supremacy in these dominions
whereas we do according to what the spirit requires of us in all civil causes and cases between man and man submit our selves to every ordinance of man himself say in such cases even for the lords sake whether unto the king

as supream or to such as are sent of him to be a terrour to evil doers and a praise to them that do well

and if those who have the sword in hand shall turn it against us for well doing and so act against the good will of god or impose by gods permission upon us contrary to our conscience even there where we cannot obey actively we are willing to bear patiently without violent resistance what god will leave us to suffer from the hands of such as should protect us not reviling nor threatning nor cursing but committing our case in quietness to him that judgeth righteously and our souls to him in well doing and that passive deportment must be and is judged by all to be aequivolent to that active obedience which others yeild for fear to what lawes soever are made among men

and because we are no strikers or fighters as some men called christs minister's alias servants are though no such should be tim

tit
with carnal weapons the weapons of our being not carnall but spirituall nor such as theirs among whom are found warrs and fightings which come from the lusts that war in their members iam
and cannot with good conscience to god as to military matters appear in arms any therefore are we prejudged as not submitting to nor owning magistracy as we say we do
whereas we do truly own and are subject thereunto witnesse the tenour of a paper given out from among us under many hands some while since in that particular a true copy whereof is here printed in the margent

and because we cannot swear at all but forbear it in obedience to christ's and his apostles words who intimating math

a permission under the law to swear so be men did not forswear but perform to the lord their then lawful oaths for to swear by any but god or to swear by god in ordinary communications was as unlawful then as now

sayes unto us swear not at all i.e in such cases wherein men might swear in old time who then might not in common communication and above all things swear not no not by any oath but let your communication i.e the whole of it before rulers as well as others be yea yea nay nay least ye fall into condemnation for whatsoever is more than that commeth of evil mat
iam
therefore are we in some places by scores at once put in prison as persons suspitious of treachery and unfaithfulness to the present powers
whereas howbeit we decline all oaths for the reasons aforesaid yet as it hath been own'd by the king himself as satisfactory to him as if we did swear if we can say we are or promise to be innocent as towards him so we both do and can declare our present and promise future integrity to him and the present government reserving our consciences to the lord alone in spiritualls in all cases of civil concernment and as our promise binds us more than their oaths do them as little conscience to keep the oaths they take as they do to take whatever is imposed and for fear swear themselves to and fro into the favour of every form

of government as it stands its time upon the stage so our practice will preach out our performance of what we and that performance prove our words once passed to be of as much worth and weight to us before the lord as their swearings by his name are who are found utterly out of his nature

and because we talk of an universal redemption by christ's coming intentionally to save all men though through their own default all are not but few only actually saved they pittyfuy propound us as denying gods eternall unchangeable decree and his praedestination election reprobation and such like
whereas how the universality of his grace appearing and bringing salvation truly and intentionally to all but that most put it from themselves as the iews did act

is no way inconsistent with but rather stablishing gods everlasting immutable councell concerning men as to salvation and condemnation it's most clearly demonstrated in the fourth exercitation from to

and because we call all men to look to the light within their own consciences and to take heed to that as ever they intend to enter into life assuring them that by the leadings of that light if they will they may come to god and work out their salvation and escape the condemnation that is to come they make people believe as if we held that all men in the fall had of themselves a free will and a power of their own without god to save themselves and without any speciall spirituall or supernaturall grace or gift of god even by their own naturall light which flowes from the principles of meer nature to help deliver and redeem themselves and as if we did destroy all that free grace great goodness and rich mercy of god of whose mercy and grace only it is and not of themselves that they can be saved
whereas we ascribe all the glory of our own and every mans salvation to god alone and his meer mercy and free grace which is and alone is sufficient thereunto and not to any man nor any thing at all in man that is of man and not rather the free gift of god to him saying that tis not in man without the gift and grace of god either to guide or to bring himselfe to salvation nor in him that wills nor in him

that runs but in god only that shewes the mercy and that light of his in every mans conscience even in the heathens which these men in the cloudiness of their own consciences which come not to the light that's in themselves call naturall we say is that speciall gift of gods own grace every degree of which is sufficient to help heal and save him that takes good heed to it and to lead him forth that follows it as it increases on him that does so to the light of life yea tis a measure of that spirit of his a manifestation of which is given to every man to profit withall of that spirit that strives with all men but that most resist it in their stiff necks and uncircumcised hearts that convinces the whole world of sin righteousness and judgment though all are not thereupon converted by it same measure at least one talent of which is given to the most unprofitable servant till not trading therewith it be taken from him tis somthing of that goodness of god which though men will not know it and few are led by or follow it while it drawes them yet does lead them and though they refuse to return and so fare the worse for it does its own part so far as to draw them to repentance yea tis though in men yet of god and no less then his own law in their own hearts of which law the letter sayes though men till spiritualized by it are carnall and sold under sin yet is spiritual holy just and good whereby every man is a law to himself before god who wit judge him and either accuse or excuse acquit absolve clear justify or condemn him in the day when he judges the secrets of men by christ out of the book of their own consciences once to be opened in which thereby both jus and factum right and fact is according to the gospel that's preached in it and by it in every creature under heaven as well as to somely mans ministry to all by some outward ministry or other also and is not any meer naturall faculty as our naturalists call it that is as naturall to men as his mind it self is as j.o mindlessely asserts it to be for then it must be de homini so essentiall to a man that he neither is nor can be truly call'd a man without it whereas though man in the fall is in indeed so short of the man made at first after gods image or of man restored back again thereunto that he is comparatively to such one

but as the of the field that perisheth yet in the fall he hath all that is essential to him as a man and flowing ex principirs naturae but and this may be an addition to the other arguments in the book if it be not touch't upon therein already gods law or light in the consciences of all men which we call them to though given of god in some not the same measure at first to all so that universally every individual or hath or hath had somthing of it yet through mans not using it well may he yet remaining essentially a man be totally taken from him as the talent from the and darkness come upon him and be left to walk in utter darkness and to stumble in that dismall night of which its said then and of that time he that walketh in it knows not whether he goes and to stumble not only because he hates the light as he did before while yet he had it but because now he hath it and because now there is no light left in him of which light and of its universality and sufficiency to save such as seek god in it and how it's a supernatural spirituall gift and grace of god to all men where it is and not the naturall faculty of mans understanding only as our opponents prae to prove it is is most proved in the from to
and made more apparent in the appendix also

and when we assert the ministry of christ to be an infallible ministry and the spirit of god by which his ministers are ever guided in the work of his ministry for they are out of his ministry or service and in the devils at that time who ever are at any time guided by any other is an infallible spirit for god hath no fallible spirit that we know of and that all the directions leadings and guidances of that spirit are infallible which spirit hath no fallible guidance as little lesse then seems to intimate he has that we know of and consequently that all who are led by that light or spirit are so far infallibly led and that all and only they are the sons of god that are led by that spirit of god and that god hath children at this day in the world and so consequently that at this day his ministers and children who are all of god are infallibly taught as they attend to that anointing that's given to be their teacher that leads into all truth which

spirit of christ also whoever hath not as his teacher is none of christ's then they bely us as saying of our selves that we as of our selves as undefined span alphabet as j.o flouts are infallible
whereas we say no such thing at all of our selves nor of any men but that all men as in themselves and in the fall are no more then fallible but because men in the fall are fallible liable of themselves to erre still as they are erred already to their own ruine therefore god in his love hath sent his son a light into the nations so to be his salvation to the ends of the earth to lighten them that sit in darkness and to guide their feet in the way of peace out of the crooked paths they are in in which who walks can never know peace and that the light and spirit of him who is the light of the world the lord that spirit which is truth it self and no lye is lent as the letter speaks of it to every man even that true light that enlightneth every man that comes into the world given to lead him back infallibly unto god from whom it comes who can be known out of that no more then the sun can be seen by any other light then what shines from it self in which light wherein he looks after the lost whoever look after him are not undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet and shall find that salvation of which he says look ye unto me and be ye saved all ye ends of the earth of the infallibility of which light and spirit and of its guidance of all christ's ministers and children and of all men also so far only and no further then as they are led by it as of old so at this day there is much said in answer to those ignes fatuos that fain the contrary in the exercitation from to

and because we call on men as the scripture does to perfect holiness in gods fear and to cleanse themselves from all uncleannesse of flesh and spirit then which there is no more as a thing attainable by christs grace and power only improved as a thing not only possible to be done here as god requires who calls not for impossibilities from his people on pain of eternall punishment if they perform it not but also needfull and necessary to be done here if they mean to do it at all sith as themselves say with vs against the pope theres no purgatory in the world to come they commonly accuse vs of saying in a proud disdainfull boasting

way over all other men of our selves that we are perfect and as impudently intimates that we impudently glory in it that we are free from not only hypocrisyes fraud wickedness lyes which it seems he can't glory yet that by the grace of god he is yet free from but even from all other even the very least evils and so would have us have punitiones incarrationes punishments prisons for so saying

whereas we use not to bear testimony to our selves but to the truth of carist and though by the grace of god only we are what we are
and his grace to whom alone therefore we give the glory and not to our selves who have nothing but what we have received and glory not as some do in sin and shame nor boast as they do in evill doing of anything thats good as if we had not received it is not in vain so but that our walking is such that they can't accuse some of us justly of the least evills yet we testify the truth rather as a doctrine to all teaching not what our selves are what ere we are so much as what both we and all men should be and also may be by the grace of god who is not wanting to us if we be not wanting to our selves and must be also viz deniers of all ungodliness and worldly lusts and godly righteous sober livers in this present world or else it had been better men had never been born seeing for them that loose their day for it here it's too late to begin that life in the world to come where there is no purgatory nor place for repentance though it shall be then sought carefully with teares pro

in this doctrine as in many more if they do not maliciously us yet at best they most miserably us not well heeding these things that hereunder follow


that the qua themselves hold not out as attainable such a perfection of holynesse grace or glory as to degree here as admits of no addition of a greater degree of it hereafter for of the increase of christs image glory and kingdom there is no end but such a perfection only as is without unholiness or committing any sin or transgression as whereby there is a perfect defacing and destroying in them the works the old contracted ugly

image of the devil anger hatred envy wrath blood cruelty uncleanness drunkenness and all such like lustings to evil which whoever are not purged from before can never enter into the kingdom of god and christ which is that incorruption that corruption cannot inherit full deliverance from the doing of which evills is a true perfection of holiness according to the measure of it though not so great a measure of it but that hereafter there may be more as adam in innocency had no sin yet not so much of god good and glory but that it might possibly be augmented the elect peter writes to received the end of their faith the salvation of the soul which is from sin or nothing by him who was manifested a light into the world to this end even here to destroy the works of the devil


that we hold not out a condition of full freedom from temptation which if any be without he is wise enough to keep it to himself and not to prattle of it to the priest who for all his preaching against it can't with patience hear of turning yet from all transgression and lest any should think of me as more then yet am am not yet that man who ere he is thats free from temptation
but in our several measures what we witness in our selves by the power of god and gospel of his light and grace viz a liberty not to sin which is that some long for but from sin and a freedom from following any lust and an ability such as we found not while we were where priests their people are to walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and to be saved from sinning though not from sins objecting it self to us and from transgression though not from temptation so it is a true state of perfection and a state of true perfection or else christ himself who was often tempted matth

yet never sinned was not perfect


that we hold not as there are some that sillily suppose of us saying the qua say they are so perfect they cannot sin an impossibility of those mens sinning who while they sin not are saints for the denominations of sinners and saints do tollere se invicem so as he who is a sinner while

such while sinning is no saint as dotes and he who is a saint or holy one clean from sinning is no sinner specially not as david was while in his guilt and filth of murder and adultery as dreams also for no sinner is a saint while sinning nor is any saint a sinner while a saint or holy one but a possibility only not to sin as men take heed to themselves by the word and light non posse peccare is one thing and posse non peccare is another and the divines can see it so sometimes when they please though they will not own their own distinctions when the qua make them they say men must needs sin while in this world measuring others by themselves who are yet sold under sin and so under a necessity of committing it and falling under the law of it and because we own them not in their extream which of the two is off from the truth they dream we are in the other so as to say men after they once one the light cannot sin thus the vile person churl whose instruments are evil destroyes the poor with lying words when the needy speaketh right things for we say that men though they ought not to sin yet may or may not sin according as they heed the light or heed not the light which is the power of god against it by which psal
a young man heeding it may cleanse his way not must necessarily whether he heed it or no let him that standeth take heed left he fall to say men must sin is one thing can't sin is another may or may not as the light is kept to is the truth


that we doctrinally hold not out such a full freedom and attainment of over sin per saltum at once or at the first step of a person from the darkness wherein he dwelt toward the light so that after once converted to the light only and to wait in it there's a full deliverance witnessed without any more ado as our national ministry who are oft more willing to mistake us then rightly to understand us make it out in their muddy medlings against the qua before their people but that those that turn to the light in their consciences which reproves and condemns even the most secret sins in the flesh and obey it and abide

by it waiting patiently on the lord in the way of his judgments while the spirit thereof and of burning passeth to the purging away the filth dross and tinn to those only as well as to all those at last judgement shall be brought forth into victory over the sin that's judged the righteousness of the law fulfilled by the power of christ in them bringing it near to such as thirst after it and revealing it in the light from faith to faith rom

we say not it's the work of meer man nor of a day but the work of christ which in due time he will without failing and being discouraged in it perform and bring to passe for the battle is not ours but the lords in such as stand still beholding and following him in the leadings of his light to the rooting out of all iniquity and establishing of equity in the earth to the accomplishing of the work of regeneration or begetting men back from the image and nature of the devil and life of sin through the death and blood of christs cross which being but begun in the first act of conversion to god which our to the deceiving themselves and people think is regeneration enough for them and to serve their turn though their turning to god as they call it be not yet from darknesse sin and the power of satan to god in his light neither but from some one empty dead literal form of profession or other to another they look for the fulness of· as to freedom from sin no sooner though for shame they say not so much in words because they would seem at least to be at odds with the pope about that point then in some certain purgatory in the world to come not mattering to be holy here as god is holy merciful as he is merciful to walk as christ walked to be as he is in this world in whom there is no sin to be pure as he is pure as men are required to be and till they are tis condemnation because of sin and as such as sing with him on mount sion rev
are and must be but contenting themselves to be as ever learning and teaching never

learned nor taught so ever purifying though never purifyed and if the work were as truly doing too as tis pretended to there were then according to john
some true hope because a hope that it would once be done therefore we own the weakling that is waiting on in his measure of the light of christ in his own conscience as one that is in a truly hopeful way in which keeping he will once come to something though a little child who if he do sin as he knows he should not knows he suffers for it yet is not without an advocate iohn
but alas what hope that the work of purging from sin shall ever be done where its never rightly doing as it is not among the priests and their people who are not only out of the light in which alone life comes but also out of the love of it and so at odds and falling out with it as to blaspheme it by the names of figment fancy fanaticism as j.o does and out of the faith of the thing also the work is not so far as in yet while men in their fiery spirits are fiercely fighting against the light which only can do it and believe not it is possibly to be done what hope then is there that ever it should come forth in facto esse

having given this generall account to all sorts of the work hereafter following and of what points are therein principally propounded to publick view and how we hold them a word or two more particularly to some sorts of readers

know then
all ye honest minded persons who possibly may conceive your selves not much concern'd in viewing over such a volumn as relates so directly and immediately as this mostly seems to do to the learned linguists and academical scholastick rabbies who get as much skill as their skulls can scrape together in scrawling and scribling against each other about their hebrew and greek texts and transcripts of the scripture the very literal sense of which ye who may know the truth nigher hand can ken no otherwise then by their confessedly untrue translations know say that howbeit this is intended mainly as an alarm to all sleepy shepheards

that lye down to sleep loving to slumber and so consists of various matter much of which may run beyond their reach who are neither by nature nor their nursing mothers meer natural nurture skil'd any further then their mother tongue nor yet by the spirit in the things of the spirit neither yet here is some matter and that not a little of such a nature as is no lesse plain to be understood then profitable not to say necessary to be learn't by the lost sheep that have long slept with their drowsy shepheards in the dream of their night visions in the dark and cloudy day of their dimm divinations have bin scattered from their own border and driven to and fro from mountain to hill from form to form profession to profession tradition to tradition and from one outward observation to another and caused to erre after them and wander together with them up and down in dry and parched places in the thick wood of their own thoughts in the wilderness of their own wretched wisdom where they have found no sound health nor reall rest or refreshment but rather more wounds and weariness to their restlesly wounded and wearied souls

be not therefore bolted out by the fight of sundry passages of it that are pend on to the pecular purpose of others from beholding that in it which if perused by you in as much purity as it was pen'd in pitty to you may be of pretious use to your selves for herein also is an hand lent in love to the lost to lead you in poor perishing parish people by the dore above which you and your clergy have been long climbing up as high as heaven with capernaum in your laodiceau literature but are so far from obtaining entrance into that pure pasture which christs sheep partake of who hear his voice that in stead thereof except ye yet repent from your powerless profession of what ye are out of the true way to the true possession of ye shall all as assuredly as shee was of old be brought down to hell

yea herein all along throughout the whole work lyes as

it were a little line before all save such as love to look beside it laid for any that will lay hold on it to lead them not from but to and by and together with the letter of the scripture to the light of him in the heart which the letter came from who is the only light that leads throughly to the life even his own life and to himself who is the truth way door light and life it self of the sheep and looks after them that have gone astray from him to gather them back to look after himself alone for salvation in his own and to learn of him alone who alone hath the words of the eternal life which all the foresaid and truthsellers while refusing to stand in his councel and to receive the word from his own mouth are so living so dying vniversally shut out from for ever

moreover if any either through of my honest meaning or male construction of my good intention therein shall be offended at my medling so much as have done specially toward the latter part of the second excercitation in matters that seem to any who are more seriously addicted then most schollars are whose life is wholly lost in looking after littles so immomentary to the life of god as the meer external text of that eternal truth that's therein talk't on and those hebrew points tittles vowels accents letters and syllables of it are which am in not a few pages together totally taken up in and for a time taken off by from points of more immediate pertinency and truer tendency to salvation their unjust offence at me shall not so far offend me but that for their sakes can and shall here stoop so low to take that stumbling block out of their way as to tell them and the whole world the naked truth how it was with me in that particular and the real reason why went so far in a talk comparatively to the truth of toyes and trifles and was so taedious to my self and such as look't long since for an end of this labour and wasted so much paper in a work so worthless as it may seem to some as is fitter for o's iuniors to be busyed in at their schooles where pueri tam puerilia tractant then for men cal'd ministers to medle too much with whose wisdom lies more if not in forgetting

yet at least in forgoing frivolosities that are so remote to the souls redemption then to fight so fiercely and foolishly for them as owen does whom neither for nor against but about them only have much to do with so that bear with me in it if it must be deem'd my folly the ground of which piece of folly is as followes

in his threefold thing found
in the theses of his latine thoughts glorying not a little in being on behalf of the collegians among whom he was then a chieftane as he talks with the task of contending for the text of scripture not so much against the foes as under that name against the truest friends of both the text and truth as the word of god properly as to name and thing and not only consequently but most expresly also both there and in the of his two english treatises the only most perfect rule of all belief and holy life stable standard true for triall of all truth doctrines spirits speeches yea its own also and the sole sure foundation for all true faith to stand on and be discerned by from falsehood fable and meer fancy and not only so but also tiring himself in his taedious second treatise to evince the entireness and integrity of the said text to every apex and tittle as at first it was given out without addition ablation or alteration in the least or syllable
in the of it in the original languages how ever confessed by him to be corrupted and egregiously adulterated in all translations and insisting so uncessantly eagerly and earnestly in proof of the said integrity of the outward text as for hast to outrun all his own reason and to reject also the uncontrolable reasons of all others to the contrary putting also so great a stresse upon that poor punctilio of the hebrew punctation as from a imagination and dangerlesse affrightment to stickle for its antiquity those that on better grounds iudg it to be novelty and not coaevous with the consonants with such as to deem all divine saving truth lyes at stake and is eternally liable and likely to be lost if it be not as he conceives

in these particulars for as is seen at larg in the book ensuing he trembles to think what will be the how desperate will be the of such a conclusion that the hebrew and greek transcripts are by mistake in a tittle and that the points vowells and accènts were added to the hebrew text by the tyberian mastorites

a firebrand is brought into the churches bread corn quoth he all's utterly undon for ever as to any true distinct sound certain saving knowledge of god or understanding of his mind will without either remedy or hope of recovery undefined span alphabet ther's no firm footing nor foundation to stand on no abiding bottom at all to build on no right rule for the faith and obedience of the church to be regulated by no word of god remaining uncorrupted no more means to be seen of being delivered from utter uncertainty in and about all sacred truth
nay though it be yeilded by his antagonists that howbeit the copies are corrupted altered and found various in their lections as to the meer letter nevertheless the saving doctrine as to the substance of it remains sound and entire in the copies of the original and the translations that remain yet this is no satisfaction to him he deems that the saving doctrine can't continue entire and uncorrupt and that their is no relief against the absolute perishing of all truth one of the world without any rule or measure of iudging and determining any more of it or principle of discovery or medium of its rectification or recovery if every tittle and iota be not preserved entire or on supposition of any corruption to have befallen the outward writing

yea upon such supposition that we have not every letter tittle point iota syllable accent as twas in the beginning of its writing without alteration by ablation of any apex or addition of the hebrew punctation gods promise isa
mat·
fails his care of his word and church fails he leaves it in uncertainties about the things that are the foundation of all that faith and obedience he requires at our hands so that we know not where

to lay sure foundation of believing yea tis impossible we should come to any certainty almost of any individual word or expression whether it be of god or no
yea
out of jo
isaac he that reads the scripture without points and so must they read it did read it before points were say as they did before ezraes dayes if the points were not from moses is like a man that rides a horse without a bridle and

on this hypothesis that the points are added know not saith how bellarmines inference can be avoided then which know nothing in all his opposition to the truth more pernitiously spoken that partly by their addition and partly by the negligence and ignorance of the transcribers the hebrew scriptures which are not uuniversally corrupted by the malitious work of the jewes are not yet so wholly pure and entire but that errours are crept into them yea they that are otherwise minded then those are who maintain the antiquity of the vowels and accents and with radulph cevallerius whose opinion he sayes is his own that the hebrew language was written with them from the beginning do not only make doubtfull the authority of the scriptures but even pluck it up by the roots for without the vowells and notes of distinction it hath nothing firm and certain
yea so dangerous in the of contending for various readings though not false nor pernitious that there's nothing remai~ning upon that account firm and unshaken
without the owning of these points to be of divine original we shall be left unto great uncertainty in all translations and expositions of the scripture
yea the distemper that there are befallen the text varieties from the first copies is dreadfull and such as may well prove mortall to the sacred truth of the scripture

these cuen multis aliis are the extremities asserts his position in insomuch that if is hold not in this light he confesses himself and all such as side him to be and at a losse as to all their faith and unquestionable knowledge of any saving truth to this day

for asmuch then as saw the srs so blind as not onely not to distinguish which yet sometimes does but that's to the further discovery of his own confusion and when at other times he does not between the word or truth it self which was in mens hearts before the text which truth is by the quakers not denyed to be properly gods word the foundation what ever else falsly affirms the text to be and the text it self which in time came from it and does but of the word and truth to be nigh in the heart but also extolling those externalls with such extream rigidity as aforesaid sith also the fight is about no lesse then the very fundamentalls of the very clergy and university mens faith it self which is the most immediate foundation of the faith of most other man who pin their faith on their sleeves and believe implicitly at a venture as their ghostly fathers and holy mothers believe and so miscarry and drop into the ditch with them if those their blind guides happen to be out was much prest in spirit in words at length and not in figures as to she both the faultiness of the one the falseness of the other that might mind them of the onely true foundation of all truth which in the
exereition is proved to be not the text or letter which yet is owned as useful in its place but that inward light word and spirit jeers at and does all the despight to that almost is possible to be done to it by any that do as be sayes falsly the quakers do ex delight in doing the devils work of defiance to the word of god so not to leave him wholly unanswered nor yet answered only by the halves though in answering him should make my self more like him therein then am in his flood of folly and absur'd assertion of the necessity of every tittle of the greek and hebrew text to the being and abiding among men of all sacred saving truth this is the respect in which though else my life and delight lyes not at all in penning and printing ought about such impertinencies as these had not only a liberty lent me but also a certain load laid on me from the lord which led me into so large an examination of

o's
lost labour about the letter and to become a fool among fools at this time so far as to busy my self with them in their bawbles if by any means might gain some of them to a sight of their vanity madness and folly and to a sober solid seeking after the more sure and serious things of the true wisdom it self viz
the fear of the lord which is to depart from all that his light in their own hearts makes to be evil and to dwell not so much in the seeing knowing and talking of trivial temporall tittles as in walking in the eternal truth which is the beginning of that which is folly to the fools that yet walk in darkness but doth in truth excel their university wisdom or science falsly so called as far as light excelleth darkness

and as to the bigness of the book which calls for so much the more cost from him that buyes it and so much the more pains from him that's willing to busie himself in it if that trouble any one it shall not trouble me who have now gone through the toyl of that attendance to it which were it not freely for truths sake alone should in no wise take again upon me though to gain much more then the whole impression of it amounts hitherto to the charge of such as have carried it throw the presse the truth is once intended no more then to have set out some single sheets to o's onely but it so falling out that before was well warm in that work after two or three publike disputes at sandwich held by three of us call'd quakers viz my self with tho danson and sundry of his associates there crept out two quarrels of t.d against quakerism as he calls it much what to the same truthlesse tune as o's was and by and by another peice patcht up the same purpose from those two brethren and baxter that were once beating each other for some years together about infant baptism but are now both as one man biting the quakers as with their teeth which are as spears and their tongue which is as a sharp sword and baiting at that truth that's testified by them and finding that these four however oft contradicting each other

were all carried about in the same cloudy circuit and of doctrine and did all center in the same sinck of absurdities in their own sayings and of abominable abuses of the quakers and among them all so fuly in one synod sounding out the whole sense and leven of the whole lump that fere dicendum est quod non dictum prius there can any thing henceforth be said against vs and truth which is not said before by them instead of setting my self to enter the lists with in a single conflict saw it more serviceable to single out these four as four of their champions from among their and under the form of a reply directed by name more particularly to these four to give this as a general account of our own principles and answer to the contrary principles of mens and this occasioned what was in my intent set at first and smaller systeme to swell out at last into so large a size
besides as tis the very life of collegians and to busie themselves most in their musing places where they may have most being apt to think lesser paers pedling and unfit for them to find ought in that may be answerable to the vast voluminousness of their invention
so j.o iudges the quakers to be as it were but in jest and to trifle with him when they take him in hand and talk of his long tales in two or three words and would not have his matters medled with unlesse more fully witnesse epist

where quoth he one of not understanding me nor the thing he writes about his mind for opposition was to be satisfied wish could prevail with those whose interest compells them to choose rather to be ignorant than to be by me to let my books a one
another in answer to a book of sheets of paper returns a reply quoth he to much of it as was written in a quarter of an hour
this is the manner of not a few in their writings am therefore minded quoth to abstain from such engagements
upon such considerations was enticed on the enter and trace further and farther after him so that this may satisfie such

as would haue had it shorter but to be short with such if the authors pains and pay in fenning and printing be not worth the readers patience in perusing and purchasing who will may let it wholly alone for me· he that not the length of it hath enough of the same to make it shorter to himself however and may look upon as little of it as he lists

thirdly now ye priests and universally erring university leaders of all other people in things of the soul and its salvation shall say the lesse to you here by how much the whole following fabrick relates to you more particularly then to any though it only a general respect to you all in regard of your brotherly relation to those more specially spoken to but a general respect in some sort also unto all men whether am in more opposition to your principles or pitty to your persons scarcely say since seek the destruction of nothing but what destroyes you whose souls am sure love as much as loath those laborinths of your learning falsly so called in which you loose you selves and perish marvel not that my self and other man of more mean as count then your selves meddle so much with the matters of your ministry who have so long excluded all mechanicks and plain country creatures from the close conclave of your clerical and collegian counsells but know assuredly that the day of god is dawned upon the earth wherein from his own light which ye labour against in the of your furious minds wearying your selves for very vanity to blow it out it shall be fill'd with the knowledge of his own image and glory as the waters cover the sea wherein as ye have fought his fear after your own precepts traditions whereby ye have turned his uth upside down so he is as he threatned in that kind isa
bringing the wisdom of you wise men and the understanding of you prudent ones to nought so that your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay

wherein as ye have divided jacob from his god and scattered gods israel from their dwelling which is the light it+self in the hearts of men in which god is and dwells with

those who there dwell with him which light christ and his ministers seek to draw all to and by it unto god and which it's the devils work from the beginning to seperate men from in your anger which is fierce and in your wrath which is cruel like that of levi after whom you are called so he will you in jacob and scatter you in israel wherein as ye are become bruitish pastor's and have not sought the lord so ye shall not prosper but all your flocks shall be scattered from you wherein the lord of hosts is coming down to fight for mount sion to fetch his flock between your and like as a lyon pering on his prey when a multitude of shepheards is called forth against him he will not be affraid of your voice nor abase himself in the of his holy ones wherein he appears against you for the noyses ye make against his holy truth but as ye have provoked him to wrath by your own inventions and false worships so he will provoke you to iealousy by a foolish nation and weary you by such as are no people in your eyes and by mean weak foolish nothings confound your mighty things that are so that it shall be of the learned linguists and greeks that after wisdom the scribe where's the disputer of this not god made foolish the wisdom of this world who by wisdom knew not god this by that foolishnesse of preaching whereby he saves th that how are the hidden things of esau searched no more in is up thy sion against thy sons grd and them against thee greece as the sword of a mighty man in his hand and the foundations of thy faith and shaking all thy supertitious the ground

and as to the that are hold hereafter with you scholasticks in pave about the body yet its principally about the bottom of all your babyloni
buildings in which if your basis were not so brittle as it is and must be being by your own confession but the outward te of that ward truth which you te while you talk of it toly out of

must needs be by so much an unstable standard by how much by your selves by the pens of your university doctors in their choicest divinity disputes undertakings and fencing for the of it it's yielded to be as alterable in the very greek and hebrew copies of it as the letters vowells accents and lotaes of it are lyable to be chang'd in sound or shape at the wills of criticks witnesse the acknowledgements of j.o that lately choice champion and latine labourer pro scripturis against the quakers whose scribling so much on behalf of the scriptures and the integrity of the outward text and the word of god against us who are truer friends to both then himself which was the first occasion of this rescription and is very largly replyed to in the and of these
ensuing exercitations

concerning whose work many of you rabbies whom he reasons for and represents shall here subject onely these three things which consideratis considerandis will shew that by your own concessions to vs about the outward transcripts or texts of the scripture if they they are to be onely rule and of all that ye call your religion ye grant your rule to be not infallibly right and your root which is but a mouldring and mouldred writing to be but rottenesse and so consesequently that at last your blossom must go up as the dust

let it be how as is aforesaid and hereafter at large pleads the absolute necessity of the integrity of the present text to be in the hebrew and greek transcriptions though translations which are the peoples scriptural rule himself proves to be most exceedingly corrupted entire to every tittle as at giving out without any losse so strictly that if it be not so but it appear to have been altered by ablation or addition of the points by the tiberians cessarum he utterly gives up for gone all cryes undefined span alphabet where shall we stand
and sees no way to be delivered from utter uncertainty in and about all sacred truth


let it be considered that ye who plead such a of

such integrity of your foundation of faith had need be sure of your hand yea infallibly certain in your selves and in your proof of it to others or else ye make your own graves with your own hands and pluck up your own religion by the very roots ye stand eminently concern'd upon the concession of your faiths foundation not to be firm in case one tittle of the text ye frame all upon be found wanting or points added since its giving out to make it not probably onely as incertum aut ignotum per incertius aut ignotius but unquestionably clear that the text hath every tittle and that no points are superadded since its first penning or else to begin again with the qakers at your a.b.c in the things of god and lay a better bottom for your building and surer ground for your faith then ere ye have done for as sayes in another case its but meet that men should be call'd to account upon their own principles and such as suppose salvation to sinke if every syllable be not seen and repose so eternal a trust upon a temporal external text as to assert all saving truth to fail for ever if its transcripts be not as entire now as they were some thousands of years ago and the everlasting gospel of god on so ticklish a point as mens mistaking or not mistaking in writing out the bare letter of it had need to be not so suppositive as is but positive in their proof and uncontrolably demonstrative of their principall proposition and not impositive of their own thoughts imaginations apprehensions uncertain conjectures and pretended probabilities onely sith the stresse of a case of such dangerous consequence stands upon it that all souls as sayes at least so depend on it as to have no means of their salvation if their proposition prove false and they happen to be out or miscarry in it or else in case ye can't so clear it then confesse as seemes to do sometimes but that he is loath to stand long to the honour of such a confession that ye well know not where ye are nor what to say about the various lections ye finde to be crept into your text nor what may be the cause of its being so and that ye have nothing to blame but your own ignorance

of the scriptures and other cases and of the true foundation which is the word it self and not the scripture or writing of it and that ye have never with your shallow comprehensions and understandings ye have hitherto lean't to reached yet the depth of truth and so think it meet since ye can make no demonstration of your position to lay it down altogether and of learned men become meer wormes not captivating others to your own thoughts but captivating your own thoughts to the truth and to the authority of god in his word nigh in the heart and not leaning alone to the lesbian rule of a naked letter without you see

for as error minimus in principio fit major in medio maximus in fine so there being but some errours in your bottom ye builders your building must needs stand awry and be most crooked at the top

yea this is a most vndeniable truth that the faith about that which is beleeved to be the foundation of all saving and divine faith in other things must be built upon an undoubtedly divine basis and stand in a ground that can't be shaken and on an infallibly sure and unquestionable foundation and not on such a flexible thing as mans conjectures thoughts apprehensions opinions
this way or that nor on meer humane fallible perswasions reports writings testimonies traditions of authors either on one side or other or else as sayes so say we shall quickly see and because of this see it we do already what wofull estate and condition the truth that the scripture talks of will be brought vnto and how brittle the belief is if the foundation that any fabrick stands on should be stone and the ground that foundation stands in should be but sand that building will not abide when the stormes and waves come if the foundation of your faith in other things be the integrity of the text to a tittle as at first given out for so it is with or else he gives all up for gone and your faith about that entireness to a tittle of the text be founded no where but in fancy conceits thoughts or in the opinions of your selves and other

men ye side with opposing as learned as your selves that side against you here affirm in sober sadness and in the fear of god not derisorily that all your faith is of no more force then a is of to fight withall as to the effecting of that full freedom from sin and salvation which comes by christ which is the end of his coming to all those that unfainedly believe in his name


let it be and wisely weighed how wonderfully farre short of scientificall syllogismes and clear demonstrations or of so much as true topical evidences either your arguments are in proof of that entirenesse and integrity of your text in every tittle if there be no better to be vrged by you as in truth there are not then what are vrged by in that case on behalf of the university and clergy
for after had stood out as long as he well could with sticks and straws against the novelty of the points and the variety of lections in the texts of your transcripts he plainly yields and confesses both as is shew'd hereafter

vrging his false conceits about gods promise and providence and loving and carefull aspect over the transcribers and such like fancies of his own yea all along his own and others thoughts against them and concluding thence thus shall we think this and that is it not very improbable shall we imagine so or so and then at last clearly confessing the same he before contended against
which grants though when they are gone from him he would gather in again fearing he hath lost a if he do not a little qualify them yet in what a poor way he puts on to reduce and recover what he had given by his yieldings and acknowledgments and how they are of as little force and to as little purpose as pharoahs endeavour was to bring israel back when he had once let them go from him a very fool may feel by the following examination of what he uttereth toward the regaining of his ground again
his maxime or main proposition he fights for all along from first to last being that the now copies of the originall text are entire to a tittle without any losse by the mistakes of the transcribers or change by addition of the points

his main medium of proof is the promise providence and care of god concerning the entire preservation of your originall texts to a tittle the foolishness falseness weakness and absurdity of which together with many other mediums used by him not one of which is to so much as a topicall argument have sufficiently hereunder discovered

one of his main subordinate mediums is not the infallible guidance direction or assistance of god for thats denyed by him to all the transcribers the first as well as the last
but only the religious care diligence and consideration of their work in hand and with whom they had to do in it and gods loving aspect over them in it and this is all he does or dares ascribe to the best of them from whence he inferres no more which yet is not half enough to his purpose then a probability that they might not be mistaken at all in a tittle or at least not so much as the transcribers of heathen authors concluding in such like terms as shall we think can we imagine surely its very improbable it seems to border on atheism to imagine they were mistaken so as that the same fate attended them and the text in their transcribing it as hath done other books and much more such like trifling stuff
after this his arguing to which probability that they were not so mistaken he should seem to have himself in going but so far he begins to fall again by degrees and confesse st
that though it were very improbable yet twas not impossible for them in any thing to mistake and then dly a little farther yet he falls a confessing and granting potentiâ ad actum that they did mistake and that failings have fell out and been found among them and that from thence various lections are risen sundry of which he also instances in

notwithstanding all which concessions and grants whereby he layes himself and his level with the ground he yet seeks to scramble it up again and to save himself from sinking quite down by catching hold on many weak twigs and to lick himself whole with a legion of little worths which

as is shew'd hereafter do not heal him of the wounds which himself gives to his own

thus while wisdom builds her own house the foolish woman pulls hers down with her own hands

moreover how ye ministers unminister your selves every way who can't but see ye deny the onely true foundation the letter layes which is the light and lay the letter in its stead yet what a slender kind of honour ye give to the letter too for all your so loud laudings of it in words is shew'd exer

ye deny any infallible guidance of your selves as well as others at this day by the infallible spirit which holy men of god ever spake by as they now do in dayes of old ye deny the only way of justification by christ and his righteousness revealed in your selves ye deny the light that leads to life as very darkness it self ye deny perfection here the very end of all ministry ye preach for hire and divine for money and have beguil'd people into a love to have it so what will become of you and what will ye do when the end of all this comes upon you ye are such turners to and fro with the times turning and tempering your tenets thereunto that there's no generation of men unless that of those who with their traditions and empty formalities make void the end and equity of the law as ye with yours make void the very power and perfection of the gospell can so generally or so truly say as ye may of your selves tempora mutantur nos mutamur in illis witness all vicissitudes of the times from henry the th to this day wherein exceptis excipiendis some few only in each turn to be excepted who rather then turn would burn bear the spoil of both persons and possessions the two nurseries of this nation and their respective nationall nephewes and children viz

and such a benefice as a bishoprick may not be so swallowed without straining as to stop the once open mouths of smectymnuus his own is shrewdly suspected by many whose eyes are strictly set to see what some will do who seem to sit next dore to it what edm calamy and such as with him seemed to be pillars like jachin and boaz before the now tottering temple of the late presbitery will do in such a time if ever temptation by such a tender shall happen to attend them will be not a little observed by their old brethren who were once not a little observant towards them a little time to such as doubt them may now discover it

ye clash against each other as eagerly as ye are able in your blind zeal about many meer accessaries yet close as cordially as men of one heart and one soul under pretence of love to it in enmity against christs true light in all men which is that main and one thing necessary witness both tomb's and baxer's epistles to that very book of theirs against the herein reckon'd with wherein all their former fightings

for and against infant baptism seem to be swallowed up in the gulf of their ghostly agreement against us and vnanimous gainsayings of that saving grace of god i.e
his light which tit

appeares inwardly to all men from appearing if it might be in its outward ministry unto any at all

the lord open your eyes that some of you at least may yet see in this day wherein ye are much benighted what makes for your peace before it be hid eternally from your eyes that hell which is enlarging her self to receive all your pomp and present glory may not open her mouth and gape so wide upon you ere ye are aware that ye sink all down as uncircumcised ones into the sides of that infernall lake and so the pit shut her mouth upon you all for ever


and finally ye the present rulers in this english nation and the rest hereto pertaining whether supream or but subordinate though neither do nor may put what herein is put forth under yours or any meer mens patronage whatever but under christs alone by whose power only in a weak earthen vessel this work was thus far performed to whom only as it came through me from him so dedicate it back in service to his own truth together with all the honour praise and glory thereof which is due alone to his own name yet both may and do hereby present it unto you also as of no small concernment to your selves and more peculiarly unto thee king sith as thy personal interest as to outwards is now under god and christ the highest so thy personal influence into all temporall and civill affairs wherein thou art concerned to see to the common wealth of all people in this thy native nation that own thy supremacy therein and in all but truly spirituals and meer conscience cases relating immediately to the soul between which and god in matters of faith worship and religion christ himself by his light and no man much less the pope is the only judg is seen at present to be the greatest upon peoples affections that thou with them maist have the more perfect understanding of the principles of those people against whom ye are oft much
tis a ticklish time with thee king and thy government in the nick of which thou maist saon do that which may be the making or the marring of both thy self and it for ever it lyes on me from the lord herein to clear my conscience towards thee and those under thee in bowells of compassion to your pretious and immortall

souls in his name whom serve in humility of mind to warn you to take good heed what ye do by tampering beyond the line the lord hath you in the matters of religion and so by leaning to some one form thereof that may seem the truest to some men whose minds meerly for their own ends are moulded into the image of it ye lead all the rest away captive after that and so not only the seed of god in all his saints but your selves also so far as to lay wast not only that religion which among all the rest ye ruinate is the truest but your own also which ye would set up to stand alone in the ruines of the rest which said true religion god hath decreed so to stand that all those that are peaceable toward it and let it alone shall stand the more prosperously by it and all that rise up against it in their vain hopes to ruine it shall assuredly fall before it for its sake caution is not condemnation what ever cause there is for it at this time yet my call is not in this place to complain of what abuses honest men passe under both in city and country as contrary to what hath been declared by the king as they are without his personal cognizance thereof my hearts desire and prayer to god yet for this though divided english israel is that its people may not perish but yet be saved for bear them record they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledg if it were they would all come down to that one light of god in every of their own hearts in which god is in which alone as the letter it came from speaks john
all true union and firm fellowship both between god and men and betwen men one with another stands yet this say as one that hath obtain'd the mercy from god in his light to see it to my present grief for them if they see not timely to it that there can be no long lasting peace in these latter dayes to this or any nation in the world of christendom nor beating back again of those swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks which from plowshares and pruning hooks have been of late beaten into swords and

spears till secular princes become so prudent as by blind guides in spiritualls to be no more beguiled into a building up of some babel or other with the blood of all other christians that cannot blesse it and so pollitick for themselves at least if not so pittiful to others and patiently pious toward the lord as according to gods will therein to let tares and wheat stand still together though not in the one floor the church yet at least in one field the world or civil states thereof untill the harvest and to let religion alone which is that alone that crushes them to pieces while they meddle much to make it and cumber themselves more with it then god requires to stand or fall as true or false by its own power and evidence which is that of the spirit without the interposition of any external arm of flesh out in persecution of any to establish it for not by might nor power but by my spirit saith the lord and leave all people who if his word alone may not winn them have leave so to do from god himself so they'l take from him what comes on't at last to walk every one in the name of his god and leave gods own people who have no leave from him to do otherwise to walk in the name of the lord their god from henceforth and for ever

if ye go about to make religion a engine whereby in pollicy to establish your selves and make it not rather your own main design to establish it and that ye can never do positively by making lawes for the bringing of all to such or such a particular form of it but permissively only by suffering all people to be of what faith toward god they find evidence for in the light of god within themselves while they live in peace and faithfulnesse in their civil dealings and demeanour one by another which is the pleasure of the lord concerning you in that particular your work of settlement shall never prosper long as theirs hath not done who have lately gone before you for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it

my bowells my bowells how have been pained at my heart to see each of those three several churches of

christians that sit still under the shadow of their selfish shepheards under the cloudy conceits of their several clergies so called viz
papal prelatick presbyterial each of which will be national or not at all wearying themselves and their poor christ'n creatures with no other then the greatnesse of their own way and each as it were no lesse then ruentem sua suis ut ipsa roma viribus ruit that they all and all others also walking in love and peace might stand so long as they are able by arguments without armes to uphold them or any armour to shield them but only the armour of light by the evidence of their own words without the edge of either the civil shepheards or the souldiers swords swaying to any side any more then to see that the civil peace be preserved by them all is my desire it would then in coolnesse soon be seen clearly whose god it is that is the lord and by each single searcher that the lord alone is god and such as are for him would also follow him and such as seeing no other god then baal are for him would also follow him and each man be well contented to live and dye in the service of and receive his reward from his own god and they whose dagon cannot stand but fall before the ark of the living god would be seen to be but of that wretched race and if yet any are so devoted to their own false god though they see he cannot stand in the presence of the true god that they'l set him up again rather then they'l own the true one let the philistines erect their dagons after they are down as oft as they will even till they fall again and break to pieces they shall have liberty withall my heart to set them up for themselves to worship but shall never set them up again any more for me who know that what ever is pure religion in the sight of that generation who are pure in their own eyes and yet are neither washed from their filthinesse nor have faith they shall be while they live in this world whether they own or own not a purgatory in that to come yet that pure religion that is undefiled before god is to visit the fatherless and

widow in their aflictions and to keep a mans self unspotted of the world those men who abide stedfast unmovable abounding in such works of god as the light leads to find their labour not in vain in the lord but whoever seem to be religious and are unbridled and not ruled and ordered by gods own spirit in their spirits speeches and conversations and much of that sort of religion there is among christians as was once among jewes and is in all men whom god made upright but that they seek out many inventions which the scripture calls vain oblation isa

these mens religion is all but vain as it's all but novel and narrow to the oldest which is most true and most catholike or universal

as true as is that there are many religions in the world so tis that each religion pleads it self to be the truest and from no lesse then it's own greater antiquity and universality then all the rest and as truly know both that church and it's religion to be both the eldest and the largest which is by blind men judged to be the least last and newest as willingly yeild the eldest and largest to be the truest and if that of the quakers so called which is counted to be the most small and upstart be not the most catholike and antient that is in the world however now disguised by the serpents subtilty under the newest of those nicknames which the world never wanted in any age wherewith to render the right religion odious here professe my readiness to renounce it but if it be and there needs not much to do to prove it so to be sith to tremble at gods word and walk in his light and in an innocent honest humble harmless holy life the very end of all outward observations in which gods kingdom nor stands nor comes but in power and a more hidden and inward righteousness peace and joy required once by god and now by men practiced pretendedly to the self same end and to do as we would have others to do to us which saith christ

is the law and the prophets the sum and substance of all their doctrine the hight of which is that love that loves enemies does good against evil and works no ill to the neighbour and so fulfills the royal law which is the whole of the quakers work as to god and of their message from him to the world is no other then the same that was universal as to time from the beginning even from abel enoch noah who walk't with god in this life by the light which only leads to it long before any at all of that letter which came from the light and leads to it ever was to walk by and not so particular as to place as any of those are which falsly call themselves catholike and yet are not only thousands of years younger then this but also contained as even all christendom it self is in some narrow corner of the world into the whole of which the light hath gone out and brought forth fruit to the begetting of that general or catholike assembly and church of the first born whose names are written in heaven to which as the hebrews then heb
so the quakers now are come then let all those religions who now renounce it as meerly new and nothing beware lest they reject gods councel which is his light in their own consciences against themselves to their own perdition

this is that true religion which where it is not all outward observation of what god himself requires is now as under the law it was but irreligion and iniquity in the account of god this is the good way jer
the antient paths which israel ever busied in many lesser matters of tith mint annis cummin neglecting the weighty the main would never be perswaded by her prophets to walk therein which way and who so walk in it are the true way and holy seed which as the substance of the oak or flourishing tree of religion when the leaf of all outward form shall fall off and perish shall stand and abide for ever

this way is he who is the way truth and life and this is the church and people of god who walk in him of both whom though they seem to the blind seers to come after all other wayes and people it may be said in reference

to them all as john said of the same this is he who cometh from above and is above all who cometh after me yet is prefered before me for he was before me whose seed or church which is one as he said before abraham was am may say of all outward priesthoods and their churches before any of these were am be ye therefore all ye powers of the earth tender of touching the tender lambs of him who is the antient of dayes by whom the judgement is now set and the books are opening know while satan that old serpent is alive his antient wonted work will not be dead of moving you by his ministers whom be transforms as the ministers of christ and righteousness to make havock of both that despised ministry and that little flook of christ that hear his voice but be ye advised if not by us yet at least by gamaliels good councell acts
in your councells who said to them then as to you whom wish not to afflict any for the quakers sakes but to take heed of afflicting them at the wills of others whom they torment and trouble with nothing but as they think at least with too much truth refrain from these men and let them alone for if this their councell and their work be of men it will come to nought but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest happily ye be found to fight against god and its hard for you to kick against the pricks no powers nor people did ever harden themselves against god and prosper subtile sanballats talebearing tobiah's and haughty hamans who never had that honour from the honest mordecaies or seed of the jewes they hungred after being themselves that seed of evil doers which are never to be renowned were ever insinuating to kings and rulers against the saints in all ages as a certain odde people dispersed about the provinces and kingdoms whose lawes are diverse from all people neither keep they the kings lawes but intend to rebel est

so that it cannot be for the kings profit to suffer them and so as those ministers who though they swear to the kings supremacy in all ecclesiastical as well as civil cases yet in effect take themselves to be supream

directivè in point of appointing what's the faith what is heresy who hereticks owning the magistrates as supream only correctivè in point of punishing hereticks when they have censured sentenced them as such do at this day

that if it please the king they may be destroyed yet say to thee king and to all thy councells and subordinate powers as ye tender your internal external and eternal welfare proceed not upon account of their proposition of it to you to persecution of that seed which it's so much for the kings profit to suffer to live quietly under him that ye cannot prosper to any purpose but must rather perish in all your other purposes for their sakes while your hands are stretched out against them and till ye come to let them stand peaceably by you at least while you have your own if yet ye will not stand as one with them in their right religion and if ye mean more lastingly to enjoy your own formes of it which are not everlasting as the other is be not found fighters against the power of godlinesse where it appears for that hastens the fall of the formes before it which else would be longer liv'd then so they will be but if you build anything at all that shall stand much longer then while ye are building it return to him who not long since smote you or else his hand will be stretched out against you still and begin upon the right basis the light and spirit which leads only into that life and divine nature the letter talks on what ever forms of government civil or ecclesiastical grow not up from the ground of that true righteousnes peace and joy in a holy spirit in which and not in words shewes forms nor observations christs kingdom stands which is now at hand must give way to it as that comes on no building of man being able to stand where the lord begins to shew his building esdr
and though the builders think they make as sure work as those isa
that say

in the pride and stoutness of their heart the bricks are fallen down but we will build with hewen stone the sicamores are cut down but we will change them into cedars yet they shall build but will throw down saith the lord yea every house that is not so built is not on the real rock but the slippery sands and when the rain descends the floods arise the storms and winds begin to blow and beat upon the house it will fall and great will be the fall thereof

according to the liberty by you yet lent us who are in their desires sold not only for bondmen and bondwomen for then we should the better bear it but even as very sheep for the slaughter it's no treason to you for us to reason with them and with you about them by reason of whom so many souls are made to perish and tis no lesse then to betray your own souls to slaughter and eternal slavery for you not to try their talk
first who tell it you for truth that there is now no guidance of christs own ministers by christs own infallible spirit they that teach that their own teaching is but falible may easily draw all their implicit followers together with themselves into the ditch
secondly talk for liberty of conscience while they are under the lash of others and for persecution as soon as they can climb to be lords over all
thirdly that affirm christ's righteousness wrought in his saints persons by his power and spirit serving to sanctifie them too to fit them for heaven to be of no other worth and worth no better name and worse they cannot give it then that of unclean dung losse and filthy rags which doctrine is necessarily deducible from d's
writing against the quakers who yet sayes david even while guilty of adultery and murder was not in a condemned but in a justified estate fourthly that where and while god tenders salvation openly and universally to all men he secretly intends it but particularly only to a few

fifthly that that light the quakers testify to which

in truth is no other then the true light which the life is which their own rule of scripture sayes john
enlightens every man that cometh into the world enlightens not every one but very few and is an horrible figment of the quakers an imaginary christ as to salvation in all divine matters darkness blindness it self and many more sayings of that sort under which they scorn it as does

and other divines viz and little lesse

sixthly
that the letter of the scripture is the only sure foundation and rule of all faith

that the said letter is variable and varied and yet

that a thing that is variable can be no rule neither which is one of the many rounds the rabbies run in
seventhly that preaching of perfect purging and full freedom from sin in this world is a doctrine of devills so and punishable with prisons and other paines so that there's no purgatory for purging away the remnants of it as the pope falsly sayes there is in the world to come neither which perfection of holiness so far as to deny of all unholiness and salvation of souls from sinning is the meer end of christs coming matth

the end of all ministry that's of his giving eph
the end of all the apostles writing willings of men to walk in the light cor

iohn
and of all true faith or beleiving pet


and as it's no treachery in us to you nor others nor yet in you and us and all men to our selves to try what's truth

before we trust take and talk for it much more obtrude it as that truth which must subpaena as so be believed by ali so it's no lesse then time for us to ask and put it to the question among you sith both cannot be so who are so contradictory and if they be right weel own our selves to be wrong when once they prove it whether those who in christs name minister the abovesaid messes for truth or the qua who in their ministry minister the very contrary and no less then the infallible truth it self be christs ministers so having in my time born my testimony as a friend to the truth against such as tread and trample it under feet and an answer from that of god in all consciences to which appeal to judg between the clergy and the quakers who are in truth sit down satisfied in my own conscience in the sight of god holding love to all mens persons and warr with nothing but mens wicked works not knowing whether this may be the last time of asking after which as to this way of appearing in print against the pervertures of the parish priesthood may for ought know for ever possibly hold my peace

a lamentation over with a word of warning to all kings princes parliaments powers and people to beware of such priests uphold the devils kingdome by pleading contrary to the scriptures of truth a continuance of iniquity for term of this life a necessity of mens transgressing of gods law while they in the world or have any abode in the body

trow you'l know you cannot live in sin when all dy shall who live and dy in wherefore before you live you ought eschew it then must trust even whilst you live or rue it
read this for tis a else in th light heart read for th head herein obtains no sight its wis is too dim this depth to enter lesse you guesse by th spirit which dives to th center
give ore no more your selves with vain hopes cherish for lie and die in sin who doth doth perish
but lay away all weights sins which set you abandon and shake off such priests as let you and shun that run you may with saints that race which brings with wings from sin to th holy place
to th place where grace is perfect holy sion the mount where count upon't there comes no lyon nor man that can work evil where the pure in heart leave part alone and their right's sure for while you stile those saints who plead for evil and them christ's members who still serve the devil nor leave but cleave to them the light ye flee and sure ye pure as christ is cannot be
for hire they tire you out with talk know their words are swords which will souls throw
their eyes toward lyes are set truth they spatter serving swerving still from god they scatter

blind judgement it seems to border on atheism to say the same fate as to mistakes hath attended the hebrew and greek text of scripture in it's transcribing as hath done other books yet it seems to me upon that but running review have yet taken thereof that the same fate in that kind hath attended this of mine which hath ever yet attended both the scripture and his i.t's
and all other books too of any bulk in their passage through the press
as for the faults that have befallen this as they are not very many considering the greatness of the impression and the smalness of the print so they are too many to passe altogether unmended unminded unmentioned also whereupon excepting such as being more gross are with a pen already rectified to the readers hand of such as are not mended shall mention some wishing him to mend the rest in his own mind yet some of these hereunder noted were espied and amended before they were wrought off wholly at the press

the preface
john owen who hast been stiled doctor in divinity and dean of coll
oxon and thomas danson stiled a minister of the gospel at sandwich in kent and late fellow of magdalen coll
oxon
have taken a view of three books of you two lately extant against the people commonly called quakers namely of thy threefold thing or piece of divinity doings about the letter and the light lyingly relating in other parts of it partly and in its latine part principally to the quakers
also of thy two little of much falshood generally superscribed with these two untrue titles viz

the qua folly made manifest to all men in auswer to hub
the qua wisdome descends not from above in answer to whit replying to the other

for the truths sake which now lies at stake openly between you two and them am minded as moved in way of reply to say something to both your books and to your selves and the world also about them
intend not a total translation of that forraign language wherein that foresaid latine part of thine in which thou fight st most fiercely with thy friends was written so much of that shall serve as will serve the turn of such truths as plead against thee in the service of nor a total transcription of either of your books they are not worth it not yet an answer to every falsity that is found therein hoc opus luc labor est they are more then my measure of arithmetick can easily reach to reckon up but a due expostulation with you both on the quakers and the truths behalf an animadversion of some at least of those many absolute absurdities follies confusions false doctrines flat contradictions to yourselves which are and anon therein uttered by you a subversion of your who set the chief things ye have to do withall as it were with the heels upwards a blowing away of those blasphemies lies calumnies opprobrious titles disdainful subsannations unjust accusations spiteful aspersions abominable abuses out by you against the people abovesaid whom all that curse shall once see and say are a seed whom god hath blessed and to be short an examination of many such matters in every part of both your books how

scamblingly soever they lye here some and there some in them as find bear any reference to the qua or to those doctrines viz of iustification by the righteousness of christ in us of the letters not being the only foundation and rule of faith and holy life of the infallible spirits inspiration and infallible direction of his ministry at this day of the vniversal love and grace of god to all men of the true saving light of christ enlightning every man in the world of the attainableness of perfect purity or freedome from sin in this life in each of which ye differ from them and which against you both and your adherents are held forth by them

sundry false and grosly absurd businesses against the light and its children may not improbably be briefly noted as they lye most notably obvious to every common capacity in the nine sermons of iohn tombs b.d which came piping hot from the press while this of mine to you two is coming to it put out by baxter which pair of blind brethren as much enmity threatning and thunder without lightning as hath been between them hitherto against each other are it seems like herod and pilate now made friends together against christs light so as to make one head though two horns wherewith to thrust it down if they could for which a rod a rod in the lords hand is already ready for the back of baxter who and his once heretical and heterodox but now reverend and orthodox brother tombs as two twins that tumbled both out of one belly even one and the same womb of that babylonish bawd are both to be tumbled into one and the same tomb or grave that as your two so their pair of pratings may go together into the earth whence they came as like to like earth to earth ashes to ashes for dust which is the serpents meat all your divinity doings are and unto dust must they all return
now as little method as thy book hath in it yet is it as capable to be divided into parts as it is in each part in one thing or another most palpably divided against it self
as to the subject matter thereof it is in general twofold viz
the outward letter and the inward light that external writing or legible form of words commonly called the scripture the holy scriptures which are ad extra but ab intra only and meerly without though from within together with that internal law spirit power or word which is ad intra by all that know the truth as it is in iesus both seen felt heard understood and witnessed to be within not more cryed up by the men call'd quakers who live both according to it and the scripture then decryed by the men that are but supposed to be christs ministers who are utterly erring besides them both knowing truly neither the one nor yet the other

touches there are given by thee as thou goest along at other things viz vniversal grace perfection persecution modern inspiration by the spirit of god revelation and such like about which thine and the quakers doctrine differs by which as ex pede herculem thy pulse is felt and it's spied out how thy spirit blows against christs thy truthless talk of which may the lord leading to it not unlikely be talked with

by the way before have done but those two abovesaid being well nigh the totum in toto the totum in qualibet parte the matters thou mainly medlest with and most miserably mudlest thy self about thoroughout the whole body of thy book and every part thereof making little less then a very god of the one
of the letter which is the last and the least and the lowest of the two and little better then a very devil of the other the light which is the first and the highest and the greatest so that all others are but toucht upon as in subserviency either to the deifying or defying respectively of one of these to clear away that fog and smoak which thou raisest about them both to the thickning and darkning of the sun and ayr so that none can see either of them clearly through thy cloudy collation thereupon is the chief intent and likely to be the chief and utmost extent of this present answer

as to the tongue wherein it treats excepting here and there a little hebrew and for shew sometimes more then service a penful or two of greek interlin'd in both parts and now and then two or three licks of latine among the english thy book stands divided into two parts viz latine and english a cloven tongue of another nature then those that sate upon the apostles and these are as the two horns of that second beast that is as the lamb and yet speaks like the dragon wherewith thou pushest at thy opposers on the right hand as well as on the left even not only at thy own brethren the protestant divines when they please thee not by divining the contrary to thy peremptory peculiar positions and preheminent pratings together with that blind brood of the first beast of rome to whom both thou and all thy brethren though in many things ye justly band against them are brothers in nature still and of neerer kin then ye well ken or wot of but also against the true people of god
these two general parts each of which is prefaced with an epistle also in language like it self stand divided and subdivided more particularly within themselves viz the english into two treatises which subdivide themselves the one into six chapters the other though falsly figured into eight the latine into four apologetical exercitations as thou call'st them for the holy scriptures against as thou call'st the quakers the fanatical ones of these times
which divisions and subdivisions that are scarcely more divided from then against each other do all split themselves yet into a new needless number of smaller sections and
the two english treatises which arise mostly from one and the same spring or head together with the other not god nor his spirit nor yet the scriptures but the head of the serpent which is to be bruised thy own brain vain invention and imagination run along treating to and fro in two distinct streams or torrents awhile and at last having as thou sayst arctissimum materiae doctrine consortium a neer coincidence of their matter with it and affinity in their subject by which the whole trinity of them is drawn into that unity to compleat thy double doctrine far from the scriptures for the scriptures fall into one with the latine sourse or lake of lyes that burns more hotly then the rest in wrath against the quakers

and having there lodg'd and center'd thy two english discourses and drawn them into one with this verifying herein that old true saying vis unita fortior thou ventest that venome in stronger streams and spittest out that spite more fluently and in fuller floods against the qua which was in some few places only sprinkled out upon them before and filling up what was behind of thy flattering false applauses of the naked letter which with some of the same that were used before and some new undue titles here also magnifiest beyond the bounds and measure of all modesty and truth hoping belike to appear approved of christ as one of note in his service what disservice soever thou do him otherwise so long as thou art found saying something though hoc aliquid nihil est as good thou hadst said just nothing as no more to the purpose and raking and skimming and scraping out of thy own thoughts some ample apologies for the scriptures thou fillest up thy measure of mad mirth against that true inward light of god and its children that testifie unto it as that which is to be preferred before the letter and was before it as that which the letter was given forth from despising these as in thy english epistle

under the as false as foul terms of poor deluded fanatical qua pretending to be guided by an infallible spirit that oppose the whole truth about the word of god so there under the abusive clamours against and charges of them even by as fanatical ones that are notoriously known by their errours and foolishness who are driven by the power of an evil spirit depressing the light which is the name of christ exalted above all names without any colour of light or tolerable evidence of scripture or reason that it is by ten thousand degrees so bad a business as thou makest of it into so low a condition as wherein to stand in need so far as a thing that needs no such thing but infallibly evidenceth its own innocency and excellency may be said to need it of such apology as at the end of this work thou wilt find me making for it and so as to put it under every name that is named not only of things in heaven or pertaining any way to the kingdome thereof but of things in earth too and if ens be better then non ens as ye count it and a being though a bad one be better then none at all under things that are under the earth also setting it at naught so as to render it worse then naught till what in thee is thou quite annihilatest and mak'st just or nothing of it at all having made unto thy self a graven image and golden god of that meer image thou hast by thee of the old original copies of the scriptures in thy frothy vain light and yet dark and lightless mind thou dost hos omnes naso suspendere adunco ironically fall a scoffing at the qua and the true light of the true god and consequently at the true god from whom it comes puffing at it as if thou wouldst puff it out at a blast making thy self merry over it among thy academical admirers laughing both it and all that own it and so him that gives it out even to very scorn terming it as if thou knewst not what to call it that is bad enough for it know not what light that hath no community or correspondency with the scriptures and jeeringly the that counterfeited light or word within the feigned imaginary christ know

not what god or horn of the heavenly goat better then any god figment a certain imaginary christ they lyingly devise which is a light within common to all know not what spiritual every thing that is truly nothing the meer imaginary and fancied christ of a of fanatical men know not what divine quality or soul of the world mingled into all things which may be every thing and in very need is just nothing

thus when thou hast made thy self sport enough with vilifying the light of christ and christ who is the light thou art pleased to end thy play with a nullifying of it and so de nihilo nihilum nihil in nil out of this nothing there can come nothing and thou having done thy do with it hopest to hear no more of it away it must without more ado having nothing to do in rerum natura but to make merry a while and at his will to become nothing again
but

ego opertum hoc ridere meum(tam nil)nulla tibi vendo scriptura vel inane tua quacun{que vel ipsa

as very nothing as this light of christ and word within is with thee and thine whose thin somethings and empty every things in which you yet bless your selves are wearing out and mouldring to nothing yet such as know the true worth thereof will not so undervalue it as to sell it for any of thy vain scripture for the scripture nor for the best of that best scripture which thy vain scripture for it prefers before it which scripture yet as to its own proper place and use they are far before thy self in preferring
and howbeit thou deemest that the light thou so damn'st down to nothing hath done with thee thou having thus done with it and done it away as far from thee as a man of thy cloth can likely fling it yet there is an hour thou art not ware of wherein thy self and it must meet again in which it will find thee out for all thy floutings of it and come nigh to thee to judgement as a swift witness against thee for more things then that which thou hast forgotten and set all that thou hast done in thy vile body in remembrance and in order before thee and unless thou repent thee in the time wherein in the goodness of god its given men to lead them to repentance damn thee for ever far further from any sight as to enjoyment of it self and god then ever thou by all thy judgement past against it canst condemn it from thy self or possibly judge it out of thy sight

as for thy pair of pamphlets t.d they consist more particularly as follows viz
the first which besides its piece of preface is a meer fivefold fiction of a treble tale untrue relation or cursory crooked crude and decrepid account of the three disputations that were held at sandwich on the twelf thirteenth nineteenth daies of the second moneth
between thy self and three of us called quakers viz hubberthorn whitehead and my self together with a short answer as to the saving me that labour who should else have so entitled it thy self most truly superscribedst it
for indeed thy devils bow shoots too

short either to hit the mark thou shootest at or hurt that innocent lamblike spirit that speaks in that or any other of his writings to a trifling pamphlet put forth by as thou triflingly termst it and lastly a brief narrative so thou nam'st that last and most remarkable part thereof of some remarkable passages

the second which besides thy epistle and preface is but as it were a lesser chump of the same old wooden block with the other subdividing and cleaving it self out also into five smaller chips fit for little else but fewel for the same fire by which as by the day that now declares the workman and his work of what sort it is they are all to be both revealed consumed and burnt up among the rest of those bryars and thorns that are setting themselves to battel against the lord and of those buildings of wood hay and stubble which the scornets of the cornerstone are erecting to their own ruine viz a kind of epitomical repetition of what was shufflingly said by thy self in thy first tritie concerning the four heads or rather and indeed against these four points of doctrine viz the light of christ
perfection
iustification
the scriptures with frequent references to thy so call'd qua folly for the rest of thy replyes to us who had replied to them all ore and ore again before
and lastly another narrative not so call'd by thee yet for the lies and naughtiness thereof and nothing else much more remarkable then the former as will be seen in my animadversion of it
having said this little to you both i.o and about your books by way of preface or dedication of what hereafter follows to your selves and all your followers and in the like lame cause who belabouring your selves in talk about the letter against the light live and walk more by the false fire and twinkling flash of your own thoughts and infatuated imaginations then either by the letter or the light
come now undefined span alphabet without much preamble or more ado ad rem substratam to the businesse and work it self as it lies before me
and howbeit shall not regard any external form order or methodical manner of proceeding with you so much as words and matter of profit and truth it self yet as there is a quaternity of you or rather a fraternity of four angry fighters or quarrellers with the quakers and the truths told by them viz baxter all whom first or last one where or other more or lesse shall have to do with so though not therefore shall divide my ensuing undertakings against you in the name and power of god on their behalf in such wise as thou dost thy doctorlike divinity disputations or against them viz into four apologetical exercitations or earnest expostulations with you

the first whereof is to be more directed to thee t.d the rest who are of the same misty mind with thee not excluded in way of examination of that legend of lyes which thou like some great benefactor to it bestowest on the clergies cause against the truth and its children and as concerning the point of iustification in special which thou makest thy self a main mannager of against us for all the rest who say little of it and in which thou by thy lies about it in both doctrine

and matter of fact most basely abusest both thy self and the truth and my self in particular and all the qua in general also

the second is to be most peculiarly directed to thee in examination of sundry of thy base belyings and misreportings of the qua as to their toward the scripture about which who sides with three therein doth but give us a short snap and away and as concerning the very formal being nature text or letter or the scripture it self ye call your canon the or measure of that your supposed canon the hebrew integrity of the text to a tittle without various and such like passages which thou more preheminently pratest on then all thy fellows
the third is to relate though partly to and partly to and as being all three in some sort tampering together with thee in the same muddy manner about at least some of the same mistaken matters yet principally to thee who in the dark dream of thy night vision drivest on more down rightly as the prime promoter of these principles viz that the scripture and every sylle and iota thereof is the word of the great god the most efficacious powerful living word of the living god that it even that outward writing letter external text and not any such thing as an internal word of god spirit or light within is the only infallible guide incorruptible canon perfect rule of all faith holy life saving spiritual knowledge or worship the most certain sanctuary for the preservation of all sacred truth the most sure stable standard firm foundation true witness of god the most invariable inviolable way of safety and security to all divine verity the most absolutely necessary means of spiritual and eternal life cum multis aliis quae nunc praescribere longum est with much more id genus of the same soure leven too long to be reckon'd up here sith they are all to be elsewhere reckon'd with in due time and place

the fourth will be promiscuously and interchangeably carried on by way of entercourse with you both and which two only were intended to be by me so much as medled with when first was throughly resolv'd on some reply to your rude reproachings of the truth as concerning your denial of the universality and sufficiency to save such as heed it of the light and grace of god in all mens hearts of modern immediate divine inspiration of perfection as to the purging away of sin in this life and as concerning your dream of a peremptory election and reprobation of persons unborn viz of very few to life and of many to one as unchangeably to damnation without respect to their doing good or evil in their life about all which as occasion is must have in a few words a round reckoning with you both and all the rest of that brotherhood as blindly banding in one body in the mist of darkness not excluded for the rounds ye run in as to those particulars at the latter end in the said fourth and last part of these foresaid presents in which as occasion is ye four aforesaid for your own follies against gods wisdome are likely little or more to be all bespoken in one or other of

the chapters into which also shall subdivide the fore named four divisions

if ye four foxes that spoil the vine and her tender grapes whereof one successively still started out afresh upon me as was pursuing the sent and chasing the other had like those of sampsons turned tail to tail in all points as in some ye do and took several wayes ye could not so well have been caught altogether as now ye may notwithstanding all your majestical craft but sith ye face all one way and joyntly steer your course in general to one cave running parallel into the same wood of your own wisdome there housing your selves in the same hole dreaming altogether of no danger neer you in one den of darkness there needs no more but to set something to the mouth of that bottomless pit ye all belong to out of which the strong sent and stinking savour of your erroneous tenets vents it self to the poysoning of poor peoples souls throughout the whole countryes where your respective beings are and so digging you out of your foresaid dens put you altogether into a bag

s.f

the first apologetical and expostulatory exercitation
chap


first then though they came out last and began to fly abroad some while after owens yet shall begin with thy two butterflyes t.d which have flown up and down the world not only upon the wind of their own wings but also as fast and far as they could carry them upon the light chaffy leaves of the whiffling for some few moneths together to the frightning of all such folk as are befool'd into an implicit faith of thy folly to be wisdome out of that little wisdome they have by that fearful flutter they have made thorowout as well the cities as vniversities and countryes with that flashy and title of the quakers folly under a meer empty seeming shew of manifesting whereof to all men thou hast more truly in the eyes of wise men and more fully manifested thy own and that so egregiously that petulanti splene cachinno some man of a light spirit and ticklish spleen so much concern'd in the all manner of ridiculosities thereof as and my two friends of truth rich
hubberthorn and geo
whitehead who together with me who am very much are not a little belyed therein would have sent them home to their author long since with no other rod at their backs then some loud laughter thereat before the world they being worthy of little better reply howbeit have answered them hitherto with no other then sober silence partly because the first is captivated already from doing so much mischief as it was designed to and both before and behind too well besieged to do any great execution against the truth being a priori beset by a book of hubberthorns which it gives as it faith it self
a short answer to a posteriori by a book of whiteheads in which it is as soberly and replayed to and partly if not principally because as i.os three treatises have one with another as he saith arctissimum materiae seu doctrinae consortium so thy two books have with his as to the doctrinal parts such an affinity in subject and of matter being both putatory more or less against the truths the qua tell that in answering the one the other remains not unanswered and as to the narrative parts of both which are full of false narrations if two false tongues of two lying

linguists be like one another haud linguae dissidium scarce more difference in language then thus that as i.os book tells tales in some so both thine do in some other particulars against the qua insomuch that saw might as also accordingly do though the bulk hereof thereby become bigger and the time of its coming out to publike view a little later then was once intended in replying to i.o in many places wherein he and thou danson who eodem horrendo scotomate dance the often together in the dark do meet in one easily interpose such a general answer and render such a round reply to thee and thine together with him and his as by which the truth singly seek to vindicate may be truly served though what do is scarce so smarting a rod as by thy two abusive businesses is truly deserved and that what is fit to be said by way of answer to thee that is so that it can conveniently come in neither directe nor collateraliter as miscellaneous among the matter that mainly relates to i.o might as it is here and as it is but meet be clapped on as additional at the beginning

shall begin with the wings of thy two pamphlets each of which hath two waxen ones a piece viz an epistle and a narrative which by the help of those lyes and false tales they are as with so many peacocks tails behung with they fly so high at the face of the sun itself even the light and truth of the living god that they melt of themselves before the heat thereof and must at last lye as low though they sore aloft for a while as the very pit of perdition the smoak of which together with their locusts they first came out from
these their two respective wings whereof know not which to call the left and which the right so sinister are they all and so little dexterity is therein any of them being a little cropt or closely clipt the barebodies of both t.ds
divinity books as they will never soundly recover of those wounds that each of them hath had already from the hands of of g.w and l.h respectively replying to them so of the further bruises which they together with i.os academical ousets and hasty assaults of the same generation of just ones are like to meet with in this ensuing encounter they will be disinabled from flying abroad so fast as to do any mischief where the night spends and the day dawns though they may possibly live so as to crawl and creep about a while in some collegian cells and other such like dark corners of the earth
my entrance shall be at thy epistles in the first of which thou t.d sayest perhaps the reader will wonder that thou shouldst meddle with such a generation as the quakers and think thy time hangs on the lug and will not off at any considerable rate
rep am one of those readers that more then think thou mightst have spent thy time far more considerably and to better purpose to have fully fell on with the qua in that good work then to fall upon them for it so fouly as thou dost of calling thy rude people to repentance from all sin into perfect purity and holiness the very thing thou pretendest to have thy wages for

but when consider the old proverb that all trades must live and

that thine as well as that of the lawyers is no longer liv'd then while people live and die in trespasses and sins wonder no more then at demetrius and his fellow of like occupation who by that cast of keeping men in sinful blindness having their wealth throw dust into the ayr against the light that would lead them out that thou and thy muddy generation meddle so much as ye do to muddle mens minds against such an enlightening and purifying a generation as the qua are and besides prov
every fool will be medling as iannes and iambres were as thou and i.o

are to manifest the qua notorious folly in these daies till they most notoriously manifest their own

thou tellest twas never thy ambiti~on to appear so publikely as in print
rep
it had not need unless thou hadst better ware then thou hast the darkness which vents it in thee is the likeliest place to put it off in it being not vendible in the light
that hadst thou consider'd the likelihood of the qua printing which would necessitate thine thou shouldst likely have waved any discourse with them

rep insipient is est dicere non its as much innocencies ambition to appear openly in the service of truth as tis the guise of guilt to hide its head thou mayst well think the qua who are in the truth it self which thou art not yet so much as truly in the words of will not be by the wind of one that as thou sayst thou didst chuses rather to them and whether thou appear any more publikely for thy lyes and doctrines of vanities yea or nay yet the truth which may be a while opprest never sapprest

will now lye no more hidden under the black dawb of darkning but will appear and shine forth more and more as the morning light to the perfect day so that ye may to as much purpose forbid the sun from rising in its time as busie your selves as ye do to blind men as ye have done

that repentance is now too late and perhaps unmeet for god can serve himself by the meanest instruments among which thou rankest thy self

rep
not too late yet much less unmeet so be thou come back by a true repentance as is most meet thou shouldst not only for but from thy inconsiderate opposition for the lord will receive thee through judgement done upon thy lyes to mercy for all that's past in and by the same light thou art yet an hater of if yet thou wilt unfeignedly look back to it and follow on to know him in it while he strives with thee by it in thy own conscience and convinces thee of all thy evil deeds thou hast done and that he requires thee to depart from who can and doth serve himself by meaner instruments then thou mayst be made as meanly as thou truly enough confessest thou hast serv'd him hitherto

in case thou quit thy old master the devil whose now falling kingdome thou art helping hard to uphold while thou pleadst so strictly as thou dost to little purpose the necessity of all mens sinning while they live and serve the lord as strictly and sincerely against sin and satan in thy self first and then in others otherwise repentance it self may prove too late indeed and will too if thou turn not at the reproof of wisdome that as far as thou art from it is nigh thee in thy heart till it scorneth the scorners of it in love therefore to thy soul the sin whereof hate as it is the enemy of it as late as it is be in time qui non ante cavet post dolebit better late then never

thou sayest thou hopest thy reader will see the qua out of their disguise
rep hope so too out of that wherewith t.d and i.o have both disguis'd and disfigur'd them by then he hath read what r.h.g.w
l.h have written to thee before and what hereafter follows or he is one of those readers of us i.o complains of
of his epistle whose interest compels him to chuse rather to be ignorant of truth and us then to be taught truth by us and if any will either let our books alone or rejectingly read them and will needs be ignorant let him be ignorant as we cannot make such a one better so what ere he does we are never the worse
that he will find cause to speak of the qua with pitty and compassion
rep so hope too when he shall see how miserably the men call'd ministers do misrepresent them and by their lyes abuse and wrong them to the world

and of their opinions with hatred and detestation
rep with hatred and detestation of those opinionists who being but in their meer thoughts of the things of god themselves deem the qua who are past opinions and know him that is true and are in him that is true and the truth it self knowing also themselves to be of god and that the whole world lyes in wickedness ioh to be but where themselves are namely in their own vain imaginations and opinions and damn down also to hell it self those our opinions as they call them which are the only plain pure infallible way to eternal life as that deformed monster so he calls it too which t.d in the next page of this epistle and in his first narrative sprinkles into the name of quakerisme and i.o ore and ore and ore again in his contra fanaticos into those of enthusiasme fanaticisme nescio quid and as many more as come at last to vere nihil or truly nothing
next thou promisest thy reader and no more then thou sayst also shall be performed viz
a true account of the discourses so much of them as was argumentative and pertinent to the questions under debate or as tis in thy title page a true relation of what passed in three disputations apr



between thy self and three qua g.w.r.h
s.f

rep hadst thou entitled thy true account true relation thus viz
a false account a false relation thou hadst sav'd thy self the labour of one lye at

least for then thy title had been as true an account of thy book as thy book is not a true but a meer counterfeit account of the disputations but as tis thou hast told a lye more then ordinary which hath its being as a lye from no other clause so much as from that term of true thy work being as will appear not only a very broken and decrepid but also a very untrue and false relation of those affairs it pretends to relate to so that by saying true here thou hast spoken falsly whereas hadst thou in stead of true said false thou hadst in so doing said no other then the very truth

in which true relation of those discourses as thou falsly callest it how well thou hast quitted thy self as to such an honest and true account as is here so faithfully promis'd any honest man that was then present may see when as
set aside thy own large and lax

answers

set aside thy own confessed enlargements of the said lax and still as mouldy though answers with thy often long let me add's





the whole of what passed from all us three in all three of the discourses which lasted about seven or eight houres apiece is anatomiz'd well nigh all away or at least epitomiz'd into so small a pittance as may be read over if set close together in less space then the seventh or eighth part of one

and howbeit thou wast dealt with and measured back to from us more by weight then by multitude of words wherewith for the ignorance sake of common people as thou sayst whereby thou mayst see what a people thou hast whose life lies more in thy words then in christs works thou chosest to us as seeing thou must say somewhat as thou sayst and no matter what say or let us have all the talk to the prejudice of the cause thou defendest yet were we not so far behind thee as to number as thou seemest to set us in thy curtail'd account or else the more shame still to thy self and thine who cried out so often to us that we had all the talk and took up all the time nevertheless thou therein takest about nine parts of talk to thy self and allowest us the tythe then which thou knowst the qua had rather have just nothing insomuch that such as are more ready to believe thee then truth may well think by thy crowding us all up into such a corner of thy account thy other tales to be true thou so often tellest for thy credits sake concerning our mouths being stopt our being silenced our having nothing to say our sitting down as astonish'd and


as if it had been with t.d as twas with christ when the scribes were silenced by him so that from that time forward none durst ask him any more questions being so astonisht at his vnderstanding and answers matth


whereas who was as likely to have seen it as t.d discern'd no such thing among any of us as being silenced and having our mouths stopt from having any thing to say save only that we were often silenced

and stopt from uttering that we ever had to say by the wicked ragings of thy turbulent spirited people who were ever foaming out their own shame and casting up mire and dirt in a restle's manner till we were silent when uttering any thing whereby they perceived thee likely to be hampered

nor know any of us that were astonished at any thing that was seen in t.ds
disputes more then ordinary save the bruitish stupidity of some of his which though he sayes he blushes not at himself in his epistle to the second pamphlet but is so far from being asham'd of that as he two or three times own'd them audaciously before so he there professes if all the world could hear his voice he would confess as his faith to this day yet know some asham'd and astonisht at his sottishness therein more especially those two or three which shall name only here being to examine them viz his holding it with t.r that tis a doctrine of devils to preach a possibility of mens freedome from sin in this life
his saying that david when he was guilty of adultery and murder was not in a condemned state but in a justified estate that pauls own righteousness and so all the saints righteousnesses inherent are christs and no other then what they receive from him and he works in them and serve though not for iustification and right to the inheritance yet for sanctification and to make meet for possession of it and yet are no other then dung and filthy rags
as for any astonishment unless it were at the grossness of these other of thy absurd doctrines and thy own impudent persistance in them know none in any of us

but tis like t.d thou wast concern'd on the account of thy prayer thus to relate our mouths to be stopped thou tellst the world
that after a brief

account of the occasion of the dispute and after a short prayer thou mad'st for a blessing on the meeting which as short as it was will be long enough ere it be heard considering first that god hears not sinners and secondly that the things askt were not according to the will of god for as one of the two grand petitions of it was that we poor wretches might be made to acknowledge the light in us to be darkness which we never have done nor shall do trust any more then its utterly unfit we should for we know its the eternal light of the lord iesus christ and the only true light that leads to eternal life so the other was that our mouths might be so stopt that we might not say any thing which two petitions as we did not joyn with thee in thy putting up so since thou sawst thou purst up in vain there being no answer to them from god twas as vain for thee in the account

of thy prayer to set them down whereupon or else upon some other occasion thou forbearst it which that it might not seem altogether unanswered as hear say it was we have now and then such a showre as this sprinkled up and down here and there in thy account of the dispute that we were silent had nothing to say sate down astonisht and had our mouths stopt

and as said above if there were all we said that thou sent down though as it stands in that cursory way thou renderst it in it stands strong enough against thy pitteous pellets and poor replyes it might also seem true that as thou prayedst and mad'st intercession against us so it fell out indeed viz that we were sometimes silent having well nigh nothing to say for of about twenty houres conference that was held between us three and t.d in those three daies nine or ten whereof may well be supposed to be ours thou down to us as much as may be spoken over in about half one half hour or in half a quarter and yet entitlest this thy diminutive doings a true account of those discourses a true relation of what passed and yet in all this thou art so far from blushing or being asham'd that though g.w truly and justly charg'd it on thee in his book how thou wrongedst us by laying down things in our names which we never spake and diminishing from our words and making false in the epistle of this second part to the same tune thou impudently declarest that howbeit thou art come upon the stage once more not without a blush yet tis not as one ashamed

of thy doctrines nor yet as one conscious to thy self of wronging the qua in thy relation of the disputes between thee and them either by laying down things in their names they never diminishing from their words or making false constructions of them which is enough well nigh to make a modest man blush to hear thee say in answer to g.ws
charge and yet not blush at it since its most notoriously evident to all that will see when they may thou hast both added to and altered by false construction and diminisht from our words to the absolute abusing of us to the world

altered thou hast and faultred fonly in that very thing wherein g.w instances as concerning justification by the righteousness of christ and his spirits working in us which the spirit calls ours which thou and so represent'st it to the world as if had said we are justified by such works of ours as are filthy rags as we confess all our righteousnesses wrought one of christ are but not any of those of the church which christ works in them as he did in paul after his conversion which thou mayst blush at thy blasphemy in calling filthy rags as if christ vvrought a righteousness in his people which is no better then an unclean thing· and filthy rags of vvhich more anon whereas said only by those good vvorks vvhich are vvrought by him in us and vve vvork in his povver and spirit did say t.d vve stand just before god by any unclean thing by dung and filthy rags indeed

the righteousness of christ vvhich is imparted to the saints and inherent in them by vvhich they stand pure in gods sight truly and not suppositively only dung an unclean thing and filthy rags but that is thy blasphemy who so rendredst it but we know no such rotten stinking filthy righteousness that christ hath either in himself or in his saints

also thou falsly construest and misrepresentest both g.w and all of us as if we asserted all men to have the knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdome of god for we say not that all know them and we know that thou know'st them not but that the kingdome or light that only shews them is in all men so that thereby they may know the mysteries of it though they do not
also thou most miserably misrepresentest my saying there are degrees among believer
as if had meant by it according to thy own muddy misty manner of meaning and supposing in that and many other matters that believers have a mixture of sin with their grace and so ex falso suppositis proceedest to make another meaning of thine own which is none of mine that some persons be justified which never did fulfill the law personally and rakest up an absurdity and fatherest it on me when tis thine own for deny thy imagined mixture of sin with the saints graces as a meer saying of thy own for grace and sin can no more together then iron and miry clay then light and darkness then christs true righteousness and the dung and filthy rags which thou supposest to be his also which can have no communion together cor
and deny any men to be justified or any of thy uncessantly saints in whose persons the law is not fulfill'd by the power of christ

also how guilty or not guilty thou art found of laying down things in our names which were never spoken by us in such wise as thou ventest them and so of wronging us by adding to our words to thee in thy own words of thy epist to the second pamphlet let any understanding man peruse thy first which occasioned g.ws
reply and he will find viz that thou art charged not in falshood but truly and justly by g.w charged of falshood in such passages as have many and credible witnesses if thou count thy own witnesses credible attesting them for shall bring them against thee even as thou thy self hast ranked them in thy own book and stand to that very testimony they therein give as to the tryal of this matter between thy self and me which if it may be heeded more then thy own single testimony against both thy self and all them also shall do well enough as to one of the archest accusations thou makest against me
to this purpose consider all people that t.d on his bare head accuses me s.f

of his first pamp of affirming and disputing it against him that ovr good works viz ovr own righteousnesses of which it was of old said and we say the same now not intending by that term ovrs any that christ works in us as t.d does but those we have wrought out of him that they are filthy rags are the meritorious cause of our iustification and

in the same place asserts the third question to be stated affirmed and prosecuted by me in very terms viz that ovr good works are the meritorious cause nevertheless the t.d if it be one and the same t.d who wrote the trifle call'd a true relation of the disputes and that remarkable narrative at the end thereof in
of the same foresaid pamphlet to the confutation of himself and in proof of his falsification of things in that other place not only affirms it himself but also proves it by his many credible witnesses of whom he sayes in his epistle to his second toy they attest the truth and in the epistle to his first thus viz
the gentlemen ministers and others in the margin are a few of very many witnesses of the terms of the questions agreed to by the qua and of other remarkable passages and matters of fact who will free me from the suspition of a partial relator that the terms of the third question were these viz
whether good works be the meritorious cause of our iustification which quoth t.d was expresly affirmed by them witness in the margin hen oxenden iob

barry tho seyliard ch nichols ministers which terms say are quite diffeferent from the other good works which are only christs without that term of ovr added to them being one thing and ovr good works clearly another especially ovrs that are filthy raggs so what need further witness to prove t.d to have added to and altered our termes and wronged us by misconstructions for the world has it under his own hand which evinces him to have done so yet he sayes to his reader

as to false construction of their words if thou thinkest it worth while to compare my false and this mans g.w true construction either thou seest not with mine eyes or thou wilt see they have no occasion to complaine

rep
to which say if he see with thy eyes indeed then its like he may see no cause we have to complain of thee for thy eyes are set the wrong way to see any evill in thy self while they are not zach as all israells as one man are towards the lord in his light which only shews to the evill doer his evil deeds but are set rather to watch against the children of it for evill thy eyes are in tuts talpae in alienis linces blind at home and quicksighted the contrary way abroad if they were not thou could'st never spie so many spots among them that walk in the spirit and so few of those foul faults that are found among thy fellow walkers after the flesh but if any readers be minded to see with their own eyes and not thine they'l quickly see thee to be what thou art with whose weak sore and sorry eyes some of sandwich whose seer thou art do see more then with their own so that if thou once say'st thou seest what thou but surmisest and supposest they as i.os
juniors are respectively to himward are extempore stupified into a satisfaction that they the same whether they see it yea or nay so as to become iurats into thy rasn iudgment and to sit down with no more then nil ultra quaero plebejus our minister teacher or doctor sayes so or so
but indeed as the papists have been long accustomed to drink all the wine they drink in their sacrament with their priests mouths who impropriate that element wholly to themselves so that when christ said drink ye all of

this they drink it all off giving the poor people none so our protestants have been so long accustomed to see with their priests eyes that they have well nigh utterly lost their own or at least the true fight and right use of their own and
perceive takes it for granted or else why saies he thou seest not with my eyes that his people should see with his eyes understand with his understanding take things in his sence be of his mind be moulded in their meanings after the image of his vain imagination but say to you all ye people of sandwich you must see with your own eyes as the just must live by his own faith or else ye will fall with your blind guide into the ditch and if yee come to see with your own you'l see we have cause to complain of both altering our words and adding to them though it be as to quantity but little thou hast added yet as to quality it is so much as egregiously wrongs us howbest must needs say so much for thee and that's the best can say to help thee with thy additions to our words are not by far so voluminous as thy ablations from them are thy rendition of our argaments is rude ragged wrong enough in all reason yet tis not so much by way of additanent as ablation and detraction as shewed above our discourses to thee whilst thy own to us are repeated generally by the dative are rendered mostly by the case being rehearsed well nigh totally all away

know thou say'st thou hast not from our words but that thy dimination of thy deceitfull doings is but an addition to thy falshood and no little aggravation of thy lies for which thy unfaithfull dealings with us and misrepresentation of those matters as well as for many more misreports into which the lying spirit hath spawn'd itself forth over pages of thy whole trifling pamphlet and especially throughout thy narratives annexed at the ends of both thy babbles so farr will thy pretended fence of a few gentlemen and false ministers be from freeing thee from the suspition thereof that all faithfull hearers of those discourses and impartiall readers of thy ragged relation of them will lay thee under the condemnation of not only a partiall relator but of a very also against the truth as to matters of account and not a few matters of fact about which thou abusest and the quakers both in thy cart accountative and in thy much more notorious narrative pieces of business which for severall remarkable follies of thy own therein expressed are as much as any that know ejdem farraginis meritoriously to be marked for a pair of white ones nigro carbone while they have a being under the sun which after a few more breif animadversions on thy epistles am yet in hand with shall address to take some remarkable notice of
thou say'st thou hast followed thy antagonisi step by step and omitted nothing that hath the least colour or shew of reason unless where thou makest a reference to thy former book to avoid repetition lest he should say that like a child thou skippest what thou canst not read
only thou confessest thou art not able to match him at his belinsgate rhetorick nor would'st thou with jonah as hot as the sun that scalds thee

rep thou may'st well say indeed in one or two senses thou followest him for with all the hast thou mak'st and the best leggs of reason thy ridiculously short reply to him stands and runs on thou neither reachest

nor overtakest much less get before or go beyond him but art found as far behind him in the understanding of the misteries of the gospell the spirit and the world come as the wild bruit beast of the forrest is behind the naturall in the knowledge of the things of nature and this world· poor vain man thou wouldst be wise and taking upon thee to teach those at whose be thy wisdome much more to sit down and learn and so thou sayst to
seeing you do not understand ile teach you in a matter wherein any but the blind may see by thy raw delivery of thy self in it thou hast not half learnt thy lesson thy self and wherein as thou hast not a little need of it so thou maist thy self possibly be taught a little otherwise by and by in its proper place and thou are yet but as the wild asses colt ranging in the wilderness snuffing up the wind of thy own wisdom yet there is a time werein thou must be taken tamed and brought to beare and made to see thy self to be as far short of as one in the fall is of him that is risen again into the innocency

thou followest the quakers as the egyptians did israel and as the dragon doth the woman cloathed with the sun that beares the manchild christ iesus breathing our malice flinging out a stood of falshood wherewith to cause her to be carryed away but thy charriot wheels drive on so heavily that though thou persuest at the heels yet thou never reach further then the heel which is all that the serpents head which is to be bruised by her avails to hurt yea the very earth it self shall be made to help the woman to swallow up thy flood of lies and blasphemies rather then they shall ere be of force for the as they have been formerly to overwhelm her
as for thy step by step alas poor man makes such steps to his feet as are much too strict streit for thine to tread and stand in where he is thou in that nature and wisdome thou yet abidest in canst not come there's a gulf between whether he goes thou canst not follow him unless thou loose thy life as thou art loath to do and dye with him and christ and all saints that death of the cross to thy own carnall will which while in little better then that woodden way wherein the papists prate of the cross of christ thou in thy vain mind art prating about thou knowest the power of not so much perhaps as many or at best little more as yet then the most of them so farr art thou from following who as paul did followeth christ not in an outward empty apish way of imitation or setting himself to do what he reads or heares christ did in which yet thou art farr short of following christ too but acting speaking moving living worshipping walking in by and from the same light and spirit as christ did which thou art farr from walking by that with and others thou for the letters sake which yet thou errest from rejectest it as no rule for thee to walk by
and as for that very kind of following him step by step thou meanest who talk'st as if thou had'st traced thy antagonist to a tittle left nothing of his book unanswered thou hast rather little or nothing of it at all for as in thy second part to the same tune there is fere nil dictum quod non dictum prius scarce ought said of that which is set down that is not in thy and that is not already answered by so that of a sheet and half under which thou seekest to shroud thy self from the force of his reply consists so much of references to thy folly the folly of which

foolish peice is by it self as well as by us manifested to all well meaning men that thou mightest as well have spared thy paines of putting out any thing under that name of a book at all and have said no more but so viz for a reply to referr the to the book of mine which book is a reply to insomuch that for all thy pretended care to prevent it every one that is truly a man will judge that like a child thou hast skipped what thou could'st not read so as to make any reasonable reply to

as for billingsgate rhetorick its more found among the scribes that are scolding scuffling and scrambling for such petty businesses as muscles and meer mouldring writings externall texts tritling transcrips letters points syllables triviall tittles and iota's the qua qui nucibus faciunt quaecun{que relictis who if they do earnestly contend it is for more substantiall matters the faith that was once delivered to the saints the light truth and spirit it self ye priests despise which were long before your letter text and scripture ye so scrabble for was at all in being
and whereas thou sayest thou wouldest not say that whether thou wouldest or no thou canst not be so hot as that light of the sun which now scalds thee and thy scolders about the scriptures for the more ye foam fret fume fight and labour in the fire of your own fury against it the more the sun of righteousness arises daily and shines out to the tormenting of you inhabitants of the earth that have in the dark night of your apostacy from the truth slain made merry over the witnesses of god both within and without you and the earth is filling more and more with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea and the angels who have the vials full of the wrath of god are pouring forth of the same not onely upon the earth sea fountains and seat of the beast and the river euphrates which hath been hitherto the chief fence of the great of babylon but also on the sun it self so that men and ye men called ministers above all others are to be scorched as with fire by the great heat thereof till ye rather your tongues for pain and blaspheme the name of god as ye now daily do who hath power over these plagues then repent from your deeds to give him glory and though all ye impenitent brood of the babylonish harlot band your selves together as it were with one mouth to blow out the light yet is it to as little purpose as if ye should go about to forbid the morning light from appearing when it begins to spread it self upon the mountains
thou sayest that which iob speaks of the thief iob
is true of the qua
if one know them they are in the terrours of the shadow of death
rep
that's false of us but true of your selves there is one knows both you and us before whom your faces will wax pale and gather blackness ere long while we stand with boldness in his presence our hearts not condemning us of such wicked designs and deceits as are found among your selves
that we endeavour to hide our meaning by doubtful words

rep ex

layes the same falsly to our charge but no wonder that thou accusest us of that when as christ himself cannot

scape thy censure in that kind for as thou blamest and belyest us here as endeavouring to hide our meaning in doubtful words so pag
pamp thou sayest it was an usual thing with christ to speak words of a doubtful fense and that his meaning may be mistaken when his words taken in the most ordinary and literal sense and so it would be if by every man we should understand him meaning as he sayes of every individual man indeed how can we look thou shouldst clear us who accusest him but if thou acquit him cease from thy accusing us as guilty for that which if twere as surely as tis sure it is neither christs nor ours at all but your own common course and evil guise must needs as thou handlest the matter conclude christ himself under the same guilt together with us but in truth so far as

to peddle about the things of god with words of an uncertain and doubtful signification and when mens opinion is shameful and dishonest to dawb it over with deceitful covers and colours not to speak it out plainly to mangonize it in speeches sewed and patcht together on purpose to darken their councel by words without knowledge to beware of nothing more then least they should understand and be understood so far as to hide their councel by doubtful words so far as to speak one thing and mean another to make a shew in words and intend no such matter as they make a shew of so far as not to mean as men say is a matter justly lyable to the censure of hypocrisie and dissimulation we not onely clear god and christ and the spirit whom thou chargest as so doing while thou saist

pamph the the meaning of their words cannot be as the letter doth report it was usual with christ to speak words of a doubtful sense
salvation is offered or tendered by god to such as he never intends it to

pamph
but also are our+selves as clear from the guilt of it in the sight of god as capable to make it good out of your own that your selves are the men who are most deeply faulty in that particular

thou sayest thou hopest the reader will not be byassed by our seeming humility sith pride may be the root that bears that branch voluntary humility is the effect of being puft up by a fleshly mind
rep
true enough that pride bears the branch of meer seeming humility but among no men more then such as are used in rime as the priest or clark reads a line at once to them to sing to the tune of lord am not puft in mind have no scornful eye when yet for all that profession of humility they are puft up more proud and haughty scorners and dealing in more proud wrath against the righteous then such as never heard of such a thing as humility from a letter without as many heathens have not save what they have seen from the light of god and christ within themselves and among them that under the lowly titles of ministers or servants mount up into the lordly titles of masters reverend sirs under the disguise of servi are indeed no less then masters of all and domini dominorum terrae

thou tellest us alluding to a saying of the bishop of concerning

the protestants that if the qua have orthodoxos mores an orthodox conversation yet they have haereticam fidem an heretrodox or heretical belief

rep
herein thou shewest thy self to be as well as in other things one of the blind grand children of that blind papistical bishop who can'st not discern how impossible it is that an orthodox true right or good gospel conversation should proceed from an heretical or false faith silly man does not true faith purifie the heart and life work by that love which works no evil give victory over the world with the lust thereof and does any perfect purity of heart or life any true love that works no ill any victory over the world any truly good manners righteous works holy actions honest or godly conversation flow from an heterodox unsound untrue dead heretical false faith is not that a dead and unprofitable faith and such is yours who deny any perfect purging from sin in this life which doth not avail to the purging of the heart and life which overcomes not the world and is not all purity and love and victory over the worldly lust the necessary effect of a true faith and of that only and no other and can there possibly be a bad false faith where there are truly good works and an holy life in thy yielding here that the qua have a right conversation thou not onely givest thy self the lye in other places where thou accusest them as wanting not having so much as moral honesty as
pamp and
of the narrative but also to the proving thy own faith consequently to be false evincest the qua
faith to be true and not heretical for good manners and a righteous conversation cannot flow from a false or from any but a true living justifying faith or belief within aud if the heretical faith for so ye will needs call the true one bring forth the right life and the orthodox for so ye will call your own fruitless one be seconded with and shewed by a prophane conversation then give me our heretical and take you your orthodox belief unto your selves give me the faith that purifies works no ill gives victory over sin and is both proved and perfected by good works shew me thy faith without thy good works will shew thee my faith by my works for where the life is right the faith cannot be amiss and while the life is crooked corrupt and rotten the faith is not pure right nor sound yet know the clergy will needs count the qua
faith heretical let their life be never so innocent being themselves most in love with that faith in christ if they could find it our once that can allow and assure them of not onely salvation from wrath when they dye but while they live also a vain conversation and no little liberty to sin
thou say'st layes the most innocent truths under the odious imputation of antichrists deceits

rep
if those of thy antichristian deceitfull doctrines with sees down as thine at the end of his reply to thee

are the most innocent truths with thee that we may be delivered for ever from embracing those as truths shall be my earnest desire and prayer to god for myself and all men to whom wish deliverance from darkness and deceit it self and from delsion and damnation for sure am the contrary to those however own by

thee because of the blindness of thy heart are the most innocent truths of christ

thou tel'st thy reader thou trustest he will be confirmed in his bad opinion of the quakers
rep
here thou confessest thy opinion of the qua which thou seekest in thy first book to beget men to and in thy second to confirme them in is a bad opinion out of thy own mouth from thy own pen art thou judged as no minister of christ but an evill doer oh thou improfitable servant art thou sent of god are not all that are indeed sent of him as thou in word pretendest only to be sent to turn men from bad to good and to confirm them in those good opinions yet behold trusts that the people to whom he ministers will being by his writings converted thereunto be confirmed in their bad opinions of the qua
can more be done by any man in discovery of his own folly nakedness not to say iniquity and wickedness to all men then is here by was there ever the like seen save among such ministers as are like to himself that a minister should confess to all the world the end of his endeavours to be the converting of his hearers and readers to bad and the confirming them in their bad opinions yet thus writes to his reader trust thou wilt be confirmed in thy bad opinion of the qua
herein thou justifiest the qua as no such bad people as thou would'st render them to be at other times for if they were so indeed it were not a bad but a good because not a false but a true and iust opinion to think so badly as thou speakest of them but since thy own self stilest it a bad opinion of the qua which thy care is to confirm men in to think ill of them it evinces them not to be such evil ones for if men be bad indeed its a good opinion to deem them to be bad and to think of them as they are yea because the devill is bad a lyar a deceiver he gives the devill but his due and does well speaks and thinks well who has that good and true opinion that he is a wicked lyar and deceiver and who speaks and thinks no better of him then he is but if it be a bad opinion to think ill of a man and to be of opinion that he is bad and naught it must needs be that that man is good else twere not bad but good and just to judge him bad the goodness and badness of every opinion consisting in no other thing then in the truth and falshood of it respectively and the badness of a mans opinion about another man arising ever from the goodness or innocency of that other man lie thinks badly of
indeed were the qua such bad men as thou belyest them to be and had'st thou said thou wilt be confirmed in thy opinion of the badness of the qua thou had'st then spoken according to what thou now evilly and falsly thinkest of them and also the opinion thou seekest to confirm men in about their badness would be as good and thy endeavours to confirm them in it as good as ours are who because the priests are generally vile and naught do endeavour to bring people who are into the false and bad opinion of them that they are good and men of god ministers of christ and such like when its nothing less to that good true and right opinion of them that they are but ministers of mens making and men of sin and not of god

but th the qua are excepting such as are so named for comming among them who are no more of them nor owned by them then all they

are israel that are called israel an innocent honest iust righteous pure peaceable people and thou say'st its a bad opinion of them to think of them as ill as thou would'st have men in that as caiphas the priest of old not of himself but as he was ordered unawars to speak more truth of christ then he himself was aware of thou hast said truly and judg'd thy self as an unjust and evill doer in begetting in peoples minds bad opinions of good men and justified the qua as a generation of iust ones against thy will

thou say'st thou shalt blow away the dust the qua raise with their feet
rep throwing dust in the aire casting mists· and thereby blinding men from seeing the light and gospell that's the work of demetrius the silver smith and his companions who by the craft of holding up false worships had their wealth and not of paul the qua who are men of like occupation with him these make no trade of preaching much less of hiding the gospell as ye do but seek to publish it freely and what in them lyes to make it without charge
thou shuttest up thy epistles to thy reader with thy short prayers to this purpose that men the qua may proceed no further but that their folly may be manifested to all men tim

and that we henceforth be no more children tossed too and fro with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ is the earnest prayer of thy servant for iesus sake that thou maist not know the depths of satan as they speak rev
but maist hold fast that doctrine which thou hast already
is the prayer of thy servant in the work of the gospel

rep thou art very full of these ejaculatory supplications but thy ejaculations against the qua be ever too short to enter into the eares of the lord of hosts to obtain ought of that thou desirest thou maist save thy breath and keep thy darts to thy self they do but reflect back upon thee dream what thou wilt in the darke as to thy audience and acceptance we know as well as he who eyes christ opened heretofore ioh to
that god heares not sinners much less such as thou art who not only beleivest thou maist but even must sin also while thou livest and so regard'st iniquity as to plead against those as broaching of the devils doctrine who plead a perfect purging and freedom from it in this world
wert thou a worshipper of god and doer of his will which none doth while he sins though thou dreamest men may be in a justified estate while committing of adultery and murder he would heare thee for his spirit would then guide thee to aske according to his will and such things only as are well pleasing in his sight and to make intercession for his saints and not against them as thou often dost and thou should'st know also as they do that thou hast the things thou desirest of him ioh
but poore wretched

man that thou art its now quite otherwise thy sins lye at the doore and shut out thy cains sacrifices from comming up as incense in the sight of god so that thou fallest and loosest daily more and more for all thy prayers the qua both have and will proceed yet further and by the wisdome of god in them will both the lyars the mouths be stop't at la and thine and thy fellows folly be manifested to all men as that of old iannes and was who in their corrupt minds withstood and resisted and the truth tim

and while thy self and all that heed the wind of thy doctrine unless ye take more heed to the light within shall be henceforth as ye have been hitherto as children tossed too and fro and driven like the weathercock which way so ere the wind blowes and turned about as the priest and his parish ever hath been into what posture mould or mouldy religion soever the times happen to settle in the qua who are stated on that corner stone ye builders refuse on the su the rf christ the light of the world and life of all that hear his voyce will stand upright and not fall nor be about any more by the of the shepheards that have driven them from mountain to hill in the dark and gloomy day nor catcht by the cunning craftiness whereby the clergy lye in wait to deceive but know not so as to own or yet so as to scn and disprove the depths of satan as they speak and when thou and thine shall be forced to let go what ye have and and hold forth for the doctrine of god by tradition from men the qua shall hold fast what doctrine they have already learnt from god himself and shall not in that thy complementall form of words who as the old servus servorum doth when that he may be is that he more desires subscribest thy self thy servaut in the work of the gospel for sake while thou art indeed one of those master ministers that serve for filthy lucres sake against both and his gospel but denying your usurped mastership be made able ministers of the gospel or new testament not of your dead letter but of the life and spirit and speaking the truth in love and not lies in envy and hypocrisie as ye do grow up into him in all things even into his likeness and the image measure and stature of the fullness of him who is the head even christ into whose likeness though ye live like the devill here ye look to grow in the world to come only and not before

thus far as to thy petty pair of painted prologues and as really as seemingly pious apologies or epistolary prefaces to thy two paultry pieces

now as to thy two more notorious narratives whereby as by the epistles on the one so thy two butterflies are on the other side as with so many wings born up and furnished to fly apace through the world that is in love with lyes
shall need to say the less to them by how much some of the many lves that are laid down are already laid open to the view of all in his reply thereunto stiled the devil by l.h who together with my self and others by name as well as all the people called qua are most egregiously abused and belied therein
nevertheless since thou art so impudently obstinate in that course of prating printing out of lyes as to this day rather to justifie thy self then which would farr more become thee to judge thy self as an evill doer in so doing that all such as have not themselves to be deluded by thy deceitfull doings rather then to know the truth concerning the qua in such matters wherein thou as falsly as accusest them may beware of beleiving thee any more as many do by implicit faith shall give the world a further tast of that light treacherous and lying spirit which speaks in thee as it did in the false prophets of old who blinded the peoples eyes with their many from receiving the truth the true prophets told them which lying spirit proves them sufficiently in whom it is how ere they may stile themselves so as thou dost to be no true ministers of the gospell
report said the old lyars of ieremie and we will report it raise but a lye and wee'l send it abroad farr and neer so fee
of his second narrative appeares to have certain emissaries and earewigs that go out and gather what unsavoury materiall's they can rake out of the excrements of the qua and such dunghilly stuff and lyes and bad constructions of good actions as are either made by himself or made ready to his hand by his agents he layes by him and trussing his tales together into two tractacles or nasty narratives as antickly annexes them as appendicular at the of his other fancies bagg and baggage fit for nothing more indeed then to sollow in the reare of such pittifull polemicalls as the two pieces are they are annexed to
thou stil'st the materialls of thy two narratives remarkable passages and matters of undoubted credit

rep remarkable they are indeed and so much the more by how much they are for the most part either apparently foolish or flatly false and where true as some few of them are either miserably wrested and perverted to wicked ends or untruly used as premises from whence to inferr thy most abominably false conclusions and to confirm other men in bad opinions of the qua whereupon for the truths sake which

thouseekest thereby to bring into contempt shall here remarke the most remarkable of them and the rather first because in thy second title page thou so malepertly challengest any to disprove thee in the words of iob saying if it be not so now who will make me a lyar and make my speech nothing worth

because even in this very undefined span alphabet or nick of time wherein my enervation or discovery of the nakedness of thy two narratives is but now newly come under my hand and pen in order to its passage through the press whereat write this am presented with a third printed toy of thine t.d to the same tone stiled the lye returned to luke or a vindication of thomas danson minister of from the imputation of belying the quakers wherein thou sayst in his called the devils bow unstringed is impudent in denying severall matters of fact charg'd upon himself and others of his perswasion in thy two naratives and in representing thee the publisher thereof as a forger of lyes in which shuffling trifle or sorry shift of halfe a sheet for tis nor more nor better of meer wast paper as closely as thou conceivest thou hast lapt and laid thy self up as in a bed of lavender and in thy hissings and lyings against the light lyest hid velut anguis in herba among such silly seers as see with thy eyes yet thy new bed of lyes is too short for thee to lye long at ease upon and that half sheet of thine is a covering too narrow for thee to wrap thy self in from the wrath of god as well as too ragged and tottered and torn and thin if twere a whole one to shelter thy shame from the sight of such as see by the light of christ who view thee in all thy venomous ventings of thy malice through the thickest vail thou seekest to shrowd thy self under nor will thy certificates obtained procured by thy self published under the hands of thy pair of iohns viz io laigneile and io davis of dover one of which love so well as to tell him that if as the proverb is he play not iack on both sides twill be the better for him nor of thy pair of unminister like mr williams and wingfield who will never win the field with lyes against the children of the truth nor oft other thomas viz thy morris who is as very an infidell toward christ disciples till he see and feel our testimonies to be undeniably true as thy self and all the three other thomasses that are so ready to sweare what ere thou sayst nor the self contradicting testimony of thy trustee mr vinter minister of couewold nor any other of thy despicable disproofs so moderate the matter but that thou wilt appear to be a to those forgers of lyes who have brought thee into the praemunire of publishing to thy own shame what their heads have hatched and their pates prepared for thy pen and put upon thee to and publsh in thy folly to all the world as will by and by appear in the examination of each of thy lyes as thy lye laid down in thy last narrative

as to thy tale of hs sending his horse and man for me to be a appointed between him and russell a priest and that his man was seen to come out of dover on his horse overnight and myself sn to ride into the town the next morning upon the same horse which story thou tellest for truth with such confidence too that besides that forementioned common epethite thou givest to all thy lyes viz they are of undoubted credit thou here addest that it was manifest was for on purpose and that in

denying it we and have not so much morall honesty as to speak truth in matters of fact and such like

rep here as hath also done declare against that manifold piece of so predicated as a most manifest lye in every inch of it as having no truth in it from the head to the that can find one end thereof even to the other for neither did send his horse or man at all for me o're night nor did into on hs horse next morning but on a black hse plain enough if these had not been blind to be from hs white one and that in the afternoon too neither was the discourse between or appointed between and but and nor did e.b send for me but a letter to me only not knowing of my comming but desiring my answer only neither did know at all that any at all was to be till came into the town nor was there such a word spoken by in my that he would now leave the discourse to me nor did so much as by desire engage me in that though some few things said in it any more then he engaged me to come to those disputes at sandwich which saving thy lyes in that particular ore and ore againe repeated was just no way at all though hearing of a dispute to be there was there with other friends by all which remarkable passages whether thou hast not marked out thy self and thy more then the qua to be men that have not somuch morall honesty or to speak truth in matters of fact let all true men iudge nor is all that in thy last half sheet of any validity to disprove this which say and averr to be the truth as in the sight of god who will judge between you lya and us who as little as thou sayst we make of lying have herein said the very truth and shall be beleived against thy tattle notwithstanding the sleeveless testimonyes of russell and morris whose certificate which thou to put an end to the contest conclude nothing to the contradicting of whats here said by me
and thus into the pit of thy own digging for us art thou fallen thy self and in the same labo of lyes wherein he lay turking for the innocent hath the lyar lost and left him elf not a little in the lurch
thou tellest a tale that a dying qua at dover said he salvation onely by his good works and not from christ in witness of which thou bringest io davis minister of dover

rep thou hadst abused io davis as grosly as thou dost thy self but that see by his vnderhand testimony inserted in thy half sheet and his of thee he is willing enough to be so abused by thee and so am the less willing to vindicate him sith volenti non by offering in thy narrative to summon him in print as a witness of that which he himself had no otherwise than by from another for hereby thou da together with thy self to the iust censure of ignoramus whilst its well known to all save such as either are or else in enmity to the truth are free to be counted idiots that as in dei verae ecclesiae he is no true minister or witness of the word of god who stealing his testimony and the words he speaks out of the writings of the true prophets declares what himself never saw felt nor handled

of the word of life so vel in foro hominum even before men in their earthly courts of iudicature that man would be deservedly cast forth with shame as no lawfull witness against a living man there much less against a dead man not capable to speak for himself who should testifie it as an undoubted truth that he spake treason and from thence accuse all that mans kindred also to be traytors and yet confess he was no of his words but only heard a third man say somewhat to such a purpose and how iohn davis can be such a competent witness to the world of the words spoken by the dying quaker as thou set'st him down for or any more then a presumptuous intruder into or talker of what he hath not heard but only heard of my eyes which are not so dim but that can divine the divines to be in the dark to divine lyes to each other do not fee howbeit let every one see not with my eyes but with his own as to the case in hand
but when he was backbiting the qua to thee in that tale and tickling and scratching thy itching ears which as false tongues do love lying words and feed on meer fables more then truth thought perhaps as little as thou did'st of the likeliness of the quakers printing to be brought so openly on the stage about it as now he is and that with so much the more shame by how much he seemes to have play'd between both partyes and by that his second hand testimony to have two contrary turns at once viz hs and thine too or else its like he would have kept his say to himself but now he is justly left of the lord to manifest himself to be one that would fain seem to hold with the hare though he runs with the open mouth at her to devoure her having since he seemed to side with against thee in his last testimony obtained by thee and obtruded upon the world made himself obvious to the view of all to be a sidesman with thee in thy viperous spirit against us and one who would balaam divine us into the denomination of papists if he could tell how but as such as shew their teeth much seldome bite very deep so tis now the curst cow's have short hornes and your uncertain certificate can stand but for a cypher at most that signifies nothing but that ye would something in disparagement of the qua if ye could tell what
something it seems was affirmed by some body yea by the qua
brother who as their usually do isa
for christs name sake hated that hear gods word and tremble at it and are therefore in scorn called qua to such an effect as if the dying qua had said he look'd for by his own works and not by christ wherein if he doth not as many in and sandwich have done as bad bely his decreased brother for the sake of his own malice to the qua yet know he did at best as much mistake him as mistakes either blindly or maliciously mis me to the world as a looker for iustification without christ by my own works which have long since denyed as dung for those that christ works in me for howbeit shall not here meddle point blank to prove a negative yet thus much can say in disproof of your hasty my self who know his principles to have been no other then to expect salvation by christs works in him only and not his own was with that said dying qua in the time of that sickness whereof he died and

in as deep with him believe as that his meer fleshly brother was who hath so abused him yet heard him utter as nothing at all to that effect so not a little to the contrary and so leave this your tale of a tub as found it with the bottom out to take place in such hearts as are given ore to strong delusion to beleive your lyes that they may be damned for no entertainment will it find among such as receive the ve of the truth that they may be saved yea as thou sayst in
of thy half of that figment of your own viz that was sent for dover by l.h to the dispute with russell that came on other business will hardly be beleived on the word of a qua so say in thy own words of both this and that non entity of your own creating and of william wingfields of hs words also viz that those words were spoken by l.h as w.w sayes confdering the three testimonies that his words were otherwise and those also by the dying qua as thou them down upon the best evidence thou giv'st of it from either the qua fleshly brother or thy spirituall brother will hardly be beleived upon the word of such an envious quareller with the qua as thou art by them that know how little conscience that sort of men among whom thou art not the least make of lying against them and against the truth


another story thou tellest of a qua that came into the savoy church and made such a dreadfull noyse as seemed to be of the devill in him and so sadly afrighted the people that some ran one way some another to secure themselves from the danger they apprehended was near them and necessitated the minister then preaching whom thou callest mr hook to hold his peace as witnesses of which the said mr and mrs hook are cited

rep a palpable evidence if the devill had been in him as truly as ye suppose it how little of god is in your christian congregations and in your churches and ministers that the devils bellowing out of the mouth of one unarmed man could make the minister hold his peace and affright and put to flight his whole church before his face who so hearkens unto christ dwells safely and is quiet from feare of evill he is not afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the lord he is kept in perfect peace his mind is on the lord he keepeth himself that the wicked one toucheth him not he resisteth the devil and makes him flee and gives not place to the evill one but a token rather it is that the power of god was of a truth in the man who ere he was in that the trembled in the wicked whom he possesses were so astonished at his presence for hic murus conscire sibi nullapallescere culpa as this is the brazen bulwark and impregnable fort that true saints have such rejoycing in as all the devills in hell cannot impeach the testimony of their conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity they have their conversation toward god and all men so the sinners in sion are afraid and surprises the hypocrites and being conscious to themselves that no good belongs to them they wax pale at the sence of their own iniquities as if the devill were comming to fetch his own the name of the lord is a terrour to them a dreadfull sound of danger is alwayes in their and they are fear round about and a terrour eternally to themselves so that they are in great fear where no feare is as to any outward appearance or occasion of it much more

when the lord himself begins to roare out against them and thunder upon them out of sion is as terrible among the sinners as the devills is contemptible among the saints yea their own evills the wicked they flee when no man persues but god being in the midst of the congregation of the they are ever as bold as a lyn

thou tellest of a woman one mary todde a qua that at the bull and mouth while her friends were speaking pulled up all her cloaths above her middle exposing her nakedness to the view of all in the room
rep see if thou canst not get it by hook thou wilt get it by crook if thou canst but thou gettest nothing against us by either for as the tale that is testified by thy master and mistriss makes as little against us to thy purpose were it as perfectly true as its probably false in some part of it at least for cannot learn that there is at lord such a one as that is owned as a friend among the qua
so this

thou the qua in above was done by one that was a rom and not a qua whose abominable the qua whom thou callest her friends are more at with then thy self nor will thy in the margin thy cresset crurgion cure and thee from the censure of a false accuser of the qua to whose score thou down all the rudeness that by the rabble of their and the truths enemies is in absolute hatred of both them and it acted ever and in their assemblies
and albeit thou innest over this thy and business in thy last piece of work of half a by the certificate of iohn as thou didst bolster it up before by th cressets testimony in thy narrative which as far as his envious assertion will assure assures thee who very condently on thee to assure the world thereupon that the quak at lond acknowledge the said to be one owned and by them here contrariwise affirm whatsoever some certain qua that under that name shrowding themselves to do mischief to the truth as the false brethren did of old by whom paul was in peril might say to that the qua in london do disown and deny both and her ill carriage in that particular so that instead of mending thy ill matter thou hast but made it worse and redoubled the lye thou wouldst have lickt the lyars whole of
thou tellest of a qua that at on a lords day while the psalm was singing gat up into the pulpit with his hat on his head and serting his breech upon the cushion fell to sewing

rep a great piece of business for a man to be so sharply censured for as he was who did that
our princes and priests in these dayes have forgot that the lords prophets of old were moved to do as strange matters as that or any other thing that is done in the spirits motion in these dayes by the qua as a sign to a wicked and adulterous generation when the lord being wearied with the multitude of their sins began once to loath their most solemn sacrifices and to defile all the coverings of their idols and to slain the pride of all their fleshly performances and to no pleasure on their best observations and and to snuff at their sacred services as at a stink+ing smeak coming up into his nose and to turn the songs of their temples into howlings and to cause children to oppress them and very women to rule over

them and to stir up the babes and the base ones to behave boldly against the honourable and antient and to cut off both the head and the tail of a people even the antient and honourable rulers which are the head and the prophet that teacheth lies which is the tail and to upon their faces and that's more than a mans breech upon a pulpit pillow even the dung of their meetings and to sweep both one and t'other away together and in short to throw no less then shameful spuing upon all their glory

doth this offend you that the servants of the lord are now made signs so far as to sit covered in your in reproof of your singing davids psalm with spirit in such meeter as h.t.s elizabeths fidlers have moulded them into and in manner as some priest clark or sexton sayes them lineatim by a line at a time before you lord am not puft in mind have no all night wash my bed and much more to the same tune wherein most of your people mock god and sing more lyes to him than whilest they are as and as ere they can look and far from making their beds swim and their eyes gush out with tears for sin that they rather are both full of daily adulteries and defiled with nocturnal uncessant uncleannesses and pollutions does this offend you that a man should sit and few upon a cushion in rebuke of sottish who limit the lords day which is an everlasting holy sabbath or from all mans own words works thoughts and pleasures by the seventh day which ye now is no more holy than another within the narrow lists of one day of the seven and not the seventh neither which god instituted for a time but the first onely as if ye were then onely and on the fasts of your own appointment for a day bound to serve god in some certain outward shewes and then at liberty to serve lust self flesh sin and the devil all the week beside doth this offend you that as an ecce signum any true prophets tayl should come neer the cushion over which the prophets that teach lyes who are the tail lean and lye talk for money and do their business in order to the getting in of their gain from their quarters and follow their calling twice thrice a week and work upon their which unless they would come freely to give what freely they have received and speak more truth than they do is not half so honest as that of a taylour sewing of a garment

do these small matters which yet as despicable as they are in your own eyes are of more moment to you than ye are aware of offend and occasion you to stumble ye priests what if ye should men made to go naked and sit naked upon your and annoy them with very dung before you for a sign to a seemingly seed of serpents whose own which they count gain is as very dung in the sight of god such a one would be a greater in thy eyes t.d and of thy offended fellows yea behold ye despisers and wonder and perish such works and strange acts as these is the lord working in your dayes the mystery of which ye can in wise believe though ever and anon done in the sight of yea how have many been pressed in spirit to pass naked into your and streets in cities and towns and to do what ye deem defilement as signs from the lord to shew the

nakedness and shamelesness of this most impiously impudent and impenitent generation of professing priests and people who are apparently as in letter and increased with goods and needing nothing of christs own councel light in their own consciences not knowing to be poor and wretched and miserable and blind and naked and yet all this and much more no more than was done at the lords command of old by the prophet which was a fool and the spiritual man that was mad in the eyes of the blind priesthood of that age wherein he lived witness isaiah who went naked and three years for a sign and wonder to egypt and aethiopia isa
and ieremy who brake a bottle in tophet in token that the lord would make iudah as tophet jer

and put bands and yoaks on his own neck and sent yoaks to several kings as a sign of the slavery they should come into jer
and ezekiel who was dumb and bid to eat and drink with quaking and trembling to mingle his bread with mans dung and made to mingle it with cow dung in the sight of israel as a sign of that defiled polluted bread they should eat among the gentiles and to burn a third part of his hair and smite a third part of it with a knife and scatter a third part of it with the wind and bind a small part of it in his skirts to shew the famine sword and dispersion of israel and salvation onely of a few ezek

and dig a hole in his house and remove his stuff in their sight eze
and hosea that was bid to love an adulteress and a harlot


another example as thou callest it as remarkable as this thou sayest was in octob


where on a day of publique the parliament major aldermen common councel and officers of the army being met together to hear dr homes mr caryl appointed by the parliament to preach before them two qua made a great disturbance in the very presence of authority

rep by the humane it seems of the parliament themselves two ministers of mans making were appointed to preach before them and by the divine authority and power of god himself two of his sending were appointed and pressed in spirit to bespeak them in his name to another purpose then that of those of their own chusing for whereas they had chosen to themselves such as should prophecy to them not truth nor right things but deceits and such smooth things as were pleasing and suitable to their dainty dreams sweet sacred solemnities fained festivities vainly hoped unities of that joyful day the lord had chosen seers who saw beyond all this and divined a storm through all their draw near upon them but to these seers and prophets they said as the same seed did to the same sort of seers whom god sent of old to a rebellious people lying children that would not hearken to the law of the lord see not prophecy not soft and gentle and not right and rough things are agreeable to to the duty of this day the qua speech the words whereof have set down in the margin

referring both thee t.d and the sandwich doters

on thy to a printed sheet by tho simmons at the bull and mouth stiled the prophet approved by the words of his prophecy coming to where ye may read the residue of the message from the lord in that place of the popish priests consecrating falsly called in london on that day was deemed such a disturbance as was punisht with an orderless imprisonment by the multitude at the present ratified by the rulers order when they were more at leasure from their voluptuous feasting which iniquity of appointing men to preach to them in their own wills and time whether god appoint them yea or nay of despising the true prophets true words and trusting in the fraud of the fulse ones and in their own perversness and staying thereon isa
was then unto them as it ever was to the same generation as a breach swelling out in a high wall whose breaking came suddenly as at an instant for by the of the same month they who were so hand in hand against righteousness were turned tail to tail against each other for their wickedness yea the lord spared them not but brake them as the breaking of a potters vessel that is broken in pieces so that in the bursting of those brittle potsheards of the earth there is scarce found a sheard of so much as to take fire from the hearth or water withal from the pit

now as to the very great thou sayest they made this is but the old tone of the teachers and the wonted of that ministry thou belongest to that cannot stand nor subsist of themselves without leaning for encouragement defence assistance and maintenance to humane laws to prop them up in the propagating of their meer humane gospel who like the women that having no better shift than to cry whore first are ever hideously bellowing out against the qua to the tune of heresie heresie disturbance of the ministers to the magistrates so that if any qua come quietly in and speak or do but ask that reason which every christian is bound to be ready to give of his hope to every one that asketh him in meekness and feare they strait call out to have them punisht as the iews neither did act

nor do at this day which said ministers being in propriis talpae in alien is linces are more towards the good behaviour of one qua quietly questioning with them or saying any thing to them soberly that is of god then the misdemeanour and tumultuousness of twenty of their own unquiet spirits stirred up by the devill to call us quaking doggs to break windows and bring in to fight and such like beastly and behaviour in our solemn assemblies till they are wearied with their own pains towards us and our patience towards them under it as well while we are speaking as we are moved of the lord in our own allowed meetings as in theirs witness their leading a bear through the place where the qua were preaching publickly at hith and also the rudeness of some of those that are under thy own tuition t.d at sandwich and belonging to the flock thou there feedest or rather feedest on who when my self and many others were publickly met in quiet in a place of our friends procuring shrew stones and gunpowder squibs that fired among us not so as to move us to cry out to the rulers of disturbance yet so as to give good occasion

to the lord to permit though ye forget it a sad fire to fall out within the town no longer after then the next morning
thus ye men of sin make men of god offenders for a word and hate them as of old they did that reprove sin within the gate so that when any such stirrs arise upon occasion of the gospels preaching as did in the prophets and apostles days which the lords messengers now are no more accessary to as causes then they then were its still laid to the doore and put on the score of truth and the tellers of it which because none else will own it must hear it till against the foul mouth'd beast the lambs innocency be cleared as the light which till then may truly say of all mischief that falls out where he utters his voyce cum nemini obtrudi potest itur ad me the lambs is better then the wolfs when charg'd by him for troubling the water with only drinking at the fountain but the wolfs teeth are sharper then his and therefore the innocent must be devoured
and whereas to such like tales as thou hast told as abovesaid thou prefixest the conclusion thou inferrest in these words viz

what affronts these wretches offer to the worship of god is notoriously known
rep your parish worship is not so truly the worship of god as tis true that ye so call it but that of the qua who worship him in spirit and truth in the inner parts which ye are out of which those poor wretches your parish people are by your lyes instigated to offer such abominable affronts to as buffetings of men in and draggings of them their own meetings as are notoriously known all the land over is the true worship of god indeed which except ye repent in time ye priests and and own the truth twere better for you and them that ye had never been born then offer such affronts to as ye do but full well may ye offer affronts to our worship when ye stick not to do the like to your own rule of all worship even to that ye call the word of god for if the scripture which is a true writing of it were as truly the word of god as ye say it is ye bawlk not as occasion is to do despite to that witness the ungodly guise of those giddy heads about westminster who when by holding out the bible to them they were askt in the mid'st of their mad hurlings of mud and kennell dirt as they mostly do upon the qua in their meeting there to this whether they would do such despite unto the scripture which they say is their rule and the word of god ceased not to be dirt that their word of god any more then they did from dirting him who held it out to thorn
t.d
another of thy remarkable passages in the first narrative is of one of our friends who by a meer mistake charged one of your ministers peter domsell who was cleare instead of another who was guilty of it as slandering me falsely with taking pay from the pope

rep which mistake of one man for another though confessed freely and publickly by our friend which is more then for your many flat lyes against us we can expect ever to extract from you and thereupon with much ado professed by you all fit to be never more mentioned to him yet is not only reckon'd up by thee in print to the shaming of him if thou could'st but also to thy own shame of a single slip

multiylyed by thy lies about it into severall unsingle shifts and double dealings which thou falsly fatherest and fainedly fast'nest on him and me too

t.d
first thou say'st he pretended to say that he said from the lord as one immediately sent of him so to speak and yet was mistaken as to the right man whereupon thou concludest the qua as far from infallability in doctrine as in matter of fact
rep which is but a silly conclusion of thine if it had so been and contrary to thy own principles for if christ knew not iudas to be a devil and so him for his minister upon that mistake as thou little less then intimatest
for in truth iudas was no devil when christ chose him and yet christ was infallible in doctrine though secundum te who ignorantly so fanciest ignorant in that fact why may not a mistake in a matter of fact stand now with infallibility in doctrine t.d thou sayst holp him with a saying he said not from the lord but in the feare of the lord so that the people then houted at me
rep
for all the then and the still stout standing of thy rout of rude ones to the contrary still say the same viz that he not in thy pretended phrases of from the lord or as sent of him but in the feare of the lord which may be consistent with the mistake of one person for another or else tell me t.d for ad hominem now urge how isaac mistook iacob for esau and paul wot not that was the high priest when he term'd him a whited wall yet what a stirr what a ditty what a deale of do mak'st thou in aggravating that diminitive business till by the rash rendition of it thou render thy self as ridiculous as himself whom it most concern'd then did who like one that to kill a gnat which makes his nose itch strikes so hard as to make it bleed was so over obstreperous and frivolously fervent in his own defence from the offence of that fly and more would have been if for ye had not stopt him that he offended himself more otherwise by stirring up thy people to laugh more at that folly which then fell from himself then to lament the innocent injury which befell him as from us
t.d thou sayst that the reader may see how great a stress we lay upon small matters thou wilt tell him a true story which perhaps may move his laughter that a kinsman of offering to salute her she went two or three steps back with these words
have renounced the devill and the flesh long since prethee forbear that custome of the world and that these things thou thought'st good to add at the desire of some worthy persons that the world may take notice not only of the wickedness but of the of these peoples the qua principles

rep
this last part of thy first narrative is not a more true then strange story as ridiculously related as it is a ridiculous relation what if thy kinswoman refused thy offer to salute her at thy because she could not conscientiously close with thee

in the carnall course of that customary complement which in the world it self weares out now too and begins to savour far is it from the christian plus coloni quam aulici more of the clown then of the courtier must thou needs be so obstreperous

in print against her for it thou dost it to shew how great a stress we lay on small matters but thou shew'st indeed how great a stress thou lay'st upon the small matters and how bad a construction thou puttest upon the good intentions of thy own kinsfolks when they are as thou ironically term'st it
of that perswasion of quakerisme thou dost it to move thy reader to laughter at her and our wickedness and absurdity but if he be one whose heart is not among the wise in the house of mourning but among the fools in the house of mirth he will with laughter thereat take much more notice of thy own
thou thoughtest good though thy thoughts in it were not good at the desire of some worthy friends to do it a worthy peice of business indeed like thy self and worthy persons who desired thee so to do to add at the end of thy renowned narrative of remarkables as it were to pin the basket to bring up the reare and as some weighty substantiall matter to adde weight to the rest of that windy frothy husky chaffy stuff and matter of story with which thy book is abundantly stored

had'st thou been wise thou might'st have learnt of thy kinswoman to do the same that was undertaken for thee long since viz to forsake the devill and all his works the vain pomp and glories of the world so as no more to follow nor be led by them but now in this thy printed publication and so a passage at the very tayl of all thy merry matters and lying tales of the qua to move thy lewd more risible then animals to laughter at them thou hast rather vented thy own vanity to the advantage of the truth thou treatest against then disparag'd it having acted herein much below that gentility civility courtesie common humanity and ingenuity that becomes one that calls himself a kinsman and would be counted more then a common christian by not so much finding a great fault where there is none at all as a wrong rendring of that to the reader as some gross in which he to whom christs cross is not yet a riddle will read to be as great a good as thou mak'st a gross evill of it
of so slender credit is truth among its foes that if the least fault be among its freinds it shall be sooner found then find forgiveness on confession if it be but a weakness or mistake of one man for another by night its magnified into some impardonable wickedness or mighty mischief if it be but a mole hill that every wise man would step over and none but blind guides and their giddy guided ones who strein at the saints gnats and swallow their own camells can well stumble at its made a mountain which they cant see over if but a mot its sooner seen in a brothers ey then a beame by them in their own if it be but some pittifull passage not fit to be printed a narrative must be made of it as of some remarkable passage that can't be omitted if but as ridiculous a thing to relate as serious in it self it must be related to move fools to laugh at it but wise men will laugh most at its relator
t.d
as to thy conclusion of thy second narrative which is a desire of thy reader to peruse the qua
answer to the questions thereto annexed which were proposed to and answered by ioseph fuce whereto thou settest both his name and answers to them

rep say thus much to thee that howbeit thou hast set down so much

of fs return as neither thy silly self nor io corbet the priest who put forth the queries and was accordingly answered above two years ago by io will ever be able to render any reasonable reply to for if ye could have refuted them the press was as open for your reply to them as your bare narration of them and so much as will stand over your heads for ever as a testimony of the duncicall darkness and blindness of you both in the misteries of the gospell of which for silthy lucres sake ye do but fancy your selves to be the ministers yet either one or both of you two pers have done the best or rather the worst ye could to abuse both io and the qua and the truth by that counterfeit account thou t.d givest the world of those queries and answers that passed between priest corbet and ioseph fuce

for there were queries put by thy couzen corbet every one of which were at large and as to any likelihood of their being answered by you unanswerably replyed to by io.f of which thou bring'st out but eight

as thou bringest out not one half of corbets queries so judge may safely say not so much as the part of i.f his answers but only here and there some such broken bits and pieces of them as ye thought would represent them as weak and naked to mens aspect though indeed as as ye have rendred them they may well be left to stand against all your priestly prate and pedling pelting· at them
why did ye not seeing ye had a quarrell at them publish every inch of all his answers to the queries ye have set down yea why not all the queries and the whole of his returns to each of them together with your own replyes to those his returns that men might be undeceived by you that call your selves their ministers and take on you to be their masters so as to teach them truth since ye deem them to be deceived by i.f his doctrines and then ye had saved your selves from the guilt and censure of that guile and deceit that now ye are found in while ye are found shuffling and cutting picking and culling out here and there a leaving out such adjoyning sentences yea somtimes that half of the same sentence which being set down would have shew'd his true sence of the whole which ye scrue and wrest as far as ye can tell how into another then that intended by him expertus loquor speak what know having whether shall print it or no yet know not the whole entire copy by me of those queries and answers amounting in all to two sheets thy cutted account whereof comes not neer to the part of one
surely either one or both of you two brethren in iniquity t.d i.corb saw ye could not reply to them and so had made a swinging rod for your tayls and slasht your selves as foundly therewith also had ye put forth the whole truth which ye have not told the tithe of whereupon ye have thrust out only some meer fragments of it with as much manglement of them too as ye well durst make and with no other then this dribling answer of thine t.d of thy second narrative viz surely by these principles in conjunction with the rest in the book to which this narrative is annexed though the said principles remain as unrefuted as impossible to be refuted by t.d the qua have for ever forfeited the name of christians and are to be reputed heathens

t.d thou tel'st and that twice over viz in thy narrative and in thy witness reinforcing reply to a tale of saying the priests shall be destroyed by the people called qua

rep
but hath already so sufficiently disproved that in his reply to thy styled the devils how unstringed by three persons who as laid above testifie his words to have been otherwise and so prov'd thy witness will minister of word to be no minister of the word of truth nor such a godly minister as thou printest him out for who can joyn so cordially with thee in printing lyes that need say nothing yet that the preists shall be destroyed by the qua though h's words were not so is true enough here affirm it yet not by outward gan sword or carnal weapon but by the sword of the spirit or word of god in their mouths not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord zach
thou sayst in the second page of b's book or word of advice to the souldiers he bids them give the ministers or priests blood to drink for they are worthy
rep true enough that the priests will have as much blood as they are worthy of from the lord though the qua desire the salvation of their souls and bodies too if yet it may be and the destruction of nothing but that sin blindness and darkness which destroyeth them in both howbeit in the second page of bill's book unless there be another of his or of bur's
so stiled find no such words as thou artes est to be there on thy own personal knowledge and so all thy proofs of thy grand lye for ought see fail thee and lie in the lake together with it
many more absurd and foolish frivolous tales thou tellest that omit but two more of thy lying accusations of the qua more remarkable then all the rest of those remarkable passages of thy two for nothing more then the many lies thereof most renowned narratives remain yet to be remarked that all may see how thou and thy heard of hearers and drove of have not so much me al honesty as to speak truth in matters of fact which is the very fault thou chargest us with and the worse in thee sith turpe est doctori cum culpa red arguit ipsum
and then shall be at liberty to take a view of the many lyes of thy doctrine
two one whereof is prosecuted in thy last narrative only and the other more wickedly then wisely made and drove on very devoutly in both but especially in thy first without either care or good consideration or conscience truth or righteousness sense or reason fear or wit are these
that the qua intend to prosecute the promotion of their principles by that bloody way of persecution with the outward sword

that the qua are doubtlesly acted by the antichristian or romish faction and do drive on the popish work and papistical design and of qua become papists and further for this lye splits it self into two parts one concerning the qua in generall the other concerning my self in particular that i.s.f am probably and appear to be not only a rank papist but also iesuit holding complyance with the pope serving the sea of rome such like of which more at large by and by

rep as to the first of these thy two lyes of the qua it lies thus palpably ayerred in thy own words


the truth is the qua now declare their intentions to propagate their perswasions by the sword whereas they were want to pretend to so much meekness or peaceableness that they would hold neither nor sword
rep here's the charge an arrand lye yet a truth if four or five more lyes will serve to prove it if not men must take it for truth on no other then this because t.d who tels so many lyes that he deserves not to be believed when he speaks the truth doth falsly say so for thy pieces of proof which are too piteous to prove thy main false charge were they all true are as to the truest information that can get thereof every of them false charges and a pack of like to that they are brought in proof of
the first proof is this slender story
at a late meeting of the qua in hurst pierpoint in suffex he that undertook to be speaker called out to the priest who accidentally pasled by saying we will have you all down for now our day is come
the second this tale
and a qua in the parish nuthurst in the same did say to a godly person of good quality in that parish that he no more cared to kill one of the priests as he styled the ministers then he would to kill a dog
the third this wicked lye
and another qua
the minister of covehould a very worthy reverend man at his return from a fast and justled him upon the high way as he kept it his wife behind him and drew out his sword which he had by his side about half way which was a shrewd presumption that he intended the minister but that some neighbours that came from the fast coming up to them prevented it and they do usually give threatning speeches against the ministry their friends

in answer to these three here subscribe such information as came from the mouths or hands of sundry men living in and about these parishes or places t.d relates these matters of a truth to have been done and spoken in three or four of which are it seems members of those two parishes of nuthurst and covewold in such as follows

these three charges or slanderous accusations as they appear to us coming to our hands we who are inhabitants in the county of sussex near adjoyning to these places where the author saith these things were done one of us dwelling in one of these parishes which he makes mention of have a good and perfect knowledge of these men who are called quakers and that they are men of better qualifications then to offer such violence or to give out such terms as is here charged upon them
therefore for better satisfaction to ourselves as also for the sake of others who may be deceived in believing such things by giving credit unto them without a surer ground then because they are come forth in print to a publike view also from such a hand whom they might think would not be so dishonest as to be the author of things that are not true
upon these considerations and others which might be mentioned we undertook to search out the matter with some diligence that all who desire

may be truly informed and who have prejudice in themselves neither against one sort of people nor another because of names or differing in judgment as we have not our selves who are now about to satisfie of this matter that truth may appear and that every action may be tryed by it in and among all sorts of people

so for the first accusation which the author makes mention to be spoken at hurst he hath caused a lie to be printed as also the other two for there were no such words spoke nonly the friend that did speak some words from whence this report might arise might ask the priest of hurst what they would do if the powers of the earth should for sake them these words its like were spoken
and as for the second accusation and slanderous lie which he saith was spoken by a in the parish of nuthurst we whose names are here under written did go unto the man whom the author calls godly and of good qualitie unto whom he said these words were spoken to know the truth of this thing and his answer to us was as he and some others were drinking together there was one amongst them did say that it was no more sin for to kill a wicked man then a swine

though there was one who went under the name of a quaker who did dwell in nuthurst parish whom the man which the author calls godly and of good qualitie did say was the man that spoke these words above mentioned which are then what is printed yet this man he quaker that should say these words hath not dwelt in the parish of nuthurst neither in the county of sussex this two year and half and above neither hath he been in these parts of so long time as can be sufficiently proved and the cause of this might arise above a year before he went a way
and as for the third slanderous accusation the minister of cavehold which the author of this scandalous book calls a very reverend man we whose names are here under mentioned did go unto this minister of cavehold in sussex the day of this eleventh month

for to have him to set his hand against this scandal because we knew that there was no such thing offered by them from which this slander might arise and his answer to us was that there was three caveholds in and that it might be at some of them but he said that he knew the man t.d that set forth the book and that he had one of them himself and he said he would send to the man to enquire of him and if he meant cavehold in sussex he would give it under his hand that he was for there was no such thing done there neither to him

but we have great cause to beleive that this slanderous accusation did

arise at the first from the priest of cavehod in sussex or by his meanes as you shall hear for upon the day of the moneth this present year
at horsam in sussex this priest of cavehold in sussex with some other priests besides of sussex did meet at the in hsam aforesaid in sussex where many of their members and other people besides were gathered together as they said to keep it as a day of humiliation on fasting day among which robert adams and some other friends who are called quakers had freedome to go into the among them and when the priest of of sussex had done and come out of the pulpit one friend did speak somthing in way of desire to the priests to give the people called qua a publick dispute concerning tythes and other things that people might come to understand who were most in the truth whether priests or we called qua
so upon our return homewards after that we had rid about a mile one william field us one of the priests members which rid along with us on the rode about a mile and a half in which time priest vinter the priest of cavehold in sussex for so his name is george vinter and he had his wife behind him did overtake us as we rid together being in some discourse and this priest did bid robert adams call'd qua
ride out of the way and r.a said the way might be as free for me as for thee yet nevertheless in regard thou hast one behind thee will and so he did ride by the way upon which the priest did answer if had not one behind me would have the way of thee or one of us should lye in the dust and other threatning terms was given to r.a by one who was in the same company of the who rid up to us and this man did justle r.a on the way and did lay his hand or hands upon him justling him as he rid along
but after this we rid together in discourse about his laying violent hands upon r.a and other things till we came within about half a mile of their dwellings where we parted
but as for a sword r.a had none neither did he offer any abuse nor give occasion of any such thing as they have printed

this is the substance of the of this scandall as had it from humphery killinbeck who was the friend that was with robert adams at that time

something of one of the priests cheifest members taken by us humphery killinbeck from his own hand writing
a true coppy
comming from a fast kept at horsam overtook two men that had been at horsam called qua about a mile from the town and rid about a mile with them and then the minister of and his wife and other neighbours overtook them also but saw no sword any of them had nor think none of them nor the minister neither will he say that he offered him any did not see they did and tis easie to know whether they did or not
william field
another coppy from under the hand of another of the priests members

these are to certifie whom it may concerne that did heare the minister of cavehold say that robert adams a qua did ride from horsam and

that he did overtake him as he went from a fast and that robert adams did fall upon him in railing terms and did justle him with his wife behind him but he did not draw a sword neither had he any with him given under my hand cavehould of ianuary

by me thomas ward
another of priest vinters members a coppy subscribed with his own hand
thomas parsons one of the parish of in sussex not being above five miles from horsam did not hear of it neither by mr vinter nor by any other neighbour and do think it very strange that any such things were but should have known it
by me thomas parson
see t.d how your own parish people the very earth helps the church the woman that beares the manchild against your slanderons tongues and pens and opens her mouth swallows up the flood of lyes and falshood which that great that old serpent called the and satan casts out of his own mouth and the mouths of you his angels who fight under him against michaell and his angels against her that he might her if he could to be carried away with that flood of wrath which ye are ever warring against her withall
thou tellest of when thy very worthy and reverend man or minister overtook the qua and swell'd in high and lordly words against him in his lordly return from his lly fast wherein hower'e he might hang down his head like a for a few hours yet the bands of his were not nor his haughty heart so well humbled as it should have been thou talk'st of justling threatning speeches the qua gave when that was the gesture used by others towards him thou tell'st of a qua drawing his sword and intending mischief if neighbours comming from the fast had not prevented it by comming up to them whereas the man sayes there was no such thing done there nor to him and the very neigbours that came from the fast witness against thee that the qua had no sword at all
blush therefore as well thou may'st thou that sayst thou are upon the stage not without a blush but at what thou sayst not and be ashamed of thy abominable abuses as one that must once be conscious to thy self if any light be yet left in thy of wronging thy qua not only in thy relation of the disputes between thee and them but also in thy naughty nasty narratives of so many lyes and false matters of fact concerning them left the lord give thee over at last to stronger and stronger delusion yet both to beleive lyes thy self that thou mayst be damned and to bely the only true beleivers of the truth
now whereas in thy half sheet in answer to hw thou t.d saist thus it may suffice to let the world know thou hast the under the hand of mr vinter as thou call'st him minister of cavehould in sussex a very worthy and reverend man who asserts the assaults made upon himself by the qua and canst produce witnesses credible of that action and of the words therein reported and that they that know him can inform those who are ignorant that his word may be for matters of greater moment

rep much more might be said but as thou sayst the press being likely to make the business more publick then the market place what is above printed may for more have by me suffice to let the world know if yet thou have such relations under the ministers hand what kind of creatures thy credible witnesses are and how unworthy thy very worthy and reverend men are to be call'd ministers of the gospel and to have their words taken in matters of doctrine and soul who are found saying lyes to thee in secret of the qua and unsaying them to their faces and not having so much morall honesty as to speak truth in matters of fact nor yet so much trustiness neither to their own father of lyes as to keep his and their own councill without be wraying it when they have done as this cavehold reverend clergy man seems to have done by that testimony of his have here inserted and that contrary one to himself which thou say'st thou hast under his own hand and this may suffice also to let all men see who are not wilfully blinded what fruits follow the most solemn fasts of this generation of blind guides when they gather together after their devouring of widows houses and of poor goods for tyths for a pretence to make long prayers so that shall do no more as to that last piece of patch of t.d's putting forth having returned the upon him again which he thinks he has returned to l.h then having pluckt its wings turn the sting that stands at the tayl of that bawbling butterfly back upon himself and in short shut up this my return as to that in the very last words mutatis mutandis additis addendis wherein thou t.d concludest that thy as impudent as impotent rejoynder to l.h viz

so that upon the whole the publisher hereof s.f doubts not but that the wise will be able to discern between truth and falshood and will in their own thoughts be as farr from acquitting t.d and his companions whom l.h charges with lying as they would a thief at the bar meerly because he pleads not guilty to his indictment which is an usual thing let the evidence be what it will
and he doubts not but if they should revile in print again he may be excused if he make no other return then inhonestum est honestam matronam cum litigare i.e

and now as to thy generall false charge of the qua as complying with the papists and antichristian faction which is not thine alone but that of will
prinn tomb's also and of the priest of kendall brownsword answered in that particular by bur story and in a manner of the whole covent of against the quakers

rep should blush and be ashamed were in thy case to make such a

confident narrative of it and such an undoubted profession of my faith thereof as thou dost of thine and produce no more then two such pitiful proofs for it as thou dost and to send it abroad in print on two such lame legs as can help it are the stile

little more then a bare repetition of thy reasons after thee is enough to a right reader to render the urger of them reasonless and ridiculous enough in all reason

am out of doubt sayst thou they are acted by the antichristian faction
rep why so
a gentleman of good credit assured me that be met with an english iesuit in london the first lords day in june last one who was bred in cambridge and had been formerly of his acquaintance who after some shyness to be known at length confessed that he came over to propagate the romish faith and told him that there was a good honest people called quakers whom we jeer'd at that did their work at the second hand and he boasted much of the numbers that turned catholicks immediatly or mediatly by becoming quakers
rep both thou and thy men of credit will come to be out of credit ere long if thou crack thy own and their credit but a little longer so much as thou hast done hitherto
but
suppose it true that he assured thee so

suppose that true he assur'd thee of what then the papists dote as our priests often do in other cases that that will make for them which to any but such as discern not the signs of this season doth undoubtedly work toward their utter ruin therefore doubtlesly the qua either are or will turn papists
object
but many by becoming qua turn catholicks
rep
the qua are of the catholick church if thou wilt know as thou dost what catholick is but so are not the papists that are of no church but that of rome the church of rome is but a particular church as that of england or another national one may be but the catholick church is general and universal a church that was before rome was a church or a city either as some qua have oft asserted to friars and iesuits to the stopping of their mouths a church that had its being though the world sees it not nor knows it from abel to this day to which general assembly and church of the whose names are written in heaven and to the spirits of iust men made perfect the qua are come as the saints were of old heb
and so while romanists are but as ye are a bastard brood the qua are the truest catholick church that is in the world
gentleman that came this spring from st omars did avouth that he saw the iesuits there about four a clock every evening throw off their gowns and put on aprons and betake themselves to the exercise of handycraft callings some plaid the shoomakers others at the loom others kill'd and dress'd sheep and they did not stick to boast that under the disguise of such callings working as and changing place as they listed they served the romish church
and the head of the colledge told him that england never was in so fair a way of return to the romish sea since it broke off as now
and what hopes the papists can have unless from the encrease of qua
leave reader to thy determination

rep what news is this to any but nevices that iesuits in craft use han+dicraft callings that under that disguise they may serve rome but what follows hence

nempe similium similis ratio the qua are mostly handicrafts men and in that the iesuits and qua are alike the one can outwardly work with their hands a thing that our priests will never do till they must needs so can the other the one can make so can the other the one can handle the loom kill and dress sheep so can the other therefore the qua and iesuits are all one
rep
and so are all things as they have a being but as nullum simile est idem so nullum simile currit quatuor was a lesson that once learn't and t.d too but he can forget it for his own ends and so argue as accurately a comparatis to prove the qua to be as like the iesuits as ever they can look as the franciscan friar in his sermon a simili comparatis comparandis prov'd his beloved st francis to be as exactly like to christ as could be in this manner christ was born and so was st francis christ liv'd and so did st francis christ was on earth and so was st francis christ died and so did st francis christ went to hell and so did st fr in all which the man was very right but when he stretcht his simile so far in love to st francis as to say christ came back again and so did st fr nay now thou lyest quoth one of his hearers for though christ descended into hell as did also saint fr yet he came out again and so did not st fr but he is there still and ever will be
in like manner il'e yield to d's comparison of the qua and iesuits as far as is fit the iesuits are men and so are the qua iesuits are in christendom and so are the qua iesuits are preachers and so are the qua iesuits can work with their hands and preach too and so can the qua the more shame for our lazy lord beggars that are ashamed to dig but to beg are nor ashamed but if t.d strein his stuff so far upon the tenters as whereas the iesuits do also this to serve the church and in the heighth of his servent hatred to the qua to say the qua do so too shall leave him lying there as the fellow did the foresaid fryar saying no more but thus that what work with their own hands preaching qua do they do it as paul did who otherwise had a power to cease from working that they may make the gospel which our parish priests have long made such a gainful trade of to the cost of these nations without charge to the nations that yet own it not as those did of old ioh

and now as to thy second part to the same tune wherein thou cantest out aloud concerning my self who am not only more and immediately concerned in it but concerned also for the sake hold forth to clear my self
thou goest about to insinuate it into all people that his not groundlesly to be su'pected that comply as one with them with the pope or cardinals at rome as from some others more simple then it self so chiefly from that superque simple antecedent viz my some doctrines which are theirs
now since am one against whom there is such prejudice among all manner of people through the subtle sinister and sinful suggestions of the priests both prating and preaching and printing me to be in likelihood a papist a iesuit
so that can go no where among those of my own nation in any service to the gospel where am not so hit i'th teeth with rome and kissing the popes and such like toys that equity itself from my mouth cannot enter into many minds by reason of the iniquity of levi's lies which are in love with lyes bear with me yet a little longer in that folly of a few fools according to their folly though in so doing make my self for a while more like them then through mercy really am left being as else myself had much rather be in this case wholly silent they grow so wise in their own conceits as to take my total silence as t.d is very hasty to do in other cases
for that all the lyes they broach and for the truths sake load me with are truths indeed
the capital crime then which am by many priests charged with and which my holding some truths they hold at rome is by t.d made the cardinal proof of is that of popery of receiving a pension from the pope of complying with the antichristian faction with the pope and cardinals at rome the whole parcel of proof which that aforesaid is a prime part of is made up of many more particular ingredients compounded of several other simples whereof some are urg'd not only in proof of the main point or accusation but as accusations themselves of which some are true some false others urgd only as proofs of that grand crime am accus'd of

paper only he shall give me or if not shall take leave as as see occasion to leave out wherever it stands before my name and set only in its stead or any other mans name whether in this or any other part of his book when have occasion to mention any of those to whose names he sets it as he doth to some and not to some to shew his partiality and respect of persons which stands not with the faith of god and being on good grounds free neither to stand mastering up of them into whose service have never hired my self nor if they please to forbear it to me wards to own that title of mr to my self which some use so much to each other till it stinks t.d's book so much to me that am asham'd on't from any of them that were never any of my hired servants and howbeit once iure academico by as much right as such men as chuse to have it still done so to themselves in token of their mastership of arts had that half penny piece of honour of m.a printed to my name as t.d now hath in and that that past in times of ignorance let it pass without more mention or finding fault with it from my self and others yet if my self or any shall henceforth write or cause himself by pen or press to be inscribed either m.a or d.d or b.d and any reader in his ignorance not knowing well how to cypher or cast account shall happen to read mr ass or dr dunce or blind divine the affecter of those trifling titles of mr of arts doctor in divinity batchelour in divinity who is not more baccalaureus then laurus sine baccis shall in no wise be laughed at and as little lamented at all by me

and since am thus casually fallen upon this theam about respect to mens persons and using titles of honour to them its not much amiss minding gods matters more then mens manners and more then that our masters of art call method before proceed in examination of t.d's false charge of me as to matter of popery left find no fitter place for it in the after part of this book to take notice here of another inordinate charge of t.d in which it concerning all the qua my self also am not a little concern'd which in
of his first pamph upon occasion of r.h his calling thomas rumsey by his own name is on this wise
you qua are an unmannerly generation you might have given a magistrate the title of master
rep how contrary are these teachers ministers alias servants of our times who with the rest of their fellow rabbies painted sepulchres whited walls cleansers scribes pharisees hypocrites blind guides strainers at gnats and swallowers of camels love uppermost rooms at feasts chief seats in synagogues greetings in markets and affect to have men called and to be called of men rabbi rabbi master master reverend sir and such like to the only one master christ who condemns all this and cryes wo against those that are found in it mat
otum

how contrary are they to his apostles who forbade this respect to

mens persons which these master ministers are ever and anon pleading for against the qua as a clownish unmannerly generation for not giving it iames sayes iames to
my brethren have not the faith of our lord iesus with respect of persons telling the saints that if they have respect to rich men that wear gold rings and goodly apparrell and set them up on high and despise the poor in vile rayment setting them at their heels and putting them under feet as the footstool they are partial within themselves commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors elihu when he was to speak for god to iob and his great friends sayd job
let me not accept any mans person neither let me give unto man for know not to give titles in so doing my maker would soon take me away and so goes on using no other titles to him beside his name and that plain but now disdained thee and as his words are most truly and properly translated out of the into right english thus did the saints and ministers of god of old even like to christ himself of whom twas said by the pharisees mat
that took notice of it and perhaps disgusted it as much as our modern ministers now do some of which though they say little yet think the more master we know thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou not the person of men even caesars meer person more then anothers yet he gave caesar his due too and though he was free gave him tribute mat
and so did his saints then and we now give tribute to whom tribute custom to whom custom honour to whom honour fear to whom fear obedience to obedience is due and with that honour of yielding tribute and subjection to as we have the due benefit of protection by their laws while just and enacted according to the law and light of christ in every conscience which is holy just and good and while as justly executed by rulers do we honour them yet then only are their laws justly enacted and executed nevertheless when these outward swordbearers and their laws are a terror to evil works and a praise encouragement to the good and to them that do well for else they act more might then right and as the devil does who is the prince of the power of the air the god of this world and ruler of the darkness of it undefined span alphabet according to meer will and lust not according to law itself by permission for a time but not by any true commission from god himself by whom the law which we own in its place was added because of transgression and is not for the righteous but for the unrighteous for murderers theeves and whatever is contrary to sound doctrine and godliness

and this truly divine honour of subjection and obedience to magistrates just laws as justly executed as enacted is it and not the meer humane of high flattering titles as you and sir and complements and cringings and outward worships and and bodily bowings to mens persons which in the second commandment by whom ever used as in the typical time they were by iacob to esau himself by david and others whose practice is not our rule but gods praecept are prohibited to be given to the image or likeness of any thing in heaven

earth or under the earth is that god cals for and we give for conscience sake

and thus we honour all men owing nothing to any but love which works no ill to the neighbour and fulfils the law and so children are bid by paul to obey their parents as tis fit in the lord in which obedience though they make not idols of them kneel not down and ask them blessing as in popish days they foolishly did to their godfathers and godmothers when they meet them they are said according to that commandment to honour the father and the mother ehh
and so servants in their relation honour their own masters when not with as but in singleness of heart as fearing god the great master in heaven they are faithful in the business they are entrusted with by them though they never stand cap in hand to them and should never call them by that name of master which yet we allow as the scripture it self does as well that of father mother king ruler magistrate when used not as a flattering title but as a note or term of distinction between the relatum and the correlatum in that relation that is between princes and subjects parents and children masters and the servants that have hired themselves to them and thus only ought things among the saints
howbeit such a generation of parasites are all sorts of professors now become that without exception of any but the qua who come to that beginning which is also the end of all things and is now at hand they all more or less have mens persons in admiration because of advantage and are found sluttering and falling down at the feet of the great lords of the earth little less then adoring the earthly tabernacles of those that can climb highest in authority and painting and trimming them out as the rest of the birds did the naked in the fable with every one a new fine feather till every one plucking away his own again as anon they do they leave their lords who knew not their old friends nor themselves neither while their honour lasted which is plus in honorante ever then in honorato and stands more in his fickle will that gives then his that hath the honour as naked laughing stocks in the midst of their and in more fulness of shame and confusion of face then could have befell them possibly had they never been so preheminently exalted

yea so odious are the cronchings of christians to each other according as they are higher or lower in their gentile preferments and gentilelike lordliness that they contrary to christ who said to his disciples mat
it shall not be so among you exercise or'e one another and that not only in italy france and spain but even in these so ever and anon besworn not to say forsworn nations that are ever reforming and yet deformed that it loads and loaths the life of god in his saints while in the light it looks upon those antick adorations that pass between man and man christian and christian brother and brother in the same church when one clambers but a little higher then another in places of earthly command not only in such words as may it please your highness your excellency my lord but also such gestures and postures of

standing re and putting off and bending to the very soles of one anothers feet in token of respect and that sometimes when in heart they could with each other hang'd and holding up one anothers traines cum multis aliis quae nauc as if they would do honour to the shadow of one anothers and tie themselves eternally to attend upon the very tayles one of another for the lease of such perishing pieces of outward honour as are entail'd as they dream on such and such places as persons can procure them for no less then from henceforth world without end amen

besides oh the shamefully titles that are now entaild as badges of honour by men one to another from generation to generation as may it please your holiness which is that flattering title blasphemously and prophanely attributed to his wickedness the pope your majesty your highness your grace your eminency your excellency your honour your worship honoured sir reverend sir worthy sir segnior mounsieur master which are respectively attributed to emperors kings princes dukes generalls marquesses earls vizcounts barons baronets knights esq iudges serjeants doctors at law councellers governours and commanders civil and millitary cardinalls mountseniors bishops abbots arch deacons deanes and their officialls doctors batchelors in divinity and other sciences masters and batchelors of arts and such academicall admirers of mens persons for advantage rectors parsons vicars curates and other such spirituall persons and clericall classicall and conventionall creatures and all these little less abominaably and prophanely then that of holiness to the pope forasmuch as the men call'd christians who now give and take all these do to their own further confusion make confession to god himself through their priests lips and ministers mouths in their daily prayers that all honour glory praise power blessing dignity dominion worship worth reverence thanksgiving and obedience belongs to god alone and do to him only but that they mock him while they pray seem to ascribe it all and if all belong to him only then none to man whose breath is in his nostrills who is to be ceased from and not at all to be accounted on at least while he beares as in the fall he does no other then the dishonourable image of satan and till he come back by the light into that image and glory of god which now by sin saving the few that are regenerated from that degeneracy mankind universally comes short of which image power and glory of god alone in man which image is christ jesus the righteousness and wisdom of god the express image of the father we respect reverence and honour where even it appears let the person in which be elsewise never so mean among mistaken men so daily honouring all men in the lord as enjoyned by him pet

and as he does that dwells in gods holy hill in whose eyes as its said psal
a vile person is contemned not estimated or counted on the more for his outward greatness but he honours them that fear the lord whom men in the fall that regard wordly goods and earthly greatness more then reall and heavenly goodness for the most part are found despising

and further yet so gros is the greediness after this destruction of the

faith of god by the respect to mens persons in this english nation that for the sake thereof they are as few or no nations besides them are become more ignorant in one thing then the poor unlearn'd qua as they call them are in their own mother tongue for as little as the qua do ultra linguam vernaculam sapers and as little la ine as they understand as sayes in his latine labours against them yet they both ken and keep to the proper idiom of the english language in using that of thee and thou when they speak to what ever single person without respect but our seed or canaanitish ashdodites speak half one way and half another often and their inferiors but so of offending great mecenasses and men of place and power in eodem cum illis harent they by the plurall you as if they were talking to more while they are bespeaking no more then one an absurd abuse of their native nationall tongue

in hebrew greek and latine there is not such a gross perverting of the pronoune of the person plurall as slavish feare and flattery and fawning and pride and men pleasing and ambition and affectation of the honour from beneath respect to the persons of men and having them in admiration because of advantage such like dirt filth as is tit for nought but the dunghil from whence it came hath brought into our english nation where the filth aforesaid hath blinded and besotted the foolish folk thereof so far that it hath in a manner forced them universally to forget and forsake that forme of speech that is most proper to the english tongue and utterly to loose their own native language the right use of the aforesaid pronoune so as to wrest it besides its own due true speciall prime and genuine signification into a sense that is in truth no less then false silly non sensicall
for in hebrew undefined span alphabet attah undefined span alphabet if it be the faeminine not only signifies thou or thee as likewise undefined span alphabet attem and atten in the plurall you and yee but also the iewish nation in their writings and talkings one to another as they ever did so do at this day usually keep thereunto saying continually when they speak to a single per on only though never so great as well as when to the meanest attah or at if to a woman that is being englished thou or thee but never attem or atten that is being englished you or yee but when they speak to more then one the truth whereof as some of them call'd qua have been eare witnesses who have been in discourse with many of those thousands of the iews they have been amongst so all that know ought of the hebrew tongue may be eye witness thereof if they will but peruse the scriptures or any other writings in that language
also in greek undefined span alphabet su sou soi se which are the same pronoune of the person singular varied only as to the case signifying thou or thee are universally used among the gracians both in orall discourses and writings when a single person only is spoken to and the words in the plurall undefined span alphabet humeu humon humin humas which in english are you or yee us'd only when more then one are spoken to

also in latine every one that is learn'd no farther then the accidence hath learnt so much that tu tui tibi te which are thou or thee in the

singular number only us'd and never vos vestrium vobis which in sence and signification are you and yee when a single person only is written or spoken to and it would be counted false latine and ridiculous and such a thing as deserves hissing at among very to use the terms vos or vobis to express one single person by

and yet such is the folly and apishness of our english nation that when they speak to one person only specially if it be a superiour for when they speak to inferiours they often times keep to thee and thou and thy or thine which is the pronoune possessive derived from its primitive thou thou shalt have this or that will give this or that to thee get thee hence go thy why this book is thine and such like but when a superiour say is spoken to as a matter a father a a knight a gentleman as they call them a magistrate a governour or some great then out of that reverentiall respect they have to mens persons which cannot stand with the true faith of god and without transgression of the law iam
they use the words you yee and your and yours which in the propriety of the english speech are only for the plurall number and to be used only when more persons then one are spoken to which gross digression and degeneration from the truth of their own mother tongue in saying you sir may it please you your worship your excellency or the like is as abominably absurd as it would be if in any of the three languages abovesaid men should use words of the plurall number to a particular person and the absolute absurdity of that every a only in any of those tongues is able to discover and would abandon yea to say in english you sir to one man be he never so eminent is as false english as its false latine to say to one in latine vos domine that's as false as to these words thou lovest by the latine words vos amas which is no better then nos or ego amanus or tu or amant and all this the very accidence doth cry shame on finally as the hebrew greek and latine testaments as well as all other writings in those several languages do so clearly witness it besides what evidence comes into this matter from other tongues viz italian dutch spanish that as we may safely summon all men to shew us so much as one instance where any of the words of the plurall number are ever used to a verbe of the second person singular or us'd to express one single individuall person so as to say in hebrew undefined span alphabet abavia attem or in greek undefined span alphabet or in latine vos amas which are all being englished thou levest so excepting the writings of modern men only or their modern translations of other ancient humane writings which all makes nothing against us in this case so rightly properly and truly both have and still daily do our very adversaries fall in with us and favour us whether they will or no in this point in the translation of all our english bible which for shame they will not say but they have translated into the most proper and not improper english that we can challenge all english men in the world to shew us any one translation or any place in any one translation of the bible out of hebrew greek or latine into the english tongue wherein the word you which is now so used in their common discourses one to another but especially when proud personages are bespoken or

any other terme then that of thou or thee is used to speak to a single person by as well when god himself or the greatest king or proudest prince as when the poorest peasant or simplest servant is spoken to and we will yeeld further to them that stomack it to be thee'd and thou'd by us then yet we can or if they will help themselves by such a helpless shift as to say the bibles are not translated so properly and truly as they should be as to those words of thou or thee let such as snuff at thou and thee from us put out the words thou and thee and instead thereof put in the words you or yee when god and great men are spoken to so as where its said to god thou lord madest the heavens and they are the work of thine hands all thy workes praise thee and thy saints bless thee to read thus viz you god made the heavens they are the works of your hands all your works praise you and your saints bless you and in that place where paul saith to agrippa dost thou beleive king agrippa yea know thou beleivest to read dost ye beleive king agrippa yea know you beleivest and they will see what a palpable piece of nonsence it would amount to like to which yet they utter and sound forth in their ordinary locution but feel it not and last of all if thou and thee be not to be used to a single person only it hath no place nor use at all in the for it can't possibly be properly used when we speak to more it being saving when we speak to them as a collective body and as one and so somtimes the prophets spake to whole nations under the term of thou and thee no less unsound and unsavory to say thou or thee to men as you or ye to one and alike foolish to say to two severall men thou shale both dye ile kill thee both as to say to one of them only you alone shall dye will kill you which are two bulls that deserve both to be soundly baited

to conclude this then we see how our chief priests scribes pharisees and hypocrites of these dayes as they did of old love the praise of men more then the praise of god have that faith they have in god with respect to the persons of men which who so has is a sinner and transgressor of the law and though their mouths speak great swelling words of faith religion reformation god christ church ministry yet they are but walkers after their own lusts and sensuall or meer animall as iude sayes verse
not having the spirit while they have mens persons in admiration because of advantage and beleive not though they deem themselves every one in his own form to be the true beleivers so long as they are thus busied in begging and buying giving and taking this honour that is from beneath only for not seeking the honour that is only from aboue which all the saints have psal
them say what they will yee sayes christ ioh
how can ye beleive which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that commeth from god only as unmannerly a generation then as t.d faith the qua are in not using that flattering title of mr to rumsey the magistrate say if rs carriage were more like a magistrates then tis according to the proverb tis better of the two if that were unmannerliness to be a little unmannerly then so much troublesome as men in the fall are one to another with their tedious attendances antick adoratious of each other and supersluous complements

indeed good manners to use it by none but that people whose evill communications corrupt good manners the heathen whose customes are vain and as for us if any man list to be contentious about our manners in such matters he must know that as there's no law of god or man that hinds us from keeping on our hats from thee or thou to cap and congee and you sir and master and such like flatteries not to say meer fooleries which are all in the fall so we have no such manner of manners nor customes among us nor any of the true churches of god
and hereby we appeare to any save such as will needs mistake us to be neither papists nor popish priests for they have as much of that kind of ill manners of honouring each others persons as is to be found among your selves nevertheless who so blind as he that will not see thou wilt needs so befool thy self as to make it that am one of them whose words excepting as in the proviso abovesaid now verbatim to be rehearsed who having hinted it in
how rob
wilkinson minister of staple had accused me to have been at rome and received a pension from the pope goest on as followes

as to the matter whereof samuel fisher was accused part of it he denied not namely that he hath been at rome but that he received a pension from the pope he utterly denied which yet that is probably as true for have it from very good hands that in his late travail to constantinople and thence to rome he had as good bills of exchange as most gentlemen that travaile and yet tis well known that he hath no visible estate
and the qua who came to hear the dispute who suppose would not bely him did report that he did bear his witness against the pope and cardinals at rome and yet suffer'd them not to meddle with him which how unprobable it is let all men judge but how much more probable that the true cause of his safety was his compliance with them the doctrines which he broaches among us and as he saies in all other places being theirs and a fair inlet to their bag and baggage
and to assure the reader of the likelihood of his compliance with the antichristian faction

thou maist please to know that the instant english account two honest and credible men of sandwich had some discourse with fisher at dunkirk and he told them that he looked upon the jesuits and friars there to be founder in doctrine then those we call the reformed churches
this they are ready to testifie at any time upon call

another passage have to acquaint thee with viz that the aforesaid fisher in conference with the sandwich men at dunkirk may
english stile did affirm that he himself is above ordinances and that there is no more use of them in this life to many portions then there is of a candlelight when the sun shines and he gave instance in the uselessness of baptism and the lords supper
and the same witnesses were credibly informed at dunkirk that fisher hath great bills of exchange from a quaking london merchant and may take up four hundred pound if he will

and hundreds of people can testifie how light he made of the charge of pope on the first day of the dispute when pluck'd amesus tome against

bellarmine and offer'd to read part of it out of the latine into english and with a gesture of derision he replied that bellarmine held many truths which must not be rejected because he held them and he gave for instance that christ is the son of god

moreover in
thou writest thus viz the third question debated on was though with much ado at length stated in these termes wheth
our good works are the meritorious cause of our justification and held it in the affirmative
prove it to these words now you shew your self a rank papist indeed
rep monstrum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum what a horrible bundle of blindness is here what a hidden heap of hocus this nasty piece of naative is of itself a little lake of lyes and the whole is little better under this hedg are many hidden many cockatrices hatched up whose fruit is as a fiery serpent many false tongues fed with fuell fit for them many fools fenced in their folly as with a thicket of thornes many sons of beli bolstred up in their blasphemies and emboldened to throw about in their madness firebrands arrows death among these nettles of thy planting t.d do the seed of the serpent the generation of vipers breed make their nests nourish up one another and so securely shelter themselves under the shadow thereof that like adders and scorpions they sting cum privilegio with their tongues and with their tayles not only shooting out misreports from their mouths but leaving behind them where ere they come the fiery darts of their lying tales the deadly poyson of which sets on fire the course of nature in virulent spirits and whole housholds on fire of hell against the truth in which work but that truth is strong enough to stop as well the lyars as the lyons mouths these creatures of thy creating could not quickly be controul'd having now the authority of thy printed undefined span alphabet to shew for their abomination and to back them in it which undefined span alphabet like some benefactor to their lying lips thou hast as a certaine legend of lyes bestow'd upon them

its but meet therefore and more then time that some reply be from me return'd to these and other particulars of thy legend for truths sake though else so far as my person alone and abstract from that is interessed therein should god knows in whom am hid as in from the strife of tongues please my self much more to sit down in silence as have hitherto done under many other mens misreports of another nature under the tumultuousness of the wicked who are like troubled raging waves of the sea never at rest but ever casting up mire and dirt and foaming out against me their own shame and thine also whilst stirred up therto by the stormy wind of that malevolent spirit which from this and severall other quarters of thy book breaths out and blowes upon them yea did not see the truth though vindicated against thee to the full by my foresaid friends suffering among some where their writings have not come for want of somewhat from my self should assuredly sit still drinking in contentedly every dram of thy drassy discourse under this thy tempestuous showre whilst it shatters it self down from thy black

inky pen in such dirty droppings upon my head or at most saying as one dribling disputant used to say no more then quid tum to all that's true and negatur id to all that's false which though it be but a ridiculous reply yet would rout it all were an answer answerable enough to thy ridiculous reports for that of thine that's true hath nothing in it so much as probably to prove what thou inferr'st from it that which is false in itself as to the thing asserted is fit for nothing but to be denyed for from it much less can there either probably or possibly be inferred any truth for wheras they say of propositions and premises according as they regularly legitimately or irregularly are disposed as to the outward forme thereof thus viz ex falsis falsum verum sequetur ex veris possit nisi vera sequi so inverting the order say of prepositions or premises according as they are true or false in their subject matter
ex veris verum falsum sequetur exfalsis nil nisi falsa sequi

now therefore that honest well meaning men and simple hearted people may be no more guld and misguided by thy guilded glosses in these particulars as many have been as well in these particulars concerning my single self as in those aforesaid concerning both me the qua in generall and that the mouth of the horse and mule placere magistro utuntur diligentia nec sunt tanti cessatores ut calcaribus indigeant which are forward enough and to fall on and open in lyes do not need thy spur may be held in from any more harming as with bit and bridle in the name of the lord though he that removeth the stones and breaketh the hedg serpents lodg may look not only to be hissed at for his paines but also to be hurt and bitten therewith shall bring down this slight wall which thou hast built and other diviners of lyes dawb with their untempered morter glorying therein as in some strong tower though it is but rudis indigesta{que moles a rock of meer rubbish and no more then a refuge of lyes that the foundation thereof may be discovered not bawlking for the bawlings barkings and brabbles of any owners thereof shall break in upon this bushy brake of briars and brambles and lay the axe to the root of it which is no better than rottenesse it self that its blossom may go up as the dust but confesse were not guided by a manifestation of that spirit of god of which thou lyingly sayest ver
and had little of for twas by a plentiful measure of that spirit of god which blasphemously thou callest a spirit of errour and contradiction by which they so hampered thee that thou wast able with all thy to resist it no otherwise their those who resisted the same in steven acts
and not by that mother wit to which thou a cribest it should have been much to seek how to behave my self in the handling of these thy unhearn businesses mean thy two narratives of which this parcel about the qua being probably papists and my self probably a iesuit is a most passage yea so over grown are they with lying words and all manner of evill weeds that as the bungling barber for want of skill never left handling the deformed beard of a new customer of which he should have left some standing till he had handled it all away so should hardly have found any thing at all

in them thats worth sparing the very truths that are therein being told to as bad an end as the very lyes but wisdom is profitable to direct in that measure of which that who am else very fool have received from above and from him alone out of whose mouth it cometh to all them and them only who wait for it thereat reject no more then that which is refuse and deal with these thy two excrementitious matters as men do with the most unprofitable and useless hair of hogs and swine when they have to do with it viz make use of so many of the best bristles as will fit their own use and singe the rest in the fire or else sweep it all away into the sink for that little of thy superfluous stories which must be granted for true and serviceable serves not thee who re latest it so well against me as it serves me against whom thou relatest it against thy self

in disproof then of the truth of thy or accusation of me to be a rank papist a complyer with the pope and cardinals and one that receive a pension from him which is the of thy brittle building that am to take down and the conclusion in proof of the probability whereof at least all the rest is alledged shall not as much countryfied as am be so dunsical as to begin with the denial of the conclusion nor would my nay prevail against thy yea among thy creditors if should but discover first the falseness weakness nakedness and inconsequences of the premises that every indifferent reader may conclude the utter improbability of the truth of thy confident conclusion within himself and remove the under stones which thou lay'st for thy foundation and among the rest that of my holding some doctrines held at rome which thou makest the very head of the corner that so the topstone may tumble down of it self
what is true among thy premises shall own the truth of but deny the consequence thereof as to that which by thee is from thence deduced and what is false not only deny but also deny the consequence of it if it were true


that have been at rome and there born my testimony against the pope and cardinals in such wise was required of me by the lord who sent me who only and not my self as thou quippingly recitest that passage suffer'd them not to meddle with me that made light of thy charging me with popery and that was at dunkirk and in discourse with the two men of sandwich foxton and barber at the time thou speakest of and that somewhat by me was spoken about friars and iesuits holding some sound doctrines which some protestant priests deny and somewhat about the or indifferency of the use of the things ye call ordinances where the substance of which they were shadows and to which as figures they pointed was come in place like as of a candle where the sun shines and that said good works intending christs are the meritorious cause of our iustification and argued a contrariis to this effect viz
evil works are the meritorious cause of our condemnation therefore good works are the meritorious cause of our or iustification all these premises are own'd and thy elf also asserting thus far only of me artown'd as standering me of no

more then truth but quid hoc ad all this yet is of no consequence as to thy deduction

and
as to all the rest viz my having bils of exchange to and from constantinople to rome and my broaching doctrines that are not only theirs but a fair inlet to their bag and baggage and my saying to and at dunkirk in those very terms thou settest down that looked upon the iesuits and friars there to be sounder in doctrine then those ye call the reformed churches and that my self am above ordinances and that have great bils of exchange from a quaking londonmerchant as thou quippest it out again and that the terms of the third question which held in the affirmative were whether our good works viz done by us only and not by christ in us are the meritorious cause of our iustification and that undertook to prove it under terms of our good works in thy sense its all as false to the full as the other is but if it were every whit as true as it is utterly false yet would not thy conclusion viz that have a pension or am in pay from the pope follow from it so much as probably as thou dotest much less so necessarily as throw their dotage upon thy disputings many ignorant ones of thy instructing do as ordinarily as ignorantly infer it the falsehood of that which is false and the inconsequence of both that which is true and that which is false and the utter invalidity of what is false in case it were never so true to prove thy charge against me of complying with or having pay from the pope shall yet a little more particularly explain


then that have been at rome and that in a double sense is true enough first spiritually and mystically when was but a protestant at large and so born and bred as english people for the most part still are then dwelt together with them and you national ministers and in the suburbs and of that great city rome or mystery babylon the great the papacy the and mother of her daughters the two younger harlots prelacy and presbyterie that are both separated from her bowels and as like her in many matters viz persecution for conscience sucking saints blood greediness of gain lording it by a lordly clergy over the true clergy or heritage of god of the popes first imposing posture of his constituting traditional and sundry other romish remnants and relicks of romes religion yet abiding unabandoned and pleaded for as one kind of christ'n creatures that are unlike to christ himself can be to each other and as a pair of young sisters facies non omnibus una est nec diversa tamen can well look like so old and a mother in the said suburbs and of which said great city which once was in one room but before its ruin stands divided into three p.p parts canina utentes facundia barking and together by the ears with one another and like some old bawd and her two and breaking each other to pieces about their bastardy ye dwell to this day not only being in the same inward but in somethings also in the same outward form and image while ye hold your pontifical orders by vertue of which you so pope it in your parishes from

such presbyters as had theirs from the prelate who had theirs from the who had theirs from the pope by lineal succession who had his as the great whore hath rev

from the beast that bears her who rev
had his from the devil or dragon who whether he had his power seat and great authority from peter or no credat apella


that have been bodily in rome literally so cal'd

as did not so do not deny and that as its evident by what of mine is extant against the c.c clergy have done here so bore my witness against the pope and cardinals there in such as was cal'd to do might make manifest here were so minded but need not as though wehercock thou upon it go'st about to deny and disprove it again as unprobable yet thou seemest first both to believe and prove it to be probable thy self for thou saist the qua did report it of me and thou supposest they would not bely me and that am since in safety from their hands thy self hast seen thou canst believe thine own eyes but what of all this doth all or any of this minister to you ministers who make so much of it that way any just matter of crime whereupon to accuse me at all or any matter of probable proof of so high a crime as ye and your people are ever charging me with of complying with and of being in orders and pay from the pope

among many hundreds of iews the truth hath been testified to openly in their synagogues and streets of their cities in rome and and yet being in safety from them hath been witnessed the truth hath been testified in turkie yea by the power of god to some great bashaws and to the very grand himself and his councell by some of the servants and of the lord on whom in these dayes he pours out of his spirit who by the same power of god have with such usage as will shame england old and new especially if it look not to it in time been dismissed peaceably from their presence doth this prove the qua complyance in their several superstitions with either the iews or turks respectively trow not yet heu quam facile est invenire baculum ad caedendum canem when men have once an ill name as the proverb is they are half hang'd so that evil shall be ever charged upon them for doing good when for being christ friends they become enemies to the world who hates him and for his sake are hated as a dog how easie is it for the worlds own children not only to find a quarrel against them but a cudgel also to beat them at their pleasure for mark how matter of accusation it self is made by our priests of our having been at rome and declaring there against popery and under that protection we went out in returning safe again into england which is now laid to me as a crime witness thy words viz t.d
as to the matter of which s.f was accused part of it he denied not namely tha he had been at rome

rep
had been executed there as might have been if the lord had not kept me it had satisfied some parish preachers and others here very well who though they seemed to congratulate my well coming home yet were more merry when they heard was hang'd or hew'd to pieces

but now am as well as some smooth tongues seem to wish me tis hardly well with them while its well with me so that if they had advantage would not be slack to make use thereof to have execution against me here so that may safely say lord where should the witnesses of thy truth be safe or have a quiet being if not in thee who when they go into other nations are in danger to lose their lives as hereticks and and when they return if the malice of their own counmen might be permitted to prevail are in perils of being hang'd nearer home as or such as are in pay and orders from the pope while twas both heard and hoped were never likely to come safe back again from out of the paw of that romish lyon twas counted no crime by the clergy even at rome it self to bear testimony against it but sith its seen had no harm there it must be thence granted that did some and that a mans being there only is crime enough to be on and not only so but some eminent evidence of such another high crime as by the law as it yet stands were it made good against me cals for no less then handling with an english halter so in summe say some of our english seminaries whose voice is smooth as iacobs but their hands ever rough as the hands of esau


but be it as high a crime as it will for such as here protest against the pope to visit rome can do so much good at least against their evil as to excuse my cheif accusers and as candidly to clear our clergy of it as several of them continually are charging me therewith yea am perswaded that our english clergy are as clear in their consciences from the guilt of that crime and as fearful of that fault and as free from the thoughts of committing such a thing as travelling to rome to tell the truth as they are far from it in their persons while they are preaching against it in their parishes and as they are far from consenting to it and calling for it that the iews may come into england in order to their coming to the truth for whose coming to it they are always calling upon god
there is little posting to preach abroad by these fixed stars the stand stiff like posts in their own places let those wandring stars say they not considering that the vagabonds and wandring stars to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever are such as wander with cain from the light of god and not to and fro to preach the gospel let the qua gad about and gang to rome or where they will wee'l be none of their gang and as for money there's little need for them to run so far as rome for pay to receive his pensions from the pope himself having it nearer home
it is enough for our parochial priesthood to receive the romish pay of parsonages vicaradges curateships tithes add other of romes bonifaces benefices and benedictus's blessings in their native nation and have the popes pensions and their part of peters patrimony for preaching against the pope and peter too in the popes old mouldy to his own parochially moulded churches

its enough for them to abide here praying down antichrist and praying home the iews and preaching against the qua while they go out against him as siders with and upholders of him as much as against

antichrist himself and cry out against those that go out as the lord moves to cry in the iews as one with the for so saith the qua are in enmity to the scripture and as then the very iews themselves

lord god forgive cease this bessech thee by whom shall iacob arise for he is yet small by whom shall the romane antichrist fall for he is yet great when such as call themselves thy messengers will neither go on thy errand or message themselves nor quietly suffer messengers of thine that are made willing to it by thy power but are out to thee to bring down antichrist and bring in the iews and yet crying out against those that go out as from thee to bring in the one and bring down the other but by this time suppose that as the true israel and clergy that is of god do little less then abhorre to see it so some of their own folds do smile more then they'l seem to do to hear their clergy calling and sounding out to god in their sundry synagogues lord discover the skirts of that scarlet whore of rome and yet not renouncing but reverencing the reliks and doing homage to the very hem of it to this day and hating those as her friends and their enemies that seek to rent it all along as far as from rome it self to the very scarlet rags and remnants thereof that are yet remaining in their own nation and universities
gather in thy ancient people the iews and yet neither going out to gather the iews nor giving way to the iews when they would to gather so much as into england that they might be gathered to the lord let thy gospel run and be glorified when yet it may run far enough before these lovers to sleep in a whole skin are free to follow in the service of it any further then they can serve their own interest by it and make more gain of it to themselves

though then such as viam vel invenient vel facient flectere fi nequeunt superos acheronta movebunt
if they cannot fairly find it as from god will rather rake and skim the devil as the proverb is then want wherewith to accuse the servants of the lord do make it a matter of accusation for them to have been at rome and matter of argumentation to that greater evil of complying with and receiving pension from the pope to bear any witness safely against him there yet is there no just ground whereon to make either a matter of fault of the one or a matter of faith of the other and howbeit that faithless generation of men cal'd ministers who fear to follow christ any further then he feeds them aforehand with full assurance of life and outward livelihood believe it well nigh at least improbable to come safe from rome without complying with the antichristian faction and my self who know more then they of this will yield thus much to them that to such as consult with flesh and blood in themselves or in fleshly friends whose councel had we heeded when we were more then half way towards rome we had certainly either not gone thither or not return'd without that complyance its not a little unlikely whereupon we were all the way deliver'd up unto death within ourselves and by our selves counted as sheep for the slaughter that

were marching into the very month of the lyon yet so far is this from being of force to infer what thou in thy fleshly fancy fetcheft from it viz a probability of our complyance with that popish faction that to a true spiritual understanding an evident argument it is rather of a more then ordinary hand of providence held over us and of another kind of presence protection and powers being with and upon us in our obedience to god who sent us in that service to whose name only and not at all to us for ever be the glory of it then that which you witness in your and easie exercise sith in his name spirit light power dread and fear we not only undertook but were kept safe'in the undertaking of that which your selves neither dare nor can believe ye can likely do without your own ruin and destruction and some of this declared openly at the dispute to thee and all the rest and much more would have declared in satisfaction to that auditory when the foresaid accusation was under consideration but that to the shame of your small patience in a thing that so neerly concern'd thy self and them ye utterly refus'd to hear me clear my self and the truth to the full in that particular which had ye heard me out in ye had hindered that your hasty stumbling at me whereby ye also are fallen into your printed folly which is now making manifest to all men but now ye have judg'd neither rightly because rashly without hearing all that was to be heard on either side nor yet the right thing but a very lye for am no sidesman with the papists and if were yet you judging me after you had refused to to hear me are unjust nevertheless in so doing for

qui statuit aliquid parte inaudita altera aequum licet statuerit fuerit

but alas as thou sayst
not more proverbially then improperly of
must say properly of thee and thine who so bold as blind byard in a land of uprightness ye will judge and deal unjustly and will not behold the majesty of the lord when the hand of the lord is lifted up ye will not see but ye shall see and be ashamed of your envy at his people the fire of your own envy shall devour you but thou lord wilt ordain peace for us for thou also hast wrought all our works in us isa
glory glory be to thy holy name therefore for ever
thus far as to the inconsequence of one of d's
arguments to prove me to be a pensioner to the pope and a complyer with him and his cardinalls at rome the antecedent of which viz that first was at rome secondly bare my witnesse against them there thirdly came away safe is not onely true but trebble yet not strong enough to draw on his heavy lead'n conclusion
but being loath to venture the whole stresse of his cause upon so slender a trebble string as that hath many more strings yet to his bow with all which notwithstanding he shoots too short to hit the mark though if that will do him any advantage shall strengthen his weak and brittle fidling strings as well as can by twisting two or three more of them together

next then shall try what can be made of these concurrences

viz first my having no vissible estate secondly my having as good bills of exchange as most gentlemen as he calls them though call all men so that are so gentle as not to backbite and no more so save such as will not that travail in my late travail to constantinople and from thence to rome
thirdly my now having great bills of exchange from a quaking london merchant so that may take up if will

that this triune antecedent may be of the more credible uncontroleaable and unconquerable force to draw men into a beleef of the conclusion there is not bare ipse only for it each thread of it is backt ore again from breaking by the credibility of the testimony that attends it the first quote he is well known as if it needed no proof being of it self obvious to all men the second he hath from very good hands the third the two credible men of sandwich who yet have crackt their credit so with me that shall hardly heed them again in hast were credibly informed of it as this looks like some threefold cord that is not easie to be broken yet for all this all this will be found but as toe towards t.d.'s business for to say the truth its but a meer trinity of tales and not of truths

whether it be better or worse the more honour or the more shame for me that so have it best concerns my self to examine for as it was best of all with him who while the foxes had holes and fowls of the aire nests had not where to lay his head so t'was well enough with them that had and may be with such as now have if they find their call is so to leave all and follow christ neither scrip nor nor mony in their purses and no more then the cloaths to their backs for they lacked nothing yet so it is and well known to my selfe and some as well known as tis to t.d and his earewigs that have none that though my estate lyes much more in invisibles then in visibles have some visible estate and that to the full as much for my self and mine as either need or much desire and how beit have not perhaps so much as t.d nor as i.o who besides that rich possession he counts upon in his hebrew punctation of which more anon had lately but now hear he is turned out of it a deanry of many hundreds per annum yet est mihi far modicum purum et sine labe salinum humilique loco sed certa cedet sordida parvae fortunae domus

and that have no more then have it is under god at my own choice having long since for a good conscience sake laid down twice more then that which comes in to thee t.d by preaching and refufed the profer of much more since both of that and of another nature and if had none at all need not run to rome having were so mindfull of such outward estate as came out of an opportunity still to return and being if could make shipwrack of the faith for it as many do were as much given to climbing clambering as most of you are as capable to receive in england either that popish pay and preferment ye still stand in and freely fell from as ye yet are or as my self ever have been in dayes of old or that of another sort that is in no wise of the pope which yet trust shall chuse pulse and water

rather then forgo the truth as some do to partake in

secondly how credible it is here asserted by thee for truth as a thing received from yet tis not true that is here related for had no bill of exchange at all with me when went out of england neither had ever any bill of exchange from any place at all to constantinople nor any at all from constantinople to rome and this leave to very good hands from whence thou had it this false report to make it good partly guess what ground this guilty goodly geere grew up from but am not minded at this time to help lyars in their lyes while ee they love them let them help one another and wrestle themselves out from the mists of their own misreporting from the of this piece of if they can no more to do at then to deny it to be truth as its told by them
thirdly how credibly soever the same witnesses whom thou callest honest and credible men were credibly at dunkirk that have yet neither had at nor have had since nor yet have what may have lawfully enough if need be is another case but nothing to thee nor thy ill cause nor to any man but those that as little estate as have being condent of my faithfullness dare trust me so farr any bill of exchange at all by which to up or pence either at my will which faltering of thy so gd honest and credible in each tittle of their testimony that is exhibited to the world in this tripple piece of tittle tartle from which yet thou concludest the things they testifie to be ipso facto well known notifie to the world so much the rather as have done here or else should for my own part have pay'd it with thinking only and let it pass that men may know the better how to beleive thee and them in other things when ye shall happen with lyes to wrong the truth another time

but since have taken on me to take much notice of it let's examine what to the utmost can be made thereof which is just nothing at all towards ds purpose in propounding it in omuch that may truly say of this his treble conference of which his confidence is that its so credible that it gives neither nor more then almost an incredible and inconceiveable influence towards the inference of his most confident and almost as incredible conclusion so that no wise men can yea the most wise men are the they can from ds give credit to it or conceive it or not conceive rather the contrary to be true for as from such matters as are false as said above no thing that is true can be concluded in which respect alone these lyes and lying fables can be of no possible force to inferr my living upon the to be a truth so if they were all as undoubted and certaine truths as tis most certain they are all but or at the best but eports they could none of them at all inferr that but some of them would inferr the very contrary to that which t.d with so much confidence concludeth from them to the deluding of all people that are given over to delusion to beleive lyes to beleive that lye of me that am in pay from the pope as the iews by the like unlikely and silly inference of the souldiers whom the priests

so to argue against it were deluded from believing that truth concerning christ viz that he arose from the dead

oh how wonderfully michievous are misreports unto the truth when men who receive not the love of it that they may be are given over of god to give heed to them that they may be damned because they take pleasure in unrighteousness and have no pleasure in the truth his say they came and stole him away while we slept here is the fictitious and forcible antecedent therefore he arose not from the dead here is the crooked conclusion which that other was so cogent to make the people close with in their consciences and take for truth
piteous premis plain enough to be by men whose eyes were not out to be meerly forged and of little force for if they were awake and on their watch as twas fit for a court of guard to be they might have rescued him from his disciple that were unarmed men but if they were asleep as they say they were is the testimony of those men fit to be entertaind for truth or of force among any but such infatuated fancies as every ignis fatuus befooles into a following of it self wheresoever it goes before them that stand up to beare witness of what was done while they were asleep yet how strongly and strangely did this filly shift work upon the misbeleiving faculty of that foolish nation to the finall falsifying of their faith in so high an article of it insomuch that as that saying is commonly reported so that article of christs resurrection is thereupon not beleived to this day said the evangelists hundred years ago and say who have been an eare witness of the same to this very day wherein we live
the like effectual operation upon the prejudicate opinions and imaginations of such people to whom there is deceptio visus and in whose visible faculty there's a deep defect through their living in the night and not loving the light hath d's and of the qua going to rome which as little or no truth as they are of yet if less then none can be are of less consequence to prove that he intends by them to be truth sith of force to prove the very contrary
quoth he hath no visible estate hath bills of exchange to take up if he will had to and from constantinople to rome bills of exchange to take up money there
therefore tis probably as true that he there receiv'd a pension from the pope

his tripartite antecedent is as false as the popes tripple crown is foolish but suppose it were all as true as tis false know no hurt in it if it were for such as travail whether to rome or elsewhere to have bills to take up money if they need it and what had or where or from whence or from whom let him that lyes go look yet tell the truth to him so farr at least as will tell his tale to be a lye had none to constantinople nor from thence to rome neither received any money by any bill at rome much less any pension from the pope which is that he makes the consequent of the other so that consequence is utterly inconsequent and a most non sequitur
some wise man that had been willing to know the truth would have

argued thus ad contrarium viz
he went with coals from to london therefore tis very probable he went not to london to fetch or to get any there

he carried great bills with him to rome to take up mony there therefore tis utterly unlikely that he had any pension of his own to receive there from the pope for then he might have sav'd his labour in the other
for verily it had been as silly and superfluous for me to have merchants bills to take up mony by at rome had had a pension to receive there from the pope as tis as the proverb is to carry coals to which what fool doth may carry them home again when he hath done
so then this text of t.d's triviall talk as threefold a cord as it may seem to him that is not quickly broken is indeed though strong enough to conclude the clean contrary way yet as to his purpose but a threefold thread of toe so ill spun that it fails like flax when it feels the fire
nevertheless note one point of doctrine more before quit it that arises from it more against then for and his fellow forgers and foul falsifiers of the truth i.e that whereas the national ministry dare trust to the benevolence of their own people for outward means and maintenance no further then they have the magistrates mittimusses to take it from their people and raise it for them for we may have little enough and do full ill cry they if we stand to the good will and affections of our parishes being it seems for all the shallow shews and and fair words that pass between them which buy no lands as little affected by their people as their people are trusted by them for each of them love money much more then they love each other yet such love credit and confidence in each others faithfulness there is among the ministers of truth and the children of it that they that for the gospels sake chuse to have little of their own in their ministry to it need not lack but serving it for its own sake and not for hire nor by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind may not by force of arms but freely not by the greedy distraint of and bumbayliffs but willingly have what is needed which is not so many by the year as the priests that stirring not far from their own fires need it not are ever needing in the service of the truth and rather then it shall want promoting for lack of so much no less then at once if they please

another of t.d's antick autecedents from whence he endeavours as by the rest he doth tooth and nail to evidence me to be of the popish faction is that affirmed my self to be above ordinances saying there's no more use of them in this life to some then of a candle when the sun shines instancing in baptism and the lords supper

rep
in which antecedent this is utterly false at least though affirmed by and his viz that said of my self that am above ordinances use not to bear testimony to my self but to the truth unless where the truth is so much concern'd as it is in my clearing of my self from the clouds that not only but that also comes under through

your lyes that are told and attend me in the service of it in the case in hand neither in the point of perfection which if be but moved to speak the truth in presently cry the blind leaders and the blind whom they lead he faith he is perfect did ever say of my self that am perfect but of myself and that so we should be even in this life and may be too if we be not wanting to our selves and must be also or else shall never be as our heavenly father is perfect and as for my self by the grace of god am what am and what ere am where am you are not though what and where you are both as to this and that to come have been now long ago neither as to ordinances did ever say was above them should not a little bely my self in so and that have little need at all to do being then enough already both by your selves and others for to meet and wait with his saints on the lord to stand in his councel and receive his word from his mouth to learn of christ in silence with all subjection to hear his voice which his sheep only hear though swinish scribes may search the scriptures to enter by him who is the door to bear cu and follow him to pray preach write dispute and do all that am cal'd to in the in the movings of his spirit all and an more that might be nam'd are ordinances of god which am under and yourselves above who are clambering up another way in your own thoughts and understanding above his light in the conscience that is the door which till ye lofty of it the flying fowls of the air the climbers above vouchsafe to stoop and come down to ye shall never enter into the sheepfold finally a holy life and that pare religion that is undefiled before god while all the religion of imture unbridled wantons wordlings stinks before him and is defiled which is to keep a mans self unspotted of the world also to do good works to be zealous of good works to be rich in good works to be reported of for good works to shew our selves paterns of good works to learn to maintain be careful to maintain good works as necessary which because works none of which are good the best of which are all evil further then wrought in christ the light and by christ in us are of none would make of none effect as to our acceptance with god and to walk in the good works which in christ iesus we are we are created unto which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them eph

are ordinance of god which twere well for you all if you were as much under the observance of as ye are under the of which neither did nor do nor dare say am above though as desire never may so by the grace and power of christ to me ward do not live so far below them as thousands do who are both above and below them also too proud of their fine forms to be brought down to the plain power and too much sunk down over head and ears in earth lust luxury love of money pleasure and buried in blindness brutishness and sensuality to be brought up and rais'd into any heavenliness of conversation yet all crying out of them as denyers of gods ordinances that live in the very life and substance of those lifeless images and shadowy parts thereof which they only call so

affirm therefore here before god and all men that never affirmd of my self in these terms in which its here viz that was above ordinances and for thy self t.d and thy two witnesses to it t.f and t.b who are three thomas'es very and hard to believe the truth and for your faithlesness as hardly to be believed whether you will believe me yea or nay as its false that you here so the witness of all three of you against me in this will be of no more force to fright any friends of truth into the faith or belief of what you say then so many leaps of a louse since ye are found deceiving or at best deceived in your other so credible information

and as for the things viz
baptism and the supper which yourselves call ordinances and keep such a quarter for as if they were the main matters which god hath which only can lay true claim to the foresaid title might possibly say then as shall plainly now not in any way of is of god though but as a type and shadow in its time and season that to such as are grown throw those elementary institutions into the life of god which is the end and substances they relate to they may be as to their own particulars as the light of a candle is where the sun shines yet deny not the use of them to such as are not satisfied as to the lord unless they use them but most people either them and themselves in the use of them who neither knowing their right end nor use nor manner of administration do either and alter them into images of their own making both in their subject and their form and thus all rantizers of infants do and all feeders of dogs and swine with that bread and wine which they call the supper for these things are not that washing and supping which were used of old as meer figures and images of the true but sigments and fooleries and images of their own imagining not much as the bodily baptism which baptizeth with but a trashy of man which who so teach for a doctrine or ordinance of god do worship god but in vain not the true outside or shadow of the supper for that is not a coming together into one place which is to decrease and vanish before the internal and which and is to stand nor the external sign of the true cup and table of the lord but in truth the very cup and table of devils where drunkards and swerers lustfulness and all sorts of sinners and walkers beside the light who say they have fellowship with god but lye and have none sit in fellowship with their father the devil

or else secondly dote upon and idolize those graven images of their own which if they were as truly the things in use of old as tis true they are but new inventions of their own yet as the brazen serpent they must be but when once mens hearts go a whoring after them from that which is the end of them all and come not to christ iesus the image and rigteousness of god and to witnesse that wrought and even him who is that image brought forth and formed in them but continue poring upon those rudiments or like one that falls in love with his own image in the water and for love thereof goes down under it and drownes himselfe therein run down so deep into them as to lose themselves from

the other and draw such a thick vaile over their hearts as the iewes so as not to look much lesse enter into the end of the law of which is to be abolished that is of carnall commandments contained in ordinances which are not of the new but of the old covenant which is long since ready to vanish which stood in earings and drinkings and divers baptismes carnall ordinances bodily exercises outward observations in which the kingdome of god stands not which is in righteousnesse peace and joy in the holy spirit so that he who in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god and approved of men
for those meer rites and rudiments of washing eating drinking had their first being beginning rise and institution as circumcision passeover sacrifices and such like had before christ was crucified though in regard of inability to beare the sudden thereof by permission more then commission practised after as circumcision and vowes and shavings and some other rite and ceremonies were in which case if any now will needs them meddle not to forbid

though he that is in the spirit and substance and not the letter of them is not out of them but in them more truly then he that is in them outwardly according to the letter and not in the spirit for they are the iewes the circumcision the christians the baptiz'd ones the suppers with the lord the partakers of his table who open when christ knocks and let him in that he may sup with them and they with him who rejoyce in christ iesus and have no confidence in the flesh and worship god in the spirit and are jewes in heart and spirit not letter onely when they of the letter are but the concision that say they are iewes christians baptists communicants with god children of god but lye and are not but are the synagogue of satan the end of which foresaid outward commandments is love out of a pure heart a good conscience faith unfained which who serve in are the servants of god and who swerve from and turn aside into about the other and are zealous in teaching up the law understand neither themselves nor what they say nor doe nor whereof they affirme and are but of the gentiles that dwell in the outward court which is given to them who tread down the holy citty nor in the inward temple nor of them that worship therein not to be counted thereunto but left out and not measured when the measuring line goeth out upon it to build and rear it up again in the latter dayes

so then though deny all the ordinances traditions and doctrines wayes and worships of men innovated and impos'd at their wills as praecepts of god yet deny not the due use of any thing that ever was in meer outside service required and appointed of god himself when performed in its proper place and season from a right principle of inward power to the right end which they lead and tend to viz christ iesus the head the body of those shadows the image of god begotten and born not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life after which image when men witness themselves to be truly created in righteousness and holiness of truth they will see how these pass away as to the use thereof as the moon in a morning waxes pale and dies out as to its shining any more before the sun as the lesser which must give way to the greater glory which lesser things while men busie themselves in and boast of crying the temple of the lord are these

the tythes offerings the sabbaths the solemn assemblies the sacrifices the circumcision the passeover the baptism the supper the services the ordinances of the lord are these neglecting the weightier matters the washing and circumcising their hearts to the lord the putting off the body of the sins of the flesh putting away the evil of their doings from before gods eyes not minding but forgetting breaking the everlasting visible life way righteousness kingdom house temple gospel glory covenant which the letter lays down as that which all these ceremonies so call'd of undefined span alphabet from their standing but for a time and all these meer temporals do but tend to the lord loaths all that which was even of his own requiring the more men load him with it that love other and says he required it not he spake not of it he would have none of it he could not away with it his delight is not so much in it as in obeying his saul hates it he is weary to bear it tis the offering of swines blood tis the cutting off a dogs neck tis as acceptable to him as if one slew a man tis the blessing of an idol tis but a trusting in lying words when trusted in tis an apron of tis a covering of idols tis a righteousness that shall not profit him tis a refuge of lyes which the hail shall sweep away tis a hiding place which the storm shall overflow by which shall be trodden down even all you that are hidden in it tis a covenant and agreement with death and hell the drunkards of ephraim make which must be disannul'd and not stand tis a bed shorter then that a man can stretch himself on it tis a covering too narrow for a man to wrap himself in it tis a house on the sand and not on the rock of ages the fall of which on the head of the builders will be great when the wind of the lords spirit comes to blow upon it tis flesh that must wither then as the grass and the flower of it tis ashur and jareb that can't cure israels wounds tis pharoah the broken reed that runs into the hand of the leaners thereon tis the egyptians and their horses which are men and flesh not god nor spirit tis the many mountains in which salvation is hoped for in vain tis not the right rest to the soul tis the polluted rest which who ever is in and first or last ariseth not above and departs not out of it will destroy him with a sore destruction tis iniquity tis dung which god will spread upon mens faces who live like swine yet will wallow in it even the dung and iniquity of their solemn meetings

how untrue then thy testimony is of my saying was above ordinances who am one that am under being once baptized as the sprinklers of infants never were if there were any ground of glorying in or any stress to be put upon that and have also used bread and wine till christ who now cometh undefined span alphabet in myriads of his saints came in me as few parish preachers do that prattle for that supper though christ be not yet come in them as he will ere long come nigh to judgement suppose all save such simplerous as either will see or at least seem to see nothing save what their seers see may more easily discern then be ignorant but suppose it were all as true thats here told by you three thomasses would it follow at all from hence that probably comply with the pope and his faction or would it not rather free me among all save such as if they cannot by hooke will needs have it so by crooke from all suspition of such complyance more then such as cry out for ordinances with

the pope yea more for meere mans ordinances too then for gods viz that of sprinkling and ordinances for tribes and maintenance as his priests do is not a far clearer consequence to urge thus viz the parish priestshood of england pleads for ordinances yea for the parliments ordinances the popes ordinances for tribes and other things pertaining to their divine service and their worldly sanctuary as the pope and his priesthood doth therefore they smell so much of popery still that its suspitious they side too much with them still

as for me and the quakers if any but meere partiall and unreasonable minded men who had thought we had utterly denyed ordinances as yee judge we doe would have argued any thing at all from those thoughts of his concerning us he would however minded to bely us in other matters have clear'd us from that censure of popery at least by concluding from t.d's premises the very contrary to what he infers and instead of urging with him he he is above ordinances and denies the use of them therefore can assure the reader of the likelyhood of his complyance with the antichristian saection

would have urged thus viz he saith he is above ordinances denyeth the use of them viz baptisme and the supper therefore may assure the reader that theres little or no likelihood at all of his complyance with the pope and his antichristian faction for they are not above those ordinances but under the use of them

yea adde they are so far under indeed that is below and beneath the true use of gods ordinances that they are not yet as neither are yee got above the traditionary ordinances of man but are all groping together in the dark for the wall like them that have no eyes and tumbling to and fro in that fogg of forefathers figments walking and wandring to wearinesse in that as as superfluous and meere unprofitable usefulnesse of your owne

and as to that other piece of thy scripture which as thou saist
of my urging a proof that was to purpose out of the scriptures of truth of that methinks t.d thou usherest and bringest it in with pomp and ceremony attended with the testimony of hundreds of people as if it would be irresistable and would not onely hit the naile but knock it up in the head io
boys ch nicol focton an esq a minister a magistrate one of a sort set down with an
as representatives of the rest may wave their witnesse if they will in this for freely subscribe to every whit of it as a truth sith its told yet will it not doe at all as to t.d's designe which he there drives on against me but will doe not a little as to my defence

tis true when at the dispute thou offeredst to read something out of amesius against bellarmine replyed as sleighting such a contemptible peice of businesse and since thou wilt so set it down for thy reasoning is ridiculous enough in all reason and conscience with a gesture of derision such as that of him who sits in heaven and smiles to see the silly shifts and vain imaginations of those that plot and set against him and his anointed or that of him that said cry aloud for he is god perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened or that of sion who shook her head at hers and preachers that held many truths which must not be rejected of god

at which thou wast ut bellarminus enervatus as one that had no more to say as to that matter for thy mouth was stopt from reading what thou intendedst as well it might for it would have been of as little effect to convict me of popery with which thou confessest was then charged as tis for me to say no when lyers and unbeleivers charge me with it which avails no more as the proverb is then for one to bo to a goose
and now thou hast after thy silence by which it was then taken for granted that thou hadst quitted me thereupon from thy rash charging me with popery here raked it up again among thy rest of thy remarkable folly what meanst thou by thy new mention thereof hast thou any more then before thou hadst did not cardinall bellarmine hold some truths which thou holdest as well as some that hold against thee and that christ is the son god which we both hold where lyes the consequence of thy argument to mine more then to thy own complyance with that popish cardinall thou ownst some false apostaticall tenets that he own'd namely that of tithes when own no other then his apostolicall truths is he not so far thy brother bellarmine more then mine

moreover as light and little as made of thy charge of popery shall make so much of my making little of it then as now to make a weighty argument against thee from it and conclude contrarily to thy conclusion of me from thence to bein pay from the pope for that is not so light a matter as the case stands here in england that any man thats well in his wits and knowes himselfe to be guilty thereof had need make light and little of seeing his neck lyes at stake and his life is not a little concern'd in't if it can be proved
whereas therefore concludes thus of me viz s.f before hundreds of people made light of the charge of popery therefore in all likelihood he is guilty of what he is charg'd with viz complying with and receiving a pension from the pope
conclude thus viz before hundreds of people made light of his being charg'd of complying with and taking pay from the pope which were a matter of very dangerous consequence if he were to himselfe of it that any one of those hundreds who wanted no will to it could possibly prove it therefore in all likelihood there is no such matter

and as to two others of the mean mediums which makes what use he can of to make men mistake me to be such a complyer with the roman antichrist viz that said at dunkirk looked upon the iesuits and friars there to be sounder in doctrine then those he and his call the reformed that the doctrines which broach are theirs and a fair to their bag and baggage for this last of which as here expresse it t.d affords the world no more proof then his own single say so but for the other to advance the faith of his saint hearted reader into a full assurance of the truth thereof that thick and threefold testimony viz that of his single folded self and his old pair of double trustees
fox's ton bur who saving t.d's commendation of their honesty and credibility which that single hearted friend of truth burrough with whom went and was at dunkirk hath seen as little of as my selfe have dealt

more and barbarian like then like honest and credible men or conscientious christians with whom yet as look for no more satisfaction from then their to god nor amends then their amendment so wish no worse to the worst of them for the worst evill they have done to me and the truth then that god would grant them both true repentance to the acknowledgement thereof that the lake of judgement and condemnation which must come upon all lyes and all deceit may not throw their continuance in impenitency therein be the portion of their persons for ever say as to the two assertions above whence he infers the foresaid charge deny them both as false for did not tell it in those termes that the iesuits and friars are in doctrine in grosse and in the lump as is here falsely witnessed and related then the reformed churches as yee call them but to this effect viz that setting aside their and superstitions in matters of their outward worship and service in which acknowledged them though t.f and t.b or else thy selfe being minded to wrong me would not vouchsafe the world an acknowledgment of all my words to be far more full of manifest foolery and manifold idolatry then the other the jesuits friars were sounder in some doctrines then some of the men cal'd ministers in the said reformed but in many things still too much churches and now with the nominations of thy self t.d whom then named not as one of those ministers then whom excepting ever their gross superstition some iesuits and fryars in some points of doctrine are more reformed here give thee the advantage of my saying the same ore again and make the best use of it thou canst to draw from hence an assurance to thy self and others of my probable complyance with the popish faction am sure thou canst draw no more then this with the best piece of twist that the best of thy affords that in some points agree with them wherein thou dissentest from them though in most things differ from them and to their faces appear more against them then thy self

and if thou wilt have no nay but that this must be compliance then shake ye hands with them and be friends who in tithes and twenty things more pertaining to the parish churches wherein we contradict you both do comply with them and if they that renounce them in twenty things to one shall be counted one with them if they agree in any thing at all then according to the rule of quae conveniunt in aliquo tertio by my consent qui conveniunt in aliquo uno erunt idem such as are disjoyned in a thousand things and yet happen to jump together in some one shall not only in that one respect be counted one but in all respects whatsoever be joyned and jumbled together as all one

as to the other saying if by broaching thou mean no other than preaching some doctrines so are owned by them though if by broaching thou mean bringing any new doctrine that was not held or heard of hitherto or in these days till declared it de novo deny thy talke of my broaching it is untrue for as declare no other message or doctrine then what was from the beginning before the letter was about the light and some other things which

the letter tells of even the good old way wherein the saints walked with god from abell enoch noah and so downwards unto this day which way hath been much ecclipsed by the dark divinity of divines in ages past so the first and new venting of that old way of the light which is new as by the passing of the darknesse it begins anew to shine was not from this earthen vessel of mine but other vessels of honour sanctified and fitted for the masters use and chosen to bear his name from whom received it through gods mercy in their ministry which thou de pisest the new wine of gods wisdom which now vents it self and flowes forth of the new bottles into which god puts it which only are capable of it for yee old bottles cannot contain nor comprehend it in the blindnesse of your hearts as the darknesse comprehendeth not the true light that shineth in it nor bear the infusion of any of it into your souls without bursting to pieces at the very lent thereof was both broach't and tapr and tasted of by others who came into the vinyard before me tis enough for me who am lesse then the least among the lovers of it and was once not the least of the drunkards of ephraim that are intoxicated and infatuated with that strong drink and old wine of their own till they know neither where they are nor what they say that have tasted it from the first hands that in these dayes have fill'd it forth much more that to me this grace should be given to follow in the free filling it forth to others and to preach out among the gentiles in such measure as am enrich't therewith by the free gift of god the unsearchable riches of christ iesus and if this be to breach breach not onely many true doctrines but some true ones which peradventure the papists do not deny yet deny my broaching of any any where that are a fair to their bag and baggage or any part of their dark and dead devotions trumpical traditions and total transformations of themselves and all things as to the outward form of religion from the truth it self into at best a mear empty apish imitation of it
but the doctrines ye teach in contradiction to what the qua preach in most things are not only a fair in let to it but also so fairly and fully bearing the very likenesse of it that howbeit they that are of the night see it not yet the children of the light and of the day see them to be no other then some broken bits and parts of that popery that stood here more perfectly and in gross once which our priests being loath to part with more of then they are forced to have since parcelled for their own ends among themselves some chips that flew off that old block which fled beyond sea when twas hewed away hence some stumps of the old tree under the shadow of which all england fate as other people yet do out of the sight of the sun of righteousnesse some fragments of the fryars faith some shreds odde ends old remnants rotten rags and re ikes of the old whores skirts which rome left behind her for hast when she ran a way hence which our english princes priests and people so ran a whoring after that they could never find in their hearts to send them away after her to this very day and in a word no other then the very fag end of her bag and baggage

first our doctrine of perfect purging from sin in this life is no

to it for the papists are far enough as ye are from the belief of that upon the of which in this life they build that piece of baggage viz a purgatory in the life to come which though ye cry out of as popish yet while you hold with them against us no perfect purging from sin in this world and say worse then they do in defiance of that holy truth which we stand in defence of for so ye do while ye call it a doctrine of devils yee unavoidably usher in that of purgatory in the world to come unless ye will fain another world wherein the perfect purgation must be which is neither this world nor that to come which were a chimera as bad as purgatory or say there's no perfect purging at all which were worse you must by your denyal of the perfection of it here establish a basis for that baggage to abide firm upon and open a door so wide for its entrance and entertainment as to let in the popes purgatory whether ye will or no


our doctrine of freely yee have received freely give and of preaching the gospel without mony and without price and going forth for christs names sake taking nothing of the nations our crying out as the true pastors and prophets did against the hireling shepheards that like greedy dumb dogs that cannot bark unless it be against the truth but bite shrewdly when they are not fed and yet never have enough but are ever seeking every one his gain from his quarter and our talking against tithes and the pay of parish priests which is originally of the pope and not after christ and such like this is no fair to the popish priesthoods bag nor yet any of his baggage but much rather a shutting out of them both for sure enough no more wages no more work for a masse priest here nor any where else no means none of the popes ministries nor ministrations no money no men that will preach without it no popish parish pay no more popish parish pasture nor parish formal prayer no reaping the clear tenth of corn without a farthing charge more then it costs to carry in which is the sixth of the nations grain at that rate and the cream and quintessence of all other carnal things no seminary seeds men of that sort to sow such earthen heavenly things such meer fleshly spirituallities as the spirits of that spiritually are fully fraught with no room for the rest of romes religion where taking of tithes and raking in the revennue may not be a prime part thereof keep out the wide mouth'd bag of all the lord beggers and they'l never burden england so much as these have done with their far fetcht dear bought baggage but the english priesthood preaching for hire and divining for money and taking of tithes as aforesaid and talking for them and gaping after the gain thereof and augmenting their arguments and hideous outcryes for augmentations out of the antichristian treasury of deans and chapters lands and powerfull pleadings for the popish pensions of parsonages vicaradges and and seeking and suing for such superstitious emoluments and uncessant and unfatiable callings out more maintenance more maintenance this is not onely a fair to the popes bag but also no small part of his baggage whereby his bag is upheld which receiprocally upholds his baggage for these two are the mutual and upholders

of each other and as twas said of old two good livings which some mongril can digest yet are a good step toward a lord bishop which is not far from an so how an at canterbury is next to the arch bishop at rome may be seen by such as have read how that heavenly pope calestine set anselm arch bishop of canterbury at his right foot in a general councel saying includamus hunc in orbe nostro tanquam alter us orbis papam we must in our world count upon him as a certain pope of another world

our doctrine against infant sprinkling is no fair thereto for that is another part of his baggage that supports several other parts of it which together with it support his bag which take away and his national and parochial churches fall in the fall of which much more rubbish and baggage of his fals with it which wont to fill the bag yea and much mony fails and goes beside the mouth of it which was paid for mortuaries dirgis deprofundis in the dismal dayes of his darkest dominion here besides the refuse of the cross and the gossips with whom at their gossippings the priests had many good sippings their wonted fees for christnings churchings in the late time of the font and canonicall coat the white surplice and not a little might be better spared then so ill spent as it hath been since the bason began and the white surplices are left off among the men that are yet too much for their black superfluities whose vniversity superstitious snapsacks bear a great portion of and not a little proportion to the forenamed baggage but such a practice as pleading for sprinkling of babes which is a tradition little better than their sprinkling of bells in their works gives a fair or at least forbids the of not a little of the antichristian bag and baggage though in their words they would fain seem wholly to renounce it

our doctrine against persecution is no thereto for the bloody tenets of inquisitions burnings headings hangings quarterings
in that case of conscience are as iachin and boaz were before the true temple of god that is by interpretation establishment and strength the most proper props of the popes temple and all its trumpery the most principal pillars that all his stuff stands on the bottome of his babilonish building by which poor people are so frightned into a blind obedience and conformity thereunto that whatever appears of truth to them within they dare not appear to obey nor so much as peep forth into any prosession thereof without but before there is any thing born up to suffer for it they are quickly cut off and as hernicks soon handled to dust and ashes which most beastly part of it all the rest of his babilonish baggage when ever it shall happen to be removed all the rest runs immediately to ruine

but the doctrine and practice of hating and hunting the saints to and fro as harmless hares hauking after them as saul after david as partridges about the mountains from court to court from commitee to commitee for their flesh and their egges that the tithe or else the price of the tith of their egges and geese and hens and piggs and lambs and calves and their other commodities also viz corn and hemp and

hey and hops and pears and plums and apples and other fruits of their lands in which their ministers labour not may take a trebble turne through their teeth and that of laughing mocking scoffing scorning uring houting holding haling beating kicking stocking stoning pumping prisoning fining banishing bridling bridewelling branding boring pilloring eare marking nose flitting scourging cutting slashing hanging and such like which have been used of late yet must needs say not altogether so much conniv'd at and countenanced by the magistracy that is supream corrective as caused and encouraged to by the ministry which takes upon it still in such matters to be supream directive in these which ye call the reformed churches say the doctrine and practice of such inhumanity as this which some teachers and doctors in divinity the dark places of whose earthly hearts are too full of the habitations of cruelty as well in old and specially as in italy france and spain both have and yet do plead and in some part practice against the truly tender conscientious lambs of christ whereby we may as ex pede herculem ex ungue leonem

ee what kind of wild beasts of the forrest they yet are that love christs little flock not to feed but to feed on with all their hearts are a fair inlet to the marian baggage of fire and faggot for not owning the roman faith if the magistrates do not save their longing and forbid the marching of it in more then the ministers that are ever and anon facing about and marching the old way being indeed but the dragons tayle the whereof reaches still as far as england though his head he as far off as rome a little of that crooked serpent which he left when he went away to let in himself by into these nations at his return again and the tayle or some gentle shatterings of that sharp shour and sturdy storm which fell down in greater drops of blood and flakes of in the days of her dominion here and not only so but a fair pretence for papists to bolster themselves up by in their persecutings of such as go now to tell the truth to them in their own countryes for to my knowledge its none of the least pleas they now have in other nations both protestant and popish for the groslest abuses they can do to the qua in whom else they see no harm but as from hence they are made to suspect it to say thus and thus they do to you in your own country of england where you are well known therefore no marveil if we do thus unto you here

and that the divines old and young not only have been in the darker but are even in these brighter times of protestanism it self so deeply accessary to and guilty of the aforesaid sufferings witnesse the barbarous basenesse acted and inflicted on the witnesses to the lords truth not

onely in all other quarters of this nation to say nothing of scotland ireland but also at the two eyes and well heads of divinity and nurseries of learning and true religion as they are call'd as well oxford as cambridge as they stand extant to the view of all the world as most of that of other places and cities do in sundry printed relations and testimonies thereof the reading whereof may well take hold on all tender hearts and draw tears from their eyes to see the lamentable injuries and abominable iniquities done to the saints by those painted sepulchers in a land of such godlinesse as this pretends to

witnesse also that divine doctrine of that divine doctor owen with whom have here to doe in the dayes of whose vice chancellorship what influence was given by him toward the oxford persecutions he knows as well as others and what influence his doctrine might have upon the powers to whom he often preached to the stirring them up to more persecution then they were free for if god had not made them wiser then their teachers all may see that can read it from his hand in his latine divine which am to talk with where
his own words in the margin above truly englished he teacheth thus though no men could ever yet tax them with stirring against the state
viz that the qua are not perfect nor come to christ in glory their lyes deceits wickednesses hypocrisy are evident testimony unto us but indeed those punishments and imprisonments which they voluntarily pull upon themselves by their tumultuousnesse of which they manishly complain ought of right to be inflicted upon them who impudently glory that they are free from all these and other sins even the so far forth as this peice containes o's
false accusation of the qua and pertaines to the point of perfection it may possibly come to account again in other places more proper for it then this its here related as to that relation that it bears onely to the point of persecution in which capacity who so is capable to see it may perceive by the paw he here puts forth what prey owen lack and how like them of old who cloathd christians with wilde beasts skins that they might seem to the dogs to be such and so to dogs to be baited or covered them all ore with draff and swillings and then threw them to the swine to be devoured so he first fortiter accuset loads the quakers with calumny and layes lyingly heavy things to their charge and then magistraliter satis ministerialiter magis as authoritatively as that whole tribe which must ever be in such supremacy as to direct till they come to correction themselves gives out what ought to be done with them by such as were onely us'd to correct hereticks at their appointment

the doctrine then of persecution as taught and learnt too much to this day by our english reformadoes from ramish rubbish is not onely a retaining of much of but an open dore for the rest of the popes baggage to return by as the times turn but our innocent tender tenet of liberty of conscience

is so averse to and inconsistent with it as that it turns it all up by the very roots

and whereas it may be objected that a pleading the universality of

liberty may seem to be an to popery very much for if you would have toleration for all then how will you keep out the papists bag and baggage

rep answer not with the carnall weapons of your warfare but with a sharper sword then that whereby you and they seek to keep out the truth even that with edges the light and spirit of the living god which goeth out of his mouth who is call'd the word of god who will go on conquering and to conquer all the vain imaginations in the hearts and consciences of men to cast down the strong hold of the prince of darknesse in the might and power of god and captivate every high thing that exalts in selfe against the knowledge of god and every thought to the obedience of himselfe and avenge all that disobedience of his adversaries whose ministry further then by his own permission its born down by that extrinsecall force of the beasts putting forth and interposing for a time will make its own way and cleare the truth as the light both amongst and against all false ones without either maintenance or defence or so much as good countenance if that may not be had from the higher powers of the earth being such a substantive as is well able if let alone and in the midst of not a little interruption to stand by it self in reason before any and not such a as the clergy is which cannot stand by itself to shew one glasse full of its own sense and meaning on the scripture without some constable or officer joyning with it to take that honest man or woman to the stocks or cage that by two or three good words shall disturb them nor stand by it self to shew its reason or signification to such as soberly reason with it but must require another force then that of words to resist and sometimes the rude ones to run with stones and stop the mouths of its opponents
not by might nor power of this sort but by my spirit saith the lord
that dagon that cannot stand unless its worshippers hold it up in this manner before the ark undoutedly will fall and let it fall if it will and never rise any more for me
and if papists iews and turks being obedient to the civill power in civill matters between man and man shall come in and their blind consciences in their respective blind religions they shall deceive not one of the elect and none but such as are disobedient to what they know which to stumbling they are appointed that protestanism that can't stand if popery indaism and turcism have liberty till it fall by the pure power of god and not meer man to stand peaceably by it in one nation for fear it should dye out before them let it dye out with them all when the lord will for me that truth which is to and them all may stand up alone in its proper power and native lustre when they are gone as for such protestants as would run to hell with them if papists turks and iewes should come among them they are onely such as would never come neer to heaven if these should never come neer them at all


our doctrine of the true lights enlightning every man the truth of which is to be prov'd against and in its proper place and our calling every man to attend to the shining of it in his own conscience can be no fair to the popish bag and baggage for all that arises and springs from the cloudinesse of their consciences the blindnesse of their hearts the darknesse that is in their understandings in which darknesse or dark places

which are in the heart the true light shines though the darknesse comprehends it not and the minds of men consider it not which if they would once doe so well as to take heed to the day would dawn the day star arise at last in their hearts the light shine forth the shadowes fly away the clouds scatter the vaile that overspreads them vanish the face of the covering be removed the of this world in which the devill who is the prince and ruler of it dwells diggs deceives devoures destroyes udoes does all he has to doe who hath nothing in christ the light nor ought to doe in them that dwell out of his reach under christs protection in the would be dispeld and the of a better religion worship gospell faith knowledge holynesse salvation redemption kingdome then any power and glory they yet are aware off or your selves either would break forth upon them

but such as your tenet is who rebell against the light not knowing the job

and band yourselves together against the blowers of it up in men to blow it out what yee can denying it to be in any measure at all in any but very few quarrelling with the quakers for calling any much more all to take heed to it that they might walk up in singlenesse to to what of god by it is made known in them doth both river england into a resolution to retain so much of romes bag and baggage as is yet remaining and into their and the priests wonted readinesse to receive more or all of it again if it shall so return as in and be handed out to them by the threatning helping hand of those that have the highest handling of the helm

our doctrine of the infallibility of the true ministry of christ which we say is that which is among them call'd quakers in these dayes as in those of old can be no fair to the antichristian bag and baggage or to those ministries or ministrations for to teach which is not more taught by me then shall be proved against and who both deny it more at large in its proper place viz that the infaible spirit continues his infallible direction guidance and inspirations to the true and church which waits upon him now in such wise as heretofore is so far from leting in that it shuts out for ever their all its a coutrements as false fictitious and yours also who as to your confessed fallibility are of the same feather with them who as in that ye flock so must flee and fall and fail all together seeing saving onely that they ascribe infalibility to their the pope as yee doe not and spirits inspirations to his single sacred soul they count it for any minister or other to say they have the holy spirit so onely as to assure them of gods love and acceptance much more to make them infallible in their ministry and though you hold men may have it to assure them of salvation yet as to its assumed and infallible guidance of your selves in yours or any men at all in their ministrings now you count it little lesse then the same and differing so as to the matter of the ministry no further from them then thus viz that whereas they hold infallibility but falsely enough fixing it to that false subject the breast of their of christ and supream here on earth yee deny it to be in ministers at all now to the utter of your selves and evincing it yee are none of christs any more then they

but so to teach that all ministries that pretend to christ are fallible in these dayes and not one christian ministry infallible the earth nor any one of all them that are in england at this day no nor yet so much as that of your own is a doctrine and a peice of news which if it were not a little more strange then true for one here is though it be not yours is a very fair to and by my might without much scruple usher in that old antichristian ministry and its pertenances here again as that which may stand welny with as much safety to peoples souls and give as good security and infallible assurance of its guiding and conducting them infallibly to salvation as your own can doe since that at the worst is little worse then fallible and your own by your own consent at the best is little better for its much at one to me and other poor people of it what mnistry stands here in england if in a case of such main moment and eternall concernment there stands none that by the spirit of god are made in their ministrations infallible if there be no guides to be had save such as are fain to confesse they are but fallibly guided themselves or if in this case there be no other as the proverb is then hobsons choice to be made which is chuse whether you will have this or none one blind guide being to me little better then another if others would be rul'd by me would chuse none of that sort at all but cleave to the light and spirit it selfe which is infallible and leads all that follow it into all truth for if the blinde lead the blind whether papists or protestants they must all at last into the ditch and if england must have an outward ministry and by no meanes will be made to own that ministry of the qua now among them which is of god seeing it is so that none of all those other she takes hold on in this day of her breaches saying thou hast cloathing be thou our ruler in things of god let this ruine be made up under thy hand that answer her any other then so as isa
will not be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor cloathing am not guided infallibly my selfe am a deceivable erring man dare not say my ministry is unerring make me not a ruler of the people seeing say theres none to guide her assuredly among all her own sons she brought forth isa
neither any that taketh her by the hand infallibly to direct her among all the sons she hath brought up with great care cost and charge at her own universities here at home but they are all at a losse within themselves up and down in a mist their divinest doctors confessing and declaring that to be justly come upon them which god aid should isa to
viz that its night to them they can't infallibly divine the vision of all is become as a book sealed to them they can't read though advise her not to give way to any of those guides yet she could have neither more nor lesse said to her if she should send for some of her own native sons to come home and guide her that are brought up in the english colledge at the popes own charge at rome it selfe· but if she be resolved no more to be foold with a fallible ministry but will have one that is infallible as would or none at all then if she mean never to bear the popes bag and baggage in truth as she talks she will not let her take the infallible spirit within for her guide and no man without but such as are guided infallibly by it which guides none fallibly that unfainedly follow it as thousands of quakers do and if any seem to do it and do not they in

so doing undo themselves but know no other men call'd ministers in all the world beside the qua that so much as pretend to infallibility but he that in the infallible chaire


neither is our doctrine of the light and spirits being the rule of the true faith and good life and not the externall text or letter of the scripture onely any fair for the bag and baggage for howbeit they take not the text thereof to be their onely truest touchstone most certain standard and measure of truth and doctrines as we doe not yet that they take for their sure and certain rule which we say with you is a manifold more fallible matter yea by an hundred degrees more fallible then the most falsified coppy of the scripture that ever yet came forth is something that stands more at staves end and at a far wider distance from that aforesaid rule of ours then from yours who for your rule and doe own no other then the scripture by how much two things whereof the one is fallible the other infallible are further off each other by far then two things are both which are at most no more then fallible for the light and spirit of christ which we onely do and all christians ought to own for their standing rule and trusty teacher are and will hereafter in the proper place for that be proud to be to but your professed standard which is no other then that outward text and the papists which is no other then tradition taken from that dark and worse then dubious oracle viz the erring and mouth of their great grand ghostly father excepting ever that this is far more fallible then the former i.e then the letter are both but fallible
your doctrine then who teach the meer text which is but fallible as must anon be shew'd to be the most true touchstone comes neerer to the papists doctrine who teach another thing to be the most true touchstone which what ere you say of the infallibility of yours and they of the infallibility of theirs is at best but fallible and at worst but more fallible then yours is then ours possibly can do which is on all hands own'd to be infallible
and howbeit the scripture which lyes in the midway between us and papists so that till they march so far towards us as to own it better then they do they and we are never likely to meet in one unlesse they can come ab ad extremum from their ill extream to our true extream and misse the as they cannot howbeit the scripture and its honest owners are really neerer and dearer to us then they and their most trusty traditions are which they take from their sore aid ocle yet is there not so vast a disproportion and betwen owners as ye are of the scripture for the only rule and such as own that treasury of traditions that lyes lockt up in the pope breast as the only rule as is between these and us who own as our only rule the true light of christ and the holy spirit the inconsistency being not so much between your meer fallible and their more fallible chaire as it is between the most assuredly holy spirit and their most assuredly fallible though supposed infallible holy chair


our doctrine of the fallibility of the bare letter of the scripture and of its lyablenesse to corruption and its being corrupted and falsified by mistranscriptions so as to have various lections in the most originall

copyes of it that are extant in greeke hebrew at this day which remains to be in its proper place proved against who pleads that kind of purity of it to every tittle and undefined span alphabet ad nauseam is no fair to the bag baggage though find so supposing giving us out his sole suppositions and thoughts that tis but a supposition that it is corrupted and such a one as by which is supported speaking in at least three places of his english peice to this same purpose viz
what use been made and is as yet in the world this supposition that corruptions have befallen the of the scripture which those various lection meaning those that the to the biblia polyglotta do declare at view seem to intimate need not
it is in briefe foundation of and principall prop of popery the onely pretence of fanaticall and the root of much atheisme in the world also
now if this be taken and every may be for differences and these presently pinted for various lections there is no doubt but we may have enough of them to poor unstable souls into the of the pretended judge also to say nothing here of the hideous affrightments dangers fears of who is oft afraid then hurt and other of the dreadfull and desperate consequences of this as he calls it though a reall truth that corruptions and various lections are crept into his originall text of the scripture and that protestants begin now to sent it as well as papists and to be infected with the leprosy of that opinion which he trembles think of as an which he knows no whither it will grow and fears whether many will not be ready to question the of the letter as dubious and uncertain and not fit to be the rule as sure enough they will when they begin to see what some have felt and cry out with him undefined span alphabet seeing that their supposed firm foundation to be fallible and falsified as it is having no more yet to releive himselfe against this uncertainty of his standing then that comfort viz that the generality of men among protestants are not yet but how soon they may be he is not aware with this leven which hurries and pittifull puthers and dreadfull deale ado that the makes in his about this up and down in the
and other pages of his preface and throw out the little chapter of his
treatise which is so falsly figured that the pages cannot easily be coted are enough to make some wise men smile that never meant it say to let passe all that at present among other mischiefs that he conceives will accrue if men conceive the scripture to have had by the fate of other books and that in their originall copyes this must needs be one that they have no where else to betake themselves for a rule but to run back to rome witnesse his last words of that forecited chap which are these viz and if this change of judgement which hath been long insinuating it selfe by the curiosity and boldnesse of criticks should break in also upon the protestant world and be avowed in publike works it is easie to conjecture what the end will be
we went from rome under the conduct of the purity of the originalls wish none have a mind to return thither under the pretence of their corruption

but stay a while is there for such as are lost no way out of the wood but that one of thy own fancying or else that other of the papists

which is worse then none is there nought for men to doe but either they must stare with thee or else for fear of they know not what run stark mad with them either fall in with thy meer figments about the scripture or else if they find it not as infallible in every apex of it as thou foolishly fainest be frightend strait into the more fallible fantasmes of that fantasticall holy father

sure if that judgement that the same fate as to the creeping of corrupttions into it hath befallen that writing as hath done other scripture be a to where popery at stands yet thou wilt find some who are of the papists mind about the scripture as far as to the variety of lections which are found in the very text thereof who yet have betaken themselves to and doe stand on such a sure foundation as will when popery and common too shall faile for ever with whom neither one nor th other of these are ith same nature still though fighting for their different foundations and foolish formes so standing can have any fellowship who instead of returning to under a pretence of corruption in your originalls under the conduct of your conceited purity of which ye came from thence are running further and faster then ever from rome and you too that live within her lines of communication still and feed upon the taile of her traditions more then on the true word of god for all your wording it so much against them and for the word under the infallible conduct of the pure originall it self even the pure light living word and spirit of god by which abell enoch noah walked with god of before your but pretended rule was written in respect of which the eldest of your originalls are but upstarts and from which the best of your originalls had their being
nevertheless who hath believed our report to whom is this arme of the lord revealed nugas quantum est in inane quis legit haec vel duo vel neimo
cannot see this and few or none of our skilful scribs and scripturists can read this though the scripture sends them from it self to that it came from nor yet how by raking so unreasonably to make men believe that of the scripture which tis unposible for any that can truly read them to believe of them or find from themselves himself frightens honest souls from any further giving of much heed to his own judgement when by a serious search they shall find the falshood of it in so plain and palpable a case as that is he so miserably miscarries in but whether they will give most heed to christ or no and to his light in the conscience and word in the heart or to the bare letter of the scripture which only testifies of him without ever coming to him that they may have the life or to the pope
leave it a little time will now detect it howbeit some may go one way some another and like to like and each to what and to whom he best loves and likes but christs sheep to whom he onely gives eternal life they will assuredly heare his voice which who doeth not must be cut off from among his people


our doctrine of the vniversal grace and general love of god to all mankind in giving christ intentionally to be a saviour to all that all

that are lost in the fall of the first man may be in possibility and true capability of redemption and salvation by him without a bolt by any personal reprobation of the most therefrom with no reference to their acting any evill and that unchangeably before they had a being unless themselves obicem debarr themselves from the benefit thereof by rejecting the council of god against themselves by an obstinate resisting the strivings of his spirit with them to bring them to it and a wilful putting away of the word of eternal life when by christ its brought nigh even in their hearts and mouths that they may hear and do it this is no fair to their bag and baggage this perhaps is assented to as truth by the papists the more shame for the most of our hypocritical churles that gainsay it who would be but must be no more called liberal and bountiful while they are bold to utter errour against the lords large love as if he were such a niggard as themselves who care not how few men be saved provided that their be not damned but elected to be saved in their sins without being perfectly purg'd from them before they die by christ of whom they must yet once know what yet they will not that he came to save all people from all sin who willing to be saved and not to give any such darlings of his as they darkly deem themselves to be an allowance in the least or a dispensation to sin throw infirmity till they die and then to save them from the desert thereof after death the instruments of which vile are evil to destroy the poor people of god with their lying words when they speak no other then right things

but what if the romish clergy do hold such a general grace of god they are by so much the more of a noble spirit then your selves who deny it in the owning of that most pretious truth if they were not far worse then yourselves in other mattters and as for us called qua who preach it here for truth as against and it must anon be prov'd to be in the proper place as we take neither it nor ought else to be truth by tradition from papists or the more because they own it but as our selves have received it from the muoth of god so hope you wise men will grow wiser by then have done then to judg we must either reject truth it self if their church once hold it or else be judged to be of them while we hold it with them and as in holding it out freely as we do other truths we neither fill nor feed as you do your own by holding in the truth their as hypocritical as hydropical bag so it being no worse then that golden gospel truth which ye divines darken so much by your dirty distinctions and meer guilded glosses could we make such fair for it that it might shine forth in its brightness as it once will do from one end of england to another we should in so doing usher in no part of their baggage but indeed your selves in standing against it have not only stor'd your bag more then is fit for men to do that make a trade of treading down the truth but have brought in a piece of babylonish baggage of your own as bad if not worse then all the popes for its all one to me what outward religion men be of true or false papism or

protestanism or whether they have any at all among them yea or nay if it be so as our personal electionists absit blasphemia breath it forth verbatim or at least doctrinally and in effect that the mercy of the almighty which is said to abound to and over all and extend beyond all his other works and his infinite large and incomprehensible love to all men is yet no larger then may be comprehended in that little corner whereinto they croud it so as to say that one of a thousand only are decreed to be saved and a thousand to one of the sons and daughters of men without respect to any evil foreseen in their proper persons to be acted in time are from all eternity decreed by god himself and that unchangeably and everlastingly to be damned for then that one of a thousand shall assuredly be saved and a thousand to one as inalterably perish and die eternally and this or that outward religion is no remedy against that which was so ordered long before the poor creatures had any being

and as one said once unto me for whom twill be better then he deserves if our god take him not at his word viz he would not own that god that would own a qua to be one of his children so say but not so desprately as he did the other know and own no other god but him who will own all to be his children who will unfainedly own him to be their father and save all them that are truly willing in his way to be saved from their sins by him who never yet declared himself willing to save any in them who sent his son a light in the world not to condemn it but to that intent that the world which loving darknesse rather then light will needs be damned through his light notwithstanding might be saved and will shew mercy upon all them who will have pitty upon themselves so far as not to despise the riches of his grace and reject his unfained tenders and honest offers thereof when they are made neither do own him to be my god for my god is a god of mercy and truth to all who without any respect to their personal rejectings thereof in time wills never to have mercy upon most who would have any to perish and not have all to come to repentance who would not truly have all as well as some to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth who hath any pleasure at all that the very wicked much more that the innocent should die that delighteth in the death of him that dieth and had not really rather that he should turn from his wickednesse and live that means any otherwise then he sayes or is quite contrary to what he seems to be in his speeches to either good or bad that hath two wills within himself whereof one is contradictory to the other that reveals his will to be this that he's no specter of persons but all men as they do shall have that the soul that sins shall die but that that turns and does righteousnesse shall live that men die at their own wills and choice not his and yet hath a secret will within himself which as secret as they call it yet our priests will be twatling of it openly ever and anon as if they knew it as well as the other wherein he wills and chuses that a few only shall live and irresistably by them or ought they shall ever do a thousand to one shall die that sends out his son as a mocker of most men by

calling them all to believe every one that he is his and is come to be his saviour when yet he died not for every individual but contrary to his revelation in the scripture gave himself a ransom not for all but only for a few that makes an of salvation to all by christ but intends it only to some few that sends out his ministers with a lye in their mouths for a truth it is not say our yet they will preach it viz that love and good will is truly towards them all and every one may lay claim to it as well as any one when yet according to their doctrine at other times there's no such matter as this but his love is only to some certain ones which he secretly selects and yet he can't do it so secretly neither but they must tell on't to as many as they tell the other that sends his ministers to make every man believe that christ died for him in particular which if every man should believe according to their other will of god which but that they are should be called his secret will which is that he gave not christ to tast of death for every man but for very few most men must believe a very lye and yet if every man believe it not for himself he must be damned too for not believing of that which according to themselves still is no truth but a very that condemns the world of sin iohn
because they believe not in christ as their saviour and yet leaves the world which say our preachers christ died not to save for he died only for such as are not of it without any saviour that is theirs to believe in that on pain and peril of his eternal displeasure requires men like pharoah whom he plagu'd for his cruelty in the self same case to make such a of and yet yeelds them no straw wherewithal to do it but leaves them to go look it where they can

he that doth thus and much more of the like nature which the doctrine of such as deny the vniversal grace of god doth in effect represent their god as doing may be own'd as a god by such as make him one and by the ministers of his own making yet is not owned by me to be the true god of gods but a god of his own ministers own making to themselves after the image of their own vain imaginations yet such a god as this are tombs baxter and the whole diacony of that deny the death of christ for all men devising and imagining to themselves of whom till they come to know and own the true god which is mine in his mercy truth and faithfulnesse a little better then they do or can by that dark lantern of their own understandings in which they are poring after him in the letter only besides his own light and spirit in which only he is seen as he is must say so much and of my self together with them that whosoever is the father of myself or of them we are not yet one and the same fathers children


our doctrine about good works and our preaching and maintaining and pleading for good works as necessary for many good uses against or any other this is no fair to the bag and baggage for all good works as are so indeed and not only so by such as call good evil and evil good are of god and christ jesus

the truth and none of the pope nor of his priests nor any other meer man that know of neither are there any that can truly be so called for what thou or the pope or any papists or protestants falsly call good works is another case not at all pertaining to our purpose to be found for ought see in his whole budget of religious implements nor in the whole masse or magazine of his massy matters and tis more then shall see while see you but besides much more against that light in which only that is done which goes for good in the account of god if there be any good works truly good to be found yet among the best of your own know you have a whole warehouse of religious works such as they are which you are accustomd to call good as they do theirs but what your good works are in your own sight is one and what they are in the sight of god is another question there is a generation wo to them that are wise in their own eyes prudent in their own sight yet very fools in the sight of god there is a generation wo to them also that call evil good and good evil put darknesse for light and light for darknesse bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter there is a generation how are their eyes and their lifted up wo to them also for they are a stink in his nostrills and as smoak in his nose before the lord that are pure in their own eyes and yet are not nor ever mean to be while they live fully washed from their filthynesse have read of a generation that had more good works as they count them to count upon then all the national churches of either protestants or papists and works more good as to the matter of them if what matter god requires may be counted better then what is required by meerly man all whose whole treasury of solemn services out of which they offer'd to him was yet in the fight of god esteemed but trash so long as twas the sinner only that so served and sacrificed and no other then cain the evil doer still that did that good such were all the haughty mincing daughters of zion that walk't with stretcht out necks and bosted in the bravery of their tinkling ornaments their sabbaths burnt offerings prayings prayses fasts and feasts in which when they drew near to god they did no more then what he by moses had appointed as ye do for which you have your labour for your paines who worship not after his own praecepts and doctrines in outwards but after the commandements and traditions of men and of the pope himself in many things still and yet because they did not so much as he appointed them in matters of more moment but were unclean and wicked refusing to walk in the good old way of the light which was the way before moses and the letter was turning away their eare from hearing the law in the heart which is the light were not only vain but abominable in the very best of their oblations

in preaching therefore in order to gods acceptance of us and our good works which are not outward worships where the heart and life are yet defiled but where a new creature created after his own image of god in christ iesus to good works in his nature and by his power though in it's own person doth perform them is as an utter

exclusion of all your own so no fair to any of the popish rubbish will worship meer self service and unprofitable devotion for these being only done by man are neither good nor accepted of god

but to teach and maintain and plead for evil works as necessary to be done while we are in this life and teach down the doctrine of perfecting holinesse and perfect purging our selves from all uncleannesse of flesh and spirit while we are here in the body which paul taught up as a doctrine of devils and to deny the possibility of performing this duty of not sinning and make such a grosse state of sin as that was which david stood in when he was guilty of adultery and murder consistent with gods acceptance of men and their justification before him and that the saints as some call them in such a pickle while they are in sin up to the ears even in such a case are not in a condemned but in a justified estate and that if the saints own heart condemn him and his own conscience tell him that god doth not accept him and that his estate is bad in such a bad sinful case and not good it's defiled and lyes and testifies falsehood to him and leads him into a wrong opinion of himself and that the saints may be blessed men as david was having no guile in his spirit but sincere upright after gods own heart though under the guilt of so grosse and great sins when the scripture saith the contrary viz that david was upright before god saving in that matter of vriah wherein indeed his very heart was false and rotten and to affirm to the encouragement of men in their imperfections and infirmityes by which name they stile the saints grossest iniquities as t.d does contradictorily to himself in other places that the gospel gives life upon imperfect obedience all which and more ejusdem farraginis is done and utter'd by t.d and such as own him therein in the
pages of his
pamphlet as they were by word of mouth at the disputes this is to strengthen the hands of the wicked that they cannot return from their wickednesse for how is it possible they should do it when tis preacht and believed as impossible to be done this is to sow soft pillows under their elbowes that they may sleep on securely in sin and take their rest for its all but infirmity and no inpreachment to his justification nor to his standing accepted and in covenant with god that a saint does and theirs no condemnation to them that are saints and in christ no though they be in transgression in which who is say is out of christ and not a saint and though they walk not after the spirit as all that are saints and in christ jesus do but after the flesh and in a word a very fair to a very worse matter then that whole mare mortuum of the popes beggerly observations even no better a matter then the very whole bundle of the devils own bag and beastly baggage

so then see not hitherto and am perswaded never shall till come to see as t.d does in his floting fancy many things with his eyes shut how any doctrines of the qua even such as they and hold with any more then what we hold flatly against the popish priesthood do either conclude my complyance with them or make any way for the incoming and abiding without its own speedier ruine of their romish

baggage or how our parochiall priesthoods preaching and practice too doth any other then uphold the butt end thereof and preach their own with those their brother ravens in many matters

but t.d biggest bolt and weightest bullet as he counts at least lyes yet behind and that is our doctrine of good works as needful to that use of our justification before god here he iudges that omne tulit punctum he hath fully hit the white and that this will do if all the rest die and fallen the fault of favouring and fathering the popish cause upon me as some if all the other fail good works for necessary uses viz to manifest faith to be true to sanctify to make meet for the possession t.d and his associates in words and doctrinally more then practically maintain as much as any but to maintaine good works not only to the use of our sanctification but our justification and to justify not only in the sight of men but also formally in the sight of god not only to approve a beleiver but absolve a sinner
not only to fit for but to give right to the inheritance
not as concurrent and concomitant only but as cooperative and constitutive together with faith and coincident as a cause in the case of our iustification to let good works be accounted not only via ad regnum but also carsa regnandi as your scools distinguish yea and further yet to dispute it not in these terms barely of good works but in these terms of our good works and lastly higher yet to rank them so high in order of causes as not only instrumental with faith but a deserving or meritorious cause of justification this is notorious yea so grosse and popish that we may well rank you thinks he among the papists
as at least a bringer in of their baggage yea now quoth t.d of me
you shew your self a rank papist indeed
rep ipse dixit t.d hath said it who of all those seers with his eyes in sandwich or else where who giving heed to him from the least to the greatest saying of him this man is the great power of god have hitherto bewitched with his simonical sorceries can do any other then believe it to a tittle
this stroke enters with so deep a dint into the thoughts fancies and faith of many that tis supposed by some we qua shall never be able to lick our selves whole of the deadly wound it brings with it both to the doctrines that we maintain as truth and to our selves also whom we maintain to be no rank papists nor rankers of our with them against the truth in our maintaining of doctrines must therefore since the lord hath laid it upon me if all the world would take me off it take leave here to enlarge so far as to enter the lists in one short single duel with t.d alone about these matters desiring to have patience and stand by a while longer till can have while to handle him and t.d both at once in those points wherein they two joyne and issue out together making as it were but one head as to the doctrines wherein they oppose against the qua and the rather because find not in his book which elsewise is brotherly enough with t.d in bitternesse against the truth and qua intermedling much there what ere he thinks in this so momentary a matter

as for
have sundry things to reckon and reason with him in aboutit

am to have a talking with thee t.d in a few words for a certain abuse or injury done by thee in that passage of thine
wherein thou relatest that the
question debated on by us was stated in these termes viz whether our good works are the meritorious cause of our justification that not onely held it in the affirmative but also disputed it in those termes of our good works in such wise as the papists do so as to shew my selfe a rank papist which injury in regard of the extent of it to the severall persons wronged is not more manifest then manifold yea verily sevenfold more then ordinary for as much as no lesse then seven persons are thereby most grossely abused and belyed that is to say not only my selfe whom onely thou intendedst should suffer by it but also thy selfe and five of thy chiefe friends too for want of thy forecast viz of them thou gentlemen

and three of thy master ministers

whose witnesse thou appealest to who are all more moderate and gentle men then thy selfe it seemes as to their testimony in this matter for they all and thy selfe too who bring'st them to bear witnesse with thee of the truth in this case do with one accord together with thee testifie another thing which is the very truth and no more then the truth viz see
of thine own narrative that the termes of the question were whether good
works be the meritorious cause of our justification which as tis there said truly was expressely affirmed by us without that figmentitious particle ovr in the sence thou usest it in which is of thine own forging and foisting in and adding to that term good works the adding of which in the eye of any save such as are not either arrand fooles or else as the proverb is more knaves then fools which yet is in plain terms the plain case of all that wink against the truth and will not seem to see it when they do doth alter the state of the question so as to make it utterly another for who but such as either cannot see or which is worse may see and will not can chuse but understand that whether ovr good works at least in that sottish and sordid sense wherein the papists hold it do justifie is one question and whether good works do justifie is another in which st sense of the papist when they say ovr good works whose good works as they call them are no better than other mens own are whose own meerly are all stark naught neither do nor ever did affirm our iustification to come but in the latter viz that good works meaning only those of christs own working in and for us by the same power and spirit by which he did good works in that person in which he liv'd and dyed at ierusalem then whom know no other that can without his power work any good confesse both then did affirm and own and as then did in the power of christ so ever shall both affirm evince and maintain

and whether it was in this latter sense only or in the former popish in which thou t.d art impudent enough to assert held it he that will in no wise beleive me if speak in my own case nor any that side with me in the truth but had rather give credit to t.d let him beleive t.d with all my heart provided he do but take his testiomy to

be where its strongest for then he cannot but beleive me to be belyed for that t.d who in
sayes the question was stated in these termes good works which was the same t.d undoutedly that sayes the other doth flatly gainsay and clearly contradict that t.d
and prove him a lyar that saves
it was stated in these termes ovr good works and if any doubt which of these two testimonies of t.d may most securely be taken for truth seeing they are
contrary testimonies of one and the same man viz that in
wherein he wrongs me or that of his own in
which appeale to for right and am willing to be tryed by as touching his false charge of me as saying our good works justifie say unlesse the reader mean to wrong more then himselfe or me either by his misbeleife namely not only such of my friends as witness truth with me but also of t.d's
own most eminent and credible witnesses so as to judge them also to be all lyars he must beleive what t.d sayes
namely that affirm'd good works justifie and beleive that to be a lye which t.d sayes
namely that affirm'd our good works justifie for t.d alone on his own head only sayes this last but t.d together with his
witnesses assert the other

thus then stands this case between me and thy selfe t.d thou arraignest me openly at the bar before the world
as a papist as saying in these termes that our good works are the meritorious cause of our justification to which inditement pleading not guilty of saying ovr good works but good works are the cause how wilt thou be tryed quoth the impartiall iudge the honest hearted reader that would find out the truth in the court of his own conscience whether thou be guilty of affirming and disputing the said position expressely in those termes or not guilty reply by god and the country what evidence bringst thou in quoth the righteous reader to t.d against s.f whom thou so accusest what were the termes in which he and the qua expressely affirm'd it the termes of the question were these quoth t.d
whether good workes he the meritoricus cause of our justification which was expressely affirmed by them

thus am cleared in the sight of god and all men from t.d's
accusation by the true evidence of t.d himselfe my accuser for we have not accusatum but accusantem reum confitentem not the falsely accused but the falsely accusing malefactors own confession to his own confutation and confusion that the position was asserted not in the same termes in which at first he related it to be asserted in so that what need any further witnesse for ye your selves of all sorts that read t.d's book may read the truth in his own testimony but if any finding t.d so fickle as to say and unsay judg him not fit to be heeded in what he sayes whether against me or against himselfe and will needs heare what others say in the matter whether affirm'd our good works or good works only meritorious
need not trouble the world with the summoning in of more witnesses since fas est vel ab hoste doceri such as t.d hath appealed to himselfe shall stand for me for as t.d sayes to the proving of t.d to be a lyar in what he sayes
that twas good works so oxenden

boys barry seyliard nicols agree in their witnesse with him and for ought find as he sayes
so they say all and he that will not beleive them doth what in him lyes make them to be lyars like him as well as t.d in
that truth
which himselfe and they with him do all assert
does not only make himselfe a lyar but also what in him lyes abuse not only me and himselfe but all them also so as to make them seem lyars also together with him

now then
let me expostulate with thee a little on thine own and thy freinds behalf couldst thou not me in some better way then that
whereby thou givest the lye if men were such fooles as to beleive thy single self before thy selfe and
witnesses both to thy selfe and them all in that truth ye all
testify together if thou wouldst in no wise spare me who can expect no sparing but rather a shooting out of your poysoned arrowes against me even lying words who also can and do forgive thy forgery so far as it reaches only to the ill reputation of my selfe yet thou mightest have been contented to have spared thy friends thy gentlemen and ministers who as thou saift of them in thy epistle to the reader are witnesses of the termes of the questions agreed to by the qua to free thee from the suspition of a partiall so as not to have laid them lyable to suspition of lying by thy lying
against thy own and their true testimony
or if not them yet at least have spared thy selfe so far as not to have stained thy self and thine own reputation and not have subjected thy selfe in the hearts of all to not only a shrew'd suspition but welny a certain censure of forgery so much as thou hast done in handling thy ill matters no better and making thy invented tale hang no more handsomly together then it does for which how far soever forgive thee and thou in favour to thy selfe mayst possibly give pardon to thy own selfe supposed saintship as freely as thou dost to david and all saints in theirs in thy own foulest faults and abominations yet every reader that loves the truth which thou hast wronged will remember and not so readily forget how eminently the lord hath left t.d in his envious undertakings to manifest the qua folly to all men instead thereof most palpably to manifest his own neither when the up to visit and to reckon and to enter into judgment with him for it will the seeming saint without confession and forsaking so easily as he supposes find from him the forgiveness of his falshood

henceforth therefore t.d take heed of lying at all to thy own hurt or if for want of love to it thou must needs bely the truth and its children for which wo and no lesse then the lake must be thy portion yet for thy credits sake a while have a care another time of lying so directly against thy self but remember that mendacem esse memorem it behoves a lyar to have his wits better about him then thou had'st in this busines least by going about to wrong another a great deal he do not only in foro dei but hominum also before men wrong himself not a little as thou hast done who at this time not thy so much as thy craft was thine to catch thee in the snare which thou laid'st and to pull thee into the pit and draw thee down into the ditch which thyself digg'dst for another for

though thou travailedst with iniquity and conceivedst mischief and broughtest forth against thy but unfained friend s.f yet is it in such a foolish unsubtle manner that the mischief of the serpent who was scarce like his in the mannaging of this matter returns and so it ever must till it be bruised let him lye never so wisely upon his own head and his violent dealing and of the truth comes unawares upon his own pate so honi soir qui mal perse evil still to him that evil thinks and howbeit fallere fallentim est fraus as they speak for a man to deceive himself in that very thing wherein he hoped to deceive another is one of the most honest and harmlesse peices of deceit that know and the least of all to befound fault with yet so it hath happened to t.d in this one peice of his against me and the truth that he hath as he saith he intended to do
beat the devil at his own weapon and outshot him in his bow yea and overshot himself so exceedingly as that not aiming right when he bent his bow

to shoot at a pigeon he kild a crow
that then affirmed good works to deserve iustification own and still affirm the same but deny that that there affirmed and here affirm that then did and still do deny the papist best works which are not good what ere they call them to deserve iustification or our own best works either who know no good works that we have but what christ who works no evil works by his power worketh in and by us which as they are done by him in us are not ours but distinctively from ours tim

tit
called his and as they are done by us throw his power in us are called our works isa
for as he doth them in us mat
cor
cor
and worketh in us both to will and do them they are truly his and as we work them in and by that power he gives may yet not in such sense as what we do of our selves be called our own phil

yea if we speak of what good works christ did in that person only in which he appeared at ierusalem while we witnesse not the same done by him in our selves we cannot call those works ours to justification more truly then papists can who beleive as well as protestants what he there did though they never look to do the like quae non fecimus ipsi non ea nostra voco

what he did in that person and not ovrs is his only yet and not ovrs but if we speak of what we do not only in our own persons but our own wills power and wisdom abstract from him and the leadings of his light and spirit say quae sic fecimus ipsi haec ego nostra voco these call truly and only ovrs and so doth the scripture rom
phil

and as for what ovr persons do in his light according to his will in the true movings of his spirit and by no other but his own power quae nos fecimus ipsi sic ea nostra voco these being partly ours though principally his have a liberty from the lord truly enough to denominate by that name of ovrs yet as tis fit he should have the perheminence as to the name who is not the cheif actor but the only author of them rather chuse mostly to call them his though done in and by us and so again

quae nos fecimus ipsi vix ea nostra voco

so there are
good work which are only christs and not ovrs and and by these he deservedly stood justified in the sight of god in his own person which if he had not done and had he sinned he could not have done he could never have bin a high priest able to justify others or sufficient to save to the uttermost such as come to god by him for such a high priest it became us to have who is holy harmless undefiled and seperate from sinners himself or else he could never seperate sin from us heb

again their are good works so called which are only ovrs and not christs and such are all the best that we work without him of our selves even all our own righteousnesse and righteousnesses which are as an unclean thing as a rag isa
as dung and losse and not gain nor any way profitable to save or deliver isa
phil

and by these though done in mans willings and runnings in a way of outward conformity to the letter of the law shall no flesh ever be justified any more then paul was for these are not christs all whose works are meritorious and acceptable to god and deserving no condemnation that know of and consequently deserving iustification before god but mans own righteousnesse as that of the iewes was rom
and pauls was till he came to the light though for want of coming to the light t.d in his dark minde saith paul had no righteousnesse that was not christs
is meritorious of no more acceptance then cains sacrifice had which was iustly and deservedly rejected because its the evill doer still that does that good which god what ere the sinner calls it accounteth evill


again there are good works which in different respects are called truly enough both christs and ovrs viz ovrs as done in and by our persons christs as done only by his power in us and by these last call them as ye will christs as done by him in ovr persons or ovrs as done by us in his power is the justification of all that ever were or shall be justified both deserved and effected and not by what he did without them in that single person that once liv'd and dyed at ierusalem while the same righteousnesse was and is not by that same power of his fulfilled within themselves and so st detesting all that as rotten rags thats done by meer man without christ and disowning it utterly as giving no influence to mans justification both honouring and duly owning all that righteousnesse that was wrought by christ without man as perfect pretious glorious acceptable to god unspeakably usefull to us and truly meritorious at least to his own justification that he might become as he could not a meet mediatour for man this and last own only as the meritorious and perfectly effectual cause of mans justification and howbeit t.d is so blind as to deny our satisfaction by that righteousnesse whereof christ is the author
and to beleive that he that holds justification by this righteousnesse of christ thats wrought in the saints by his spirit cannot be saved
for he owns this sentence there for truth viz that any man that holds that principle of being justified by a righteousnesse within us living and dying that principle cannot be saved
yet not only say but see so much and hope

as great a malefactor as t.d
makes me for it to make any save such as seeing will not see to see the same that he cannot be saved who holds it not but looks for salvation in that gospel which t.d preaches of a iustification by a christ onely without him and that he may fill up his floutings at it and compleat his cursing of it in the same phrase he scfingly renders my speaking this truth in at the dispute
say again to all people that gospel which t.d and his fellows preach of salvation by christ without them without the revelation of christ and his righteousness within them will not bring men to heaven
indeed people it will not
and this is that am to have the second talking with t.d about before come again to i.o viz this point of iustification whether it which we say is by christs righteousness and good works alone and not any thing that is done by us simply as of our selves be by the righteousness of christ without us onely as t.d saith it is or by that which he performs in us also by the power as we affirm it

in the prosecution of which matter which way soever the cause should seem to go in the consciences of such as are considerate yet to the eye of every ordinary observer of him t.ds weaknesses and absurdities are so gross and obvious that he that runs may them sundry of which shall give the reader a taste of as go along that he may know how to relish him in the rest
hear then ye deaf look and see ye blind believers and admirers of t.d and his applauded pamphlet how he to turn his own terms to
upon himself interferes and cuts one leg against another and is not sensible of it and how he contradicts and confounds himself and that so closely cunningly and curiously that neither himself nor any of those who look like himself without their eyes can see it though to all others confess tis easie to be or rather hard not to be discern'd
tells the world that the terms of the question were whether good works mark be the meritorious cause of iustification
and that this was expresly affirmed bylus and saith t.d
this being so gross popsh howard one of the qua present at the dispute hath witness nath
barry since denied that they did so affirm
rep by the way let me tell thee reader as from howard that though he denied that we affirm'd iustification by our good works which assertion the priests falsly us with yet notwithstanding bearing false witness against him he did not deny that we affirm iustification by good works neither is he or any of us ashamed to at this present that iustification is by works but mark this quoth t.d is gross and popish

so then you have t.ds sence on one hand thus viz its not onely rank popery to affirm ovr good works though by ovrs if ever the qu affirm it they mean christs good works in us cal'd ovrs isa
and not meerly our own but also gross and to affirm good works to be deserving iustification wot not well what works they are by which t.d looks to be justified seeing he denies it to be by good for cannot believe him as bad as he is to be so bad yet as to believe any to be justified by bad evil or wicked works though he blushes not to say that

under the guilt of such bad works as adultery and murder david was and so other saints
but yet no wicked ones may be justified and in another
that the gospel gives live upon imperfect obedience which though he do no wickedness is at best but an evil work nor wor well where a man shall scape t.ds censure of being popish unless he run away from resting and relying on christ as well as on himself for iustification for even christs best works are no more than good as tis true that all ovr best that are not done by him in us are worse then naught

but were it so in truth but trow it is not as t.d sayes that to affirm good works meritorious of iustification is so gross and popish that they have reason to be asham'd that own it heu quam turpe est doctori cum culpar edarguit ipsum how much more reason then any other hath t.d to be ashamed of his shameful doings qui alterum incusat probri de ipsum se intueri oportet who condemns others as gross and popish for the doctrine which he himself holds out in terminis and yet creeps from under that condemnation slides his own neck out of that collar and dum cum illis haret luto condemns not himself as guilty of the same defilement but rather to god and all men commends himself as clear and clean

for whoever heard t.d say of himself as he sayes of the qua they are am gross and popish in affirming that good works deserve iustification yet that he affirms the same as well as the qua whose affirmation of it to the contradicting of himself he denies need do no more in proof thereof then send the reader to
of his own
paper out of which every puny may fully prove it to himself for there in answer to my argument a which was to this effect without that term of ovr in such a sense as the papists use it viz evilworks are the meritorious cause of our condemnation therefore good works are the meritoris cause of our or iustification among several frivolous conceits upon which he denies the consequences of my argument t.d replyes thus granting the rule of contraries will allow so to argue viz
evil works which are the violation of the law deserve danmation ergo good works which are the fulfilling of the law deserve salvation and we know no good works such but christs in all which he hath said no more than the which in substance is uttered and intended by our selves for we both speak of and mean no other good works when we say good works deserve iustification then such as are christs and the fulfilling of the law in himself and in us by his power whose works onely are good and all whose works are so good that the law is fulfilled by them and so not condemnation but iustification still deserved for where no condemnation is deserved as it is not by any good works there or iustification is for by every work the law is either fulfilled or broken but by neither every nor by any work that's truly good as every one of christs are whether done in his own or by him in our persons or by us in him his power and spirit is the law transgrest violated or broken therefore by every good work obeyed kept fulfilled and by every work either condemnation or is deserved but condemnation is not by any truly good work therefore is deserved by every good work taliter and by all and onely good works by which is fulfilled the royal law iam
which works

no ill at all to another totaliter yet t.d judges us unjustly as popish who hold no otherwise then thus and himself in holding the same to whom therefore say to say no more of his in saying of good works that they do and yet do not deserve justification si in me iniqius es iudex t.d condemnabo ego crimine if t.d were as just as tis sure he is unjust in condemning us for popery he is so much the more unjust in that he condemns not himself for the same since he that judges us so for so holding holds the same the more justly is he to be condemned by all for not condemning himself as popish together with us

and now whereas t.d supposes he hath added much to the alteration of the state of the question as we hold it and to the enervating of the force of the consequence of my popish argument as he calls it by that weak short and imperfect reply he gave to it at the dispute and that more long then strong addition of many impertinent passages in his accountative repetition of it shall here take them a little briefly under consideration and likewise the rest of that refusely stuff which is replyed by t.d up and down in his book to my self r.h and g.w about this point of iustification and such as were touch't on as pertaining to it that being rid of the rudeness and reasonlessess of t.ds
religion which i.o in his piece of interests not himself in so far as find any where unless in
where his words seem to sent of such a justification in sin as t.d dreams of may trouble i.o no more with the talk thereof when begin again to talk with him

to my contrarioram contraria est ratio t.d thou replyest thus
there is not par ratio

for the merit of good and evil works and that they are not contraries because our evil works are perfectly evil but our good works thou are but good yea isa
all our righteousnesses not our unrighteousnesses onely are as filthy rags

rep
to this as followes viz
if by that ovr good works thou intendest no other then those of your own which ye call good when thou sayest of them that they are but imperfectly good yield to it as truth indeed that your good works and your evil works are not absolute contraries one to another but rather both alike of one and the same sort stamp and general kind that is to say both of them evil works for your evil works being by your own confession evil your good works as ye stile them for good they are not while done by the that hates the light being by confession but imperfectly good and for so far from being truly good that what ever they are in your own in gods account they are no better then evil they are really evil too as to the nature done in though not as to their realy evil as the other and not your unrighteousnes onely but also your own righteousness being by the like true concession but filthy rags they are not absolute but as your best good and worst evil is for as two evil spirits may be both devils though not devils both of one hair but one a little t'other respectively somewhat whiter then the other so your two sorts of works whereof ye call one good the other evil one your righteousness t'other unrighteousness are both alike evil and wickedness though one carries a fairer face before it than the other
neither did as thou

dost pag that the gospel gives life upon imperfect obedience then affirm and so g.w tells thee
of his reply to thee who either didst or would'st not it seems understand me so well as he others that imperfect works and the righteousness which is as filthy rags do deserve iustification neither did ever nor shall now go about to prove by the rule of contraries a contrary desert of your unrighteousness or evil works and of such righteousness and good works as yours are which both you and acknowledge are but imperfect and so no better then evil unrighteousness and filthy rags so as to conclude from thence that as your evil merits damnation so your good merits iustification nay in stead of arguing about these from est of there's consequence
must say rather par est similium similis consequentia things that are alike are of a like desert therefore your evil and your good in name differing yet in kind agreeing being evil and filthy rags both alike do both alike as truely deserve condemnation from him as they are both alike before the lord

but if by that term ovr good of which thou they are but good thou intendest those of own in and by us and all his saints of which he the authour though we in and under him the actours thereof said before vix ea nostra voco deny any of these to be as thou callest them but imperfectly good and both affirm and shall prove them all to be really good and as so truly contrary to both your confessed evil and but conceited good works which yet really are but evil and not onely so but perfectly good also and in that respect more absolutely contrary to all your own both worst and best the best of which though cal'd by you at least imperfectly are yet at best no better in kind then as perfectly evil as the other saving the baldness of that phrase perfectly evil which yet being thy own thou maist the better and must however bear it from me
in proof of which though it seem but a mad mans mad divinity to you more mad divines and possibly a meer paradox to many more then meer parish priests yet let it be considered

that every thing that can be truly according to god not after the manner of erring men onely said to be good or righteousness though so but in part yet is as perfectly so as it is truly said so to be for howbeit all that which is but in part is by our academical rabbies who count all plain countrey but rusticks in comparison of themselves counted but imperfect and commonly so called as if in and imperfect were ever synonomous and all one so that in their benighted minds they oft render that place cor
as till he was corrected did at the dispute thus viz when that which is perfect is come then that which is imperfect whereas that which is in part and but aliqualiter not yet aequaliter or so perfect as the other is is opposed to that which is more perfect to its degree only yet as to its nature which different degrees do never alter for that gradus non variant naturam rei is received for truth by all that which is truly good righteousness light uprightness holiness truth though but some part of that fuller measure that once shall be yet is not onely really the same but as perfectly the same in suo genere

as that which is perfect in degree also is in its kind that is to say as perfectly good as perfectly righteousns as good righteousness light grace uprightness holiness truth is in the highest measure
every of grace is perfectly grace every degree of true good perfectly good every grain of holiness perfectly holiness as every spark of fire is perfectly fire and perfect fire and every drop of water perfect water as well as the whole ocean as every babe as to the nature is perfectly a man and a perfect man as he is that is a man in stature holiness in the least measure of it is the gift of god and know no imperfect gift that he giveth who is the giver of every good and gift and every one of whose gifts is perfect all that is perfect is of god and all that is perfect which is of god from whom no imperfect thing can come and all true good and holiness is of god and all sin unholiness unrighteousness imperfection is of the devil and all that is imperfect whic his of the devil from whom no thing that's good or truly perfect can come and all sin is properly nothing but undefined span alphabet transgression defect and imperfection it self and whoever sinneth is born of the devil and he that is of the while so is not born of god nor in a state of salvation nor in the election but in the reprobation and rejection and what is born of god in that state sinneth not and he that sinneth not is not in a state of condemnation for he doth righteousness and he that doth righteousness is righteous as god is righteous as he is holy pure at he is pure and perfect as he whose child he is is perfect and is as so not in the alienation reprobation and rejection but in the love acceptation or iustification

and whereas our divines talk as if that only were perfect to which nothing can be added thats a false ignorant and blind assertion for as there is a perfection such is that of god which admits of no addition so there is a true perfection that is without any sin corruption which is capable of addition to which more maybe added and such is that of man who may be truly said to be perfect and not imperfect yet to grow on to a fuller measure and stature of that divine nature grace and holynesse which was perfect and not imperfect before though not so perfect but that a greater degree in it may be attained as he that thrives in iniquity which is defect and imperfection becomes thereby more and more imperfect adam in innocency was perfect and so perfect in righteousnesse that he had no unrighteousnesse or imperfection and though not without as christ was not who never sinned yet clean from all transgression yet not so perfect as to be utterly uncapable of any addition to that glory he then stood in

and christ iesus was a perfect child of god from the womb as to the divine nature he was born in yet grew in stature and was one who did no evill in whom was no sin nor was any guile found in him nor was he in a damnable condition and that gift of the grace and wisdome of god that was in him was perfect grace and wisdome and the least degree of grace that any saint hath is perfect grace a perfect and not an imperfect gift of god according to the rule and measure of which as every one walketh he is so far perfect though but a babe and yet saints may grow therein from babes in nature to young men in stature which of young men though it is not the highest stature in the church here on earth yet obtains to so much

strength as to overcome the wicked one and from thence to be old men of full growth and age more intimately acquainted with god the father and to the unity of the knowledge of the son of god the very measure of the stature of the fulnesse of christ himselfe and therefore thy saying t.d that babes and young men are imperfect
as do not and that true grace is imperfect and true obedience and good works are imperfectly good and sin and evill perfectly evill and such like is such a as shewes thy selfe to be yet so imperfect as no babe in christ is in thy understanding of the things of god and such a saying as hath nothing in it if may without absurdity tune it back to thee in thy own imperfect tone but perfect imperfection flat falshood deep darknesse and meere confusion

so that all true good is perfectly good and all thats really evill is properly evill all true light of what kind soever in the least degree is in its kind perfectly light and all darknesse properly darknesse and all thats properly and truly term'd righteousnesse in the meanest measure is as perfectly righteousnesse as all kind of unrighteousnesse and as all sin is really the transgression of a law for theres no transgression where is no law and the least transgression of the law in the least part is really or properly sin so every act of true obedience to the light or law is though but in part and not so perfect a conformity yet truly and properly and perfectly to it and not a violation of it and such a perfect act of obedience as is not only not disobedience but so absolutely contrary to an act of disobedience as that it deserves not the reward of an of act disobedience which is condemnation but consequently the contrary which is which can amount to no less then acceptation or which is much at one iustification from all guilt for theres none contracted and salvation from that wrath which is to come and which comes upon none for any obedience but on all the children of disobedience only
thus every thing but sin and imperfection is perfectly what it is truly and works are not truly good however falsly so cal'd that are not perfectly good and what work is truly good is perfectly good
and of this sore are all the works of christs working by his spirit in our persons viz as truly and perfectly good in genere if not gradu as those he wrought in the same spirit and power in his own who never yet did any work that is evill or but imperfectly good yea as truly an perfectly good as both the worst and the best that you do without him are really and properly evill and consequenly being contrary to your evill works which merit condemnation meritorious of that contrary reward of acceptation or justification

and no lesse then this last dost thou t.d to the contradicting thy selfe in thy other sayings confesse to us thy selfe in these words evill works which are the violation of the law deserve damnation ergo good works which are the fulfilling the law deserve salvation and as thou saift so say we we know no good works such but christs and say know no works of christ that not such and that deserve nor salvation whether those that were wrought by him in that single person which was crucified ierusalem or those that are wrought by him in his saints though thou seem'st to thy self to be so wise whose folly therefore is the more manifest to all men as

to know a christ and as to know some operations and good works and righteousnesse of that christ wrought by him alone in his saints and by them received from him and whereof christ himselfe is the author which thou art so far from owning any justification by and from esteeming so highly of as they deserve that as to any such gain as iustification deserved for us or derived to us thereby thou disclaimst them utterly as meere dung and losse and filthy rags and absit blasphemia doom'st them down to hell as deserving no better then your wickednesses and your own miscal'd righteousnesses do the merit of which is neither more nor lesse then condemnation and all this he that is minded to trace thee
in thy meandrous talkings to and fro in and out where thou dancest the hay up and down in the clouds of contradiction and confusion cannot chuse but take notice of unlesse he be so blind as that his eyes can see no farther then his nose reaches

for mark
thou fasly chargest us with the guilt of that sin of the iewes rom
viz making our own righteousnesse our justification

thou relatest g.w clearing us ofthat saying that we do not make our own righteousnesse our justification but the righteousness of god is that we testifie being made manifest in us according to the scripture phil

not our own righteousnesse wich is the law that is any personal conformity to the law in that outward letter that we can make by any ability of ours without the power of christ such was that of the iews and pauls establishing to himself as his gain and righteousnesse before his conversion to that of christs for that and no other is it which paul calls his own and the iewes own and not that which christ wrought in him cloth'd him with and enabled him to perform as thou blasphemously bolt'st it out but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousnesse which is of god by faith to which though thou seem'st to assent in these words viz the apostle by his own righteousnesse understands personall conformity to the law and by christ righteousnesse that which is of christ made his by faith by which terme his if thou intendest his as abstract from christ his weak strivings in his own strength to keep the law and not that personall conformity to it he was at last enabled to by the spirit and power of christ intimated rom
thou fallest in with us who make that genuine distinction between all meere mans righteousnesse and all that righteousnesse that is of christ

but now as if thine eyes were grown too dimme to discern that distinction thou blindly blendest these two together again into own putting no difference at all between good works or meer mans righteousnesse which in his own will wisdom strength and vain imagination he works beside the light and out of christ and those good works or that righteousnesse which is of god alone which by the pure power and spirit of christ is wrought in and by them and which they by him are enabled to perform which is specifically one and the very same with that in christ himselfe from whom it is of god through the faith of christ made theirs or made over to them that is not meerly and imaginarily as the priesthood prates accounted and imputed but really and truly derived and imparted to them and revealed as its said to be rom
from faith to faith in the light of the gospel to them that beleive therein so that of the fulnesse of that

righteousness of god that dwels in him they all receive grace for grace to the true washing iustification sanctification and salvation of them from all that unrighteousnesse by which they became guilty before god while they stood in no other righteousnesse but their own
yea that righteousnesse of christ in his saints which is in kind the selfe same with that in himselfe thou both denyest to avail one iot to justification and also confoundest into one and the self same with that of meer mans own working which from god is for ever to be confounded

witnesse thy own words who saift thus t.d
deny justification by christ within us we deny our justification by that righteousnesse in us whereof christ is the author two things are indeed meant by the name of christ his person and his operations in us and deny the latter but assert the former for our righteousnesse to justification
rep oh gro's horrid hideous and fordid are not the righteousness and the operations of christ in his saints the same that were in his own flesh are they not of the same with validity and desert being his own still whether done in himselfe or in us and as truly and perfectly good being done by christ who can work nothing but that which is truly good and perfect whether in his saints or himselfe and suppose every title of thy tattle were true that thou telst us
viz that those works that merit must not be due and his good works who owes none though who that is that owes none to god and from whom to god none are due know not and whether it became not christ to be holy harmlesse undefiled separate from sinners whether he ought not in all things to be like his brethren i'le not stand here to dispute but to heb to determine and yet whether all that he doth in what person so ere he doth it in doth not merit need not prove to a man for he will not put me to it

but say suppose it to be all true that his good works who owes none and from whom none are due and is an infinite person do as truly deserve non condemnation and his works from whom only good works are due as from a finite creature to an infinite creator do truly deserve damnation the desert of the obedience of the one arising from the dignity of the subject by which its performed as the desert of the others disobedience from the dignity of the object against which it it is committed yet what makes all this to the mending of thy muddy matter who wouldst make christ himselfe and his good works and operations of righteousnesse in his saints of no such moment as to merit or effect their justification before god is not christ the subject by which though the saints who are his body flesh bones are the subject in which those works of his are perform'd them as well as the subject by which those were done that were done in his naturall body in the dayes of his fleshly being here on earth yea is not he the subject in which also those in his saints are performed while what ere he doth by them he doth in them what they do by him they do in him the person subject being the same is not the dignity of the doer as deserving when he does good or obeys the will of god in one age place person as well as when in another does what righteousness he works in and by his or destroy the merit thereof body more then that which he wrought in and by that body which was the head and

and is not christ iesus who is known to be in all them that are not reprobates cor
and who is the same yesterday to day and forever heb
as infinite a person now and as infinite in all his operations as ever and are not his operations as good and his righteousness which thou for want of his wisdom being ignorant that god calls it an everlasting righteousness i.e that which is infinite or without end
dan
callest but finite
and yet in thy wonted way of infinite also saying we cannot contain an infinite righteousness in us and the righteousness which god works in us is but finite so making either two righteousnesses of god whose righteousness is but one or else distinguishing that one into two sorts finite and infinite which is but one in kind viz infinite and everlasting though dwelling in different degrees in god christ and the saints but well maist thou do this whilest thou makest so many christs as thou didst at the dispute and hast done since in thy crooked account thereof say is not that everlasting righteousness of his working in the saints and bringing near to them isa
as everlasting as infinite as of old and of as infinite value every where as it is any where in that body of his whereof he is the head as in that person which was the head of his body yet t.d denies it to be of any worth to justifie and affirms it to be but mans own righteousness which is dung loss and rags procuring no more to him by desert then his wickedness which merits no more then condemnation and in further evidence of this let thy own words
and
be well considered and compared where thou sayest thus


do you think that the righteousness which the apostle calls his own phil

was not christs had he any righteousness which he had not received and yet that righteousness which was in the apostl never was in christ as the subject but was wrought in him by christ as an efficient cause and christ had an inherent righteousness in respect of which he was said to know no sin and to be a lamb without spot or are not here then two righteousnesses and they serve for two different ends the one for our justification the other for our sanctification the one gives us a right to the inheritance of the saints in light the other makes us meet for possession
and all our righteousnesses not our unrighteousnesses onely are as filthy rags
rep oh rare and base what and and whimseyes and gimcracks are here compound all this deep of t.ds together
some of which but not all for other some the blackest of his brethren believe will blush at is that which others store themselves with by stealth out of the common of theology which few divines dare stir a foot from and here is such a manifest mess of medly such a heap of as scarce ever crept out so openly upon the stage before since the world which should be christs school was by its disputers and schollers made their against christ and his disciples
shall segregate the absurdities of this absolute parcel in which else they may by unseen being jumbled together among some undeniable truths and set them down in their own colours to the view of all


mark reader how divides the righteousness of christ inherent in himself and imparted from him to his saints which who is not so that every single object seems double to him cannot but say and see is one and the self same into two righteousnesses one of which though he confesses they are both christs and wrought by him alone as the efficient was notwithstanding as he sayes never in christ as the subject at all


how these two points hang together as well as things can do that are all to pieces viz that paul had no righteousness which was not christs and which he had not received from christ and yet that which he received from christ christ never had in himself nor was it ever inherent in him which if it doth not contradict the school which no skil'd scholler disowns of nil dat id quod in se prius non habet vel formaliter vel virtualiter saltem eminenter nothing can give infuse or derive that to another which it first hath not in it self and which resides not in it self as the subject wherein the same one way or other is or formally or vertually inherent which i'le not spend time here so nicely or exactly to examine yet am sure it expresly and egregiously disagrees with those undeniable testimonies of the scripture which faith not onely iohn
a man can receive nothing that is of god grace righteousness except it be given him from above but also that in christ are bid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge that in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily col
that the spirit of grace a manifestation of which is given to every man to profit withal according to the measure of the gift of christ who taketh of his own glory grace and giveth to his saints distributing to everyone severally as he will is by the father given first to him not by measure that his disciples may also as they do of that fulness which dwells first in him receive of the same in some measure grace for grace john
and
and this stops that whereby wots he winds himself out
where he saith christs righteousness in the saints was never formally existent in him as the spirits are in the brain for as the spirits are in the brain and communicated thence to other parts of the body so the graces of the spirit are all in christ the head and communicated to all the members of his body as truly and formally as the typical ointment that was poured on aarons head was communicated from thence to his beard and ran down to the skirts of his clothing


note well how that very righteousness which was wrought in the apostle after his convertion by christ and received from christ and so by ds own confession was christs is by first divided off from that righteousness which was inherent in christ though it be christs as well as the other and indeed as undivided from it as christ who is indivisible is within himself and set apart and aloof from it as quite another us if it were scarce any kin to that that dwelt in christ the head and not onely so but secondly pacht and packt up into one with pauls own righteousness which he gloried in before his convertion for what paul calls his own was that he had of old and had left and lost too as dung and loss as much as he once thought it gain before ere he received any from christ and disgraced and digraded so far below it self and its own true

worth and dignity as to be ranks with pauls own yea to be made and counted on as no other but his own the self same as he and the wicked iewes as t.d sayes
who were as ignorant as our priests are of gods righteousness went about to establish to their iustification he makes that righteousness those good works which by christ we are enabled to perform no other then our own good works our own righteousness all which as well as our unrighteousness t.d beckons but as filthy rags nay no better nor any other then that which paul calls his own which own of his he having once counted it gain he had now suffer'd the loss of and counted but loss and dung that he might be clothed with christs which doctrine of t.d if it were true but god forbid that any should take it from him for truth for its most abominably false yet let's see at least what use of information were to be drawn from it and in a word its this


that the righteousness of christs own working in his saints and that which the saints received by faith from iesus christ and that fulness of it that dwells in him is but meer mans righteousness which he must utterly suffer the loss of and count on not as gain at any hand but as loss and dung before he can know christ or receive or be clothed with the righteousness which is through the faith of christ the righteosness which is of god by faith in him and
that the foresaid righteousness of christ which he works in us and we by fath receive from him is but our own and is no better even all of it then our unrighteousnesses are that is as filthy rags before the lord he that readeth this let him understand it if he can annd receive it for truth if he dare but if he do not let him know that t.d hath done his best ill will to the truth that he can to reach it to all men for no less then truth however though such folly falshood not to say blasphemy it is that worse scarce ever fell from the pen of a professed preacher


one observation more which is scarce fit to be noted to any other use or purpose but to the noting of t.d to be such a notable as is deservedly nigro carbone notandus arises from t.ds discourse about the two righteousnesses of christ one of which he calls mans own and filthy rags as if paul when a pharisee had no righteousness of his own that he stiled and dung but that which was christs and which he had received from christ which what a loud tale it is he is not much versed in the truth that cannot tell and that is in such wise as followeth viz whereas t.d tells ut of two different ends of the'e two righteousnesses of christ as he doth also
the one whereof i.e that which is inherent in christ serves quoth eto justifie us and give us a right as a cause of our title of the inheritance of the saints in light the other i.e the righteousness wrought in us by christ which paul calls and dung and imperfect and filthy rags to sanctifie us and to make us meet for the possession of heaven without which heaven would not be a place or state of nor we fit to enter into such a glorious holy place and inheritance among saints in light which of these two give us right to enter as the cause of our title shall shew plainly by and by saying onely at present against t.d as tis said
rev
that us doing gods commandments by the power of christ as they are given out to us in the light that gives us

right as well as makes us fit to enter as well ius ad regnum as aptitudinem regnandi but from ds doctrine who teaches that the righteousness wrought in us by christ which he also calls ovrs and dung and filthy rags serves to sanctify us and make us fit and meet to enter into heaven its but meet here least meet not so fair an opportunity for it an on to observe thus much to ds shame that if his doctrine were as true as it is false that the righteousness of christ in us which yet though wrought in us by him and received by faith from him is but meerly our own according to and no gain but loss dung and filthy rags doth though not enright and entitle us to heaven yet at least wash purifie sanctifie and make us meet and fit to enter into it so that without being purged cleansed sanctified and fitted by or covered and clothed with the foresaid dung and filthy rags we can in no wife be clean or fit enough to enter into that pure and holy place into which no dung nor nor unclean thing nor ought that defileth can enter nor say whoever worketh such abomination or maketh such a lye as doth who danceth the rounds in this rotten doctrine of his till a man can easily find neither head nor tail in it nor truth nor unity with it self nor sense nor reason if he look on it in gross as it lyes together in the whole corrupted mass and unleavened lump scarcely from one end of it into the other yet thus it is know all ye saints that are devoted to dance in the dark to the tune of t.ds loud trumpetings against the truth viz that unless ye be clothed with the royal robes of that righteousness which is inhaerent in christ person only which is as they also say as far off you as heaven is from the earth so that ye can't have it but by that romish faith which is crede quod habes habes believe onely that ye have it and ye have it sure enough though sure enough ye have it not you can have no iustification no right nor true title to enter into heaven and unless ye put on and be clothed with the dung and filthy rags so partly expressly partly implicitly calls it of that righteousness of your own as he terms it which is received from christ nevertheless and wrought in you by him if ye can believe ye are not meet in any wife to enter into heaven but albeit ye have a real true right to enter being though still in your sins already justified by the former yet ye may not enter for all that real right ye have so to do into so holy an habitation for want of being cleansed sanctified and made meet for it by this latter
so of the things that hath spoken ye have the summe

and so come to some fuller examination of the way by which as a meritorious cause our iustification comes and our right and title to enter into the heavenly inheritance and our meetness and fitness for the possession of it also
and first shall shew what these matters come not by


none of all this comes by any or all those good works or righteousnesses which abstract from christ as the worker of them in and by man are most truly and properly mans own for howbeit t.d charges us as crying up our own works of righteousness not onely as our sanctification but as de iure deserving iustification also or acceptance in gods fight and entrance into his kingdom yet but that his eye is so busie abroad

that its utterly blinded from the sight of how tis at home he might see us perfectly clear and himself onely deeply guilty in part yea wholly of the self same errour for verily we say of all our own good works done by us out of him and not by him in us which onely are usually by god and undefined span alphabet also properly term'd our own they are as man himself in the fall who does them is altogether become unprofitable either to iustifie sanctifie save entitle to or fit us for gods kingdom yea what god himself doth isa
we do and will declare of our own righteousness that it cannot profit us of our companies we are gone to and congregatings with them in our own wills and thoughts these cannot deliver us the wind will take all these away and as it hath done some already so will all those that truth therein we say as eph

guilt nor accept the filthy in his filth say according to his mercy he hath saved us by the washing mark of regeneration and the renewing of the holy spirit which he hath shed on us abundantly by iesus christ our saviour to this end mark that we being justified by his grace viz shed on us freely by christ not inhaerent in him onely as the subject might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life this and not thine t.d is the faithful word and these are the truths about our iustification or salvation that they of old were enjoined stedfastly to teach that those that believed in god might be careful to maintain good works of this sort as useful good and profitable unto men counting all their own which yet t.d sayes are necessary to sanctifie and make meet as dung loss imperfect impertinent unprofitable and useless as filthy rags

yea finally as paul said of his own worships works righteousness and services while he was a proud puft up pharisee as most of our formal scribes and modern ministers are for he calls not that his own as t.d does but christs which he was after clothed in and by faith had received from him and by him was enabled to perform and abound in

so say the qua of theirs and of mine if any man think he hath whereof to glory in the of wisdom outward performances inward workings of the mind in earnest imaginations and of mans will in zealous hastings willings runnings strivings after god and righteousness and good in which yet the kingdom comes not nor the righteousness of it could say more then am here minded to do but since came in the light to feel the circumcision of the heart to the lord by himself not made by the hands of man and to witness the worth of the true worship of god in spirit and truth in the inner part which his own witness within onely leads to what good works of mine once counted gain am now made by christ to count loss for those of christ yea for the excellency of the true knowledge of christ to be my lord whom once so called but did not all that he said for whom have lost all that and what more he hath yet called me to suffer the loss of and do esteem all but as dung that may win and be found in him not clothed with the old righteousness of my own which was once pauls and called by me and t.d both but as filthy rags so know no righteousness of christ is called by any besides t.d but with that righteousness which is by faith in his light in which onely he is known revealed and received from him and in the way of that faith by which god purifies the heart which overcomes the world in it and works by that love that fulfils the law in working no ill to the neighbour wrought in me by him even that righteousness which through faith in the light is of god not as our devising diviners both devise and divine to the making of the wicked ones seem just and good before god when they are nothing less imputed but to the true making of them really just and good who before were wicked

imparted without difference to every one that truly believeth in him

so that do not as t.d sayes we do with the iews that submitted not themselves to gods righteousnesse by faith in the light which if they had done they would have left and lost their own go about to establish our own righteousnesse to justification

neither do cry up our own righteousnesse so high as t.d does who calls meerly mans own christs righteousnesse received from and wrought in man by him

neither do cry down christs righteousnesse in some measure to man infused from that fulnesse of the same that beyond measure dwels in christ as t.d does so as with him to term these any otherwise then the spirit it selfe is pleased so to do to our encouragement in obeying isa
our own for vix ea nostra voco

much lesse having st depressed and thrust them down far below themselves under that diminitive denomination of ovr own even those own of mans which the iews ignorant of gods went to establish which were iniquity and abomination in gods eyes and which paul calls dung and losse dare be so blindly bold so t.d is after he hath as undervaluingly as untruly term'd them our own as with him to vilisy them yet further under that title of works but imperfectly good but imperfect obedience and that more beastly and term which none that dwell in heaven can give as in effect t.d does to the works of christ of filthy rags


least of all or at least last of all dare venture so far as t.d does who yet thinks we make too much of our own good works obedience righteousnesse and too little of christs who having drawn these two righteousnesses and obediences viz that of christs and mans which are as far distant from each other as heaven and earth so neere together as to make but one of them which he calls mans own and yet christs and christs and yet but mans own yields whether meer mans or christs to be as paul cald his but dung and losse and as t.d calls all ours but imperfect and rotten rags after all this concludes that such a meer chimera and non entity as this of his own making which hath a being no where but in his own and is not so much as but rather ens irrational tatis is available to sanctifie and make meet for heaven for deny that any righteousnesse that is no better then dung and filthy rag is available at all as a cause of either justification or sanctification of right to or fitnesse for the saints inheritance and howbeit eternally exalt every undefined span alphabet of christs obedience every grain of that good he works who works no evill and every dram of his righteousness in him else or us to be and accepted of god and entitling to and fitting for fellowship with god and the saints in light yet as for that bipartite pipald puppet and meerly imagined imp of t.d.'s dressing out in what should call it christs righteous robes of mans rotten rags deny either merit or meetnesse to come by that meer none knows what for if it be christs own indeed or ever came from him as good righteousnesse obedience done or perform'd by him though in us cannot be imperfect dung and filthy rags and immeritorious but deservg and serving according to the measure of it in us both to justify and sanctifie

and as well to give right to as to fit for the kingdom the desert of every degree of his obedience arising from the dignity of his person that performes it
but if it be meer mans own as t.d saves pauls dung and losse was though wrought by christ and received from him then its but dung and losse as paul call'd his and to speake in t.d.'s
bald phrase but imperfectly good and imperfect obedience and as truly filthy rags as both truly and properly t.d calls all ours but then neither meriting nor so much as making meet for the heavenly inheritance and yet whether t.d doth not in effect say it doth though he unsay it again for to gainsay himself is as ordinary as it is to say at all wellnigh with him let it be considered by comparing his own sayings

t.d do you think quoth t.d
that righteousnesse which paul calls his own was not christs had be any righteousnesse which he had not receved that righteousness which was in the apostle never was in christ as the subject but was wrought in him by christ
rep might reply yea that righteousnesse paul calls his own and calls dung and losse also and had lost for christ was not christs nor received from nor wrought in him by christ and he that makes pauls own which was dung and losse and christs which is all gainfull to man and not dung but most savoury to god both one as t.d does
will once rue it that ever he wrote so over honourably and transcendently of mans and so dishonourably and disdainfully without more distinction of it from mans of the everlasting righteousnesse of christ and the living god
but yet to do t.d so much pleasure as to convince him of his confusion and incomparable contradiction to himselfe though every one shall not have it so from me let it passe by way of false supposition that pauls own righteousnesse he reckons on as dung and losse though once he thought it gain and christs now received by him and since the losse of pauls own wrought in him which yet was indeed that true godlynesse which paul elsewhere calls great gain and profitable to all things mark having the promise of this life and that to come so entaild to it that it can entitle all that live in it thereunto be all one as t.d will needs have it what serves this imperfect drossy dunghilly worse then nothing righteousnesse of pharasaicall paul to alias by t.d most duncically called christs what advantage is to man by this meer loss oh much every way quoth t.d for though it serves not for our justification nor to give us right as a cause of our title to the saints inheritance for that righteousnesse that dwels in christ alone no neerer to us in readity but imaginarily only then heaven is where he sits serves only and only serves for that yet the robes alias filthy rags of it secundum te t.d that reach down to cloath us here that we may be adorn'd as like him as filthy rags can make us like to one in pure robes these serve to make us suitable to such a glorious presence and meet for such an holy inheritance


ipse dixit
but dare not descend after t.d so deeply into these shallow depths of satan so as to condescend to it as truth but must needs condemn it as delusion and deceit for none of pauls meer own righteousnesse no dung and losse no imperfectly good works nor imperfect obedience nor such as that of the iews establishing nor any nor all our righteousnesses which t.d

and together with our unrighteousnesse dare denominate no otherwise then as filthy rags doth so much as fit for that pure possession neithe can such as this entitle as a cause thereunto yea if the righteousnesse of christ within us wrought by him and received from him were indeed no better then t.d makes it who makes it no better then mans own should then acknowledge the who'e sentence to be true which t.d once utterd and acknowledges the truth of
which seeing he intends it of that true righteousnesse of christ in his saints which we testifie to that its not that which paul calls his own and dung but christs own indeed who is the only author of it is somewhat more then a meer lye and little lesse then blasphemy as t.d affirms it viz that any man that holds that principle of being justified by a righteousnesse within us living and dying in that principle be saved

but indeed christs righteousnesse within us only is that by which souls can be saved as shall shew anon for that without which is in kind the same never iustifies makes just righteous holy cleane nor saves from the sin till some of the same be in us every measure of the gift of which though but a part of the whole is as perfect as the st fruit and the meer earnest of the spirit is a perfect gift and as perfectly good in its kind according to its as the whole lump and fulnesse out of which it is given and is that which is by t.d though but a part but improperly called imperfectly good and imperfect obedience
for no obedience nor good thats of christ gift of the heavenly father in him is any other in nature then they both are perfect as they are and as the fulnesse of good that dwels in and flows from them is perfect without any imperfection and tis only perfect obedience as only that of christ whether in the head or in the of his body is not any mans own upon or for which the gospell gives life and justification yet oh the rounds that t.d runs in which theres no way out of but by the dore that is the light which all and robbers are climbing above t.d tells us another untrue tale
which overturns that untrue tale he told before for
he said no salvation is of any by a righteousnesse within for any that it must come that way for whats within us though from and wrought by christ is but good
and rags but
he sayes the gospell gives life mark upon obedience

so according to t.d who sometimes rejects all righteousnesse within us as imperfect as refuse and as uselesse as filthy rags which are good for sometimes again allowes that which paul calls his own and dung to be called christs and good for viz though not to justifie and entitle as a cause or that upon which which term upon though would in of his pamphlet shuffle into a more moderate sense then its properly taken in which is as much as to say for as the cause of he therein doth but more manifest his folly to all men the gospell gives the inheritance of life yet at least to sanctify and make meet for
but then this righteousnesse within whether christs or our own which is dung and christs also by gift to him must take heed however of creeping too high for if it aspire so as to assume to it selfe to be own'd us advantagious to justifie and entitle as that upon which the life is given it must be down

again to hell for t.d
do all them to damnation by whole below all possibility of salvation that dare so much as hold that principle of being saved by it but for fear his damnation should be damned again as too damnable a doctrine if he should not moderate it as to the legall rigidity thereof seeing he sayes the law gives life upon perfect obedience and not without it and can't beleive any obedience that christ can work in his saints in this life can be perfect but all that he here works within men imperfect and none perfect but that he wrought without them as far off as ierusalem as long as
years since and hath now inherent in himself no neerer to them then heaven is to the earth he bethinks himselfe or else forgets himself again so far its not matter which as to cut off the entail of eternall life which the law gives upon no other then absolutely perfect obedience and the promise of it under the gospell whether christs or ours or both know not which and think he knows not well himselfe unto an imperfect obedience as that upon which mark life is given under the gospell and contrary to christ who tells us math

that the gospell righteousnesse which reaches to the thoughts must exceed and be more perfect if more perfect can be but more then perfect cannot be then that of the pharisees whereof paul was one that as to the righteousnesse of the law was blamelesse yet came not neer that of the gospel there's in no case any entrance into the kingdome t.d sayes
the law gives not life without perfect obedience the gospell gives it upon imperfect obedience thus posito uno absurdo sequuntur error minimus in principio fit major in maximus in fine
when our men call'd ministers erre by one absurdity rather then return they multiply it into a
and rather loose themselves in the laborinth of their own learned thoughts then learn of christ and stoop to the simplicity and plainnesse of the truth as it is in iesus for but that they love that smoother and smoake of the pit rev
they came out of in aperto et facili posita est salus the grace of god which brings the salvation appeares to all men teaching such as are willing to learn at it to deny ungodlynesse and worldly lusts and to live godly righteously and in this present world which life they hope not to live till the world to come where unlesse the pope be a truth and their own true doctrine when they say as the tree so it lyes be a lye tis too late to begin it

and in such a wood and wooden wheele as to and fro in and out up and down round about here and there no way out doth t.d wander about this matter of our justification by the righteousnes good works and obedience of christ within his saints one while saying one thing of it anon another sometimes that its christs own wrought by him received from him sometimes their own even that own of theirs which is imperfect dung losse and rags which was theirs long before ere they knew him sometimes in another sense then that the spirit calls them both their own and his own also somtimes this sometimes that now that it serves for nothing being but imperfectly good unlesse filthy rags be good for anything then that as very losse and dung as paul counted his own that it serves him for something viz to fit for heaven but not to enright to it as the same in himselfe and so its tantum but not quantum now that its no lesse then losse of life

to expect life upon it then that as imperfect as it is the gospell gives life upon so it somtimes this and sometimes that sometimes himself well know not what thus that single double righteousnesse whereof man is the actor but whether himselfe or christ the author is scarce distinctly determined by t.d heating about in the tossing cock of t.d.'s brain advanced one while up to the highest heaven and by and by again to the depths of hell like men in a ship that are whiffled up and down in a troubled sea which the wicked who are never well in their wits nor soundly stablish in the truth are ever like to of whom one may say with the

iamjam tacturos sydera sumna putes iamjam tacturos ta ta putes

and with the prophet pal
they mount up to the heavens they go down again into the depths they to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and their wits end

never did read or see in so small a piece of work so many ringles and rounds as t.d makes and runs in except i.o's
who in many things makes whether so many or more cannot yet say but am sure many as plain round o's and cris crosses to himselfe as most men can likely do it that set not themselves to it in so little a compass as his is contained in since began to dive into the bottomlesse pit of that thing call'd divinity or discern the shallow divinations of the so deemed deep divines

having hewed my way to it throw those craggy contradictions of t.d to himselfe about it and dispersed and vanquisht some of the dark vapours wherewith he had vailed that question that lyes between us shall now vent my verdit on it in a more plain open view and having negatively declared whose righteousnesse and good works justification and life is not given upon and discarded all those of meer mans own as losse rags imperfect and what ever t.d falsly charges on us as affirming it or affirms himselfe of life given upon imperfect obedience and meetnesse to inherit it by pauls own which he renounced of no worth to give any influence into these matters shall shew whom and whose good works and righteousnesse life comes by and is given upon yea here positively affirm that by none but christ alone iustification unto life can come nor is there either title to the inheritance or fitnesse to possesse it by any other good works or righteousnesse save those of the lord iesus only whose only and all whose works even in the very least degree thereof when or whereever wrought are perfectly good when the best of meet mans are as t.d sayes but imperfectly good which is as much as to say things every truly good thing being properly perfect and every perfect thing properly good and every imperfect thing properly evil and every evil imperfect or rather defect and imperfection it self and every perfect thing good for somthing and every imperfect

perfect thing without gods wisdome who orders sin to his own glory and is easily able to bring good out of evill being properly per se good for nothing

yea this stone of israel gen
christ which was ever set at nought by you builders who seem to your selves so much to build upon him but are seen more then any to build beside him and stumble at him is now again become the head in the corner act

neither is there salvation in any other nor any other name under heaven given among men whereby they must be saved then that of the lord our righteousnesse who is not here in this world simply so accounted as tis simplicer satis accounted on by our and then made to us of god wisdome righteousnesse sanctification redemption hereafter in the world to come but so ready made to us here and that perfectly too so far as he is perfectly trusted to and in pet

for salvation salvation from god to such as expect not more the pardon and forgivenesse of what is past then from and power to forgo all sin and all unrighteousness in due time to come who have the witness within themselves of all iniquity to be as they waite on him so truly done away and remited as though they meet with temptation as christ did which is not transgression if withstood not to be done nor at all committed any more ioh

psal
and this peculiar priviledge and high prerogative hath he who is the head and hath as he is well worthy in all things the preheminence over his body which he is the saviour of purchased to himselfe by his free humiliation and to death even the death of the grosse to be in perfect power to save to the uttermost all that shall ever come unto god by him
now much if not most of this is in general granted and assented to by all viz that iustification to life and salvation is by none but christ and by no other righteousnesse but that which is most and properly called his and not mans but still the question about which lis est viz what christ it is for t.d makes two at least if not more viz a christ within and a christ without and what righteousnesse of christ it is for t.d makes two righteousnesses of christ also viz one within us and another in him without us by whom and upon which the title to iustification and the inheritance comes

and to this answer that as know no other person nor thing that gives us title to salvation then christ and his righteousnesse so know no other christ then that one which the scripture speakes of that dyed at ierusalem and was crucified in the great city spiritually called sodom and egypt and was an immaculate lamb slain by the beast from the foundation of the world by whose blood his saints ever were and still are redeemed and cleansed from all their sins and by the eating and drinking whose flesh and blood they have life in themselves whom they also as paul and others did witnesse speaking living working labouring in them comming into them as they open to him supping with them manifesting himselfe to them as they keep his commandements when not to the world that break them making his abode with them dwelling in them by faith walking in them as they in him formed in them being in them that are in the faith and not reprobate as concerning the faith as some are who dream they have it the hope of glory even

christ iesus the son of god the seed of abraham according to the flesh risen from the dead and alive for ever the second man the lord from heaven the quickning spirit that shewed himselfe to his disciples comming in where they were the dores being shut appearing to them in what fm he would vanishing out of their sight at what time he pleased christ the wisdome of god the power of god the word of god the righteousnesse of god the sanctification and salvation of god the image of god the true vine of the branches the dore of the sheep the light of the world and by his light in them the judge and condemnation of all that hate it and perfect saviour of all that come to god by him and to him in it the same that ever he was yesterday to day and for ever the selfe same and not another no changling but numerically the same to them that see him as the does not who are commenting on him but cannot comprehend him guessing at but cannot him naming themselves after him but are no kin to him not divided but individually one not one without us and a different thing in us as t.d dictates two things are called christ his person and his operations in us
but one without us and that same one in us seen to be but one and the same without them and one and the same in them by the single eye of them that are being joyned to him cor
one and the same spirit in him though two christs to the doubleey that never yet saw clearly any true christ for he that imagines any more then one christ knowes not aright that one that is but what ere he thinks unlesse it be some false ones in truth hath truly just none at all

and as own no other christ but that one by whom life comes to all that beleive in his light so own the life to come by that one christ not as us but as comming within us and contrarily to t.d at the dispute who as he truly relates it to his own fuller shame
being asked by g.w whether we are not iustified by christ with in us answered no but by christ without us which christ to make but one of him still whom t.d by his metonymy metamorphosyes into two things expressed by that one name his person and operations as without or while without and not come into them is no more to them who when he comes in them are his saints then he is to all them who are without him in the world whose condemnation he is by his light because they yet beleive not in it that he in whom is life whose life is the light of men by it might come into them and make them partakers of the life ioh

but as he comes in and men behold he now cometh undefined span alphabet in myriads of his holy ones
jud to convince all the ungodly of their ungodly deeds and the hard speeches that ungodly sinners have spoken against him so is he made not only their sanctification to cleanse and make them meet for the pure lord to look upon with delight as vessels of honour sitted for him to take pleasure in but also even so and no otherwise then so as within and bringing forth his own image and righteousnesse within them is he their righteousnesse to justification so as to enright and entitle them to the gracious acceptance in the sight of the lord which by his own holy presence and holy spirit and holy operations in them he hath fitted them for
and as by him else not as without us but us within us by that obedience and those good works of righteousness both active and

passive of himselfe not as without us only as is blindly beleived by our blind guides and their beleivers but as within us wrought and performed doth he really become our righteousnesse to the iustification of us in gods sight and an entitler of us to the inheritance and a sanctifier and sitter of us for it and also we the righteousnesse of god in him for though whatever he did and endured without in that body that liv'd and dyed at ierusalem was as truly of perfect obedience as to the ends in order to which it was yeilded being the fulfilling of the law and of all the types shadows and sacrifices that went before him and that whereby he left us an example that should follow his steps yet if the blood of that immaculate lamb and the suffering and the sacrifice of himselfe by which he purges away sin and that righteousnesse and those perfect good works and holy spirituall operations of his be not witnessed neerer to us in time and place then
years since at ierusalem viz within us now as ioh
it avails us not to our salvation

and howbeit this true transposition of purifying before pardoning of mens forgoing sin by christs power in them before gods forgiving and forgetting it runs in a clear crosse line to your undefined span alphabet of the cart before the horse who set iustification from the guilt before sanctification from the filth of sin expecting and accounting among your selves without the lord while he is silent and before the bill of your accounts be brought in by him ye are iust and pure and holy and good in the sight of god when its nothing lesse upon the account of somewhat done by another that never knew the workers of iniquity so well as to entitle them to an entrance into gods bosome in their iniquities as if all scores were quitted between god and you and your sins blotted out yeares at least before they were by you done and by his witnesse in you as with a pen of iron and point of a diamond written down by christ and the works of his spirit within yet absolutely assert that ye can be no further justified then in such measure as ye are sanctified before god nor yet any sooner in order of either time or nature as you speak
am not ignorant of your ordinary school distinctions positions namely that bona opera non praecedunt justificandum sed sequuntur justificatum dant non us ad regnum but only aptitudinem
that good works go not before in the person that is to be iustified but follow only in persons already justified and give no right to the kingdom but only a fitness for entrance into it to such as have actuall right before ever they do any good by the power of christ and t.d by implicit faith treads in the same common beat'n track telling us
that surely the leading of the spirit or sanctification is a fruit and effect and not a meritorious cause of not being obliged to the penalty of the law yet all this is but tittle of those whom christ and righteousnesse serves to talk and make a trade on tell not me t.d of thomas of io duns the scot and other scepticks schoolmen and casuists that make religion a matter of dispute more then practice for say and yet no more then what the scripture proves to any but such as take more care by their innumerable distinctions senses and meanings upon it to defend themselves in their sins then to live the life of it that the good works that are the gift of christ and the fruits of the spirit of christ in us and that righteousnesse which is of his working in us who worketh in us both to will

and do what are we do that is of worth before god are those by which our salvation is wrought out phil

and are not the fruit and effect of but go before iustification from guilt and acquiting from the penalty and condemning power of the law which is the fruit and effect of the other and the same that gives the aptitude and meetness for the kingdom the self same righteousness of christ within us wrought and imparted to us gives to us the ius or right to inherit it and not another without us onely imputed for as is commonly said quae supra nos and so may it be truly said in this matter quae extra nos nihil ad nos what good works and rigteousness of christ are done by him without us what ever they are intentionally and conditionally yet are actually and absolutely nothing to us but as we come to see and feel the same by that same power that wrought in him working mightily in us performed within our selves

neither are the good works and righteousness of christ which are the fruits of his spirits leading us thereto subsequent as effects of his not being under the lawes curse in a person before justified as t.d and the scholastick doctors of whom he learns it indoctrinates but are praecedent as causes of it in persons in order to their peace with god and iustification in both gods sight and in mens and in their own for as tis said isa
of the inhaerent righteousness that resides and remains in the hearts of saints which is the fruit and effect of the spirit of god making them of a wilderness a fruitful field by the pourings out of the spirit upon them from on high so it is in truth that the work of that righteousness is the peace and the effect or fruit of that righteousnes is quietness and assurance for ever yea that people who of a barren forrest become a fruitful field to the lord bring forth fruits of righteousness by christ in them to the praise of god are they onely that when the nail of gods wrath indignation and torment comes down by right on the fruitless forrest have even eaten us or thereupon a due right and title to the dwelling in the peaceable habitation and sure dwelling and quiet of the fathers love and abrahams as well as a fitness for it which fitness and meetness is first and ever goes before the actual and immediate right there to come for whatever remote and conditional right all men have to the iustification life and peace of god in christ mediante fide iustitia sanctitare
on terms of that precedent faith righteousness godliness and holiness wrought in them by christ which makes them for it yet a positive and immediate right thereto can no man have till he be thus made to enter it any more then he that was unmeet for the marriage supper for want of his wedding garment who had as true a rem
right as any that were there conditionally he had fitted i.e clothed himself accordingly had in his old suit the rotten rags of his own righteousness and not christs a real and immediate right to intrude himself into so holy a presence who was with shame thrust forth forth for his labour
and whereas our unjust iusticiaries strike hard against us as they think with that true story rom
of iacob and esau being the one loved other yet being neither good nor evil

rep
say and so would they too if they could once sea that

one thing to be denominated aforehand by god who how it will be oft calls those things that yet are not as if they were loved and respectively before or good or evil be actually done or the doors born with reference to the good and evil he would be done in time and another to be and actually and hated not onely without any reference or respect to good and evil that it would be done but also before the subject and doers thereof are in rerum natura as yet in so much as any actual being


that those two persons were types of the two seeds that and not persons but so as they are the children of one or t'other are the only absolute unchangeable everlasting subjects of gods peremptory in alterable and eternal decrees of election and reprobation viz the seed of the woman and that of the serpent which the seed of the righteous who are ever blessed and the seed of who are never to be renowned are respectively born of and adhaering to


that though they will needs it as spoken of those only yet it is not poken of two persons only but it is spoken of the nations that strove in the womb of rebecca and the two manner of people that were to go forth of her bowels viz israel and edom which two nations also but that what is most right is mostly a riddle to them they might read as born after the flesh were types yet of a more mystical and spiritual israel and edom

then they are yet well acquainted with as neer of kin to esau that is edom as they are in account both in name and nature


that gods loving one and hating t'other of these was as is most evident in the letter mal
not without but with respect to evil and not evil to be done in time for on the account of edoms mountains being the border of as iacobs were not they became the objects of gods hatred and a people against the lord hath indignation for ever

that there was no such thing as iacob have loved esau have hated said of those two single of which our intricate expositors interpret that text before those two children and single pair of twins came out of rebeccaes wombe neither doth that text rom
say so in terminis as our academical arithmeticians usually wrong repeat it for the text sayes that before they had done either good or evil or were either it was said to her the elder shall serve the younger and that's true enough that he did both in the single type and the foresaid double and its witnest in the saints whom the world knows not to be truth at this day that the elder doth serve the younger which was an underling to the elder a great while but of the other its said thus not as it was said unto her but as it is written jacob have loved esau have hated and where and when was this written before the persons of iacob and esau were born or had done either good or evil trow not but if our benighted seers look again they'l see it was written by malachi the last prophet prophecy was not before but after they were born and had done all the good or evil they ever did in the body yea so long after all this was written that the mens bodies both were of years before that both dead and rotten

and to inculcate this a little further let thus much considered that howbeit denyes iustificion and life to be given myself do somewhat more then himself who falsly accuses me of it upon my obedience or good works or righteousness of ours onely and properly so called for as much as all ours as well as our selves as in the fall without christ and his in us are as an unclean thing and and liss and as filthy rags before the lord and as he speaks improperly imperfectly good which is no other then evil as said above or imperfect or to use his own phrase still imperfect obedience which is but disobedience nevertheless the good works righteousness and of christ in us as well as his without us being when but in part or in the least degree perfect and the fulfilling of the law tuliter qualiter and not defective or transgressive of the law for as we have of our selves no other so he hath none such nor are any of his his operations or obediences imperfect or a violation or breaking of the law and either a violating or fulfilling breaking or keeping of it every deed is that is done at all even these are such by which iustification may doth and must come if at all and upon which the gospel gives life

and if any doubts it as himself does or rather denyes the truth of it need go no further for an argument ad hominem then to t.d himself who
sayes the gospel gives life upon imperfect from whose own imperfect speech in that particular may argue and perfectly conclude the truth asserted of the worth weight and vnloar of christs obedience in his saints every part of which is perfect a minori if may be candidly construed in my cauting back to him in his own language of imperfect obedience
thus arg
if the gospel gives life upon imperfect obedience as evrs onely is if any can properly be so called then upon perfect obedience such as at christs within us and without us is much more
but secundum re the gospel gives life upon imperfect obedience therefore upon christs good works holy operations righteousness and obedience in us which is perfect and not imperfect much more

and if shall strive by the serpentine sublety to save his head this way by saying he intends by that term of imperfect obedience not any obedience or righteousness of our own wrought by us without christ but that wihch is as he sayes pauls was his own that he received from christ which own of his paul counted less and dung our own received from and wrought in us by christ yet let him remember at least
that then he calls the gift of righteousness by faith received from god and christ from whom comes every good and perfect gift but not any insufficient defective or imperfect that or any ever read of imperfect
and whereas he may yet twine say that he intends not in such a sence as take the word imperfect in for evil defect insufficiency to its end or so but for onely or a less measure or degree of that fulness every part of which is also in a sense perfect let him
consider what said above viz of no good heavenly spiritual thing or gift that comes down from above from christ and the father of lights that which is but in part is any where no not in cor
or truly can be called imperfect for the earnest and first fruits of the spirit and grace is spirit and grace and good as the whole is that its a part of and

not imperfect but perfect as the other is perfect and so all that's born of god is truly holy as god is holy and perfect as the heavenly father is perfect and sins not as he sins not nor can being of the incorruptible seed for all that sins is of the devil and thereby are manifest the children of god and of the devil that that is of god overcometh the world and that which overcometh the world is not overcome by the world but keepeth himself that the evil one toucheth him not and sinneth not as he doth and doth no other that is begotten to it by the devil and is of the and he that sinneth not doth righteousness and he that doth righteousness is righteous as god is righteous pure as he is and so in some measure perfect though not in the same measure perfect as his heavenly father is perfect that is bearing his perfect image in his and not part of gods and part of the devils as an infant in nature bears the image of a man in stature and not centaure part of a mans image and part of a beasts and not having a mixture of sin with his grace as thou whether more or falsly it matters not sith its both in a great degree supposedst as thou saist meant when in answer to thy question viz
whether be any true believers who are not perfect at the dispute

replyed there are degrees among believers little children young men fathers and these things may serve as my answer to that piece of folly and falshood of thine now am up on't for whatever thou supposest mean suppose and mean no such matter when say perfect for every true believer and sanctified one by christ though but in part is as truly though not totally perfect and perfected as he shall be by him who is said to perfect for ever all such as are so far as they are for ever sanctified by him nor yet but that thy senses are sodden so as to take or rather rake or scrape things for granted to thee before they are so given did or do grant as thou there tatlest persons to be justified who never did fulfil the law personally for though told thee indeed as thou truly tel'st it again to the world there are but two estates iustification and condemdation and now tell thee over again that there is no medium between these for every one stands either iustified or condemned or not guilty before god as his law which is the light is broken or fulfil'd by him and he that stands by the light in his own conscience by which god judges him in any particular cleared or iustified stands before god so far uncondemned how ever judged by man therefore wherein david was clear in himself though clouded with mens false accusations of him he could and did with boldness appeal to god to iudge and reward him in that case still according to the integrity of his heart and innocency of his hands in gods sight and so abimelech and others see psal

but he that by the same light which is no lye in the conscience of ether godly or wicked as t.d little less then perswades men it often is in both
stands condemned within himself and so consequently before god whose witness that in him is let him· flatter himself as he will let t.d and all men sing lullaby and prophecy as smooth things to him as they can so far as in any case or cases he rebels against the light is so far inexcusably till he repents and returns to it in such wise condemned by it in the sight of god whereupon

even david himself where his heart smote him for iniquity regarded in it and he that does it let him dote the contrary if he dare does say assuredly so far regard it could stand in no more boldness and guiltlesness in his sight then adam could after he had fed on the forbidden fruit for which he fled gods face and where he fell short of that uprightness he sometime stood iustified in and by before and fail'd so fowly as that flawes fainirgs and falshood were found in him as if ever there were in all his dayes it was in that unjust matter of and his wife in which yet even while he was guilty thereby most impudently affirms he stood with god not in a condemned but in a justified estate there let lye as he lifts yet david declares when he had done that wickedness in his sight god did not onely speak in wrath and judge him but was worthy to be though himself was justly condemned by it to be justified and cleared in so doing psal

ay though said there were but two states in one of which every man is as he does good which since the fall he cannot do but by the power of christ or evil at the suggestion of the viz iustification or condemnation yet deny any person to be justified in whom the law which can't be by the weakness of the flesh is not by the power and spirit of christ fulfilled neither do imagine as thou imaginest did a mixture of sin with believers grace for though they that drink of the whores cup of abomination and fornication which is full of such kind of trashy doctrines and mixtures and medleys which they ministes and measure out to one another supposing see with such eyes as themselves suppose such a and suppose suppose it too yet neither suppose nor own such mingled messes of doctrine but know that no more then iron is truly mixed or can cleave into one compositum with clay and no more then god and idols light and darkness christ and belial can be mingled into agreement no more mixture is there of the sinners sin which is of the devil with the saint's grace which is of god and so whereas thou thoughtest thou hadst caught me as thou there sayest in a manifest contradiction thou hast but according to thy common custom in that kind caught thy self instead of winding my self out of which contradiction of thy meer coining though thou sayest replyed not but down on the top of a seat like a man astonisht and under the hereticks iudgement yet thou feest have here so well wound my self out of it as to manifest it to all men that were never in it and to leave thee in the lurch under the hereticks iudgement of for thy folly and fictions about it which are hereby also manifest to all for verily if were at all astonished at any of the three dayes disputes thou miserably mistook'st the manner of it it being not at all as the iewes were at the wisdom of christs but as oft as it was at the stupidity of thy understanding and answers

thirdly and lastly from thy foregoing grant to us which is more then we say and would have thee say that the gospel gives life upon imperfect obedience let it be well remembred by thee sith its agreed on all hands that all the obedience that christ yielded to the law in that person called christ without us was perfect and in no wise imperfect that then that imperfect obedience as thou call'st it which the gospel gives life upon

as thou sayest can be no other then that which is inherent in us in ourpersons onely and not his in whom all that is inherent thou darest not on pain of blaspemy deny but that it was perfect and if so then see how with thy wining to and fro and running up and down round about thou hast at last brought thy hogs as they say to a fair even till thou hast drawn the dirt of thy fal'd charge of popery as thou callest that doctrine of life upon our imperfect works which thou threw'st at me who never held it by but christs perfect obedience upon thy own so that if any man enquire who is it that holds that popery of life iustification upon our imperfect obedience tells it that himself is the man in whose book
it is written as legibly to all as if it were branded upon his as his own doctrine that the gospel gives life upon imperfect obedience and if he will take his term of imperfect and translate it better by the term of perfect obedience wrought by christ in his saints i'le give him his word again with all my heart and can afford it for if so he gives me no less then the question it self which is affirmed by us and not denied if so by himself concerning lifes coming upon christs righteousness received from him and wrought by him in us

so then the snare is broken and am escaped which yet is whole enough to hold fast enough who set it who while for whom twas set am set at liberty by himself cannot with all his struggling strain his own neck out of the string whereinto he hath slipt it unawares
sic ves non vohis fertis aratra
further yet much more is to be said in proof of it that our being first led by the spirit of christ into the righteousness of his working in us is antecedent to our iustification as a meritorious cause of it though considering how slenderly slides away from what was at the dispute urged to that purpose even as he sets it down in his own relation of it to his own best advantage there were no great need of more if all wereas wise as some are silly to see the strength of what was urged but some are silly and some are willing rather then to own troublesome truths to wink against it and to seem more silly then they are whereupon when have examined the inefficacy of ds returns to it and turned them home in their native nakedness to the shame of him who sent them out may not unlikely urge somewhat more

to this argument from gal

they who are led of the spirit are not under the law therefore being led of the spirit is a meritorious cause of not being under the law and so consequently of iustification or by it

thou t.d rep'yest that am very silly myself or take my hearers to be so thinking this to be a proof of my former consequence or that there is any consequence in this argument whereas first this argument is urged not so much in proof of my former consequence as entail'd on that but as entire and absolute within it self for as to the proof of the former consequence viz contrariorum contraria est ratio therefore as evil deserve condemnation so good works in proof of which thou sillily sayeth should have pro that there's par
ratio for had prosecuted

that should have proved that there's contraria barro for the merit of the ones and of the other as have told thee above say as to that former consequence it had been sufficiently proved before by telling you but that in such a crowd of conference as ye were in among your selves it could not be heeded that as condemnation and of iustification were contraries so good works which said were not those of our own working without christ for oft said not by works of righteousness we have wrong but what christs works in and by us none of which are imperfect but all truly good and evil works are truly contraries and so of contrary desert the one being all as truly good as the other truly evils and as for thy saying am either silly or take my hers in that think there's any consequence in the argument from gal

say did not take my heedless hearers so silly thus but now take some of them an self for one to be much more silly then did at the dispute not onely by reason of sundry other remarkably silly passages that are in thy printed relation thereof but also in that thou thinkest there is no consequence in that argument for verily wert thou but as solid as thou art silly in this matter or couldst thou but look an inch or two beyond that verse whereon the argument is grounded thou might'st see of thy self that which is of force sufficient to prove the seet for shewing in the verses between the works of the flesh which the spirit leads out of and the fruits and works of the spirit which the spirit leads such into as follow it the apostle adils this viz against such there is no law such works of the spirit as love ioy peace goodness meekness temperance and such persons as are by the spirit led out of the work of the flesh adultery uncleanness laferviousness hatred wrath envyings drunkenness revellings and into the other whence to the proving of the sequel of that argument in which thou sillity sayest there's no no consequence argue

if such as are led by the spirit out of evill into good works are thereupon deservedly not under the law then their being led by the spirit who are led by it from under it is the deserving or meritorius cause of their nor being under the law and so of iustification

but verum prius ergo posterius

the minor which unless thou wilt deny thy principles its like thou wilt deny is thus proved those against whom deservedly there is no law are thereupon deservedly from under the condemning power of it for such is the of the law that who ere deserves the condemnation of it till they come not to deserve it first or last shall assuredly feel it
but there is no law deservedly against such as not after the flesh into evil but after the spirit into good works therefore according to that also rom deservedly no condemnation

for indeed those and no other what ere ye deem to the contrary being deluded by the devil to the deceiving of your own souls are truly in christ iesus then those that are led by the spirit which who is led by is led out of evil for it leads into nothing but good those onely are in the spirit and all the rest in the which follow the flesh in its lustings against the spirit and so under the law and ce thought they

name the name of christ and after him call themselves christians while they are not departed from iniquity much more while they plead for its continuance under the name of their of necessity while they abide in the body yea those and none else are christs though millions more may conceit themselves his so as to be interessed into the blessings of peace life and iustification by him and abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise and sons of god that are led by the spirit of god into good works out of evil to live and walk in the spirit out of the and the thereof out of vain glory envy hypocrisie and all deceit and if any think he is christs or any other men are christs so far as to stand justified before god in him before he be sanctified or while he is guilty of such gross evils as david was defil'd with while he was wallowing in the mire of that matter of vriah as guesses david and all saints are by which name he paints them out as well while they are in such a nasty pickle as when they are wash of impure the righteousness of christ without him to himself or count upon it that god impures it so as to compute him or any righteous holy good upon that mere account of his own so counting en't and confident believing it so to be before he find and feel that by his faith in christs light which such fanciers as i.o and most divines and their disciples are far from faith in while they fight against it as fiction it be revealed and in himself and imported to him to making of him righteous as christ is and to the purifying of him in till he come in facto esse to be pure as christ is pure iohn

they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof upon that cross of the lord jesus then which paul glorified in nothing more as true saints now do while the world is ashamed thereof that is the light by which christ condemns all sin in their flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in them as truly as in himself and they walk no more after the flesh but the spirit by which also paul was crucified to the world and the world also unto him

and now whereas t.d and those divines from whom he must come to be divided before ever he know his part in the undivided christ do uno ore confesse so far unto this truth as to tell it further then they are aware

against their wills while they tell us that the good works and fruits of the spirit and christ righteousness within the saints and the obedience which by him they are enabled to perform are not onely that which makes men meet to enter but are also all the righteous mens evidence for heaven both in faro ecclesia conscientie for know no man among them that sayes any other then thus that no men can know one another nor any men themselves to be christs and heirs of heaven and to have right to enter there and that the faith in christ which they professe whereby they say they stand entitled to the righteousnesse of christ without them is true living saving justifying faith and not fancy dead unprofitable and good for nothing but as it is accompanyed with the other fruits of the spirit and good works which serve they to justifie every one that is justified without them say they in the sight of god in his own sight and conscience and in the sight of men shall take all our doctors at their words so far as they do yield as pharaoh did to by a little and little at once in order to the winding of them in at last whether they will or no to yield us the whole question in every inch of it wherein they stick for we shall not ere we have done leave them so much as a hoof thereof behind and while it is in and upon me say something more to these two grants of good works giving st for entrance evidence of our to the heritance and the truth of that faith which though it never be alone say they yet along gives on our part true to it

as then to the what great difference there is but that they who where they should not make two into one as does pauls own righteousnesse and that of christ in him love as much when they need not to make one into two between the matter of merit and the matter of meetness that our divines can digest it exceeding well to have it said the fruits of the spirit and christs good works and righteousnesse within his saints onely makes them meet to inherit but can't digest it at any hand to have it said that these of christ and his spirit in them do the inheritance or make worthy of it doth not the that makes meet and fit for merit or make worthy of it and enright to it in some and in scripture sense at least the whole course of which tells you not onely as you tell one another often but that you often untell it again when you tell that of necessity men must sin while they live no sinners nor ones of any sort have in any wise any right to inheritance in the kingdome or are either meet or worthy to be any where but without the holy city together as fearfull unbeleiving dogs and abominable in the lake of fire but tells you also verbatim in many places of all their and onely their right and worthynesse to enter who by christs power do the will of god he did and have and work the same righteousnesse that he did in himselfe within themselves thess

thinks he hath half knockt the qua for ever down into their dumps with his deep drawn argument from rom
t.d
if by grace then it is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more of grace otherwise work is no more work whence quoth he
if justification be of works as you assert then grace is excluded from having any hand in our justification which is to the scripture which sayes we are justified by grace
our justification cannot be a debt and a free gift
mean not both in respect of us
and this he calls his irrefragabascripture urged by him that the hearers might be covninc't of the damnablenesse of our doctrine who dare to talk of good works and perfecting holynesse bere as ever we mean to see the face of god hereafter which he and
rumsey call a doctrine of devils and might th and detest us as we deserve and indeed finding his work fail in its force the day before before the fire and the day that declared of what sort it was he prepared this against the dayes dispute as his setting it in the front of his second fight against us· and the truth and to this quoth he nothing was replyed

rep
a good cause why say for there was no room for reply but like as pilate when he had askt christ this question what is truth as soon as he had so said rose up and went his way not staying to take his answer so well remember t.d crouded in the next argument which have answered already above concerning the works the iews went about to establish which argument is so neer a kin to this that one answer may very well for both in both places paul by works and own righteousnesse meaning no other then what are wrought without christ by us and not any that are wrought by christ in us say crouded the one so hard on the back of the other and past so soon from one to the other

that without interrupting of him which he would ve complained on as much on other hand there could be no interposing of an answer and so not expecting it he went his way to another matter without it


yet now as to his argument itself somewhat may be replyed and if considered as in conjunction with its fellow that followes it so close at the heeles
from rom
and beares such a broad shew of backing it it is not so big nor amounting to such a bulky bulwark but that one may easily put them both in a bag if no more be said but this that in both scriptures as also phil

where as inconsistent he opposes his own while a pharisee to that of christ within him when converted and a saint and tit
where he opposes the works· of righteousnesse we have wrought to our being renewed by the holy spirit and makes grace and renewing by the spirit all one as well he might for if we be not renewed by the spirit and saved from the sin then say grace is no more grace for what use is it of to us if we be left in and unpurged from the sin which christ came to save his people from so from the wrath of to come which will come unavoidably on all that are disobedient and unrighteous paul opposes the gift of grace gods righteousnesse to mans meer own works which are not good though so thought by himselfe and mans own literall righteousnesse of the law wrought in mans will and imagination onely out of christ the light and faith in him and the leadings and movings of his spirit and does not oppose grace to the righteousnesse of christ in his saints or sanctification and holinesse that is of god by faith in the light revealed in and received by every one that beleeves as inconsistent for those are not onely concomitant but consistent and concurrent together to justification as grace and our works onely are not for these two do tollere se invicem confesse so that if justification and life be of grace it can't be of our et retro if of our works not of grace but grace and gods righteousesse grace and those good works wrought in us by christ and for the doing of which we receive the grace or gift of ability from christ these are indeed one and the same and so homogeneous or of one kind that they may be synonomous also and bear both to be called mutually by the same name of either grace or good works and so are they throwout the scripture as one thing promiseuously denominated sometimes by the term of grace somtimes the gift of god in christ the gift of righteousnesse holinesse
for all this is grace and free gift and yet its inhaerent in us too as the same that was in christ and being christs as meritorious not onely meet but worthy also in such measure as its received in as it was in a higher measure in himselfe whether it be a gift to do or a gift to beleeve or a gift to suffer as thess

compared with phil

to you given not onely to beleive but also to suffer for his sake and they to whom this gre was given were by god counted worthy of the kingdome for which they suffer'd and so paul who laboured abundantly in preaching the gospell sayes this work was the grace which was given him by christ in him by which grace also he was what ere he was that was worth any thing having nothing but what he had received that made him differ from another by which grace or gift all boasting and glorying in selfe was continually excluded and the glory of all to be given still to god and not flesh man and selfe so that while iudas could blame none but

himselfe for being damned so paul and the rest though they wrought out their own salvation yet could blesse none but god who wrought in them of his good pleasure to work will and for their being saved by his grace cor
cor
eph

phil

so that all along the gift of both faith and good works are both called grace yea grace is no grace yet to salvation from sin while men remain in their sins and unsaved by it and while the grace or gift of gods righteousnesse remaines onely in christ without them save onely that they are in a possibility to be saved and while they yet witnesse not him and it by him within themselves to the destroying of the works and image of the devill which when they do then and not before let them of ace as they will they know the grace of god in christ iesus and then alls grace and by grace and not of works or themselves or any righteousnesse of their own that they can thank for it whatever they work in the light and leadings of it in preaching praying service worship and what ere they have are enjoy act beleive endure or suffer for his name

and so grace and works grace and the righteousnesse of christ within us when mans own which ye yet are onely in and establishing your selves by who hate the light and are out of it is denyed as rags as it is by us do not destruere but ponere se invicem so well stand together in the matter of our justification that indeed neither of them can stand in it without the other
neither is grace at all excluded as injudiciously judges from any hand in iustification by our asserting it to be of works of this nature and establishing this inhaerent righteousnesse of christ in us thereunto but by this alone is grace perfectly ectablished neither are these in opposition each to other as sayes they are as immediate contraryes as mens evill works and these good works of christ in man were by me affirmed to be but rather individually the same and whereas t.d saith our justification cannot be a debt and a free gift both in respect of us to what was said above which might serve to answer this adde my denyall of that position of his with my grounds thereof for howbeit in respect of the same time it cannot be a debt and a free gift too yet in respect of the same with reference to times and seasons it may for as it was nothing but meer mercy to lost man and free grace gift and goodnesse to man on gods part and not any debt or desert from god on part that st engag'd or mov'd god to give his son and to make promises in the gospell to give his free gift of life eternall and to make christ the author of it to all them that obey him and the meer grace of christ to us to come into the world a light and give himselfe a ransom for all and to promise to give life to all that come unto him and to god by him that they might have life and salvation to the utmost yet seeing as may say so god and christ have by free grace that moved them to make it thus put themselves freely into mans debt on terms of their obedience they are man performing the conditions on his part since then in justice bound to perform it and so to the same subject mankind from whom god at st was altogether free and to whom he was rich in mercy and infinitely free in giving christ and making promises he is since on account of his truth engaged if man be not to him selfe to make it good and as it is in the like among men that promise

which pitty meer mercy moves to make piety and equity require its making good so tis here and its no such newes but to such as are novices in the faith to understand that which to the same persons was grace and free gift at st becomming a matter of desert and due debt at last so that though glory be to the grace and mercy of god which onely moved him to say when the wicked turnes from his wickednesse and does what is lawfull and right he shall not dye his iniquity shall not at all be mentioned to him yet the wicked turning gods wayes are not so equall as he pleads they are ezek
against man whose wayes and thoughts are all crooked and unequall if he do not now justify and forgive the reforming evill doer and having in his free favour said it that he that confesseth and forsaketh his siss shall find mercy iohn saith iob
if we now confesse our sins not god is gracious and mercyfull though that be originally the ground of all and to be magnified over all his works and is oft exprest to the wicked repenting as the grand cause of gods remitting
isa
let him forsake his way and thoughts and turn to the lord for he is gracious but saith iohn god is and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so having refuted d's irrefragable argument as he stiles it from that scripture rom
which confesse is irrefragable in truth but that wrests it being one of those unlearned and unstable ones in the truth that peter saith pet

wrest pauls epistles and other scriptures to their own destruction return to proceed in that which went away from by this profitable parenthesis viz to shew how the scripture ascribes the as not onely meet for them that are meet for it but their due de jure that do his commandements
blessed are they that do his commandements that they may have right to eat of the tree of life and to enter throw the gates into the citty but without are dogs
without the citty and without right to it as well as without for it who if they were other
doing the commands they should have both worthynesse and right and jure hereditario by right of heirship according to the promises made in that behalf should both duly and keeping the condition no otherwise then deservedly inherit it as he that having a promise of the inheritance of a citty in case he will adventure to storme and overcome and win it fighting and overcoming accordingly though the promise of it at st on such termes was a gift may then claim it for his inheritance as of debt and desert which it is not onely fit and meet he should have as on terms of promise on anothers part performance of the terms required on his own who ever helpt him in it he is worthy as the right heir one that hath due title to it accordingly to enjoy and inherit and indeed the very word inherit which is so both in the negative where the wicked are excluded as no unrighteous one shall ever inherit and on the positive and promissive hand where the righteous are included as he that overcometh shall inherit all things doth if men were not praepossest with prejudice against the truth and with blind principles which as its harder to knock an old peg out of its hole then to knock a new one in when thats out theres more ado to drive out of them dispossesse them of and draw them from then would be to draw them to own the plain truth if the darkness were once dispeld import no lesse then an entailing the title of the kingdome

to the good works and fruits of the spirit in us which are the termes on which it is promised on any name or thing abstract from these which yet is so absurd as his fellow a in the school of christ are as to make in no wise a cause but onely an effect of our justification and of our standing entitled to it on things without us that are nothing to us abstract from these whereas if that be true as it is in their own schools that quo panitur quo sublato effectus
that upon the being of which the effect ever is upon the not being of which the effect can never must needs be the cause of that effect its most true that the good works and fruits of the spirit in us are not the and effects but the causes of some kind or other of our and as the cause of every sort if it be but causa sine qua non as they speak the cause that gives no influence but only is a meer hangby yet necessarily too as a cipher is in order of nature evermore before the effect so is our sanctification so antecedent to our justification even in the sight of that contrary to our schlmens figments who say justification is st of the two so that god lookes on us as just while unjust before he makes us just say till our sanctification is our being counted holy in gods sight can never possibly be

ob
and though its said he justifieth the ungodly

rep say yea justification is ever of ungodly ones yet never in but from their ungodlinesse as sanctification and is of sinners but not in but ever from their iniquityes he the guilty but by no meanes no not christs blood so exod
as to cleare the guilty while in their sins or hold them guiltlesse as dreames he did david while they are guilty of adultery and murder and while they are taking his name in vain crying lord lord but not doing what he sayes naming his name but not from eniquity he makes christ to such as believe in his light wisdom righteousnesse sanctification and redemption but what ere some count he in no wise counts him so to any any further then he doth so make him he sees no sin in iacob nor in israel but it is because there its done away and remitted not by pardon without purging but so as not to be committed any more or if it be theres new guilt contracted and the sin imputed till again remitted on returning but this israel to whom he is so truly good are them that are of a clean heart psal
he will speak peace unto his people and his saints while they walk in wisdome but let them not return any more to folly for if they do they do they must again hear more rough from him then ever and find him speaking in wrath and in his sore displeasure there is a blessed man to will not impute sin whose iniquityes and transgressions are covered but tis he in whose spirit theres no guile psal
so that marvail what our priests mean by salvation iustification redemption and such like when they say a saint or a sinner what should call their mongrell seed may be in a state of salvation while they are in the guilt and filth of their sins for know but two things christ saves his people from viz from their sins and from the wrath which is to come and know no salvation at all from the wrath which is the effect till there be a salvation from the sin which is the cause of it for posita caus a effectus as well as sublata tollitur and am sure none is there as yet from the sin where men are not onely in it and it in them but singing loath to depart and pleading for

a necessary abode of these themselves and sin together while themselves are abiding in the body
yet t.d so thinks that to stand in sin which is in the reprobation and yet to stand within the lists of gods love and election will stand so well both together that david stood justified in gods sight in that which if men had seen him in he would not have been justified in their sight who love sin more and hate it lesse then god does and yet all this altogether
but t.d thou hast heard of god onely by the hearing of the ear as yet by hearsay from thy self and blinding brethren but when thine eye comes to see him and he comes neer thee to judgment comming who in sin can abide and who in iniquity can stand before him who is as refiners fire to the drosse and fullers sope to the thou shalt for all thy seeming abhor thy selfe before him and repent thy that ever thou talkedst of mens being in a state of justification before him while under the guilt of sin as purer saints then thy selfe have done that have thought the same as thou dost in very dust and ashes and that walking in the fruits of the spirit and holinesse of truth must go before the sight of gods face in peace and that the sinner shall not see his face and live thy selfe shalt see whether thou come to walk holily yea or nay

but alas to what purpose is it to tell our this when they tell in effect the same one to another yet believe not what they say themselves but contradict it out of their own mouths as soon as have done like lards making good plain prints with their feet in the sandy ways they run in yet dashing them all out as the go with their long bushy they say no lesse then that sanctification goes before justification in the sight of god though they see it not while they say which they confesse is a fruit of the spirit the gift of god a part of our sanctification is that that as an instrumentall cause of it goes before as that by which we are and without and before which we cannot be accounted in the sight of god yet by and by again they tell us that justification which is by faith and so not before but after it goes before sanctification whereof faith they say is a part and that the leadings of the spirit and its fruits among which justifying faith is reckoned up as one
gal
and effect of our not under the lawes penalty that is of our justification from the guilt of sin so t.d

sometimes to escape and slip away from the shame of this absurdi and contraction they tell us or at least some of them that iustification of saints or sinners for am to seek still what to call the creatures they call saints for if call them saints it loaths me to call such sinners saints as they term so yea

if they be saints which some so call then guilty sinners are saints al

and if call them that commit sin the servants of sin as christ did iohn
and not saints and children of god they will be ready to loath me say then they tell us that iustification of painted and sinners in the sight of god is without and before faith or any thing else even before sin was or men either from all eternity and from all sins past nor present can't say here because the sinning subjects of this iustification are not yet extant in the world but from all that ever is to come and faith by which the iustification comes is but an instrument whereby the

evidence of this iustification in gods eye comes in to men and manifests it to their eye whereby the sinners themselves know it and as for other fruits of the spirit which are all the fruits of faith too which confess to be the first in being of all work truly good so that without it tis impossible to please god and whatsoever is not of it and in it but out of it and out of the light in which it is if true is but sin these are onely as evidences to us and to others that the faith we have is justifying and true and not dead and fained and fit for nothing

so say they in gods sight we are justified freely from of old without faith or good works that follow and flow from it either this we know and are assured of that faith is to it self as a work in the business of iustification and that faith is imputed to us as being in stead of a perfect personal righteousnese or that tis the meritorious cause of our iustification utterly deny quoth
but faith without works is that by which we are formally justified but the other that is good works that by which we are declaratively justified in pauls sense who rom
sayes we are justified by faith onely without the works of the law a sinner is absolved wot he means in his own conscience for know not when t.d reckons or whether at all god holds an elected saint guilty if not david while he was guilty of adultery and murder in iames sense iam
who sayes by works a man is justified and not by faith onely a is approved quoth t.d
out of diodat whose words he useth which approbation of a believer in his faith as true is both in himself and before men so as they usually say by good works a mans faith is evidenced to himself within and others without to be a true living faith and so consequently his iustification with god to be surely known which was but could not be seen or known to be before
rep
now therefore a word or two to the grant of our antagonists that iustification is before in gods sight but it can't be known to be by us or others nor evidenced to us so that we can stand as justified ones or approved in our own sight and other mens till we be sanctified and have both faith which is a fruit of the spirit and other fruits of the spirit which if true that faith works by as love a pure heart victory over the world temperance peaceableness gentleness and such like

is it so friends that no man can appear to himself to be approved and justified in gods sight nor to himself or others be known that he is so till he comes to believe and do other good works of righteousness which first declare the thing so to be wonder then how ye dare talk and affirm that to be before good works which before good works ye confess cannot be known so to be will ye ever be in your wills thoughts inventions and traditions intruding your selves into that ye have not seen and confess cannot be seen to be as you say it is vainly puft up in your fleshly minds and entring into and venturing to reveal and vent out gods secrets which ye say are secret and hidden to man saying they are so and so before the time you say they are first revealed to you in and telling men they are justified before god and loved before they do any good and bidding them believe this for true doctrine from you that tis so till they come to do good works and that that's the onely evidence whereby you can discern that

thing so to be which yet you say is so before either by you or them it is discerned in his own secret thoughts say you and bosome councels the thing stands so that we are justified but its not revealed to us to be so neither can we know it to be so that we are justified but from the time of our bringing forth fruits of righteousness do not secret things belong to god onely and things that he reveals when he reveals them and not before to you and your children to talk of are ye not like natural bruit beasts in this that you oft speak evil of that truth ye know not and oft tell that for truth which is not so when ye know it not and even confess it cannot be known to be till evidenced by good works and yet you will say tis of a truth before any of those good works by which onely the evidence of it comes to you be brought forth in you

tis true there be many things in esse rea before they be in esse real before they be visible though this iustification of yours before sanctification in gods sight which ye yield is before sanctification but sanctification before it in your own sight and in the sight of all men is not one of those invisible realities but if may so say an apparent real visible non entity rather and fancy of your own brain but what things soever are in truth to us they are not so as that we in truth and of a truth can say so or so they are till the time that we come to see them and that come forth which is the onely evidence which we come to see them by and he that of that thing as being so or so which to him is not yet known so to be is a buisie body whose tongue runs afore his wit his lips before the light that would lead him out of darkness his thoughts not a little and his reason
tum demum apud nos res dicuntur fieri cum incip unt patefieri to us things are onely as they appear so that whoever perks up and prates of what he knows not and of matters that yet to him are not which work which is that of the priests in many things he that shall count him that's in it a wise man shall by my consent be canonized a fool for his labour
iustification in gods sight of a sinner is say the priests before any sanctification is at all in him but neither the sinner can know that there is any such matter as pardon of his sin or that he stands just in gods sight appears not at all to himself not yet is it evident to us who tell him tis so neither can we know it any more then he till sanctification appear in him from which as that which goes before it ever in our eyes we come to the sight it yet if he will believe us who speak of a thing we know not and talk we know not what and if he will take our words for it that his iustification is before he be sanctified who have no other evidence of it our selves or whereby to make it evident to him but this of his sanctification which is evermore that which goes before the other for ought we see or can discern and if he will trust us implicitly at a venture he may but if he will not say he may safely

and as to that speech of thine out of dare say it was not a deo datus concerning good works justifying a man declaratively and serving in iames sence to approve a believe in the sight of men for there's not truth in't if meant so onely and exclusively of their use to iustifie formally and absolve a sinner in the sight of god as it must be if it serve that turn

at all to which thou usest it yea contrarily affirm yet not denying but that they do before men the faith of him that professes to believe in christ to be true and not hypocritical that they also tend as well as that faith they flow from to justifie formally and absolve sinners in the sight of god
and though paul rom
concludes that a man is justified by faith before god without the deeds of the law yet he never concluded as you cloudy expositors of him conclude of his words which ye wrest beside his right to your wrong meanings any such maer as that a man is justified before god without the good works of the gospel between which of christs in his saints and those of the law which are mens own done without christ of themselves ye never distinguishing run so far into confusion as ye do which deeds of the law done in mans own thoughts willings and and not in the light and spirit of christ the power of god never reach the thing that is run after that is the of it without which there is no life for the law requires brick but affords good works but it gives no strength to weak man in the flesh and wherewith to perform the letter onely kills and onely the spirit the life so both paul and iames and we as much as diodate and do for ever shut out them yea and so much more then any of you do we deny the deeds of the law so done as to the doing us any good toward our absolution before god by how much we do both in our life and doctrine establish onely the deeds of the gospel while you who doctrinally exclude the laws deeds do yet practically establish them to your iustification for howbeit in words ye establish faith as that by which ye stand justified formally before god yet that faith ye act who believe god accepts your persons and perfmances without his righteousness inherent in your selves and while ye are yet impurged and not so much as believing you can or must be here purged from your sins is far from the true faith of the gospel being no other then the false faith or true fancy of those who were of moses and the law that trusted in lying words that could not profit them jer

who thought god did them wrong if he justified and accepted them not in their fastings and services though they never fasted from their iniquities nor loosed the bands of wicdedness as if when they had been at their formal humiliations for a day they had procured some dispensation to let hell loose again and were then delivered to do abomination this kind of barren leafy of yours who look for life in it is one of those deeds of theirs who were of the letter and law and not that of them who are of the gospel faith which formally justifies before god which who are of are blessed with faithful abraham

but now as to the faith and other good works of the gospel which all are the works of god himself and christ iesus working them in his saints among which faith in the light is the first from whence others come without which they cannot be any more then it can be true without them and by the name of which faith for as much as all follow it all the rest are denominated in john

nor doth the faith without them any more then they without it both which concur as one thereunto obtain formal iustification in the sight of god
so that there is a doing some and sometimes the same material good which deserves no good nor acceptation but rather evil and reprobation from god being not good formally but evil before him while the same that does material evil also does that good and such was cains sacrifice which was else as good as abels yet had noacceptance by right as the other had because sin lay still at the door and twas not the righteous one but the that did the good and the sinner whom we know god heareth not who had he done as bene as it was that he did and offered it as well as the thing was good had been justified as well as his brother if thou do well laith god shalt thou not be accepted again there is a doing good which deserves no ill nor but onely good and iustification before god being both bonum and factum also materially good and formally well done and that de jure promissi at least to an entrance into the kingdom and such are all the good works done on the gospels account in the faith and power of christ the light and in the leading of the holy spirit whether faith it self or or any other that follow these which are not of our selves but by way of gift and grace from god and strength from christ received by us who are weak in our selves the fulfilling of the righteousness of the law which is all fulfilled in this word thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self for love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore is love the fulfilling of the law gal

t.d does not the apostle oppose faith and works faith is opposed to it self as a work in the business of iustification

pamph

rep faith is neither opposed as thou frivolouily supposest good works to the gospel nor yet to it self as a work in the business of iustification but both it self and all the good works that are done onely in it which together with it are the gift of god to us in christ iesus who is ths authour worker and finisher of them in us are altogether as the one good work or righteousness of god and christ in the gospel by which we stand justified before them opposed to mans meer righteousness and works of the law by which no flesh living can be justified and though paul when he sayes to him that worketh is the not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh

not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted to him for righteousness doth faith and our works the gospel and the law which is not of faith yet when thou lookest with clearer eyes who canst now see with no better then thou hast thou wilt see that he no where opposes grace and gospel good works and the works of christ in us faith and the fruits of the spirit of which faith is one much less as thou faith and it self as a work but all these in one as god and christs single and singular gift of grace to us under the gospel as that one perfect and personal righteousness by which as a cause thereof we are made meet or worthy to be justified in his fight by which works that of faith together with them justifying us as a work as well as an instrument to receive christ and his other operations wrought in us by it all bsting as blind as thou art not to see it is eternally excluded forasmuch as both it and the rest are a gift as well as works given to us by him to for which the glory belongs onely to the giver and not to the receiver at any hand

thou sayest as

pamph the scriptures attribute our iustification to the righteousness of christ in the same sense that they deny it in to works
rep that's true if by the righteousness of christ thou intend the righteousness of his working in us and by works those works of our working without him but utterly false if by his righteousness thou mean what he works without us and by works what works we work onely in him for the scripture attributes our iustification to this latter as to the former it attributes his own of both which he beinh the onely authour not unto us lord not unto us at all but to thy name onely be the who dost not as thy supposed ministers suppose meerly that thou dost but far be it from thee so to do shall not the judge of all the earth do right first count men just that are unjust in this world and not make them so till the world to come but first justifie the ungodly from their ungodliness and make them godly and then countest them to be such as thou hast made them
but awake ye divine diviners and see what a dream you are in who deeming the lord to be no other then like your selves imagine your selves as pure in his as you are in your own eyes though ye are not yet washed from all your filthiness nor yet believe you need be so in this present world whereas he that condemneth the iust and be that justifieth the wicked in his wickedness and crow god is not an abomination to himself both these are an abomination to the lord

and hence is one ground of your so miserable a mistake in that ye take as ye confess your selves iustification in its meer forraign and not in its neer and proper signification viz a counting and not a making of them just who are not so whereas and iustificari is iustum facere and iustum fieri to make and to be made just properly and and then consequently and secondarily to think and to be thought so but you fleeing afar off in this and many more points from proper names into forraign acceptations that ye may be as far as may be from such truths as most torment you will needs in this world at least have the words to justifie and be justified sanctifie and be sanctified to import and found forth no more then improbum justum sanctum putare putari justificare sanctificare ri in no wise to be ex injusto improbo justum sanctum

facere fieri as if in this life god having somewhat else to do could not well have while to make people iust and holy and therefore they being also well contended so to be left did agree to leave them to the liberty of their lusts under some certain toleration to live in them and yet to think them iust and holy in the mean while notwithstanding and then hereafter when men are more willing to it and himself a little better and more at leasure to do it to make them iust and holy by some purgatory in the life to come

but friends have a care however of what you do in this case which is of no less then eternal consequence to your immortal souls for assuredly let paul and iames himself iam

determine it if you will whose sence t.d thinks he hath on his hand yet you will find it so that ye can be no further justified then ye are sanctified in the sight of either god or men that are after the heart of god yea if a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him can it profit him is it not dead yea knowest thou not vain that as the body without the spirit is dead and can do nothing so faith without works is dead also is it not made perfect by works was not abraham and others justified by works see ye not then that by works a man is justified and not by faith onely yea quoth t.d approved by men but not absolved and accepted of god by works
rep then let paul speak rom
the kingdom of god is righteousness peace and ioy in the holy spirit he that in these things seereth christ is acceptable to god thereupon surely as well as approved of men
though therefore ye dream pleasantly while ye are awake and bless your selves saying aha am warm have seen the fire in the letter where ye read by the halves singling out of it what best suits with and serves your sinful desires and leaving out what serves to the crossing of your carnal lust and corrupt affections you have been flashily and more shalowly then solidly read of a declaration of a righteousness and good works of another even christ whereby onely men can possibly come to be saved never heeding at all that this righteousness of that other is to be wrought in the saints by him who wrought it first in his own person before ever they can be justified by it and their salvation truely wrought out by it which we confess is to be wrought out by it alone and not by any that's meerly mans own yet when ye come to see what a meer painted paradice ye have been led into by that false flash of your justifying faith without works concurrent which is but the fruit of your affectionate fancy which would fain have it so that you might be saved by christ and yet serve your selves you'l find that you and your whissling faith have in all this been but as fa going before and ignoramus fa following after

though say these things are in truth the sum and substance of your sayings the very image proportion lively pourtraiture of your dead faith which ye count living and saving and justifying and what not yet as the lord lives youl find it dead even thou i.o.t.d and your fellowes as well as we have done who were as high in that supposed saving faith but reall fancy as your selves and your selves utterly undone before the lord for all that when he comes to enter into judgement with you as he hath with his own house the qua where the iudgement in these dayes hath begun therefor be ye warned who seem to sit warm by this your fantastical faith and imaginary painted fire for whatever ye think and how ever ye blesse and flatter your selves with hopes of true and blessednesse in this way wherein ye erre not knowing the scriptures which are true but that ye understand them not nor yet the power of the wrath of god yet this is but your own righteousnesse all this while though reall as in christ yet of your own faining to your selves as yours and yet not your own neither so as that ye shall ever be saved by it till ye come to put it on and be cloathed with it in your own persons its but a fire of your own composing with wood and hey and stubble and sticks and straws that crackles in your conceits like that of thorns under a pot that will soon flap down and not last longer then such flashy fuell as your fancies seed it with its not the joy of the righteous which the strangers intermedle not with which burns sure and sollidly and the more when cold water is thrown upon it

yea from the lord god say to you all as twas said of old to such as trusted in the name of the lord without his ture behold all you that kindle a fire and compasse your selves about with sparks walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks which ye have kindled but this shall you have at last from the hand of the lord ye shall ly down in sorrow

and though in your pleasant trance you sweetly sleep it our every one within your tents as in a pavillion and snort it our every one to another that your iniquityes are hid and your sins who declare your sin as sodom and hide it not are covered and the lord impares them not though ye are far from them in whose hearts there is no guide as if ye were those hidden ones of god that he himselfe sees no sin in because its by christs blood really and not imaginarily washt away and though you canonize your selves into the compellation of the saints while in your sins and then sooth up and comfort one another under that title with smooth words yet

as a dream of a night vision wherein an hungry and thirsty man dreameth he eateth and drinketh but behold he awaketh and is empty and faint and his soul hath apptite so shall all the maltitude of those meer and be yea as in a dream when one awaketh so when the lord awakes to visit you dreamers he will assuredly despise your image psal
yet sowes soft pillowes under the armholes of his fellow least they should under the unsupportable burden of their wounded spirits when the light begins to shew them to themselves and judgement to take hold on them and their own sins to slave them in the face saying that a man once justified cannot become unjustified again in the sight of god and what the saints do he heeds it not so as to mention it to the saints and would have the saint by all meanes not be so senselesse as not to hold the sense of his present interest in gods favour and pure presence though at present under the same sins which god behold as paule iniquity in another but as petty infir onely in him because he taketh pleasure in his sinning witness david who quoth t.d when he was guilty mark of adultery and murder was not in a condemmed state but in a justified estate in proof of which have said more sayes t.d to r.h then this man or any of his brethren can answer in vindication whereof also when was urged and proved against him that david was then and long after condemned in his own conscience psal

and therefore could not stand justified before god who is greater then our hearts and must if they do much more condemn us iohn
replyes most unanswerably indeed to what one might expect from one that sayes no qua can answer what he sayes all this which is
it does not appeare to me that david was at this time mark unjustified in his own conscience but the contrary i.e justified for he spoke those words psal

that thou be justified when thou speakest and cleare when thou judgest after nathan had come to him and told him that the lord had put away his sin

rep
which coming of nathan t.d was then told but that he was so absurd as not to heare and hereby in told again was after the childe was born and not while the adultery and murder was commited which words

of nathan the lord hath put away thy sin being spoken not till david had confest to him that he had sinned against the lord which was not till many months after his vile sinning do evidently evince it to any thats not wilfully blind that for many months his sin was not put away but remained on the file and that the lord did not hold him guiltlesse nor the light in his own conscience neither till he had truly repented from his sins

yet least any poor saint like sinfull soul should sink down while he lyes in the sordid sink thereof under sin the sense of the losse of his interest in gods love since he is so deriled that he may easily suppose himselfe to stink in the in his sight
t.d who hath not one in all his apothecaries shop for ought find to save the soul of a saint from sinning hath another antidote at hand whereby to strengthen the hands and save the soul of the sinning saint from sinking so low as to beleeve god loves or likes him ere the lesse when he has done yea he is never without his cordialls and pills to purg the head and heart from all sense of judgement that that evill day may be put a far off and the saints he past feeling of wrath when they sin and so be more secure in commission of it but pills to purge from the sin it selfe he is so far from vending that by his good will he would have none of them licensed to be vented by the qua in the country where he hath to do or if any course be taken to purge men throwly by calling them to perfect holynesse in this life he takes to contrary a course to keep the men unpurg'd as to mount against those as against some cheating mounte banks as delivering no better then the doctrine of devils and to make men beleeve that are such infidells in christ as to give credit to t.d that tis not possible to attain to such a purging as this in the body no not by the very herb of grace it self
his antidote to preserve the saints from too deep a sense of their sins is this whereas the qua tell them that if the light in their own consciences accuse and condemn them from the face of god for sinning theres no god nor christ that holds them guiltlesse sith that of god within is his witnesse and vicegerent that what it sayes and judges in them is as the voice of god himselfe and if that create trouble man cannot create solid peace

tush quoth t.d for to the same purpose he talkes though not in totidem verbis
what tell you us of conscience conscience is often erroneous and not rightly guided in the very saint
talk of conscience to the wicked its office is to be a witnesse against them for their sins which if it do not check them but tell them god loves justifies and accepts them when they sin its defiled tit
and leads them into a wrong opinion of their estates in that it testifies that their estate is good when its nothing lesse for to the impure is nothing pure but unto the pure all things are pure and when the saints sin and are defiled thereby the office of conscience as a witnesse in them if it do its office is to cleare and comfort and speak peace and if it offer to trouble them when they fall throw infirmity into fowl enormity and dare be so bold as to darken their evidence of gods love and of their justification in his sight when they are guilty as david was once of things not fit to be named among saints yet dare be so bold as to say it is defiled in the saints and testifies falshood to them also in saying that their estate is bad when for all their sins it is good no

lesse then it tells lyes to the wicked that their estate is good when its nothing lesse

thus we have the unconquerable and that uncontrolable comfort which administers to the saints when they become sinners and fall into the same folly and filth with other wicked men who is very a boanerges or son of thunder as he is in a few slight words more the same solid power with peter and iohn to the wicked yet to the saints of his own coyning is he another barrabas or son of consolation mean not another of the same with him who confirmed the saints in their goodnesse and grace but another of another kind that comforts confirmes and chears up his sinfull saints in their sins and dawbs them over who are dirty enough already if such he saints as he sayes are with his own more dirty doings who would have them live as justified in gods sight and as uncondemned in themselves as saints whilst ore head and eares in their sins

but will all this hold t.d little did once think ever to have seen such a dish of doctrine drawn by a divine from tit


though unto the pure all things are pure was wont the same way to be wrested by the ranters and for my own part had been minded to look for such a piece of libertinisme as he would learn men from thence as am far from it knowing that in maxima libertate theres minima licentia yet should sooner have lookt for a needle in a bottle of hey as they say then have lookt for the like from thence or have scrap't in that scripture to find it if t.d had not told me it had been there where yet for all his telling me of a justification of a saint in his sins cannot yet find or see such a thing nor any else beleeve but such as are as blind as himselfe for the light in the conscience of both good and bad doth tell them infallibly what they are and testifie to the face of the best man in the world that god doth not justifie him while he sins which witnesse of god within their own hearts is greater then the witnesse of man and will have audience at last when it begins to speake out when such a one as may easily be slighted who witnesse onely for god from it and therefore shall say but little more to this matter neverthelesse when t.d and his justified ones come once to feel it stand upon its feet which like an innocent just lamb hath been hitherto slain by the beast within them because it torments them with telling too much truth great fear will then fall on such as see it and have made merry over it in its captivity and at the same time there will be a great earthquake and lightnings and voices and terrible thunderings and great hail out of heaven the plague whereof shall be exceeding great every stone perhaps about the weight of a talent rev ii

three or four more of d.'s in comparison of what we might expect from him in satisfaction most unanswerable answers to such arguments as were urged by us in proof of iustification by the spirit of life and grace of christ in us and by his fulfilling the law in us throw the condemnation of sin both in and cleare out of our flesh and by our walking not after the flesh but after the spirit as a cause that gives right and title to it shall speak a little to and then dismisse t.d as to this point till meet him again in other matters about which he joyns in with owen with whom must come to joyn again too by and by about the scripture and the light and some other things least he thinks am lost in this long bout with t.d so as to be run quite away and never meane to come at him any more

t.d replyes might say that perhaps that clause should be referred to sanctification which is in a more appropriate manner to the spirits efficiency as if the words had been but ye are sanctified by the spirit of our god and he gives his instance for the transposition from math

to all which reply thus ist let the reader observe how t.d dances between two and serves the turn of truth against i.o who blames the

qua and others for denying the text of scripture to be such a certain immoveable stable standard touchstone of all truth as he contends it to be and for calling it a nose of wax not infassible because flexible to every mans fancy while the said td by his twining it which way he finds will fit him best proves it so to be no lesse then practically to our hands yea quid verbis opus est cum facta loquuntur doth not t.d make a very nose of wax a lesbian rule a meer peice of lead of the letter a reeling rule in unstedfast standard when he plucks it to peices as he pleases and makes many meanings of it and then out of them still takes that that best takes with him and makes most for his own penurious purpose for sometimes he turns one text into two senses and when he hath twatled one text into two senses and is so betwatled in himself as not to know which of the twain to betake himself certainly to as the spirits sayes it must be either t'one or t'other or it may be either this or that thrusting out the third be it nere so plain and obvious if it clear the qua cause when indeed exclusively of the qua which is most right and true its neither this or that nor t'one nor t'other witnesse the text in hand sometimes again gives three senses to one text witnesse ioh to which position of christ that true lights enlightning every man that cometh into the world he puts three viz

every man that is enlightned
some of every nation and


everyman who is spiritually enlightned to which three i.o who joyns with t.d in one of his three saying everyman is not spoken absolutely of all and every man but with relation onely to the elect whom he is gratiously pleased to enlighten being not contented with that one single simple sense doubles his files and adds a fourth sense more nonsensicall then all the rest which as senselessely he serves from that scripture phrase as tis in the greeke viz not as the qua speake christ enlightens every man coming into the world but thus the true light coming into the world enlightens every man making the participle undefined span alphabet to agree with undefined span alphabet and not with undefined span alphabet which but that considering the order and placing of the words in the greek its far more cleare that way wherein its construed by the qua considering its analogy as so with the whole scope of the scripture also might with more colour then now it is be wrested the wrong way as it is by i.o and be construed as as tis by him but as much as he hopes to overtop the truth with standing upon the double construction of a greek term yet he cannot by all his taking so much thought about it add one cubit nor yet an irch to the stature of his talk from that scripture but rather pulls him self a pegg or two lower if though yet we will not we should grant him his will in his own way as to his double cause both about the letter and against the light for if the originall text may be so doubtfull as to be truly construed two ways in one phrase or place how fit such a flexible thing is to be counted the onely stable and infailible guide as he pleads it to be to meet fallible men a more foolish wise man and silly scribe then i.o is cannot but and as to the true lights enlightning every man which he impleads thereby what gets he if we grant him his own improper exposition for whether we read the true light enlightens every man coming in the to world or the true light coming into the world enlightens every man it amounts to one and same still and both are

tanta mount to no lesse then what the qua stand for and i.o and t.d against viz that the true light which is come into the world joh
doth enlighten every man that comes into it

so heres more then a good many viz by t.d and by i.o whereof one is of the and t'other a fourth beast divers like the fourth in daniel

from all his fellows that is to say between them both
meanings in all made of one text which mean all together to exclude the quakers fift as an odd one though the onely true one that without mincing and pinching in the mind of the spirit is there intended in the text by the spirit in which it was written for though their senses are some of them true enough to serve out turn yet as they mean not so fully as the spirits true one in proof of the truth of which when we who are of the light and of the day and so needing no proof of it to our selves its so cleare do tell them who are of the night and darknesse that our meaning is drawn from the import of the phrases and ours is the very meaning of the word as the letter of them doth import and ours is the most genuine interpretation of the words as they are taken in the most ordinary and literall sense of them and that their meanings are far forraign and every way improper t.d wipes away all this with a wet finger and though himself know not how argues ad libitum which way he will and none must controle him yet me mutire nefas we must be tyed to take such a sense as is imposed on us as for him he argues sometimes from the figurative and as

christ is said quoth he to be in us by a metonymy of the cause for the effect so

holynesse of that state of the resurrection is cal'd perfect by a metonymy of the subject for the adjunct sometimes from the forraign and more unusuall yea improper sometimes from the most ordinary genuine and proper signification of the words sometimes from as he saith at least but falsly the literal sense and import of the phrases as

as for the phrase in your hearts it imports the same quoth he with that
and

when the kingdom of god is luk

by christ and his said to be in the pharisees that expression may import quoth he that the kingdome which they upon a mistake did look for without them was indeed a kingdome within them and that say is very true t.d himselfe hath there imported the very truth for the expression in you imports the kingdomes not being them in the outward observation wherein they lookt for it but really within them as he said indeed neverthelesse t.d who is like his father that not in the truth cannot abide when he happens to be in it to be long in it neither and is never well till he is out of it again therefore when by hap hazard he had utter'd the truth from the right of the phrase in you cannot rest till he has chang'd his mind and to his first and true hath added another and false meaning so mightily is he enamoured with many meanings and senses and therefore addes another as false as his first was true from another import of the same expression as wrong as his first was right thus to which shall add quoth he that upon thoughts secondae cogitationes are mostly meliores but are must not say maliores for that were false latine though true in english to him that can english it but longe pepres in this place judge the most genuine interpretation to be undefined span alphabet among you so the

preposition may be rendered in which last import of t.d the case is so altered from what it was before that is stead of that one truth could he have kept to it he uttered before he hath now uttered more errours and falsities and absurdities then one for if the proposition may be rendred among and so undefined span alphabet may possibly sometimes as if ever it seldom does import among you yet first it is not usual nor ordinary much less its primary proper literal nor as t.d calls it its most genuine but a most unusual forraign secondary illiteral ingenuine and improper import and
in very deed if t.d will vouchsafe that scripture luke
a review he may come to return to his first judgement which he past in truth viz that the kingdom was indeed within them and upon his second looks to judge as right as he went from the right to iudge amisse upon his second thoughts for what ever undefined span alphabet may improperly import yet in the greek it is undefined span alphabet which imports not among you and can properly import no other sense then truly and properly within you in in opere longe obrepsit somnus as i.o saith and sith non divinum but humanum est errare aliquando bonus dortat homerus but however there's two meanings to that one scripture as t.d sayes it may import so or it may import so so that the reader of may take his choice and read his inalterably of the scribes wrested scripture which way he will and not let it rule him but rule over him as he listeth

thus these two men t.d and i.o impose as many meanings according to their own minds which are not the same that was in christ as they see good on the scriptures and in stead of reconciling them and letting people to whom t.d sayes they seem to be at among themselves see how well are agreed and in stead of causing them like the cherubims to face one another which t.d sayes
is his dury and part of their work they set them at variance by their several senses on them and pervert them by their perhaps's per adventures and pratings against the phrases most proper and for and about their own improper imports saying perhaps its so or else perhaps so the expression may import so but upon the second thoughts iudge rather for it may be srendred the most genuine interpretation is so the meaning is not so as the imports it must be either so or else so or else so or else so as who should say we'l have it any way rather then the qua shall have it theirs and cause it to face three or four wayes at once if never a one of them be right and altogether against within where the onely true way is which wayes the cherubims alwayes lockt with their faces onely inward and they make to it not onely many meanings but any meanings though never so uncouth and contrary to truth sense and reason so they may but wave off and wind away from the right true meaning and mind of christ luke
the kingdom in you is not without but indeed within you and yet upon second thoughts quoth t.d it is not in you but among you

thus the seed of the serpent saves it self alive in its enmity against the holy seed not so much by plain down right dealing nor any bold open facings of the truth quae non quaerit argulos but by creeping into corners shameful from sense to sense mirable marchings from meaning to meaning that one can hardly know well where to have them nor how to find them nor what they mean any more then they who know not which way to take when they have two or three before them of their own devising nor very well what to mean nor very distinctly what they do mean

but as for us nos mutire nefas we may not safely without their censures so much as take the scripture to be what themselves are neither afraid nor ashamed to make them viz a rule a of wax which may be made yet scarcely is by any more then themselves to shew it self in shapes at once
and though they dare themselves and argue any way from figurative and and proper and improper literal or mystical meanings and importments of words and phrases yet they can well digest or with none of all this in us and least of all when we do as we mostly or ever do keep to the ordinary plain purport of the words as they lve open and clear to every ordinary and common capacity that is willing both to know own and do the truth but rather will take any and if one will not serve two meangs at once or one after another whereof one overturns to cross the truest by and leave the reader to chuse which best likes him of two or three so be he will leave that single one of the qua witness t.d who takes on him to domineer over all our truly divine ones with his different and divided ones who when r.h puts that one true one even the same that is expressed in the words on iohn
puts two meanings to oppose it adding
would have him to know that both the meanings are the holy ghosts though but one is intended in that place the will bear either senses that is those aforesaid and either of them css his interpretation and
the meaning of those words iohn
cannot be as the ltter of them does import but it must be either every man that is enlightned or else some of every nation and
it was usual with christ to speak words of a doubtful sense christs meaning may be mistaken when his words are taken in the most ordinary and literal sense and so it would be if by every man we should understand every individual man so that tis your self quoth he to g.w and not that am such a giver of meanings as the iewes who gave theirs contrary to christs meaning and ii when to prove perfect purging from sin here urged psal

ye are justified by the spirit of our god urged by us to prove iustification by the spirit in us
might say quoth t.d perhaps that clause should be referred to sanctification or else justified by the spirit maybe meant of the spirits application which is as much as to say perhaps its this perhaps its that but well know not whether this or that so that the reader may of two take either but will say is wise take for though two strings to his bow still t.d hath for fear one should snap yet neither of here will hold on t.ds side so much as ours nor if both could be twined so as to stand together in one as they cannot they are so divers and destructive to each other would they prove strong enough to reach the butt so but that by his overshort shooting t.d at this time will loose all he shoots for

for first to begin next with thy last clause wherein thou dar'st or at least dost preach out thy meaning not positively but possibly only or by perhaps as in the first that justified by the spirit may be of the spirits application meaning the third person in the trinity as thou term'st it which phrase of justified by the spirit if it may imply such a thing as the holy spirits applying christs righteousness to us yet must it needs imply such a antick applying as thou implyest who falsly imaginest that to be truly applyed to men that stands at such a vast distance as to be no nearer to them then heaven is to earth

if the spirit of god apply righteousness to any man for his iustification doth he do it by the halves as thou vainly hopest so as to impute it where he doth not convey it doth he not do it in a more perfect manner then so as to give him his share part or place in it without its having its share part or any place at all in him is it false doctrine as thy self
r.h relating thou said'st it was to say a man must partake of the righteousness which justifies before it can be imputed to him as his and that is that a mans righteousness any otherwise then imaginarily is it so truly properly and perfectly that he partakes no more hath no more partin nor participation of then meerly by way of computation and supposition onely so as to be counted to him to the steading of him till it be some way or other also actually and really conveyed to him and grant we be justified by the righteousness of another onely and not our own yea for ever be and will be that man say that looks for by any righteousness that is meerly his own eccl

t.d yes quoth t.d why not for the purity and righteousness of another that was made sin for us though he knew no sin that we who yet know no righteousness of our own nor of his neither within our selves might be made the righteousness of god in him from that scripture cor


rep t.d then be like accounts that we are but just so and not a jot otherwise then as he was made sin for us made the righteousness of god in him so as he was made sin that never committed any sin was accounted a sinner that never was so by either nature or practice in his own had

though the realty of our sorrows sufferings and miseries but the meer imputation of our iniquities so we must in him be made righteousness but never perform any and be accounted righteous but never be so by nature or practice in our own persons and have the reality of his rest peace ies and eternal blessedness but the meer imputation onely of his holiness and obedience and as god laid lasht and punisht on that innocent immaculate lamb without spot that never owned nor delighted in any but ever hated all iniquity the iniquity of us all seeing he was willing to become a curse for us all to bear our cross and take our shame upon him so he will put upon such saints all as t.d calls himself and others while in their sins as never owned nor delighted in but ever hatred the doing of righteousness altogether in their own persons the reward of all his personal righteousness seeing also they are as willing as as he was to be for them to be blessed in him to bear his crown and take all his dignities and glory upon themselves for the words of t.d are these

t.d how he is our righteousness cor
ult tells us as christ was made sin for us so we are made the righteousness of god in him but the former was by imputation not inhaerence and therefore so the other
rep how now t.d what is it so indeed even so and not otherwise that as christ was made sin for us which was secundumte by imputation onely never inherence so we are made righteousness i.e by imputation onely never by inherence art thou not a loud lyar in this if not then farewell all hopes of ever having any righteousness at all in themselves to those blessed ones that hunger and thirst after it not only in this world where such are to be filled but also that world wich is to come and as for such as hating righteousness are in hopes to be held righteousness and saved without it and by that alone which is in christ without them they need not fear so much as they do its entrance so far into them as to have dominions over them for if his word be worth taking t.d warrants them that as christ never entred into though he was tempted to it nor transgression into him but it was onely accounted to him so as to be rewarded with evil upon him so god will never let them come into his righteousness nor let it come into them to trouble them with that tedious transformation of them from the fashions of this old world by the renewing of their minds into a new creature but onely adde or leave them to adde iniquity unto their iniquity that when the iniquity of these saints is at the height the of christs righteousness may be given them

but seeing there's no such haste nor much need to make mad folks run who can find the way fast enough to hell whether facilis discersus the descent is easie and the devil eager and skilful enough to drive them without t.d.s doctrine to help him shall check the wilde colt in his course which lacks much more to be fetcht in with the spirits bridle then forc't on with t.ds spurre in order whereunto deny the first proposition of ds last argument as utterly untrue for that scripture cor

ult tells us not so as he faith it tells us it doth not say as christ was made sin for us we righteousness in him as t.d repeats it to the perverting of it as by his perverse readings repetitions rendings renditions sundry silly senses and manifold foolish meaning

he perverts many more but it faith of god that he made him sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him and that's another matter then t.d makes of it who first writes it down the wrong way and then wrests it to a worse end for if it were truely so but that text sayes not that it's so as t.d it then to transpose his own words
as christ is no sinner by inhaerent defilement but by imputation onely so his members must for ever be no saints by any inherent holiness or purity but imputation onely and as christ never was the subject inhasionis of what we were such subjects of viz sin lust filth envy hatred and other works of the flesh which the light condemns but was accursed for them onely as things done by us and not him so we never be such subjects as he was of the contrary graces and fruits of the spirit love ioy meekness temperance but must onely be saved for them as things done by him but never from them to all eternity but remain as he was in all points of misery cursedness affliction infirmity evil and sorrow tribulation temptation like unto us transgression and sin onely excepted heb
so in all points of mercy blessedness ioy peace power glory rest good consolation and happiness like unto him inherent grace righteeousness and holiness onely excepted and so the body that is united to that head must abide absolutely for ever as filthy as the head it self perfectly holy which is a doctrine as false as falshood can make it and a matter not onely ridiculous and monstruous to imagine but more monstruously ridiculous if that meer imagination should be true

humano capiti cervicom pictor equinam iungere si vellet risum teneatis amici

and if the summe of whole doctrine from the scripture is this viz as the iust once suffered for the unjust but was never made inhaerently unjust by his injustice so the unjust are saved for the iust ones sake but must never be made inhaerently just by his justice shall yet insist upon it as at all inferred from that place desire him in order to his satisfaction to the contrary to eye it a little better as it is in the greek and then instead of arguing thus as he falsly does that as christ was made sin so we are made righteousness by imputation not inherence he may as do find good ground from thence to argue thus viz if christ was made sin but by imputation onely not inherence and we righteousness not by imputation onely but inherence then not so he was made sin for us are we made the righteousness of god in him but in another manner but the former is true therefore the latter

in proof of the former let it be well weighed how the apostle when he sayes god made him sin for us uses the word undefined span alphabet which is of a far more shallow and slender signification then that he uses when he saith that we may be made righteousness of god in him viz undefined span alphabet which is a word of a deeper dye for howbeit they both are rendred by this term made in the english text yet do found forth two different sorts of makings whereof the one is not so real and substantial as the for the words undefined span alphabet though they do signifie a true making sometimes and may truly be translated efficio and passive efficior yet is at most but a making of a more as may so say sleightby external

and accidental kind then the other sometimes such a one as amounts to no more then a meer accounting or reckoning a matter to be so or so as it is thereby said to be made wereupon they are sometimes rendred not onely in many other secondary sense as by afficio undefined span alphabet afficio te malis also by causo pono propono redulo colloco sometimes simul when one is said to be made a child an heir that is not so born by but used also sometimes to express existrimo and to signifie the making of a thing no otherwise then by meer and and so god is said here to make christ sin for us who knew and did no sin in himself but the word undefined span alphabet signifies such a solid sort of making as gives the thing not a meer notional and accountative but a real and no less then a true natural being so or so as it is thereby denominated to be made for if more can be its more then sio factus sum am made even no less then nascor gignor natus genius siam am so or so bern so by birth so by nature not by some meer external fabrication or function as a dead painted picture that hath the shew shadow and name and not the life and being of what it represents much less by meer fiction imagination or bare empty computation onely but by a real infusion impartition and conveyance of the nature of the efficient itself into the effect so that it is according to the measure thereof as truly inhaerent and resident in the one as in the other as the nature of the vine in the branches
tis to be observ'd that when ever we are said to be made anything truly really that christ was so when ever christ is said to be made anything that he really was it is exprest mostly if not ever by that verb undefined span alphabet when the saints are said to be the sons of god though adopted because they were once degenerated into another seed by sin into that favour freely by his gift of grace yet to be by that same grace begotten also back again to himself from beneath and born from above of his spirit renewing them by a washing of regeneration john

heb

for as much as the children were partakes of flesh and blood he took part of the same and where they were partakers of sin he took not part with them in that but only

took part of their sorrows and took on him to be a curse to redeem them from it so undefined span alphabet and thus we are here said undefined span alphabet to be made i.e by a new birth and not a bare naked account by the righteousness of god in christ and this is not so as t.d dreams it is but far otherwise then so as christ is said to be made sin which is not as t.d truly says by inhaerent defilement or real participation of the serpents seed between which and him there is eternal enmity nor of that sinful nature image which man was not created in and after but contracted to himself by the fall neither took he upon him that of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham but we who are of abrahams faith and not of your meer adamical fancy are made not computatively onely but inhaerently righteous before god in him by a real participation of his own divine nature so as whilst bodily in the world to escape the pollution and corruption that's in the world through lust whereby so far as partaking thereof as naturally to seek the things of gods kingdom as ye who as yet are by nature his children who hath you to himself from god who made you upright do take care by pleading for sins necessary continuance in you here to uphold the fleshly glory of the devils kingdom

so that as to that ridiculous retort of t.d to r.h his argument whereby from the vnion between christ and the saints who sayes in them and they in me r.h concludes that christ and his righteousness are in the saints and which t.d refels foolishly thus
t.d viz
if that vnion makes us to be the subjects of what christ is the subject because he is in us then hope it will make christ the subject of whatever we are because we are in him and then christ is a sinner by inhaerent defilement

rep say what ere thou hopest hope no such matter and thy self all whose hopes are yet but vain wilt hope another matter then thou dost when thou once comest to hope truly in christ iesus thou hopest it seems at being loath to part with thy sins that thou hast sufficient union with christ to thy iustification while thou art the subject of nothing but sin and without being the subject of him within thee or his righteousness either or else it must follow that he is a sinner and the subject of thy sin because as thou hopest thou art in him but tell thee thou hath neither part nor portion in this matter of in them and they in me to thy iustification before god nor ever shalt till thou witness thy self as really born into and by a new birth made after his righteous image as thou falsly hopest thou art with god counted righteous for his sake before thou feel him and his righteous image revealed wrought brought forth and formed in thee and as for thy inference of sins being in him because his saints be in him drawn from our asserting his righteousness to be in his saints because he is in them its a weak and decrepid deduction forasmuch as first his being in them and they in him can neither of them possibly be any sooner nor any further then in such time and measure as the body of the sins of the is put off by his circumcision of them to himself without hards that they may be both to dwell in him in whom

no sinner while so hath any inheritance or habitation and fitted for him to dwell in being made an holy habitation for him by his spirit for if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are past away all things become new though ye old creatures as far as your thoughts can thrust you and as far as your meer imagining of your selves to be in him when ye not can let you in who will needs be intruding yourselves into him impudently before your time and if any man be in christ iesus in whom to them that are in him there is no condemnation he must be out of the transgressions to the least of which the condemnation is till it be condemned as well away from as in his and must walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and again if christ the lord come into any man as his temple the sinner cannot abide the day of his comming nor stand at his appearing mal

yea if ever christ be in you the body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteousness rom

and assuredly both christs being in his saints
and they in him were neither of them intended of god to that end that in such wise as they of righteousnesse by him so he should be the subject of inherent sin but both one and t'other to one and the same cleane contrary end and purpose viz onely and alone their deliverance in him from the sin in which they could never be just or any better then abominable in his sight but not in any that they should be saved from the sin and he by being in them become the subject of it in their stead that we might be made the righteousnesse of god in him and not he the image of satan forever in our room so its said pet

that christ once suffered for our sins the just for the unjust not that he might bring us to god only and not bring god to us nor so as to own and count us holy in our sins but to bring us to be gods children by nature and image and not to bring us to be so thought and yet us like the devill much lesse to make himselfe by sin like the devil and that this is the onely end its said for what the law could not do in regard it was through our flesh god sending his own son in the likenesse of sinfull flesh and for sin condemned sin in that the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh as all sinners and no saints do but after the spirit rom
which is one viz the of the scriptures above named am under the examination of t.d's
admirable answers too which that may rid my hands on't while tis in hand and not need to take it in hand any more and also because his answer to it suits so well with what am here saying not mattering so much order as to tarry till its turn comes shall take notice of his answer to it and by a briefe reply take it out of the way as go having no other of the verse then myself do he grants that the verse imports the end for which god sent christ viz that the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in us so far he is right and runs with me but then he speedily spoils all again adding that by that term in us is meant not in our own persons but in christ his righteousnesse imputed to us as if it had been inherent in our selves which told him then when he uttered it as he relates
was his own meaning

but not pauls to which his yes started up against my no and so it ended for that time

but a word or two with thee t.d about it now is the sense and meaning of that term in us not in us but in another not in our persons but in christ

never heard so much in all my dayes that know of till had it from thee and if thou hadst not told me so should never have believed it to have been so any more then can believe it now thou dost tell me it is so and that is to say the truth not at all for if this be so that when the spirit of god sayes in us we must understand him as intending not in us but in some other can't tell where we shall have him nor how to understand him distinctly more then one can understand thee who oft speakst on thing and thinkst another and hast so many meanings for one scripture somtimes that thou know it not which to take for true nor which of them all to fix upon as the spirits but hangst thy people up in the aire there to hover with thy self in the clouds of darknesse till neither thou nor they know well either where ye are or what ye say nor whereof ye affirm
but surely though thou thinkst as all takers of gods covenant into their mouths that hate to bereformed and cast his words behind them do that god is such a one as thy selfe psal

and goest about to make thy more talkt on then well known unity in trinity a trinity of vain talkers and meer mockers of men like thy self saying one thing meaning oft another viz that god offers salvation to all men but intends it onely to a few or at least by thy own confession offers it to more then he intends it though believe thy words were as r.h rehearses
and that twast an usuall thing with christ to speak words of a doubtfull sense so that his meaning may be mistaken by none but illiterate say when his words are taken in the most ordinary and literall sense by every man not meaning every individuall but a very few and by all but some and that the meaning of the spirits words joh
cannot be as the letter of them doth import ut prius
and so here that by in us they all three mean not in our persons but in christ and a deal more of such hoberdipoise but let the father word and spirit which are one be true in their witnesse in heaven and every man a lyar that belyes them as thou doest for there is no such matter as thou intimately of them but the wayes and words of wisdome are all plain to him that understandeth pro

and dark to none but the children of darknesse and parables to none but such as seeing see not therefore must not see the mysteries of the gospell which are revealed to babes nor his secrets which are hid to none but such as fear not him whose secrets are with those that fear him

blind priests and people hate the light therefore of truth can have no sight

else how easily might they see that god christ and the spirit mean as they say and do not mean by all but a few nor by in out nor here by in us in another or not in us and if this may passe for a current answer to say god by yea means not yea but nay which he that hath his fingers in the fire and will not pull them out at the hearing of tis almost pitty but he should be burnt
this is an easier way to put off truth by then the common creephole of all the clergy when they

are cronded up into a corner viz in aliquo sensu ita est in alie sensu non in one sense tis so in another not which may serve not t.d onely who hath more senses to one scripture then every one hath or he should have though not enough to serve his turn but also the veriest duncicall disputant in the world
yea at this rates when paul tells us that if christ be not in us we are reprobates and tis christ in us onely who is the hope of glory if were minded not to admit of such a troublesome guest in my heart as christ is to all such saints as t.d's
saints are could easily turn him out into the stable as they did of old that could afford him no room at all in the iune and excuse my selfe in it well enough too by telling him in t.d's distinction that by in us paul means not in us but in christ and so tell christ he is in us enough to our justification if he be but in himself

and as this last sense or senselesse meaning of t.d who sayes by in us is meant not in us but in another as also that the righteousnesse that is in another i.e christ is in a sense too as good as i.e by imputation ours and in us for that which is fulfilled not in our persons but in christ is according to t.d in that scripture rom

said to be fulfil'd in us as if it had been inherent in selves
say as that distinction of t.d concerning in us not meant in our persons but in christ and by in christ when fulfilling the righteousnesse of the law is spoken of ministers latitude and liberty enough to our ministers whereby to fence of and save themselves from truth so it lends liberty and license more then enough to their priestlike people to save themselves in their sins for what will many care what they do themselves if the law be not to be fulfil'd in themselves by christ but tis enough in themselves fulfil'd to their justification if in christ for them and as well as if it were inhaerent in them so though the priests oft preach thus viz he that made us without our selves will not save us without our selves yet fith they to the contradiction of themselves as oft unpreach it again saying he that made us without our selves will save us without our selves by anothers fulfilling the law not in us but in himselfe for us their people will quickly cry hang sorrow and care and of their two selfe confusing doctrines cleave to that thats next to them easiest and most fitting their turns and fall a preaching presently in their works the pleasing things their priests who do docere faciendo faciendo do preach both in words and deeds he that made us will save us and shew us mercy without any goodnesse of our own
if in another in us be and in us in another wee'l ne'er be good good deemd are we in this in that ith rather
so having wiped out by the way that blot or blurr'd answer of t.d to my argument from rom

seeing his answer to what we urge from rom

the of the scriptures above said is as neer in kind to it for fillynesse as that verse from whence we argue is neer in truth to the and
he here make as short a dispatch and round a reply to that too now am about it arg
the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free the law of sin and death saith paul and say we the law of the spirit that is in christ and in the saints whereby the saints are justified is the same therefore the work of the spirit of christ in us is the cause of our justification

that place quoth t.d's
but trow not is much against you for the apostle asserts the holiness of mans nature as a work of the spirit conforming it to the law to be the meritorious case of our freedome from sin and death

rep
thus far is son and not against us am well assured for tis no lesse then the very cardinall truth we plead for against t.d that the holynesse of our nature as a work of the spirit conforming it to the law is the deserving cause of justification for conformity to the law cannot deserve condemnation but and so which is all one justification and if this be not enough on our side t.d adds more let me add quoth he

that the law of the spirit of life here spoken of is not onely the meritorious cause of our freedom from death but from the law of sin or obeying sin as a law in all this own t.d whose answer to my argument is thus far as answerable that is as yeilding to it as do desire
but then t.d whose manner it is often to give a thing and take a thing which is the devils gold ring as have heard children say when was a child doth not in all this give the cause to us so much but he thinks he gets it and carryes it away from us again as much in other parts and particulars of that his parti coloured answer but hope we shall fetch it all again and no thank to him for his gifts and grants sith what he gives he would have it all again if he could tell how and he thinks he plucks much from us again by saying thus viz mark withall quoth he though grant you the holynesse of mans nature as a work of the spirit conforming it to the law is the meritorious cause of our freedom from sin and death yet tis not that which is in us but in christ the law of the spirit and so the holynesse of mans nature and paul of is that in christ and not that in our persons


to which reply thus

what if should answer t.d that by in christ is not meant in christs person but in us lionis to serve him in his own kind for when we say with that the righteousnesse of the law is by christ condemning sin in to be fulfilled in us he answers us thus that by that term in us is not meant in our persons but in christ might as well say retro that by in christ is not meant in christs person but in us adbomim it holds well enough till t.d recants his own odde distinction of the same kind but as its as unfound in itselfe as his is so t.d is not yet come to bear it to be done to by us as he does to us and therefore must sit him to a better answer

then reply that thought the law of the spirit of life be in christ yet not onely in him or exclusively of its being in the saints but so as that from him and from his being in them it consequently and upon that account is in them also for christ is not in any as their righteousnesse in whom his righteousnesse and the spirit of life that is in him is not together with him also yea though it will not follow as thou fainest from the saints being in christ who were once sinners to their sins being in christ together with them so the reasons above said where told thee that men must leave their sins behind them and be by christ divested of them before they can come indeed to be in christ to whom no sinners while sinners are or can be united unlesse thou wilt contradict paul who faith what concord between christ and belial yet if christ be in

saints who leaves nothing of his own behind him where ere he comes his righteousnesse holynesse and spirit of life is in them also

but no more of this confesses it
tis true quoth he that the same spirit is in christ and in his saints but then he hath a double bolt for all this wherewith to shut us out from justification by that spirit in christ as in us

the spirit in us doth not conform us to the law fully quoth he notwitstanding your vain assertion of perfection
rep
never said that the spirit of christ in you did conform you fully to the law if when thou sayst conform us thou meanst your selves for ye are farenough from perfection to whom it seemes a a doctrine of devils to talk of or reach it and how should the spirit conform you to the law who though you have it striving in you and reproving you of sin yet do in the stiffnesse and uncircumcis'dnesse of your hearts and eares alwayes quench grieve resist it refuse to be led by it and will not walk after it but after the flesh but the saints and such onely are all those that walk after it and not after the flesh it eitheir conforms them to the law and that fully too or else what doth it conform them to partly the law and partly the lust partly to it selfe and partly to the flesh doth it lead any into any sin which is transgression of the law or onely out of all sin all such as give up to be guided by it if any be at all deform'd it is because they conform to the flesh and follow it and stop the spirit but if any conform to the spirit and follow it it will conform them fully to the law and not to the forms fashions foolish fellowships and lusts of the world but transform them from all these by the renewing of their minds and lead them to perfect holynesse in the fear of god thy vain assertion to the contrary in any wise norwithstanding
thus the st bolt is broken but quoth he if the spirit did conform us to the law fully yet were not that conformity the merit of justification
rep oh strange that t.d should deem theres strength in this to stand out against us by which is far weaker then the former doth the spirit working holinesse in our natures and persons not merit justification which is are christ and his spirits works of lesse or worse merit in one time place and person then another judg'd they had been every where and alwayes alike and of like good desert from the dignity of the person doing them or else t.d lyes
of his
pamp and especially that their good works which are the fulfilling of the law deserve justification or else t.d lyes again in that same page but sith the spirit of life and works of holinesse in our nature and persons conforming them fully to the law do not as t.d
said before they did from the dignity of christs person deserve for their conformity to it or transgression of it merits one thing or other good or evill and we use to say no truly good work deserves evill more then an evill work merits good we will take it for granted that t.d thinks the spirits conforming us to the law deserves condemnation and so let it stand that all people may understand the blasphemy and folly of it
thus t.d pulls hard to have his own again but what he can't win by force of false position heel see if he can beg it back from us in these following fawning questions

would fain know what or whether precedent holynesse in the saints merits subsequent holynesse or whether the exercise of what they have is the meritorious cause of what they have not or of perfection especially if the law of sin intends the corruption of nature as the law of the spirit of the life does holynesse of nature would be instructed how a nature in part corrupted can deserve totall freedome and am sure the first work of the spirit renewes our nature but in part

rep
if should grant t.d in the negative all he asks as he thinks will my negative or denying or saying were such answer to his questions as he desires but if should say yea to all his it dashes him down and denyes all he would have and yet must say yea to most of them if say the truth
therefore t.d
say yea to some and nay to some to the answer yea that precedent holynesse in the saints merits subsequent holynesse and to the ad answer yea the exercise of what the saints have is a meritorious cause of what yet they have not and sith thou askest what precedent holynesse the saints exercising of when they have it deserves subsequent holynesse or what they have not answer all that is the fruit of the spirit in them and the gift of god to them whether active or passive if to merit be to be worthy of a thing by right of promise at least
twas given to the saints both to believe and suffer phil

yet they were worthy of the kingdome for which they suffered by beleiving the testimony of it and suffering for it thess

twas the gift of god by promise to such as fight and ouercome to walk with christ in white and the gift of god to the saints that they could sight and by his strength overcome yet they shall walk with me in white faith christ for they are worthy
twas gods gift to do his commandements yet for all that the doing thereof deserves that they yet have not and without the doing of which they should not enter by right gives right to enter the citty and eat of the tree of life rev

five talents and two and one were gods gift yet as he that did not encrease and improve what he had merited at least the losse of it so they that exercised the and the merited the doubling of theirs and by promise had right using what they had and being faithfull in few littles to many and to more abundance and to the joy of the lord much more might say but t.d denyes in this the doctrine of his fellow divines who tell that the improvement of grace as they call it deserves not the gift of speciall but the improvement of special grace deserves more of that still so that though they deny a meritorious transition a genere ad genus from exercising of one kind of grace say they men deserve not another kind as he that improves riches deserves not righteousnesse yet a desert say they there is by the exercise of some grace of one kind of more of the same kind as he that is holy deserves more holynesse and he that sowes to the spirit of life shall have life everlasting as he that sowes to the flesh reaps a crop as all persons are to do suitable to their seed of more corruption and if purchase may be granted to be meritorious of what is purchased he that useth a lower ministration the office of a deacon well purchaseth to himself saith paul
a good degree and great boldness in the faith in christ iesus and he that will entertain holynesse and christ when he knocks to come in deserves to have the devill and uncleannesse

driven out by him whose work it is to destroy the works of the devill and the very end of his comming into the world as till a man does he deserves the devill should dwell in him still as he must do and not christ because existens proh betalienum

and as to the last query about which t.d would be instructed as see he had need say no corrupt nature deserves totall freedom but the holy nature which is in bondage to the corrupt nature which is the enmity and to be slain and never reconciled for it is the devills that deserves to be freed from the other that usurps over it as esau did over iacob a while the heir of all and as the seed of the woman deserves to be delivered from the enslaving seed of the serpent
and as for the spirits renewing our nature but in part at thats true but every part of that renewed nature is perfect and perfectly renewed in a measure and not partly renewed and partly corrupted as shewed t.d above every part of that which in its nature is perfect being truly perfect as the whole is
so having totally taken away two of t.d's
miserable mistaking answers to two of the above named scriptures whence we disputed with him the justification of saints by the gracious works of christ and his spirit in them and not those in christs person onely it matters not much now am gone abroad from following the first began upon fully to an end if fall upon that in tit
and make as quick a riddance of his gracelesse answer to that and shall have no more to do but go to an end with that in cor

which am a little digres't from proceeding in for a while and with that shall make an end for altogether as to this time with t.d about the way of our justification by the holynesse righteouscesse and grace of christ as inhaerent in us
our argument is much what the same yet somwhat stronger then t.d relates it
viz that the grace of eternall life being that grace which ver
though oppos'd to the works of righteousnesse which we work of ourselves without the spirit yet is the same thats otherwise call'd washing of regeneration and the renewing of the holy spirit it follows that we are justified by the washing of regeneration and spirit of christ within renewing us
to this saying in word am much mistaken in deed mistakes himselfe much more in his answering thus viz that grace there is meant not of sanctification but of the savour of god which is manifest in the donation of his son to us imputation of his righteousnesse and acceptance of us as righteous in him

rep what a messe of gracelesse grace is here of t.d's making heres grace with a witnesse almost all manner of grace mentioned as materiall and of moment in the matter of justification but one which is of so much use that all the rest are in a manner uselesse till it come in and which makes all the rest grace so that to say no more then then truth they are no grace to us before it or without it and that viz sanctification while others are included is onely and alone excluded poor sanctification its set aside its thrust out still from entring the lines of communication among its fellows
stands against the dore so that if he may rule

the rost men shall be in favour with god and contrary to what divines commonly say when they say as they do all that sanctification manifests iustification and the favour of god have it manifested too in the donation of his son to them the imputation of his righteousnesse and acceptance of them as righteous in him and so consequently a title to the inheritance the kingdome glory and all the good that heaven affords to all eternity but washing regeneration sanctification renovation by the spirit sanctification and from the sins which sins deserve the wrath the curse and the condemnation which salvation from the sins alias sanctification must be before any well grounded hope of escaping the codemnation curse and wrath to come can be had this latter sort of grace is shut out for a wrangler by the wrangling contenders against the truth who had rather obey unrighteousnesse then it and their lusts then him they call their lord and saviour and must be none of the ingredients among the company of causes of mens acceptance with god and being accounted righeous by him but if they be not righteous and holy must be counted to be so without it and if they be so must be counted so by that which resides in another person by which till it come into themselves they are not made so and without it by the being of which as in themselves and not as in another they can onely undefined span alphabet be truly made and really become righteous and holy and so that grace which mainly if not onely as it is a gift gives the proper name and nature of grace to all the other grace may say of it self cum nemo extru potest itur ad me when none ought to be excluded as not meant where every grace god is mentioned in the gospell onely am left out alone and they seek my life also

but go too t.d thou must not have thy wicked will in this wise against gods about this thy so bold a bolting out of this grace of sanctificatin from concomitating and concurring together with faith which is but a part of it the whole series of the particular graces of which generall grace of sanctification are all fruits of the spirit in the matter of our being counted just in the sight of god but as blindly buisy as thou art to tell us in a far other sense then paul does that if it be of grace then not of works and if of works not of grace yet must tell thee that albeit it be of grace and as paul sayes truly rom

and in this
tit

not of works of righteousnesse which we work in our own wills wisdom and strength in obedience to the law without christ and the spirit who onely can conform us to it and fulfill it in us otherwise grace indeed is no more grace but it being of grace that kind of work is no more work
yet it is not so of grace as that the fruits of the spirit sanctification washing renewing and the works of christ in us are excluded otherwise christs own works absit blasphemia are no more works and of no such force and worth as thou blushest not to blaspheme so as to say they are not

as to merit justification
yea so necessarily is it of such good works as are wrought in us by christ that otherwise grace it selfe were no more grace for what grace is that of being so or so so long as we are not in truth so as we are accounted to be accounted justified accounted accepted with god and accounted his children heirs of his kingdom righteous holy saved from our sins which whiles they abide the wrath of god abides and condemnation and cursing

hangs over the head of the subjects thereof and yet not really to be so as none are and as nemine contradicente without all contradiction none can know themselves to be till sanctification which is the evidence for heaven and that which to us and all men shewes our title to all the foresaid priviledges and prerogatives doth appeare upon us say what grace is all this what salvation from sin whiles sin remaines what redemption from the and curse the effects of sin while sin the cause thereof rests on us unremoved all this faith of the favour of god is but fiction this hope of heaven but vain groundlesse heartlesse and frustraneous this divination of t.d a meer dream of a hungry thirsty man that dreames he eats and drinks but as its said before his soul is empty and when he awakes behold its another matter oh but quoth t.d the spirit of god the person in the trinity he does apply the righteousnesse of christ to us to our justification and so we are justified perhaps say you qua
what you will and not upon account of sanctification of us by his work grace of in our hearts and so that phrase justified by the spirit which ye insist so much on con

may be meant of the spirits application

rep
mark reader for having run throw the other
return now to the of the
scriptures that we urged from and t.d answers so lamely to t.d sayes perhapse its meant of the spirits application to which say twere better for t.d's cause if it might be so meant but for one reason shall shew it may not must not cannot unlesse t.d means a nigher kind of application then am sure he does for if by justified by the spirit be there meant of the spirits outward application onely or imputation of christs righteousnesse without us to our justifying before god then the work of the spirits washing and sanctifying us also must be meant of the spirits application only and meer imputation of the cleannesse and holinesse of christ to us for our washing and sanctification for paul sayes the same of them they all hang on one string and must run the same way and be taken in the same sense relating all to that one author thereof the spir such viz
drunkards effeminate adulterers
were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified by the spirit of our god so if one justification be by externall application onely then the other viz our washing and sanctifying is but by such an empty application and outward account and imputation onely and not by the inward holy operations of the spirit

and indeed all your grace is one part of it as well as another by such outward application and meer computation onely and not by any true real internal application of christs righteousness sufferings and blood to your souls and consciences to the purging of them from dead works to the true serving of the living god your iustification is by imputation and outward application your washings regenerations sanctifications holinesses renovations and all ye have is by such a meer imputation and application of what is far off you in christs person to your selves so that what ever he is in whom is no sin you will deem and dream that god deems you so to be upon nothing but a meer blind confidence and conceit that swimmes in your brain that tis so when tis no such thing god knows and so as one that being at the

north of scotland hungry and naked should in his thoughts onely apply a garment or a mess of meat to himself that's as far off him as the south of england must needs perish for want on't if it be brought and applyed no neerer to him then so so you in all your applications of christ and what ever is in him who is as far off as heaven whil'st you are but on earth far enough from thence the lord knows must necessarily faint famish perish pine and starve till ye come to witness christ and the robes of his righteousness and holiness within your selves and eat his flesh and drink his blood and put him on a little more effectually then ye do by all your dead faith and your eatings and drinkings of bread and wine for all your imagined spirits applyings and imputings by which that the whole world which already may and you together with it lye still in wickedness ye are ever dispelling and disputing all true inherent out of and so being but in a meer aery talk and vain thought of things that ye are in them when ye are out of them and not doers your selves of what ye hear christ hath done for you before as an ensample that ye should by his power in the leadings of his light and spirit do the same ye do but deceive your own souls and as both paul and iames who both agree and we with them against you in this do truly tell you as righteous and as ye seem to be to your selves and each to other all your religion is but and your hopes that ye are this and that in the account of god that ye are iust and pure when really ye are nothing so will prove abortive and as that of the hypocrite when the lord takes away his soul no other then the giving up the ghost for gal

if any man think himself to be something and that he is thought of god for that holiness which is in another without him to be something when he is nothing and witnesseth neither that other nor his holiness within himself he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and what he doth by the spirit of christ within himself of the will of god and then shall he have rejoycing with in himself alone or at least and not in another person without him onely and he that glorieth will gly in the lord christ in him the hope of glory in the lord in himself in whom the seed of israel finds righteousnesse and strength and salvation from the sin is iustified and shall glory a

or not every one that commendeth himself as iustified by christ will appear approved at last but he whom the lord commendeth which is no man of sin that know of which david himself stood condemed in cor


so having snaptasunder one of the two strings to his bow by which strove to shoot back to us that arrow and shast which was sharp in his and in the heart of all the enemies to justification by the spirit of grace and life within us from cor

which pretended to no great strength it self being a string made but of a meer may be or perhaps for justified by the spirit if not otherwise may be meant quoth he of the spirits application come to try the strength of his other string which is patcht up of no better then such a poor peice of toe too as peradventure or perhaps for when we say with paul in the text the saints are washed sanctified and justified all one and the same way viz in the name of the lord iesus and by the spirit of god and his grace and holy operations in us who

confesses he chose to us see his epistle and is never to seek for something or other to say though his aliquid is ever nihil sayes thus
might say that perhaps the clause should be referr'd to sanctification which is in a more appropriate manner attributed to the spirits efficiency as if the order of the words had been but ye are sanctifyed by the spirit of our god

rep
then it seemes justification must go look its efficient somewhere else and must have no share with washing and sanctification in the spirits holy workings in the saints it must be in the name of god only and the other onely by the spirit as if the name and spirit of god were such heterogeneous matters that whats done by one cant be said to be done by the other and as if paul had mistooke himself in the placing of his words and had been by the infallible spirit misguided misplacing of them so that when he should have said ye are justified onely in the name of the lord and onely wash't and sanctified by the spirit of god confusedly crouds these effects all under one cause and sayes ye are not onely washt and sanctified but ye are justified also in the name of the lord and by the spirit of our god
do not wonder thou purst in this with perhaps only for hadst thou absolutely affirmed it for a positive truth thou hadst of a truth lyed thy self into a very laughing stock to the lowest capacity in the country by thy talk of so transcendently untrue a transposition

but such traspositions are not without instance in the scripture quoth t.d as math

give not that which is holy to dogs nor cast ye your pearls before swine least they trample them under their feet and turn again and rent where turn again and rent you is joyned to the dogs quoth he for as swine ds trample under their feet so dogs do fly upon a man and tear him down
rep
we know well enough its the property of dogs and swine to turn and and when pearls and holy things are held out to them having paid pretty well for the experimentall learning of it we have since we began to tell the pretious truth and hold out such a holy thing as inhaerent holynesse is to such an unholy seed as your selves are but am to learn that these these ill qualities of turning tearing trampling do not all
jointly agree to both or either of these creatures severally considered yea all of them as much to one as to the other for as dogs turn and tear so do swine and as swine trample under their feet what tear so do dogs or else the scripture which is very unlike to d's
scripture about it is in this case utterly unlike it self for it tells us of the gentiles which in oppsition to the children are called the dogs math

which are without the holy citty or any right to enter there rev
though in their anger envy canina utentes facundia they grin like a dog and go round about it psal to whom yet the outward court of the temple externall forms worships observations ordinances and name of christians is given that they tread or trample the holy citty under feet rev

no marveil therefore the cat winkt when both her eyes were out and that t.d durst not speak his mind out positively nor point blank neither one way nor another in answer to our argument from that scripture cor

but only by perhaes seeing he was so blinded by it that he saw nothing what to return directly and downrightly to it and since he puts it off to us with no more force then perhaps it is so or perhaps so as he sayes tis though

have said much more for satisfactions sake to such as seek the truth yet to such as seek nothing more then how they may cavill against it and turn it off from taking hold on either their own hearts or the hearts of others need do no more then put it all back upon again with it is so or so as say tis against him it being a generall generall received maxime among all schoolmen that an argument that flyes in ones face with no more force then forte ita requires to be no more forcibly refel'd then with forte non
yea forte ita semper sat bene solvitur per forte non

thus have at last made a clear end with as to this matter of justification having to the undeceiving of such as by his misty makings out of our meanings in it have much mistaken me and the qua as about it shewed plainly which way we hold it and how it is according to the scripture of grace and not of works our works properly and onely so call'd and yet not of grace onely but of works also such as christ and his spirit only works only in us which the spirit in a sense subordinate to himself who is the to whom onely and gods grace in freely giving us such an alsufficicent assistant to do his will the glory of all belongeth is pleas'd also but more sparingly to entitle by the the term of ours isa
so that had it been as true as if t.d and his witnesses together with him
be to be credited before himself alone tis false that disputed justification in those terms of by our good works as he says
yet if by our works we speak of those that god christ and the spirit work in us it can in no wise follow from thence any more then it doth from all his other pites premises whereby he improves himself to prove me so that am a rank papist nor so much as it followes from the remaining of so many relikes of the romish among our english clergy that they are still living in and loving the skirts of that great whores

indeed to say as t.d doth of s.f
he hath been at rome

he had great bills of exchange from constantinople thither

he witnest against the pope and cardinal there yet was not medled with

he saith he is above ordinances

he saith iesuits and friars are

sounder in doctrine then those call'd the reformed churches he made light on't when he was charg'd with popery before of

he affirm'd justification by our good works

and such as doctrines are a fair inlet to the papists bag and baggage

therefore probably he complyes with the pope and cardinals hath a pension from him and is manifestly a rank papist these or piball'd magpie premises and humb bee propositions whereof some are true and some false may like so many roaring megs and thundring canons make such a hideous rumbling noyse in a country church as they use to say as to frighten poor folck out of their senses and force all people whether they will or no into the faith of what followes at their heels as the conclusion they serve to usher in viz that s.f is a factor for the sea of rome

neverthelesse

there is no more consequence in them though less truth then if a man should argue thus where the antecedent and subsequent are both true though the one very untruly deduced from the other viz
the wheelbarrow runs rumble to rumble therefore the clergy will never leave climbing up by lyes till down they tumble

the second apologetical and expostulatory exercitation
chap
now return again to thee iohn owen whom excepting here and there with a word or two as occasion was have not visited of a long time being by his interposings in this question about iustification which is excentrick from all the points in which thou encountrest the quakers so totally taken off for many pages together from any steady discourse or any but meer cursory conference with thee that some men who measure others by themselves and take an account of the quakers conjunctions with them in contending for truth by the cowardly spirits they carry in their own brests may term it little lesse then shameful or total tergiversation in me to tarry so long from thee and not so much as face thee all this while
and now am come to deal with thee shall freely allow thee the advantage of the utmost assistance that t.ds
book against the quakers and that of or also affords thee to help thee if need be at any dead list where thou art a stand in the doctrines about which have to do with thee which though some are more eminently to be canvased between us two then the rest which are but transiently toucht on by thee yet are no less then the five aforesaid viz

the letter

the light

the infallible spirits present infallible guidance

the universality or particularity of the grace of god to the sons of men

perfection of holinesse and cleansing from sin in this life
in all which five whether in the selfe same order as they are here laid down in or no cannot say nor is it much matter for that as am first or last to speak on or to joyne issue in against thee so more or lesse t.d falls in and joyns issue with thee in them against the quakers so directly that see not how can meddle with one and let the other wholly alone but must unavoidably hold an entercourse briefly or largely as occasion happens either simul or successivè with you both and with tombes and baxt also who whether they meddle in their last book with them all or not so as to prosecute them yet intimate themselves both in that and other of their labours to be of the same minde with you as also most of the divines so called are throughout this nation

now concerning these which are the grand subjects in reference to which all that is said of any of them by either of us in our disputation

about them is but the praedicate so contrary are we as the case yet stands between thy self and me to each other in our assertions that very much if not most of that which is denominated of them respectively by either of us is as absolutely by the other so as whatsoever is as most that thou sayest at all of it is falsly affirmed by thee of the scripture the subject which in a shallow sound of words thou seem'st to stand for but art seen in truth to stand against is utterly denyed by me and most of that which is most truly asserted by me and the quakers of the light and all the rest of doctrines is as positively denyed by thy self though in thy denying thereof thou dost not more evidently contradict both the truth and us then thy silly self who art yet so sensless as not to see it

what testimony it is that we bear of the grace of god the spirits guidance perfection and true light the subjects which we plead for and thou impleadest will be seen when come in all plainness to give it out with the good grounds thereof as at last shall god willing howbeit not till toward the last for as much as in the last place thy false witnesse comes out against it and in the mean while betake my self to the intended tryal of those things which are as blindly as boldly bolted out by thee about the scriptures and to declare wherein we do and wherein we do not and also why it is we do not that we neither do nor may nor can accord at all with thee about the scripture for not assenting to whose meer fancies about which as infallible and undoubted truths having hung up thy flag of defiance against atheists iewes and papists and sought up thy foolish fight also with sundry of thy fellow protestant divines for not dancing after thy unharmonious pipe nor singing to the same truthlesse tune with thee about the scriptures thou beatest up the quarters of the quakers and unjustly against them slandering them as fowlely as falsly in a long latine piece of scholastical scrible as slanderers of the scripture whom yet thou neither dost nor canst evince to be such unless that be to slander the scripture to say no more of it then matter of truth

now for as much as my businesse with principally and in part also with t.d as to the scriptures will lie mainly these two wayes viz
first to clear the quakers from those clouds of ignominy wherewith they as all their fellow commonly do seek to cover them by their lyes of them as a people that deserve to be held accursed among all for their enmity to the scripture
secondly to recover both priests and people as much as may be from under those dark cloudy conceptions of the scripture which these two men being overcast with themselves labour what they can to beget others into as if all the worlds were for ever utterly undone and under the losse of all saving truth and utterly without any possible way whereby to come to the knowledge of the will of god concerning them in order to their souls salvation from sin and wrath to come if the outward letter or external text of the scripture be not talkt up into the throne as the onely lapis lydius ex
sure word of god infallible guide trusty teacher supream iudge perfect rule foundation stable standard fixt unerring unalterable measure and such like as i.o states it to be by which all doctrines faiths words writings spirits

true or false must be toucht tried and determined or else no man can be at any certainty where to be what to believe how to walk with god which to take for truth and which to turn from shall first plainly shew what the scriptures are and what we mean when we talk of scriptures


briefly take notice of some of the base unworthy absurd abuses and fowl aspersions and unjust accusations whereby thou i.o what in thee lies labourest much more abundantly and abominably must needs say then the other as to this point to render us odious to all men as despisers and deniers of them and then dly addressing to the controversie it self leave all who shall read such animadversions as are to be made by me of thy unfound assertions about it to judge by that light of god in their own consciences whether themselves or we erre most beside the scripture or most duly deserve the censure of
first then shall here give all men to understand more distinctly yet then have hitherto done what it is that intend and what would be understood as speaking of by this term the scripture which is to be so often agitated in this discourse between me and i.o in whose book also it is so often agitated and what sort of those holy scriptures it is which is the common subject of which so much is prated and predicated by i.o that is as utterly denyed by the quakers
that we may not by hanging in universals only which are in no wise or sense truly seen but by considering the particulars wherein they exist conclude of things in a tumultuous mist of confusion as thou dost distinguishing where thou shouldst not and jumbling things into a kind of omnigatherum which should be more singly and severally spoken of whose trumpet gives such an uncertain sound that its hard to know either how or where one must prepare to the battel
the word scripture then though it be an vnivocal nor aequivocal as us'd by us yet is it a general term and so ambiguous and doubtful unless it be explained by its particulars signifying not only all other kinds of scriptures good and bad that ever were in the world but also more kinds then one of that kind of scripture which abstractively from and more eminently then the rest in regard of its worth we ordinarily call the scripture and have singled out from all the rest as our present subject
what thou meanst in thy heedlesse handiement of this more general subject can hardly find thou drivest it on when thou praedicatest this and that of it in most parts of thy dispute at randome in general terms and run'st away with the word scripture at all adventure scribling it over again and again the scripture is this the scripture is that the scripture is written by inspiration of god the scripture is the word of god the scripture is entire to a tittle perfect
scarcely shewing which of those three several sorts of it which thy self hast divided it into thou wouldst have us to understand thee as speaking of when thou denominarest these high things of it viz
whether first thou mean the undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet as thou caliest them pag
the individual and immediate manuscripts of moses the prophets and apostles and such holy and honest men as were the first of the sundry parcels of that holy scripture which was copied cut the copy whereof is bound up in the bulk now called the bible

or secondly the undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet the transcribed copies thereof whether first immediate that were at first hand taken out of the first copies or secondly those mighty mediate and far remote ones taken by thou knowst not whom out of thou knowst not what copies that were handed downwards successively not without some mixtures mistakes and for ought though knowest losse of much of what was at first throw all the dark ages since then to this of ours by men that were some faithful and some unfaithful but none of them infallible by thy own confession
or divinely inspired so that it was impossible for them in any thing to mistake which uncertain copies ye have as your only rule and canon at this day in which copies neverthelesse of the originals yet remaining that may secundum te i.o according to thy concession be more or lesse crooked as it happens and thy self granting there are varieties among them cannot be all true thou dost not blush to adde and say that the whole scripture entire as given out from god is preserved without any losse and within them all is every letter and tittle

or thirdly whether thou mean the several and various copies of the translations of those various and several transcriptions into several tongues and languages
what thou meanest say or which of all these three sorts of writings whether the first manuscripts only or the transcripts and translations also or the two first only and not the last or all the three which are all three commonly called undefined span alphabet the holy scriptures when thou praedicatest these glorious things of the scripture thou dost not very distinctly declare but goest on in generals and that dolus latet in universalibus thou art not ignorant so that he had need to be wise that very easily discerns thy mind and what thou meanest yet this know full well and tis the more shame for thee if thou be ignorant of it that some things may be said tru'y of some one of these that cannot without falshood be affirmed of the other two and some things of two that cannot of the third and he understands neither what he saith nor whereof he affirmeth whosoever he is that without distinction denominates all the things that thou dost of the scriptures of these three sorts all alike or of any two of them either most of which will upon due examination not be found duly applicable to the very best

but whether thou intend one or two only or all these three throughout thy book when thou contendest for the scriptures to be now entire to a tittle as at first giving forth to be the light word power of god and such like is not easie to learn
if ever we hear of thee again about the scriptures desire thee to speak home as to these particulars and to write thy mind more fully and plainly and singly out as in all places of thy book thou hast not done but as one that hates the light and is not willing to come to close pinchest in thy mind and winkest and twinklest and triflest and keepest back as if thou wert afraid as no doubt thou art though he that doth truth is not ioh
to look the light too fully in the face or ex
subtilius disputare to dive too deep in thy dispuration about the light or as the elephant to drink more then needs must in fair water

for fear of seeing a foul face but veritas non quaerit

for my part shall deal ingnuously with thee in this there are some things thou affirmest of the scriptures which can grant to be true of some one of these three viz of the undefined span alphabet that are not true of either the undefined span alphabet or translations and there be some things to be said truly of these two that are not true of the first and some things of the second that are not true of the first nor of the third and somewhat of the third thats not true of either of the other
but when thou scarest so high as to affirm the scriptures as thou dost in general to be the same in every tittle syllable and iota as at first to be the word of god the living word the spiritual light the power of god and much more as will appear when come to up and rank the things thou praedicatest of the scriptures in order in order to my answering of them who shall ever put a difference between the writing of the word and the word it self written of do absolutely deny all these things of all the three sorts above mentioned and if it stand so as that thou understandest all these three as thou dost of one of them at least and that of the undefined span alphabet or transcriptions if but of one the undefined span alphabet or first manuscripts being all lost and mouldred and translations all corrupted by thy own confession when thou affirmest all these things of the scripture then so let it stand for me till have tryed the truth of thy positions after which hope all that stands not upon good ground will of it self to the ground come tumbling down

and as by the word scripture mean excepting where such things only are praedicated as are peculiar only to either one or two of them and not to all the three no less then all these three sorts of scripture in the main controversie with thee so no more then these three sorts and these not one jot more not yet any farther then quâ tales so far only as they are scriptures properly truly and formally so called and considered or

outward writings expressions or declarations ad extra by letters legible to our bodily eyes however extant upon what ever outward matter capable to receive their impression tables of stone walls skin parchment paper by the finger of god or hands of men whether writing the issue of which is propriissime stiled scripture or cutting graving stamping printing in which way since that art came up the scriptures are now most extant the effect of which though most properly it be called print or yet not to be too close and curious in criticizing about shall be allowed by me as to our purpose properly enough to passe under that name of scripture

say then tis the letter and not the matter the writings and not the subjects things truths doctrins or word written of that is the subject to come under consideration between us whatever those things are that are therein declared though tis like we shall not passe them by neither without taking some useful notice of them yet that makes nothing to us in the state of our question as it stands before us nor will all thy tumultuous

hudling it over in haste hinder this nor thy shuffles about it shuffle it off it is the declaration that thy disputation with the quakers is about considered as abstract from what is thereby declared for by the scripture intend not the law it self written nor the gospel nor the light nor the faith therein exhibited to us and held forth to be read of in the writing for these are not the scripture nor is the scripture any of these but the writing it self that holds these forth call no other thing the scripture then that which is truly the scripture and that is no other thing then the scripture it self call the scripture or the outward declaration no other things and by no other names then those it calls it self by

or are truly answerable to its nature and that is no other then the scripture a declaration of those things that were believed and of the word of the faith that was preached a letter a writing holy scriptures scriptures of truth books of writing that consist treat of and declare in forms of plain true suitable and sound words various true things sound doctrines by which many unsound doctrines of divels of false prophets priests scribes and pharisees of false brethren ungodly men that creep in and turn the grace of god into lasciviousness of false apostles that brought in doctrines contrary to that at first delivered and served their own bellies and not christ taught for doctrines traditions of men of iannes and iambes that resisted the truth of baldam the nicolaitans of iezebel and satan which are all written of and declared in the scriptures of truth as well as those of god christ the spirit the light and truth it self do stand not approved but reproved and condemned useful histories of what was done and spoken in sundry times and ages past by god and christ and the divel himself and men good and bad and by balaam and his asse also pretious prophesies of things viz of good to the good of bad to the bad comfortable promises to the seed that is the heir of them terrible threatnings to the seed of evil doers and woes to the wicked profitable epistles to such as they were wrote to blessings curses prohibitions commands copies of psalms and songs that were sung proverbs that were spoken letters that were written from men to men some by good men at the motion of the spirit of god some by evil men out of malice against gods servants at the motion of the devil some not without the spirit by such as lived and walked in the spirit and were in all they did led by the spirit to some private christians about some worldly affairs as that of paul to philemon some by chief captains to their presidents and by presidents to their princes about prisoners and tumults and divers other sorts of passages so that as written in the spirit the holy scriptures may be said to be homogeneous writings all of one kind but in respect of the several businesses written of therein they are at heterogeneous a body or bulk of as various writings as any extant in the them

now by the scriptures mean these writings that contain the matters abovesaid and many more and not the matters themselves therein contained and if thou mean by the scriptures any other things then the scriptures themselves as like a reed shaken with the wind thou seemest sometimes to do and again sometimes not to do and which things the scriptures are not or by any other things which are not the scriptures when thou speakest of them viz the law word of god the spiritual light meanest

the scripture as sure enough thou dost throughout thy confused discourses and disputations about it then thy meanings are too mean to be any otherwise at all then meanly accounted on among any that mean honestly and plainly and know the truth as it is in jesus
by us when we talk of the scriptures to use thy own words onely vice versa ex
sect
non sanctissima ista veritas seu materia scripturarium sed scriptura formaliter considerata intenditur honestly and plainly we intend that onely which is so even the form of writing it self and not the matter or holy truths of the scripture the scripturam and not the scriptum or at most the litteram scriptam not the rem scriptam not the verbum scriptum the declaration and not the doctrine declared the undefined span alphabet the undefined span alphabet the undefined span alphabet not the undefined span alphabet not the undefined span alphabet the letter in the oldnesse of which thou art yet serving who knowest not the newness of the spirit the scripture or writings of the prophecy and not the prophesie of or contained in the writing nor the prophetical vvord the undefined span alphabet not the undefined span alphabet the writing for so the word is there translated truly chron chapter
not the vvord written or word of prophesie that came to elijah and was sent in a writing to the king which thou falsly sayest
that hebrew word undefined span alphabet is used for in that text and every wise man that is truly undefined span alphabet and not undefined span alphabet especially in a dispute where the question is whether the writing of the word of god be the word of god written of or no while sub judice lis est will till the thing in debate one way or other be clearly determined remember still to keep these two things as two asunder
so thou dost thy self while thou art well in thy wits witness thy words above cited by myself ex

where thou puttest a plain difference between the scripture it self formally considered and the most holy truth or matter therein delivered yea when ever thou keepest in any measure of sobermindednesse thou keep'st these two as distinct in thy discourse as the two sticks of iudah and ioseph ezek
that were superscribed with two several superscriptions vouchsafing to each its own proper name and not communicating the name of either unto the other but clearly dividing between them so as that any one may see thou thy self dost not believe one of them to be the other nor yet darest affirm them to be synonymous witness
where thou makest them two and writest of one of them all along as in contradistinction to the other in these terms viz not the doctrine in it but the undefined span alphabet it self the providence of god no lesse concerned in the preservation of the writings then the doctrine contained in them the writing it self being the product of his counsel for the preservation of his doctrine satan hath no lesse raged against the book then against the truth contained in it it was no lesse crime of old to be traditor libri then to be abnegator fidel which sour last assertions of thine though they are all four false tales for providence is not so much concerned to preserve the writings as the doctrine neither is the writing so necessary for the preserving of the doctrine that as thou there hintest it must it must needs perish if the writings perish for it was before them and may be without them and will be after them neither thirdly is the malice of satan so much against the book called the bible as against the doctrine of the truth for he is willing to let

hypocrites alone long enough to carry gaudy bibles under their arms so be they serve him and abide not in christs doctrine nor in the truth the scripture tells of neither
is it or ever was it so great a crime to betray the book called the bible as to deny the faith and the word of faith therein written of for the book is not worth a pin as to salvation without the faith but the faith is sufficient thereto without the book and was so before the book was witnesse the worthies from abel to moses whose sufficient faith is written of heb
and would be if the pope and the devils rage should reach so far as to burn all the bibles in the world so here's four utter untruths asserted together neverthelesse as they are yet are they true enough to serve the truth here summon them in proof of viz that thou thy self who countest it as bad not to be as trusty to the bible as to the truth that's in it as it is to betray the truth and deny the faith dost deny the book or scripture the undefined span alphabet or the writing to be one and the same with the faith truth and doctrine or the doctrine to be the writing or that these can truly be denominated each of other

say then that here being more sober minded as to thy discerning between the writing and the written verity though drunk enough elsewise to lay so many lyes or at least so many tales that are not true upon the top one of another in so small a space as one short section thou art freely willing fairly to distinguish them into two

yea further yet that thou dost not judge these two to be one it may appear plainly to thy self or any that are free to peruse the places in the
and
sections of the same first chapter for if thou didst then in the enjoyment of the one thou wouldest be satisfied as judging thy self consequently enjoying the other but that thou art not in any wise for howbeit by thy own confession there sect
capellus grants thee that the full enjoyment of the saving doctrine of the scripture is yet to be had or obtained by such as look chiefly after that let the letter be never so corrupted yet thou art at no hand content with this but piteously pinest after something else which is not this saving doctrine of the scripture nor the doctrine in it but another thing from which this contained doctrine is distinguished and that is the scripture it self which thou judged thou hast not notwithstanding thou hast its doctrine unless thou have the letter or writing also and that so exactly and entire without alteration and ablation that not a tittle of it nor undefined span alphabet be found lacking these are thy words
sect
nor is it enough to satisfie us that the doctrines mentioned are preserved entire every tittle and undefined span alphabet in the scripture in that writing see sect in the undefined span alphabet which we have must come under our care and consideration and to say the truth as thou putest a difference between the scriptures of truth and the truth written of in the scriptures sometimes as ever do so it is the scriptures of the truth more then the truth it self of which they are the scriptures that thou mostly scrawlest for in those thy scriptures for them which yet as is said above are not more for in shews and words then in deed and in truth they are against them nor is it the most substantial parts of that bare letter that thou wranglest for so much as for the more accidental parts thereof viz the points trivial tittles and undefined span alphabet so then it is concluded hitherto on both hands first by thy self as well

as by me that the scripture and its doctrine are not one but two several businesses whereof the first viz the scriptures are the subject matter so contended about between thee and the quakers as for t.d he draws his neck out of the coller here and after he had engaged me to discourse it publickly with him whether the scripture were the word of god or not and at the dispute desiring to know what held about it when he heard how on the quakers behalf declared what we meant by the scriptures viz the undefined span alphabet the writing the undefined span alphabet viz the letter and that we onely deny that denomination of the word of god to that not to the undefined span alphabet or word or doctrine or truth of god written therein he gave us the question without more ado saying thus you cannot believe us to be so simple surely as to affirm the scriptures in that sense the word of god but we mean the matter contained in the writing whether that be our rule of faith and life
of his first pamp which subject matter or doctrine and truth contained in the writing and testified to in it which was before ever the writing was and is as to the substance of it eternally and unchangeably the same christ the word the wisdom righteousnesse of god the war truth life both to day and for ever we never denyed to be the word and rule and foundation and what ever else i.o and the whole school of our english scribes do ignorantly and falsly say the scripture is though we are mistaken by most as denying the holy matter it treats of so to be but the matter is not the writing or the scripture but that which is onely written in it but the outward written letter or scripture much more the book in which the writing is which i.o is so busy for and for every point written title and undefined span alphabet this not onely we deny to be the word of god but all our rash reproachers of us as denying the scripture to be the word when we come to their faces are fain to fall in and deny the same with us also so christopher fowler after a long hot publick dispute at reading with e.b and my self upon this question whether the scripture be the word of god or no in which he contended a great while together it was at last confessed openly and plainly before all the people and magistrates there present that the scripture or writing and know not what else is properly and truly the scripture but the writing is not the word of god after which concession of c.f they would hear no longer dispute but the quakers were driven out of doors
but i.o standeth stifly to it that the word of god is the proper name of the scripture and even of every tittle and undefined span alphabet of it against the quakers for that the truth and doctrine of it or of christ declared in it is spiritual powerful saving perfect so that cursed will he be that adds to or detracts from it no quaker will deny and to fight for the perfection and integrity of that with them is but to fight without an adversary

howbeit i.o when thy brains as it were begin to crow as they often do like a man in a maze thou fetchest another turn back again upon the wheel and as inconsiderately as contradictorily to thy self thou blendest and confoundest these two sundry things that were before so severed by thy very self into one again so that as the two sticks aforesaid became one in the prophets hands so these two that were sometime put asunder and with thy own hand inscribed with different titles are joyned indentically

intituled denominated each of other as synonymous of two that stood divided made one individual of two sticks become one under thy own hand which writes of the writing and the thing written as of one and in its handling of them handles and feels no such matter of distinction between the scripturam and the scriptum the literam scriptam and the rem or doctrinam or veritatem scriptam the undefined span alphabet the undefined span alphabet and the undefined span alphabet the scriptiunculam verbi de verbo and the verbum scriptum the letter or vvriting and the doctrine or truth written the scripture of or concerning the law light gospel and vvord of god and the law light gospel and vvord of god it self of which the scripture is but a true writing or declration

yea whereas in that one single section lastly cited tr
ch

thou makes distinction in thy sound no lesse then four times between them first the vvritings and the doctrine secondly the writing and the doctrine thirdly the book and the truth fourthly the book and the faith in the very section immediately foregoing viz sect
which is as small as this thou all things well considered as they stand therein almost if not altogether as frequently dost confound them and write as if with thee they were as one for besides thy stiling the undefined span alphabet the undefined span alphabet the writing or scripture which is the total subject treated on in that section by these names viz the prophecy of scripture the word of prophesie the written vvord the word of god and thy loud lying in saying that undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet is above fifty times in the new testament put absolutely for the word of god not proving it to be so put so much as once not being able sure am to prove it to be half so often if thou couldest as shall shew elsewhere prove it so to be put an hundred fifty times all that would prove nothing to thy chief purpose which utter untruth must be more talk't with in another place thou twice there makest one of them as explanatory onely of thy mind and of what thou meanest by the other in these terms viz the writing or written word the undefined span alphabet it self or which is there more conjunctive then disjunctive the doctrine as written also thou makest the one but explicatory of the other in many other places viz ep ded
tr
ch


and ex

where thou writest of them not as of two but conjunctim as of one and the self same thing thus scripturam sacram seu verbum dei scriptum the scripture or written word of god sacred letters the written word

so incogiaant art thou as not onely both to divide into two and confound again into one these two distinct subjects viz the scripture and the word of god the writing and doctrine of christ therein declared within so small a compass as the space of two small sections standing both together but thou both dividest and confoundest them within the little corner of one single sentence witnesse the last clause of the twelfth section of the first chapter of thy treatise above cited where thou expressest thy self thus viz not onely the doctrine in it but the undefined span alphabet it self or the doctrine as written is from god as his word for so thou meanest still by that term from god in the first part of which the doctrine written in the scripture and the scripture it self are made two in the latter the scripture the doctrine written as written in it are made one which is the same doctrine

still as well when considered as written as when considered as not written and is neither more nor lesse of god whether written or not written and under both these notions a distinct thing from the writing evermore if the serpent can hansomly and fairly twine himself out here from the just censure of a self confounder let him scape this once and in this one thing for me but if he cannot do it without dawbing and dribling and shuffling and shifting and cutting and lying against the light within then let him hang there for me in his fetters of darknesse till he learn to speak without confusion for know not how in a way of honesty to help him out or take him down

having shewed what truly and properly the scripture is and what we the quakers intend and i.o also if we may take him as meaning what he mostly sayes by that term scripture when we deny it to be what thou contend'st it to be and pleadest against us for as its proper name viz the word of god
come next to those base abuses put upon us and false matters charged against us partly by t.d in his first pamphlet but principally by thee i.o as concerning our carriage toward the scriptures principally in thy latine legend wherein thou lyest more at liberty then in thy two english pieces of emptinesse and the more securely by how much thou seemest to thy self at least to lye more hidden or more obscurely out of the reach of their rebuke whom thou reproachest in that latine language then in the other insomuch that by thy own speeches we may conclude that thy whole work as relating to the quakers which is fronted but fronti nulla fides with pro scripturis adversus fanaticos for the scriptures against the fanaticks with which new the quakers by many more besides thy self who arbitrio diabolico wast one of the first imposers of it on that truly enlightned people begin now to be abusively branded seems to be designed more to the sporting thy own and thy schoolfellowes spightful spirits by playing upon the quakers in secret in your dark divinity cels among your selves then either to convince them to their faces of such errors as thou erroneously accusest them of or by thy crude theological disputations determinations tumultuarie sane fatis conscriptas as thou callest them ad lectorem to confute the quakers plainly and openly before plain people witnesse thy own saying to the like effect which shall first enter at as it lies in thy little latine lecture ad lectorem

j.o
the fanaticks or with thee the quak who are in these dayes most notable in their errors and foolishnesse we here principally assault
but no man could be deemed to dote so much as my self if aimed at the convincing of them by what here write

sith they no more understand the speech we here use then we at any time can perceive that indigested sound of words void of all sound sense whereby they when they speak seem to noise it out to not onely one another but all others also ex
sect
they the quakers are well nigh all unlearned and skild no further then their mother tongue

rep the more shame for thee i.o if the quakers be all so unlearned and utterly unintelligent in the latine tongue as thou sayest that thou talkest therein against them as thou dost and chargest them with much more error in doctrine and evil in life then will ever be made good against them by thy self or any of thine abetrours or stand approved for truth while the world stands among spiritually understanding and honest minded men when they come to be divested as hereby they are to be our of that disguise thou dressest them our in to thy iunior ieerers at christs own image which is seen upon them
was it not enough for thee to have belved them in english as no lesse then twice ore thou hast done in thy epistle dedicatory of thy doings to thy reverend friends the prebends and students in divinity in that society so called of ch church col in oxford where thou wast lately dean but quo jure divino yet know not but thou must likewise needs lay at them and lye in ambush and talk and take on against them in a tongue wherein if thy surmise of their vniversal ignorance of thy latine lyes had been as sound as it seemed to be they had been left not onely uncapable to do ought in their own defence in the mid'st of thy many mischievous accusations but also insensible of any at all or of who it was that hurt them with the sharp which our of the same devils bow with t.d in his thou shootest at randome at them in that thy divine piece of lying divination

art thou not in this one of those to whom the wo is isa
that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord whose works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us whose turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay art thou not herein as like one of the old bastardly broods viz the and ashdodites zach

that were adversaries to the true israel of god yea as like samballat and tobia as ever thou canst look who with the rest of their against the lords work that of the builders of ierusalem that removed the babylonish rubbish in order to the repairing of breaches the restoring the pure primitive truth the building of the old wastes out of the ruines and and the laying the foundations of many generations
said much what to the same tune as thou dost of the neh
they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease sure thou wast doubtful of being cal'd to by the quakers and conscious to thy self of thy own uncapablenesse to clear thy self in thy false accusations of them as denyers despisers sleighters of gods word and the scriptures hadst thou floured

them so sowlly and charged them so falsly in english as thou dost in latine and therefore as the laws made for english people to be ordered judged and tryed by that the lawers may prey the more perfectly upon their purses are laid up out of poor peoples sight in obscure terms long scroles and latine screel scrawls so thou chosest to be a barbarian to the quakers as they seem to be to thy self who art lost so far in hebrew greek and latin as not to know plain english and to talk to thy barbarous brotherhood against them in a language they as thou thoughest understand not rather then to talk to them in a known tongue about that enmity to the word of god and the scripture which thou inditest them at your high commission as guilty of but very unjustly for

as blindly as thou judgest we deny and carelesly forget the scriptures because we like sheep are silent in the light and not whining for it among the swine that seed no higher then on the empty husk yet we have not so foregone it but that according to christs promise to such as are in the spirit iohn
upon new occasion what ever we have read in it of the mind of christ of old is by that spirit brought a new to our remembrance and we know so much by it that even it now the word it speaks of is put into their mouths as their chiefest strength shall be excellently useful and used by both the tongues and pens of very babes and sucklings to still and stop the mouths of such adversaries to the truth and the light and the letter also as thou yet art who talkest utterly against the scripture in thy talking for it and pluckest it down while thou placest it above the light and by all thy proof less provings of the letter to be as the light it pleads for and thou against onely is a self evidencing light and power hast in truth proved thy own undertakings in that behalf to be a piteous plain self evidencing piece of great weaknesse and greater darknesse and many more uses are to be made of the letter yet as well as to beat the abusers of the scripture and the livers besides it with their own weapon of which more anon in its place and if we knew it not in the light as we do yet from the very letter we are well aware that the burthen of base born moab is near to come upon him and the night wherein of moab must be cut off and brought to silence and the night wherein of moab is to be cut off and brought to silence and that the time is near to come wherein as the saints are now silent in light before him who keepeth their feet that they do not slide so the wicked whose way is a slipery places in the dark will be driven on till they fall therein and shall at last be silent in darknesse for ever and bowl within themselves but no more so loudly against the light for by strength shall no man prevail isa

nor worse nor better then thus is the case with thee i.o and those sons of belial that wonder after thee nor is it any otherwise with thee and thy wondrous work which thy own heart head and hands have not only wrought and wrote but brought forth also into the world against the quakers wherein but especially in that last fourfold latine fardel which thy two former falling into one with it flows with them in one floud of folly and falshood wherein hoping having lap't thy self close up in the fig leaves of that little learning and logick that is used therein thou liest hid out of the sight of the quakers whose light thou deemest not large enough to lay hold on thee in that syllogistical siege thou there layest and those logical lurking holes in which thou lyest in a learned leagure against them thou adventurest more securely then thou durst well do in thy smooth english sermons to ease thy self of thy adversaries and avenge thee on thine enemies the quakers whom thou art afraid of though they are friends to thee and to the best thats in thee which is not of thee more then thou art or to it or to thy self
and being in a tumultuous hurry in hideous haste in the heat of iealousie which makes all look yellow in the height of anguish and such like mistiness together thou runnest over hedge and ditch not minding so much as the path of common reason equity honesty or truth not regarding any guide or rule to direct thy course by whether the light or the letter or as to thy disputation the line of logick it self which two last thou pretendest at least to be led by but in reality art led in a certain muddiness of minde reapse besides them all till as canis festinans caecos parit catulos thou hast brought forth not only a bundle of lyes and abuses of the quakers but also a business as full of learned blindness as most that ever have read of no bigger bulk howbeit thou grantest thy self a dispensation to over come all thou disputest with in thy disputation sith be it never so full of groapable darkness even to thy friends and fellows who will see and say nothing yet its laid up close and safe from the sight of thy antagonists the quakers within the linnen shrowd of a dark language so that the quakers cannot know any of all this for poor deluded fanatical silly souls they quoth i.o no more understand that language which we here make use of then we naturalists can comprehend that hidden nonsensical alias spiritual sound of words in which they seem to gape it out not only to all others but each to other in their discourses thus like the woodcock which having hid his head in a hole so that he seeth nobody thereby gathers that nobody seeth him thou judgest of such whose lives are hid from thee with christ in god that thy life and lyes likewise are hid from them yet there are some and for ought thou knowest not a few among the quakers who have been where thou art though where they now are thou canst never come but thorow a true death to thy own

whence hath this man these things he pretends too this boldness to teach us having never learn't at our schooles being never brought up at our nurseries of learning and religion and such like

but miserably wretched and deluded men that ye are ye little consider though the old priests and scribes as bad as they were took knowledge of such a thing in peter and iohn acts
that as outwardly unlearned and ignorant men as the quakers seem to you to be yet they have been with iesus from whom they have learned that by looking to him in his own light which all your meer sublunary literature can never lead you into the knowledge of even that hidden wisdom of god in a mystery which the princes of this world are not acquainted with that crosse of christ the wisdom power righteousnesse image and glory of god which is foolishnesse to them that ye glory in your faculties of disputing in form and mood and figure over the quakers as a sort of rusticks and disorderly disputers unruly and vain talkers because they are not regulated as your own blinded people are in all things implicitly by the rules and wordly rudiments of you renowned rabbies but ye forget that the lord hath rejected the scribe and disputer of this world and will confound and make foolish and bring to nought all his strong and wise and mighty matters that are by the weak foolish base abject contemptible things that are not and by stammerring lips and another tongue then they wot of and by precept upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little make the drunkard of ephraim stagger and stumble and go backward and fall and be broken and snared and taken and weary these vain wise wildasses out of their academical niceties and punctilio's out of their accute astutenesse and astute accutenesse out of their witty wiles and wicked wrestlings against the truth by a foolish nation that are even as no people in their eyes
ye tell the world that these people know not the law and are accursed as your did saying do you see any of the rulers of the pharisees believe as they do they are un'earned and unstable a giddy headed people that wrest the scriptures to their own destruction but ye heed not how christ tells the scribes that were as well skilled in searching into the scripture as your selves that they erred and knew not the scriptures nor the power of god and how even ignorant and unlearned peter himself as to that science of yours falsely so called or wisdome of the flesh which is ever enmity against god and is never subject to his law nor can be speaks of another kind of un'earn'd and unstable ones then those ye count so who are a thousand fold more spiritually discerning then your selves that being out of the light and spirit in which paul and holy men gave them forth wrest both pauls epistles that are hard to be understood by the learned'st of our and also other scriptures to their own ruine

the quakers preach christ his light and crosse the power of god the wisdom of god to the iew outwardly a stumbling block and foolishnesse to the greek the quakers know not the originals say they how can they expound and open scriptures they know not the language we here use quoth i.o whose lyes are most in latine against the quakers who busies

himself about the of the book and tangles and turmoyls himself in tedious tattle about the external text about the integrity of the hebrew the greek but ye say know not what is talked of in that text it self ye so much talk of when it tells of a time wherein the eyes of all israel as of one man shall be toward the lord who will bend judah for himself and fill the bow with ephraim and raise up the sons of sion against the sons of greece and make them as the sword of a mighty man in his hand yea who so blind about the scripture it self as well as about the things therein written as the great scripture searching scribes and scholastick scriblers thereupon who come not at all to christ himself whom the scriptures testifie of that they might have light and life who never at any time hear either his or the fathers voice or see his shape so far are they from coming forth into his likenesse or image which in their own imaginations these spiritual men of god so called pretend to appear in more then any others

now as to the many frivoulous flouting phrases and new fangled nicknames wherewith thou who bearest christs name more then his nature like the old heathen enemies to the truth dost cover its true christian friends as it were with wild that looking on them under that likenesse name and notion of deceivers destroyers lyars hypocrites horrid cursed diabolical blasphemers the dogs of your flocks may be hereby encouraged and set on to run the more greedily on to tear and worry them these will all reflect upon thy self the envious exerter of them and lye with no little load like a talent of lead upon thy conscience and sink thee down among the rest of the uncircumcised in lips into sore condemnation when thou awakest to behold him who now cometh in myriads of his saints to convince and iudge all ungodly sinners for all the hard speeches they have ungodly spoken against him in his saints and servants whose righteousness is of the lord and whose heritage it is to condemne every false blasphemous and unruly tongue that as thine doth riseth up in judgement against them
and as for us the reproach of christ is greater riches to us then the treasures of england which ye are glorying in and gaping after nevertheless shall here have a few words with thee about some few of them as well as about the lyes that under them thou rellest of us
thou ventest thy venome against us under those two now vulgar names of quakers and fanaticks on this wise


the second part of the question concerning the proper name of the scripture relates to our fanaticks who from that trembling wherewith they fain themselves to be shaken in their holy services or rather the power of that evil spirit by which in very deed they are shaken are commonly called quakers

reply as for that holy duty it self of quaking and trembling at the word of god which as blind a guide and bruit a beast as thou art in speaking evil of what thou knowest as also of what thou knowest not thou both ownest and acknowledgest the holy men of god were taken with of

old when moved to utter his word as it came to them witness thy own words pag
viz the coming of the word to them filled them with dread and reverence of god hab
and also greatly affected even their outward man though we dare not be so desperate as to damne it all for diabolical as thou dost in these dayes in which god hath his prophets and his people as well as then yet we own it as thou in word dost and indeed as they did isa
and are as they by their brethren hated and cast out by you our brother christians in name for so doing which meer fleshly brotherhood who hate us and cast out our name as evil for his names sake shall be ashamed for it before him that appears to our joy and when ierusalem hath first drunk her part as she is now a doing ye shall drink the dregs of the cup of trembling with the devils whose portion trembling is for all ye believe the history as they also do and wring them out together with all the wicked of the earth

and as we own the thing so saving all your ironical tauntings of us therewith which we deny as that which ye even of god must be denied for we own the name when used in his fear as that which is both arbitrio iure divine imposed by god himself as their proper right on his own people whom himself from that holy qualification of trembling at his word even thereby as by a peculiar character denominates isa
and distinguishes from all other people that are found quaking and trembling mostly at the word of man whom his saints have ceased from whose breath is in his nostrils so that if the word of man earthly powers princes parliaments go forth for such or such a kind of christianity religion worship order or form of ecclesiastical doctrine or discipline they all priests and people and the nations that fear not god by strait stand stupified quaking and trembling and fall down worshipping for fear of the furnace the quakers at gods word only excepted whatever golden image the king of babilon pleases to set up and impose on them to how down to as to name and thing then we own that of quaking and trembling but dare not like thy self who ownest and yet defamest it corrupt our selves in what we know nec tutum est ludere cum sacris neither is it a safe matter for such a high professor as thou i.o goest for to jeast and fleere so as thou dost about such holy matters as quaking and trembling at the word of god which thou must come to know nearer home then ever yet when that word nigh in the heart thou so sowlely fallest on comes once to be felt in thee as an hammer breaking thy rocky heart to pieces and to flame forth in thee as a fire and a spirit of burning under the pot whose filthy scum boyls in it against the truth and is not yet purged away when thou comest to know moses of whom thou pratest so much a little better then yet thou dost thou shalt say exceedingly fear and quake they self as well as he with whom thou must tremble on mount sinai heb at that voice of the trumpet and that terrour of the lord and that blacknesse and darknesse and tempest which attends it before thou come near mount sion and to rest in the hill thereof as much as in an empty sound of words thou art mounting up thither afore thy time

i.o
but this dread and terrour which satan strove to imitate in his filthy tripodes and undefined span alphabet was peculiar to the old testament and belonged to the paedogogy thereof the spirit in the declaration of the new testament gave out his mind and will in a way of more liberty and glory the manner of it related more to that glorious liberty in fellowship and communion with the father whereunto believers had then an accesse provided them by jesus christ

rep that the devil may and doth strive to imitate the things of god deny not yea there's scarse any outward appearance or form that the power of god puts it self forth in but the power of the evil one in man strives apishly to imitate and make the meer likenesse and image of it but these images and imitations are made among the magicians and wisemen of egypt who are gone out from gods counsel the light and power of god in the conscience into the meer imaginations of their own vain minds and foolish hearts leaning to their own benighted understandings but not among these who leaving their own wisdom learn only at the lips of christ who leads even fools that love him into the substance it self and that wisdom which makes wise to salvation
tis true that as iannes and iambres withstood moses by imitating what he did by the finger of god and acting outwardly so as he as far as they could till they were forced to confesse they could now fainedly follow no further and in a seeming shew did the same by their enchantments
so tis now the saints pray so do the sinners the saints fast so do the sinners the saints preach of a gospel a kingdom to come so do the serpents the saints meet so do the hypocrites the saints worship so do the idolaters the saints in the power and spirit of god professe to be godly and holy so do the zealous sorceters in words who bewitch the people that they cannot believe and obey the truth and their several seduced societies which have undefined span alphabet the form of godlinesse denying the power thereof
and as it is true that as the quakers tremble at gods word so that the power of gods voice which shaketh the cedars of lebanon when heard as well as the lower shrubs oftimes greatly affecteth the outward man so the devil may cause some of his deluded ones to seem only to do the like but what of all this scillicet because there is something done in deceit therefore nothing now done in truth some quaking is of the devil therefore none of god himself
this is the sum of i.o sayings of all the quakers in grosse if not learn henceforth i.o to take forth the prelious from the vile as gods prophets do who are as his mouth ier and not to jumble these together in one as hitherto thou hast done till then tell thee from the quakers so called that faining and being driven by the devil thou fatherest on us we are far from and deny it as one of the many lyes the devil drives thee to defame us with who are in the truth which the devil abode not in whose works with himself and his lyes and that deceit which is of him and dwells in thee we deny and defie also for ever

and now whereas thou talkest of only liberty and glory and fellowship with the father in these dayes of the new testament and such quaking

trembling terrour dread as greatly affects the outward man as a matter belonging to them of old only to the iewish paedagogy as if the word must come to you now in a smoother manner then to gods servants and prophets heretofore

herein thou talkest as if the time of all such trouble terrour dread and trembling at hearing of the word of god as usually affected the outward man and was in the prophets was all perfectly past and men should see no more of that in the world among the servants of the lord from that time and forward wherein christ after the flesh was outwardly incarnated crucified and risen again from the dead and all the appearances of the lord to his apostles prophets messengers ministers and servants whom he sends forth on his errand into the world now a dayes are only in liberty glory dreaming pleasantly in thy dark mind of ease rest peace and familiarity with the dreadful god before thy time damning down the rough severe troublesome terrible trembling spirit doctrine and ministry of the quakers to thee ward and thy serpentine generation of vipers that would fain flee the wrong way when ye are warned thereof from the newes of a wrath yet to come to your lifelesse formes and and false sandy sickle foundations literal fained pretences bare bible bulwarls selfish fastings prayers praisings preachings misty empty pithlesse and poor professions as a doctrine of devils as a ministration wherein either fictitiously or rather really they are acted surpriz'd by the devil with trembling in their holy services ex s.i as they said of iohn that came fasting and reproving
iudging and threatning laying an axe to the root of their fair leafy tree and flourishing formal prosessings of the old prophets words and writings and pretences to abraham as his children and moses as his disciples and the scripture as the scribes and openers of it and telling of wrath to come upon them and unquenchable fire to burn them up as chass this man hath a devil away with him give us a ministry that will speak comfortably to ierusalem seers that will see better things for sion that shall answer the messengers of the nations that enquire of them the lord hath founded sion tis babylon that is to be confounded ye quakers ye seers flee ye far away hence to rome to papists iesuites iewes turks heathens among whom many quakers have been but few or none of our that know of but come not hence with your thundring words of iudgement laid to the line and righteousnesse to the plummet and laying waste the high places of israel and the sanctuaries of israel with the sword of the lord this our land of israel ought not to bear these words tis disturbance tumultuousnesse and conspiracy against the pious magistracy and the godly ministry in the midst of it prophesie no more such rough things at bethel they are not right things here prophesie to us placentia prophesie smooth things alias deceits we are the preists of bethel the house of god

but alas poor man thou art far enough from the new testament or covenant yet which is a gospel a covenant of light which thou art so far from that thou fightest against it thou thinkest thy judgement is over past and the old testament a thing that thou hast learned long ago but thou art not come so near to the sharp paedagogy of it yet as thou must do so far art thou from the glorious liberties of the new thy words are true enough the word under the new comes in a way of more liberty and glory but its no newes to hear high priests speak truths which themselves know not thou art at best but an old testament talker of the new and one thats come truly yet under the tuition of neither as for the new the word comes under it in liberty and glory but not to old testament spirits doctors scribes and pharisees they see not clearly so much as moses face much lesse the glory of god in the face of iesus condemnation is yet to come from christ himself first to such as these as well as from moses iohn yea christ whose friendliness to publicans and sinners as a physitian was found fault with by such friday fasting pharisees as this age is filled with as much as iohns austerenesse was found in iohns rough spirit camels hair garment and astonishing appearance to them that went about to murder him in his inward ministry and testimony within themselves and then they said of him too as of iohn thou hast a devil ioh

and that what with these things and chiefly the peoples being so eminently perplexed with false prophets both as to their number and subtilty that they could not well discern aright between gods word and that which was only pretended so to be and so became guilty of unbelief and rebellion against god not submitting to what they spake in his name it alwayes so sell out that scarce any prophet that spake in the name of god had any approbation from the church of dead stones in whose dayes he spake matth

thus much i.o may learn from these words which are mostly his own that it was alwayes so heretofore and how it should be otherwise in the latter dayes of this formal christian church called christendom then he sayes it was in the latter daves of that iewish church both which national churches say they are iewes christians and are not but lye and are the synagogue of satan he cannot see that will not purposely look besides the scripture which intimates to us a necessity of the innumerable multitude of false prophets by which people must be perplexed from submitting to the testimony of gods true ones that now go forth from him to witnesse against the other since it sayes so long since as it was written that many antichrists and false prophets were even then already gone forth into the world which as according to christs praediction matth

so then by reason of the many subtilties and serpentine insinuations of the many false prophets in these last dayes of the gentile christian church in name not nature tis now as twas ever of old that the true prophets of the lord whom he reproves the other by are look'd on as fanaticks fools and mad bare brain'd fellows king

that do but pretend and seem to themselves to see that they do not and make themselves prophets and are often punish'd as a sort of giddy guides with stocks stones prisons and such kind of rough reproofs as the false prophets the shemaiahs or dreamers which speak lying words in the lords name which he commanded them not suggest as most surable for the true seers to the officers whether vice chancellors chief priests or earthly powers that are as the beast that bears her is the subordinate willing executioners of the clergy

now befalling all nations where they are and the wells from whence those legions of learned unlearned ones to whom the vision of all is as a book sealed have sprang and to whom all people have leaned as their leaders till they have utterly lost the way to life and the right eyes of those which the sword of the lord now comes upon till it be night unto them that they shall not divine and till they sha'l be utterly darkned

and this declare not as one that am utterly against that outward inferiour furniture or lower sort of literature whereon ye live and feed till ye surfet and for having but a little of which for some that pretend to very much have not overmuch of that and as much abuse that little they have more in defiance then in defence of truth ye reckon on your selves as exceedingly inriched nay if most of you had more of it then you have it were not much the worse would you use it better then you do and were ye as rich and learned as ye are in that in the best kind of learning which the light within leads to and ye fight against and the measure of gods gift of grace in your own hearts that brings salvation with it to all that submit to be taught by it teaches viz to deny ungodlinesse and worldly lusts and to liue godly righteously and soberly in this present world as little of which learning and life is to be found among young academical self
admirers as among any people upon earth among whom there is whether magna or parva cura linguarum major or minor artium will not say nor is it much material so long as what is of the lord most expected lies most neglected but may safely say not maxima but minima pietatis
but speak it as one not a little lamenting over our nurseries of learning and religion and not a little grieved to see how little of god and godlinesse in the power of it is either seen or sought after by those seers and formal seekers but those of outward letters and writings whereof some are as bad rotten poysonsome false and foolish as othersome are good wholsome true sound and solid in the best of which yet without the light which universally they hate and look askew at the life of god can never be found and to see how little yet our nations supposedly learned leaders have learn'd of that mistery christ iesus within themselves whereby to become any other then ignes fatui or false leaders to the whole land which hath been wholly caused to erre by them and hath been led of them to its own destruction
yea this lamentable and shall be for a lamentation of lamentations with which must make a little out here to lament against you ye nursing mothers so called to the church of god both in this nation and throughout christendom that there is none among all the sons which to the vast expending and exhausting of her earthly treasure and the very quintessence of all her carnal things upon them both in her vniversities and in all her parishes when remov'd from thence she hath nourished and that is found able by the spirit which onely does it to minister spiritual things truly to her or in requital of her who hath so inriched them for it the other way to enrich her with any true lasting heavenly treasure or to measure and tale back again to her even as well in her protestant and more reformed as in her popish and more deformed states any other then such trash wood hay and stubble as is now falling before the fire

and that by all the most learned labours of her most learned rabbies doctors and students in theology and clergy of what sort soever the rest of her children call'd christians have not learn'd so much as to know christ and themselves much lesse christ in themselves so far as make them honest true holy just sober meek pure loving gentle merciful pitiful peaceable patient temperate and after his own image which is the end of all learning ministries ministrations and doings that pertain ad intra and ad extra too to christian religion which christ or image of god ad intra and ad extra also who are not come to witnesse in and on themselves know not yet christ the mystery the hope of glory and cannot prove themselves upon due examination to be in the faith or any other in the sight of god then reprobates

and that by and from her priests and her prophets whose own eyes are not yet annointed with that they may see that have took upon them to be her supream guides into goodnesse and took many millions of money for many ages and generations upwards to make other men learned in the truth to direct them into righteousnesse and holinesse the hands of evil have been strengthened so that none hath returned perfectly from his wickednesse but such evil fruits as darknesse ignorance blindnesse bloodinesse uncleanness drunkennesse and all sorts of ungodlinesse and profanenesse is gone forth into all her lands so that a little of that honest learning how to live godly righteously and honestly in this present world that is now found in abundance among poor plain countrey rusticks and russet rabbies as some university doctors and divines witnesse doctor featley have derisorily denominated the mechanicks that meddle with expounding scripture amounts to more then all that great learning little equity lesse honestly and least godlinesse that is found among the nursing fathers and nursing mothers of them all
and this is lamentable and a lamentation with which must here lament not onely over all christendom in general but over these protestant parts of it also where popery is so abjured that men spend their money on their pretended feeders for that which is not the bread of life but light heartlesse branne that is measured out to them at a high rate too the lord knows out of the barren brain of their bruitish pastors who have not sought the lord in his own light but at the most in that meer letter that gives not the life of which letter they are the ministers for means too and not of the spirit whereupon as the lord sayes ier
they shall not prosper but all their flocks must be scattered in order to which the noyse of the bruit is already come and a great commotion out of the north to lay their cities desolate as a den of dragons

that howbeit their deluders cry out against the quakers who freely undelude men as poor deluded fanatical yet the poor people are most miserably couzened cheated and deluded by their blind guides that see little themselves into the marrow and mystery of spiritual matters and not standing in the counsel of god given out by his light in their own consciences never come to hear his word coming to them within from his own mouth and not hearkening to what god himself saith in them as the true prophets did hab
never come into the true vision of him or his will but run and say he saith because they find it written he said so or so to others

when they never heard him speaking it in themselves and so never profit the people at all as god said of old such should not

they sit as the old pharisaical scribes did who heard not at any time the voyce of god nor saw his shape in the of their own imaginations searching the scriptures and looking in them for the eternal life which onely testifie of it but come not unto christ in whom onely they testifie it is for in him is the life say they and his life is the light of men that they may have his life in themselves and from it onely minister unto others and so such food for their souls and rayment and riches and gold and as they have which is none of that which christ whose light within or inward councel they reject against themselves counsels all laodicean like angels and churches to buy of him such lifelesse stuff they give should say sell in as good words and fair speeches as they can put it off withal to simple people for outward food and rayment and gold and silver and riches as they have pertaining to the belly and the body

so the bodies of shepherds are oft full and fat but the souls of poor sheep pine and starve for all that

and that the souls of poor people should ever come possibly to be made any richer towards god then they are while they stand under the droppings onely of the lips of such linguists as are no higher learned then their nursing mothers teach them cannot expect if nil dat quod in se non habet be true sith the chief spirituals that those spiritual men have themselves who learn to be teachers of religion to others no where but at the vniversities are but carnal natural animal literal such as without the light and spirit and living word of god within for that in the name of his there i.o to whom its vouchsafed of god sayes he but say of the devil so to do fights against as fiercely as he can is obtained out of many books and writings the best of which is the bible and the naked letter of it by the improvement of a meer animal understanding which the letter of the bible it self also sayes perceives not the things of the spirit

nor can expect as the case is with them that they themselves who there are taught to be gospel· teachers should attain to any more then such a shallow speculation and thin external theory of those things as they have or should ever enter into the depths of gods kingdom whilest in the depth of the serpents subtilty they are beguiled so far from a single hearted search after the truth in the simplicity thereof as it is from jesus the light of the world by the beams thereof made manifest in their own hearts that taking it for granted aforehand that all that and no other then that is truth which is held forth and told for truth in the times of their residence at those foresaid fountains which are not steadily running one way neither but to and fro as the tide turns and running several wayes at several seasons they stave off all that as heresie at a distance which is handed to them any other ways no more doubting but that that must be error which at the of divinity is pleaded against then they do that that is truth they there plead for so as is qui nil dubirat nil capit inde boni these confident blind bold iuniors that visit the academies for this end

that they may become for a livelihood preachers of the faith to others never doubting that to be the true faith and truth which they find professed in their times set themselves on work to study how to defend it at a venture against all hereticks before they have either found or felt it to be truth within themselves and stand steadfastly tempered still according to the present temper of the grand seniors of their respective nurseries who temper themselves ever according to the temper of the times and the rulers that happen to be in them whence it comes to passe for the most part that as there's like prince like priest so like priest like people in these northern islands where after some certain time of standing and studying in the vniversity these hasty hirelings run abroad before the word of command be given them from the mouth of the lord and settle themselves up and down till the countrey swarmes with them like so many locusts successively supplying the waste places of such as either die in parishes or depart from one to another where there's a bigger boon ne detur vacuum that there be no place void or empty at any hand which is not more an abhoring to nature in general in rerum natura in the fabrick of the universe then tis to these natural mindes in bujusmodi rerum naturâ in the fabrick of their vniversity affairs

and sometimes so do they hasten on their own heads to be prophets and pastors for their own ends and livings sake upou which account being thereby capable of some parsonage or ecclesiastical emolument much more then for service sake to the gospel many younger brothers and poor mens sons are sent there to be educated that before their haughty heads are halt hatcht into any solid understanding of either themselves or the truth of god or their hearts so much as warmed into any way of wisdom from above they run like a company of green guls with shells on their heads and sow themselves under the earth for heaven they see not in such seats and soils as best like them and plant themselves for plants of the heavenly fathers planting they are not in parishes palaces and other places as chaplains and curates and then divide and divine out that divinity they have stor'd their heads and books withal by stealth of study out of the common stock of spirit stinting stuff which like a spring thats never drawn drier then twas at first remains the same still at the for the furnishing of all new comers behaving themselves so honourably or rather onerably in their respective bounds or circuits among the people of these nations of england scotland and ireland also whether they sayl by whole sale even by whole tuns at once that more like the pope in his peterdom then like peter who commanded the contrary they lord it over their stocks so as to live upon them whether they will of no and often without their leave if they can be licensed elsewhere set up their shop of books and go out and keep market in their parish once a week and sell one or two of their thoughts upon some text of scripture by a glasse full at a time at the rates of about twenty shillings a piece and which is most tyrannical force people too to buy their commoditie be it good or bad truth or errout right or wrong honest or counterfeit and which is worse yet without allowing any the liberty to try it in the publick market place or old where they hold it forth whereas all other and excepting

these mystical merchants give all their customers leave to try their wares and merchandize and leave them to their own choise whether they will buy it or no and which is worse yet when they have sold their sermons to them or read or said them over to them out of their notes they take them away along with them and leave them not to the people who are to pay for them per force when the time comes and which is undefined span alphabet illorum undefined span alphabet the prime piece of delusivenesse perhaps sell the sermons for as much more at another place at a funeral or some such like occasion whereas if any shoomaker should take the shoos or the sermons which he hath sold and sell them to another know what these men who call the quakers fanatical knaves as well as others would quickly be ready to account of them

and whereas a man may buy a whole bible for five shillings they sell some one verse of it a little set out and flourisht and amplified with no other trimming but their own fallible vain thoughts upon it for twenty shilllings which bible might serve a whole town to read in one chapter of which is worth twenty of their uncertain sermons or if men be minded to have sermons these nations are now so full of them that for groats one may buy twenty printed sermons of men whom they count more eminent then themselves which may serve to hear and read at home no lesse then twenty weeks together one of which sermons have more truth in them then either priests or people upon their principles of non perfection of holinesse and purging from sin in this life are like to practise as long as they live and till they practise what they know already its but labour lost pains taken time spent and money expended in vain to preach and hear in order to their knowing more sith whatsoever is known and remains undone does but adde to their condemnation
and thus not the quakers whom i.o calls poor and deluded for they grow rich in good works though spoil'd in goods and will never be more so spoild and deluded as they have been but seek to save others from being deluded by men made ministers with academical accomplishments and accoutrements who are the evil ones and seducers that way worse and worse rather then better and better for all the on reformation deceiving and deceived say not the quakers but the parish people are every way impoverishr and deluded being fed and enriched for their mony with nothing but mens fallible words and worthlesse thoughts in stead of the true living word and precious things of the living god
and yet neither will these parish people suffer themselves to be alwayes so bejaded are they are by the rabbies that ride them to ruine but rather when their eyes are a little further opened to see how they are posted on by their priests that love the wages of unrighteousnesse to defie the israel of god against the drawn sword in the hand of the lords angel messengers or ministers with balaams asse refuse to passe with them any further and open all their mouths as one man to rebuke the madnesse of their prophets
and as thou i.o sayest truly enough ex

of the overthrow of that ambitious and arrogant crew of the papal clergy so sav in ipsissimis verbis of the downfal of that intollerable insolency of our protestant clergy that have pusht them beside the saddle and setled themselves there in their steads

neither verily is become so bruitish as that they will alwaves bear those spiritual mountebanckly cheaters who for filthy lucres sake against the plain praecepts of christ the examples of all the saints the common principles of that very reason whereby we are men and of that common understanding that all men have by the light within indelebly implanted in their minds casting behind their backs the care of eternal salvation do endeavour by carelesse negligence to hold all men intangled in their enticing snares of idolatry in blindnesse and ignorance of the will of god and of their own duty to him

as then that of the popish priesthood which thou i.o speakest of will not so neither will the solly of this kingdom of priests that have more lately lorded it in their dominions proceed much further but be manifested to all men as the others was before them both yea as thou savest of thy so called poor deluded fanatical quakers
fanatici undefined span alphabet
so say of these poor deluding fantastical fanatici undefined span alphabet sunt erroribus stultitia bisce diebus notissimi quos hic inprimis aggredimur these fantastical seers whom here primarily plead against are in these dayes most notoriously known by their errours and foolishnesse already not to a few of their own former followers and will be to ten times as many more in the dayes that are immediately hereafter following
thy many taunting terms wherein thou both belyest flingest and quippest at the quakers being thus not in the same taunting or twitting way but in a way of true judgement turned upon thy self and thy own at them
shall more closely examine what thou falsely accusest us of more particularly as concerning our deportment toward the scriptures whom thou falsely declarest to be so grossely opposite thereunto as duely and deservedly to be denominated by those terms by which thou also miscallest us of fanatical
ep
undefined span alphabet ex

i.e haters of the scripture and to be rankt among the rudest reproachers of them in such words of thine as are hereunder repeated and replied to

i.o thou sayest satan in these dayes assaults the sacred truth of the word of god in its authority purity integrity or perfection especially in the poor deluded fanatical souls commonly called quakers ep
that to this sort of men the quakers it was not enough to joyn in with those in ages past who cast reproaches on the scriptures and approve of all the opprobrious speeches that have been cast out against them but they also rejoyce that the care of this matter viz of spoiling the holy scriptures of its proper name that glorious title of the

word of god is by satan confer'd upon them that they the quakers who would seem to bear away the bell from all as to the stout opposing of the perfection of the scriptures thou principally encounterest and as tis an honour to thee that god hath pleased to confer on thy unworthy self this task of fighting against those enemies of his word the quakers so what thou shalt perform in prosecution of this function thou oughtest to ascribe to his grace

reply
herein thou not onely shewest thy to be of that sort of men to whom it is not enough to joyn with those in ages past who cast reproaches on the hearers of the word of god and tremblers at his word isa

now in scorn called quakers and cast out by their brethren for his name sake as then they were and to be an approver of all the opprobrious speeches that are cast out against them by this adulterous and sinful generation who bend their tongues like bowes for lyes against the truth which lyes thou shouldest be a valiant reprover of but also to rejoyce that the care of this matter of fighting against the truest friends in the world to god and his word the quakers and of raising such reproaches false reports scandals and opprobrious speeches as the rabble of junior rabbies reproach them with is confer'd upon thee by the devil for thou egregiously belyest the quakers in this particular who deny not but purely and perfectly own all that authority purity integrity and perfection of the scriptures which the scriptures ascribe unto themselves and rob it not of any proper name or any title at all which by it self is either attributed or appropriated to it self as that of the word of god is not as is seen hereafter much lesse are they such enemies to the word of god or that sacred truth written of in the scriptures as thou most abusively and blasphemously belyest them to be that thou needest to stand up as thou dost in thy meer demications against them for the scriptures and the word of truth between which and the scriptures in which it is declared they divide aright so as to give its own proper name to each of these whilst ye divinity doctors in your deep dotage making no due distinction betwixt them for all your pretended friendship thereunto are found very enemies to them both
so that whereas thou who in other matters then this gloriest in thy own shame seem'st to glory in this function of fighting against the quakers as in some great grace peculiarly given of god to thy unworthy self more then any as if praemium strenuae contra trepidantium perfectionem ac oppositioni debitum nemini mortalium tibi praereptum velles thou seemest to thy self to bear the bell before all others in thy stout opposing of that innocent seed of god to which grace of his thou ascribest what ever relying on his help and assistance thou performest in thy function aforesaid conclude against thee to the contrary thus in short that tis satan himself who set thee at work against the quakers and helpt thee as well as he could and furnisht thee with many a lye both against the quakers and the truth and led thee in a meer fools paradise to prate with malicious words and speak evil of thou knowest not whom nor what and left thee to bewray such weaknesse folly and false hood as falls not at all from such as have help and assistance from god but ever flows from the father of lyes and his children with whom thou wilt have thy reward

j.o whatsoever the jewes whatsoever the papists have been bold at any time to utter in disgrace of the scriptures every whit of that these impure men the quakers stricken as twere with some direful inordinate motion or rapture both say and assert so that its a shame to relate the horrid and most foolish titles of books the chief vagrants and ringleaders of this flock being urged having spoken wickedly and blasphemously against the scriptures
what their common opiniin have thought good to set down as taken and collected from their own books and set conferrences held with them

reply here's a most palpable lye related of the quakers on whose behalf here openly professe against thee before the world that we own all those writings not only of moses and the prophets of the old but those of the apostles and evangelists also which are commonly called the scriptures of the new testament to be scriptures of truth written by holy men of god as those of the old also were as they were moved by the holy spirit whereas the iewes who own value study and stand for those of the old to this day as zealously as your selves in words do for both do malitiously and lyingly affirm them to be false fictitious and full of lyes
reply
whereas we say no such thing nay nothing at all in any disgraceful way of the scriptures but say only in words of truth and sobernesse that they are not to be so exceedingly adored and idolized by men as theyre by you who make them little lesse then all in all things to the church the papists speak much in disparagement of the scriptures in which we say they do but blasphemously babble against them viz
that they are inferrior to the humane traditions of their church or at least to the unerring breast of their ghostly holy father without whom opening and authorizing them they are of no more use nor authority then aesops fables and such like

reply
whereas thou art ashamed to relate the horrid foolish titles of the quakers books in proof of their blasphemies against the scriptures believe thats true indeed though all the rest are palpable lyes for if thou shouldest relate the titles of the quakers books in proof of the truth of this thy charge of them which is utterly false then thy lye which is plain enough already would be seen more plainly then it is for in all the titles of the quakers books that ever read who have read ten times more of them believe then thou hast done as have seen christ only exalted on the throne and the scripture owned in its place so never saw and am perswaded also thou never hast seen any thing written by the quakers that borders on the foresaid iewes and papists blasphemings of the holy scriptures and therefore as cannot much marvel at it that thou art ashamed to do it so do not much blame thee that it

doth so much shame thee as thou sayest to relate the most foolish of them

if it were true there was malice enough in thee i.o to provoke thee to have instanced some particulars in proof of this parcel of scandal to the fuller shame of the quakers whom to scandalize what thou canst is thy chief design and to have named those blasphemers and their books but pudet referre sayest thou am ashamed to relate thou art loath to be too punctual in thy proof lest it proving too short of thy charge the stain thou wouldest have stuck upon the truths friends should be stricken back upon thy self and the lye come to lye at thy own door for if sounded out too loudly and distinctly it might eccho and rebound home again to thee the author and so redound to thy dishonour so thou fold'st thy self like the serpent whose seed thou art in indefinite complexes or at least lapest thy self up in universals and darest not lay thy self out at length nor grow too far into particulars for dolus later in universalibus quae nunquam bene sentiuntur nisi ex particularibus suis as deceit lyes most securely and keeps best hid in universals which are not clearly perceived but by the particulars in which they exist so by being beheld in the said particulars both they and the lyes that lye often in them undiscerned come more unavoidably to be discryed

reply
whereas thou saiest thou thinkest meet to set down our opinion as collected out of our own books and speeches and accordingly dost declare what we hold as concerning the scriptures thou most plainly confutest thy self as to the lyes thou tellest of us for thy self acknowledgest of us that we own that the scriptures do contain a true

declaration of the will and mind of god proceeding from the spirit of christ inspiring the writers that thus far we are right and that we stand to this confession without any renouncing it only that we would have wholly rejected the scriptures without doubt but that things have not fell out according as we could wish do deny them to be the ordinary inalterable perfect and standing rule of gods worship and our obedience without the revelations of the spirit and such like and this sayest thou is the summe of these mens iudgements
which if it be where's the wicked blasphemy all this while wherewith thou chargest us for there's none as shall appear in the worst of this which yet thou settest down as gathered out of the quakers books and speeches which thou sayest bear blasphemous titles against the scriptures but pudet referre blush to set them down must answer all

these things do convict thee of telling many notorious lyes against the quakers even too many for a man to tell that calls himself a minister

of christ and though not all by very many which thou tellest in thy book some of which lyes yet left they should not be loud enough to come under every ordinary readers observation if told but once are either expresly or implicitly two or three times over related


the jewes papists and quakers differ among themselves it so falls out that they who in all other matters are most different in opinion conspire altogether in this blasphemy viz against the scriptures

the papists and enthusiastical fanaticks do perpetually war against each other they mutually devote each other to destruction
they are not acted by the same reasons but those for their traditions these for their enthusiasms and revelations contending tooth and nail and so like sampsons foxes with their tayles turned to each other bringing on the churches breadcorn they all attempt together very friendly to thrust down the holy scripture from its place
the papists do earnestly endeavour to detrude the scripture out of its proper place in the church our fanaticks tread in the same with them into which wickednesse those among the papists that are called the spiritually have led them the way
and elsewhere thou reckon'st us up among the rest as enemies of gods word and haters of the scriptures

reply
howbeit thou who in thy epistle pretendest it to be thy aim and intention in thy discourse to discover the reproach that is cast by many upon the scripture to its disparagement and to vindicate it therefrom dost as in most things else wherein thou bend'st at us discharge thy bow at a venture so as at random to rank us as joynt abettors with them in grosse in that one grosse and common cause of caluminating vilifying decrying denying the scriptures among atheists pagans new testament contemning iewes papists and the whole rabble of rude reproachers thereof whether in whole or part as if we were if not the ring leaders yet at least the of the of of what ever sort yet in this thou hast most grosly abused us and thy self also by thy false accusing and belying of us to the world in that particular and must most assuredly come into condemnation in

judgement for condemning the generation of the just for however thou of us to the causing of many to mistake us yet of a truth we are no such manner of people as thou wouldest make men believe we are but such as shall manifest our selves even in this present contest with thee for all thy perking up into a proud pretensive prate against us pro scripturis as if we stood in some deep defiance and thou against us in some eminent and more then ordinary defence of the scriptures to be in no enmity but in true unity with the scriptures and to be more real friends thereunto then either thy self who wilt be found in as real enmity to them as thou art in seeming friendship or any of those aforesaid with whom thou rankest us as if we were the rankest enemies thereof that ever appeared in any age since the scripture had a being to this present day
be it therefore unto thy self and all men who will believe and can receive it for truth and who so will not let the mischief of his in this matter be upon him that though we own not thee i.o and side not with but mostly against thee in that very book wherein thou standest up so stiffly against atheists and papists and all antiscripturists as well as against the men called quakers whom thou but supposest to be such and though we may possibly be found saying some things soberly which atheists and papists say scornfully of the scriptures which are by thee and at least twenty things that are asserted by thee of the scriptures in thy zealous pleadings for them yet we are no atheists as thou supposest neither are we papists or iesuites neither are we in any wise nor do we so much as take the part or serve the interest of nor side or comply with any of them any more then we do with thy self whose antagonist and d's too am in this present reply to thy reproaches of the quakers in vindication of whose interest alone abstract from that of the papists as much as from thy own and thy party of protestants and singly and solely on behalf of the truth professed by the quakers and opposed by thee and all the other whom thou opposest and finally for the scriptures which are truly owned valued used known and practised only among the quakers herein stand up more or lesse against you all as against such who none of you excepted no not those among you protestant pretenders to it who would sain seem to others as you do to your selves to be most fervent for it any more then those decryers and denyers of it with whom thou slanderously sayest the quakers side will every one of you be found foes to denyers of and fiery fighters against the scripture

and this that we are no atheists nor yet associates or assistants to any such as are without god in the world but that people who know god and are known of him above all other people upon earth the best of which in words professe to know god whom in truth they know not but in works deny being abominably in their lives disobedient to his light and to every good work void of judgement will as easily as evidently appear to every patient and impartial reader that can suspend his censuring till he hath read these present animadversions of thy mad subversions of the things of god unto the end

and that we are neither papists nor yet assenting or adhering to that

synagogue of rome in any of their abusive defamations depravations depressions decryings disparagements or abominable attempts for the abolition of the scriptures which they as thou sayest truly would if they were able deprive all others of or of their lives give the world here to understand as far as they will understand it or take it for truth form me who for truths sake meerly am of lesse credit and repute in it then else should be by a present protesting in the name and behalf of that people called quakers against the papists sordid sottish sinful shameful seeking wholly to suppresse the scriptures from being seen at all by the vulgar and scoring out of it what makes most against their bruttish and worse then heathenish idolatries and wresting those holy writings and turning them as they list to their own turns by their most false far off translations and as utterly untrue interpretations of them besides both the plain sense of the words in the original languages they were wrote in and mind of the spirit of god which originally moved holy men to write them and many more such juggles some of which twere better for it then it is if the clergy so called of the protestant part of christendom who are too too full of the like were cleare of and fully free from as they are not for all their protesting so much against the popedom for its adulterating of the scripture

which protestation of mine against the romish clergy the rather and the more largely enter here again not only because am so generally misreported that by many even thereupon am also to be too great a favourite and by some flatly a iesuite and so more then an ordinary friend to that false fraternity but also because it may fall out that that slender and senslesse suspition of me if not timely supprest by reason of three things may in time though groundlesse grow so great in more as it does already in some that for the sake thereof very truth it self when by me shall not tast well from me nor take place in the hearts of men with whom commonly damnati lingua vocem habet vim non habet

those three things above briefly hinted are more fully replyed to as followeth


in regard that not only in his two toyes puts us and the popish party together as brethren for jumping into one judgement about the scriptures but also thou who art a man more beleeved and beloved by the world which heeds and loves its own then who am not so much heeded as hated by it because am not of it dost often in thy unquiet quarrel with the quakers so called which who am one of them am now answering so unequally yoak us and the pontifical clergy together as against the scriptures that undefined span alphabet the younger sort for whose instruction thou devotest those thy latine labours and more then a good many of those iunior novices both in university and countrey as are ever ready as rawly as rashly iurare in sententiam seniorum to drink down desperately all that and digest it by implicit faith that is imposed and handed out to them for truth from the tongues and pens of their grand gamaliels sith thou dd sayest it will unquestionably more then think it to be all truth that thou sayest of our with the papists in their basenesse towards the scriptures in those false sayings of thine that are

wherein thou injuriously avouchest us to be approvers of all their tauntings and joynt blasphemers with them of the scriptures


in regard that howbeit it is not at all in vindication of the popish clergy in any of their devilish doings nor scornful or spiteful speakings against the scripture but of another interest even that of the true clergy or heritage of god as remote from theirs and thine too undefined span alphabet am an opposer of thee as to that same book wherein thou so vehemently opposest the papists hence many may as some already do suppose am in far firmer friendship and fellowship with that fry of fighters against the scripture then with thee and thy fellows who wouldest fain seem at least to fight against them for it but if any man will be ignorant of me and my honest meanings let him be ignorant for my part as am a to all souls and am in friendship with all men having and holding as truly pacem cum personis as cum peccatis bellum so am in no fellowship with that in all men whether of the romish religion or that which informe is more reformed that is not in fellowship with the scriptures for that which is not in union therewith is not in fellowship with god fighting against neither smal nor great save only against the sinful seed of the serpent in them which from the spirits of the spiritually throughout all christendom spawnes it self forth in spite and spiritual wickednesse against the seed of the woman who must bruise his head at last though he obtains for a while to bruise her heel between whose seed which is one and his seed of every sort whose name is legion for they are many the most endlesse enmity is so that though appear against those of thine wherein thou appearest upon the stage in part against that synagogue of satan but more palpably against the synagogue of the saints yet this is not all to gratifie the romanists in their scurrilities against the scriptures more then thee and thine abettors in your scarce much lesse scoldings for them but as occasion is pro scripturis for the scriptures which notwithstanding thy empty apologetica's for them ye and the papists also are both utterly against shall not spare to grate hard against you both as such who while you are scribling of the scriptures whether pro or con are yet our of that precious truth the scripture tells of and against that living word that eternal and internal light it calls to which leads to that life of god that the scripture calls for


in regard that am and shall unavoidably be found in this present controversie with thee saying some things against thee and thy untrue assertions for truths sake yet with a due respect thereunto which the very papists say though truly enough yet too disrespectfully about the scriptures
in this respect though would not have them so yet believe some are and some will be if peradventure these premises prevent it not so blind as to believe own the pope and his apostolical church because cannot own all that as true and apostolical which some prime protestants tell for truth but rather tell the truth with him when he tells it about the scripture or any other thing then errour and lyes with those who pretendedly for the truth and pro scripturis protest against him for must give the devil his due so as to acknowledge his words to be true when he speaks the truth though to a false end rather then sooth up thee

i.o or any other men so as to say the crow is white and that ye utter truth when ye tell utter untruth though against the devil himself to please either thee or them

howbeit many men in these dayes and not a few of those who are called christs ministers and counted well studied schollars or at least would not be well contented to be not so accounted are yet so dim as without any more ado to deem them to be romish priests under pay from the pope who own some truths which his priesthood owns as if because at rome they own christ to be the son of god they must needs be of that church who deny him not so to be but more especially any truths which by these divine deemers are not deemed to be truths and thereupon disowned by their selves upon whose crazy concerts and cloudy accounts and crooked conjectures some that do more service to the truth against popish fictions in a year then themselves do in an age are thorow their shallow surmises by their implicit faith't people as sinisterly supposed to be supporters of the papal hierarchy because themselves whose idol the letter is are not digested in all their extravagant exaltings of it though the popes extream of exalting his leaden legends and holy chaire above it be more professedly distasted and detested
thus such as believe according to the scripture the general grace and love of god in giving christ to die for all men for as much as that also is believed at rome seem to these senslesse ones to favour too much of popery because the empty understandings narrow nodels and heedlesse headpieces of many protestant parish priests are not as yet enlarged enough to comprehend it who notwithstanding being at home whilest eagle eyed abroad nunquam vident id manticae quod in tergo est never come to see or sent that plain popery of their parish posture and parish pay by way of tythes which the night is now too far spent for any but owles bats and not to see that its of the pope sith though its a piece of stark rank and popery not held without the guilt of perjury yet as its their own suus cuique crepitus bene olet so its that which serves their turn better at this time then the extirpation of it root and branch according to their oathes which would savour lesse of popery and more of pure pietv will ever do
of this sort of evil surmisers is who not only as thou dost accuses us me in particular as one big with and spitting out venome against the scriptures for not owning those outward writings as the only rule of faith and holy life but also accounts of us as no other then broachers of popish doctrines and bringers in of the popes baggage for dissenting as in other points so from his blind tenets about the scriptures yea so earnestly doth drive on his design of insinuating it into mens minds concerning me that am popishly affected that he finds occasion of accusation against me as so as well where more fully own the scripture then himself does as where may more easily seem to one thats blind to deny it

what a wicked and adulterous generation of men is this like that in which christ lived who would have something to say against the gospel and the truth let it come handed to them which way soever they would neither lament at christs mourning to them in iohns ministry nor dance at his piping to them in his own but reject and belye him when he came contrarily to them in iohns fastings and condescendingly to them in his own eatings and drinkings as either having a devil or being a drunkard or a gluttòn or a friend of gods enemies and sinners or somewhat or other still that was nought rather then own the truth at any hand that in both ministryes was held out unto them so is the ear of our now pharifaical generation of scribes stop'd like that of the deaf adder at the voice of the charmer let him charm never so wisely among whom t.d is a chieftain who ranks us among the popish party as spitting out our venome that we are big with against it page
pamph and as denyers of the scripture together with them because we deny many false things that many such ministers as himself do most absurdly affirm of it and yet charges us as brotherly owners and abbetors of the papists wickednesse also for owning the holy scripture in many parts of it wherein our english ministers do not blush to deny it and so consequently for owning it much more truly and fully then themselves thus

but that am not so popishly affected as am as well every way as every where misrepresented to be by those who to sit the more securely in their own popishnesse do in the apishnesse of their spirits sound it out with a dreadful noise to the stunning of their already people popery popery against all that come neer to storm them out of their popified parish postures practises and preferments to what have said sufficiently above shall now adde what followes in evidence thereof whether you will hear all ye my unjust accusers in that particular or whether ye will forbear to the perfect ending of my protestation which have begun to enter against that synagogue of rome viz

and as to their behaviour toward the scripture which they wofully mistake themselves to be the only trustees to whose care and custody it was committed professe against them with that they have wofully misdemeaned themselves towards it as by sowly betraying and to their own eternal shame that their pretended trust corrupting depraving vitiaring interpolating adding detracting forging foisting into the scripture what never was of the spirit so by abusing it every way so that none of the copies of it as it comes thorow their hands whether original or translated and if thou canst shew any that come thorow other hands of which thou canst say infallibly they are not altered and corrupted as in thy book thou hast not done dic quibus in terris eris mihi magnus apollo are fit to be a fixed stable rule or infallible guide to us thoroughout in the knowledge of the will of god and lastly for take it at the worst its worthy of a better carriage towards it then they afford it in a scurrilous scoffing way underva'uing vilifying defying unworthily depressing it far below it self as much as it is idolized blindly worshipped deisted and enthroned far above it self by your selves who together with the popish party like the frog and the mouse being very busie in busling against each other with your bulrushes about the scripture in your two opposite imaginations will find a generation that waits upon the lord and mounts up with wings as as an eagle though no better then a blind buzzard in your eyes who will winne the field from both you stout warriours which are at it tooth and nail to your own ruine and shall one have no more thank from god then the other whilest for all your zealous pratings pro and con in two different erroneous extreams concerning the letter ye are both exceedingly and both extreamly erred from the light it came from and the life it calls for the one exalting the bare dry bones and dead body of the letter above the word of life which letter too is magnified more in an empty sound of windy plausible commendations of it then by any so much as outward conformity to it in conversation the other establishing the dark lumpe of their own lying legends and dead stinking carcase of their traditional divinations partly derived from faithlesse forefathers and partly divined forth from the deep pit of their great ghostly fathers fathomlesse fancy as a standard in stead of it

so that howbeit i.o the detestable wickednesse of that antichristian conclave who as thou sayest sell themselves to work all manner of abominations against the scripture abominate as much as thou canst do yea be not thou so blind as to believe that abet them in any of their beastlinesse of that nature yet withal do not thou believe that that while abandon their brutishnesse can own thee in thy blindnesse and the many absolute absurdities whereby thou grossely abusest it and the truth and thy self as much another way who perhaps thinkest thou canst not easily if at all be transported into errour while thou art extolling the outward text of scripture and at a venture all that those debasers of it hold out about it for the time is coming as thou truly enough prophesiest unto them wherein it shall repent them for ever that they have lifted

so say to thee the time is at hand wherein it shall repent thee that ever thou liftedest up thy self as thou dost in so vain a way of lifting up and advancing the letter over all that which is to be preferred before it and was before it as that it came out from and points men to even the living word and inward light and spirit which as held out by the quakers not in any way of that devilish disparagement of as thou intimatest ex

or spiteful disrespect to the scripture thou settest at nought with all the calumny thou canst likely cast on them yea as thou sayest of the pope ex

he that will give heed to it let him if otherwise let him chuse non cum jesu itis qui itis cum jesuitis
so then as to evince it that am none of those idiots that idolize any meer mens writings as many do the un kilful scriblings of their scribes for the scriptures little lesse then israel did the golden calves after which they dotingly ran from god himself saying of these imuges in their own imaginations these are thy gods nor yet any meer writings of those holy men that wrote the holy scripture it self as most of our and their people do because they were written by divine inspiration little lesse then israel did the brazen serpent because it was hung up by divine institution shall first take occasion to thrust down that enthroned calf of thy triobulary treatises theses and atheological thoughts upon the scripture from that high place it hath in the thoughts of such as fall down before it as moses threw down that molten image which the high priest made and ignorant people made a god of and stamped it to powder and secondly as hezekiah not without gods own approbation took down the brazen serpent which had its being as the holy scripture it self had not without gods own appointment when once men began to do homage to it and called it no more then nehushtan that is a piece of brasse that they might know it was no god so shall take down the dead corps and bare carcase of the best copy of the scripture since men begin to go a whoring after it from god and christ and the word of life it self out of that high and stately throne wherein thou statest it and from those surpassing and lofty titles of the living word of god the most glorious spiritual light in the world above the sun the most perfect rule and many more such like with which thou as hereafter appears dost invest and exalt it over all even over the light it came from which is by thee unjustly put behind it and dehased below it though both in time and worth tis far before it and stile it by its own true name of writings of truth or holy scripture that so men that seek to it more then to god himself for salvation and search it and therein think to have eternal life at the old scribes did that never came to christ the light above whom they prefered it may recollect themselves and see that the

letter gives not the life but doth only testifie outwardly of another whom being lost from him by looking to the letter which bids look to him they never look to nor never yet came to that they might have life

so withal to evince it that am none of those popish ignoramus's that deal so ignobly with the holy scriptures as to set them at nought and pluck them down as they do not only below themselves which have as real and great an excellency as any such thing as is no more then an external writing of an external truth can possibly have but also below that which is worse then naught viz their leaden legend of lyes their trashy traditions their mouldy massora their invented oral law their vain verbum undefined span alphabet that meer imagined moon calf the unerring breast of their most erroneous holy father and such like shall in this work before all the world prefer the bare body and letter of the scripture which is legible to mens bodily eyes far before that undefined span alphabet as thou truly callest it for all their abominations before that whole body of fools bawbles that bottomlesse pit of paultrinesse that boundlesse bundle of baby clouts that endlesse ocean of omnigatherums that dirty puddle and deep dunghil of devility rather then divinity which the more its dived and raked into the more rotten it renders it self like some for did sink that stinkes the more the more tis stirred in for such is the traditionary treasury of that saltlesse unsavoury sea upon which therefore the plagues of the vials which must be filled upon you also are fallen falling and to fall which sea of rome is as the blood of a dead man lifelesse putrid and corrupt so that every living soul dies that lives therein

yea consider the naked literal aspect of the holy scriptures nor in its highest not in its primitive best and purest as at first given forth but in its meer derivative in its lowest meanest and most altered and adulterated capacity wherein it stands at this day wrested and torn and like a nose of wax twisted and twined into more then twice if not ten or twenty times twenty several shapes by mens untrue and tottered transcripts and translations for oh that vast variety of lections besides the infinity of senses throw mens misrenderings corrupt copyings correctings of and commentings on it that the world is now loaded with and led out into yet as meer a graven image as that is with ink and pen on paper or skin of parchment for tis so though reject their jeers as improper and impious by whom it is scoffed at as chartacea membranae for tis not so and as dead a letter as it is bear with me in that expression till come to shew where thou so callest it as well as papists and quakers whom thou quarrellest with for so calling it and as very a nose of wax and lesbian rule and no certain stable standard as it is for know not why what they wickedly because tauntingly we may not honestly sith truly seriously and soberly so call which may so easily so endlesly be altered by the wills of men as they self i.o shewest us in the
pages of they preface the scripture may and made to stand which way any critick pleases and as no authority to us at all as they in their basenesse and hatred of it which condemne do say it is of as tis my continual exercise in works to do it so do here in plain words exalt the scripture which they so debase and state it over all that their trash and aforesaid trumpery even on the very top of all their long train of

traditions and over the archest tittle of the tripple crown the proudest pinacle of peters now peter painted temple the highest point of that pompous pious piteous pillar and ground of truth the choicest chapiter of that holy church and infallibly erring infallible chair

thus doing shall be own'd at last if not by and such as have his dimme doings as have his person in admiration because of advantage yet by all unbyassed beholders of both our undertakings for the scripture to be no more a pander for the papists as am more belyed then believed to be the lying tribe of levi then for himself but a just plain and impartial pleader for the scripture against them both and a doer of right to those holy writings which are egregiously wronged by both papists and protestants as between two parties of partial praters pro and con about them by one of which they are scarcely more sottishly and satanically for superstitions sake abhorred then unduly and superstitiously adored by the other
for howbeit thou deemest thy self and those thy self reverencing fellow students of it to whom thou dedicatest thy endeavours to vindicate it to be such as value the scripture as much as any thou knowest yet there are many whom thou knowest not but supposest to be sleighters and disowners of it who if to own value and exalt it be to ascribe all that to it which it assumes to it self to preach and practise that holy life which is the end of it and to give it its due and no more as indeed it is do own value honour and exalt the holy scripture much more and much more truly then any of your selves who saving your fair speeches for it and your fawnings on it ore tenus your common aiëry and meer verbal commendations thereof and of your selves as valuers thereof do yet in truth no more value or honour it then the iewes whose grand idol that is as the whole is yours at this day do their own owned part thereof of whose dotage in that kind have in sundry nations been an in not a few of their synagogues who adorn and carry it about as ye do your bibles more beautified without then your selves are within and lift it up with loud noises especially when these words are read viz
he shall magnifie the law and make it honourable when yet the truth it makes mention of hath no mansion in their minds to the renewing of them yea may truly say you do more undervalue the scripture by your advancing it above it self and and worshipping it so much as ye do in your words whilst alienated from the light it came from and calls to in your works and lives then some of the synagogue of very rome it self who in lips and lives too do undervalue it by how much deceit and hypocrisie is far greater iniquity then tis for men openly to disown what cordially they do not own and to pretend to be no better friends to it then indeed they are and by how much as all is not gold that glisters so all that which by its glistring would fain seem to be gold when it is but drosse is worse then that which both is drosse and seems to be so

yea those that undervalue the scripture so as to set traditions above it and they that overvalue it so as to set the light below it both these must come under condemnation from me as being both abomination to the lord before whom witness the brazen serpent and christs apostles acts to
whom the people did worse in worshipping as gods then if

they had not heeded but hated them as of the devil it may be worse to overvalue then to undervalue many things which may be of his own appointment so that ye have little need to decry against papists as decryers of the scriptures and lesse to link us the quakers and papists together as adversaries in common to the scriptures as if your selves were the only patrones thereof for as as ye seem to be about the scriptures yet ye will be found acting not more against them then though in a different way from the papists against the scriptures

and howbeit thou taylest us and the papists together figuring us out by thy fine tale of the aforesaid foxes as falling from and fighting against each other and yet both against the scripture that is false as urged and uttered with that referrence to the papists and quakers as joynt injurers of the scriptures wherewith thou ridiculously relatest it but true enough yea too too true if related in that right referrence which it bears toward the papists and your selves yea quid rides be not so merry about the mouth for de te mutato nomine quakers fabula narratur thou thinkest thou hast shrewdly hurt thy meer fancied fanatick foes with a flap of a but in that tale thou hast but made a rod for thy own tayle for verily he that hath but half an eye and by thy mentioning thereof is minded to search where and to whom thy simile best suits will find how causelesly and incongrously thou crowdest the papists and quakers so closely together as companions in thy abusive comparison and how aptly it may rather be applyed to that romish synagogue and your selves to whom it comes as nigh as four feet if any simile can truly be said to run on all four can well carry it and who as much as ye dissent not only in diverse other matters but also about the scripture it self the one for and the other against the perfection purity integrity authority and excellency of the meer text and bare letter of it do yet concur as closely and come as nigh to one another in denyal of the truth and doctrine thereof as four pence comes to a groat
yea the truth is your selves and they are far more fitly figured by those foxes which tended two several wayes yet ended in one and the self same work of destroying the philistims corn whil'st turning tayl to tayl and drawing into your two different extreames one sort crying up unwritten traditions to be the most perfect rule above the scripture the other crying up the outward letter as the most perfect rule above the internal light word and spirit which gave it forth ye not only fill the world as with so many fire brands with your fiery contentions so that like that corn which failed when it felt the fire it fell together by the eares to its own ruine and destruction but also between you draw and drive all people being erred from it your selves from that which was before them in the being of a rule and will be found to be a most perfect rule without them both viz that light which thou so laughest at
so that their souls starve famish perish and pine away for lack of the true bread of life christ iesus whom the light only leads to and for want of that corn of heaven which god feeds those with that truly fear him

and as to what is said about your valuing and exalting the scripture

which ye say the papists and quakers do set light by and undervalue say if to be very busie about the dead bulk the bare of that book which contains the scripture called the bible if to blesse it and adorn and adore the naked body of it if to do by it little lesse then all that the papists do in way of honour and exaltation of it to the dead body of their great goddesse the virgin mary be to honour and value the bible then ye honour it indeed but scarcely else if to overlay it with gold and curious colours if to make images and pictures of it to print it on title pages of their own books in the hands of priests if to hand it up in paint upon sign posts ensignes colours
if to attribute to it many high prerogative titles which are not belonging to it but to christ the light and his light alone as via per quam nos ad deum deus ad nos the saints re'uge most perfect rule living word of god and a score more of the same sort which it no where takes to it self which yet who so cannot give it cannot have the common priviledges due to them with other men in their own native countries if to laud the letter more then lead the life which it requires if to be ever coming for counsel to it but never conforming to the counsel of it when it calls you to the light for life if to place holinesse righteousnesse and religion more in a round of reading it and preaching upon it then in being and becoming so holy righteous religious unspotted of the world as it requires if to spare no cost in printing binding beautifying buying bibles of all sorts and sizes storing all studies libraries and houses therewith if to carry them about under your arms if to hold them up in your hands out of the pulpit ore a soft cushion while till the glasse be run you collate thereon if to be more critical in coting and punctual in noting this proof and t'other about the practice of piety then to practice the piety therein approved if to be loud and clamorous for this or that more corrected copy of it against these or those that are more corrupted if to have it in so high esteem and account as to count it one of the most gainful commodities that men can trade in or get money by ministring out of if to cry it up and make no small stir about it as demetrius the silversmith who by making shrines for her brought no small gain to himself and his fellow craftmen who by that craft had their wealth did about their image diana which fell down from iupiter who with the workmen of like occupation cried out full of wrath of the greatnesse of their goddesse against such as they could not prove to be blasphemers of her for fear least there should be a despising and of that more then fit magnificence they magnified her withal by promoting of the truth and so their craft be in danger to be set at naught if to vindicate it with as much in long
scripture defending discourses crude indigested divinity disputations such as o's
from that real right which is done it by its rightest friends the quakers who vindicate it from that real wrong that is done to it by its forenamed not so much nominal as real foes if to decry them who decry those that in workes deny it as decryers of it like such as use to cry whore first against honest matrons left their own whoredoms by them discryed should be discovered if manually and verbally more then mentally and vitally to advance and extol it if so to advance extol and value it as to detrude deride

so that howbeit thou i.o in thy hostile mind representest the quakers as hostes undefined span alphabet enemies and haters of the scriptures there's no such matter for if they be haters of it that hate to be reproved by it and cannot endure the sound doctrine delivered in it which is according to godlinesse the letter hath no such haters of it as the very ministers of the letter are who are ever enmity against the life light and spirit it calls to walk in and if they may be said to love it who are livers according to it the very letter itself hath no such true lovers of it as the quakers who are in thy blind zeal hated by thee as haters of it for living that life it calls for
as to thy tale of our striving to thrust the scripture from its own place in the church of god its as true a tale as its fellow false ones for though we set christ and his inward light living word and spirit only on the throne in the church yet we own and establish the scripture which is but the meer letter in its proper place wherein it is to stand since it had its being as so from the other as subservient and subordinate to the other which are its betters and its elders and not as such a dominus fac iotum as thou makest it as if those that gave being to it must now come under it so as to stand barely at the bar before it to be tryed by it while it sits in supream authourity on the bench as the most perfect infallible touch stone lydius lapis and standing rule for no lesse but much more thou wouldest have it even light rule of trial iudge witnesse and all to which all spirits even gods own that gave it out as well as all false ones must stand or rather stoop and submit to be judged by and the foundation which the church or world in the world or wheel in a wheel must stand or else fall and fail for ever for as there was a time wherein the church which is but one from abel till now can have but one and the same rule bottom and foundation for ever and one rock on which its built which is neither peter nor paul nor any of their writings nor of any prophets that wrote afore them but christ the light to the nations and the rock of ages and generations was without it and not placed upon it so there was a time of thousands of years together wherein it had no place nor use at all in the church nor so much as any being in the world and as for such high place as thou in thy own will now alowest it as its own as wise and quicksighted as thou art to know and see non entities and things that never were at all know no such place that god ever set it in nor time when he so exalted it and though acknowledge and am not ignorant as thou art that meer men and blind builders as seeing as thyself have canonized it into the head of the corner laying him aside whom god hath made so yet am to learn and so art thou for all thy hasty teaching it as truth to others where ever the bare letter or scripture which is all one was created into such a lord as thou lookest on it to be over his inward light spirit in the heart and authorized so infinitely as thou imaginest over all things by the lord god of heaven and earth the only author and creator of all things

j.o
not only to detrade the scripture from its place but also that by that one only device of denying to the scripture that glorious title of the word of god the quakers aim and endeavour to divest christ himself of his personality and divine being

reply
was ever man left of god to shew his own folly by more palpable apparent absurdities then thou here utterest who by that very thing whereby we seek to invest christ with the proper and peculiar right both in name and nature whereof your selves rob him belyest us so as to say we thereby seek to divest him of it is not the word of god not only the proper name ioh
rev
but also the proper nature and divine being of christ which he had before he was made flesh from the very beginning before the scripture was that declares of him before world it self was which was made by him and all things in it so that without him nothing was made that was made and because that we will not take this glorious title of his to whom only of right it belongeth viz the word of god who hath no corruptible word that know but only one thats incorruptible and liveth and abideth for ever and is both essentialiter and effective and enunciative too the word of god and invest such a corruptible thing herewith as the mouldring letter a writing with mens hands which worms may eat and mens hands blot out deface and destroy and because we will not attribute that everlasting name of his to that which in nature is not everlasting as ye do but decaying dost thou say we divest him of his divine being dost thou not beget this bastardly businesse of divesting christ himself of his divine name and nature excellency and existence in thy own brain by ascribing these to the scriptures and giving the glory thereof to another under that high prerogative title of the word of god due only and alone to him and not to any letter that man as moved by him writes of him and then lay it at the door of the quakers art not thou the man that appropriatest that name and nature which is proper to christ alone to the scripture by disputing as to name and thing in esse reasi cognoscibili that it is the word of god that glorious title is its proper name and is not this what in you lyes to dethrone christ who only is so and place another ever him as the only most perfect light foundation touchstone by which his spirit must be tryed and yet accusest thou the quakers of displacing him

doth not the scripture say that christ is the light which the church ministerially is to hold out bear witness to ioh in all her preachings administrations and walkings and the scripture is written out for the sake and instruction and profit or use and service of the church tim
cor
yet settest not thou the letter above the church and christ too saying page
the scripture is light it is the duty of every church to hold it up almost the whole of its duty and this duty it performs ministerially not authoritatively
a church may bear up that light it is not the light it bears witnesse to it but kindles not one divine beam to further its discovery all the

preaching that is in any church its administration of ordinances all its walking in the truth hold up this light thus magnifying the letter above all and making it the main businesse of the church to magnifie and hold it up much what as the iewes do whose work in their synagogues is to lift up the letter while they loath the law and the light it came from and is but the meer letter or writing of


the whole truth of the words of god is as to name and thing opposed by the poor fanatical quakers satan in these dayes assaults the sacred truth of the word of god in the poor deluded fanatical souls among us commonly called quakers

reply
it was none but satan himself that is a lyar the father of it who told thee so and in thee tells it out for truth to the whole world for
the whole word of god which is but of one not of many kinds that know of as thou wouldest make it as if god had one living one dead one fallible another infallible one corruptible another incorruptible one eternal one temporal word one thats only letter another that's spirit and life one written and another unwritten one within men and another thats not the same in nature without men that one and the same individual word of god say which is the same whether within or without written or unwritten neither of which the bare writing is as to both name and thing we own and honour as that which from everlasting to everlasting is unchangeably authoritative over all inviolably pure every way entire and absolutely perfect as god is whose word it is and so we assault it not in its name nor in the thing as thou sayest for we know and never did yet deny unlesse twere before we knew it and while we were the same with you who yet know it not nor never heard it from his own mouth the word of god to be the word of god and also though thou scandalize us so grossely as to say satan sets us on work to bereave the scripture of the glorious title of the word of god as its own proper name that
is also false for at the will of god and in service and obedience to him and not of satan we strip the meer letter of that glory wherewith thou unduly dost invest it and take it down from that high throne and authority wherein satan sets thee on work to set it up men may do homage to it and so run a whoring after it from the word of life it only points at as israel did after the brazen serpent and dance about it in their idolatrous hearts as the god that must save and deliver out of egypt
but
were that true yet howbeit we own the word of god to be as truly and properly called the word of god as in truth it is so and give to that still its own due proper name of the word of god somewhat more then yourselves do who call that by the name of and make that title of the word of god the very proper name of another thing which is not it but as inferiour to it as the effect is to the cause it came from viz the outward letter

or scripture that came forth from it and is but a copy and declaration or images of it as much in

worth and dignity below it as the painted picture of a fire or a man on a wall is to the true fire or person which they do but outwardly represent
and
as for the writing or scripture which thou sayest we deprive of its proper name because we call it not the word of god and by all those glorious titles and epithites thou stilest it by which we confesse are due to the word viz
light living powerful quickning foundaiton most perfect rule and many more as we shall see anon thou sayest most falsly in that for these are as truly due so properly due to and the proper names of the word it self only of which the writing is but a writing or meer scriptural declaration and not the proper name nor properties of the scriptures

i.o thou tellest ep pag
that the whole truth about the word of god which thou falsly slanderest us as confusedly opposing thou hast endeavoured to comprize in thy theses
reply
thy asserting that the scripture ought to be called the word of god as its proper name and that it is in esse reali cognoscibili the word of god and known so to be and consequently the light foundation rule and whatever else the word is known to be which is the main matter thou affirmest and puzlest thy self to prove against us is so far from being the whole truth about the word of god that it hath no truth at all in it but in plain truth is wholly a lye in esse reali cognoscibili also to all but such as know not as thy self dost not in this point either what they say or whereof they affirm
thou sayest thou compleatest in thy theses the doctrine of the scripture concerning the scripture
reply
thy doctrine concerning the scripture which is that it is the word of god and known so to be and is to be called or else its stript out of its own proper name this is not the doctrine of the scripture concerning it self but thy own doctrine which though thou dignifie it with the title of pro scripturis in thy latine title page is more con anti then either cum or pro yea much more against then either according to or for the scriptures

i.o thou speakst of the quakers as altogether rejecting the word of god with thee the scripture as to its whole use of spoiling the holy scriptures of all vse authority perfection

and as those who if things had succeded according to their desires would no doubt long since have have utterly rejected them
yea as those who wish them quite blotted out that all men might more attend to the light within themselves

reply
though what use authority and perfection the scripture is owned by us to be of will appear more anon in its proper place yet that we deny it not to have an authority and perfection and precious use here declare to the undeceiving of such as are deceived by thy deceits and lyes much lesse do we reject as thou falsly objects against us the word of god it self which is a greater matter and of more moment then the scripture as to its whole vse and in proof of it against thy self that we own the very bible and letter to be of use and do also much use it as occasion is shall here cite to give account to i.o of this lye that against i.o
himself hath forged

yea shall go no further at present then to thy self who as in at least twenty things more in thy fardel thou dost confutest thy self as to this lye in those very parcels above quoted
for mark art not thou the man who as brisk as thou art in bedirting us with this slander of rejecting the scripture which thou falsly callest the word of god as to all its use its whole use and that altogether could we have had our wills yet to the contradicting of thy self which is as ordinary with thee as to eat and drink confessest and commendest us thus far before all as follows in thy latine piece where thy words englished are to this purpose ex

that the quakers professe the holy scriptures to contain a certain revelation of gods will and so far to have come forth from god as it proceeded from that inward light which was from christ in those who wrote those books which ye name the scriptures
and ex

that the quakers acknowledge the scriptures to contain a manifestation of the will and mind of god both in respect of those who wrote them and of those also to whom they were delivered from the beginning and that this declaration therein held proceeded from the spirit of christ which was so with the writers thereof that they could declare the infallible truth and that the things written therein are an undoubtedly true declaration of the mind of god and dost thou not add thus much that thus far we are right and that none that own them thus far can altogether reject the scriptures unlesse he will declare himself to be selfcondemned and that we will not easily yield to a renouncing of this confession

is all this then that thy self confessest of us the quakers whom thou condemnest for utter rejecting the scripture consistent with such an utter rejecting it as thou chargest them with dost not here clear the quakers out of thy own mouth out of which thou condemnest them for the same thou clearest them in to the condemning of thy self to be one out of whose one and the same mouth comes to the same men blessing and cursing excusing and accusing for the same thing doth any good fountain send forth sweet water and bitter at the same time is not thy tongue an unruly member which thy self can'st tame no better then therewith to blesse god and men too that are made after gods image as owners of the scriptures and yet to curse them with thy lyes as denyers thereof when thou hast done art thou not herein right baalam like who for the

from which god kept him would sain have cursed israel with his divinations as thou dost with thy divinity disputations and yet was against his will forced to forbear and to his own shame to blesse them altogether

object
oh but quoth i.o no matter what the quakers confesse of the scripture now no doubt had things fallen out accordinn to their desire and if people could have born the denyal of it who bore such respect to the scripture that they would have flown with fury on the quakers pates if they should have seemed to deny it the quakers from whom the fear of that more then the force of truth forces that confession proculdubiò jamdudum rejecissent had doubtlesly rejected them utterly long ago ex

reply
this is not so true not a surmise as this viz
no matter how the priests fawn own the kings protectors parliaments or powers still that are in present being to save their standings in their present places and preferments no heed's to be given to their crouchings cringing and humble representations no doubt but as things fall out and succeed to the serving of their interest they will turn still to what best serves their turns and have exceptis excipiendis been generally known to have done so now long ago even from henry the eighths time to this very day
as for the quakers could they have dissembled so as ye do for fear of mans fury they might have escaped many if not all those furious fallings of your bloudy upon their pares and have saved oxford and cambridge that labour pains they more like fiends then friends of truth have been at to persecute them long since also

i.o dost not thou say tis evident enough that some of us read the holy scripture in private or at least remember what we have read or heard out of it and for the most part carry the holy bible about with us and that in our digladiations or disputes we very often rehearse and urge the words of the scriptures and that the reason why we own translations is because being not learn'd farther then our mother tongue we shall then deprive our selves of all use of the scriptures which we are loath to do which of these two o's
must we believe or if it be but one i.o as no doubt it is divided against himself and telling two contrary tales whereof but one can be true which of his two testimonies must men give credit to that wherein he sayes we strive to bereave men of all vse of the scripture and count it odious and abominable to have heresies errour false doctors and doctrines convicted and confuted out of it or that clean contrary one wherein he tells all men that we use it so as to read it in private remember what we read or hear of it carry it about with us use it and urge out of it in our disputes and are shy of denying it to be translated into english for our use least we should be deprived of all that vse of it our selves which we are willing to make

for my part let others do what they will have found i.o telling so many lyes when in his malice he talkes against the quakers that shall rather take that for truth now which against his envious lying self he here

talks for them for some vse and that not a little himself here affirms we make of the scriptures and in other places quotes many scriptures out of which we argue against our opposers and if it be never so little use its enough to stop his mouth out of his own mouth who sayes we utterly reject the scriptures as to all its vse for he that rejects it as to its whole use or all its use must be one that makes no use of it at all

and if i.o's
testimony had been only that we deny many ill uses of it that himself and other scribes make that spend and take up more time in scraping and scribling for it then take care to live the life of it and that wrest it to their own ruine he had said the truth or had he said we deny many of those good lifes that many make of it he had much lessened his lye and his folly in it but because we own it not as useful to all those extraordinary weighty and mighty lifes which he sayes falsly are to be made of it which indeed are to be made only of the eternal internal spirit word and light it came from to say we deny all vses of it as if it were good and profitable and useful and fit for nothing this renders his lye the more lyable to all mens view and himself to be as blind as one that can see no difference between staring and stark mad
what is that which is not said to be good for all things thereupon said to be good for nothing if should say soft wax is not useful to stop hot ovens with must it straitway be thrown away and must it be taken for granted that say its not good to seal with or that its useful for nothing that may be good to cut and kill as a knife that when it hath so done can't quicken nor heal nor save nor cure the letter kills as an executing instrument but the spirit only gives the life
and whereas thou sayest we wish it blotted out that men may come to the light within in which is the life nay stay no hast to hang true men we would have all come to the light and life within indeed no such hast yet of the scriptures going hence though old it will wax once and wear away there's many pretious uses though not all the eminent ones thou talkest of to be made of it before it go hence one whereof is that very thing upon the account of which thou falsly sayest we wish it blotted out viz
that men may come to the light within which the scripture is so far from hindering any from coming to but only that the blind porers in it with their natural eyes cannot see wood for trees that it sides with us in helping to call people to the light in the heart which thing is as well the end of its being written as it was the end of paul and iohn's and all the prophets ministry by word of mouth act
ioh
and is the end of all our ministring now as we are moved of the lord by voice or writing the letter bids look to the light as that which leads on to the life but both letter and light are a cloud to the egyptians that pursued them which to israel that obeyed it was a help

and as it serves with us to call to the light so before it passe away it must be used against them to send them packing first that have abused it as thou hast done and to accuse as a witnesse against them such as have owned it as their rule and foundation yet lived and built so much as ye have done beside it
and as christ said to the old searchingscribes joh
that would never come to him the life whom they testified

of so say to you of the same seed do not think that christ by his light within you only whereby ye are made as all men are who have not the law in a letter a law before god to your selves will accuse you to the father ye have another that accuses you for your vanities and deceits even moses and the apostles and prophets writings in whom ye trust to get life for if you had believed them you would not have belyed but beleeved in and obeyed the light and word in the heart which they call you to for the scriptures testifie of that but fith you believe not their testimony to the light how can we look that by our words ye should come to believe in the light it self

so that ye stand condemned and must be judged by the law or light within as well as such as are without the law in a letter without and fining under and against the law in the letter by the very letter of the law throw boasting and yet breaking of which ye dishonour god much more then the heathen do rom
ye must be condemned also
so that the scripture is of much use yet and we are free it should stand and not be blotted out that by the testimony of it which is one and the same with ours to the light ye might be if yet it may be brought to look to the law of christ which and not the letter is the light and life but if you will not come to christ and his light in you that ye may have the life its all of a price to you whether the scripture stand or be blotted out for your names are not while ye are enemies to the light written there for life but as yet blotted out even by the scripture while it abides unblotted out from under heaven

thou sayest the quakers little regard the understanding of the scripture and this is one of their eminent deceits so long as they have the words they are well enough without the sense as nothing appertaining to them
reply
saving i.o's
fine figment in this matter which may be more manifested in its proper place howbeit we are well satisfied without so many several silly senses and of it as are ministred cut by the unlearned ministers that know not the mind of the lord nor ever shall while they lean to their own meer natural empty understandings and in the letter as they do without the spirit which only receives and reveals the deep things of god and opposing the light that only opens it yet we are not against the true sense and meaning of the spirit which expounds the mysteries and shews the secrets thereof to those few babes that fear the lord which are hidden from the worldly wise and prudent but whether the renowned rabbies preach for prize or hold their peace we neverthelesse still have true meanings and mind of christ

that they affirm it is not lawful for any to interpret the scriptures or give the sense thereof
and
that altogether with the interpretation it self they reject damne curse all mediums of opening scriptures the weighing the words and phrases and daily prayer and comparing of divers places together that the opening of hard places the clearing and proving of the truth the conviction and confutation of heresies errours

false doctors and doctrines the edifying any by instructions and exhortations and all the other ends of lawful interpretation of the scriptures are odious and abomination to them they not only prosecute with enmity all expositions of the scripture by word of mouth in private families meetings churches schools of believers to the opening of the sense of the word and the giving of knowledge by the scripture it self but also as little esteem and most childishly defame both commentaries and all other books wherein part of the scripture is interpreted or any truth cleared or confirmed out of it or the faithful perswaded by exhortations to holinesse and gospel obedience or men are instructed in any other manner whatsoever in the knowledge of god

reply
whether all these stories of i.o which have here put together do more savour of the french galimafrey or i'le not determine but am sure they are an unsavoury mess of omnigatherums made up of many sorts of lying reproaches that have no consistency with the truth which would far better have become a doctor of divinity to have told of the devil himself had he been accusing of him who is the false accuser of the true brethren rather then such a legend of lyes as lye here legenda legible to all that know them of the quakers
cannot say of this indeed as of t.d his doings in his way of sharp shooting out his false tales against us that it will sound much to our shame in a countrey church because its well nigh all laid out not to say lyed out in the latine tongue though only englished here but it will ring such a peal in the university colledges among the iunior sort of haters of whom god loves and among all save the men against the quakers as will make them prick up their ears and listen that they may learn how to lye against them also more then ever they did to the quakers themselves that of them they might learn the truth but the best on't is though here's a nest of them together if that would do any good to i.o or hurt to the quakers yet by lyes and deceits none ever did or ever must prevail against the truth
yet to all this thou addest that we turn the church of god into a hogsty and that we are great reproachers of that divine goodnesse that gave it in setting so slight by interpretations of the scripture in order to the understanding of it to all which yet shall answer no otherwise then thus briefly and soberly as followes

viz
we acknowledge gods goodnesse in giving it and deny not all exposition of the matters in it provided it be by them as they are so moved that live in the light and spirit of god that gave it forth by holy men which onely opens it aright and knows its own and searcheth the deep things of god that are laid down in it in the writings and meetings and churches and schools of the saints and believers which wot you well are not your colledges nor academical covents but the quakers publick congregations where have sometimes had and heard more scripture truly opened in an hour than in some steeple houses in a year any more than we do any true translations of it out of our tongue into another of which matter about translation sith thou sayest we covertly conceal our counsel

thou mayest have it more fully perhaps anon when have first wiped away all thy lyes of us out of the way

but because we do indeed though owning the spirit and spiritual mens expositions yet deny the naturally wise mens cloudy conceptions mysty meanings senses and excentrick expositions of the things of the spirit which he knows not as they lye in the letter which he knows as little as useful or profitable much more as so necessary as thou wouldest make this natural mans mighty doings about the scripture who is he indeed and not the quakers that for want of such spiritual learning as naturally unlearned peter had wrests it into strange senses to his own ruine and because we do not childishly as thou sayest we do but soberly and justly complain of those vast confused bombasting bumbles of blindnesse of the cloudy clergies composing viz comentaries and other books thrust out upon pretence of clearing the scripture which is clearer then they are but in truth to the thickening of the ayr that the sun shines not clearly thorow it thereupon to say that we reject damn and curse all manner of opening scripture and that of daily prayers to god this is a businesse of thy own bruiting about whereby to render us odious among thy oxonian fellow students that they may reject and damn and curse them thence whom god hath not cursed and against whom none of baalams inchantments can prevail for we own the daily prayers of such as god owns who pray in the spirit though we know god hears not sinners nor the prayers of the wicked nor of such as turn their ear from hearing his law which is light in their own hearts their prayers are abomination to him and we own the openings of the scripture by the spirit that gave it forth when he opens the mouth or guides the pens of any that have the minde of christ to utter any of it as it lies in the letter hid from the natural mind unto others and to say this is to turn the church into a hogsty as if there could possibly by no religion nor good manners nor sheep like innocent demeanour nor any thing but meer bruitishnesse beastlinesse and swinishnesse any where in the world but where men sit under the ministry of the preachings logical expoundings writings ecclesiastical rhetorick and other reacks of those fleshly and earthly minded spiritual men doctors and commentators that have long ago got the parent and ingrossed all that work of expounding scripture for money to themselves this utterly dény and also affirm that if that crew and their creatures be the christians and the church of god as they call themselves as if the quakers were all hereticks that do not own them then the more ado men make to be christians in name the further off from the nature of christ and as the old proverb is the nearer the church the further from god there being nor such fordid stinking sinks for wickednesse filth pride lust persecution scoffing hating god and good ungodlinesse and all manner of uncleannesse to be seen in all the christian world again as are easie to be seen in cathedrals colledges academies where men sit at the fountains and of divinity and nurseries of learning and religion as they call them and directly under the daily dispensations of their doctors oral and scriptural divinity disputations and expositions

and whereas makes a challenge to have it tryed between them and the quakers saying in the next section after that wherein he saves the

quakers sleighting their interpretations do no lesse than turn the church into a hogsty thus


for if the experience of all ages of all christians that ever were if those things which themselves see behold or hear daily were of any weight or moment they the quakers would blush to deny the use necessity and fruit of the solemne preaching of the word interpretation of the scripture made whether by word of mouth or writing let us take a view of each flock both that which although they enjoy the word yet is destitute of its interpretation and also that which together with the word of god enjoyes also the other means of gods worship which consists very much in the interpretation of the word if now the tree be so be known only by its fruits then that will appear the good one which hath brought forth those fruits which the legal interpretation of the scripture hath every where produced or brought forth

reply
let it be well heeded first that by the word of god here intends the scripture and secondly that by legal interpretation he intends not such as is as said before used and own'd by the quakers viz
that which is only in the light and in the spirits movings that moved to write the scripture but such as is made among the naturalists and schollars in their academical imaginations and by the priests in their parishes and then am here ready to answer his challenge and say a match let it be so
first let both flocks be viewed the quakers and the parish people will not say but that among them that are called quakers that frequent the places of their publick speaking there are many not only by reason of whom but also by whom the way of truth that the quakers walk in is evil spoken of but either hath or should have more wit and sense and reason then to account the routs that are made by a rabble of rude ones that frequent the quakers meetings to render them odious with their odious carriages to the quakers themselves that he ought non trepidantibus sed tripudiantibus vitio vertere qui vertunt seria ludo ludunt cum sacris to impute not to the quakers but to schollars and apprentices and prateis and players and ungodly scoffers and children of the devil that make a mock and a may game of holy matters and would never band so bitterly against the quakers and their meetings if there were not something of god in both

secondly in their meetings there may be some antick tricks done by some that have run out from the truth and lost their conditions and being not stedfast in their watch to the light have degenerated into darknesse and delusion by whom some things have been done and many more then t.d mentions that are not owned by the quakers to whom they are wise men the while that blame the quakers for it who can't prevent it as and proctors might young schollars rudeness and magistrates the peoples bruitishnesse in parishes but will not

and thirdly in the silent meetings of the quakers there may be some that get no further then the outward form of godlinesse and not grow out into the power and here and there one that may be with a fault which if they be it shall be found with a witnesse by the wicked that watch for their halting and will make more of one malefactor that's found among all the quakers then of drunkards swearers cursers scurrilous scoffers and scorners gamesters couzeners cheaters lyars laughers and in a parish and then many scores of theeves fellons murderers and hainous malefactors that are hanged and every year that live and die under the ministry of the church of england

but make the worst that can be made of the quakers crimes if they were fold worse then they are or rather single out the very excrements and dreggs that depend that way to say something against yet hoc astquid nihitest that something is nothing in comparison of that open prosessed prophannesse and iniquity that abounds beyond the bounds of modesty yea of ordinary immodesty and of impudency it self among the parish people where there is such a constant custom and deal of expounding of and preaching from the scrirture by the ministerss of their own meanings upon it in which meer anthropo theological labours of the clergy the extraordinary high acceptance of which by the powers and parliaments and priests each from other is expressed and accosted ordinarily with the common complement of great thanks for their great pains and as eminently fruitful and profitable as thou professest it to be it is evidently more profitable to the preachers purses then the peoples persons whether we consider the bereavings of poor mens bodies of their right or the successelessnesse of thereof to their souls which from year to year are little or nothing the better for the blasted ministry of these and prophets which the lord is against as fast as they run in his name and blesses not but sayes they shall not profit people at all and as apparent it is they do not as tis that god sayes they shall not
for from generation to generation what fruit is found in the parish churches of the popes constituting and what successe to sanctification and salvation from sin by the great pains of the successive sermonists of several sorts that simonically have got their gifts at university and as freely given them out as they have freely received them if so to do be to sell them for more money then they cost them there is seen by the true seers who can see little ungodlinesse and worldly lusts and moral wickednesse since the old homilies were read by the animatum curates were succeeded by the powerlesse preachers that are more reformed from the more grosse idolatry

and superstitions of those dismal seasons
is there any parish any better mannered then in ages above doth not every priest that hath stood years in his parish leave it for the most part as blind ignorant dissolute lascivious riotous luxurious as he found it whether he dies among them or departs from them to a bigger booty a coming together there is for customes sake in their best cloathes as finely as they can afford to do when their supposed sabbath comes about in its turn a sound comes from a mouth and enters in at one ear of the people as fast as it can get out at the other and while it stayes it swims in the head but sinks not down to renew the heart and some psalms may be sung to the praise of him whom the dead in sin that live sin cannot praise and so there's an end of the businesse for that day till it come again till when hell breaks loose and the devil is served for the most part all the week after insomuch that it is but for the kettle to upbraid the pot with its black ugly hue for the priest and his people to make narratives of the worst of that naughtinesse that is found anong the very worst of those that are own'd as one in fellowship by the quakers and their ministry

secondly let both flocks he viewed viz the young and old schollars at universities to begin near home at oxford and cambridge behold those that sit under your grave divine doctorly expositions and at the ocean of books that are bound down beside what a number each hath in his private musing place by your library benches and the quakers that sit in silence and wait only on the lord let both flocks be tryed by their fruits and see which most resembles christ and whether the quakers carriage or the schollars since the quakers came among them have been most innocent vninjurious and harmlesse and which look most like the swine wolves bears tygars and which most like the fold and lambs of christ
and which of these two viz the quakers that have the word and yet are retired from you to wait upon god alone for their teaching and to learn of him at his own mouth and light in silence in all subjection not making such a noise as ye empty casks do in your busie brains about formal set times set by the will of man for expositions and interpretations nor in tumbling ore of tomes bulkie books and contentious commentators or your selves and your university schollers that make such an infinite ado in your inventions about interpreting things sometimes that would be ten fold plainner then they now are if natural schoolmen had let them alone who when in aperto facili posita est salus the way to life lyes as plainly laid down and declared by the letter in a thousand places as it does in that one tit so that there need be no such heaps of books as there are more bulky then all the bible to open some one small book of it do draw cloudes over the clear face of it by interposing and imposing on people the thicket of your own thoughts and darken the open counsel of it by your writings without end and by your words without knowledge

say which of these two the quakers or your schollers bring forth fruits most meet for god and like those of the spirit peace meeknesse patience

temperance gal

let them be the good trees and so known and owned to be by their fiuits and let them be the true flock of christ and be by us as am sure such are by himself accounted as his sheepfold

and which abounds most in those fruits and works of the flesh there spoken of also viz uncleannesse lasciviousnesse wrath hatred drunkennesse revellings and such like and which wallows most in that kind of mire let them be the hogs and swine and not christs flock and fold but he held hence forward for a
now for my part if were to judge by what fruits have come forth in and from our two nurseries of religion of latter years and as well in and from oxford it self as cambridge and how many of them in the time of i.o's
there knows as well as even such as are not sit to be named among christians and what fruits of righteousnesse have been found among the quakers both there and elsewhere who have suffered innocently and as to rendering evil for evil patiently under them and others could quickly determine the matter but sith its like i.o will hardly let me be judge in my own case lest cleave too much to my own cause and company let such books as are extant of the schollers misdemeanours against the quakers in their own meetings who have been alwayes bound to their good behaviour towards the other by that of god in their consciences in the midst of all their abuses to the quakers and then let all men judge which generation of men the quakers or university schollers and their respective assemblies do most exactly resemble the deportment of swine in their
besides those sundry relations that are extant in print of the imprisonments whippings and other persecutions of the innocent servants of the lords sending among them to warn them of their wickednesse at cambridge there are two at least viz one stiled a true testimony of the zeal of the oxford professors and put forth by r.h
and one much more lately under the hands of witnesses stiled a true relation of some of the sufferings inflicted upon the quakers as the fruits of the evil doers viz the proctors and schollars at oxford in which who reads may see the matters of fact to which refer such as are minded to be judges between me and i.o an oxford man in this case who if they be not such as are loath to call their brothers theeves and their sisters swine will assuredly from those and conclude from thence with me the actors and abbettors look much more then like the sheep of christ like foxes and bears and wolves and dogs and wilde boares and swine

however whether it shall stand with i.o or nay it matters not shall from thence infer my conclusion
that if innocency quietnesse patience under sufferings temperance godlinesse reproving wickednesse and becoming fools for christ exposing themselves for truths sake as signs and laughing stocks to an adulterous generation be the characters of such men as the scripture calls swine then that house and family of the quakers is become a but unless turning and tearing and renting and trampling under feet when pearls and holy things are held out to them and devouring and

hurting to death and tying maids arm to arm together and tumbling them into graves and dirting them and dragging them into pools and setting them on their heads with their heels upwards and pumping stifling them mocking stoning scourging putting poor innocent strangers that came in love to truth and them into cages and out of their coasts and haling the quakers out of their own quiet meetings by the hair of their heads and breaking the doors to pieces and windows where quakers meet and carrying away the keys and knocking tenters in the pulling up part of the houses squeezing them in their passing to and fro between the doors turning up the forms and seats where they sit and like wild horses and colts riding upon the backs of men and women and smoaking their roomes with squibs and stamping rudely like in their holy meetings and crying out give us beer and tobacco and wenches and whores and bringing in strong beer and drinking to them and for refusing to pledge throwing it on their cloaths and bands and powring it down their necks and singing bawdy songs and cursing and sweating and such things as would be counted as favouring more of bedlams and swine then saints if quakers should ever have done so in their and obscaene carriage toward women puffing and blowing with in their mouths raising doctrines and uses and points about coblers and tinkers and tobit and his dog offering to put their hands under womens aprons asking if the spirit was not there and many more such filthy stinking sordid actions as hooting yelling laughing any thing to hinder the hearing of what was spoken of truth drawing some into colledges and there most unseemly and inhumanly abusing them and this not only tolerated and connived at by officers that should have punish'd it but also countenanced too much in part by some of them

say unlesse these boarish bruitish gestures cum muliis aliis qua nunc praescribere longum est be the behaviour of christs sheep then for all the uncessant pains of interpreting of the scripture at the of religion and for all i.o's
saying that if what we see and daily hear would sway us we would be ashamed to deny the fruit of expoundings of the scripture to be best where they are most expounded as they are pro forma in the universities as fair and far from it as they seem to be to themselves they look more like to the view of men after gods heart and the children of these mothers more like herds of swine then the places and persons of the people called quakers do among whom there's not such a busling and such a businesse about mens books in order to it nor such clamorous noises about opening the scriptures as is among the scribes that are strangers to them but the words of the wise even of wisdom it self christ iesus are heard in quiet by them that are wise more then the cry of him that ruleth among fools

and as for what fruits of saving knowledge of god and righteousnesse and holinesse of truth are abounding in most academies towns cities and places in all the reformed parts of christendom more or better then is to be seen among turks and heathens unlesse couzening cheating lying drunkennesse and some such like as abound more among christians then turks that

never talk out of the scripture be better hath been seen by some quakers and how the name of christian stinks more then it would do among the gentiles for the sake of such as preach and hear and read and expound and boast of the scripture and yet break them and name the name of christ without his nature but what doings there are in other nations and the preaching places and nurseries thereof to which these of our nation are not inferiour in silth shall say no more here but let them passe as matters which being extra nos are parum or nihil or miaus ad nos of lesse moment to us then our own concluding my return to this particular challenge of i.o with his own words mutatis mutandis additis addendis a little amplified and the subjects or persons of whom they are spoken altered and substituting our modern academies and their masters doctors divines and other students and the whole rabble of rabbies there in the room of that university at tiberias which talks against in the words of one dr lightfoot together with his own and the iewish rabbies gemarists and massorites pertaining thereunto as they are to be read in the pages of i.o's
english part the censure he passes upon them being no other then what exactly accrews to the universities universally throughout christendom from whence come the whole crew of that count themselves and are counted to be the clearers of christs truth to all other christian creatures and what sayes of the massorites of that accademy is a clear character of these corrupted and earth corrupting coveats

whilst they keep the scriptures we shall never want weapons out of their own armoury for their destruction like the philistine they carry the weapon that will serve to cut off their own heads
let us then a little without prejudice or passion consider who or what these men are who are the supposed authors of all knowledge and godlinesse

men they are who have not the word of god committed to them in a pecullar manner as their forefathers prophets and apostles had of old and many have now being no part of his church or people but are only outwardly professors and possessors of the letter without just right or title to it utterly uninteressed in the promise of the communication of the spirit while they so have it which is the great charter of the churches preservation of truth isa

men so remote from a right understanding of the word or the mind and will of god therein that they are desperately engaged to oppose his truth in the books which themselves enjoy in all matters of importance unto the glory of god or the good of their own souls from the beginning to the ending scuffling for the book itself but persecuting the life in them where it is the foundation of whose religion is infidelity and one of their chief fundamentals an opposition to the gospel in the quakers whom they glory to fight against and think they serve god in opposing with what spite they can

men under the special curse of god and his vengeance upon the account of the blood of his dear son in his saints

men all their dayes feeding themselves with vain fables and mischievous devices against the gospel labouring to set up a new religion under the name of the old when the old they hate as ier
in despight of god so striving to wrestle it out with his curse to the utmost

men of a profound

ignorance in all manner of learning knowledge but only what concerns their own dunghil traditions as appears in their stories filled with innumerable sopperies

men so addicted to such monstrous figments as appears in their talmuds as their successors of after ages will be ashamed of yea for the most part idolaters
now dare leave it to the iudgement of any godly prudent person not addicted to parties and names who is at all acquainted with the importance not of the hebrew vowels and accents but the light and spirit the quakers call to unto the right understanding of the scripture with whatever influence their present fixation hath into the literal sense they not knowing the spiritual embrace whether we have not very clear evidence and testimony yea undeniable and unquestionable to cast the rise and spring of all the irreligion in the nations upon this sort of men so far are they from bettering things by their interpretations

recount pray from the first foundation of universities throw christendom and what do you find but a sort of men being made mad with or above the pharisees bewitching and bewitched with traditions blind crafty raging pardon me not for shall ask none if say magical if simon magus was so in thinking the holy ghost of god is to be bought with money monstrous what fools what sots as to such a divine work as the gospel read and consider how to every good work voyd of iudgement the great doctors among them do behave themselves how seriously they do of nothing how childish they are in serious things how much deceitfulnesse froth venome smoke nothing is in their disputations insomuch that may say truly of these as i.o sayes of all men pag
those whose lips should keep knowledge that is and as much as any are by nature so vain foolish malicious such lyars adders detracters have spirits and minds so unsuited to spiritual things so lyable to alteration in themselves and to contradiction one to another are so given to impostures and are so apt to be imposed upon have been so shuffled and driven up and down the world in every generation have for the most part so utterly lost the remembrance of what themselves are whence they come or whether they are to go that can give very little credit to what have nothing but their authority to rely upon for without any evidence from the nature of the thing its self

having cleared the quakers from sundry of those calumnies thou falsly castest as concerning their carriage toward the scriptures as if they were enemies haters and reproachers of it and who in truth are its truest friends in the former chapter come on to consider some of thy cloudy conjectures and conceits concerning the bounds of the canon as ye call it thereof the hebrew punctation and thy asserted integrity of both that and the greek texts of it without any variation to a very title concerning the canon of which thou writest as follows

john owen
pag
god spake of old or formerly in the prophets from the dayes of moses and downwards unto the bounding and consignation of the canon delivered to the judaical church in the dayes of ezra and his companions the men of the great congregation
reply

why sayest thou from moses downward as if he had never done so before till then did not god speak in his prophets and by them to the men of their several ages from moses upwards as well as from moses downwards did he not speak in enooh the seventh from adam in noah in abraham isaac iacob lot and iob who lived before moses if catholick tradition be to be credited in one thing as well as another and whose book who ever pen'd it whether himself or some other for ought thou knowest was written before who thou thinkest wrote the first of the scripture either lived or wrote and by them who were upright righteous just and walked with god to the wicked unrighteous worldlings and wantons who walked with the devil in their generations who all were before moses as well as by moses and those that lived after him


why sayest thou downwards to the consignation and bounding of the canon in ezra's days as if between his dayes and the dayes of christs flesh the spirit of the lord was straitned as it never is mic
and god had limitted and bound up himself from manifesting his mind cut of his own mouth to any men at all for so many hundred years together because some prophets had been moved by him to commit to writing or at least to permit to be written by

others some few of those things they

saw and said concerning partly their own and partly the after times and other nations doth not wisdom say of her self that in all ages entering into holy souls she maketh them friends of god and prophets wisd
and were there no holy men of god in those dayes wherein ye imagine all gods speaking in and by any prophets then was ceased in and by whom he manifested his mind as he moved them to speak and write as immediately as he had done others before them

and who told thee that the canon as thou call'st it or full standing rule of tryal or infallible of the old testament scripture to which nothing must or might be added after it till the time of christ in the flesh was compleated and after its consignation and bounding by them delivered to the judaical church in the dayes of ezra alias esdras and his companions the men as of your own heads ye are pleased to term them of the great congregation whence hast thou these fancies of thine or suppose they be not simply suppositions but real truths whence dost thou fetch or take them to be so but from the of thy forefathers and such iewes as are little lesse then unerring oracles with thee when saying ought that suits with thee yea thou callest pag
the assertion of iustin martyr of the iewes corrupting the bible out of their hatred to christians an incredible figment yet little better but much worse then ordinary infidels men feeding themselvns with vain fables desperate cursed opposers of truth mischievous in their devices against the gospel of a profound ignorance in all manner of learning and knowledge but only what concerns their own dunghil traditions addicted to monstrous figments bewitching bewitched with traditions idolaters magicians blind crafty raging fools sets full of deceitfulness froth venome smoke nothing but faithlesnesse and infidelity it self what not thats nought where any thing issues from their most catholick testimony that makes against thee pag yea whence knowest thou who art easily apt to question when it serves thee so to do whether there ever were such men as the
and such men as the tiberian massorites in rerum natura pag
that ever there was such a thing in rerum naturâ as that great congregation thou art every where in thy book so greatly taken with and ever and anon betaking thy self to for refuge but only from thy putting more confidence in thy own uncertain conjectures together with the catholick tradition of the with thee creditlesse iewes and christians then in the conjectures of the prolegomenâ as learned as thy self at least who oppose thee in it for theres not so much as any scripture at all that mentions such a set sanydrim of ezra nehemia ioshua zacharia haggai as thou settest it down in the book of thy own brain and the of thy own conceit that there was pag

and let it be as it can be no more then imagined there was such a great congregation which it being as not possible to know it so nor here nor there to mine or any mans salvation i'le not search into so far as to put my self into any capacity of either saying or gain saying it that there was and to ground any as does many things upon its being so as he but thinks is as he sayes in another case pag to build towns and castles of imaginations which may be as easily cast down as they are erected yet

when alls done whence had that sanydrim such authority as to confine and bound out that canon and canonize some of the writings of such prophets as ye wot are canonical and cashiere the rest of the writings of the same prophets and all the writings of some other prophets as of no such divine authority as to command with their fellows in gods name as his word and to abrogate them as apocryphal as ye speak and disband them from the bench of iudicature and to bind the sweet influences of the holy spirit so as to say spirit of god be silent now blow no more nor make any more prophets now for these many hundred years to come but become subject thy self to be tryed by the touchstone of the writings of such prophets as thou hast already moved to write gods mind or so many at least as it seems good to us now to authorize and establish into a standard for the tryal of thy self as well as all false spirits

and if say as he does pag
that was not called the great congregation from its number but eminency of persons yet say are any persons so eminent if i.o be not a lyar pag
as to have authority from god to authorize and canonize casting aside what they like not what seems good to them into the name to bespeak in his own feigned phrase of the word of god that they themselves must be subject to the authority of and of the rule that themselves must be ruled by and of the foundation that themselves and all others must be built on and of the basis of their own belief it is indeed quoth i.o pag
a contradiction for men to say and if for other men then for i.o say who sayes the same yet sees it not they give authority to the scriptures they bound the canon and deliver to the church what it shall be which it hath antecedently to their charter and concession

and again moreover to say the same of his supposed sanydrim that sayes to the digrading of the septuagint from that high conceit some have of them and eminent account some have them in pag
if the ability of the men be granted yet what security have we of their principles and honesty oh much every way thinks i.o for though when he is pleased to speak diminitively of men the care and fidelity and pains of whom in translating we have as good ground to believe was as great to the full as any of that of those he commends in transcribing he disparages it into oscitancy inadvertency negligence ignorance the wisest not seeing all and such like pag
yet when he speaks of the care pains and fidelity of men in transcribing which is a work as lyable to mistakes as the other that he may keep up the honour however of his infallible transcripts to this day then he utters himself more hyperbolically and as for ezra and his conjectured companions he makes their labour to reform the church and all the corruptions crept into the word as he speaks though if the letter were the word it were not lyable to corruption little lesse then monstrous and their care in restoring the scripture to its purity mark extraordinary pag
yea of the points which yet he is to prove coaevous with the consonants and as old as any scripture
doubt not quoth he but of that we shall yet manifest that they were compleated it should seem then that every tittle is not now at first giving out of the letter if the vowels were incompleate till esdros dayes

by the men of the great synagogue ezra and his companions guided by the infallible direction of the spirit of god

might as does often beg or take it crave leave to answer this conjecture with another pag
and fling back i.o's
as well as d's fortè ita with so much at least as fortè non but ipse dixit j.o sayes he doubts not their infallibility so who had rather be silent then disparage ezra will add no more to os rex sum then nil ultrae quaeio plebeius
and now am upon a consideration of the canon of the scripture let me here make an end with thee i.o as concerning this cogitation of thine about the consignation of the canon of both the old and that thou callest the new testament of which new thou sayest pag
that what thou hadst spoken of the scripture of the old testament viz as to its immediate emanation from god and its being canonized together with it into a standard the same must be also affirmed of the new with this addition of advantage and preheminence above the old that it began to be spoken by the himself

and as for thy canon of the outward scriptures of both sorts one of which thou callest the old the other the new testament after the bounding
compleating and consignation of which in their respective junctures and seasons and the delivery of it so canonized to the church or churches respectively as their eternal infallible touchstone rule foundation testimony standard no more must be owned on such a high account as its authorized into as of divine original nor be added by either god or man while the world stands

would sain find from thee if yet thou art able thy self to fathom to the bottom of thy own faith or rather fancy in this point where thou findest and whence thou foundest all thy confused communications and crude conceptions about this canonization of such and such outward parcels of holy mens writings into a rule or standard and disfranchizing such and such of others as holy as those from a standing within the bounds of this magna charta that certain synods and supposed sanydrims of thou knowest not whom have given and do as thou deemest give and grant thereunto together with them where learnest thou all these lessons but from the lectures and lying legends and voluminous lexicons of the illiterate literatists of the world that are alwayes laying on and loading one another with their endlesse boundlesse and bottomlesse scribles about the outward original text and transcriptions and translations of the scripture in their tedious tomes talmuds and talmudical traditions till they are lost from the very letter much more the life it calls to so that they have no leasure to live or learn others to live thereafter in the inextricable laborynth of their own labours about it who leads thee into the vain imaginations of these things but thy own and other mens well nigh innumerable and invincible inventions what tangles thee and others in such trifling talkings and treatings one to another of things that none of ye all can have any infallible evidence or

yield to any infallible assurance of but a croud of conceits and catholick traditions with which the world and ye in it are so overcharged that ye cannot contain them now without infinite frothy and fruitlesse contendings about them and obtruding your own observances imposing your own supposings and thrusting each upon other your own bare thoughts of things that ne flocci facit it amounts not to the value of a lock of wooll as to salvation whether they be known or not till being throng'd and thrust into the thorny thicket of your own thoughts you there tear one another to pieces about the scripture insomuch that truly may and plainly shall be so bold as flatly to contradict what thou sayest falsly of thy canon and standard since the closing and compleating of it that tis a means to end all strife it is rather throw the folly of its ministers the means of all strife and confusion in the christian world

thou sayest indeed of the writings of the old testament that the canon thereof had its consignation bounding and delivery to the church as its rule so that from thenceforth nothing written either from moses upward or to christs time downward must be admitted to be owned as canonical or inspired scripture and thou sayest pag
that god who himself began the writings of the word with his own finger after he had spoken it appointing and approving the writing of the rest that followed i.e from genesis to the revelation as they are ordinarily numerated in our bibles except the books called apocrypha for reckon all those are reckoned by thee as the books thou speakest of epist
ded pag
never indited by the holy spirit as remote from being undefined span alphabet doth lastly command the close of the immediate revelation of his will to be written in a book rev and so gives out the whole of his mind and counsel unto us in writing as a merciful and stedfast relief against all confusion darknesse and uncertainty but what a relief it is against confusion shall shew more hereafter
and as to thy scriptures canonization or the consignation compleating bounding of the canon of it a few words here about the manner and means and true bounds thereof for as to the question whether it be a canon that is a rule at all yea or not may defer it also to another place let me expostulate with thee yet more about it yet how and by whom your standard comes to be so bounded as ye say it is and to be limited to those demensions of latitude longitude and profundity that ad amussim exact measure heighth depth length and breadth that is allotted to it as without the apocripha it stands bound up within your late bound bibles mean that such and such parcels prophesies proverbs histories epistles holy sentences sacred sayings shall stand owned honoured signed and authorized with the sacred high and holy titles of gods word gods witnesse foundation rule inalterable standard and not one piece of holy writing more or lesse then those already so consecrated and canonized so that such and such puta those that ye now commonly call canonical shall shand as the standard and all others viz those called apocryphal and whatever are mentioned in that scripture ye so own shall stand out of and off from it as no part of the standard while the world stands

who was it was it god or was it man that set such distinct bounds to the scripture so as to say such and such a set number of books viz
those those that are sum'd up together before your bibles excepting the apocrypha which stands between them shall be owned as canonical and the rest though such as were of the same divine inspiration be rejected as humane and no otherwise accounted on then other meer mens writings not to be received with such high respect as the other whence hast thou this conceit that god himself commanded the close of the canon of the old testament to be malachi and the bounds of it to consist of such books of the prophets as ye now have exclusively of such prophesies therein mentioned as ye have not and the close of the canon of the new to be the revelation and the bulk of it to be those few histories and apostolical epistles as ye have exclusively of such even therein mentioned as ye have not who was it that said to the spirit of god spirit blow no more inspire no more men make no more prophets from ezra's dayes and downwards till christ and from iohns dayes downward for ever but cease be silent and subject thy self as well as all evil spirits to be tryed by the standard thats made up of some of the writings of some of those men thou hast moved to write already and let such and such of them as are bound up in the bibles now used in england be the only means of measuring all truth for ever

who was it god or man the spirit in the scripture it self or the scribes in their synods councels and consistories that so authorized or canonized these and expunged those was it not meer men in their imaginations doth the scripture do the spirit and the apostles therein give any order for or make any such mention in the least of such a matter is it not meer man in his imaginations that hath taken upon him according to the good or ill conceit that he hath taken to him of these or those respectively to say which thou sayest is a contradiction to say he will give authority to the scriptures is it not man in his proud mind that comes in with his sic volo sic iubeo so l'le have it thus it shall be saying to the books of scripture as god sayes to the waves of the outward ocean hitherto shall ye come and no further so many of the prophets and apostles writings shall be in the authority nature vse and office of the supream determiner of all truth for ever and all others even such as are written by the same men in the motion of the same spirits shall be but as common mens writings and be look'd on afar off as apocryphal i.e hidden or unknown writings that no such notice shall be of as of the other

and as for the books which ye sprinkle with that name of apocryphal and give leave to to have a standing with it but not so as to make any part of your standard what think ye of them upon second thoughts are they fit for nothing but to be cashiered and cast out of your canon by whole sale by tradition one from another without trying them is there nothing among them that may be judiciously iudged to be of as divine an original and authority as some of those particular letters to private men as that of paul to philemon about private personal or domestick matters which ye own in such a transcendent manner as ye do surely if some of hem be fictitious or fabulous or but humane so that ye will say no better of

them then vox hominem sonat yet is there none or nothing among them all that is to be noted or counted upon as of divine authority and original and of as efficacy as some of those ye own none that ye can see cause to sign meliore lapillo with some better name then ye vouchsafe them and standing in the church then ye allow them as if they were a certain mongrel seed between that of canaan and ashdod that ye know not well what to make of nor how to entreat so ill altogether as not to afford them a middle place in some of your bibles between the old testament writings and those ye call the new nor yet so well as to entertain them into your canon neither

surely there be some of them which when ye look them over again not so cursorily as to them as ye ordinarily do ye may find ground to receive as such as have as fair a stamp of the beaming majesty truth holinesse and authority of god and his spirit as some at least not to say the most of those ye ascribe to god as their main or only author and that do favour as much of i.o's so much insisted on as some other historical doctrinal and prophetical parts of your acknowledged divinely derived scripture do of which what infidels soever ye are as concerning them yet together with many others whereof some are as book learn'd as your selves can say credo equidem nec vana fides genus esse deorum
tis indeed the faith or rather infidelity of such as call themselves reformed churches that all those books called the apocrypha without exception are in no wise of such divine original as them ye call canonical but who first set the one upon the bench and the other at the bar am yet to learn but this know that howbeit ye second their depression and digradation of the one so far below the other yet as neither one nor t'other were ever canonized by god himself if we speak of the outward text only about which my businesse with i.o lyes into that name of his word and into the authority of the foundation of faith the infallible rule of interpretation of itself of tryal and examination of spirits doctrines of the supream iudge also by which all controversies of religion are to be determined the only pure authentical standard unto which the church is finally to appeal in whose sentence it is to rest into which all faith is finally to be resolved so if such synods of men either antient or modern as have shouldred out all those at once from sharing with the other writings in what they can lay just claim to had been as spiritually discerning as they were spiritually blind shallow and undiscerning they would have seen cause to have joyned some at least of those apocryhal scriptures to an equal participation of that plea of divine original and inspiration with the rest as without cause they justled them all out from it by their joynt consent

and though it be the declared faith of that assembly of divines that both houses of parliament advised with
and of the congregational churches in england whose confession is put out this instant
as to that article about the scriptures word for word in the same words with the other that the books commonly called apocrypha not being of divine inspiration are no part of the canon of the scriptures and therefore are of no authority

in the church of god nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of then other humane writings yet this declare to the whole world as my faith concerning them that though own neither them nor the best bare wriing or outward text or letter of the other scripture at so high a rate as i.o does who makes the naked letter in all things equivolent to the holy matter yet whatever is truly to be praedicated of the one or can solidly be pleaded on the behalf of the one which ye call your canon as to the divinity of their original the same may be pleaded on the behalf of not a few of the other

and as they all that in general are stilled apocryphal can plead their authority from long before the apostles dayes and also the special care and providence of god which is an argument of such weight with i.o and t.d pag
as swayes them not a little into their frivolous faith about the rest in the preservation of them to this very day so that all of them have been kept by the church that kept the rest bound up and translated into various languages and as publickly allowed to be publickly read as the rest and highly esteemed by austin and other fathers ye divines cannot easily be ignorant
and as for sundry of them ye are ignorant with a witnesse if ye see them to be as ye say they are not of divine inspiration or see them not to be of as divine an original as some or even any of the other which ye own so to be
as for that fourth book of esdras which is but the second as it stands in the apocrypha besides that its acknowledged by clem alexandrinus faber and many more men of renown among you and by many holy men in these latter times as well learned as your selves at least in the wisdom of gods spirit to be written by his immediate inspiration so is it such a plain prophecy consistent of many particular praedictions of things to be fulfilled in these last ages as the like to it or a least clearer is hardly to be found in all the scripture besides it insomuch that he who reads it in the chapters of it and some other places and sees not the beams of a divine majesty in it and sees not the matters now managing upon the stage in the world that are there foretold in it reads not in the light of that holy spirit that moved in the writing both of that and all other holy scripture and may come before he is well aware to feel ere long the dint of that divine displeasure that is denounced against the sinners of the latter ages and thereby come to be convinced of the divinity and truth of that scripture which our divines that usually see altogether by the lump and are loath to see any truth sigillatim till they are all made to see it whether they will or no will hardly yield to if they be their till very necessity forces and frights them into the faith of it

and the same may be said as to the divine original of ieremiahs epistle which was written and sent to them that were to go captive into babylon and of ecclesiasticus and the wisdom of solomon which favours so much of the wisdom of the spirit that he is yet in that wisdom only which is from beneath which is earthly animal deceitful who doth not acknowledge the finger of god writing those deep and precious truths and praedictions in the heart of him whose hand was the committer of them to

outward writing which whether it were not solomon after whom it was so entituled nil ultra quaero he uttered proverbs whereof scarce are extant in that book of his proverbs some of which as standing inserted there in the hebrew text are not the original copy but a transcript only at best out of that or some second hand copies taken and copied cut long after solomons dayes by the men of hezekiah or generations from him prov
the chapter of which book also are the words of one the son of iaketh but sure am that book of wisdom was inspired or breathed into the penman that expired or breathed it out from no lesse then that wisdom which is from above

the main argument that ever have seen against the divine original of these books are first their being not written in the hebrew tongue which what a poor pedling piece of disproof it is he is no wiser then he should be that does not see for what warrant is there that all that was not pen'd in the hebrew tongue is no scripture of divine inspiration or if there be is it not as conclusive against much of the scripture which i.o counts canonical the whole of wch he reckons at random was wrote in the hebrew tongue since its evident that much of that book of hester chapters and verses of which are set among the canonical scripture and oh the wisdom the other chapters and verses of the chapter by you choppers and changers because written in greek are reckoned and rank'd with the apocryphal was written not in the hebrew but in the caldee as much of ezra nehemiah and daniel also were
and besides if being written originally in the hebrew will avail toward the evincing of them to be canonical this will help some of your apocrypha into your canon since that of tobit or tobias is not only as that of also is the holy man that wrote much for that prophet and of that prophecy of ieremiah most pretiously both doctrinal and prophetical but also extant in the hebrew as well as greek and latine and that of ecclesiasticus was written originally in hebrew witnesse iesus the son of syrach who himself confesseth in his prologue he translated it out of the hebrew text and if ye say thats but a translation then at best and so not canonical scripture reply two things thereto

first this argues ad hominem against then tittles and iotaes of the hebrew text are lost since the giving out thereof at first
secondly that either translation must be owned as canonical with you as well as the first original manuscripts and your original transcripts or else it must be concluded what ever you linguists have yet the people that live upon your lips not being able to read hebrew and greek have no canonical scripture at all to read

the second argument that is supposed to be of weight against the divine original of the apocryphal scriptures broughton in his sinai sights touches upon them both is because no writers in the new testament cite or quote any of them any otherwise then they do heathen authors

but marvel not fith the wise men are to be befooled that prudent broughton should be so blind as not to see how paul heb

besides many other passages in the scriptures of the new testament but especially in the revelation relate to their paralels in that second book of esdras which is the fourth at least of that man ezra or esdras his writing whereof that some should be received as of divine original and some that have as truly spiritual a tincture on them as the other or any in all the scripture as that fourth of esdras hath wherein also he declares his visions and revelations he had from god in which he would not sain and lye for then he were not fit to have his two first books owned as from god should be rejected as meerly humane see not any solid ground for it yet such is the divine wisdom of our meer humane divines that two of that same mans books who wrote all the four for the identity of the person that pen'd them all every believer may easily believe are canonized as divine and the other two condemned as but humane

thus though i.o prates so much for the whole book of gods being providentially preserved so that we may have full assurance that we enjoy the whole revelation of his will that is with him all the writings that ever were written by inspiration from the spirit fit to stand among those that he makes the standard in the copies abiding amongst us and contends that the whole scripture entire as given out from god without any losse of so much as one letter tittle or iota remains and is preserved in the copies yet extant among us to this day which is that in which having at first over shot himself in blindly bolting it out rather then endure that honourable shame of owning his own ignorance he as blindly posts on to maintain pag
yet upon know not what frivolous conceits and prejudicate surmises possessing the minds of himself and his brethren of both the convocational and the congregational way among which blind custome more then clear sight believe to be none of the least which are so far from enjoying the whole book of scripture wherein the mind and vvill of god lyes declared by his own inspiration of the penmen that no small part of that scripture that was written by men divinely inspired and so providentially preserved he refuses to enjoy or own as of such divine descent from god as other parts of the scripture are but rejects and contemnes it as apocryphal that is so altogether hidden from him that he knows not very well what to make on't

but suppose he should own and take all the apocryphal writings into his standard and canon as he calls it of the scriptures does that and all the rest both old and new that are bound up in old english bibles with it constitute the utmost bounds of his canon doth his standard stand in so little room is it closed within so narrow a corner consists it of so few so small a company of holy mens writings and scriptures as are comprehended in no greater a compasse then that book called the bible contains to is that the whole book of god the whole outward declaration of his will by the writings of holy men at his own motion the whole scripture entire that was ever so given out from god without any losse of any of the integral parts of it so much as of one letter tittle or iota is all extant all remaining all preserved to this day that

was written by holy men as moved by the holy spirit and is that all of the inspired scripture which we now have and enjoy in our present bibles was there no more of the old testament scripture then the apocrypha and that which is commonly counted to the canon and is the revelation the close of the immediate revelation of his will to holy men and of his moving them to write it out by his holy spirit num tam

pellibus exiguis arctatur spiritus ingens
two things i.o at least have to say to the contrary

first that is not all of the old nor all of the new scriptures that were by inspiration written before christ and after him to the same use ends and purposes as the rest were written until iohns writing the revelation
secondly that as there was much more then that ye wot of which was written as the spirit moved from moses to the revelation so there hath been more since then so written and more is and will yet be in time to come before as near as it is to it the world that now waxes old towards it be at an end

first there's not all in your bibles by much and by how much who knows that was given out upon inspiration of god when as to say nothing of the testament of the twelve patriarchs now extant there is not all the inspired scripture by much which that inspired scripture ye have makes mention of

where's the book of nathan the prophet the book of ahijah the book of iddo chron

the book of shemaiah chron

the book of iehu the prophet chron
king the book of gad the seer chron

the book of iasher sam


of which it may well be supposed that he was a very antient writer since those that wrote ioshua who ere they were for himself it was not that wrote it all at least as moses not all deuteronomie unlesse he wrote of his own death and burial before he died see iosh
do quote him iosh

where's that part of ieremiah the prophet wherein he spake that which matthew cites matth

about the giving the pieces of silver the price that christ was sold at for the potters field for howbeit zachary the prophet zach
speaks of the same thing who was in his work an exalier of god in his time which the name ieremiah seems to signifie and so may be called ieremiah which is not likely to be matthews meaning yet in all the prophesies of ieremie extant in your bibles theres no such thing spoken and for you to say either that matthew was mistaken quoting throw forgetfulness one prophet for another or that the transcribers of the copies of their original out of matthews original copy failed so fowlly in their transcribings for all your copies that ever saw so read as to write ieremie for zachary will be for i.o upon his principles who stands to plead every letter tittle and iota that was in the undefined span alphabet to be now in the undefined span alphabet as sorry a shift and miserable remedy as he makes for himself and finds who leaps out of the frying pan into the fire

where's the prophecy of enoch spoken of iude
out of whose prophesie the iewes can tell you more then ye wot of from that of iude and as for ezra or esdras and his true companions of whom thou sayest truly enough if not truer then thou art aware of that their care in restoring the scripture to its purity when it had met with the greatest tryal that it ever underwent in this world considering the paucity of the copies then extant was great and that the consignation and bounding of the canon delivered to the judaical church was in their dayes and that they did labour to reform all the corruptions crept into the word of god

and that they compleated the punctation the compleatnesse of which then was not coaevous with the text as at first written in hebrew as thou contendest to the consuring of thy self here and that they were guided herein by the infallible direction of the spirit of god pag



did not they in the spirit and power of god write many more books even
most of which are not in your bibles read esdras
throughout the chapter where are all these and sundry more scriptures some as and some more antient then moses of which will not now speak particularly

and as to the new where is that first epistle of paul to the corinthians mentioned in the first of those two that we have cor
and that first epistle of his to the ephesians for its evident he wrote one to them before that mentioned in that one which ye have ephes
and that epistle of his to the laodiceans mentioned col besides several to seneca neros tutor and other of pauls writings who was doubtlesse far more voluminous in his writings then that poor pittance of epistles to churches and ministers and the letters to philemona tradesman about a domestick businesse of receiving his servant onesimus that had ben unserviceable to him amounts to of whole spiritual scriptures and speeches that fell from him at his martyrdom that were taken by such as were present at it some in these dayes have seen more then that which was written of him by luke in the acts and written by him in the epistles ye count a part of your canon

and whether that which iohn wrote to the church mentioned by him in the vers of his letter to gaius were no other then the first of those three recorded and whether that of iude whereof iude
he sayes in the praeterimperfect tense when gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation

it was needful for me to write unto you were not one he wrote before this which was now but under his hands is more then all you sayers of what ye think only are able groundedly to
and whether clements epistle whose name was in the book of life

and that church of rome to corinth wrote years after pauls may not challenge to be ranck'd among the rest is worth your enquiry and what think ye of that sweet shorr pretious reply of christ iesus himself in his letter to agbarus king of edessa who wrote so loving'y and beleevingly to him about the malady that lay upon him as it stood recorded in the roles of that city and may do still for ought ye know which is to be read and many other pretious passages about that businesse in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius pamphilius is it not as christian as divinum spiritum non hominem sapiens and worthy as particular as it is to stand in your standard and claim a room in your canon as that particular letter of paul to philemon

what is become say of all these and more then may now be mentioned none of which is within the confines of your congregationally constituted synodically composed ecclesiastically authorized clerically conceived canon
were they not divinely inspired that were to render doubtful your undoubted divine original of what you have since some of them are quoted in these you have


are they all utterly lost that were to loose himself much more in his cause who is lost too much already for i.o to say so sith more then undefined span alphabet one jot or one tittle is then passed away and perished from the law if the letter be it not one jot or one tittle of which letter quoth i.o wofully that of matth
for the lotaes and tittles of the meer text and letter which christ utters only of the doctrine truth and holy matter of the law is to passe away till heaven and earth which are yet standing are past away


or did not god himselfe intend to dignifie these with the same honour and crown them with so high an account as those though as well descended and as immediately derived from him as the rest or did he not design them to the same spiritual ends and renowned uses with their fellows


or were these books out of the way and not present at the time and place of the first setting up of your standard by such synods and sanydrims as took on them to stablish sign seal and authorize what scriptures of the prophets and apostles should and what should not stand under that honourable title of the stedfast standard and so were censured and sentenced for ever for not appearing at that sacred session and high court of iudicature which was to iudge what books should be from the supream iudge to which all should appeal in all cases and in whose sentence all should rest and all faith be finally resolved and not coming in at the compleating consignation bounding and final closing of the canon should for ever iure or apostatico and in foro hominum forfeit that originally equal title which in foro dei iure christico and apostolico they else had to be canonized with their fellows

ah poor men it pities me to see how ye dream together in the dark and mope up and down in your own misty imaginations about your original texts and external letter leaving the original truth it self which was before your texts were ever talk'd on or had a being in the world turning your backs on that internal light in the heart which all the tendency of of your letter is to turn men to and from which your scripture originally had its being
it irks me to see how for want of betaking your selves to the measure of the light that shines in your own consciences that infallibly would lead you to that which is the end of all scriptures and words spoken or written as from god viz honesty and righteousnesse truth and acceptation with god and holy men ye trace to and fro till ye tire your selves in the perplexing track and endlesse round of your own meer thoughts about a thing which the more ye try the more ye tangle your selves about it and the more ye look after it and in it in the way ye look into your beloved letter the more ye loose your selves in it and about it till at last you will eternally loose both it and your selves too by not looking to the light at all even no lesse then altogether see epist

now as to the four wayes by way of query above propounded which of them all i.o means to answer by who talks so much about the closure compleating consignation and bounding of the standard and scripture canon cant well say but as for t.d with whom have somewhat to do and to deal alittle here he replyes affirmitively to the third among them saying pag of the first epistle of paul to the corinthians mentioned in that first of ours and so consequently of all the several scriptures that are not bound up in your bibles which asserted to be as much a rule as those ye have that they were not intended as much for your rule as those in your books
to whom when replyed at the dispute with him as he there relates thus viz
if that epistle was wriiten to the same end with those we have as it was viz to instruct the corinthians how to carry themselves to grosse sinners cor
compared with vers
ii
wrote unto you not to company and now have written unto you not to keep company and the same was said of his first to the ephesians i.e that it was to the self same end as that we have ephes

as wrote before that ye may understand my knowledge in the mistery of christ so now then twas intended as much for a rule as the other but it was written to the same end ergo if one a rule then the other
t.d denies the consequence saying sermons private religious discourses have the same common end with the written scriptures yet the later only are our standing rule the former our rule but so far as they agree with the later in the scripture

reply
which reply of t.d's is so unreasonably ridiculcus that he is

scarce animal rationale risibile that receives and entertains it seriously as the truth

for first it supposes as if pauls first writing to the corinthians were not written scriptures as well as the rest we have but an orall discourse

secondly it supposes pau's first epistle of all to that church which was cited by himself in his second as written to the same end and was written in the same spirit of god in which he lived and walk'd and out of whose movings he wrote no epistles to the churches

was fit to stand in no other account then the sermons and private religious discourses of our and their common christians which must stand or fall as they square or not square with the standard of scripture and as if the seniour epistles of paul to corinth and ephesus must like prisoners at the bar receive their sentence of guilty or not guilty worthy or not worthy to be owned as a part of the rule or canon by their iuniours or such as were sent after them to sit as iudges of them at the bench and so hereby his reply is as it were an affirmative answer to the first of my four queries viz
that pauls writings were not all alike of divine original and inspiration but some epistles to the churches of his were uttered as he was moved by the holy spirit undefined span alphabet and others undefined span alphabet of private interpretation or as private mens writings
credat apella

and when twas urged by me that there was no more evidence or character of these epistles being a rule which are then of those which are not in your books then t.d seeing what he had replyed that way would not hold replyes by way of answer to the second of my four last queries affirming that pauls first writings to corinth and ephesus were lost when those we have are saved and so makes this distinction of the ones being perished the other preserved by gods providence watching over them when he did not over the other a signal evidence that god intended the one for a standing rule to us and not the other and herein he and i.o jump together and border pretty near one another sith i.o insists exceedingly as an argument of their being a rule in the church on this businesse of gods preservation of every tittle and iota of divinely inspired scripture to this day whereby he implicitly denies all the that are not in your bibles to be any of them of divine inspiration but with this difference from t.d that i.o sayes not a tittle of the inspired scripture is lost t.d to the confuting of i.o confesses being believe informed of some holy scripture at the dispute which he knew not of before that not only tittles and iotaes but some whole books of which he dares not say expresly though intimate it he doth in the head next above spoken to that they were not divinely inspired are lost and perished out of the world so that the preservation of what is preserved is made a signal token that

its to be our rule and the losse of whats lost that that was not written for such an end

to which signal token of gods intending the one and not the her for a rule when replyed as tis transiently done above to touching the books called apocrypha that there is more antient holy writ remaining extant to this day preserved for our use by gods providence then ye own or honour with a standing in your standard instancing in the epistle of paul to laodicea then by and by t.d who rides the rounds not much lesse then i.o and is never positive nor steady to any thing he asserts so as to stand long to it without shifting proteus like into another shape when he is ashamed to be seen longer in his old one comes out in a clear contrary gelour and flatly contradicts himself and unsayes what he said but just before and whereas he had made the preserving of what was written and is preserved an argument of its being designed of god for a rule affirms that all that was written by holy men meaning paul among the rest or else he speaks not at all to the purpose and preserved also for our use is not therefore our standing rule thus one while tis so and one while no then neither yet both no and so
pauls three epistles viz the two to corinth one to ephesus that we have appear therefore to be our standing rule because they are preserved to our use to this day but his first of all to corinth and ephesus therefore not so because not preserved theres his first saying
his very next of all is this pauls epistle to laodicea though preserved for our use yet is not therefore to be our standing rule to this day
so what ever pauls epistles are yet am sure pauls life and example is no rule that t.d's
walks by nor i.o neither for his yea was yea and his nay nay he did not use such lightnesse as they both very often do who say nay to that they said yea to just before neither did he speak so according to the flesh as they with whom now theres yea yea and anon to the same thing nay nay but as god is true and christ is not yea and nay in his words and enjoynes us to be steady in our yea and nay so was pauls word in what he spake
and yet the reason t.d renders of his saying no to what he said not no but so just before is as reasonlesse as his self confutation is for mark then quoth he if what ere was written by holy men alluding to paul be therefore our standing rule because preserved the discourses of holy ministers in former and latter times should be our rule which they are not but are to be brought to the written word as our rule and test
in which if by holy ministers in former times he means paul among the rest as he must else he misses the matter then some of pauls epistles are the rule and test which his other epistles must stand bare before to be tryed by which is absurd if by latter ministers he intend such as himself who confesses his ministry to be fallible would have him to know and that he shall find more of anon that pauls ministry and every true ministry that ministers by word of mouth or writing as moved by the holy spirit which moves and leads none fallibly but all infallibly whom it leads was no such fallible ministry as his false one is that it need be tryed by his other own holy writings

but now as to the epistle of laodicea instanced in t.d was so hard of belief and difficult to he perswaded that there was any such at all that if one of sandwich had not stood up and said he had the book wherein we asserted it to be printed we should hardly have gained so much credit among the clergy then present such pro and con they made about it as to have been believed that there was such a thing in being so ignorant are they of some present parts of that scripture they call their rule yet at last twas yielded such a one was extant

but for all that t.d who has ever more wayes then one into the wood where he loves to wander when he is bedged out of it one way will find or make himself a gap into it by another and as to this matter of pavl to laodicea he hath three or four shifts for fear one fail affirming after he had found it translated into english not to but from laodicea

first that for ought we know it might be that first of paul to timothy the of which sayes it was written from laodicea of which which its notorious enough to every novice that neither it nor the other were pen'd by such as wrote the epistles themselves when asked t.d whether he owned it and the rest as canonical or no as canonical quoth he for ought appears yet to me as your epistle to the laodiceans of which epistle yet he had said but just before it might be that of pauls to timothy which yet that it was is so unlikely that tis little lesse then to be like a child to assert it a likely matter indeed that its pauls to timothy meant col
that which paul wrote to timothy was to timothy a particular person about particular matters concerning him as in that capacity of a tim

what should he charge the colosians so much to look after that for or if he had would he not have said see that ye read the epistle to timothy had not that been plainer secondly but seeing that snap t.d fits another string to his instrument and then fidles on in this fashion denying it to be pauls epistle at all either to laodicea or timothy or any one else branding it with the name of one of the brats laid by the popish party at the apostles doors which they will not father and me as a brother of the popish party and an abbettor of them in their wickednesse for fathering it on paul at all

and then thirdly that he might seem to say something though no better then nothing to every thing rather then own any thing for truth before the world be it never so plain that the quakers tell him he bethinks himself and upon second or rather third thoughts adds having perused the judgement of some learned men about it that twas neither pauls to timothy any more then to laodicea nor yet altogether such a brat or bastard brood as a metr chimaera hatcht and bred and sained in the fancies only of the popish party but at least a real epistle yet one that was so far from being pauls to laodicea that it was rather one written by the laodiceans

to paul himself a more incredible pigment then the first for all tis his reverend dr davenports opinion on the place

thus oh the twistings and turnings and and changings and piecirgs and patchings and shiftings and shufflings of t.d to wind himself away from the truth which is to him so intollerable that with i.o bear the shame and run the hazard of giving his incongruous thoughts thick and threefold against it rather then truly turn to it when its truly and uncontroulably told and laid before him as it is in this case about the epistle to laodicea about which he traces to and fro two or three false wayes and yer can scarce tell well which of the three to fix upon or steadily to stand to or stand still in
neverthelesse notwithstanding t.ds advance in three motions against the truth of pau's writing to laodicea yet they help him not but for all his two strides and a iump yet he leaps too short to reach the matter of truth he would resel by it for quid verbis opus est quum facta loquuntur there need no more words in proof on't the epistle of paul to laodica is extant and speaks out it self and its author whose it is as well by the stale and majesty of it as by the superscription being both translated and printed in english as it was found though not in your testaments yet in the oldest bible that was printed at worms and also in a certain antient manuscript of the new testament text which have seen and can produce written in old english years since or above before the art of printing came up here by which its evident that it was owned as canonical in the church of england in those dayes and was however it came to be since left out bound upamong its fellowes
and howbeit it be filled in our english translations of col
the epistle from laodicea besides the genuine sence of the greek which as is shewed above will much rather bear it to then from laodicea yet let it be read from that nothing lessens the likelihood of its being pauls for though he wrote it to laodicea yet if the colossians would read it as paul bids them do as that the laodiceans likewise should read what he wrote to the colossians they must read it in a copy from laodicea whether it was sent or else not at all as the laodiceans it they read that he wrote to the colossians must have it first from colosse or at least a copy of it for as for the scriptures of the new testament quoth i.o who helps us in this though he hinder himself another way by it as to his canons constitution out of the first original copies pag
it doth not appear that the undefined span alphabet of the several writers of it were ever gathered into one volumne there being now no one church to keep them for the rest the epistles though immediately transcribed for the use of other churches col
mark how he quotes the very place too we are upon as if he owned pauls to laodicea which if he do he wounds himself to death in his that not a tittle or iota of the inspired scripture as given out at first is lost but remaining every apex of it in the copies now enjoy fith heres a whole epistle of pauls lacking as well as his first to corinth and ephesus in which were many tittles and lotaes were doubtless kept in the several churches to which they were directed from those undefined span alphabet there were quickly undefined span alphabet given out to faithful men whilst the infallible spirit continued his guidance in an extraordinary manner

here t.d said no more but was ad altum srlentium and at his non ultra as to opposing the being of such an epistle of paul to laodicea legitimate but rather fell under the weight of what evidence was brought to prove it so yet when after long striving against this antecedent which was urged in proof of this conclusion viz
that theres more holy scriptures extant to this day which are as much a rule as those ye have in your bibles and call your rule exclusively of all others to shew himself to be one of those i.o speaks of who are as like i.o too as ever they can look that are to english j.o's
latine

so unhappily stupid or that they will be indoctrinated by no reason nor experience but as if themselves aboue must all being puft up with a vain perswasion of their own faith they obstinately persist in the contempt of such things as they understand not and so with the comedian cry out let who will say what he will from this opinion we will not be removed t.d at last denyes the consequence saying pag
suppose we should grant you there were such an epistle legitimate yet it will not follow that it was intended for a rule to us

and why so may any rational reader say for this reason quoth t.d which reason is as silly as if he had said because it will not for we have already as much as god thought sufficient god did not give order for any more then them we have to be our rule what order he gave for any writing at all to be the rule or canon will be seen anon or whether man did not give order for the canonizing of that that is authorized as the rule but how appears it that god gave order for some holy scriptures and not some some holy mens writings some of pauls epistles and not othersome hereby quoth read iob

reason why pauls other epistles are authentick and canonical but that of his to laodicea though as legitimate as the rest must not be so lyes so close hid up that a man may sooner find the way of a bird in the air or of a serpent upon a rock or a fish in the sea then find it or any thing that hath the least iota of a reason of such a matter quis nist mentis inops who but a man besides his wits can see either sense or reason in this reason iohn sayes christ did more things then he wrote of in that book therefore pauls epistle to laodicea not so canonical as his other epistles but to take it as it comes consider first iohn speaks of that particular history that he was then in hand with secondly he speaks of signes and not of scriptures thirdly though he affirms that more were done by christ then were written in his book yet many might be and were written by matthew mark and luke that were not by him so that every way that scripture makes against t.d
for first if iohns writing that book were exclusive of any of pauls legitimate epistles it must be of them all and of all legitimate scripture that was wrote after this and so of his own three epistles and of his revelation also from the canon what mad work will t.d make that way and what a fowl flaw will

he make in his canon by medling to exclude one book of the new testament excluding well nigh all iohns book was sufficient therefore no more need be written this is the inference according to and not iohns was sufficient therefore pauls to laodicea only so illegitimate that it must have no room in the rule nor standing in the standard though all other his epistles now extant may


iohn speaking that all the signs christ did were not written is no argument to prove that all that was written by the spirit was not as equally useful as some of it and all alike designed and ordered to the same ends so that if some were intended for a rule the rest must be yea faith not the scripture thus rom

saith it not that no prophecy of scripture which with i.o is the scripture of the prophecy must be interpreted as private discourses that all holy men of god spake as moved of the holy spirit was not all then that was written before christ and since intended to one and the self same end though all that was done was not written understand not therefore the force of this argument of

all that was done was not written therefore much of that which was written is of no use or not intended to the same use to the church as the rest was


it perfectly confirms against what we assert against him viz
that pau's writing to laodicea and whatever else of holy mens writings that were undefined span alphabet and can be found have caeteris paribus one as much authority as the other being all alike legitimate for iohn sayes of what ere is written if t.d will stretch iohns saving beyond the bounds of that individual book he was then writing it was written all to the same end i.e
that men might believe which with you not us is as much as to say to be a rule of faith
one thing more must not let slip here though did in his account of the dispute viz
that when t.d had no more to say against that argument from paul epistle to the laodiceans one of his associated assistants wilkinson asked whether we had more scripture in the greek tongue now extant then is in their greek testaments for that to laodicea being here but englished it would not down with them
reply was made yea so naming a verse between the and verses of the chapter of luke which is in some greek copies not theirs and a verse of the original text wanting makes still against o.'s of the scripture of both testaments remaining in the copies they now have entire to a tittle as it first given out without any losse pag
repeated it in english thus out of the greek in which greek tongue have also read it iesus seeing a certain man working on the sabbath day said unto him man if thou knewest indeed what thou dost thou were happy but if thou knowest not thou art accursed and a transgressor of the law

and so have proved against that there's much scripture of holy men which was as much designed in its first giving out to be the rule as

which is in modern bibles wanting and lost some whereof yet is extant in some bibles at this day in which confutation of t.d i.o is further confuted as to all those many places of his book wherein he avers over and over again with exceeding earnestnesse his viz
that not one iot nor tittle of divinely inspired scripture is lost but every apex and letter of it as at first writing is transcribed downward to us and preserved without any losse in the copies we now have pag

and so this might stand for a final answer to i.o and both as to that matter of the non entirenesse or perfection of the letter which was given out upon inspiration of its integrals to this day and an answer to o's
confident positions and challenge concerning the uniformity of all bibles without variety in the least which to his own confutation here set down in his own words of which yet more use that way may be made hereafter

pag
neither the care of god over his truth nor the fidelity of the judaical church will permit us to entertain the least suspition that there was ever in the world any copy of the bible differing in the least from that which we enjoy or that those we have are corrupted as is pretended the authors of that insinuation cannot produce the least testimony to make it good
and pag
let the authors of this insinuation prove the assertion name'y that there was ever in the world any other copy of the bible differing in any one word from those we now enjoy let them produce one testimony one author of credit jew or christian that can or doth speak one word to this purpose let them direct us to any relick any monument and kind of remembrance of them and not put us off with weak conjectures and it shall be of weight with us and epist pag
we evidently find various lections the greek copies which we enjoy and so grant that which ocular inspection evinces to be true yet none of them are able to shew out of any copies yet extant in the world or that they can make appear ever to have been extant that ever there were any such various lections in the originals of the old testament
and so come to take my leave of t.d again for a while till meet him again as must do where he meets in one with i.o in many other places and return to walk on a while with about the inclosure and bounds of his synodically composed and humanely constituted and compleated canon which he takes it for granted by tradition before it be given him by the true that it was closed and bounded by divine authority

and as concerning this consignation signing sealing setting out or authorizing of the canon as to the measure of it or number of books so canonized the nature of which as a rule or canon is anon more spoken to say as above am yet to learn that lesson which who by road repeats it for truth as if he had it at his fingers never yet learn'd himself believe by root of heart nor can ever teach me that by divine authority or any otherwise then iure synodico by meer mens will wisdom and as they sate in councel together not standing in gods councel the light in the heart taking counsel but not of him nor at his mouth but each

from other and covered with a covering but not of his spirit it came at first to passe that some undefined span alphabet or holy mens writings by the spirit must passe for currant coin and stand as the standard and reign as a rule and command in the high authority of a canon as the word of god as truly as that very word that comes immediately from gods own mouth to holy or that word it self which the letter writes of and other undefined span alphabet or writings of holy men yea some of the self same men that wrote some of the rest and those as legitimate too according to d's hypothesis as the rest should be spurned out as spurious so far at least
that they must not inherit with their fellowes that conceited immortal inmutable and everlasting crown of that solemn canonization


am sure upon his principles must grant me thus far that if the bible of scripture which he confesses to be his canon lydius lapis and touchstone to try all by doth no where testifie any such thing within it self of it self that such books prophesies stories epistles letters psalms proverbs and other writings as are bound up in it are of gods and such as are not there bound though born testimony to there as of as divine original as the rest are not of gods own canonization then it must be counted that that precise consignation of the canon as consistent of such only and not of such books had its original being from some convocations or sessions of meer men that were neither prophets nor apostles but some that doted as doctors do now a dayes being none themselves on the prophets and apostles persons and such writings of theirs as best pleased them out of the scripture know not where can pore for proof of any thing who looks awry upon the light and spirit it came from saving into that thing which he so often calls his own thoughts all which with me are not worth as to the begetting of any infallible unfeigned faith and if he will alledge tis so that this thats in our bibles and copies only is the rule of gods own consignation and none of the rest mentioned there must come into it he is certain of it he thinks so to which tune he frequently sings in his second treatise or heap of uncertain assurances or most assured vncertainties about the points he may keep his think to himself if he will and never thrust that forth as an argument to evince any thing to us by its labour in vain for we verily believe that in the most things at least that he gives us his thoughts about he does think it to be as he sayes he thinks tis
but whats what he thinks to other men is there any reason that we believing our own eyes should beleeve the testimony of a man of no credit with us asserting that for truth which we know to be utterly false appeal to epist

but if he will say the scripture speaks any where of the bounding and consignation of its canon by so many or so few or by such and such books as are extant only in your bibles and no other would fain know where it mentions any such or the apostles in any of their synods or sessions had any hand in any such matter and if not iudge to be past such a child as to believe that what the synods of succeeding ages constituted authorized canonized or established was done purely per jus divinum or apostolicum either

as to the canon as ye call it or standard of the old testament there's not the least tittle of tendency to any such thing hinted there that it should consist of so many books and such shall stand in it and such other though as legitimate and mentioned to be of god therein as well as the rest shall be shut out and stand by and in very ezra alias esdras his dayes when there was such a paucity of copies as thou well sayest i.o pag
that in very deed the who'e law was burnt as to the originals its like at least esdras

the care of him and his companions was great as thou sayest as to the restoring of the scripture to its purity when it had met with the greatest tiyal that ever it before insomuch that what books could be gotten together were copied cut or else written de novo by the light of understanding kindled in esdras his heart by the lord and many excellent thing done as to the recovery of the law into more purity in the very letter of it out of the babilonish rubbish but whats all this as to the settling of this and that and t'other prophecy into the distinct measure of a standard by divine appointment and all others save such as are in your bibles called canonical whether those of the seers gad nathan iddo and the rest abovesaid that are specified in your bibles or those later which are allowed a room and standing in your bibles though not a room and standing in your rule and standard thereof called apocryphal of which some were esdras his own as well as some of the rest

besides tis evident that esdras and his companions if the consigration and bounding of the canon were in their dayes or by their sanydrim set a work and ordered by the insallible spirit of god therein wrote a number more of books esdras


then are now extant in your bibles which if all lost it makes against i.o still that sayes not an apex of what was by divine inspiration is lost and so his great engine out of which he shoots short against the truth his standard and canon comes still lame and short and halting home
and also though esdras and his company compiled

many yet the last volume of the psalmes is more credibly supposed if would enter into o's
work of answering conjecture with conjecture to be truss'd up together in the dayes of the maccabees but all here is uncertain and carried to and fro by conjectures and so there's nothing sure on o's side

and as to the newer and later scripture since christ where is the least touch of such a businesse of constituting some few certain books of those many more then we have which were then written into a canon and discarding othersome whether such as we want or such legitimate ones as we have as that to laodicea from within the coasts and quarters of your canon nay rather the scripture of the new sayes as in the places above cited rom

as many as walk according to this rule or canon do it which blind guides and people so hastily patter over as if that mentioned the whole bible and all that writing and not a tittle more then whats bound up in it besides the apocrypha when shall shew in its proper place its spoken of no external scripture of writing at all say will that prove some to be authorized of god for the standard and some even of the same holy mens writings though yet extant not to be so is there any such distinction in the sound of that term this rule whereby if it were meant of scripture as its nothing lesse to give us to discern that

paul in that expression includes his two epistles to corinth and that one to ephesus and this to galatia and the rest of his own and other apostles writings even the revelation it self that was not wrote in his dayes that are concincinated in your copies as intended of god to be the standard and excludes his first to corinth his first to ephesus and that to laodicea as not intended of god to stand in the standard but to stand below it to be tryed and judged by it

or by this rule did he mean no more then what was already written which of you wise men that render in your interpretations that term rule there of an outward letter can riddle me this if so as ye say then he quite cuts off what should be written after this either by himself for any other inspired writer and so all iohns epistles and his revelation rom coming into that right it hath to rule as the standard among the rest or if no then that place and indeed it doth not makes not at all to o's purpose who yet quotes it in proof of his canon as carelesly as others do for customs sake among a vast company of other texts that he crowds on a heap one a top of another not one of which proves the point he there propounds viz scripturam post completum ejus canonem esse regulam perfectissimam ita ut nullae revelationes sint admittendae that the scripture is so perfect a rule or canon that after the compleating of its canon which was not when paul wrote to galatia if iohns epistles and the revelation be a part of it mark that no more revelations must be admitted see ex

and now am upon that term of thine post completum ejus canonem let me take it while it is in my mind much muse what ye mean by this so often compleating and bounding of your canon and marvel what epoche iuncture and period of time this perfecting of your canon and standard as to all its integral parts must take its being and beginning as such and be counted from so that before that time it can't be called a perfect rule or standard if it be from that time which calls the close of the revelation of gods will pag

nor yet when paul wrote that gal

and so neither of those two places cited by both i.o or t.d do prove their as to its integrals and compleat already when paul and iohn wrote them and yet for all that can find by i.o and t.d both they not only count their canon compleat and perfect at the time of the writing of those two verses but likewise produce those very two verses viz i.o both and one of them viz joh
and expresly and in effect the other to prove their rule to be a most perfect rule and compleat canon already long afore the supposed close thereof in the revelation yea counting from the time of the penning of that place ioh

as much as god thought sufficient

as if that history of iohn had pin'd the basket and brought up the recto all the whole standard of outward scripture and compleated it as sufficiently as god thought fit it ever should be yea so sufficient as that all that should be written after should be held superfluous

no more then a most perfect rule it is now a compleat canon sufficient standard adaequate to all cases that come to be tryed by it inalterable touchstone immutable measure to measure all spirits by to which nothing may be added and confesse if the writing be the rule standard measure true word of god which its but a writing of it ought to remain from the first to the last ad amussim exactly the same as to its measure as well as to its nature and to have not one iot not an inch not a tittle added to it to make it larger longer or wider then at very first canonizing and authorizing into its office it ought to be steady and standing the same within it self as well in its quantity as quality as a substantive and not such an adjective as can't stand by it self without more and more and more words and writings still from time to time newly adjoyned to it to shew its sense and signification about those things its to measure determine and to be the all in all even both the rule and the iudge of as ye make it say it can be no more now its thus compleated as it is by successive additaments from moses himself to the revelation and not one jot lesse it was according to you conceited canonizers thereof before iohn or paul or any of the new ever wrote no lesse then a perfect standard that had its consignation and canonical bounding and its borders so set out that what came not to hand what appeared not at the session of that sanydrim that sate in ezraes dayes to try and iudge on and authorize what was fit to be the iudge and rule for themselves and all after ages to be tryed by must be condemned as apocryphal for ever and no lesse then so that little was that was in the dayes of isaiah before himself or any of the prophets him had written to the law to the testimony cry out from isa

yea no lesse then a canon that had its compleat consignation and bounding for all truth which was the same then as it is now to be tryed by when no more then moses five were extant so long before it was enlarged into such a volume as

now the bible is by adding to the old word were the letter that word of god thats the standing measure know not what to make of all these additions to the word if the letter be the word which have been made from moses downward to this day but matter of plagues woes and reproofs to the adders of their writings to the first writings but this can say to the excuse of such as call moses five only a compleat canon and in compleat authority as a standard and a rule and the word of god and such like full well may five or any one book of moses or any one chapter or one verse never so small in either his or any other prophets scripture be so when if weel believe when he lyes every tittle and iota of any of these outward writings is not only part of the word but the word of the great god as pag
yea every apex of it equally divine and as immediately from god as the voice wherewith or whereby he spake to or in the prophets and is therefore accompanied with the same authority i.e as the whole is both in it self and unto us pag
so then every tittle is no lesse then a compleatly constituted canon and the whole is no more then so

and further as to the new testament as ye call the letter of it as there is not the least evidence that any such thing as the specifying of what and whose scriptures or writings the canon should consist of and what not so can any of you that stand up so stifly for your fancied stable standard shew us where any order is given out by christ or his apostles to such as should succeed them to take care to gather up their writings and judge and try which of them they thought fit and which not to own as their rule and iudge and accordingly digrading the rest to canonize such as liked them best to submit themselves to the tryal and iurisdiction of into the high names and authority of the word of god the iudge the rule the standing canon both to them and all the world and all after ages of it to the worlds end doth tim

the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also and in the other place these but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived and so they do at this day for all their scufling for the scripture but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them
whence it is by many that would look upon themselves as wronged if not looked upon as learned as hastily concluded as the places are handover head alledged
that paul bids timothy take the scripture first committed to him by himself and commit it downwards to faithful men that must commit and continue it downwards still to others and so successively to the worlds end as a common continual permanent perpetually remaining canon and

only standard for all nations and spirits
gods and mans and doctrines true and false to stand or fall by from thenceforth even for ever

which what a crooked consequence it is who but ignoramus can be ignorant whenas if the scripture had been the subject spoken of there by paul either it had extended no further then to his own scripture to timothy which is but a petty portion and poor pittance of pauls epistles or if to all the rest of his epistles then it had been conclusive of that to laodicea and his first to corinth and ephesus which have no being in your bibles which you say contains all your canon and are by excluded from any claim to it but in very deed theres no such thing at all as the scripture or outward text there either talkt on or intended but the things timothy had learn't and heard from paul by word of mouth as well as writing which though own to be truths and doctrines and things which are evermore according to the scripture the spirit from which that was never contradicting it self yet were another thing then the undefined span alphabet that is the writing or scripture it self paul sayes not those scriptures which thou hadst of me commit to faithful men to make a standard of but those doctrines truths which thou hast heard of me commit and those truths were concerning the light which paul was sent to turn men to and not the letter for he sayes god made him and the rest ministers not of the letter but of the spirit act

neither did paul go up and down testifying to the scriptures as a standard and telling men which should be the touchstone and which scriptures not but the things which were witnessed to there testifying no other things quod essentiam to be believed or done then what were written in and spoken by the law and the prophets acts



and those things timothy heard learned and was assured of from pauls both words and writings as also the things the thessalonians thess

had delivered to them partly by pauls preachings and partly by his epistles and were accordingly to stand fast and continue in but they were not the bare bible it self or writings or scriptures themselves which were not then by paul or any bundled up and carried about in a book to take a text and talk out of for money as ministers do now adayes
and if insist upon the next words viz tim

which place mentions the holy scriptures and is mentioned know not how many times over in o's
book in proof of that which it in no wise evinces and must be more plainly spoken to by me in due place

rep confess that next verse doth mention the scriptures but more against then to o's purpose and more disproves then proves what he draws from the other yea it assures us that it was not the scriptures in any wise meant in the
verse for paul saith to timothy that from a child he had known the holy scriptures i.e of the old testament for those of the new were not as yet canonized nor all written if any of them were at all written in timothies nonage but the things he had heard and learned of paul and was bid to continue in and commit to other faithful men to teach were such as he had come into the knowledge and assurance of after he was

taken by paul acts to travel with him which was not till he was grown past a child if that expression knowing of whom thou hast learned vers

and from a child

so that neither of these two texts teach any such matter as any of the outward text of the new testament scriptures being either canonized by the apostles in their dayes or ordered by them to be stated as a standard in the councels of succeeding ages and whatever men did de facto that way in the second or third centuries the antiquity whereof as venerable as it is to some and antiquaries is with us but novelty and superstition if it appear not to descend de iure from the first yet we quary still quo iure by what authority from god christ or the apostles the synods and men that so authorized and canonized what scriptures seemed to them as challenging

so high a title and office as the word of god rule foundation canon standard and such like secluding other writings as holy as these were authorized or commanded so to do themselves

as thinks at least all were because some were were doubtlesse kept in the several churches whereto they were directed which confession if true as sure enough it is clears it that the original copies were never viewed together in one bulk by any councel or synod whereby to put it into a capacity to iudge and determine of their fitnesse to make a canon of but only mens copies of the original which but that every man will think his think and i.o think as well as may be of it

yet who can assuredly insallibly uncontroleably tell as sometimes though sometimes again he will seem but to think so undertakes to do in his grand assertion that they answer the first original in every tittle and iota say confessing all this how weakly doth i.o assert with confidence his thoughts in this as a point of faith pag

at first entrance to treat on its fixednesse thou wast either witting or willing enough to do which rule or letter as much as it hath been and is capable to be wrested is not by far at such uncertainty in it self as ye that profess to be ruled by it and stand upon it as your basis are at endlesse odds and infinite uncertainty in your conjectures and guesses about it insomuch that it grieves me not a little for your sakes to see your souls so sunk over head and ears in confusion and confused noises about it in which the sweet still voice and silent whisperings of the spirit of christ within can have no audience in that crowd of pro and cons that ye are cumbred with about your very foundation which ye have not found yet so as to this day to abide fixt and firm or to be quiet concerning it in any academies upon earth but in vain ianglings in all corners thereof from one end of christendom to another yea professe in the sight of god that in such grief and bowels write about it that this page and passage passes not from under my pen without being watered with many tears for your sakes whom see perishing by your own iuglings unlesse happily ye will yet be pull'd as brands out of the fire and in no wise think i.o that am so angry at your folly which the deceit may suggest unto you as offended at the enmity it self that flyes up within you and befools you

and seeing that thou i.o seemeth to beg wish and hope for such a thing crying out undefined span alphabet in case of novelty of points and variety of lections as nor seeing any means of being delivered from utter uncertainty in and about all sacred truth that those who have more wisdom and learning and are able to look throw all the digladiations that are like to ensue on these principles would nather take the pains to instruct and such as thou art then be angry or offended with you that ye are not so wise or learned as themselves and desiring such as are shaken in mind to read the useful miscellany notes of as thou callst him the learned mr pocock
reply
not as one angry or offended that ye are not so wise or learned as my self
nor


as one pretending to much of that ye call wisdom and learning which lyes more in outward tongues arts or sciences falsly so called then in that of the spirit for want of which peter calls men never so wise and well learned otherwise both unlearned and unstable and for all their buste buslings about it not openers but wresters of the scripture to their own ruine which shelly shallow theory into things of that nature perhaps have forgotten more of for the naked gospels sake then many of our preachers of the gospel for pay ever learned and yet have enough left whereby to discern many country teachers or doctors to be dunces in it yet what ever my measure is more or lesse further then as an earthly talent foolish instrument or wooden tool for a long time laid aside and here taken up again to serve the truth with against those that fight therewith against truth its utterly lost and become dung and losse it self to me for the excellency of the knowledge of christ my lord that spirit in the spirit and truth in the inward parts and of that aforesaid thin foamy speculation acknowledge that many of you have not only much more then my long since countrified self but much more also then either does good or does you good

unlesse ye had more of the true wisdom from above whereby to use it to a better end then ye do

yet
as one who have obtained so much mercy and ability fro god to see throw all the digladations that are likely to ensue on the principles that are now in agitation among your selves as wel as between the quakers and your selves herein take so much pains as is worth so much patience as ye men of war are like to have with me for so doing and tell you in the name and dread of the living god whether ye bear or forbear that the shakings of mind that are among the learned lievtenants of antichrist at their gates of hell as honest iohn hus and learned luthur stiled the vniversities about their own literal and fallible foundation will assuredly end in the final fall of it as a foundation and all the digladiations of those swattering who pretend to be fighting with the sword of the spirit about their supposed sword of the spirit i.e the bare outward letter which they mistake for the word of god when in reality they are at it with but the scabbard about the scabbard will end in no lesse then the very sheathing of the true sword of the spirit in the bowels of the babel builders that are so blindly busie about it in their divided speeches confounded languages and in the bringing down the babel which ye all agree to build upon it

whereby to the light and truth it self the letter talks on the fall and coming down of which tripple tower of the tripple tribe of levi the clergy or lot as they call themselves of the lords own inheritance hath already raised from their thrones all the kings of the nations and moved hell from beneath to meet them isa
and what work more will attend this great catastrophe of that chaos even the old heaven and earth the worldly rudiments of which begin to melt and the frail foundations thereof to shake that they may remove and the new come in place that must remain will as the lord lives make the eares to tingle in a little time to come that now refuse to hear of it from the tongues and pens of the lords prophets to whom it is revealed and their minds amazed and their hearts shake and shiver that harden themselves against the troublesome testimony of it

wherefore if thou art in earnest in thy enquiry tell thee i.o by way of answer to thy undefined span alphabet that if not only thy rich possession as thou stilest it of the hebrew punctation and that or unity and indentity of lection in thy copies but also all the copies of the original that are in the world and translations too come utterly to moulder perish and passe away as the originals themselves have long since done yet truth is the

same that it was before any letter or outward text of it was both quoid essentiam and quoad explicationem also in the hearts and consciences of all men in a measure and in such a measure in the minds of such as love it and walk in what of it is therein by the light and spirit of god made manifest that there's no such need to them as there is to thy self and others who yet hatest the light of such piteous as thou makest upon the hypothesis aforesaid nor of such direful affrightments and amazements as over take and thee and all the hypocrites and sinners in whose manition it self is now nothing but magor misabib fear round about while theirs who walk up ightly by the light and live by which leads into the substance of the lite it self the letter calls for is the manition of rocks and salvation it self which god appoints to them for walls and bwarks yea these dwell with that devouring fire and everlasting burnings which are now kindled by the worlds wickednesse and burning down to hell to the consuming the very foundations of the earth and with god himself who is a consuming to the stubble and and bryars and thorns that are now set against him to battel and their daily bread is given them and their waters shall be sure so that they shall not need with the wicked whose trust is in man upon whom the curse of the heat cometh who inhabit the parched places of the wildernesse and must not know when the good cometh nor taste of the streams that flow in the desert nor of the brooks nor of the floods of honey and butter to send such hot and hasty hae and cryes as thou dost after a long since lost letter to live upon to see if any can tell tydings of every tittle apex and iota thereof or else all life of truth is lost for ever if all these dead things be not found restored recouered and revived to that life they never had and rendezvouz'd again out of the romish rubbish what shall such as follow the lamb wheresoever he goes and have come throw great tribulation with him and washed their white in his blood and been thereby redeemed from the earth and tongues and kind eds thereof and stand with him on mount sion and hear his voice as his sheep did of old become such babes and idiots again as to think with thee and thy fellow thinkers that all truth lost if one tittle of the text of your transcripts have been st by fallible scribes in their transcribings of it and to wander over the world from library to library author to author so their thoughts from academy to academy with you universally university wonderers after and boyes toyes and and tags and pins and points and tittles and iotaes and such rich possessions infinite inheritances guilded primer promises psalters and old testaments and bibles and books which they could read as perfectly as your selves long since as to the literal sense thereof which ye labour so about that ye have no leasure to learn and look into the mastery of the holy matter it self and many more such gay trimmings and trappings wherewith like children that think themselves fine when they are bestangled and hung with points our academian adorers of the dead corps of their conceited to a tittle entirely true and exactly corrected copies deem themselves above all men to be adorned shall we because thou seest none see no means of being delivered from utter uncertainty in and about all sacred truth it self if the text wherein its but be translated totally away or but or mistranslated in some tittles or but taken away from the points that men at several periods have put to it

what silly suppositions are these to you supposed seers or deemed true teachers for shall we think our learned divines do not certainly divine the truth say the young students and stupid starers upon the and stones they take councel at who when all is done are but meer des and supposers and such as can treat out no more but your thoughts about either that sacred antiquity of your present punctation
or your so absolutely asserted integrity and identity of your naked literal text without any corruption of it by any or variety of lections in undefined span alphabet pag

yea verily whether we consider either one or t'other of these two bottoms that thou thinkest all sacred truth and certainty of it is so founded upon that if they fail all falls remedilesly for ever
thou makest no provision for so much as the probable proof of these but leavest them both notwithstanding al thy seruple about them on the certainty of which thou makest all truth everlastingly to depend as uncertain at least as they were without thy talk for them or if there be any alteration at all in the case of their uncertainty thou hast by thy hosty bandling of that matter made it more certain and out of doubt to me then it was before that the points are novel and not coaevous with the consonants and that the letter is abundantly altered and corrupted in the very copies of the original text itself
take but a review i.o of some few of thy thoughts upon these two matters and thou wilt discern if thou be not blinded that all the world may see thy overlashing positions viz
that the points are coaevous with the first manuscripts and that the text remains intirely the same in your transcripts as at first giving out without any losse alteration or corruption to a tittle are supported with no more then solely thy suppositions

chap
iv
first for the punctation what positively thou affirmest of it in a note above ela is to be seen in thy epist
pag


and in thy book pag




and throwout the whole four and five chapters of thy second treatise at present wee'l see how piteously thou underproppest thy opinion about it with the putting in of thy meer imaginations to other mens and not to say imposing but opposing thy suppositions taken from the meer suppositions of such learned authors as thou sidest with against the more solidly grounded suppositions of such as were are and are confessed by thy self to be learned as well as they and how thou confessest thou answerst one conjecture no otherwise then with another and standst thrusting with thy weak wonted weapon of shall we think pag
against others strong arguments to the contrary

first it is urged and that with no little shew of truth that the old hebrew letters being those the samaritan pentateuch is written with at this

day and that the samaritan letters having alwayes been and still being without points it must follow that the points are an invention and innovation of a later date then the change of the letters which was not till ezraes dayes and not goaeuous with the first scripture pag
in which the consequence being undeniable thou makest bold to think the antecedent may be false and among a deal more of doubtful stuffe to say that tis most uncertain when and in what character the samaritans received the pentateuch
that the letters thereof were the antient hebrew letters as for what eusebius hierom and some of the rabbins report it seems to thee on the best enquiry thou art able to make a groundlesse tradition and meer sable because though eusebius affirmed it was so affirmed yet tells not on what ground and though hierom himself be positive in it yet he might be mistaken in this as well as he was in some other things like to it as pag
he saw not all things and that the talmud is of no weight with thee

reply
what pedling disproof is here of i.o pushing against two antient fathers positions and the testimony of the whole talmud of the rabbins with no more then the of his own suppositions and slender sayings it's of no weight with me it seems to me a tradition pag
and it doth not appear to me whence this change of character should arise the jewes are thought and said in the captivity to have forgot their own character and learn'd the caldean so as to adhere to it in their return but that the men of one age should forget the use of their own letters is incredible
yet say more then credible yea certain it is that though the antients alive at the burning of the first and building of the second temple did not likely forget their own yet in and after the captivity the chaldean character was used witnesse the books of daniel ezra nehemiah ester in which much is written in chaldee say then what straw and stubble and unsteady stuffe is all this which our doctoral students in divinity stand so upon as to stiffen themselves by it against each other in their sturdy disputes about their stupidities yet so far are solid saints from putting any stresse much more so much as i.o who states and trusts no lesse then whole sacred truth thereon upon such ticklish pinnacles and points or from strengthning themselves in their faith towards god thereby that its even a stink to them to see any so senslesse as so to do on either hand pag


the argument for the novelty of the points from the antient iudaical coines found with samaritan characters upon them is refel'd with the rush of thy own ridiculous and reasonlesse fancies which sith they are too frivolous to rehearse refer the reader that is minded to be so foolish as to follow thee in that high road as thy self there callst it and so savest me the labour of sprinkling it into that name of forgeries and fables in which thy self as well as those thy opponents are altogether to pag
where he may read thee rendring of simple supposition against supposition or rather against position disproving ignotum per magis ignotum dubium per magis dubium pelting back out of thy such brown paper as this at the probable arguments of others viz
may we not think
it is not improbable that it was so old nor is it improbable

that twas so
cannot think the greeks of old used only the vncial letters which yet we know some did
shall crave leave to answer this conjecture with another and grant that such a change was made yet this prejudices not them in the least who affirm ezra and the men of the great congregation to have been the authors of the points nay it casts a probability on the other hand namely that ezra laying aside the old letters because of their difficulty together with the other introduced the points to facilitate their use

and lastly to bring up the reerward of thy manifold fictions foisted out against the urgings of that probable proof from the characters upon the coines after thou hadst prosecuted them a while passim testaque lutoque thou concludest thus viz
now let any man iudge from this heap of vncertainties of which say i.o's
there accumulated are know not how many to one of the other any thing can arise with the face of a witnesse to be admitted to give testimony on either hand say much lesse on i.o's
whose own heap of confessed uncertain conjectures is manifold more massy then that of his antagonists yea as weighty as the very wind it self
he that will part with his possession on such easie terms quoth i.o there never found much benefit by it
and say he that will part with much labour and pains to find out the antiquity of this possession of hebrew letters points and tittles and think to get much benefit by purchasing it to himself therewith as and ancient an inheritance as pretends it is pag

and as many millions as he sayes pag
look'd on and enjoyed it for many ages as their chiefest treasure pag
he shall assuredly have his labour for his pains

and if may crave leave to interpose so far as to answer i.o's
many uncertain ones with one more certain conjecture tell that he hath himself conjectured away the very thing he conjectured for and tost his own cause so long to and fro among the multitude of his uncertain thoughts conjectures and suppositions till unawares to himself in the crowd thereof he hath lost it altogether and supposed it into the very bosom of his opponents for if ezra and his congregation were the authors of the points and introduced them as he sayes the argument from the characters on the coines renders it probable that they did pag as is abovesaid then proculdubio for certain and of a truth it may both be conjectured and must be credibly and infallibly believed that they are so far from being coaevous with the first manuscripts that they were invented and introduced though before the tiberian massorites yet after all that he owns as the canonical scripture of the old testament was first written and so he gives it in for granted that they are a novelty and not a thing that was from the beginning of the scripture which is that he is to prove or else it comes short of his purpose so as to adde an inch to his arch assertion of a non alteration of the text as at first given out in any tittle and so as if he had not in pag to the contradicting of his own meer conjecture and conceit of their coaevousnesse with the immediate manuscripts said thus no wayes doubt but as we now enjoy the points we shall manifest that

they were compleated by ezra and his companions and so confounded himself enough he hath by this reiteration of the same
conjecture about the points overthrown himself as to that point altogether the first writing of the pentateuch being by his own confession pag
a thousand years elder then ezra and according to himself all the rest both written and lost before ezra the scribe and his fellows dayes who he makes but the transcribers and restorers of them so pag
out of azarias he ascribes the figure and character of the points to ezra and the restoration of their use to the massorites whether then the points be from ezra or the tiberian massorites is much at one to the root and bottom of thy businesse which is to evince that the text stands entirely the same in your pointed copies to a tittle without variation from what it was when first written and that the points are coaevou with the scripture it self and thou talkst that according to the general belief of the jewes they are if not from moses yet at least from ezra not denying the use and knowledge of them received a great reviving by the massorites when they had been much disused pag
from which massorites yet for ought thou clearly or any more but conjecturally and very uncertainly makst appear to the contrary they might as well receive their first being according to the testimony of elias levita who as thy self sayest pag
was the most learned grammarian of the iewes in his age and assistant to paulus fagius in his noble promotion of the hebrew tongue and the testimonies of luther the renownedst reformer in his time as ever europe had and of zainglius and others then that imbraced his opinion and of capellus whom thou stilest a learned protestant divine and of that learned professor dr iohn prideaux in his publick lecture at the vespers of your own oxonian counitia on that subject which dr i.p its no disparagement to dr i.o to confesse to have been in his time far before himself as to schoole divinity though we know that stands preferred a little before in the pag of thy epist

and to capellus his argument that twas likely
elias spake on principles of conviction of truth because against the common interest of all his people which seems to have weight in it how pedlingly thou replyest and pelletest out thy putations to the contrary pag
a very boy may behold the most material of which is this viz
that the testimony of this one elias should be able to the constant attestation of all the learned jewes to the contrary as capellus pleads and as is insinuated in that prolegomena is fond to imagine to which say why so elias thou confessest to assert what he did in such honestly as not in way of sleighting the points nor the scripture any more then if they had been the work of ezra from whose dayes and no higher thou derivest their pedigree but sith thou canst not do it from moses thy antiquity is but novelty with us so why may not the testimony of one learned and honest elias now the testimony of many iewes now whose general testimony thou sleightest and them too as wicked when they speak against thee as well as the testimony of one elias of old that of of the prophets of boal and the groves king

thirdly and as to the argument from the iewes keeping a copy without points which they adore in their synagogues thereby little lesse then implying the points to be of man and not of divine original which argument is of weight for if the letters were the word and the points with them a part of as divine original as the rest they durst not diminish ought much lesse so great a part as the points knowing the curse denounced in it against all detracters from it deut
this thou resellest as falsly and as the rest saying pag


its the constant opinion and perswasion of them all elias only excepted that they are of divine extract
reply
which if it were as certain to thee as it but seems so on the conjectures of such as thou sidest and consultest with yet elias ur prius might be right and they all wrong being all under the curse as well as some so that their testimony about scripture though they have it among them is no more to be heeded with thee where it makes against thee and why it should be more when it makes for thee a reasonable man can't see then aesops fables as to the use of the whole talmud of the robbins in christian religion pag


to let passe the rest as pedling thou tellest that and the reason why the jewes who have for ought find more books without then with points have their canon and standard without them is as they alledge the difficulty of transcribing copies without any failing the least rendring the whole book as to its use in their synagogues prophane
reply
to which say if it be so difficult then how darest thou date so deeply as thou dost on the unquestionablenesse of the transcripts of the bible with points being as entire to a tittle as the first this is ad hominem enough to confute thy own vain confidences about the of the text throw all ages to this day
and again because the least failing renders their standard prophane therefore they'l make their standard of such a copie as shall fail altogether as to the points as divinely essential a part with them secundum te as the very consonants themselves credat appella he that believes not that conjecture about the scripture shall never come into condemnation as i.o talks some shall for not owning the whole letter and its tittles as the word of god for his damnable unbelief dare assure him

that the jewes end seems to be this in not pointing their standing copies viz
that none be admitted to read or sing the law in their synagogues until he be so perfect in it as to be able to observe all points and accents in a book where there are none of them
reply
which is another whimzy of thy own brain for have often seen and heard their service read and sung in their synagogues by young boyes as the mouth of the whole body of or years of age or little more however at utter incapacity to observe all points so exactly as thou speakst of where there are none

and to the rest of thy answers throw that whole chapter to the other arguments against the coavousnesse or connaturalnesse of the points from elias his testimony the talmuds silence about the points the keri and ketib

from the number of points and vowels beyond that of differences of the sounds assigned to them the antients silence about their vse among the hebrews which are cogent enough to any but such as thy self who buildst all sacred truth upon the uncertain bottom of these apices and points and thereupon are foolishly afraid that all the word of god must go out of the world if thy fancies about them be not owned

they are made up of such a dirty deal of tittle tattle and frivolous fabulosity that as very a fool as have become for thy sake the truths to medle so much with these immaterialities and rake so far as have done into this pudle of thy pedantick prate for thy so points yet as thou
shall forbear having better accounts to give of my time and hours then to be mad in that manner and shall insanire cum ratione and though have turned my self a while with thee to behold and take a view of some of thy madnesse and folly yet shall wade no farther after thee into any more particular consideration of thy many vanities in that chapter but after a while return to things of more worth among wise men telling thee this for truth that the dark and dismal dreamings of thy selfdevised dangers hanging over the head of all sacred truth to the making havock thereof which have entered and centered themselves in thy imaginatory mind and of that mischief which thou conceivest will accrue to your carnal clerical and earthly interests honours profits and preferments in case the scripture and its transcripts and tittles which is the commodity ye mainly trade in be not kept up in that account it hath been in in times of ignorance and thereby poor people kept still in dependance on your vniversity doctorships under blind conceits that they cannot learn the mind of god but by your expositions pag
and that great uncertainty which thou not seeing yet thy self but jeering as doctorem infallibilem the only true infallible doctor or teacher the light and spirit of god within seest and confessest pag
ye shall be left unto in all your translations and expositions of the scripture without the owning of these points to be of divine original and thy knowing that ye must to the shame of your selves and the shaking of your kingdom in the very foundation thereof confesse and grant as ye are loath to do which yet is no more then the truth viz
that if the points be but novel your professedly uncorrupt copies are not a little corrupted and different from what the first originals were throw the failings of transcribers and so failing in your falsly so called foundation must be forced to begin again and lay the true one with the quakers which is that of christ himself the light which rather then do since you have so much persecuted and disowned them ye will rake your brains to the bottom to find something to say against the truth which is so tedious this is the grand cause and whole profound mystery of this businesse of thy busie busling and brawling so much for the necessity of the points being owned as of so high an original which else theres no necessity at all of owning either

at all as of such importance as thou pleadest or any otherwise then as the meer of man

having therefore given this taste of the fallibility of thy flashy shallow shufflings off what is more warrantably and weightily urged against the pretended antiquity of the hebrew punctation as coavous with the scripture and connatural with that language shall here glean up some other scambling sayings of thine about the points from several quarters of thy book worth heeding upon no other account then the crudity absurdity and ridiculousnesse of them and make some miscellany replies to and notes upon them that may rid my hands as fast as can of that rusty stuffe and mouldy matter now am upon it wholly and not have occasion to handle it much more in other places
thou sayest pag
that it is not thy design to give in arguments for the divine original of the present hebrew punctation neither dost thou judge it necessary so to do while buxtorf about that lyes unanswered

reply
then say thou hast hung thy reader up in the air and there left him among gapes and stares for pag
thou pretendest to plead and undertake to vindicate the letter to be as twas given out and handed to us without alteration which put me into an expectation of something of that nature but parturiunt montes
a runs out of a great mountain of talk for many pages together to prove the wickednesse of the massorites on whom the points are fathered which is all of it as thou confessest of some part of it nothing at all to thy purpose pag
but neither one tittle of so much as a topical argument to clear the businesse nor a nomination of one out of buxtorf but nil dat quod in se non babet hadst thou had any to produce it had been more useful then all thy babling to evidence the inalterablnesse of the bible which was thy businesse to prove and is so necessary that none but fools will by thy floud of words be into thy faith without such arguments to evince the truth on't in that point which thou are never able to urge in proof of it howbeit two considerations thou addest at the end of that chapter of thy second treatise wherein thou treatest of this point of the hebrew points as of weight to thee to add weight to all that light matter that went before propounded in such an indigested mangled hampered tediously tangled manner that he must be wiser then that can well tell what to make of them or find in them so much as top or bottom or plain premises or clear consequence or any kind of conclusion at all save that they are the conclusion of that chapter so that though there's a talk in them of grammar and rules of art and the world of points not coming together by chance and of the chaldee peraphrast and many more matters yet they seem to me to be a couple of confused chaosses that came to passe more by chance then by any rules of art and a world created by a casual concurrence of antick attomes more then any wisdom of either god or man consisting of the circumference of no lesse then pages together shall therefore rather then puzzle my self in prying

too much into such an orderlesse boundlesse piece of prate as that is keep what know of it within my own bowels and not send out an answer to know not what and to that which ends know not where and runs know not whither taking the councel of the poet who said ne immittas pecus tuum in pratum ubi non est sepes

thou sayest epist pag
that thou darest not mention the desperate consequences of that opinion concerning the novelty of the hebrew punctation being affrighted among other things by a little treatise lately sent thee wherein the author he is from some principles of this nature and unwary expressions of some learned men among you labours to eject and cast out as use'esse the who scripture or word of god
reply
which scripture say had it never been nor were it more to be as it must moulder once though as told thee above am free it should stand its time for such service as to cast out such men as useless that have cast off the light and spirit yet is the word of god as useful still as twas before and ever will be being that by which all is upheld for ever when the scripture that yet testifies of it shall moulder and come to nought as thy scribling scripture that testifies to that more holy scripture shall do and as for thy frights cannot blame thee for crying out undefined span alphabet when thou seest thy foundation sink and fail and crack under thee which is but a fallible letter a sandy seat a brittle bottom but such as stand on the rock of ages which the scripture witnesses to will stand in the approaching storms wherein thou and all thine will fall mat
and some see the end of that thou knowest not the mystery of
that had that leprosie or opinion about corruption of scripture undermining the authority of the hebrew verity kept it self within that house i.e the synagogue of rome which is throwly infected it had been of lesse importance it is but a farther preparation of it for the fire but it is now by the subtilty of satan crept in and broke forth amongst protestants also with what design to what end and purpose thou knowest not undefined span alphabet and the day will declare it epist pag

reply
yea and does declare it to many already though ye that are of the night and darknesse where nothing but errour and terrour is see no truth and are afraid of your own shadows and in the guilt of your guilful gailed consciences and benighted minds fear what it will grow to and what mischiefs and inconveniencies will ensue on searching too critically too neer into your own rule of scripture but though ye as thou dost epist pag
the knowledge of the tongues and the use of that knowledge in critical observations and that study and as unexpressibly advantagious and helpful in explanations of sundry difficulties yet feeling your own and your fellows mind measuring others each by himself to be exceedingly curious uncertain after a door of reputation and renown is once opened as ready quickly to spread over all bounds and limits of sobriety ye are afrighted to think what will now come on it to have

learned men exercise their critical abilities about the scripture for fear they find your foundation faulty and fallible and full of flawes and so had rather believe it to be sound at a venture seeing ye know no better to stand on then to have it sounded and found to be so unsound as it is epist pag

that it is not imaginable what prejudice the sacred truth of the scripture
reply
the truth told in it tell thee is the same for ever and can't be changed let the scripture become what it will and suffer the losse of its whole self
preserved by the infinite care and love of god hath suffered already hereby
reply
and as if not enough thou teachest criticks and tellest wayes to make others criticks that never meant it whereby instead of thy helping hand such is thy wisdom in the handling thy own businesse like an ill bird that bewrayes his own nest to recover it its likely to suffer more
what it may further suffer for thy part thou canst not but tremble to think
reply
yet to be sure it suffers nere the lesse but rather much more for thee and though thou art not more afraid then hurt yet some are not afraid nor hurt who dwell higher then thou dost whose place is the munition of rocks who see the end of that which seems a terrible gulf and praecipice to thee viz
that when theeves fall out true men will come by their goode and all things by their proper names and nature
thou sayest epist

that thou ca not but tremble to think what would be the issue of such a supposition that the points vowels and accents are no better guides to us then may be expected from those who are pretended to be their authors pag
reply
therefore the best way is to suppose nothing at all about them it matters not much whence they come there they now are and thy carking will not prove them to be of these men or those novel or antient and then all thy often tremblings about that toy will be taken away neverthelesse whether thou leave or cleave to them its much at one to thee tremble thou must at the true word of god when all is done first or last what ere becomes of the scripture of it

that lay but these two principles together namely that the points are a late invention of the jewish rabbins on which account it confest theres no reason we should be bound to them and that its lawful to gather

various lections by the help of translations thou must needs cry out undefined span alphabet where shall stand as not seeing any means of being delivered from utter uncertainty in and about all sacred truth pag

reply as if the light and spirit were lost and all certainty lost if the letter be and all o's

the light spirit word it self and the kingdom and things thereof which cannot be shaken but must remain when the worldly kingdom of worldly priests and their foundation and their rich possession of letter and hebrew points and all their religion faith worship house bottom and whole building and fabrick that stands thereon and the old heaven and earth and all the works of man that are therein and their writings and tomes and talmuds ut alibi and such like in which is exercised in his second tale of a tub and sea and land and all nations formalists and their forms professors and their professions doctors in divinity and their false dreames and divinations and not only popes cardinals monks friars iesuites and all that rabble of rabbies and deans and chapters deacons deans and their officials parsons vicars curats and all manner of spiritual persons of that spawn but also all sorts of those narrow mouth'd bottles

the consequences that unavoidably attend the receiving of truth are dangerous to thee but of no other then good concernment to such as dwell not in the scriptural skirts meer literal suburbs of it as thou dost who being without the salvation it self which god appoints to his for walls and bulwarks startest at the newes of every storm and the shaking of every leaf but in the holy city and in the substance of the truth it self the cup of trembling must be taken out of their hands and put into the hands of thee and thine that have hated and afflicted them and rid over them and said bow down thy back that we may go over and they have laid their backs as the street for you while in your wrath and fury you have passed over them

thou sayest pag
that thou canst not but tremble to think what would be the issue of this supposition that the points vowels and accents are no better guides unto you then may be expected from those who are to be their authors
reply
ye had not been quakers but against trembling and quaking because ye jeer at it so in the quakers who professe and pretend to trembling at nothing but at the word of god it self but see ye are trembling at smaller matters out of the sense of the losse of toyes and trifles now the day of iacobs trouble trembling begins to passe over and he to be saved out of it trembling it seems begins to take hold on the house of esau who must assuredly come into it in his stead and that with a witnesse and to some purpose when they who yet stop the ear shall hear the word of god who is the strength and salvation of his people roaring out of zion and as a lyon uttering his voice from to the shaking of the heavens and the earth and not be able to flee out of the reach or sound of the terrible roaring thereof

do you expect such eminent guidance as ye here seem to do from these pidling pricks and points into the kingdom of god and salvation so that the terrours of hell take hold on you at the very time and thought of the losse of no more then that meer imagined antiquity and pretended divine original of them from mount sinai that some fillily ascribe unto them suppose ye could prove them to be derived from mount sinai which is that where there were quakings and tremblings blackness and darkness and tempest will they lead guide and conduct you from condemnation to the safety rest refreshment and consolations of them that are come to dwell on mount sion ah miserably men and benighted ministers it grieves me to see how poor people wait upon you for guidance who are groaping up and down for the wall your selves like such as have no eyes after such small apices and scintillula's indiscernable and incomprehensible attomes as these which are of such infinite variety vanity and uncertainty that tis as profitable capere muscas to catch flyes and sit and peel strawes as to spend time to find out either their authors or differences or services or vses
for so verily are the hebrew accents as uselesse as numberlesse in their offices insomuch that the learned christian ravis of berlin professor of the oriental languages doth in his grammar not only utterly deny them as others do to be with the consonants or to be written by moses but also not to be so ill handled by the authors who ere they were as to cast so many unnecessary idle unreasonable superfluous useless fancies upon them as our doters on them do now a dayes
confesse quoth he we cannot set down the time place method authors crooked knots punctually which were never set down but tis as old to have bibles without points as with them

they are not the same in hebrew samaritan chaldee syriack aethiopick

the graecians at first were content with a for vowels
persians turks tartars mogul great and little and malay could be content to this day without pricks instead of vowels
what think you then quoth he was there a curse of god upon the jewes and all the prophets that they nor could nor would understand the writings one of another without so many superfluities and what a malediction will you cast quoth he upon gods word that when many hundreds can understand and that without any haesitation at all thousands of other books without these they should not be able to understand gods book without such ado if that infinity of pricking and stroking every line and letter were in the bible were it not the greatest injury that could be done to it to have it once printed without them how would the jewes dare to offer such sacriledge so vnexpressible must the jewes find out an easier way then god himself to leave out pricks what an absurdity is in all the accents not one excepted athnack stands in an hundred places as a boy or servant truly pitty quoth he all those great men that are become boyes and children playing thus for the vowels accents and diacritical notes that they write whole books about fancies and given over to reprobate minds and without the of god
the pricks added to the consonants are various according to the fancies of the inventors in various countries of the orient in hebrew chaldee arabick and aethiopick are there naturally none because superfluous
the strokes and pricks are not of the essence of this tongue therefore only in the bible and are set to the bible without necessity
only wish'd that the vowels and sheva's quoth he had no greater credit then the accents have which by the most learned in europe for almost years were still left out and not cared for even by them that translated the hebrew bible nor can well blame them as if they had mightily mistaken in the translation because of the ignorance of these accents as if only by their order the true connexion and distinction of senses could be had

therefore let no english man quoth he think he hath not learned the hebrew tongue

if he know not these accents and the infinity of work in them but rather with me pitty the pains of those painful germans and scots upon such rotten principles and learn hereafter of them to labour upon a sure ground or to think that god hath laid a curse upon his labour sysiphi saxum a stone that will give him an endlesse and unprofitable work and wish this painful man and buxtorf and all those that are so busie about the

pricks and will not believe that excellently and exceedingly learned author capellus french professor at lamar in his arcanum punctorum revelatum printed in the oriental his own at leyden
that they may bestow their pains upon work then about these of the points and the samaritick letters if they or those wherewith the bible is now printed be the true old hebrew character when as both are of the same essence and one no more true then the other all that can be said for accents is that one accent may do the businesse· lifting up the syllable where it is they are unreasonably and without sense called grammatical and rhetorical for rhetorick speaks not of accents
and much more from pag to pag

alas poor souls have ye no better guides then points vowels accents no marvel ye have been no better then blind guides to the blind who are no better guided your selves into the whole sacred truth and secret councel of god then by such dimunitive twinckling sparks as these that ye have kindled and compast your selves about with and walk by the light of which are so far from rendering other things discernable that ye cannot yet distinctly discern either what or where they are your selves
do ye expe infallible direction from such a or walking fire that leads you into such brakes of contention and bogs of vncertainty that ye are fain to confesse ye know not well where ye are but in a wood in a way and businesse wherein all things are carried to and fro by utter conjectures pag
while are beating your selves about after it and beating one another about it tremble to think what will become of you indeed and what will be the issue of this supposition that letters and tittles and undefined span alphabet that ye are tattling endlesly about and points and vowels and accents and such accidental attomes as are not essential to the text much lesse pertaining de esse to the holy truth should be for guides
but in general this know that till ye come to the infallible spirit and light within that leads if your letter lye not into all truth such as follow it whether they be such as have skill in your points vowels and accents yea or no ye may walk on in the light of your own fire and the sparks that ye have kindled but this you must expect at last from the lords own hand to lye down in shaking shame and sorrow
one thing more i.o and more remarkable then the rest of thy confused and pedling work about these points is the flat contradicton that thou givest to thy self herein as well as often in many more points and that thy own sayings concerning them in some places give to what thou utterest of them in some other which shall here set before thee and the world as it lyes in thy own words that thou mayst see how rawly thou runnest forth in hast to render thy self ridiculous to all men by thy indigested doings in which thou art justly left of the lord to run in rounds for thy malitious medlings against his people

as to the matter of the scripture remaining entire to a tittle in the outward text of it as at first given out what a fidling and pidling makest thou to prove and make it good what figures dost thou cast in thy fancy throw that part of thy second treatise wherein thou treatest for it for the defending of it and to fence off that fault of falshood from falling upon that thy having once thy far as in thy first treatise as false as frequently to affirm it and yet when all's done after thy tedious tracings to and fro in thy wonted

wood of uncertain talk conjectural discourse and in the toylsome thicker of thy own untrusty thinking thou art fain to confesse enough to the confutation of thy self and the contradicting of that thy position in the strictnesse thereof wherein thou tooth and nail contendest for it as no lesse then a very fundamental part of that faith which was once delivered to the saints

but that may not seem to wrong thee by representing thy archassertion in a stricter way or by stretching or extending it in my animadversions on it beyond the exact measure of thy insert and meaning in it unless thou have us to judge thee one that speakest one thing and meanest another as t.d sayes god which is as bad let the reader together with my returns therto take it in thy own terms as it lies spread and sprinkled up down in sundry expressions sounding out in sum the same thing as to thy purport in them over many parts and in many particular pages of thy two english tractacles

many more exceeding and extraordinary high strict streins thou deliverest thyself in in other places about the non alteration of the text of scripture in one letter tittle iota or syllable since the first giving it out so but that in the copies extant to this day theres an exact unity and entire identity with the first originals a kind of summary collection and of which thou makest pag
speaking to this purpose thus viz

the sum of what am pleading for as to the particular head to be vindicated is that as the scriptures of the old and new testament were immediately and entirely given out by god himself his mind being in them represented unto us without the least interveniency of such mediums and wayes as were capable of giving change or alteration to the least iota or syllable so by his good and merciful providential dispensation in his love to his word and church his whole word alias the scripture with thee as at first given out by him is preserved unto us entire in the original languages where shining in its own beauty and lustre as also in all translations as far as they faithfully represent the originals it manifests and evidences unto the consciences of men without other forreign help or assistance its divine original and authority
reply
this is the capital cardinal general assertion or position which branches it into several particulars or petty propositions viz
the immediate coming forth of the scripture from god to us its self evidencing power to evince it self by it self alone to be of god and his word its descending to us at this day entire to a tittle without corruption by alteration in the least letter iota vowel point or syllable its uncapablenesse of such change and alteration in its coming to us so are thy words here and pag to the least iota or syllable
unto which general head and its branches the lesser twigs or little sentences scattered here and there throwout thy book are reducible and each to its own suitable branch respectively
that which am here under consideration of thy plea for is both its de facto as its handed down by transcribers from the scribes of it to us in these dayes and its unalterablenesse or uncapablenesse of alteration which if thou mean as thou sayest thou here assertest to the least iota or syllable
these are to thee as thou sayest such important truths that thou shalt not be blamed in the least by thy own spirit nor thou hopest by any others in contending for them judging them fundamental parts of the faith once but say thou knowest not when delivered to the saints

reply
though who cannot hold thee because cannot find thee guiltlesse in either thy hasty holding or thy heedlesse unhandy handling thy weak vindicatory piece of probation of them at so high a rate do advise thee to praise a fair day at night assuring thee that if ever thou come to learn the truth in the plainnesse and power of it as it is in iesus the light of whom the letter testifies thou wilt find these no fundamental

parts of that one faith which paul and iude speak of eph
iude which was one even of old from abraham enoch noah and downwards from the beginning before the letter was delivered to and earnestly to be contended for by the saints and wilt find thy own spirit also however it now seems not to blame thee in the least blaming thee nor a little for thy ignorance in due time and howbeit being bolstered up for a while above it by the aery academical applauses gratulatory euge's o's
hic est's and such like blessings of thy blind brother literatists that are as the rich mans wealth to him prov
thy strong city thy murus abaeneus a high brazen wall to thee in thy own conceit thou feel'st no check and seemest nil conscire tibi nullâ pallescere cultâ

yet let others and thy own heart also clear chear and cheat thee as it will thou wilt once know that as to every work there is a time to do it in and a judgment after it so thy whole lame work about the scriptures as well as thy other part of it against the quakers though fenced in the frontispice with the fair formal pretence of a vindication of the purity and integrity of the hebrew and greek texts and pro scripturis and such like must come to another account then that am here taking of it before the world even to a judgment from god within thy own now blinded bosome and closed conscience as the book thereof comes to be opened by the shining out of that light in it that lyes yet smoothered and then thy misery will be so great upon thee that as told thee above what thou sayest of the pope for his misuse of scripture will be verified not on him only in so much the greater measure by how much his vilislations and violations of it may be greater then thine but in some measure also upon thy self so that as thou together with me sayst papae so say

et tibi tempus erit quo magno optaveris emptam scripturam intactam

it will once repent thee not a little in thy own spirit that ever thou appearedst in publick in such a proud and peevish prate against its purest friends so pretensively only but not properly for and so piteously and unpolishedly about the scriptures

now as to thy vindication or plea it self for the present integrity and indentity of the text of your copies with those original copies that were first given out which thou positively hadst before asserted thou failest and fallest short so in thy confidence of what thou hadst so peremptorily propounded for truth in ipso limine at the very threshold and entrance thereinto as to stile it no other then an account of thy apprehensions a delivery of thy thoughts and a runing the hazard of giving out thy thoughts and of what thy own thoughts suggested to thee pag
and a discovery of thy thoughts
as also thy first treatise wherein thou talkst of the samenesse of the letter in every tittle and iota to what it was at first so authoritatively so positively so impositively so seemingly infallibly and uncontroulably a publication of thy thoughts though had thought a minister of christ or doctor in that thing cal'd divinity especially about the foundation of all his faith and in that chapter where he layes the basis of his businesse and of

building should have thought himself better and have down and counted his cost and cast it in his mind before he printed his propositions out in such peremptory terms as thou dost in this case of nonalteration of one jot or tittle of the first divinely inspired scripture pag whether it would hold it out in such a height for certain or no without parching it up with so think and such loose conjectures and as are attended with such great uncertainty that himself confesses as thou dost pag
they ought not to be admitted to any plea or place one way or other in so a cause and propound things that are false as boldly as undoubted truths and then off such as expect with weak conjectures and his conceits men mock him saying this man began to build but was not able to finish
yet now bethink my self thou pretendest to be no divinely inspired prophet nor one that owns any such to be now a dayes but one of those other men thou speakest of pag
the pigment and imagination of whose hearts are the fountain of all that they speak and so no better can be expected from them


thou grantest that ye have not the undefined span alphabet pag nay
it is granted sayest thou pag
that the individual undefined span alphabet of moses the prophets and the apostles are in all probability and as to all that we know utterly perished and lost out of the world as also the copies of ezra the reports mentioned by some to the contrary are open fictions the individual ink and parchment the or books that they wrote could not without a miracle have been preserved from mouldring into dust before this time nor doth it seem improbable that god was willing by their losse to reduce us to a neerer consideration of his care and providence in the preservation of every tittle contained in them had those individual writings been preserved men would have been ready to adore them as the jewes do their undefined span alphabet in their synagogues

reply
how like a child dost thou talk in that groundlesse guesse of thine that god was willing to let the losse of the undefined span alphabet be for such an end as in thy foolish vain mind thou imaginest and fondly fanciest what a bawbling and blerting dost thou make of thy boyish bolts out of the cross bow of thy crooked conceit both here and up and down thy book who told thee that trifling tale which thou tellest for probable truth that god let all the first writings be lost for this end to reduce men in the latter ages to a neerer consideration of his care in preserving every tittle till now that was contained in them when yet we know as told thee above and prove by and from that little of the first scripture that hath happened to come to our hands which ten parts to one of the world never saw neither that not tittles only but many whole books of the first divinely inspired scripture that belonged to the bulk of holy mens writings by the spirit are not preserved but perished for ought thou knowest both the undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet of them also did god himself tell thee this to tell for tsruth or did the serpent suggest it to thy thoughts that suggests a legion more the like lying vanities even he surely insinuated this into thy imagination that crowded those other crude conceptions and conjectures which thou hast and holdest out to such tom of bediams

as will take them for truth from thee

into which piece of gods eternal councel trow who or what spirit or scripture or key of any kind did ever let in who proposes it so peremptorily in his preachings as if god had discovered something by experience after a while that he was not so well acquainted with before namely that manifesting his mind by dreams visions voices word of mouth was after his tryal thereof sufficiently by the lord to be an insufficient means to save his word from loosing which means he intended once to that end and purpose howbeit sometimes again tells us truly enough that what ever means god appoints to any end it is sufficient thereunto and thereupon not imperfect but perfect

and so fearing belike to loose his word and doctrine and not knowing any other way all others failing save that of pen and inke in his providence betook himself to that way of writing which providence also saw it self concerned to this day to preserve entire copies to a tittle of all that writing much of which yet is lost both to reduce men to a consideration of it self in that one particular and also that his word not a jot of which confesse can ever fail though all writing in the world come to perish might be secured for ever from perishing and altering by that most alterable and perishing way of writing which if it should happen to be all lost he had no way to save his word doctrine and sacred truth from dying irrecoverably by a very dreadful and mortal distemper pag
so seems i.o summarily to say out of the sacred secret of gods councel which was never with any save such as fear him more then does whose position of it credat apella

god by his providence preserving the whole text entire suffers lesser variety to fall out in or among the copies we have for the quickning and exercising our diligence in our search into his word

reply
nescio quo horrendo percusse sentomate whence came this whiffe and whimzy within the circumference of thy figmentitious fancy who told thee this toy which thou preachest out for positive truth dost thou teach this for a true doctrine of christ if so from what text

or wilt thou own it to be but a meer tale of thy own a tradition of i.o which it thou wilt then own it that in vain thou worshippest god while thou art teaching for doctrine thy own thoughts and the traditions of thy self or any other men thou talkest sometime at such a rate as if thou wouldst make all the world believe the variety of our copies were absolutely none at all no not in the leaft not in one apex tittle iota not in undefined span alphabet which how contradictory it is to or consistent with that lesser variety here talk'd on who is so silly save whose own silliness and self
confoundings are never seen by himself as not to see but to let passe that ordinary matter of sifh its as common with thee almost as to talk at all and to take it as it falls
is this the end why god who as thou sayest who knowest not whether thou hast the half or no of what was by inspiration written preserved the whole entire suffered that variety that is in your copies to quicken your diligence in your search into his word if that be the end as indeed it may well enough be of the total losse of so much of the letter as there is and nonintegrity nor indentity of your transcript texts that remain that ye should diligently search into his word it were happy for you that there's so much variety and uncertainty as there is in your copies and nere the worse had you none of them at all so ye would betake your selves to the hearing of the word of god and the receiving it more immediately and purely from his mouth which the letter of it tells you is nigh in your own hearts and mouths that ye need not go any where ad extra for it that ye may both hear and do it but alas poor men by the word ye mean the letter still the external text or writing of it and then so far is your so diligent searching and poring and striving and scribling one to another as the scribes of old did iob that never heard the voice and word of god it self from being any end of god at all in giving it out at first or in deriving that part of the scripture ye have down to you whether fully the same with or falsified from the first copies that he loaths and detests your long tales about its tittles and your idle treating away your pretious time in such trivial talk as this that the whole word of god and all saving doctrine and sacred truth is lost and fails for ever without· relief remedy or recovery if every tittle of the text without losse or variation be not upheld and preserved entire to this day which yet is some not to say the sum of that unsound doctrine the proof of which is driven on by thee as in pag

and many other pages is to be seen throwout thy book as well as by other doctors and divines

so pag
speaking of the scriptures uncontroulably manifesting themselve so to be that on pain of eternal damnation men are to receive them as the word of god thou sayst that they afford unto us all the divine evidence of themselves and thats none at all as shall shew anon of their being his word which god is willing to grant us or can be granted us or is any way needful for us

reply
another odd conceited saying this is as like thy self who thy self still as to thy usurped authoritativenesse but

seldom as to the truth of thy assertions as if it were spit out of thy mouth who told thee this vntruth that thou so uncontrollably utterest here for truth that god is not willing to grant more divine evidence of the scriptures being what thou falsly sayest they are or where they are indeed and that more neither can or need be granted then what the scriptures themselves do afford sayest thou this of thy self or did others tell it thee of the scripture of thy own head surely or very likely at least and neither from god nor the spirit nor the scriptures no nor the synods nor the congregational churches of england to which thou belongest nor the doctrinal catechismes of late divines for these thy brethren though erring with thee in stiling them the word tell thee of another not humane onely but divine testimony or evidence that may be and is needful to be granted and that god is willing to and doth also grant of the scriptures being what they call it beside that which thou here so absolutely assertest as the onely one that must or can be afforded viz the testimony of the spirit of god in the heart and not that of the scripture alone concerning itself or of the holy spirit speaking without us ad extra onely in the scripture which is the dream wherein thou drawest aside not onely from the truth but also if it were a truth that the letter is word from the joynt testimony of thy fellow testifiers to it for they say the testimony of the spirit within us also not stimony without and onely in the scripture divinely evidences the scripture to be what ye all falsly say it is that is the word of god witnesse not only that so much esteemed divine in his dayes viz
ball in his catechisme but also the confession of faith of the assembly of divines presented to the parliament and that of the congregationals which is verbatim the same also therewith who all unanimously in that article of the scripture wherein they falsely affirm it to be the word of god declare thus in the fifth head viz by the heavenlinesse of the matter efficacy of doctrine majesty of the stile excellency and perfection of the whole it doth abudantly evidence it self to be the word of god yet notwithstanding our full perswasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof of the scripture is from the inward work of the holy spirit bearing witnesse by and with the word in our hearts

but thou in page
and thorowout thy fifth chapter of thy first treatise excludest the witnesse of the spirit immediately in the heart at all or at least the usefulnesse much more the necessity of any such testimony making as here page
the authority of god shining in it self alone and exclusively of the spirits and words witnesse in our hearts the sole medium of all that evidence which man can have of its being what ye call it viz
the word of god but as for god and the spirit who within do give all the evidence that they give at all of the scriptures being what in truth is is viz a true writing of the truth what if they are willing to grant an evidence within and to afford more then thou talkst of wilt thou bind limit and forbid them so to so who unlimitedly here declarest that god is willing to afford and grant no more must not the spirit blow where it lifts without thy leave or acquainting thee first who art no prophet with what he will do and this may serve as a sufficient answer to thy vain opinion in it it being worth no better to that whole chapter of thine concerning

the testimony of the spirit though whether it shall or no so that i'le say no more to thee about that chapter is more then ile tell thee here that may be at liberty to do as see occasion only thus much is spoken to that saying of thine above pag to shew how majestically still for the eternal truths of god thou tellest thy own meer trashy untrusty traditions of which sort say is that above which am yet in hand with viz that god probably suffered the losse of the undefined span alphabet to reduce us to a consideration of his care in preserving every tittle that was in them to this day in the undefined span alphabet or copies we have

but seems to take another reason out of the bottomlesse pit of his own infinite fancy and imagination why god was as willing to let the first manuscripts perish as careful to preserve every apex thereof in their adored transcripts and successively crowned and canonized copies to this day viz left if the immediate individual writings had been preserved men would have been ready to adore them as the jewes to adore their undefined span alphabet in their synagogues

reply which if it be cogent or have any reason at all in it to prove a willingnesse in god to let the first writings be left hath it not as much to the full to evince god regardlesnesse of your so copiously regarded copies upon if there were no other the very account as he was so carelesse of the other but is so totally talpified that as eagleeyed as he is abroad to spie a hole in the iewes coat he can't see that iewish idolatry neerer home for if god to prevent adoration of that brazen serpent and idolized undefined span alphabet of the scripture was so regardlesse of it as to permit it to perish and be brought to nothing is there not as much reason why he should be as carelesse of your remote tottered transcripts and false translations ye are so carkingly careful of as to let what will become of them notwithstanding your uncessant pining and whining and whoring after them and solicitous scoldings and tearings one of another so much about them for as much as though ye confesse ye have but the undefined span alphabet yet so it is that ye adore and even idolize them as much as ye would or likely could the undefined span alphabet themselves had you them to bustle and busie your minds about and as much as the iewes though ye advance them the right way no more then they do theirs as have told you at large above do their undefined span alphabet in their synagogues
suppose ye had here the very hand writings of moses and the old prophets and the individual letters and stories that the evangelists and apostles pen'd with their own hands yea the very two tables of stone superscribed with gods own finger which was a figure and type of that handwriting of his law in the fleshly tables of your hearts by his living spirit the truth and of which ye as little heed as ye heedlesly the other what could you ministers of the letter and not the spirit and your literal and formal more then powerful and truly spiritual professours say or do more unlesse you would down on your knees to them so soon as ever ye see them in way of outward honour and adoration thereof then ye do to your falsified transcripts and your people to the more unspeakably false translations which they take for truth but by tradition and meer implicite faith from your selves lets reason

and reckon with you here a little while about your transcripts and translations which are all that are extant and enjoyed at this day the first by you that have skill in hebrew and greek the second by your independent on god but on their priests lips dependent people as for the undefined span alphabet
memorandum oh all people by whom these presents shall ever happen to be read hath quite quitted the world of them confessing they are all utterly perished and long since past away and lost so that tis opon fiction or with him for any one to affirm that there's any one individual role writing or book that was pen'd by the holy men that in their several successive ages wrote the scripture now alive and not mouldred into dust so that the world hath done with them and they with us so as never to come within our ocular inspection more whereby to try whether our doctors and divines adored transcripts do to a little agree as absolutely affirms they do with the touchstone yea or nay so as to believe our own eyes or any otherwise then as who first positively asserts it doth after as improbly conclude it from what is suggested to his own thoughts from and other mens talk to and fro and tradition and as he confesses all along heap of vncertainties and conjectures so that all the tumblings and tossings snapings and snarlings of even the protestant divines about their scriptmre is but about their remote transcribed cannot say well neither for most transcribed copies too are out of the way since printing came up but printed copies of the text which are all not more lyable in any thing to be then in many things they are already falsified which since the primitive copies are concluded to be gone and the infallible guidance of the spirit by and all divines excluded out of the world also though they tell us translations must be rectified by their transcriptions yet if they happen to be as an hundred to one they are and none knows in how many in any things crooked or various from the first there's no means of rectifying or reducing their supposed rule to conformity to the first literal rule nor of amending it any otherwise then uncertainly for ever
but suppose say ye had the primitive copies could you make more ado in adoring them then ye doctors and your people that dote on you do about your various respective transcripts and more various translations out of them into sundry tongues and languages which translations yet are all in somethings not more several in their sorts then the tongues into wch they are translated and divided into as many senses as the many men that translated them thereinto which said numerous untrue translations also are as to the letter if they look not to the light within and live not by that all that the poor blindly guided people who ken not hebrew and greek many of whom can't read english neither have to trust to whose faith about the scripture it self which thou callst pag
the foundation of that faith and obedience god requireth at their hands and whose belief of the truth or untruth of this or that translation is as much pin'd upon the priests sleeve here in england still as it is at rome it self in this and some other matters for there they believe as their church clergy believes and take things on trust being not suffered if they were able as here though suffered they are not able to try the truth

yea do ye not all as well the people that have no better then their uncertain yet certainly untrue translations from you as so many of you of the clergy as can read the copies of the originals for many cannot read the hebrew text at all and some the greek as as that as necessary as these tongues were made a while since to the very esse or being of christs ministers who have no better your uncertain transcriptions cry up your several transcribed and translated copies respectively that best like you and every one hugge his own at least as most insallible however crying down others as corrupted and how beit if any one of them were so as none of them at all are yet all of them can't be right as each one faith that is that he takes are ye not all noysing it out as the iewes at and the gentiles at ephesus jer

as for all translations that may not wrong thee but give thee thy due thou givest them their due confesse in some measure so as to slate them a little lower then either the true word of god or the first true immediate manuscripts of it either
yea must needs say that though by some expressions and denominations thereof as namely that of the word of god partly at least thou settest them above themselves yet thou pullest them down so far below thy idolized meer imperfect images of the frost writings that to say the truth within a little thou as much disparagest the very best of them as they are commonly counted as beyond measure thou manifiest thy own insomuch that the whole scene of sections in thy last chapter of thy second treatise seems to be set to drive on no other design then a louder decrying of all translations then that of theirs whom thou cryest out on for decrying thy transcriptions or then thy own crying up of them yea thou dost not more strictly and absolutely avouch that untruth concerning the absolute unity of your copies of the original both with the first originals and among themselues without any discrepancy in the least then in that chapter principally and partly elsewhere viz pag
thou avowest and purtest thy self to prove that vast variety that is in all translations among themselves and that deep discrepancy that is in them also from both the first original text and your transcripts of it which variety discrepancy and corruption yet that is in them thou art so far from covering from the view of the vulgar whose souls interest lies mainly in translations they being not able to read the original text as their soul sayst thou and bodily interests also say are concerned in your transcription that thou openly proclaimest it that all may see it as it were upon the house top and lest

any should be startled at so strange a sight as thou presentest them with in that chapter as that vast variety of translations of the text from the originals of it and each from other and begin to question whether that be the incorruptible word of god or no which so many corruptions could creep and are crept into thou art so shamelesse as to help an old lame dog ore a stile as the proverb is so as to render these so many of the literal sense and meaning of the original words which the translators moped into till they have torn and twined the waxen nose of your naked letter whereby may see what a sixt and firm foundation true touchstone stable standard inalterable rule infallible guide incorruptible word of god ye have among you while you trust and stand to no other word then your outward letter defying that within in the heart which the quakers point you to into more then twice if not twenty times twenty several shapes as an eminent help oh horrid to the manifesting of the mind of god unto men witnesse thy own words pag at thy very entrance into that thy talk against translations which are these

to
to have it represented to us at one view the several apprehensions and iudgements of so many worthy and learned men as were the authors of these and of the various translations upon the original words of the scripture is a signal help and aduantage vnto men enquiring into the mind and will of god in his word
reply
was the like odd conceit ever heard of or digested with the receipt of it for truth any where but among onr academical conjecturers and adorers of one anothers silly thoughts that not unity but variety in the translations of the letter occasioned by the various thoughts and opinions of men that translated one about the spirit sense of the same words should be signally helpful towards any thing but the confused fightings that the world is filled with about their many senses and meanings on the letter and that our ministers fill the world with as well about their divers transcriptions as different translations is much more then folly and little lesse then madnesse to imagine

ah poor common people you of the tongues nations and kindreds of the earth that understand neither the language of your academical canaanites nor yet the true language of the land of canaan it pities me for you still to see how all things are carried in the clouds out of your sight for not standing in the counsel of god the light in your own heart nor asking counsel of god but at your stoical students stocks and stones you know not the mind of christ that way and as for your untrusty that talk of truth to you for tyth but turn truth out of doors and turn all things down whose doings in that kind must be esteemed ere long as the potters clay isa
as for these say they dig deep to hide their councel not only from the lord who yet in his people sees them well enough but from you also their own people who own them so that all their works to are done in the dark so that ye behold not what strange transpositions transcriptions and translations of things there are among them and such as tell you plainly how

they wrest the scripture like a nose of wax which way it may best serve their interests they hate so that of those that have tumbled in the same belly and sprang from same university mothers womb and bowels with them whose breasts the suck at vel duo vel nemo my self and very few more are escaped thence alone to tell you they make you believe that that is the word of god in your bibles which is seen with your bodily eyes even the very letters syllables and every tittle of writing which ye there see which writing we confesse testifies of that word of god which gives the life but alas is the word of god so flexible alterable that it can be changed which is indeed eternally the same into as many shapes and senses as there are men setting their senses on work to transcribe translate and expound it nay friends gods word is stable and permanent and not a tittle of that can be turned besides it self by the tattling tongues and pidling pens of men that for money make it their whole lives businesse to transcribe translate interpret and give you their thoughts upon this and that and tother text till throw the throng of their thoughts and the mists of their meanings and and ye can see little of that they have translated for you out of uncertain transcripts which yet they make you believe are in stedfast vnity with the originals and each other though they confesse your translations to good use and purpose too if you will believe them are all unspeakably differing both from the first copies of scripture and each other also

as to the state and condition of translations which it is o's drift to discover the corruption of in order to the upholding the credit as to of his transcriptions he takes and gives a view of the chief of them as they lye in the biblia polyglotta
of the arabick he tells us pag
that should be gather instances of the failings of this translation open and grosse and so proceed with the rest be thinkes he might make a volumne neer as big as that of the various lections afforded in the aforesaid bible
of the syriach he sayes pag that it was made hfe knows neither when nor by whom and that in sundry places it evidently follows another corrupt translation passed throw the hands of men ignorant and suspitious against whose frauds and follies by reason of the paucity of copies we have no relief

reply
observe by the way how when he speaks derogatively of translations he vilifies translators as full of fraud folly ignorance suspitious as if they were untrusty and not fit to be heeded as if they were full of oscitancy and negligence occasioning miscarriages and mistakes in their translatings as if they were such as had nothing to do with god but with heathen authors in transcribings but when he speaks
arrogatively of transcriptions then pag
the transcribers considering that what they transcribed was every tittle and iota of it the word of the great god wherein the eternal concernment of their own and others souls did lye and knowing they had to do with the living god belike the translators considered and knew no such thing that the work under their hands was

of the same concernment to souls shall we think that men in transcribing tully homer aristotle would be as careful as they we think it not tolerable in a christian to argue so we scarce think the roman pontifices going solemnly to transcribe the sybils verses would do it either negligently or treacherously or alter one tittle from what they found written and shall we entertain such thoughts of them who knew they had to do with the living god and that in and about that which is dearer to him then all the world besides why then dost thou entertain such course thoughts of translations j.o had not they to do with god in the same that was as thou cloudily conceivest for though the word is yet the latter is not so dearer to him then the whole world yea and sometimes when thou talkest of corrupt novel transcripts thou hast the same ill thoughts of transcribers and accusest them when their copies are quoted against thee to prove various lections for malicious depraving as much as thou excusest them at other times yea thou canst not think the romane pontifices would mistranscribe sybils prophecies in one tittle negligently or treacherously yet dost entertain such thoughts of them about the scripture in which who hath to do hath to do with the living god whether in transcribing translating or interpreting and inveighest against them as betraying falsifying vitiating interpolating altering adding detracting and what not to the corrupting of the scripture
ep
oh the pure that runs in of the samaritane pentateuch he sayes the places instanced in by morinus do prove it corrupt
of the chaldee paraphrase he sayes
that seeing it did not lye under any peculiar care and merciful prouidence of god whether innumerable faults and errours as it happened with the septuagint may not be got into it who can tell saith himself and say who can tell that this or that transcription lay more under the peculiar care and merciful providence of god which so much insists on then this or that translation yet will be telling out his thoughts still for absolute truths
of the vulgar latine that its of an uncertain originall its corruptions and barbarisms its abuse so much hath been spoken of and by so many already that it were to no purpose to repeat it
of the
that all things about it are uncertain and nothing almost manifest concerning it but that it is wofully corrupt and that translation the
either from the mistakes of its first authors or the carelesnesse or ignorance or worse of the transcribes mark how here shrewdly suspects transcribers of carelesnesse or gods carelesnesse over them whom at other times he says shall we think they were oscitant or negligent lying under a merciful aspect and providence of god is corrupted or gone off from the original in a thousand places twice told and that its a corrupt stream a lesbian rule
on the account of which and some others no whit better or scarce so good are exhibited
various lections with insinuation of an infinite number more and
if the ability of the authors be urged
and granted an unlikely to erre so much what security quoth have we of their principles and honesty

say as much as we have of either the ability principles and honesty of thy so implicitly trusted to transcribers what warrant more hast thou to hold all transcribers more trusty then these that were for ought is kuown the first and the most translators in the world insomuch that

whether translated or mistranslated priests more on it then on your hebrew copies yet thou citest cardinal ximineus whereby we see popish authors when siding with you are cited by you as authentick as others of this so much adored and even idolized translation that it is sometimes supersluous and sometimes wanting
and cardinal

also whom thou citest and creditest that it is as a corrupt translation out of the text so it felt corrupt and vitrated and
eiting hierom as so saying thou sayest it is corrupt interpolated mingled and that there were so many copies of it and they so varying that no man knowes what to follow and if a translation may so be why the original it self may no so be by many various copies he must be a wiser man than that knows of the and persian translations of the new testament he sayes
that he supposes it may sately be said they are the worst and most corrupt that are extant in the world and of the he saith it is no whit better but a novell endeavour of an illiterate person and of all in grosse he sayes thus in the same page that would be make it his businesse to give instances of the mistakes ignorance falsifications errours and corruption of these translators who ere they were iews or christians his discourse would swell into a volume and lastly
also thou without exception of any all translations which is all the people have so far below transcriptions which ye linguists have as to say thus of them viz
translations the word of god and are the of god perfectly or imperfectly according as they expresse the sense and meaning of those originals and of the transcriptions ye linguists have to advance any all translations as concurring into an equality with the original so to set them by it as to set them up with it on even terms is to set up an altar of our own by the altar of god and to make equal the wisdome skill and diligence of men with the wisdom care and providence of god himself
so saith featly
of his dipters the bible translated is not the undoubted word of god but so far onely as it agreeth with the original which as am informed none of you understand quoth he to wil kiffis and the other russet rabbies he disputed with

reply
first then observe that by your own confession all that poor people have which is bare translation is but an altar of your own setting

up among them not gods altar for thou callest transcription the altar of god or the issue of the wisdom care and providence of god himself but translation an altar of your own the issue of the wisdom providence and diligence of man onely that must not be reckoned on as gods word nor stand in equall esteem with the scriptures ye scribes enjoy

alas poor people you and yours must be thrust out still as christ was into the manger for whom there was no room in the inne ye must be content with shame to keep at your distance from your doctors and lordly scholars and to take the lowest room they must have a dominion over you and your faith too and you must never fare and feed so high as them but in the stable as rusticks or but russet rabbies among the bruits and be glad to snap at a crust and be fed at their dispose from their pens and mouths with a bit and a bite if you put not into their mouths and pay not you shot well too for that short commons and poor pasture ye have from them those scriptures they or some one of many among them can read in greek and hebrew are quoth entirely to a tittle preserved without losse though but remote transcriptions by fallible men answerable to the first immediate manuscripts that were written by inspiration from god the word of god perfectly duly advanced into an equality and even terms for remember not where in all his book he puts the transcripts though know and he acknowledgeth that in some things there are varieties among them too below the first manuscripts with that given out at first every apex of which

is equally divine and if a man be to be beleeved when he speaks falsly or foolishly for want of fear or wit as immediately from god as the voice wherewith or wherein be spake to or in the prophets but this is mear for your masters or little lesse then forbidden at least hidden fruit from you who what light soever ye have from god yet have not learning enough to let you into an intermedling with the open secrets of their living dead letter as for your scripture which is but translation out of theirs hear what they say of it who exalt it far above it self into a participation thy the halves of the same high prerogatives with theirs and a taste of that glorious

title the word of god yet so as that it must know it self too and not intrude further into it then they give leave by their right or wrong renditions of it ont of their for ever to be adored copies who in the blinduesse of their busie brains vanity and follishnesse of their thoughts and fleshly wisdom that's enmity against god and enters no farther into the inside of the scripture than the of a mole into a milstone may render it as it seems best to themselves and you lack lingua little the wiser and if they give your scripture an inch it must take heed of taking an ell for as there's a bit so there's a knock if it presume too far its admitted to be the word of god with theirs but not on even terms theirs wholly and euery apex of it yours but by the halues or so far onely as it corresponds with theirs from which if it offer to vary by theirs it must be corrected castigated in order to its amendment in time to come theirs being

perfectly the word of god yea every tittle of it the living word of the great god though but transcribed as yours is but translated in the wisedom skill and diligence of men yours imperfectly and perfectly too perfectly or imperfectly according as yours expresse the words sense and meaning of their origina's so that though it can be counted no robbery for theirs which is but the fruit of mans wisdom skill and diligence and as now transcribed was not as is confest received immediately from god

to be made equall with that which was at first received more immediately from him as the fruit of his wisdom care and providence yet its robbery for yours that comes but as theirs doth through the skill wisdom and diligence of men and within a small matter as immediately from god as theirs doth to be equall with theirs and howbeit they may lawfully without pride set up their meer transcriptions so as to make them sir cheek by chole with the first and set up their own altar or altered copies of hebrew and greek with that higher altar of god even the letter or first copy and set up mans posts by gods posts even both the first manuscripts and their own tottered transcripts too into an equallity of titles honour power perfection authority necessity with the true living word of god which the first and truest scripture that ever was was at best but a true scripture writing or declaration of yet your posts and altars and scriptures must keep aloof and not come so nigh theirs as theirs to gods without a check
by all wch thats here written in this apostrophe to you poor deluded people ye may see what a low condition ye are deprest into till you betake your selves to the light of god within which was before any letter to writing was without which the scriptures cry up call you to while your scribes cry it down cry out against it and call you from it ye may see how ye are thrust out with a pueri sacer est locus extra meijete meddle not here ye mechanicks ye unlearned laicks from the lines of their communication by your fanatical fantastical high flown haughty haebricians and greedy graecians that for filthy lucre take the oversight of or rather over you and that take upon them by force to be your guides before whom you are fain to stand like some poor stupified peasant before his prince to whom if the one say but rex sum sic uolo sic jubeo so mean to have it the other hath no more to do but ineak away nor to say but amen so be it nil ultra quaero plebeius

it follows then that none but schollars have the undoubted word of god for people understand not original tongues nor many priests the and so though they say hear the word of god they have no undoubted word of god to preach out of it while they take their texts out of english bibles
so people and blind priests have no undoubted infallible rule touchstone to try truth by for if this he so how is the scripture as they have it the most perfect rule to them both people and illiterate priests must either get hebrew and greek or else confesse that they live as much by tradition in england taking things on trust from the priests without tryall as they do at rome for what difference between having scripture no scripture in the mother tongue when notwithstanding that which is so had men cannot be sure which is the word of god which not but as the

priests tell them so and if priests be minded to deceive them they may translate it to their own turn as they please and people ne're the wiser so make the scripture as a nose of wax to stand to themselves lead the world by the nose as they have ever done which way soever they will

so confesse that see the scriptures as taken for the translations set somewhat lower by thee than the first manuscripts and then your transcriptions in the place above quoted yet entitled too with the name of the word of god in part but your transcriptions to an apex are equalized with the first manuscripts and both these elsewhere wholly with the light and living word
it is then the meer transcripts and neither the first manuscripts nor translations that thou talkest so exceeding strictly for the non alteration or of in a title the undefined span alphabet being lost out of the world and translations excluded the lists thy apologetical vindication of the scripture in the externall text thereof in vindication of which transcriptions of the hebrew and greek texts not appearing at all for the english save quatenus agreeing with the other
thou talkst on argumentatively as follows
arg
to prove the whole scripture memorandum of old and new testament to remain entire to this day without ablation or alteration of it in one undefined span alphabet or tittle thou urgest
the providence of god in taking care of his word which he hath magnified over all his name as the most glorious product of his wisdom and goodnesse his great concernment in this world answering his promise to this purpose
rep
this leads the front of that ragged regiment of arguments which follow it at the heels in


being no lesse than
in number or a whole iury impannel'd to try this case of which this is the foreman that speaks more then they all for its insisted on or hinted at or'e and o're and or'e in know not how many places of thy book as if thou laydst more stresse and purrest more trust in this than in all the rest and indeed though it is a most piteous poor one yet seeing know no better it may be called as its rank'r before the rest the very best in all the pack
let's see then what force this consideration viz the love providence care and promise of god to his church and word engaging for the preservation and continuance of it to a tittle without losse hath in it to evince the entirenesse of the hebrew and greek text to a tittle

that the love
care and providence of god is to or ore his church and so ore his word for his churches sake deny not in the least and that his word he speaks he magnifies ore all his name as the most glorious product of his wisdom and goodness as his great concernment in this world dearer to him than all the world besides which his promise is for the continuance of it so inalterably entire and uncorrupt that heaven and earth it self shall pass away as christ saies matth

before one jot and tittle thereof shall fail or pass away and that not one apex tittle or point of that hath yet failed or been altered or is liable for capable to be altered

or corrupted all this grant for his word is the incorruptible seed that lives and abides for ever
but what's all this to thy purpose whose talk is only about the outward writings image copy letter text which talks of that word and who producest all this to prove every tittle of that text to be entire

wilt thou never learn to put or at least to keep that difference which somtimes when thou art deliberate thy self between the word that is written of and the text which is the meer writing of it dost not thou
though know thou blindly blendest them together both there and throughout thy book make the undefined span alphabet the writing the book the letter one thing and the faith word doctrine declared in it another dost thou not distinguish now and then as every wise man does ever between the text it self that talks of the truth and the truth it self which the text talks on we know the truth and faith and doctrine and word of god which is but one and the same in its nature essence being and substance whether written or not written of whether cloathed or not cloathed in this or that outward accidental forme whether displaying it self through the vail of the letter or shewing it self more immediately in its naked native lustre is to a tittle the same now that it ever was in substance though all the shadowy discoveries of it wax old
and vanish and as a vesture are folded up and changed and pass away as a scrole that's roled up and grows out of date when all letters and literal appearances of it shall be mouldered away
the word was before the letter was aud is neither more nor less what it was now the letter is and will be no less than it was of old or what now it is as to its preservation in every point when the letter shall be no more
so that what are all thy propositions about gods promise and providence and love and care of his church and word to evince or prove the entire preservation of every iot and tittle of an outward text or an old uncertain transcript of what was by the holy men of god some thousands of years since written between which word and the writing or light and the letter which leads only to it there's no more proportion as may shew thee more anon than is between the lanthorn and the light the glass window and the sun that shines through it or then as thy self intimatest there is between the ark and the testament or covenant that for a while was used to be kept in it
dost not thou count the letter the ark
saying the iews have now the letter as somtimes they had the among the philistims to their further ruine and
for my own part am sollicitous for the ark or the sacred truth of the original
yea such proportion say as the ark that kept it bore to the letter of the old testament that was laid up in it the same doth the old testament it self the whole undefined span alphabet or bare letter or shadowy dispensation bear unto the light word of god or new testament which is not a literal but a spiritual administration

now as it would be and absurdity in the abstract for a man to argue the light to be the proper name of the lanthorn which exhibits it the sun the proper name of the glass it shines through and the writing or

letter of the old testament the proper name of the ark in which it was laid up and then to affirm all the properties that appertain peculiarly to the light sun letter belong to the lanthorn glass ark respectively and to plead from the unchangeableness of the light the permanency of the sun the long duration of the letter
some of which in some uncertain copies abides to this day that the lanthorn is unalterable the window inviolable the ark abiding the self same and not one jor or inch of it is lost or altered to this day but in all points in the same that it was when moset made it because some copies imagess and pictures of it are found painted on walls aud printed in books or so to this day semblably as ridiculous it is to the full to argue the letter is immediately come to us from god without interveniency of any medium obnoxious to fallibility the text is not capable to be altered not is altered in one tittle so but that its intirely the same that it was at first in every point syllable and iota because the light faith doctrine truth and word which is as the sun the same still and preserved in the providence of god full firm and sure as all the ordinances of heaven are whether it shews it self through a glass only or without it

now then howbeit we own all that which tells of the providential care and promise of god as to the preserving of his word to his church to be true as told of his word yet as spoken of the letter as gods great concernment in this world dearer to him than all the world the most glorious product of his wisdom and goodness and such like and as urg'd in proof of the text and each tittle of that to be entire and eternal as the heavens say as so every tittle of it is false
and would fain know of what text of scripture god ever made such a promise in concerning the text or the scripture that he would in his care and providence preserve every titt'e of that outward writing for his church and his words sake which was written at the motion of his spirit so that it never should be so in any tittle of it but that in the greek and hebrew copies not english mark that nor any translated but only transcribed copies he would keep it from being so adulterated vitiated altered depraved and interpolated as not to be every jot the same verbatim as at first say where is that promise so made to this purpose which his providence is so engaged to answer is it in isa
the place thou quorest together with a whole nest of others to the same end
viz matth
pet
cor
matth

not one of which make one jot of mention of the letter text or any tittle thereof at all

that in isaiah there cited is hinted at and harp upon to the same tune in or pages in thy treatise viz
in all which more or less in whole or part thou talkest much of the transcribers lying under a loving and careful aspect from the promise and providence of god in beir transcribing alluding all along to
as if god had there engaged himself by promise as it were to guide their hands that they should not erre in a tittle for his word and churches sake but is there the least tittle of such a promise there made and look it again and see if there be such a thing touche upon in the least either expressly or implicity undefined span alphabet as thou speakst or by consequence either

immediate or far fetcht the words are these to the church under the new covenant or gospel my words which have put into thy mouth shall not depart out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed from henceforth for ever here confesse is a promise to keep his words in the mouths of his servants under the gospel in the latter dayes especially so that they shall by word of mouth and writing bear testimony against the world to his truth and name even the whole seed of the righteous successively for ever without fail as now they begin to do even and sucklings out of whose mouths and stammering lips the lord is speaking to reprove the world and the proud doctors pharisaical selfseeking teachers and to convince all ungodly ones of their ungodly deeds and hard speeches they speak against him in his saints in whom he comes to judgement but what's this to the preservation of o's
greek and hebrew texts to a tittle without alteration this is not spoken of the continuance of any outward scripture but of that word of faith in the heart and mouth which the apostles rom
preacht to turn men to telling them twas nigh and they need not look without for it was ever man so bemoped as to draw such a conclusion as thou dost from that scripture viz that every tittle of the text of scripture given out of old should be secured without one jot of losse to the worlds end and if that were the promise there made it was never made good since as is shewed above the scriptures of sundry whole prophecies and epistles written by inspiration are lost since then nay rather and indeed that text produces a truth which thou deniest that in the last dayes his word and spirit shall be de novo so poured out shed abroad and planted in the heares of his handmaids and servants sons and daughters that they shall prophesie and reach as of old by word of mouth his word as put into them by god himself yet
know not how often betakes himself to that text to make good his talk of the eternal entirenesse to a tittle of his outward text in the greek and hebrew transcripts thereof without which the word is as true entire and secure as it is when the text is entire when the text is torn to pieces and every tittle of it mouldred away
beside if that were a promise of preserving the text it must evince the text is to endure for ever world without end as the word it self doth for its never to depart for ever from the seed that it's there promised to but confesses the scripture is not to abide for ever in its use which is onely faith he ex

obj
and if urge as he does in effect that it's true the word and doctrine and truth is the thing promised to be continued for ever primarily but consequentially the letter and it's tittles for as much as without it be preserved in that and that be preserved entire to a tittle the word it self cannot be preserved from corruption

rep he had as good have told me as soon should have believed him in it that because moses by gods appointment made an ark to lay the book tables and letter in the two tables and letter written on it could not last any longer then the ark or be kept from being lost any where

be not kept so entire that not one bit or scrap of it be broken or lost there is no hopes that ever the light should shine out or be kept alive or be beheld yea if one inch of horn or a nail or the least pin about the ark had happened to be shattered or got any knock or any odd corner of it be broken off with being carried jumbled or tossed to and sro between israel and the philistines there had been no means of preserving the letter from being lost or as if one should say the glasse window is set up that the sun may shine through it therefore suppose that to be crackt or to have any flawes in it or to suffer the losse of but one little piece of a pane there's no likelihood of enjoying the clear bright beams of the sun more distinctly or at any certainty nor can be satisfied unquestionably that the sun it self remains inviolate unlesse ye can assure me that there is every bredth of the glassewindow without any losse as it was at first setting up though yet we see now the sun both is the same and is better seen when beheld without a glasse then thorough it and is most clear when the glasse window is taken down and it beheld more immediately in the light that shines from it self he were fit to be canonized for a fool that would count him a very wife man at least as to that affair that should so affirm so let who will esteem of wisedom in this point yet am not such a fool yet or not so wise or something as to believe him howbeit who e're believes or believes him not in such wise as this aforesaid he talks in effect while
he sayes thus without proof as he does most things according to his own vain thoughts as followes viz


the providence of god hath manifested it self no lesse concerned in the preservation of the writings then the doctrine contained in them
rep which is a loud one for many holy prophets writings are lost but not a doit of the doctrine

the writing it self being the product of his own eternall councel for the preservation of the doctrine after a sufficient discovery of the insufficiency of all other means for that end and purpose
rep which is another for the doctrine can never perish if every tittle of the text should

the malice of satan hath raged no lesse against the book than the truth certained in it
rep which is a third
for satan will allow people bibles and texts enough to talk of truth out of so they walk not in truth

it was no lesse crime to be traditor libri then abnegator fidei

rep which is a fourth false tale for the burning the book can't murder the faith as having the light does which with it's fellows have disproved and given reasons against above and while
in answer to capellus his honest grants that the saving doctrine of the scripture as to the matter and substance of it in all things of moment is preserved in the copies of the original and translations that do remain j.o assenting first to it as truth to the overthrowing of himself as he often does that notwithstanding all the errours and mistakes in the most corrupt translations yet every necessary saving fundamentall truth is found sufficiently testified to therein or if he deny that of translations let him

do it and see what a pickle he puts poor people into who upon the account of that denyal will be found not to have all saving truth in their bibles he asserts

that tis not enough to satisfie him that in his doted on transcribed copies of the original the doctrines mentioned are preserved entire every tittle and undefined span alphabet must come under care and consideration or else injury is done to the providence of god towards his church and care of his word and that it will not be found an easie matter upon a supposition of such corruptions of the originals in tittles and points as is pleaded for against him to evince unquestionably that the whole saving doctrine it at first given out from god· continues entire and uncorrupt
rep oh grosse as if the entirenesse of the eternall truth that was before all external text was was now so subjected as to depend on the entirenesse of a tottering text for its security or else is lost for ever and yet yielded to be preserved entire in translations that are corrupt in more then tittles but not to be kept entire in transcriptions if any tittle be therein
that the nature of the doctrine is such that there is no other principle and means of its discovery no other rule or measure of iudging and determining any thing about or concerning it but onely the writing out of which it is taken
rep as if the doctrine comes from the writing when as the writing came from the truth and doctrine

it being wholly of divine revelation and that revelation being exprest onely in that writing
rep absit absurdum de quo vere dicitur quod posito uno sequuntur millia
as if revelation were not made more truely clearly distinctly and immediately by the light and spirit then mediante litera by the mediation of the letter that comes from it in which thou sayst revelation only is made before which yet the doctrine was revealed
that upon any corruption supposed in the transcript copies of the originall but not the translations theres no means of rectifying the doctrine
rep no by no means its like as if the spirit and light could not now possibly reveal it as easily as at first and as if truth were not as equally by the spirit exposed to the understanding of men in all ages as in some and as if pure revelation were not made now by the light and spirit of truth which depends solely on revelation as it ever did and not on a letter that came from it

thus much to the first of those scriptures urged by thee to prove the promise of god to preserve the scripture even every tittle of the external texts in transcripts not translations for ever and the second is like unto it viz math

where though christ talks of not one undefined span alphabet or tittle failing he that shall understand him speaking there of the outward writing and outward tittles of the law of it many tittles and books of which were lost before that and not of the light it self which is that law the letter is but a copy of and of the word it self that christ speaks which is that that is heard by his sheep onely in the heart and that comes immediately from his own mouth understands neither what he says nor whereof he affirmes yet in three places

quotes it to evince the integrity and identity of every tittle of the text as twas at first viz

the third is as little alias not one jot not tittle to purpose pet

where peter speaks no more of any outward texts or transcripts then if he had said nothing at all nor of such a corrupting thing as manuscripts texts and transcripts titles and dead letters are but of the incorruptible seed the word of god that liveth and endureth for ever ver
even the word of the gospel which was that word of faith paul also writes of rom
which was preached by the apostles and testified to by them and their scripture and moses scripture deut
and all outward scripture that its nigh within in the heart and mouth
the fourth viz cor
no verse of which is quoted is so far from adding a cubit to cause about the scripture that there's no mention made of any scripture at all thoroughout the whole chapter so that what verse he should infer or scrue any thing from to evince the scripture to be entire to a tittle can't imagine
paul tells of things he had delivered to them before it were by word of mouth or epistle he intimates not there but whether it were by orall preaching or writing is much at one to for if by writing which serves most yet he means not the writing it self or epistle but undefined span alphabet the things he delivered as he did to the thessalonians
thes
by word or epistle and if will have it so that twas by a former epistle then he serves me against and himself more than himself against me acknowledging the first epistle of paul to corinth which he wrote before the first of the two we have and mentions
cor to be authentick and canonical and so that a whole canonical epistle of that holy apostle and that's more than a tittle or undefined span alphabet is utterly lost
the fifth viz math

teaching them to observe whatever command you and so am with you alway even to the end of the world which way can from thence conclude a promise for every tittle of inspired scripture to be preserved for ever entire without losse or alteration see not but see one thing that if hobble but upon a text of scripture he thinks at a venture it must serve his turn about the entirenesse and integrity of the text and its tittles though there be no mention of scripture made at all in it· for here's none in this in which christ bids them teach the nations to observe what he commanded them and that they did he promised then to be with them alway to the end of the world as he was and is ever with his people by his light word they being turned to it themselves but what's all this to the tittles of hebrew and greek texts unlesse say they are the christ that he meant when he laid will be with you never did see men in two books so miserably wrest and scripture on pretence of vindicating scripture as and do
yea there is scarce any or but very few of all the scriptures thou quotest in all thy books but thou pervertest them more or lesse as does the most if not all he meddles with whether about the scripture or the word or foundation or rule or what ever else

and as for these five last examined if thou hadst not sent me to them to that end should as soon of my self have gone to seek a dolphin in the woods as lookt into any one of them to find god promising in his love to his church and word and in order to the preserving of them both to be carefull to set his providence so on work as to lay the transcribers of the scriptures in the hebrew and greek tongues but not the of them into other tongues in which yet his care and love to his church though not to the clergy that trade out of their original texts would as much appear and his truth and most mens souls are as much concerned and more too then in hebrew and greek texts if the scripture were the onely way to life under his loving aspect so as to see they should not misse nor falsifie in a tittle though he would leave translators out of the lists of that loving aspect to erre and corrupt as much as they would for howbeit ken not the mystery of mind in this nor any reason why if god love his church and word he should not in his care to preserve both oversee with a loving aspect that translators should not as well as transcribers not mistranscribe yet allowes the loving aspect of god to transcribers but whether god himself do so or no dare not say denying that great favour as in which his church is much concerned as in the other to translators for
speaking of the chaldee paraphrase he sayes thus viz
seeing it hath not lain under any peculiar care and mercifull providence of god whether innumerable other faults be not get into it and errours not to be discovered by any varieties of copies as it is happened with the sepmagint who can tell no promise nor providence nor mercy nor loving aspect to the poor peoples scripture still which is that of translation onely for they cannot read hebrew and greek their part may go whither it will god looks not after it but such darlings do our doctors and clergy men deem themselves to be with god that his love care oversight promise providence and all is towards every tittle of their transcripts that they may trade with their text and mete out what they will to men for money from it should any qua make such mad conclusions their books would be good enough to be burned and thou wouldst iudge them no better

egregiam vero laudem spolia ampla refertis tuque liberque tuus magnum memorabile nomen

having foild the of that ragged rout the rest that have far lesse reason in them if lesse can be are soon routed
arg the second is the religious care of the church not of the romish synagogue sayst thou to whom these oracles of god were committed

rep what church then if not the remish synagogue hath had that commission of the scriptures to her and that religious care thou here talkst on to keep every tittle of the text entire without losse or change do not say that the now romane harlot hath now or ever had in her apostatical slate such a commission of the scripture to her as she pretends to as if they were the onely trustees to whose care and custody the text was committed of god for as to their proud prate and peculiar claim to such a preheminent power to be keepers and preservers of the scripture

deny it nay with thy self in the
pages of thy epistle
disown and damn their deceitfull pretence to such a trust reposed in them and if they had enjoy'd any such they have as thou sayest truly manifested a treacherous mind and falsified their trust egregiously and so cannot stand in judgement if called to account upon their own principles having indeed so far as they have had to do with the scriptures altered added detracted depraved vitiated interpolated and done what not to corrupt them during the long time of their dominus in whole christendom about scripture and every thing else ad extra that had any pretence toward the truth and while the scripture of the old but the new testament more specially seeing the iewes reject it lay lockt up from all the laity within the lines of her conclavical clerical conemunication for though de jure they ought not so to have impropriated it but were arrogant usurpers in so doing yet that de facto they had the grand custody of that ye call your canon and changed it as they pleased should judge thee more silly then am willing to do if thou shouldst deny it there being no visibly constituted christian church as to outward order in all europe that was other then a member of that blind babylonish body for at least a thousand years together

but if that church had not as say they had not canst thou tell me what church had the exact tale of so many books of the scripture as ye talk on and call your canon committed to her of god any more then they or if thou say the whole true apostolical church of christ under the gospel had that scripture we count the canon and no more committed to it where was there ever such a thing done by whom or when canst thou tell us any of this thou talkst on or give us any testimony of scripture for this or trusty tradition or any ground whereupon to act divine faith in this with thee so fundamental a matter save fiction of thy own fancy and thy own meer untrusty thoughts and blindly confident conjectures thou thinkst that in
tim

will serve thy turn in this case but have overturned that already and if ever there were such a divine commission of so many writings as a canon by christ or his apostles to the though abhor that paultry novelly pretended primacy of rome over other particulars yet while it remained in its primitive apostolical purity it had as deep a share as any other in that commission of the canon to her and so thy two questions ep
what scripture was this they say was committed to them and when was this deed of trust made unto them have full as much in them but that plane nibilest to answer thee withall as thou hast to answer me who of the church to whose care and custody thou sayest the scripture was committed since christ and by him or his apostles do here ask thee what church is that for thou amazest thy own and seek'st as priests do to stun other mens minds with the name of the church the church but what church is that whose care is said by thee to be so great whilst rome was so little to keep every tittle of the text entire and to whose care and custody it was to that end committed and intrusted and in thy own words to rome so to thee propound what scripture was this or where was this deed of trust made unto them

and since it was not the church of rome as freely agree with thee it was not what church was it or where liv'd it or by what name or title beside that generall blind name of church dost thou call it was it some one universal catholick visibly constituted true christian church that had such a constant clearly visible continuance and successive outward orderly being in a body as that romane harlot hath ever seemed to have from christ downward to this day was it your what should call it church that's run out from the womb of that babylonish bawd through the loines of your late fathers the prelates and scottish presbyters into that ragged patcht posture wherein it now stands like a participle that's neither this nor that nor noun substantive that can stand by it self without the magistrates help nor verb that betokens either doing or suffering any great matters for the truth but most like an adjective that leans upon parliaments and earthly powers to uphold it partaking with all sides as occasion is and of all formes something yet is just nothing but some participle or undefined span alphabet i.e vere nihil but a mongrel

was it this church that is one not individually but specifically the same with what yours is at this present derived downward and carefully receiving the scripture downward entirely in all its hebrew and greek letters accents points tittles and iota's without change or losse in the least is so shew us but some few footsteps of such a thing through the time of the catholike apostacy as a visible constituted church which might have been known by the distinction of elders bishops deacons in the dark dayes of romes dominion except that of rome it self that had the canon constituted of no more nor but just so many scriptures letters stories tittles iota's as thou trislingly tatlest by the apostles and so committed to their care and as carefully handed down to you linguists in every letter of the original languages without alteration addition or diminution

but more than suppose thou shalt as soon find and follow to a hairs breadth the very way of a bird flying or an arrow shot through the air as decypher such a matter and if the papists should put the question de novo to thee as they did long since to the protestants where was your church before luther if thou couldst prove the pedegree of thine so high as luther though witnesses to the truth more or lesse in all times suffering in sackcloth in the most dismall dayes own yet thou wouldst be as much puzled to prove any other constituted church that kept so entire as thou talkst thy constituted canon in all christendom beside that of the romish synagogue that corrupted it as that namelesse author was who wrote an answer to it entituled luthers predecessors who though he quits himself well in proving downward from iohn wicklisse who was well nigh
years afore luther but
after christ a company of particular successive sufferers for some truth that began to shine out again from under the romish smother yet can instance no higher then io wicklisse for at least a
years upward any thing at all but an universal dominion of the church of rome confessing that if the papists will tye him to prove any visible constituted church beside theirs before luther

the task is unequall because the records are wanting and also because the church was not in the long time of apostacy nor yet was to be alwaies in such a manner visible which is the very truth for the true church was to be and was according to the word of prophesie rev

and as when in her primitive glory she was cloathed with the sun and a crown of twelve stars on her head i.e the doctrine truth word of faith the apostles preached and not simply those few of their naked writings and letters and texts and their tittles and thou simply contendest on her head and the moon i.e all changeable things such as all texts and transcripts and tittles and iota are under her feet so when she came into her forlorn solitary state in the time which was while the whore or clergy began to ride the beast and fit upon the waters tongues nations kings and kindreds of the earth and to cry ecce duo gladii hic to claim both swords and to become supreamly as she made her or magistratical power that bore her up subordinately to her not onely custos utriusque tabulae of both tables but pretendedly custos utriusque testamenti chief commissioners trustees and keepers of both testaments when she was driven to and fro and chased like a roe or sheep and kept under and domineered over by the said mystical whore and hunted as well as by the heathen emperors in the first three hundred years or ten first persecutions she was in her several witnesses massacred murderd hang'd burnt headed fryed flead tortured in all the wayes that tyrants could invent though you that have no changes and therefore fear not god and sit at ease in your and are not shifted from vessel to vessel and so like moab have an ill sent settled in you can have time to talk to each other with your tongues and in your treatises about your texts in severall tongues and your letter in this language that and t'other yet the true church which but that the care and providence and presence of god was with her according to his promise full hardly kept and had much ado to keep the truth in the inward parts and her self from the outrages committed on her had other weightier matters to mind and look after and meddle with then the seeking out and looking up and keeping and preserving of such toyes as ye are now taken and wholly taken up with that is to say the integrity of the hebrew and greek texts the points vowels accents triviall tittles and iota and where thou find'st the spouses care according to a commission given her from god to be so extream as thou intimarest about these matters excepting in thy own nfinitely forging fancy no wise seeker shall ever find

thy third is the care of the first writers in giving out authentique copies of what they had received from god unto many which might be rules to the first transcribers

reply
cur as hominum from whence didst thou fetch this false and foolish piece of faith save from the old fathomlesse fountain of thy own fancy which if something as good as nothing may serve as easily

it may to fasten falsity upon fools will find something to say for every thing that it finds occasion to fain where readest thou that the first writers of every corner of thy so called canon which thou must adaequate thy proof to as well as to the whole or else thou syllogizest short of what thou aimest at took such care to give out authentick copies of what they wrote as from god unto many to is end that they might be rules to the first transcribers alas poor imagining man they that were ministers not of the letter but the spirit were not so full of care as ye are and as ye measuring the enlargednesse and copiousnesse of others by your straitned narrow selves conceive they were about such emptinesse as copies of what they wrote transcripts texts tittles points accents and such accidental stuffe as is not de esse to the kingdom and gospel of it which they published if any of them did as once paul did will that the colossians should let laodicea read what he wrote to them and read from laodicea what he wrote thither whether transcript or the original copy which might passe between two near who knows yet how many copies and to how many did he give out copies of what he wrote to particulars to be transcribed and kept and committed to the whole church of god as a rule for future transcribers and a rule of faith and obedience and such like to all ages of the world for ever his first to the corinthians and to ephesus and to laodicea for all his desire it should be read by the colossians happened to misse your bibles to be bound and bundled into which know it was no more intended then sundry others that are there which he wrote to particular and some private persons about private particular and personal affairs some wrote more generall epistles to all saints then in being as peter iude iames iohn and they might be but between might be and necessarily must be there's great difference as generally read as they could be where e're they came as being of more direct and general concernment to all as in that capacity of saints and some wrote more particularly as occasion was and they were moved by the spirit in which they did all that they did at all and not in the movings of the flesh letters to private persons about private matters as iohns short letter to gaius and pauls to philemon and timothy about the bringing of his cloak he left at troas with carpus but did either one or t'other of these give out authentick copies of these two private letters to many to be a rule to the first transcribers and rules to all saints to the worlds end tis true they are in your bibles among others that were got together and it pleases me well that they are there and should if you had all that ever the apostles and prophets wrote whereof if you have the
or
part its more then either you or or any man now knows and much it matters not for the certain knowledge of such an uncertain unprofitable thing but what of that will it follow that these about onestmus his being received into his master philemons service again and iohn telling gaius he would not write more to him now with pen and ink but hoped to see him shortly were ever intended by them to be the canon to the church of god in all ages which must be committed to the care of transcribers to be successively copied out to a tittle so that on supposition of any corruption or

change of a letter in the writing them over the eternall faith of god would cernally fall to the ground and the word of god not be preserved being lost as thou dotest much more if those whole letters or epistles themselves should be lost then actum est no other means of discovery nor recovery of the whole substantial truth but that would fail together with them must those be also submitted to so strictly that he that should not beleeve every external tittle of the text there transcribed to be the word of god as thou tellest us should be left inexcusable in his damnable unbelief and be in peril of eternal damnation and such danger as dreams and would draw all men into the dream of together with him

scilicet is superis labor est ea cura quietos sollicitat

as if the saints of old and they now that live at rest in god witness god dwelling in them of a truth had nothing to do but belabour and cumber one anothers minds as our wife clergy does who are wearied in the greatnesse of their way and are mole ruentes sua as suis ipsa a roma viribus ruit with continuall wrestlesness and as endless as easelesse care and thought of a tittle and such nugacyties as these that are in head piece whom here give to understand that while they like the tiberian massorites at their academies are so seriously doing of nothing and as childish in serious things yet nos nucibus facimus quaecunque relictis

arg thy fourth is the multiplying copies to such a number that twas impossible any should corrupt them all wilfully or by negligence
rep nugae why impossible to corrupt them all if not by wilfulnesse yet by negligence was it impossible that there should be variation in tittles and iota's which is corruption with thee in them all hast thou any more infallible security against the of them all then thou hast against the of some onely surely a man well in his wits would have argued thus it was possible to every individual of the copies to be through negligence or wilfulnesse or weaknesse and against the will or something of the transcribers none of them being any more then fallible as thou sayest
though never so honest therefore it was possible at least and not impossible but that they might be all and so corrupted

ver might be spoken of every individual copy as to its lyableness to ation caeteris paribus supposing all the remote transcribers to be but flible as well as some may be said of all the copies as well as of any one of them and if the ability of some transcribers might be greater then that of other some yet as thou sayest of the translators·
thou having no security of the principles or honesty of the ablests them for what thou knowest what ere thou thinkest they might be a'l as well as any one and however seeing thou veildest might be if all could not it would puzle thee not a little to to him that asks thee which is right and which wrong and in which possibly the transcribers might be mistaken and in which it was in ssible they should so and which do and which do not agree with the

none of which are left to correct it by there being no more then the apographa now remaining

but assuredly what mistake possible to befall my one of the copies was not impossible so befall every of them and so far art thou from denying it to be possible that some mistakes and viations might befall some copies for all thy peremptory pronouncing it impossible that variations should befall them all in regard of the number of copies that
upon that self same account of the multitude of transcriptions thou pronouncest it utterly impossible that all the transcriptions should be made without some variations and mistakes thy words there being these viz that so many
transcriptions most of them by private persons for private use having a standard of correction in the publike asselyes ready to relieve their mistakes should be made without some variation is undefined span alphabet or impossible ye ridiculous ringles round os that makes and runs in he complains of capellus
for asserting variations in all the undefined span alphabet or transcriptions of the old testament upon meerly uncertain conjectures yet upon as meerly uncertain conjectures himself asserts that they are not all corrupted yea he sayes a he thinks that its impossible there should be mistakes and variations in all the transcriptions and yet that it is impossible but that mistakes and variations should be in many of them

quis legat haec min tu istud ais quis non ni nemo

arg thy fifth is the preservation of the authentick copies frist in the iewish synagogues then in christian assemblies with reverence and diligence
rep what's all that in proof that there's no variation in copies of the hebrew and greek text in so as in tittles and iota's if thou couldst prove as thou dost onely propound it as thy opinion that authentick copies were kept with such reverence and diligence downward to this day in christian assemblies which christian assemblyes unlesse thou count upon those of the romish synagogue as such which onely remained in an outward way of assembling were not kept in the posture of constituted christian assemblyes themselves much lesse then authentick copies of the original text entire in them for a thousand years and upward but when they were in assemblies they rather each at their translated copies their severall mother tongues then at the hebrew and greek tittles and iota's that thou so openly tatlest for with such earnestnesse as if all divine truth as to our knowledge thereof did entirely and eternally depend upon them what dribling doings are here for a doctor arg thy sixth is the daily reading and studying of the world by all sorts of persons ever since its first writing rendring every alteration lyable to immediate observation and discovery and that all over the world

rep what's this to the purpose when was there more reading and studying the scripture by all sorts all the world over and tumbling to and fro to wearisomnesse by the scribes that never hear gods voice nor come to christ the light that they may have life and more close and curious prying and critical observing of the points and accents by syllabical and punctual schoolmen as at this very day in

their academical entercourses and interchangeable pro and con prate about punctations from one nation to another yet when more variety then now in the copies of their texts which the more they dive into the more discovery they make of the diversity of their transcripts but the matter is not mended for all that nor the multiplication of errours and various lections and mistakes of more then tittles in writings or printings and reprintings and why much reading study should be a means to prevent mistakes of old that's none now though more forcible then formerly if any efficacy were in it at all that way either have not reason enough to render the reason of it or rather there is no reason for it at all and that indeed is the very truth

arg thy seventh is the consideration of the many millions that looked on every tittle and letter in this book as their inberitance which for the whole world they would not be deprived of
rep what people be those that lookt on every tittle and letter in the bible as their inheritance which for the whole world they would not part with one tittle of for my part look upon them as ne'r the wiser for that if they were as many millions of millions as thou sayest there are millions of them for my part love the bible as much as do any book in the world and upon a true and just account and in a right way honour it as much as any man does himself not excepted for all his high unjust adorations of it and as for the holy truth thats declared in it have bought and paid so dear for that that no lesse then all that had in the world of what sort soever lust pleasure honour riches or righteousnesse of mine is gone for the sake of it and to have all that ever lost for it would not sell it again yet all the tittles and letters accents iota's and points which counts his such a rich possession
that are in all the hebrew bibles and greek testaments have and have more than one of each sort any one shall have of me for five pound and lesse money and the books themselves to boot and that is lesse then the whole world and yet shall hope to enjoy not a tittle the lesse of the word of truth that is therein told if sincerely attend to the light the letter calls to though should never neither buy nor so much as look into any outward copy of the original text more while live

and whereas sayes
somewhat sutably to what he sayes here that the church of god doth now and hath for many ages enjoyed the copies of the original languages as her chiefest treasure
say that is one of the chiefest untruths that have been told yet among those many that he hath treated out of that whole treasury of tales and va~in thoughts that are in his heart out of the abundance of which evil treasury his mouth speaketh and pen bringeth forth evil things for though the churches of mans constituting of which is yet a member and the ministers of mens making at the vniversities do now rejoyce in transcripts copies of the hebrew and greek texts and iota's and points and tittles and such like toyes and trappings and fruitlesse furniture as their chiefest treasure rich possession and inheritance which they glory and blesse themselves in for the whole world will not he deprived of knowing that they

must be deprived of all their worldly excellencies if they come once to part with them and do cry out undefined span alphabet that all truth tumbles to the ground if any jot and tittle of their original texts and hebrew punctation fail and they see no way to be delivered from utter uncertainty in and about all sacred truth ep
in such wise as the antichristian churches did in darker times behind us and do still in the dark places of their several habitations count old mouldy latine masse books and new moulded liturgies letanies and scottish directories meliori of a little better mould yet then the other two a thousand fold before the best of which yet prefer the scripture directory whether in its original transcripts or but translations their chief spiritual treasure crying out that all true faith worship church word of god religion and all is like to be utterly lost if these be taken away till the remove of which religion was never rightly found

yet the church of god which is now the some that it was in substance before any scripture at all was in rerum natura both ever did and doth still count christ the light and life of whom the letter onely testifies her chiefest ioy and treasure luk
joh and not the outward text that doth but talk of him much lesse the meer accidental adventitious parts thereof quae possunt vel adesse vel abesse sine scripturae interitu which as the whole scripture it self may be either present or absent from without the corruption of the substantial truth or word
but whose treasure the scripture is or is not it's little yea nothing to purpose to prove a transcription of the scripture we see and many millions more make much of and more ado about every tittle and lota of the text then they need do at this day and yet with a non obstante to all that the variety of lections are a thousand times twice told in transcripts and translations and if we will believe
frequent insinuations of an infinite number more are yet to be collected
arg the eighth as to the old testament in particular is the care of ezra and his companions in restoring the scripture to its purity when it had met with the greatest tryal that ever it underwent in this world considering the paucity of copies then extant

rep ezra and his companions care was as great no doubt as mans could well be in that case but ultra posse non est esse they could do no more then they could do as to the restoring the purity of the scripture when corrupted and that's questionable whether they restored it so perfectly as not to leave out some tittles or iota's yea and whole books too because they could not find them witnesse all those forenamed whole prophecies that are wanting but what if their endeavours had succeeded so as to set all to rights as perfectly and exactly to a tittle as twas at first giving our· might it not as likely and much more be corrupted vitiated altered in points tittles and iota's between ezraes dayes and now through the many tumbles catastrophes revolutions and greater changes of times and things then that of the babylonish captivity that have happened then in the dayes of its so long steady standing while it was reserved within the bounds and confines of

the iewish church onely and yet here thou intimatest it to have been then exceedingly charged depraved and defective or else how could ezra and his fellows be said to restore it to its purity thou art very hard put to it for a proof of the present integrity and purity of the hebrew text to a tittle that goest two thousand years backward asserting that it was restored to its purity then and thence concluding that it stands as entire to a tittle now as then it did thou mightst as well have gone a little higher and argued thus from before ezra viz the hebrew text was at first written by the holy penmen moses david isaiah and the other prophets truly and according to the mind of the spirit therefore it stands so entihe this day but thou seeing for all the iewes great care to keep it thou makest such an argument of it was much corrupted before ezra therefore beginnest thy account of its integrity to a tittle no higher then him in whose dayes thou deemest it was de novo most perfectly rectified ad amussim reckoning rashly as thou mostly dost and in no wise considering that thou hast no more but much lesse security against its alteration from ezra downward to this day not knowing what heedlesse hands of carelesse scribes it hath since come under then there was from ezra ards from the time of its most pure giying out in which juncture yet it so fell out that as that which they found of it in ezras dayes was by thy own confession much corrupted so not a little of was lost altogether but to knock this argument more fully on the head thy self confessest that as great as the care of ezra was to restore the text of the old testament to its purity and to compleat the points it hath since then slipt so far out of order that as to the points according to the iewes general faith it received a great reviving and restoration to their right and knowledge by the massorites when they had been much dis used quoting azarias in proof of it
and so hast routed thy own argument with thy own hands

arg thy ninth is this the care of the massorites from ezras dayes and downwards to keep perfect and give an account of every syllable in the scripture citing buxtorfius
rep here thou supposest thou puttest in sufficient security for its nonalteration in a tittle to this day but of the massorites care if doubt thy word and buxtorfs are not a ground to beget a divine faith in me or another about it who are bold in imposing your own conjectures but if own them to have been as carefull as thou conceivest them to be yet in the dayes of those before ezra who were as careful as these could be it came without losse much lesse is it likely it did to this day if those massorites before christ had been ten times more careful then they were forasmuch as thou rendrest both iewes and papists between which two sorts of men the hebrew text hath been reserved to this day both of them generations of men so hardned in hatred against the truth as not to be worthy to be counted faithful trustees about the scriptures besides as said to the argument last above thy self grantest the points so have been dis used so as to have been rectified by the tiberian massorite years since christ

arg thy tenth is the constant consent of all copies in the world so that on

sundry learned men have observed there is not in the whole mishna gemara or either talihud any one place of scripture found otherwise read then it is now in our copies

reply
what a piece of idem per idem is this wherein the self same thing that is to be proved is argumentatively urged in proof of it self the thing to be proved is that there is a constant consent in all the copies of the hebrew text in the world so that there is no copies read otherwise in any one place then ours or that do vary from ours in one letter apex tittle or iota to prove this the medium uses is this viz the constant consent of all copies in the world without any variation in any one place say here is not so good as ignotum per aeque ignotum but idem per idem the same proved by the same the thing affirmed evinced by affirming it ore again siccine putant academici nostrates many an acute academian would answer no otherwise to this bald businesse then by telling the doctor he is out and forgets what he hath in hand bidding him begin again but such a as dr featly sayes the are and such a rustick respondent as am must submit and take it as it comes without much talk lest be talkt with for it therefore shall do it so much honour as to put it up and to reply to it and so passe it by and passe on


if there be and have been such an universal constant consent of all copies in the world and not so much as one hebrew copy read otherwise then in ours in any one place of the bible for so large are thy words that thou art often fain to pinch them in again how is it that so many copies are with points and so many wholly without any punctation at all or if thou say all pointed copies are alike among themselves and all unpointed ones are alike among themselves how is it that thou to the contradicting thy self in this place confessest various readings in many other yet the very three next pages viz


are well nigh wholly spent in nothing but concessions confessions and acknowledgements that there are and have been various lections in the very old testament as well as the new and there thou grantest that some of those that are thou knowest no more of viz the various readings of the eastern and western iewes save that they first appeared it appears then there are some in bombergius his bible professing thy present ignorance of them and unwillingnesse for hasts sake to enquire after them yet wishing any that know ought of them to inform thee further but thou shouldst have informed thy self before thy rash and blind bold assertion and not say a thing positively and then say had wist and enquire when thou hast done whether it be so or no and moreover thou denyest not but that more various lections then yet thou knowest may be gathered out of ancient copies of credit and esteem and thou instances in particular in those called the keri and ketib which thou makest such a puzling of thy self about up and down in thy book that thou vainly spendest one whole chapter viz the last save one of thy second treatise to prove them to be of no moment which yet when all's done are varieties from the first manuscripts at least nemine contradicente though how they fell out at first none knows and thou guessest they were gathered by ezra
and

grantest that they are the face and appearance of various lections and that they are no lesse in number then
in the bible
and that thou art not able to satisfie thy self about the original and spring of all that variety that is in the bible by reason of them
and unlesse ye should suppose which yet thou seemest not to dare to do that the word was so received god as to make both necessary not knowing the true cause of this variety or difference between the scription which is in the love and the lection which is in the margin ye have nothing to blame but your own ignorance being not the onely case and confess thou speakest the truth in that wherein ye have reason so to do all which notwithstanding the consideration of this to keri and to ketib or vast and numerous variety of different scriptions and lections which are welny in thousands of words whereof some of them in the margin are supposed to have stood sometimes in the line being most groundedly conjectured to be no other then meer critical amendment of the iewes should together with the supposition and suspicion that is now begotten in the minds of many learned ones impeach that security which thou supposest at least thou hast of the mind of god truly represented to thee in thy crooked copyes and so a door be opened as it is already not more to curious pragmatical wits then plain honest truth telling downright dealing hearted light loving souls to overturn this ticklish foundation and all that thy simply supposed certainty of a true entire and to a tittle exact conformity of this hebrew text of scripture with that which was pen'd by immediate motion
and so seem to from the universality of this rash hasty assertion concerning the preservation of the original copies thereof to this hour in every point tittle and iota
thou bestirrest thy self what thou canst thorough the whole chapter aforesaid in vindication of the said universality and verity of thy arch assertion by diminishing this vast variation that is in the keri and ketib from the first manuscripts into a very little matter too vain to be at all counted upon as a various lection they are of so small weight and importance though must here tell thee
that of as small moment and importance as thou makest both these of keri and ketib as well as all the other varieties that thy self are sain to confesse to viz those of ben asher and ben nepthali those of the oriental and occidental iewes those called correctio scribarum or the amendment in places of some apiculi as thou diminutively stilest them to salve the credit of thy exquisitely crude expression of thy self often by the term of apices and every apex
and those called ablatio scribarum or a note of the redundancy of vau in five places thou that art tossed to and fro and yet thou seemest with the superstitious iewes to hold a copy to corrupted or prophaned if but one letter be but wanting or redundant sometimes viz
yet the least of all these are of weight and importance enough for all thy summary saying of them all together
they are varieties in things of lesse indeed of no importance to knock thy principal position on the head and howbeit thou sayest not in the least
in the least at least to impair the truth thy arch assertion that every tittle and letter of the outward text which thou till stilest the word of god remaines in the copies preserved by the

merciful providence of god for the use of his church to this day and must tell thee moreover that the more thou stirrest in defence of the universal verity of that thy unwarrantable and utterly untrue assertion the more it stinks and that rankly too not onely of unreasonable rashnesse and real falshood but also of a meer diotrephetically impudent and impositively prating spirit in thy self that rather then recant one rashly assented absurdity will run into a thousand to offer so peremptorily to persist int unlesse thou couldst speak more to the purpose then thou yet hast done or ever art like to do in proof thereof in that universality rigidity and strictnesse wherein thou statest it

and as to those of the keri and ketib in particular the utmost thou sayest in all that chapter wherein thou art wholly taken up about them whereby to refell the force of what falls heavily on thy arch assertion thence from by such as urge it to the evincing of variety of lections from the undefined span alphabet or primitive text is as strong as stubble it self to stand against it with and of no more force then foam and to resell it
for
thou sayest all the difference in these words that is the
words of the keri and ketib is in the consonants not at all in the vowels

rep
in which saying thou givest thy whole cause for if there be little lesse then a thousand words now in the hebrew text differing in the transcripts in their consonants from what they were as written in the first manuscripts what need any more to prove against thee that there are various lections and that in more then in tittles iota's vowels accents points and apices in the least of which yet if variation be proved it disproves the universality and verity of thy great assertion of identity to a tittle and what need the authors of that insinuation over whom thou crowest upon thy own dunghill and triumphest before thy time
produce the least testimony as thou falsly affirmest they cannot that there hath been in the world some copy of the bible differing mark thy words in the least from those we now enjoy or that those ye have are corrupted thou provest it against thy self to their hands yea that the consonants themselves are greater matters then points and apices and of more importance with thy self is intimated by thee
in the eye of any ordinary reader a yet thou thy self assertest
that
words are found different from what they were at first writing in no lesse then the very consonants what need we then any further witnesse since we our selves have so much confessed out of thy own mouth or rather extant under thy own hand and what need the authors of this insinuation prove their assertion in answer to thy confident universal challenge of them so to do
saying let them prove that there was ever in the world any other copy of the bible differing in any one word from those that we now enjoy tu dicis thy self sayest it that there are differences from the copies that were the inspi el authors and that of many sorts what say let them produce one testimony one author of credit iew or christian that can or doth did speak one word to this purpose let them direct us to any relike any monument any kind of remembrance of them and not put us off with weak

conjectures upon the signification of one or two words and it shall be of weight with us is it meet that a matter of so huge importance called into question by none but themselves should be cast and determined by their conjectures doth they think men will part with the possession of truth upon so easie terms that they will be cast from their inheritance by divination

bona verba quaeso possession of any thing that's counted an inheritance confesse is eleven points of twelve and they that are in it commonly count that truth and right is on their side right or wrong and the more ado and harder task they have who have to do with them to storm them out but as the case here stands it's no great matter sith the possessour fights for us against himself
art thou an author of credit thy self whose testimony may be taken for truth wilt thou believe thy self if not others confesse as thou sayest
of the romane harlot the common fate of lyars hath so befallen her for lying mostly in many things she professeth that she deserves not to be believed when she talks the truth
so may say of thee though believe thee when thou speakest truth yet thou utterest so many untruths that thou scarcely deservest to be believed when thou tellest the truth but yet if thou be of any credit with thy self and thou wilt but take thy own word then we are well enough and have wherewith to answer thy challenge having thy self in the self same book we have here to do with speaking more then one word at least and that's enough ad bominem to this purpose viz that there was in the world a copy of the bible different from what we now enjoy in one word at least and that's in more then tittles which thou who art callidus more then callidus in thy re frigida contendest for sith the keri and ketib those
words which are confest by thee to vary in their consonants from what they should be written with if what is in the margin were in the line are confest by thee not to have been so from the beginning which if not then there was once a copy different from what we now enjoy but of this thou wilt hear more from us by and by
secondly
thou sayest the difference in the sense taken in the whole context is upon the matter very little or none at all at least each word both that in the margin that in the line yield a sense agreeable to the analogy of faith
rep here thou mendest thy bad cause as well as one can well do that makes it worse then twas before for if there be welnigh a thousand words not onely different in consonants which is greater then that of tittles but also such as makes the least difference in the sense of the spirit which how many so e're the text may bear is acknowledged by all but your selves that make many to be but one alone ever to one word or place then thou thy self overturnest that certainty and identity of not onely the text it self thou so loudly contendest for but also in some measure of the truth it self contained therein which we say is eternally entire let the text run which way it will but thou here art forced to confesse that in the keri and ketib there's not onely a variation in words but also thereby in the very sense it self

and though thou wouldst fain mend it when thou hast done by mincing the matter making as if the context considered the difference in the

sense is upon the matter very little and agreeable either way to the analogy of faith as ye often speak whereby if not blinded ye might see how for all ye call the scripture your rule of faith yet ye more serne the scripture into the sense of a suitablenesse to your modern devised model of faith still then suit and model your faith according to the true sense of the spirit and mind of christ in the scripture yet that's a meer false seeth and gment of thy own for in some places there arises from the keri and ketib a very vast variety not to say clear contrariety in the sense such as if the context be consulted with is consistent with the faith but one way onely and not the other and sith thou puttest it to the tryall by the variety of those two words undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet which are the same in sound yet most distinct in their significations and so of all the varieties that are of this kind seeming to thee of the greatest importance of which it is observable that undefined span alphabet whose signification is is fourteen or fifteen times put in the text or line instead of undefined span alphabet whose signification is to him or it which is set in the margin am willing to be tryed by that very variety that is of thy own naming the better to satisfie thee

and whereas thou sayest that though these seem contrary one to the other yet wherever this falls out a sense agreeable to the analogy of faith ariseth fairly from either word instancing in some places picke out by thee for thy own purpose say if it do hold its not worth a pin or point to the proof of what thou sayest if in any one of those fourteen or fifteen places it appear to the contrary and that it does let me be so bold fith thou instancest in two that are fittest for thee to instance but one that makes against thee and then shall trouble my self no more with thy keri and ketib which would make one if not sick yet at least sorry for thee to see how sorrily thou shifts by it isa
thou hast multiplyed the nation not encreased the joy say the ketib or word in the text but the keri or word in the margin is undefined span alphabet to it which marginal reading though translators following the mistake of the keep to the ketib is undoubtedly the true and onely sense of the spirit for the reading in the line as it is in both transcripts and translation is considered with the context a piece of meer contradiction thou hast encreased the nation not encreased the ioy they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest as men rejoyce when they divide the spoil what a jarre does the word not encreased the ioy make in the sense of that verse yea it makes it meet confusion and contradiction to say the joy is not enlarged and yet it is enlarged like to that of men that rejoyce in harvest and at the dividing of the spoil but read it by the keri undefined span alphabet to it thus viz thou hast multiplyed the nation thou hast encreased joy to it or its joy they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest as men rejoyce when they divide the spoil and then there's no discord in the sound but its all sweetly sutable and harmonious and agreeable to the analogy of the true faith also

arg thy eleventh is the security we have that no mistakes were voluntarily or negligently brought into the text before the coming of our saviour who was to declare all things in that he not once reproves the iewes that account when yet for their false glosses on the word be spares them not
and

this argument is urged o're again interrogatively thus viz can it be once imagined that there should be at that time such notorious varieties in the copies of the scripture through the negligence of that church and yet afterword neither our saviour nor his apostles take the least notice of it yea doth not our saviour himself affirm of the word that was then among them scripture with thee that not undefined span alphabet should passe away or perish

rep
leave calling christ thy saviour as thou often dost till thou witnesse thy self saved by his grace from thy being a servant to sin as thou art so long as thou committest it or dost either undefined span alphabet or which is all one undefined span alphabet and commit it thou dost and must while thou livest while thou believest no perfect remission or full freedom from the commission of it in this life and must in the life to come too while thou believest no purging there neither for thy calling him thy saviour while thou art thus in thy sin is no more accepted of him then when thou callest him lord lord yet dost not the things that he sayes and that is as little as if thou saidst nothing

varieties and mistakes might befall the scriptures thy self elsewhere confessest
through the invincible infirmity of mens failings and fallibility in such a work as transcribing the best things and through meer weaknesse when through neither wilfulnesse nor negligence nor unfaithfulnesse and so passe as unreproved as they are in that case unreprovable

there might be mistakes of that nature through the scribes wilfulness and negligence perverting scripture and those reproved by christ too and his apostles also and thou ne'r the wiser there being many things truely that iesus did and spake that were never written in those histories of him ye have and that his apostles did and spake that are not written by luke in the acts nor in their epistles the which if they should be written every one the world it self would not be able to contain them among which that such a reproof was not one is more then thou knowest though thou wilt vent thy verdict very vainly ond positively still at a venture

if there were not one mistake or corruption through in the scripture before christs time hath there not been time enough for some sailing to fall out in it since that time which is years since in some one point apex accent tittle or iota what security hast thou against such a thing not knowing but as thou wilt be guessing and thinking what wicked careless and unskilful hands it hath since past under or rather knowing that by iewes and papists it hath been much vitiated

christ and his apostles in their often quoting scripture out of the old testament kept to the substance and sense of the words not alwayes to the text in totidem verbis verbatim or to a tittle isa
rom
rom
which shews that they minded the substance of the matter and not as ye do the empty figure of the outward letter in every trivial tittle point and iota of it


however do not understand this argument any more then thou that thou speakest on
christ reproved no such mistakes as

the scriptures through wilfulnesse or negligence years since therefore it is not in one point apex iot or tittle to this very day

arg thy twelfth is this viz after christ the watchfulnesse which the two nations of iewes and christians had alwaies upon one another with sundry things of like importance to this purpose which might he insisted upon
rep here's the rereward of the whole foregoing regiment and rout of red coat reasons that make a mighty shew a great way off as they lye all together in leagure against the truth so that one would take them as first glance to be of some great worth or weight to the matter in hand but when one beholds them nigher hand behold they are a parcell of ragged torn thred bare tatterdimallions that are scarce able well to stand on their legs they are so weak and wanting
and as for this last poor wretched miserable blind and naked argument that marches in the rear it is so lame and tired and decrepid and halts so pitifully after his fellows that it's in a manner pity to meddle with it for what importance soever judges it to be of see it's importance to be so little to his purpose as to evince every tittle of his transcribed text to be as true as at first writing that it can scarce well carry it self clear away much lesse import any great matter of danger or do any considerable execution toward the offending of the truth here defended or in defence and vindication of o's famously false assertion of the entirenesse of the outward text of the scripture to this day in every word letter consonant vowel point apex tittle and iota as twas at first given out by the hands of the inspired penmen of it that though more then need might soon be replyed against it yet shall say nothing to it at all but make it a passe and let it even go quietly again from whence it comes

chap
vi thus far as to o's twelve arguments the rest of his proof of the entirenesse of his text is made up of sundry sorts of considerations weak wottings and pidling putations all which kind of miscellaneous munition shall here give the reader an account of together with some such observations and animadversions as it's meet should be made thereof and then come to expostulate with about the whole case in hand and to set some of our surer grounded shall we thinks against silly shallow shall we thinks as he infers winds up his crazy conclusion withall and leave all that read them to their liberty to think of them what they please
such brittle businesses such starch straw and slubbly stuffe as stiffens and strengthens his strict assertion with a parte ante and his above named body of arguments for the certainty and infallibility of the right writing of every tittle and iota of the text of this day according to the first immediate writing thereof from god in both the old testament and the new is as followes


for the first transcribers of the original copies and those who in succeeding ages have done the like work from them whereby they have been propagated and continued down to us in a subserviency to the providence and promise of god we say not as is vainly charged by morinus and that they were all or any of them undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet infallible and divinely inspired so that it was impossible for in any thing to mistake

rep
if ye can't say that that they were infallible and divinely inspired in their work ye can say nothing at all that at all reaches your purpose or pretended proof of your so absolutely asserted certainty and infallibility of the entirenesse of your transcribed text and answerablenesse of it every tittle and iota to the original text of the penmen which answerablenesse if ye prove not and that infallibly too and by more then your own meer guesses and conjectures your universal positive assertion can apar to be no more then a supposition and then vobis ipsis consentibus your own selves acknowledging no lesse you have no sound assurance what ground ye stand on for the stresse of all sacred truth is by put upon the true transcription or of the greek and hebrew text which if not entire to a tittle and iota
upon any corruption supposed in the writing and that may very well not to say must be supposed if all the transcribers even the first as well as the latter cannot be supposed to be as infallibly guided in transcribing as the holy men were in the first writing there is no means of rectifying or recovering or of discovering or determining or judging of truth any other way and so thou givest upon a matter thy whole cause in granting the whole series of transcribers and race of writers to this day to be but fallibly guided and thy most perfect infallible stable and to a tittle true rule standard foundation falls all to the ground as a mere falible uncertain questionable basis to build so mighty a bulk upon as thou dost according to not others knowledge onely but also thy own acknowledgements and confessions

religious care and diligence in their work with a due reverence of him with whom they had to do is all we ascribe unto them
not to acknowledge these freely in them without clear and unquestionable evidence to the contrary is high uncharitablenesse impiety and ingratitude
this care and diligence we say in a subserviency to the promise and providence of god hath produced the effect contended for
nor is any thing further necessary thereunto
on this account to argue as some do from the miscarriages and mistakes of men their oscitancy and negligence in transcribing the old heathen authors homer aristotle tully we think it not tollerable in a christian or any one that hath the least sense of the nature and importance of the word or care of god towards his church shall we think that men who wrote out books wherein themselves and others were no more concerned then it is possible for men to be in the writings of the persons mentioned and others like them had as much reason to be careful and diligent in that they did as those who knew and considered that every letter and tittle that they were transcribing was part of the word of the great god wherein the eternal concerament of their own souls and the souls of others did lye
certainly whatever may be looked for from the religious care

and diligence of men lying under a loving and careful aspect from the promise and providence of god may be justly expected from them who undertook that work

rep of the loving and careful aspect and promise and providence of god and how little he stands by any promise engaged to preserve outward tittles as thou have spoken not a little before but if that were as true as thou sayest it is and as it is indeed most false that god were so engaged in order to the safe guarding his word and church to save every tittle of your priests transcribed texts does not his love and care of his word and church as strictly call for his careful aspect over the peoples translated texts and bind him in his providence according to the supposed promise to watch over and direct the translators in translating for the use of his church but few of which can read your original texts as well as the transcribers in transcribing which translators if they happen to be one the church that she must take some of her clergies words for infallible truth and as the sole foundation of her divine forth about the integrity of the text is out also and hath nothing but uncertainty it self even the uncertain fallible conjectures of spiritually unskilful scholars to trust to about the foundation of her salvation
neverthelesse thou wilt by no means allow that the translators lay under the same loving aspect who had as much to do with god and as religious a care and diligence in their work as transcribers had in theirs with a due reverence of him with whom they had to do yea not to acknowledge these freely in them which is the utmost thou darest ascribe to the others without clear and unquestionable evidence to the contrary is as high uncharitablenesse and ingratitude by how much their pains was the greater of the two as not to acknowledge the same in the transcribers the care and diligence of which said translators yet who must be supposed to be as much in a subserviency to that thy supposed promise and providence of god say hath no more produced the effect thou contendest for i.e the entire agreement of their copies to a tittle with the first originals thou that of the transcribers hath done which hath not produced the said effect so exactly as thou dreamest

it is enough to make a wise man wonder but that sapiens miratur because he expects no other then solly to proceed from the foolish wisemen of this world to see how thou settest thy transcribers up on high yet grantest them not to be infallibly guided of god neither who if he had no higher way to expresse his love to his word and church then by saving every tittle of thy transcripts from alteration or corruption could as easily have guided the transcribers infallibly as fallibly and more easily too since his spirit guides none fallibly so far as know and statest thy transcribers under the loving and careful aspect promise and providence of god in all they did in their work about thy greek and hebrew copies from whom yet no more may be expected justly then from translators in the undertaking of their work for translators did consider what every letter and tittle that they were translating was as well as transcribers did what every letter and tittle and iota was they were transcribing and to argue them to be as oscitant neglective and and mistaking as those that translated

heathen authors is as intolerable ad speak this for else own it tolerable enough so to argue of both transcribers and of scripture for such as transcribed and translated heathen authors and their work as well as they could and such as transcribed and translated scripture could do no more and were thy self confessing no more infallible nor infallibly guided then they onely a kind of care in them and in god over them which amounts not to his special spiritual guidance thou tellest say as intollerable as thou sillyly sayest it would be to argue from the and negligence miscarriages and mistakes of transcribers of heathen authors to the like in the scripture transcribers

but as for translators thou pullest them down and depressest them into a condition of as great carelesness and negligence and under as carelesse neglect of god toward them in their work as thou statedst the other in great care and diligence and under a careful aspect and providence of god towards them in theirs saying on this wise
of translators viz the translators own indivertency negligence ignorance for the wisest seenetial is one among other reasons to be assigned of their variations from the original as if there were neither inadvertency negligence nor ignorance in transcribers but they without being undefined span alphabet were so wise as to see all and had nothing but all diligence and no such weaknesses translators had
and again
of the syriak translation on this wise it was made get know neither when nor by whom in sundry places following another corrupt translation having passed through the hands of men ignorant thou knowest who they were yet callest them ignorant and suspicious against whose frauds and folly ye have no relief and thou questionest whether it may be esteemed of any great use or importance as to the end enquired after as if the self same might not be said of thy transcription as if thou knewest exactly when and by whom they were made and that they followed corrupt copies in any places but all pure ones and were known to thee to have past thorough the hands of men neither ignorant nor suspicious as thou hadst all the relief and in the world of all thy transcribers integrity and honesty from ezra and from christ to this very day and that they were men that had neither fraud nor holly whereas most if not all of the hebrew copies have been made by the iewes against whom when thy turn in any point so to do thou talkest as if there were nothing in the world but iniquity and as to the scriptures fraud and jolly felt in the very of them and as if it were not to be questioned but that al the copier that thou are pleased to esteem and no other were to be esteemed of so great as to be canonized as the to the whole world which is the end of the transcribed copies of the originals now enquired after

and again of the chaldee paraphrase this viz seeing it hath under any peculiar care and merciful providence of god whether innumerable faults and as it happened with the may not be got into it who can tell as if thou couldst tell what and which transcriptions and translations have lain under that thy so on loving aspect peculiar

care and merciful providence of god so as to be exempted from faults and besides the primitive copies and which have not who told thee but thy own rambling roving and conjectural fancy that these have and those have not yet beu quam praecoci ingenie how hastily dost thou both take and give it out for granted here that such namely the chaldee paraphrase and the septuagint translations god had no regard to help the translators in and as for some and those sundry transcriptions too of original copies when they like thee not and are such as are not concordane with thy favour'd darlings how dost thou set them at thy heels

as corrupt novell transcripts though of two or three hundred years or elder and as consonant for ought thou knowest by any thing but tradition to the undefined span alphabet which are not now in the world for thee or any to correct or try by as some thou so much settest by but the vulgar copy ye use thou callest by tradition onely received from thy forefathers and so upon no truely divine but humane account if it be the truth the publike possession of many generations and that which upon the invention of the art of printing was in actual authority throughout the world with them that used and understood that language an implicitly confident broad blind bold speech yet like thy self as far as any thing appears to the contrary that was well put in however if thou hadst added to at the end of it yea this thou very imperiously and impositively givest the word of command for the canonizing and authorizing of saying let that passe then for the standard which is confessedly in foro privatae tuae phantasiae saltum its right and due

thus king of babylon among men so majestically behaves himself among the many transcribed and translated copies of the scripture authorizing and franchising which he pleases and as the other with persons so with patterns of the text patronizes as he lifts dan
which he will he slayes which he will he keeps alive which he will he sets up and which he will he puts down and if he be askt why this and not that is under gods careful aspect stat pro ratione voluntas


and whereas thou sayest that the transcribers care and diligence in subserviency to gods promise and providence hath produced that effect thou contendest for viz the entirenesse of the text to a tittle at twas at first dost thou not say this as thou dost twenty things more meerly on thy own head and if that have produced that effect why doth not the same cause produce the same effect in all transcribers as well as such onely whose work thou settest the crown on and in translators as well as transcribers seeing thou hast no more security of the ability faithfulnesse honesty care and diligence of such whose transcriptions thou talkest up then of such whose transcribed and translated copies thou talkest down as altered varying from the first originals and apparently corrupt neither canst thou charge the one more then can the other justly though unjustly thou wilt be doing so with inadvertency carelesness and negligence they being all alike unknown to each of us yet thou ownest the transcriptions of some such as spurious by superfluity and redundancy of unnecessary and deficiency of necessary words as corrupt
and such like all which proves against thee variety in copies too but that thou wilt not see it in points tittles

and iota's at least which variety if any at all cannot be in lesse matters then these


and though thou sayest not any thing further then the said religions care and diligence of scribes is necessary to the said effect of identity with the first copy to every iota and tittle without infallible guidance from gods spirit dost thou say that in earnest if thou dost say in earnest thou well knowest not what thou sayest for let there be never so much honesty fidelity care and diligence used yet unlesse there be an infallible guidance or writing by that immediate inspiration which thou ascribest to the holy penmen but denyest and darest nor ascribe to thy first transcribers the mind and will of god if be to be believed when he speaks against himself is not represented to thee as thou sayest it is
without the least interveniency of such mediums and waies as were capable to give change or alteration to the least iota or syllable without the least mixture or interveniency of any medium obnoxious to fallibility as thou sayest it is
for in the very next words
thou utterest enough to the confutation of thy self in this while according to thy wonted manner of running round as one borrendo percussus scotomate thou sayest the wisdom truth integrity knowledge and memory of the best of all men is obnoxious to fallibility and consequently say capable to give change in the most careful transcription that can be made by mans hands that is uninspired in much more then the least iota or syllable thus art thou contrary to thy self still


but say for all thy reasonlesse rounds and self contradictory conceits more then transcribers care and diligence is necessary thereunto i.e to the producing of copies infallibly conformable in every tittle iota and point to those of the first penmen and to the begetting of the divine faith which is more then meer humane fallible perswasion that thou oughst to have about the soundnesse universal incorruption certainty integrity invariablenesse and infallibility of that thou callest thy foundation even that immediate manutenentia dei or undeceivable direction and divine inspiration of god which if it be wanting as thou confessest it was from the first to the last of thy transcribers such is the weaknesse of men where never so much carefulnesse is in transcribing of books that there may be miscarriages and mistakes which if there be in the least iota or syllable it's great enough to lay thy universal grand assertion to the ground and all thy proof of it from the foresaid care and diligence will prove not worth a pin to thy purpose
but alas what do talk of weaknesse where either the leading of the spirit of god is wanting or a willingnesse in men to be led by the holy spirit as it is in all that assert as thou dost his infallible guidance to be gone out of the world in these dayes there's not onely much weaknesse to such a weighty work as thou makest the transcribing the scripture to be but as thou sayest
so in this case about the scriptures so much vanity foolishnesse falsenesse unfaithfulnesse negligence ignorance and sloth love of money for which many write at others appointment being well paid for their plains more then of the matters they are writing as well in scribes as printers of the very scripture it self carelesnesse adding detracting unsuitablenesse of their spirits and minds to spiritual things losse of all remembrance of what they are and

what they do that can give very little credit to what have nothing but the authority ability integrity wisdom knowledge truth memory care and diligence of such to rely upon for without evidence of their being divinely and infallibly guided which guidance thou denyest to thy scribes nor can any wise man groundedly believe any other but that the books of scripture passing through the hands of many such transcribers have upon them the marks of their neglects ignorance and sloth and have had as hard of belief as thou seemest to be of this
the fate of other books

yea let me but ask thee this is that faith thou hast that thy greek and hebrew copies are to a tittle so uncorrupted as thou contendest a divine faith or a fallible perswasion onely if the latter it's not worth a figge if thou have no bettr faith then so and art not more infallibly assured then so of the infallibility of that which thou callest thy most perfect rule and infallible foundation if the former what is it must beget this divine faith in this thing that there's not a point nor tittle varying in thy now canon standard or adored copy from the first copy of the text that ever was will thy vain confidence hopes conjectures good conceits of thou knowest not what scribes that wrote thou knowest not when give thee such a faith or the traditions and authority and testimony of honest men saying so and so downward for many generations or some infallible ground of certainty that they were guided to write every word by divine inspiration not the first for thou utterly disclaimest that as no ground of divine faith about the scriptures by saying thus
if numbers of men may be allowed to speak we may have a traditional testimony given to the blasphemous figments of the alcoran
but the constant tradition of more then a thousand years carried on by innumerable multitudes of men great wise and sober from one generation to another doth but set open the gates of hell for the mahometans and thus
though should grant that the apostles and penmen of the scripture were persons of the greatest industry honesty integrity faithfulnesse holinesse that ever lived in the world as they were and that they wrote nothing but what themselves had assurance of as what men by their senses of seeing and hearing are able to attain yet such a knowledge and assurance is not a sufficient foundation for the faith of the church of god if they received not every word by inspiration and that evidencing it self unto us otherwise then by the authority of their integrity it can be no foundation for us to build our faith upon
not the latter for thou disclaimest that and darest not ascribe any such thing as infallible guidance or divine inspiration to thy trustee transcribers so where the divine faith about the firmnesse of thy foundation it self stands founded and bottom'd unlesse it be in the bottomlesse pit it self of thy own fancy he must have more rope to fathom with then have that will ever find

wilt thou not then say of the first transcribers of the scriptures that the were infallible and divinely inspired do not say thou dost ill in refusing so to say nay rather thou dost very well and somewhat honestly and ingenuously in that for indeed we cannot tell nor say safely that they were so but art thou then freely willing in very deed to yeild it to

us that they were fallible and that twas not impossible for them to mistake this grant of thine we are as free to accept of as thou art to give it and make good use of it too not so much against as for thy self viz to shew and instruct thee from thence that there's rottennesse at the very root of all your religion and a fearful flaw of fallibility that is in the very foundation of your faith and believing in which thou sayest ye are built on the writings of the prophets and apostles
that so ye may which is the worst that we wish you come to be better built on a firmer foundation and both you and your foundation and faith and all may stand fast and never as now ye must do fall any more from thenceforth for ever even the foundation of the apostles and prophets it self which was not their writings for these were not their foundation nor were given to be ours for if they were then they had been built upon themselves and we are to be upon them which is absurd to say for neither their own preachings nor writings were their own foundation which they were built on nor are we to build onely upon them but both they and we upon that which all holy men were built on from the beginning before any writing was at all viz christ iesus the light the corner stone which the blind builders refuse on whom whoever builds and believes if he never come to read one tittle of any outward writing shall assuredly never be ashamed

in this one grant then thou hast given both the qua and all others thou contendest with no lesse then the very cause thou contendest for viz that the scripture or letter is infallibly the infallible word of god and every letter tittle and iota of it also one iot or tittle of which can no sooner fail then heaven and earth can passe away and that every iota and tittle that was in the outward letter as at first given forth from god by inspiration is preserved to this very day without corruption and remains in the copies preserved till now for the use of his church that the whole scripture entire as given out from god without any losse is preserved in the original copies yet remaining yea in them all is every letter and tittle for this is the cause thou hast taken in hand in which thou wilt find when once thou awakest that thou hast hold on the wrong end of the staffe and these and much more of the like sort are thy own words and absolute assertions about it up and down in thy book






which if they cannot be made good so high thou runnest but that there be any corruption to be supposed in your present original copies and various lections though it be granted by capellus and others that the saving doctrine remaines sound as to matters of moment yet this shall not satisfie nor afford thee relief enough but thou wilt needs give up all thy cause as lost even further then thy own opponents would have thee confessing and professing that all your doctrine is corrupt not continuing entire no means of its discovery nor of its recovery from a lost condition no means of rectifying it or determining any thing about it see


yea so as to yeild your selves to be at such a losse as not to know what ground ye stand on yea in thy dedicatory epistle pag
lay but these two together first that the points are the invention of the tiberian massorites which by all thy proofs to the contrary thou leavest as uncertain

as thou foundst it and little lesse then yeild'st that it's but uncertain that its lawful to gather various lections and then sayest thou for my part must needs cry out undefined span alphabet tell me where must stand as not seeing any means of being delivered from utter uncertainty in and about all sacred truth and so thou goest on desuing to be instructed by such as see through the that are likely to ensue on these principles as one that tremblest to think what will be the desperate consequences of imagining alterations in the points tittles and iotaes of your originals ep ded
now what the issue will be we leave to god though some know it yet thou are too weak to bear the sense of it without amazement being bottomed no better then upon a quavering bogge if it should be told thee yet know it thou wilt when it comes to passe or if thou canst bear it take it now
fiat justuis aut pereat mundus the issue as dreadfull as it seems to thee who in fearlesse dangers of greater mischiefs and but dangerless fears of this present object thou so startlest at will assuredly be no worse then this as said above viz that while theeves will fall out true men will come by their good again if all the divines in the world be in such digladiations as to draw their daggers against each other about it yet the light from which your whole letter came will be turned to when the letter is found to be but a fallible uncertain rule as falsified by mens and which light is certo certius vera verius if ought can be so even no lesse then infallibility and certainty it self and that very equity and truth it self which the letter teaches and doth but tend to and for my part sink thou and thy fearful fellows boreling priests and wrangling lawyers that live altogether on mens lusts trespasses and sins of which when the world comes to the light and by it to be led into love honesty and peace as there will be no need so it will be wiser then to be fooled into a feeding of you for feeding them in their fightings say sink ye whether ye will and your quick sandy foundadations together with you till both your selves and them be swallowed up by that greater glory of the light it self now arising again upon the world though they will nor see it know some that stand so fast in this juncture wherein the old heaven and earth shakes in order to its removing as to see thousands fall besides them and thousands at their right hand yet be out of fear of the fearful fall of the hypocrites coming nigh them and as it hath never repented me hitherto to see that people that were priestbewildred and hampered in latine letanies english liturgies divine scottish directoryes falling off from their priests and scribes to the search of scriptures so it will never repent either my self or many thousands more that are turned to a true attendance to the light of christ having witnessed that weaknesse of the letter it self to save the soules of men which the letter it self also bears witnesse to rom
to see men fall according to the councel of the scripture in that behalf gal

such a tall is in truth not from but to the scriptures from the scripture it self to the holy spirit

neverthelesse were one that did close never so cordially with thee in thy cause about the scripture yet could not commend but most condemne the course in which thou commend'st it to us for as if it were

not forward enough te fall of it self thou hastenest to handle it down with thy own hand writing while thou grantest the very first transcribers of the scripture to be fallible and also to have erred and failed though it were but in points tittles and iotaes and in no lesse they could fail if they fail'd at all for is they were fallible and what they wrote were falsified in the least then at least thy foundation which is no other then such transcriptions is so far false and fallible as they failed and so contrary to what thou sayest in the least at least it impairs the truth of thy archassertion that the whole scripture and every tittle and letter as given out from god without any losse is preserved and remains entire and without corruption in the copies of the originals yet remaining for sure one tittle letter or iota a thousand to one may if they mistook at all be either wanting or redundant and if they fail'd who wrote immediately out of that which was first written by inspiration then those that transcribed downwards from that day to this having none but imperfect copies to write by might likely fail so as to make them more rather then lesse imperfect for error minimus in principio is ever major in medio maximus in fine if the first or second stone stand never so little awry in any building following that it will swerve into more and more crookednesse towards the top and so what corruptions crookednesse alteration ablations additions variations from each other in more then tittles and iotaes there may be now in the copies ye have there being now no autographaes to amend them by but a bottomlesse pit and endlesse heap of uncertain conjectures contradictions scoldings and scottlings among the scribes about it pro and con some saying one thing some another and the most part they know not what themselves but as they think and hear from others who knows save confident who seldom looks before he leaps and so knocks the nail on the head as to hush all the hurries that are about it and end the controversie and put it out of all doubt so far as his helplesse hammer will do it by first saying positively there is no variation at all and secondly proving it so to be as infallibly as his fallible conceits can prove so ambiguous a businesse by saying from more uncertain grounds then his seniors and superiors viz
doctor iohn prideaux as he was called luther capellus and others say the contrary that he cannot but conjecture it so to be which proof hath as much strength in it as a straw while thou confessest as thou dost that religious care and diligence in their work with a due reverence of him with whom they had to do is all ye ascribe to the first transcribers which not to acknowledge in them is high vncharitablenesse which care they lying under a loving careful aspect from god together with the promise of god where he promiseth no such matter as thou talkest on viz to preserve the letter in all its transcriptions from any alteration but to put his word into his peoples mouths and his providence and care of his church to which yet or to the transcribers of that which was to be her only rule as thou sayest thou deniest that he yielded his infallible spirit to continue with them ever as their guide produces the copies yet extant and then inferrest thy conclusion to this purpose viz
shall we think that men that knew that every letter and tittle they were transcribing was part of the word of the great god should

should not be more careful and diligent in their work then such as transcribed heathen authors homer aristotle tully thus to argue we think is not tollerable in a christian and to imagine that the same fate hath attended the scripture in its transcription as hath done other books which yet find some learned men too free in granting seems to me to border on atheism say while thou sayest but thus thou sayest no more then what deserves no other answer then this viz
that to say confesse and grant that the first transcribers of the scripture were not infallible nor divinely inspired but fallible and to ascribe no more to them then a religious care and diligence in their work and due reverence of god with whom they had to do and their lying under a loving and careful aspect from a promise of god which was never made infallibly to guide them and his providence without his divine inspiration and direction and yet to conclude that their transcriptions were not attended with the same fate as other books viz aristotle tully whose transcribers out of the reverence they had of those authors or whoever else engaged them in that work would be as careful and diligent as they could without doubt and no men uninspired can be more and much more that in their transcriptions it must not be supposed there was any corruption or variation from the first copies so much as in one letter or tittle in the copies extant at this day as sayes seems to me and appeal to all men that are well in their wits to judge of what say such an odde kind of such a parcht up parcel of confusion such an inconsequent conclusion as is no lesse but somewhat more then atheistical having not only nothing in it of either god christ or the christian but even not the common reason of a man and so is intollerable both among christian men and others and bordering upon atheism as all unreasonablenesse doth yea
doubt not as full of oscitancy and negligence as thou wast in the framing of the fabrick of thy book it self yet the reverence and respect to thy doctorship and such like would oblige the printers of it to as much care and diligence in the doing of it as they can use at this day who print the bible it self neverthelesse what miscarriages and mistakes and what a multitude of errataes as there are many printers faults in this of mine are at each end of thy two english and latine tractates and is transcription by the pen more exempted from errataes then the presse which sometimes produces such abominable errours in the bible it self as would amaze some people that know not the mystery of that art to be liable to mistakes about the scripturess as well as in other writings to read the flat falsities that have been the issue of their failings yea the same fate hath attended the scripture at the presse as hath other authors and why it cannot at the pen cannot conjecture to instance in one that is more grosse then others ordinarily are rom

in one edition impression that have seen these words of paul viz from ierusalem to illyricum have fully preached the gospel are misprinted thus from ierusalem and round about to illyricum have falsly preached the gospel of christ so that for thee to say the fate in transcriptions and impressions in which way the scriptures now altogether come forth since printing came up for there's now little or no writing thereof at all hath not attended the scriptures as hath other books

vox sonat haecce deum ne hominem sonat hac tua ceri

as for the rest of those yielding strawes and weak weapons wherewith thou standest out pushing and warring on in vindication of thy assertion which looses ground more and more at the tayl of which thou again usherest in thy conclusion viz
the iewes silly superstitious sayings and doings which thou minglest with thy own shall we thinks as if thou didst not only justifie and side with them in their absurdities but also build much as to the evincing of thy position thereupon there lacks little to be replyed as to the routing of them every one that hath any little solidity in him being easily capable to see and feel the foppicalnesse thereof yet at least shall do thee so much right who perhaps placest more in them then many a wise man would do as to nominate them

the iewes sayest thou pag
have a common saying that to alter one letter of the law is no lesse sin then to set the whole world on fire the truth is they are prodigious things that are related of the exact diligence and reverential care of the antient jewes in this work ben asher spent many years in the careful exact writing out of the bible let any consider the things which they affirm to prophane a book or copy one is if but one letter be wanting and another if but one letter be redundant and shall we think that is writing it they took no more care then a man would do in writing out aristotle or plato considering that the word to be transcribed was every tittle and iota of it the word of the great god that if any failings were made innumerable eyes of men owning their eternal concernment to lye in that word were open upon it to discover it
it is no hard work to prove their care and diligence to have that of common scribes of heathen authors even among the heathen we will scarce think that the roman pontifices going solemnly to transcribe sybills verses would do it either negligently or treacherously or alter one tittle from what they found written and shall we entertain such thoughts of them that knew they had to do with the living god in and about that which is dearer to him then all the world besides let men then clamour as they please and cry out of all as ignorant and stupid which will not grant the corruptions of the old testament they plead let them propose their conjectures of mistakes crept into the original copies with their remedies as capellus we shall acknowledge nothing of this nature but what they can prove by undeniable and irrefragable instances which as to any thing done by them appears upon the matter to be nothing at all
it can then with no colour of probability be asserted which yet find some learned men too free in granting namely that there hath the same face attended the scripture in its transcription as hath done other books let me say without offence this imagination seems to the to border on atheism surely the promise of god for the preservation of his word with his love and care of his church of whose faith and obedience the word is the only rule require other thoughts at our hands
we adde that the whole scripture entire as given out from god without any losse is preserved in the copies of the originals yet remaining what varieties there are among the copies themselves shall be afterwards declared in them all we say is every letter and tittle of the word

reply
because the children of the letter of the old testament nor

of the gospel the spirit and the new are so sortish and senslesse as to surmise that the bare copies of the letters and points and tittles and are dearer to god then all the world besides so that its a greater sin to one letter by either alteration ablation or addition which change by deficiency or redundancy may befal the most critical curious careful scribe that ever was does prophan a copy so that its not the holy scripture for prophane and holy are undefined span alphabet and is as great a sin and a matter of as much moment as the the whole world and upon such uncircumcised conceits are men exact and diligent to very and careful of pins points vowels accents tittles iotaes apices and letters of the text ad extra not tantamount to the least of the truths therein contained no not to so as tyth while the law for it stood of mint and commin to utter carelesnesse of the grand truths and reverentially respectful to their book as they were of old to their brazen serpent of as divine original and to as divine an end as the letter is to very idolatry and spending their time in tedious transcribings of every apex to the very total loss of many years from the more weighty matters of judgement mercy righteousnesse faith and truth which the text doth but testifie of and prodigious to very superstition say because that blinded generation of men viz the iewes whom sometimes thou seemest to tax for their undue veneration of the letter and of it pag
and to set them at nought as men feeding themselves all their dayes with vain fables addicted to figments profoundly ignorant idolatrous full of foolish contradictious triflings bewitched with their dunghilly traditions doing how seriously of nothing how childishly in serious things fools sots froth smoke nothing whose sayings and doings are no more to be heeded then that of wick'd blind madmen pag
do so adore the letter and dote on the tittles of it must thou needs be foolish and doting and sottish and superstitious and idolatrous and so childishly serious in taking up thy time and thoughts so totally and piningly after toyes and trifles and iots and tittles together with them vin tu curtis judaeis oppedere wilt thou sometimes flert at the iewes fancies and fopperies and odde conceits and carriages of themselves in boyes toyes and at that which is the fruit of their fidling minds as not fit to be any other then forgotten and yet forget thy self so other whiles as to entertain their vain thoughts so as to own them as thine own and own them as thy grounds and foundations to frame thy arguments upon so as both think the same with them and from thence to impose upon the thoughts and faith of others for if thou judg them ridiculous why dost thou alledge them in so serious a case as thou dost and if thou justifie them art thou not one with them and because thou think'st as they so superstitiously think and from thence thrusts out thy confident conclusions in that thy wonted interrogative way of shall we think this and that shall we entertain such thoughts can it be imagined or if positively then thus it is not unprobable it can with no colour of probability be asserted this or that imagination seems to me to border on atheism gods promise require other thoughts at our hands and such like must therefore the children

and ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit run a whoring with the dead literatists back again from the spirit to the letter from the son to the servant from the substantial word to the image and copy of it from the living to the dead from the eternal inalterable incorruptible truth to the varying vanishing perishing tittles of greek and hebrew external texts must they that are of the light and of the day think and dote and dream with the doctors of the night and of the darknesse

and because i.o those rabbies and textmen and thou with them think so yet shall we think that every tittle and iota is the word of the great god and that our eternal concernment lyes in every outward apex of thy canonized copy and that such an accidental attome is dearer to god then the world besides and that every copy of the holy scripture is prophane if redundant or deficient from what at first writing it was in one letter and that tis more to mistake so as to alter a letter in transcribing a copy of the law then to burn the whole world shall we think that the writers of aristotle plato would not for money or for their credits sake or something as most scriveners do in what they undertake transcribe as exactly as they could and shall we think that men uninspired as thou confessest the scripture transcribers were could possibly do any more then they could do

yet to entertain the best thoughts of them that may be grant their care and diligence to be more then that of common scribes of heathen authors to save thee the pains of proving it and that minori ad majus as the romans would not treacherously sybills verses so much lesse would iewes the scriptures having therein to do with god yet shall we think all that transcribed scripture translated it too knew not whom they had to do with as well as some yet varieties thou here confessest are in the copies among themselves and that cannot be but that some of them must differ from the first original and if at all in tittles at least and if but so its enough to the universality of thy assertion and so what was possible to some as mistakes were was possible to all and not impossible to any transcribers shall we think then because thou so thinkest that there are no mistakes crept into the original copies upon they groundlesse conjecture that if it be so that any be all truth it self fails as to its certainty and that without remedy or relief though sufficiently propounded by capellus and others to the satisfaction of any save wild i.o thats resolved to hold the conclusion and is loath to abate of his once uttered rash assertion but as it is forced from him by degrees professing that he will acknowledge nothing of this nature but what is proved by undeniable and irrefragable instances which instances also himself gives and though he would have others give heed to his own improbable probabilities yet is adeo infeliciter stupidus ut nulla ratione neque experentia erudiri possit quasi tamen ipse solus superer vana perswasione sideratus in contemptu omnium audaciter persistit cum comico illo clamans dicat quod quisque volet ex opinione non dimovebimur

so unhappily irrefragably stupid himself as not by any reason or experience to be instructed but as if he alone must impose possest it with a vain perswasion pertinaciously proceeds in contempt of all men crying out with the comedian let every one say what he will we will never be removed from this opinion for if the testimony of his seniors capellus i.p or experience it self were of any weight or moment he would blush to deny that there are various lections and transcriptions of the scripture

shall we think because i.o so speakes he thinks that it can with no colour of probability be asserted though learned men as is confest do confesse it that the same fate hath attended the scripture in its transcription as hath done other books shall we think because i.o saith it so seems to him that so to imagine and so on deliberation to assert borders on atheism shall we think and conclude because i.o concludes so in his thoughts that the whole scripture entire as given out from god even every letter and tittle without any losse is preserved in the copies of the originals yet remaining shall we think because i.o without the least colour of sense reason certainty or probability thinks so that the promise of god for the preservation of his word and his love and care of his church fails utterly if one iot or one tittle of the outward text fails so as to be mistaken in the transcribing surely if so it fails as much through the failings that are in translations not without his permission for his word and church as to her knowledge of it if the letter were the only way to know it now are as much concern'd in the right translation as transcription yet i.o denies that god vouchsafes his infallible guidance in either but surely the promise of god for the preservation of his word with his care of his church of whose faith and obedience not the letter or writing of it but the word it self declared of therein is the rule and was so before the letter was the preservation of which is neither more nor lesse by the letters being or not being requires other thoughts at our hands

now as for what follows that above named crue or brigade of arguments that were crowded so close together for as to what have spoken to last it was but a kind of carelesse forlorn hope that past afore them its mostly made up of a stragling number of grants concessions confessions allowances acknowledgments and yieldings up of the case in hand or the cause it self by i.o so much before contended for howbeit so as that i.o gives the world to know such is as he sayes truly pag
of

others and himself too the vanity curiosity pride and naughtinesse of the heart of man and his readinesse to please himself with his own thoughts of things having once published them as evidences of his learning and diligence and so exceedingly curious uncertain is the mind of man as i.o also de quo fabula narratur sayes epist pag
after a door to reputation and renown by learning is opened in the world that having once spread himself in his expressions over all bounds and limits of sobriety rather then deny himself downrighthly so as to expose himself obvious to all as one that hath been ignorant and that he may render the ridiculousnesse of his lost labours as remote as may be from the observation of the many let the fruit and issue be what it will he will seem to own and stand to them to the utmost apex as long as possible he can that he doth not resign up the truth of his arch assertion but upon honourable terms and with certain limitations restrictions distinctions reserves to himself and upon articles and grants back again to him from his antagonists as though they help not much to heal and cure his cause from sinking yet shall serve at least as drums beating trumpets sounding colours flying bullet i'th mouth bag and baggage use to do to keep up the credit of conquered to salve the credit and reputation of the wrestling rabbi

the said grants are on this wife viz
though the point at first propounded positively and treated and insisted on very earnestly to be proved was that the undefined span alphabet or copies which we have do contain every iota that was in the undefined span alphabet or first writing both of moses and the prophets and also of the apostles and evangelists pag
yea every letter and tittle of the old testament without corruption and entire without various lections pag
and what is spoken thus of the old testament must be affirmed also quoth i.o of the new
and pag
the scripture of the old and new testament are preserved unto us entire to the least iota or syllable in the original languages and pag
that the whole scripture entire as given out without any losse is preserved in the copies yet remaining yet pag
he sayes it is known it is granted that failings have been among transcribers and that various lections are from thence risen and we are ready to own all their failings that can be proved
so notwithstanding what hath been spoken we grant quoth i.o that there are and have been various lections in the old testament and the new
as for the old among the many other he instances in which have also spoken a little to above he sayes of these of ben asher and ben nepthali thus pag
viz in their exact consideration of every letter point and accent of the bible wherein they spent their lives it seems they found out some varieties
reply
an unprofitable improvement of mens whole lives that live no more according to the scripture then i.o sayes the iewes do as honourably as he seems to speak here of it for his own ends

there are some varities then it seems though thou canst find none or else they could not have found them

i.o sayes of those various readings of the east and western jewes that

he is ignorant of them and can't a while to look much after them to inform of their original and all that he knowes of them is that such there are and appear in bombergius his bible pag

reply
whereby i.o confesses himself to be no competent person to make any creditable censure of them so that save that he credits capellus whom he credits little when he speaks truths that make against i.o that they are not so they may be very momentary for ought i.o knowes
as to the new testament besides what i.o sayes epist pag
viz
that he evidently finds various lections in the greek copies which we enjoy and so grants that which ocular inspection evinces to be true his whole third chapter of his second treatise is totally taken up with treating of them in which he grants ore and ore again that there are various lections yea he is sain to confesse pag that of the various lections in the copies of the new testament protestants for the most part have been the chiefest collectors of them and that though at first very few were observed yet now they are swell'd into such a bulk that the very collection of them makes up a book bigger then the new testament it self and pag
that there are in some copies of the new testament and those some of them of some good antiquity diverse readings in things and words of lesse importance is and pag
that so many transcriptions as there are of the new testament should be made without some variations is undefined span alphabet i.e impossible

all which if it be not a point blank giving of the point and position at first propounded to be proved viz
that there is no change or alteration in the least iota or syllable from what they were at first in the scriptures of the old and new testament pag
the proof whereof also was for a while more frivously and fiercely then forcibly followed and prosecuted and if contrary to the said assertion it be not an yielding that there is much change alteration and various lection then know not what a resignation or rendring up of a cause is or else understand not well what i.o means but mistake him to be one that means as he sayes while he sayes one thing and means another matter notwithstanding by one means or other but fair or fowl hook or crook right or wrong effectual or weak concurring or is much at one with i.o he lifts up himself again but alittle too late having perforce once yielded so far to look after his lost assertion again to recover it and if possible to try one touch more to see if he can make it stand up in its former strictnesse wherein at first he laid it down and so in one of his wonted fits of dangerlesse fear least his giving way so much should create a temptation to his reader that nothing is left sound and entire in the letter which he falsly calls the word of god and his only perfect rule stable bottom true and sure foundation pag
he summons his sentence back into its first rigidity saying and that not out of hopes but that some may be so foolish as to believe him that with them that rightly ponder things all his own confessions and other protestants professions notwithstanding there ariseth nothing at all to the prejudice of his assertion yea all that yet appears impairs not in the least the truth of our assertion that every tittle and letter quoth he remaines in the copies preserved pag

the grounds which he judges his assertion viz
that there's no alterations or various lections in tittles and letters to stand firm notwithstanding all his grants that there are many various lections in the present copies of the are the small number the small time of standing in the world and the small importance of those various lections and alterations that are on these small and slender accounts he hopes to slide clear away and salve the censure of absurdity and falshood from befalling his so strictly insisted on assertion

yea he never leaves mincing the matter and pinching it in again and prosecuting what passes from him by way of grant to get it home again that upon the matter his giving of the cause to his opponents aftermuch stiff strict sturdy standing out in it is but like that of egypt who being forced to let the house of israel go after long struggling and reluctancy and after being afraid what would come on't ran out a ter them in much hast but as little heed as no good speed to bring them back again let it go then for granted when he saw he could hold it no longer quoth i.o
there are some various lections and mistakes but those if rightly considered are so few of so late and novel and upstart a standing and of so little moment that they are not upon a serious survey of them deservedly to be counted upon so far as to come under the consideration or notion of various lections

to this purpose are sundry of his speeches spawn'd up and down the face of sundry pages pag
those of ben asher and nepthali let any one run them throw quoth he he will find them to be so small consisting for the most part in unnecessary accents of no importance to the sense of any word that they deserve not to be taken notice of those of the east and western jewes all know of them quoth he pag
wish such as know more of them would inform me better is that they first appeared in the edition of the bible by bombergius under the care of fe
pratensis they give us no account of their original nor to professe my ignorance do know any that do it may be some do but in my present hast cannot enquire after them but the thing it self proclaimes their no importance they are all trivia and not in matters of any moment
besides these quoth he and the keri and ketib there are no other various lections of the old testament if any other can be gathered or shall be hereafter out of antient copies of credit and esteem where no mistake can be discovered as their cause they deserve to be considered
as to the sopherim or correctio scribarum by which means eighteen places are corrected all things here quoth he are uncertain uncertain that ever any such things were done uncertain who are intended by their sopherim ezra and his companions most probably pag
as to the ablario scribarum these are only about the use of the letter undefined span alphabet four or five times pag as to the corruption of psal
where instead of undefined span alphabet the iudicial copies and antwerp bibles also read undefined span alphabet simeon de mues quoth he
pleads the substitution of undefined span alphabet for undefined span alphabet to be a late corruption of the jewes least that undefined span alphabet was the keri and was left out by them
jo professes he saw undefined span alphabet in a book of his grandfathers
boxtorsuis affirms one to have been the keri the other the ketib and proves it from the

and blames the antwerp bibles for printing undefined span alphabet in the line with him many agree others contend that cari ought to be retained

see what a heavy rout here is among the divines about one iod or iota what tumbling and tangling themselves tearing pulling here is among the about their outward tittles and transcripts that they may hide the flawes that are in their foundation from being found because they have asserted that if one tittle fail their strong tower goes all down which yet the more they tamper about it the more they tell the world of the ticklishnesse of it so the foolish woman pulls down her own house and by her own brawling blames the bottom of her babel building as brittle yet sees not how by her loudnesse and clamorousnesse she shewes what she seeks to cover he that hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of his right hand which it self prov
but i.o interposes imposes and hushes all and contrary to buxtorf himself his honoured great master of all jewish learning who is an oracle with him when he can make any use of him to his own iejune purpose gives his shorter determination so he stiles it and flatly contradicting buxtorf and all that side with him in saying cari ought not to stand in the line though yet he confesses buxtorf proves what he sayes too from the massora in effect affirms with his so much praised mr pocock that it ought to be from undefined span alphabet by the epenthesis undefined span alphabet and the change which is often used of undefined span alphabet into undefined span alphabet in the line
ridiculum caput twere enough to make an animal risibile of one thats scarce rationale to see how i.o does iurare in sententiam buxtorfii so pin his faith on his for ever honoured buxtorfs sleeve sometimes and cleaves so to his opinion as if there had been some transmigration of old buxtorfs soul into i.o's
body and yet here where i.o confesses buxtorf proves what he sayes too and is backt in it also by five or six other renowned authors more cleaves asunder from him and all that cleave to him and goes by himself gleaning after the vintage of his master pocock saying straitway sith tis better for his turn at this time and more pertinent to his present purpose for all he had been so much in love with the old wine of his master buxtorfs wisdom that his master pococks miscellanean new wine is better


how wilt thou scape the just censure of contradiction to thy self i.o in that thou having mentioned these two sorts of various readings of ben asher and nepthali and of the east and western iewes thou addeft pag
that besides these there are no various lections of the old testament very positively and exclusively not only of whatever shall happen to be gathered hereafter but also of the keri and ketib the correctio scribarum or amendment of eighteen places and the ablatio scribarum or note of the redundancy of undefined span alphabet five times as no various lections and yet pag
thou thy self reckonest up and instancest in all these three sorts as such among the rest and concludest the self same thou excludest from it in the other place under that very term and title of diverse readings or various lections but this is a common thing with i.o to forget himself so as what he sayes in one place to unsay it again in another nor am without apprehensions that as he sayes of the

learned collectors of various lections pag in longo obrepsit somnus and that while he had his hands and mind busied about many things sundry mistakes did fall into his work of disproving various lections


what intendest thou i.o by that clause if any various readings shall be gathered where no mistake can be discovered as their cause they deserve to be considered is there any various lection that mistake in transcribing is not the cause of where there various readings of one text to be found in the writing as given out from god at first was there not identity and perfect exact likenesse to it self in every text term and tittle of scripture when twas written and if there be any varieties now as there are not a few are not those very varieties so many as they are so many mistakes and is it not the position it self to be vindicated by thee against all those whom in the wildnesse of thy heart thy hand is against that there are no mistakes befallen the scripture nor such miscariages as befel the transcribers of heathen authors see also
and pag
let men sayest thou propose their conjectures about the mistakes they pretend are crept into the original copies we will acknowledge nothing
and pag
we have security that no mistakes were in the text before the coming in of our saviour
so
to relieve their mistakes
so
so pag
in all which places he whose eyes are in his head may see how thou makest mistakes and corruptions mistakes and errours mistakes and falsifications synonomaes and yet here
thou makest as if there were various lections where there's no mistake as their cause and also pag
thou quarrellest with the appendix to the late many tongu'd bible in that therein whatever varying word syllable or tittle wherein any book varieth from the common received copy though manifestly a mistake superfluous or deficient inconsistent with the sense of the place yea barbarous is presently imposed as a various lection and pag
it is sayest thou against all pretence of reason that every mistake should be admitted as a various lection in which selfsame page thou renderest copies corrupted or mistaken as all one
and pag
speaking of different places to what end sayest thou should the minds of men be troubled with them or about them being evident mistakes of the scribes as if mistakes of the scribes were one thing and corruption or various readings from the first copy were another was there ever the like piece of confusion and meer mangonization of matters made before by any master in israel as this which is here made by thee i.o who one while makest mistakes and various lections one and the same and otherwhiles makes them two things so that though they do ever ponere se invicem yet often its so with thee that posito uno non ponitur alterum surely whether various lections and mistakes be in that text of scripture or no and whether various lections and mistakes be all one or no here's both various lections corruptions confusions self contradictions and abominable grosse mistakes also in thy talk about the varieties and mistakes of the letters transcribing and such an uncouth unhewen indigested disjointed incongruous unharmonious tottered kind of discourse as no reasonable man ever ran in and no reasonable man can find either

head or raylin insomuch that should any quakes have uttered the tyth of that confusion that thy speech in this matter abounds with thou wouldest have said and justly too what thou unjustly chargest them with in thy latine letter ad lectorem viz that their speech is so crude and nonsensical that thou canst not well perceive their meaning shall therefore here again as before have done and might do of twenty more places of thy book not without good cause bespeak thee in thy own words of the quakers sermonem illum quo hic bene intelligat quis inconditum illum verborum sonum omni sano sensu vacuum quo non tantum omnibus aliis qui veritatem asserunt sed ipse tibi in dicendo contradice videris mente percipere possit epist ad lectorem ex

who is able to make any thing of that raw self contradicting kind of talk thou tracest to and fro in devoid of all sound sense uncertain doubtful undistinct patcht together cloudy foolish childish unsavoury as if thou tookest care more to hide thy meaning then to speak it out plainly or make it manifest as if foring and poking so long into pococks miscellanyes thou hadst left thy eyes behind thee there and contracted to thy self some certain miscellaneous spirit that cannot tell how to distinguish any thing but mingles all things together into a disorderly masse and immethodically messe of impertinent confusion but to let it passe and proced to an observation of the rest of thy poor put offs in this kind whereby grantest various lections yet thou little lesse then denyest it again that there are any that can properly be so denominated
how deservedly is this to be noted to the shame of thy confusion and of thy self self in it that thou struglest and and struglest and yieldest and then struglest again like a drunken minded man that reeleth and staggereth to and fro in his vomit in most places of thy book wherein thou handlest the point of various lections

for as pag
thou first sayest that your copies contain every jot that was in the fst without alteration of one tittle then that its no doubt but there are some diverse readings or various lections in the copies ye enjoy then again that the whole is preserved without corruption in every letter and tittle then again that there is variety in the copies ye have but then again and thats the final resolution of the whole matter which stands to salve all from sinking that where there are any varieties fallen out by gods permission thereof its alwayes in things of lesse indeed of no importance
so pag after many grants that there are many diverse readings both in the old testament and the new as one afraid thou hast yielded too far to the

prejudice of thy assertion thou pullest in again what thou canst by speaking so diminutively of the various lections that are as if they were upon the matter just nothing at all
am not sayest thou upon the whole matter out of hopes but that upon a diligent review of all these various lections they may be reduced to a lesse offensive and lesse formidable number in which review thou reckonest as followes

i.o
let then the vulgar copy we use passe for the standard as it's right and due
rep whether this let be optative i.e a begging that it may by all be granted so to passe or imperative i.e a commanding all so to let it passe is much at one to me but as from him tis as much as to say let that copy which imagine to be most meritorious of that honour be the standard for all copies and things besides it self and it self also to be tryed by as which agrees to every tittle with the immediate manuscripts and let all that agree not with it stand but for so many cyphers and be no more accounted on then if they were just nothing at all grant me this and there will no such varieties appear as we are surprized with and my assertion will stand good so far at least that we have a copy of the scripture that is to a syllable exactly agreeing with the first manuscripts in which there is no errour nor deviation therefrom and that the same fate of hath not befallen the greek and hebrew texts of scripture as hath done other books to this effect i.o sayes to whom in short say as the proverb is if wishes were horses then lord beggars would ride but that must not be left they grow so proud as to know themselves lesse then yet they do who are so haughty and wise in their own as to know themselves in all reason too little already we may not grant thee i.o for all thy demand of it that your vulgar copy can claim such a high thing as it's right and due to stand down as an unalterable standard for all truth and doctrines and all other texts of transcript copies to be tried by till thou hast prov'd it to be to a tittle entirely agreeing with the first manuscripts which since thou confessest they are all long since perished there remains nothing but thy thoughts to try it by whether it square in every iota with them much lesse can it be prov'd to be it's due to be canonized as the standing rule whereby to prove or disprove the exactnesse of all the rest nor is the reason thou rendrest for it's right in that kind as here under followeth worth a rush

not thorowout the whole world of christendom it self which is but a corner in comparison of the world nor yet thorowout the whole protestant world which is but a corner of christendom so called and hath not been many generations yet in actuall being it self much lesse hath had your vulgar copy so long in actuall authority thorowout it yea as have above there have been and are bibles written and printed that have in them books of scripture viz that of paul to laodicea which your vulgar copy wants


but were it so yet if thou mayest be believed when thou speakest

as oft thou dost in contradiction to thy self thy reason that the vulgar copy ought to stand de jure as the standard because de facto it hath stood in actual authority so long in the christian world is rendred by thy self a very reasonlesse reason who in another place and case sayest thus
if numbers of men may be allowed to speak we may a traditional testimony given to the blasphemous figments of the alcoran but the constant tradition of more then a thousand years carried on by innumerable multitudes of men great wise and sober from one generation to another doth but set open the gates of hell for the mahometans

as therefore own not the alcoran as a standard upon the account of i.o's
reason for his vulgar copy viz the catholike owning receiving and possessing it in time and place so though prize the scripture above the alcoran as much as can do writing by divine inspiration above that which is but mans invention yet cannot own the vulgar copy of it as the standard upon such an account as it's universall reception for what he gives for the vulgar copy the same can give if it were a sound one as a reason for the alcoran viz memorandum or let it be remembred that the alcoran hath been the publike possession of many generations and in actual authority among men as a standard thorowout the whole world of mahometanism yet is not therefore to passe upon any ones intreaty or command saying as i.o of the other let it passe for the standard as its right and due
i.o
let those places be separated from the name of various lections which are not sufficiently attested to so as to pretend to be various lections it being against all pretence of reason that every mistake of every obscure private copy perhaps not above two or three hundred years or if elder should be admitted as a various lection men may if they please inform the world wherein such copies are corrupted or mistaken but to impose their known failings on us as a various lections is a course not to be approved
rep how i.o what against all pretence of reason that every mistake in every obscure copy though of two or three hundred years or more should be accounted a various lection is it not rather most unreasonable in thy self to account it otherwise does the obscurity privacy or novelty of a copy though more then three hundred years old make the various readings that are in it from the first original copy not various readings are not various lections various lections where ever they are found whether in a more ancient or in a later copy are they ever the lesse various readings because in copies which thou callest novell private and obscure

nothing it seems must be notable in the world but what comes within the narrow ken of os cognizance and comprehension its private obscure novell though known to never so many till it obtain some patent from i.o who when he knows any thing thinks that he is the first that knows what then he first knows to passe for publike and ancient among other folk though no lesse then two or three hundred years elder then himself on which account how apishly angry is he with the authors of the appendix to the late biblia polyglotta for counting the differences that are in later transcripts as various lections
whatever varying word

quoth he syllable or tittle could by any be wherein any book though of yesterday varieth from the common received copy though manifestly a mistake superfluous or deficient inconsistent with the sense of the place yea barbarous is presently imposed on us as various lection so
how peevishly complains he that all differences that could be found in any copies printed or written are equally given out as various lections many differences that have been formerly rejected by learned men for open corruptions are here tendred us again quoth he adding it is not every variety or difference in a copy that should presently be cryed up for a various reading
a man might with as good colour take all the printed copies he could get of various editions and gathering out the errata typographica print them for various lections

answer why not do not all errata whether apographica or typographica make various lections from the first undefined span alphabet in some degree at least whether they be fewer and lesser or more and grosser whence come those few errours that thou thy self ownest for various lections but from the failings and mistakes of the scribes in transcribing or the compositors at the presse from whence all the rest come which by no means thou wilt admit to be called by that name yet those that others call corruptions and various lections on the self same account as thou callest those few which thy ownest as such thou turnest them off with to what end should mens minds be troubled with them being evident mistakes of the scribes dost thou grant then that in many places of your original apographical copies there be evident mistakes of the scribes in so doing dost not thou grant all that is contended for against thee which is that in your transcriptions of the original text thou so much talkest for the entirenesse and integrity of to every letter point syllable tittle and iota the scribes were evidently mistaken so as to and the printers through whose hands the bible comes mostly or altogether now were evidently mistaken so as to many words syllables letters tittles points iotaes to the manifest corrupting of the scripture in the greek and hebrew text thereof as well as of the text in other tongues whereby it is undeniably evident to any but obstinate i.o that the same fate both hath ever and still doth and therefore may sith quod fieri potuit potest attend the scripture in its editions by transcribing as hath done doth or may do any other books and may well be asserted so to do without thy sottish senselesse unreasonable atheistical supposition and censure of its bordering on atheism so to imagine and for all thy foolish and false affirmation that the promise of god for the preservation of the scripture to a tittle require other thoughts at our hands
say why should not one various lection by a mistake in the transcribers or printers be counted and called a various lection corruption alteration of the text as well as another a lesser as well as a greater a later as well as one more ancient
wonder whose reason but reasonlesse os it is against the corruptions in copies of so great antiquity as two or three hundred years should not be numbred among others that are much elder

and sith many mistakes and corruptions are confest to have crept into copies of later times by the oscitancy negligence ignorance wilfulnesse or

something of the scribes who knew as much of late as they did of old what they were about and with whom they had to do therein and were under as much promise aspect and care of god whose providence and love to his church and word is as great for the preservation of both in these last ages as ever if his guidance of scribes and printers that transcribe and print the scripture be such a non such expression thereof as i.o would make it wonder what warrant and security i.o who denyes inspiration and infallible direction to all transcribers from the first to the last can give us of the honesty fidelity integrity ability and against the erroneousnesse carelesnesse unskilfulnesse and aptnesse to of the more ancient more then can of and against that of the later transcribers whether jewes or christians since they who know not the spirit are all as zealous now of the letter as ever and more tender and talkative and for every tittle of their text then ever they were since the world stood witnesse i.o himself yea when was there more care and curiosity and critical consideration about the exact writings printings and reprintings of the bible then is now adayes yet no editions ever come out so carefully corrected and copied out but that a man may fill a page with its errataes in more then either tittles or iotaes and if now and two or three hundred years ago why not in dayes of old know not nor any one else believe but that i.o sayes otherwise and is more ready to beleeve his own and suppositions then the naked truth and to be believed by such as dote on his doctorship then to be disproved or proved a lyar

but finally that may at once remove this sleevelesse pretence of out of the way at his command and our own leasure let those obscure private novel copies as he counts them and their corruptions be separated and removed out of his way since they trouble him so much we can abate him them and afford and spare him the setting apart of them and more too and yet carry the cause against him too out of his own mouth nor will his plea and pretence of the privacy obscurity and novelty of these if we allow it him prosper to the proving that there is no various lections in his original texts since we have it professed publikely passed and consequently proved against himself under his own hand which ever and anon pulls down what it builds up and soon after builds again what it once destroyed thus viz
i.o
that there are in some copies of the new testament and those some of them of some good antiquity divers readings in things or words of lesse importance is acknowledged the proof of it lyes within the reach of most in the copies that we have and shall not sollicite the reputation of those who have afforded us others out of their own private furniture
rep these being i.os own words whereby he hath overturned his t'other talk need talk no more on it for cannot set his babel more perpendicularly with its bottom upwards then it stands already as himself hath set it

yet for all this may think he hath qualified and salved this saying of his from the censure of a contradiction to the other by the inserting of this clause into it viz of no importance and indeed that is

the second of the generall heads whereby he seeks to heave his high assertion up into its health again after he had half knockt it on the head and laid it a bleeding by his own many grants against the truth of it

i.o
ly quoth he let the same judgement i.e of no various lections passe upon all those different places which are altogether inconsiderable consisting in accents or the change of a letter not in the least intrenching on the sense of the to what end should mens minds be troubled with them they are but evident mistakes of the scribes and of no importance at all
rep
observe how this by i.o is spoken to clear it up that there's no considerable corruptions nor various lections crept into the copies of their text and transcripts by the mistakes of the scribes and in every reasonable mans understanding tis just as if he should have thus said viz
there is no reason that men should surprize us with the sense of so many varieties of readings as they do through the evident mistakes of the scribes for though confesse there are many yet what should they be counted on as considerable as corruptions or mistakes of the scribes being they are no more then evident mistakes of the scribes and so of no importance at all whereas the very question it self that is pleaded by us against and pleaded for against us by himself is whether the scribes have been mistaken or no in their writing over the scripture so as that various lections are from thence crept into the copies of the originals bare us but all those different places quoth i.o which are but evident mistakes of the scribes which are of no importance and then let's see how many various readings you'l find in the scripture to the prejudice and impeachment of our assertion viz that the text of our original transcripts are written entirely to every apex tittle and iota agreeably to the first of the holy men that were moved to write it here's petitio principii again such a base begging of the question as is utterly unbecomming any iunior in his humanity much more a senior doctor in his divinity disputations yet a course as fowly as foolishly made use of by i.o in his disputings for the scriptures grant us the scripture to be the word of god quoth he under that very formality let us consider it and then i'le prove it so to be or else my proofs will be left naked and utterly divested of that authority and efficacy that plead in them
grant me that the evident mistakes of the scribes are not evident mistakes of the scribes in their transcribing of the scripture and then i'le prove evidently enough that the scribes were not so much mistaken as ye say they were in transcribing it

but ly as to the diminutives upon which i.o perhaps will plead he puts the prime stresse in the case in hand somewhat must be said lest i.o judge himself sleighted if they be answered with nothing but silence for as little importance as they are of to his cause and as little importance as he would by them make our assaults to be of against his arch assertion yet tis like he sets so much store by them as to suppose them to be strong supporters for his small matters and pidling propositions which to him as he sayes
are important truths to stand stedfast upon away with all those different

places quoth he which are altogether inconsiderable consisting in accents or the change of a letter or so not in the least intrenching on the sense of no importance at all lest these passe as no alterations or various lections and ye shall see anon what a little corner your corruptions ye charge upon our copies will be crouded into

rep
observe how diminutively i.o delivers himself concerning the many mistakes errours and corruptions faults and falsities that are sound to have befallen his transcriptions when he talks of translations in which the word and churches interest lyes and in which the souls of poor people that are not any further then to read the letter in lingua vernacula is much more concerned then in the greek and hebrew texts and transcripts which the linguist onely labours so much about as if all mens soules and all truth lay at stake and were eternally to live or dye at the priests mercy shutting out or letting people into the light of life by their lips as laborinthically as laboriously unlocking of that humane secret then i.o magnifies multiplyes the mistakes errors and corruptions thereof as is shewed above rendring all translations for his own ends as much mistaken the literal sense as may be yea to
and so all along in his last chapter of his second treatise from thence to the very end of it speaking of the arabick and other translations he expresses himself hyperbolically on this wise viz would make it my businesse to give instances of the mistakes ignorance falsifications errours and corruptions of these translators my discourse would swell into a volume and of the chaldee paraphrase
thus seeing it hath not lain under any peculiar care and merciful providence of god whether innumerable other faults and errours as it happened with the septuagint be not begot into it who can tell and of the septuagint it self which some clergy men cry up as high as he can do his transcript copies

thus all things here are exceedingly uncertain it's rise is uncertain some call the whole story of that translation into question as though there had never been any such persons in rerum natura nothing almost is manifest concerning it but that it is wofully corrupt and
this translation either from the mistakes of it's first authors or the carelesnesse or ignorance or worse mark

of it's transcribers is corrupted or gone off from the original in a
places twice told it's a corrupt stream a lebian rule

but when i.o talks about the mistakes errours corruptions falsifications failings of the scribes of his curious courted copies having once so critically commended them in his hast as to deny any corruptions in tittles and iota's to be crept into them so as to occasion various readings then he minifies then he nullifies as far as his little or nothing to the purpose can do it either there's none at all or if any but novell or if antient but in small matters or if in any matter of moment but very few or if never so many but euident mistakes of the scribes or in spurious copies or meer superfluities and redundancies of unnecessary and deficiencies of

necessary words or risen out of some apparently corrupted copies or other or copies corrupted by the old heretick to which heads most that are quoth he and say all that can be in any scripture are reducible what should men mind such little things for at all vau quoth he is a letter redundant but five times cari is for caru once for by a late corruption of the jewes who left out the keri that is caru and instead thereof wrote cari which is the ketib as isaac sayes who in his grandfathers bible saw caru in the line
as to that of the east and western jewes know nothing of them quoth he but that such various lections there do appear but am in too much hast to look after them as if because he professes his own ignorance about them he seemed to desire that such as know them would wink and not note them or see but say nothing of them as various lections but let them passe for none among all the rest because sees them not
a little trifling notice seems to take also as if there might be such a thing but as much as he can in a mist he carries it as the correctio scribarum or
places confessed by elias to be corrected by the scribes but quoth he
all things here are uncertain that ever any such things were done uncertain who are intended by their sopherim thus he it over and washes it off as well as he can in that sleighty way which is so thin that they are sore and sorry eyes indeed which do not see his sore through it and his sorry shifts for if it be uncertain whether there be
places first corrupted and then corrected by scribes in his text he so talks for the integrity of to a tittle yea or nay then it's not certain to that there are not yet so it must be or else his foundation of all as he calls it is found flawy and faultry in not so few places but that by his own confession that his fantastick fabrick falls all into confusion and is founded on a sandy uncertain bottom for what is utrobique incertum non est vel hinc vel illinc certum quod tibi bâc incertum est non tibi certum est illac that variety which is uncertain whether it be so or no know certainly is not certainly known not to be so but put case it be so the old miosis must make up the matter if there be
places of the divine text by men amended it's but the amendment of some small apiculi quoth he
by which saying in order to the amendment of his own bad matter he hath fell into a worse unawares but alas he sees it not as he might easily do if he were not exceedingly blinded or more then half asleep for if it be uncertain to him whether there be any such amendments or no as he sayes tis and that the particular places enumerated discover no such correction how can i.o tell what they were and that they were but of certain apiculi or smaller tittles yet he will be still of what he confesses he knows not and that it's uncertain to him

ob
if he say as he does they are all in particular considered by glassius and the matter is determined by buxtorf his renowned masier of jewish learning

rep say if the testimony of buxtorf which i.o himself sets down as written to glassius in that matter be to be credited it overturns saying that twas but of apiculi onely for buxtorf mentions them as things

which did textum sacrum in literis et sensu corrigere see i.o thy own quotation out of him in thy
page thus when men think to scrue their wits to shew themselves wise in their way against truth they oft are lest of god to bewray themselves as and and too in other cases do to be very fools for this of is much what like that testimony which the wise of old hired the souldiers to bear against christs resurrection who came to testifie as of what was done while they were asleep saying his disciples came and stole him away while we slept in which sleep it seems they could see his disciples come but not awake out of it though a court of guard to rescue him from them

so sayest i.o contrary to buxtorf whom he quotes the amendment of the
places was but of apiculi and yet confessing tis uncertain whether there were any amendment of
places at all yea or no if he knowes what was corrected then the is certain that there was a correction but if he know not whether there were any such correction made or no then not certain to him twas but of such diminutive tittles as he would make it
but this is the strain he strikes up in now and the string he hangs all on
true quoth he mistakes various lections there are but none considerable or of importance but consisting in accents or some letter not altering the sense where there is any variety it is alwayes in things of lesse indeed of no importance
and there quoting buxtorf again he sayes thus hebraei codices ubique sibi sunt similes si forte exiguas quasdam apiculorum quorundam differentias excipias quae ipsa tamen nullam efficiunt the hebrew bibles are every where agreeing except some small differences in some small tittles wch yet make no variety
thus the translations being though more for the peoples and truths but lesse for the priests and tythes turn is no great friend to them but leaves them to shift for themselves and inhaunces all the errors in them to the height and represents them through a magnifying and multiplying glasse but transcriptions being the linguists letter whereby he lives more to himself and the world then god and christ patronizes them and pleads and pinches all their impurities into parvulas and translations are none of the doctors darlings therefore he defies rather then or dignifies them so much as he does the other

at pater ut gnati sic nos debemus amici si quod sit vitium non fastidire

as fathers call the deepest defects of speech in their children lisping and their children blinkers and so makes the best and the least of his letters legible corruptions transcriptions of the two being his best friend that most helps and holds men up in academical advantages as uses to epitomize all the hypocrites iniquities into the diminutive denomination of the saints infirmities so i.o diminishes all the grosse open faults of his transcript copies into frivolous failings of no force
therefore let all these abovesaid be removed from that pretence let not every nor any varying word syllable or tittle in any book that varieth from the common received copy though manifestly a mistake superfluous deficient consistent or inconsistent with the sense of the place yea barbarous be imposed on us as such it being

not every variety or difference in a copy that should presently be cryed up for a various reading

for that were to create a temptation that nothing is left sound and entire in the word of god and so overthrow our assertion which we stand so strictly to maintain and so to them tha rightly ponder things there will arise nothing at all to the prejudice of our assertion
yea then twill quickly appear


how small the number is of those varieties which may pretend unto any consideration under the state and title of various lections and of how very little importance they are to weaken in any measure or impaire in the least the truth of my former assertion quoth he concerning the care and providence of god in the preservation of his word that is the scripture with and every tittle and letter thereof

in all which sayings collectively considered i.o had as good have said in short do but yield it that all the varieties mistakes corruptions barbarisms of what sort or notion soever fewer or more greater or lesser hurting or not hurting the sense of the place old or new by superfluity or defect of words crept in from heriticks or however are not varieties and then our assertion holds good and true viz that there is none at all or thus count not such as are of more and lesse importance prejudicing or not prejudicing the sense for corruptions and then there will be found few or no corruptions in our copies at all or thus forasmuch as they onely deserve to be considered as various lections where no mistake can be discovered as their cause and these not to be admitted as such which are occasioned but by mistakes take away all that were but mistakes from that title of various lections and all such too as were not mistakes but evidently intended as expository of difficulties or supplyed purposely to make out the sense of the places


and then there will appear to be few or no various lections or in a word excepting all those that are there's none at all as if a man that owes but twenty shillings should say to his creditor bate me but twenty shillings and i'le pay you all

but we must not let it go so i.o by whole sale though as lot pleaded for little zoar to be spared that his soul might live so thou for sparing the imposition and imputation of little impurities to thy copies that thy grand assertion which else must dye may live which is that in the least syllable tittle letter and iota thy transcripts are true and entire as the first manuscripts yet we must not separate from our the mentioning of the mistakes in iods and vau's and tittles and iota's and syllables and vowels and single letters and such like unlesse thou wilt remove from they thy strict positive affirmings that your undefined span alphabet or copies contain every iota and tittle that was in the undefined span alphabet and that haebraea volumina nec in dictione corrupta sunt and that undefined span alphabet not one iot or tittle of the text passed from what ever was written by inspiration under the law and that ye have all every tittle without any losse or any change or alteration to the least iota or syllable and much more id genus



and if thou recede from and recant that reasonlesse rigidity of thy position about the truth of thy text in tittles we shall supersede from our reasonable reply to thee concerning

the corruption and mistranscription of thy text in sundry tittles in which it seems thou art forced to confesse to us that some tittles are amisse for while thou standest so strictly upon the entirenesse of each tittle as thou sayest of the jewes p·
so of thee while thou keepest the scripture we shall never want weapons out of thy own armory for the destruction of thy haughty assertion like the philistine thou carryest the weapon that will serve to cut off thy own head for while i.o asserts the text to be entire to every tittle wee'l tell i.o out of his own book that i.o tells an untruth in that for if be to be believed by himself he o're and o're confesses mistakes in tittles iots vowels syllables and single letters

but if will agree to a cessation of armes and arguments about tittles then we shall restipulate with him there and because he doth little lesse then cry peccavi in that and keeps such an imperious begging and beseeching that all varieties in tittles that are of no importance at all may not be reckoned on as various lections here him to wit that we can here also afford well enough to abate him all different places in meer tittles and accents that intrench not on the sense and yet have enough left to lay sure siege with against his assertion if hee'l hold it about matters of importance onely and such as are inconsistent with and intrench on the sense of the place and that no further off then i.os own book which ever furnishes us wherewith to answer him out of his own armory for in that he writes thus of variety viz those which are of importance have been already considered by others especially glassius and thus
let those be removed and not counted on that are deficient in words evidently necessary to the sense of their places it evidently imports no lesse then this that i.o owns some varieties to be of importance and such as do intrench on the sense in their stations and so if we seclude all that are of lesse or no importance with him he stands still where he did undefined span alphabet condemned and confounded every way where ever he flyes or followes in the service of his arch assertion if he had no man to fight against him besides himself and if he say those of importance and that intrench on the sense are but few say if any at all they are many enough upon his predicted principles to pluck up all the fabrick of his form of religion faith about truth and the very foundation it's all framed upon by the roots as to any certainty that he hath of his standing while he stands leaning to no more but his naked letter and can plead their original no higher then from the ticklish transcripts of his pretended original text
and that this may appear let what followes be serious considered by any who have not utterly lost their understanding


that the main assertion makes so much ado about the maintaining of is this viz that though the first and immediate manuscripts and individual writings of moses and the prophets the apostles and evangelists are all utterly lost and perished out of the world


yet the hebrew and greek copies of them that remain at this day do contain every letter apex syllable accent iota tittle point that was in them without any addition of the points ablation alteration variation change or corruption by mistake or in the least notwithstanding the hands of so many transcribers as they have passed thorow

and that the text in the original languages hath been both promised to be and accordingly hath bin providentially preserved in gods love and care to his word and church so that the same fate hath not attended the scripture as to or alteration any way in the original copies of it through any miscarriages mistakes oscitancy negligence ignorance sloth carelesnesse unfaithfulnesse much lesse treacherousnesse in transcribing thereof as hath attended other books in their editions and transcribings















in all these pages and many more where the particularities of it are sprinkled up and down this general grand position is to be apprehended as affirmed by him and undertaken to be vindicated to a tittle


that this position is not onely thus punctually propounded by i.o for truth but also avouched with that extremity rigidity and strictnesse that its made the very basis of all true belief and of all that whole businesse that he calls divine saving sacred truth religion worship knowledge service of god duty of man towards him so that in case these his thoughts apprehensions position and assertion as he often calls it






proves not true firm sound but false faulty and faultring and if it ever appear that there are corruptions crept into the text of scripture by either the addition of the hebrew points accents or punctation since the beginning of the first writing thereof immediately from god as a late novell invention of some iudaical rabbins viz the tiberian massorites by whom they are judged to have been added or else by the oscitancy carelesnesse negligence ignorance treachery weaknesse or wilfulnesse of the transcribers mistaking and thereby occasioning variations in the copies of the original so that the text of scripture is not wholly pure and entire or that we may if we please reject the points and read otherwise actum est imus imus praecipites what pernitious what devious wayes must men run scarce a chapter a verse a word left free from perplexing contradicting conjectures nothing but fruitlesse contests nothing but humane fallible perswasion to be fixed on for the sense a firebrand is brought into the churches the consequences are so desperate that he dares not mention them he cannot but tremble to think what is the issue of this imagination of such a supposition that the points vowels accents are no better guides then so it renders questionable the foundation of all ejects as uselesse the whole scripture it's a pestilent poysonsome undervaluing the originals crept in now among protestants themselves though this comfort is left yet that the generality of learned protestants are not yet infected with this leven but if it should by a change of iudgement break in so on the protestant world as to be avowed in publike works the end will be a frightning poor unstable souls into the hands of the pretended infallible guide a return to rome under the pretence of the scriptures corruption in the original text as there was a passing from thence under the purity thereof yea tis not known whether this inconvenience will grow yea once suppose corruptions crept into the original text and the pretended novelty of the hebrew punctuation and then the wells and fountains from whence ye should draw all your soules refreshment are utterly stopt ep

so













better all the works

like to the biblia polyglotta were out of the world then this opinion of the to a tittle or the novelty in points should be embraced with its consequences that unavoidably attend it that if those seeming difficulties of scripture to reconcile wch some look on as undefined span alphabet or irreconcileable though some learned iewes and christians have been well exercised to reconcile and give fair account of them may by a liberty given be looked on as corruptions how ye shall be able to stay till ye come to the bottom of questioning the whole scripture he knows not


let it be considered how eminently he stands concerned upon the confession that his foundation is not firm in case a tittle of the text be wanting or the points added to it since its first giving out to make it out not probably onely but unquestionably clear and certain that the text hath every tittle and iota and that the points are no novelty but of equall antiquity with the text it self or else begin again with the qua at his a.b.c in the things of god and lay a surer bottom for his building and foundation for his faith then ever he hath laid to this day

whether os proof be infallible or but fallible of divine certainty or meer humane conjecture thought apprehension and imagination onely and whether the text be so firm and entire to a tittle as he affirms it to be yea rather that it is not let it be considered by all who read my examination of it in this now welnigh ended exercitation wherein the contrary is both apparently and abundantly evidenced his whole regiment of reasons by him rendred in proof thereof disproved and all that defensive stragling straw that hangs about them dispelled as chaffe as not onely falling short of infallible scientifical demonstration but also as not amounting to so much as a probable evidence that either the points are coaevous wh the consonants which is sometimes no lesse then asserted or so high as ezra which is undertaken to be manifested and are not rather a novelty no elder then the massorites which with such affrightments at the consequences of such a conclusion is denyed and yet as to that reviving thereof whereby we now enjoy them acknowledged also by or that the text is in its most original copies wherein we now have it is the same as at first it was without any various lections or unchanged

thus have traced after i.o in his treatings and twinings too and fro in vindication of the integrity of his greek and hebrew text and have evidently proved that there are not onely many whole books of that scripture which holy men were moved to write both before and since christ wanting to his compleated canon as he calls it but also that there are many mistakes in those books that are out of his own hand writing which is no better then snares and bands a certain piece of contradictory of his own composing to the catching and binding down himself wherein he hangs hampered intangled and tumbled up and down in his own fruitlesse contests fallible perswasions and perplexing conjectures so that there's scarce a chapter or so much as a lection in it fully free from or rather not fully fraught with some or other of his uncertain conceits and certain confusions about the defending of his assassinated assertion one while asserting and striving stiffly to maintain it in the very rigidity

universality and utmost strictnesse of it that undefined span alphabet not the iot or tittle of the original text is added altered lost sometimes assenting to the contrary onely begging that all various lections of what sort soever one or other without exception may be excepted from the account of various lections and then asserting that his assertion on that condition will stand entire concerning the entirenesse and integrity of his text to a very tittle

now then since it is so at the outward letter of the scripture not only in its translations which i.o himself asserts to be so universally altered and corrupted from the originals but a little also in its copies of the original is by i.os own confession both so abundantly altered by the addition of the points since the first writing and the variations of so many severall kinds as himself enumerates and at best so easily so infinitly alterable as that at the wills of men exercising their critical faculties about the text it may by transposition and transcription of one letter for another or supposition and subscription of one vowel for another be turned divers contrary wayes and subverted in its sense so exceedingly that some one word instancing in that word undefined span alphabet ep
may as it may be pointed or printed by undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet afford no lesse then eight severall senses as distant from one another as life and death seeing also that there is no relief against all that huge heap of uncertainty that is found among the founders that are continually confounded within themselves about their sickle foundation unlesse they will be perswaded to come to that firm sure foundation and inalterable rule of all truth the light word and spirit of god in the heart but their own vain empty groundlesse confused thoughts imaginations conceits fancies fallible perswasions and opinions taken up by tradition from each others tomes treatises targums and talmudical twatlings as if there were neither light nor spirit nor word of god throughout the whole world whereby any soul saving truth can possibly come to be known or entertained at any certainty further then the tell and teach it forth either by their talkings for tythe or manifold translatings of it out of their falsely supposed entirely transcribed copies

shall we then think because to the contradiction of himself so thinks and imposes his own thoughts on us as uncontroulable proofs that there is no variation in the copies we have from the first manuscripts of the scripture but that they are come to us without the least interveniency of any such mediums or wayes as are capable of giving change or or obnoxious to fallibility in the least syllable or iota

or that the some varieties that i.o confesses aaron and moses found in their exact consideration of the bible were small and of no importance to the sense of any word especially since with i.o if a body might take his tattle for truth every letter tittle iota there transcribed was a part of the word yea no lesse then the word of the great god wherein the eternall concernment of all soules
shall we think because i.o thinks so
that there is not any colour or pretence nor any tollerable evidence from all the discrepancies in the copies

themselves that are extant that there ever were any other in the least differing from these extant in the world

shall we think because o· so thinks

that all that yet appears impairs not in the least the truth of his assertion that every tittle and letter that was in the original copies remaines in the copies of the original to this day without any losse or any alteration or passing away of one iot thereof and that with them that rightly ponder things abovesaid there thence ariseth nothing at all to the prejudice of that his so often o're and again affirm'd assertion and if men must deal by instances in this case(as he sayes and not by conjectures though himself gives us no instance of any one copy of which he can say unlesse he had the autographa by him that it agrees every accent and syllable therewith upon any better ground then his own bare conjectures yet if had not given him instance enough of whole words verses books prophesies lost of inspired mens scriptures doth not i.o himself give us enough of variety of lection to the assuring us of the falsenesse of his first assertion which instances of his own insisting on are obvious to all readers of his book and believed by us to be true rather then his idle talk to the contrary of his texts integrity to a tittle and is there any reason as he sayes of himself and his adherents ep that we should be esteemed ridiculous because believing our own eyes we will not believe the testimony of i.o imagining otherwise then the case is according to his own instances dealing by conjectures against his own instances a man deservedly of no credit with us running in ridiculous rounds and asserting that to be truth which we know from his own book to be utterly false shall we think that the literal text in the very transcripts he so for is any other then he cals it as to its most ancient translation a corrupt stream a lesbian
or any other then some call it a nose of wax no certain stable or standard to try all truth by guide throughout in the knowledge of the will of god shall we think because i.o thinks so strangely that so corruptible and corrupted a stream as the meer letter now is since vitiated and interpolated can be judged a fit means to judge the fountain by i.e the light word and spirit it came from and a fit measure to correct and authoritatively to examine and determine those originals by shall we think because i.o hath and uttereth such high and hyperbolical thoughts apprehensions and affirmations of his transcripts and greek and hebrew copies and the absolute integrity thereof to a tittle that the sole and final dissolution determination and discovery of all saving doctrine and distinct discerning and knowledge of all sacred truth from cunningly devised fables does drd and alone upon the outward greek and hebrew writing and scripture of it and that so necessarily and eternally that upon any corruption supposed therein that truth doctrine can't unquestionably be supposed to cue entire and uncorrupt but must be consequently supposed to be without any other principle means rule or measure of judging recovering rectifying it and to be for ever brought to nought


shall we think because so thinks and supposes so that to suppose corruptions to have befallen his undoubtedly yea confessedly corrupted

copies and the same fate to have befallen the hebrew and greek bible in its transcribing that hath befallen other books in theirs is a plea unreasonable in it self devoid of all reall ground of truth injurious to the love and care of god over his word and church in a high degree and an imagination bordering on atheism asserted on deliberation
surely the improvidence oscitancy negligence ignorance unskilfulnesse and carelesnesse that may as groundedly be supposed to have been if there was never so much care and diligence in others of them in some of the scribes that have copied out the scriptures as well as in some printers that have printed them and in some transcribers of heathen authors and the of any promise of god to take any of the scripture transcribers under such a loving care and aspect as i.o ascribes to them and o's own concession of them being not any of them undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet infallible but under possibilities of mistakings and o's confessions and grants and acknowledgements that known failings have been amongst them and that various lections are from thence risen
and that some of those are of importance consisting of superfluity and redundancy of unnecessary and deficiency of necessary words which is destructive to the sense and arising out of copies apparently corrupted and notoriously corrupted by old hereticks and many more matters then are fit to repeat o're again do require other thoughts at our hands

shall we think because i.o so thinks very cogitantly but little cogently to us conjectures that if the points be mans invention and the text under alteration as undoubtedly it is and therefore all the priests religion who live on the naked texts and their own traditions and not the truth it self is at a losse however that then all is likely immediately utterly and remedilesly to perish for ever viz
church word of god doctrine truth certainty of the gospel gods promise providence and care of his eternal incorruptible good and mind will and pleasure life spirit light law yea that all this and much more is little lesse then eternally undone as to our knowledge of them so that god himself can find no other sufficient means having tryed already quoth i.o the insufficiency of all other before to save all these thing from corrupting but that of a perishing uncertain flexible at mans will fallible changeable meer dead to the light novell corruptible and in its first manuscripts already long since mou'dred moth eaten and corrupted letter
surely the promise of god for the preservation of his word which was before the letter and will be after it induring for ever so that undefined span alphabet one jot or tittle of it shall never fail what ever become of all the jots and tittles of the letter and his providence love and care of his church of whose faith and obedience that word of his in the heart and not the letter both was now is and ever will be the onely rule require other thoughts at our hands

shall we think because i.o so thinks that such a fallible flexible alterable and corruptible thing as the letter is by i.o's own confession not in its translations onely but in the very original transcripts which is the onely businesse he is so busie about and so bestirs himself to bustle for is that which can justly claim and supreamly challenge to it self those preheminent

titles excellent properties extraordinary effects peculiar prerogatives marvellous successes which i.o attributes thereuunto throwout his first english treatise and latine also wherein under that glorious name of the word of god by which yet as by that which he undertakes to prove to be it's proper name he as if not more ordinarily denominates it then by its own and proper name of scripture he magnifies the text as to those hebrew and greek copies of it he is pleased to crown as the canon and set his stamp upon as the standard while he stigmatizes not onely all translations as mens own altars and altered things that must not stand as the standard by the posts and high altar of his said unalterable copies but other copies also as novel spurious and noiously corrupted above all that hath any being under god insomuch that he cannot likely utter more concerning it in way of exaltation unlesse he should extoll it so far as to stile it god himself

so have done at present with i.o's unprofitable prate about the preciousnesse profitablenesse and divine original of his high prized possession of the hebrew punctation and with his peremptory postn and absolutely absurd assertion of the of his canonized copies of the original text to a tittle which howbeit have scarce gone above half so far as might in discovering the deep dotage and folly that is to be found in his mingled management and miserable of those matters yet have gone farther by the hall then should have done considering how far off all such husky chaffy accomplishments as those pedantick parts of the letter are from that wherein the life of god chiefly lyes viz the spirit light and word that's nigh in the heart and how little concernment the more substantial parts of the meer outward text are of thereto in comparison of them much more such accidentals as the meer figure of the accents and vowels but onely that found i.o manifesting his foppery so far as to render these ticklish things of such eminent tendency to the saving knowledge of all sacred truth as to give them out to be the most reall rule stable standard gospel guides grand ground chief infallible foundation of all in which respect though otherwise it is little lesse then loathsome to me to leave the life live in the of my self with god to meddle so much in such muddy matters yet in service to the truth and in love to the soules of the schoolmen and scribes that they may see the sandy fickle they build and found all their faith upon in the business of eternal consequence which is no better then the uncertain thoughts conceits and conjectures of men about shapes of letters points iota's
was contrary to my own first intentions carried forth to such prolixity in this matter wch conclude in this manner
where the foundation of the faith is utter uncertainty there the faith can be according to i.o no more then meer fancy and uncertainty
but so are the points as to their original and so are the transcript copies of the original text as to its entirenesse and integrity appeal to i.o's own book and all rationall readers of it and mine which points and text are by i.o and his school fellows made the canon rule guide touchstone standard and sure foundation

of all that faith and obedience which god requireth at their hands
therefore their faith toward god as yet is no more then meer fancy and uncertainty

though much more might be said i.o to many of thy matters behind mentioned yet having sufficiently swept away sundry of thy figments and false aspersions of the qua in vindication of them and turned thy lyes in plain english upon thy self which thou laidst in latine upon them about their rejecting of the scriptures and taken some useful notice of the bounds and first constitution and consignation of that ye call your canon and of what thou foolishly and falsly of the hebrew punctation of the bible and the entireness of the text to a tittle as at first shall come to some consideration of many more of thy cloudy crooked conceptions of it and of those many false tales whether not as much to the dishonoring of it in truth as to the honoring of it in pretence sith thou placest it unduely in the throne of christ let the reader judge thou very confidently tellest for truth of the scripture it self which seeing thou art first appearing in the field against the qu who are its true friends my business who appear also for it as well as thee and to state it in as high authority as salvá christi ipsius eminentiâ it may honestly stand in without high treason to the supremacy crown and dignity of christ and his light and spirit will lye mostly in reducing it from that throne and supream seat of judicature on which thou set'st it utterly against the will of christ revealed in it into its due place of a subordinate servant in the church where as a writing it summons all to come to him the light the onely iudge lord and that's able to save and destroy who by his light sits in the conscience of all to try all for life or death searching the heart and reins to give to every one according to their wayes works and fruit of their doings and what thou displacest will stand all in its due rank and proper order

thy grand assertion then of the scripture unto which all almost of the other that thou predicatest of it is as it were but subordinate and some of it subservient to the proof of as also it is subservient to the proofe of some of that whereof yet some is so promiscuously in such a confused way of mingle mangle treated out that one can't tell well whether it be proprounded in proof of the scriptures being the word of god or the scriptures being the word of god is made demonstrative of that yea the same things are sometimes interchangeably praedicated in mutual proof of each other for to prove the scripture to be the word of god thou urgest its self evidencing efficacy and power and to prove it to be living efficacious and powerful thou

urgest its being so from places that speak onely of the word of god not the letter of it and many more such like ratelled pieces of proof there are in thy unhewn but say the grand assertion thou prosecutest the proof of thorowout thy first english treatise and much what in the first is this viz that as to name and thing the scripture properly is the word of god and having hous'd it under this high title and in thy own crooked conceit of it crouded it by fowl more then fair means and by force of arms as may say more then force of honest arguments under the starely canopy of that compellation thou afterwards callest it on that account many things more so much as one of which it is not yea consequently any thing every thing that the word of god it self alone and not the scripture truly is and by right onely is to be called

first then thou i.o affirmest of the scripture the letter of it that it is the word of god in esse reali in esse cognoscibili i.e not onely so but known so to be and that as to name and thing
that as in its nature it truly and properly is so so that glorious title of the word of god is its own due right true proper name which the qua denying to it and seeking to draw it in discrimen nominis into a difference in name from do no less then divest and spoil the scripture of its proper name and this thou sayest ex l.s is the work which the quakers rejoice at that it is committed to them by satan for which onely thou takest them to do as if thou hadst no more to do with them nor they with thee then de scripturae nomine proprio as thou there speakest and as if the qua did yeild the scripture to be the word of god and had nothing against its being so as to its proper nature and yet would not endure to allow it to be called by its own proper name that is most answerable to its own nature
rep
not too fast at first least what thou writest in haste thou come to repent by leisure thou mistakest thy self very much as to thy busie busling with the qua who may possibly find thee more work then thou art aware of before they whom thou beginst to lash and lash out against in thy latine have done with thee they seeke not meerly to bring the scripture to which they ever allow its own proper name in discrimen nominis back to its own name from those many not due to it but to the word its the writing of from which word in the night your have stole them to stile it by but also in discrimen rei to manifest it to be what it really is and no more then what it is to you and others who not onely call it but count it to be what it truly is not
the qua are not such idiots yet as to rob any things as you do many of their own proper names nor so foolishly fanatical and fantastical as to spend their time in inanibus logomachijs or so but that if thou canst prove the scripture to demonstrate it self ex

infallibly and uncontroulably pag to be the word of god as thou undertakest to evince but ad graecas calendas to morrow come never as they say thou wilt do and not before they will then freely grant it to be call'd so whose work with thee and all men is to have all things first known to be what they are in their proper and then call'd by those proper names that are agreeable to those natures

though then we deny the scripture to be called by that of the word of god as its proper name yet it is upon this account because neither thou nor any man in the world is able to prove it to be so in its proper nature whereupon howbeit we eternally own the word of god properly so to be and infallibly and incontroulably evidencing it selfe so to be and that it ought as by its own proper name to be called the word of god which if thy tottering ragged way of argumentation wherein thou ten if not twenty times over and more inadvertently and contrarily to all rules of true disputations transposest thy making the word of god both thy subject and the praedicate also which thou often praedicatest of it self be well observed thou belabourest thy self to prove against know not whom to be evidently and to be called properly the word of god and howbeit we also own the word of god to be all those other things viz foundation rule light touchstone of god onely means of the saving knowledge of god most effectual means of bringing men to repentance quickening power power of god to salvation and many more by which thou denominatest it nevertheless that the scripture or outward writing or external text of either your copies of the original or the original copies which you have not now in the world much more that the text of any translation thereof into other tongues or the english tongue either which is all that poor english people have who are no higher learnt as to earthly languages then their much more that every tittle iota and apex of any of these as thou apishly contendest it is in your transcripts at least pag
is either the word of god or any of those things or properly to be called by that of the vvord of god by which yet thou streinest a point to call it and dost o're and o're either under that term the vvord or that of the scripture which is onely properly its own this is that which am here entering the lists with thee about and am to the undeceiving of both powers and people of this nation who by your sophistical sorceries are bewitcht into a blinde opinion about both the truth and the qua who hold it out in that particular notwithstanding thy pretensive proofs to disprove against thee

nevertheless before can yet come immediately to the examination of thy proofs in particular in order to the disproof thereof or to thy own holding out of any thing to the contrary so many great and gross are the absurdities and illegalities of thy manner of disputation in proof of this business viz that the scripture both as to name and thing is and is infallibly and undeniably known to be the word of god that may not honestly pass on here without a discovery to all men of thy most illegitimate and downright dishonest dealing in thy driving on of thy argumentation to the evincing thereof in sundry particulars which shall exhibit to the view of all men under this one general head viz thy unworthy begging of the main question in hand which thou takest upon thee to prove as well in thy english treatise upon that subject which thou sayest thou hadst preached on which as published is a dispute too for the scriptures as in thy latine illogical and theological disputations or apologeticals pro scripturis in both the one and the other of which thou never keepest close to thy main terms which ought never to be altered in any legal disputation but both changest and confoundest them together even the grand subject that is the scripture

and the grand praedicate of it that is the word of god almost as often as thou hast to do with them insomuch that thy and transactions for and about the outward letter or text of the scriptures which are the subject from whence thy latine and thy english works in their title
pages both bear their main denominations of vindication of and apologies for the texts of the scripture the proof of which to be the known pure perfect powerful living spiritual saving necessary unalterable unchanged uncorrupted word of god is thy main professed work scope drift and intent thoroughout them are such an indistinct argumentation such a agonized mess of male proof such an underboard piece of as proclaims its author as well to such as know him by neither as to such as know him both by name and face to be one that not play but digged as deep as he well durst for fear of being too much in his deceit on the other hand to hide his counsel that he might be the less noted in his turnings of things that having once put apart as two specifically different things the scripture or its doctrine whereof one was to be his main subject the other his main praedicate throughout his disputation durst not keep them clearly asunder as he should have done all along in his premises till he came to his conclusion in which onely if at all they were by right to be joined nor speak of them constantly sigillatim as of two things formally seperated in their nature to be seperated in their names till the one he infallibly or plainly proved to be the other viz the scripture to be the word of god and the word of god to be the scriptures but being jealous whether things might grow to the disadvanta or hazard of hi cause in question and utter loss of his positive assertion of the scriptures to be the word of god if he should was afraid to speak plain so believe thou i.o art to utter thy meaning too openly or speak thy mind out too distinctly and so chusest to prosecute thy proofs the more promiscuously and to carry thy ill cause on the more confusedly by the shifting and changing of thy terms ever and anon and to beg the question in hand or take it for granted before it be given thee that the scripture is the word to supplant and forestall thy reader with thy often or ordinary crouding of these each under the other's name and indifferent denominatings of them each by the other as before thy time i.e
before thou hast proved the name of the one at all proper to the other by the one's true participation of the others essential properties or nature so that like the caepia that being pursued by its adversaries flings a flood of black inky stuff behind it to hide it self from being seen and taken by a blind blending and cloudy confounding of things together which being treated of formaliter and discoursed of divisim each under its own peculiar form and proper name and nature both thy own folly and the falseness of thy propositions should be discovered yea by pidling and pedling and playing fast and loose thou seem'st to puzzle the minds and put out the eyes of such as shall ever prosecute thee for thy rotten principles insomuch that may truly say of thee what thou untruly utterest concerning the qua pag
of thy latine tract viz quaenam sit horum hominum sententia haud facile quis declarabit
and so mutatis mutandis turning all thy verbs out of the person plural into the person singular may safely sing back

to thee in thy own words as follows viz

what thy mind j.o is in this question whether the scripture be the word of god or no one can hardly declare for besides that thou agreest not with thy self thou dost so foolishly and nauseously prate in the opening of thy mind and meanings and playest about in words of an uncertain and dubious signification and usest for the most part certain forraign phrases containing no sence that can well be understood by any that are well in their wits which are enough either to astonish or bewitch unskilful men so that it's more easie to confute thy arguments then conceive thy meaning yea when thy opinion is so foul and dishonest that if the fair pretences and covers be removed and it distinctly unfolded it sufficiently destroyes it self amongst all honest men that are not openly dishonest endeavouring what thou canst so delude either thou speakest is not out openly or else manglest it to pieces in such a sticht and patcht up forme of speech that can signifie nothing at all and so darkening thy counsel by words without knowledge thou seemest to be afraid of nothing more then least thou shouldst be understood

in such wise as this i.o dost thou proceed in thy present paper works that are now under examination having in thy hast heedlesly uttered forth some faucied falsities about the bare letter and meer outside of the scriptures and every tittle and transcribed iota thereof viz
that these are the true spiritual light and authoritative powerful word of god and such like and after fearing the falshood of such forward expressions from which as most of thy fellow wise men are in the like case who though they are foolish and ignorant enough yet of all things in the world are loath to seem and even abhor to be accounted so to be thou art ashamed totally to recede and recant so as altogether to go back which rather then do when ye are once over shooes thou and thy generation chuse to be over boots also thou staggerest and reelest now this way now that and to mend and moderate the rigidity of thy positions about the scripture for the saving of thy credits sake as far salva ac celeberrimae sapientiae gloriâ as is consistent with thy credit another way thou wheelest about and frequently foisting in the predicate into the place of the subject and that term the word of god in the room where this term only viz the scripture should stand even while thou art but in thy proof of the scripture to be the word thou darknest thy counsel by words utterly without knowledge and rendrest thy self ambedextrously and ambiguously that thy reader may not well read thy meaning in what thou writest nor whether when thou avowest the scripture to be the word of god and powerful thou intend'st the scripture it self that one individual thing call'd the letter or writing which alone is

the very formality of the scripture or the other individual thing which is not at all the outward scripture though so called often by thee viz
that word of which the scripture only speaketh for one while thou singlest out that grand subject of thy dispute the scripture and setting it apart from the doctrine faith divine truth and vvord it writes of seemest as if all along thou wouldest discuss the things thou praedicatest of it under that single notion of its being an external writing apart from the doctrine and word of faith written of therein as tr

expressing thy self thus viz not onely the doctrine in it but the undefined span alphabet the very writing writings book it self is so and so thereby leading thy reader up and down by the nose up into the air into a high expectation of thy handling the scripture formally quatenus scripta as a writing as written which is the onely subject promised to be treated on and for in the title pages and of thy proving it as to be the word and mighty power of god from whence thou tumblest him down again and frustrating those his former expectations other while conjangletim thou jumblest these two as synonomaes into one in many such or the like expressions viz the writing or written the undefined span alphabet or the doctrine as written and tr


the scripture or written vvord of god and
now the scripture the vvord of god is light the innate arguments that the word of god is furnisht withall for its own manifestation contain the full or formal grounds of our answer to that question why we receive the scripture see how these terms are twisted one into another to be the word of god tr


thus thou usest them so promiscuously as if they being with thee entirely one twere indifferent and no matter at all which of the two thou expressest thy self by saying sometimes the scripture is a light a moral and spiritual not a natural light as tr

the scripture makes a proposition of it self as the vvord of god tr


for the proof of the divine authority of the scriptures if the booke be brought to him or them that acknowledge it not the vvord there thou goest off again left with them it will evidence it self
the scripture it enroll'd among things that are able to evidence themselves
i.e the scripture is absolutely called the power of god
the scriptures of the old and new testament do abundantly and uncontroulably manifest themselves to be the word of the living god so that meerly upon that account of their proposal of themselves to us in the name and majesty of god as such without contribution of help or assistance from any thing else without themselves we are obliged upon the penalty of eternal damnation as all are to whom by any means they came or are brought to receive them with that submission of soul which is due to the word of god


the scripture being brought unto us it doth evidence it self infallibly to our consciencet to be the word of the living god


if the question be vvhether the doctrines proposed to be believed are truths of god or fables we are sent to the scripture it self and that alone to give the determination



surely men will not say the scripture hath its power to command in the name of god from anything but it self


them that own the booke whereof we speak to be the word of god


how know we that the scripture is the word of god how may others come to be assured thereof the scripture say we beares testimony to it self that it is the word of god


and in thy two

treatises which treat all along of the text thou tellest it more that every letter and tittle that they were transcribing and to be transcribed of the old testament by the jews was part of the word nay the word of the great god wherein the eternal concernment of souls doth lye
these and much more ejusdem furfuris are the wayes wherein thy minde makes out it self sometimes sometimes again as if thou wert somewhat sensible of having not a little overshot thy self by thy too too eminent expressions and lofty undertakings for the naked scriptures which can never possibly be made good of them to palliate all thy proud boastings and broad shews and too too ample settings out of a bare body or bulk of letters and ward writings thou drawest thy neck out of the collar wherein it hung slylie flink'st away and shrinkest back standing like caesar at rubicon with one foot over he and the other on this side saying yet may go on and by and by yet may go back not resolved which way to betake thy self whether to go on in thy high and hasty undertakings for the scripture upon that old single score of its being but barely scripture least thy proof should not hold at so high a rate or whether to double thy files by bringing them two both into one again that were sometime sundred viz the scripture and the doctrine or word of truth it treats of the outward writing and the word of faith within that is written of which could not be made appear consider'd sigillatim or apart to be both of them the word of god and at last though that be bad enough there being no better way in the sight of one that loving the praise of men more then the praise of god is loath among men to be mock't at as the builder that begins and cannot carry it to an end having another string to thy bow thou strengthenest thy weake business what thou art able furtively clapping a greater glory light power and honour in respect of titles about that dark dead weak and naked body of the writings then that which considered by it self it can duely and lawfully challenge notwithstanding thy unwary assertions not onely elsewhere but also ex

viz
that scriptura hoc verbi dei nomen sibi the scripture challengeth this name of the word of god unto it self even that of the inward living word of god it self to which alone all that glory and those glorious names by right are due and not to the letter and were due before the letter was when thou hast laid the true unchangeable inward truth and word of god instead of the letter the outward and thy outwardly beloved changeling and subtilly shrowded it under that name and notion of the word of god which is the very thing in question and the name to be disputed on whether it be due to it or no and is as much still denied by us as it is by a piece of sophistical thievery taken by thee to be its undoubted right before it be either proved by thee or by us or any but ignoramus himself granted to the
then come let us sing a new song thou marchest forward again driving on thy self same old dispute concerning a new stol'n different subject which is now prest to serve as both thy subject and thy praedicate and to supply the proper place of both which being denominated and praedicated all along of it self all thou sayest of it is most undoubtedly true and uncontroulably thou carryest all clear before thee crying it up to this purpose viz that of a truth the word of god is a light the word of god is living the word of god is perfect of divine authority the word is the

most glorious light in the world a shining illuminating light preferr'd that of the sun

the word of god is furnisht with innate arguments for its manifestation of it self to be the word of god

there is in the dispensation of the word an evidence of truth commending it self the consciences of men some receive not this evidence is it for want of light in the truth it self no that is a glorious light that shines into the hearts of men

the word comes by what means soever it hath in it self a sufficiency of light to evidence it self to all that authority of god its author which authority is with i.o its power to command as the word of god
the word makes a sufficient proposition of it self ver it is he that hath the witness

of god need not stay for the witness of man

for the witness of god is greater
whereever the word is received indeed as it requireth it self to be received and is really assented to at the word of god it hath its power of manifesting it self so to be from its own innate light thy vvord is truth
thou hast magnified over all name the word thou hast spoken the name of god is all that whereby he makes himself known yet over all this god magnifies word

leave the word with men and is it evidence not it self unto their consciences it is because they are blinded
in all which sentences and many more that might be mentioned there's no mention of the scriptures by the old true term of the scriptures though that name is interwoven too in every page to denote that although the discourse that is in proof of their being the word of god is driven on in their behalf under that new name of the word of god yet by that word the word we may know that by i.o the scriptures are still intended but as if the sole use of that single name of scriptures might prove too weak a term to venture the stress of the whole cause upon and too empty an engine to carry it by its carryed along also under that more trusty term of the word of god by which name i.o by a thing call'd petitio principij granting himselfe leave to call the let ter before it's given undertakes to prove it to be the word of god and most uncontroulably proves it so to be so far as the letter he calls the word of god is really so though for all his seeming to himself to have won all not one jot farther then its so indeed that indeed is not at all having gotten such a noun substantive as the true word of god is which can stand by it self under its own name of the vvord of god without objection in all propriety of speech and signification and is every way able to evidence it self to be the vvord of god and is seen felt heard of them that heed it and understood not denyed so to be by the qua to stand by his noun adjective assertion of the scripture so to be which cannot stand by it selfe under that name in any propriety of speech or sound sence reason or signification then he runs an end nemine ontradicente none opposing or withstanding him in his progress nor however reserving alwayes a liberty to themselves to dissent as they see occasion from his meaning so much as once him in his terms with a hideous hue and cry for the word of god striving to restore it by his repetitions of it to that title which it never lost among the qua who being begotten and born again into the image of god by it are by whom onely it stands truly justified the children of it and of the truth scribling it over with all his might the word of god the word of god the word of god is a light and the word of life the word of

god is the powerful and living and efficacious word of god the word of god is the word that dwells and dives within the heart the word of god doth evidence it self to be and therefore is without controle the word of god yea thus with a non obstante to all that deny the word to be the word which are none at all j.o if it may be first granted him that the scripture is the word will undertake to prove it beyond without all further question to be the word
thus jo howbeit by that terme the word of god he means the scripture all along in his book saving in one place where he calls the word essential and effective yet as if he had utterly forgot that his business is to prove the scripture to be the word of god as if he had remembred himself after he was entred that his proof would not hold out without a palpable appearance of piteous weakness if he should have prosecuted it throughout under that terme of scripture takes his predicate and makes that his subject also and in terminis goes all along asserting and assuring us the word of god is un doubtedly the word of god yea tr

he goes on to prove that the word of god doth evidence it self to be of god and is of as much or more excellency and efficacy then his works and innate light to reveal god and give the knowledge of his will not so much as once mentioning the letter or scripture at all which is the subject he there takes on him to speak of in all the following sections to the chapters end so be labouring him all along to prove another question then that he affirmed viz that the word is so and so when his business was to have proved the scripture to be the known word of god for who denies that the word of god is assuredly his word but that the letter is that word is that which is denied and by him undertaken to be proved yet on he goes in his wonted blundring manner upon that term the word of god the word is undoubtedly evident to be the word making that both suject and predicate whereas he should have said all along if the light and gods outward works do so much more doth the scripture or the letter evidence it self to be the word of god so giving his reader no more to understand what his meaning is but that we know it some way else nor which is which by any distinction in his found or shewing when he speaks of the scripture which is the copy of it or the word it self which is that in the heart declared of in scripture which he was to prove the scripture to be then the that being to give evidence before a court between two that were fighting who began and was most in fault answered no otherwise then in this confused manner viz
if him had struck him as him did him either him had killed him or him him without any indignation of which of the two he meant either this or that by any or by all of his many hims

in this confused indistinct manner doest thou j.o dispute for the scriptures being and appearing to be the word of god so that none but folk knows what thou pleadest for viz whether the scripture it self singly and formally considered about which the controversie is whether it be the word of god or no or the word of god it self about which no controversie at all with the qu who own gods word to be his word yea draw up all thy rambling matter into a closer form and thy arguments which though thou call but some of them inarteficial and the rest arteficial yet are in truth the most inarteficial ones that ever saw fall from the hands of an

artist or ever heard called truely by the name of arguments into a nearer compass and set them in a true fair syllogistical form and order and they will appear either most false or foul or disorderly or sophistical or deformed

reader for a taste take one or two of j.o.'s
mediums letting alone the examination of the strength and force of his arguments whether such as he calls arteficial or inartificial and of their true consequence or inconsequence as to the scriptures appearing to be the word to its due and see what a kinde of matter they make or amount to as j.o orders or rather disorders his matters by his impostural intruding of one subject in place of another and thrusting in of that terme the word of god which is the main thing predicated of the scriptures to stand instead of that terme the scriptures of which it is by him predicated and to be proved both in esse reali cognoscibili ex

laid the divine original of the scripture as the basis of all his babylonish building and as he saith


opened the manner of the words

coming forth from god to prove the scriptures of the old and new testament to be the vvord of god much of which makes against himself at large in a long train of perplexive prittle prattle throughout his whole second third and fourth chapters from the property and efficacy of the scriptures which aforehand still he calls the vvord of god but to shut it all up together in short to this purpose viz
that which evidenceth it self to be the word of god that is and is known assuredly to be the word of god but the word of god doth evidence it self unto us to be the word of god therefore the word of god is and is known assuredly to be the word of god

the minor in this syllogisme none denieth it being true in those termes it here stands yet it is false and sophistical as falling from him who by that term the word of god in the sore part of the proposition means the scriptures the utter falshood of which minor and so consequently of the conclusion which is now true but aliud a negato would have too plainly appeared if he had not sophistically placed that subject i.e the word of god as it stand formost in both in the room of the right subject i.e the scriptures or if he had not changed his minor term but exprest himself thus viz
but the scriptures do evidence themselves to be the word of god therefore the scriptures are and are known assuredly to be the word of god and to prove that minor j.o useth another medium viz
gods magnifying his word above all his name by which minore ad majus i.e from the power of smaller matters as he counts them i.e the works of god

and the light in the conscience the law written in the heart and the notions inlaid there with his own finger which he calls the voice of god in nature for these are low darke obscure principles and means of revealing god and his will with j.o in comparison of the writings and letters that are inlayed in parchment and paper with the finger of meer man which low principles yet are able to plead their own divine original and evince them to be of god he argues at large that the word of god scripture again he should have said doth much more evidence it self to

be his word and to put his lax and loose words into a narrower room and into a more argumentative or syllogistical posture thus viz
if those inferiour names of god whereby he makes himself known even his works without and his light his law written in the heart and conscience

to which there need be no other witness that when they testifie god's righteousness or holynesse and call for moral obedience which is eternally and indispensably due to him they speak from god do evidence themselves to be what they are and to be of him then much more his word the scripture he should have said which god magnifies over all his name

must evidence it self to be his word but those inferionr names do evidence themselves and therefore much more doth the word of god the scriptures again he should have said evidence it self to be the word of god

rep what a strange story is here as if a man should tell a tale of two things a cock and a bull metamorphos'd into one whereof the one having been as confidently as untruly avowed to be assuredly known to be the other viz
the cock to be a bull is being denied as ridiculously as reasonlesly profer'd to be proved in this illegal and illogical way of argumentation viz
that which evidenceth it self to be a bull both is and is assuredly known to be a bull but the bull alias the cock for so he means should say evidenceth himself to be a bull therefore the bull or the cock both is and is assuredly known to be a bull

in this shameful manner and sorry sort doth i.o having once audaciously avouch't it go about to prove the scriptures to be and to be assuredly known to be the vvord of god by anticipation sophistically substituting that subject the word of god in his disputation for it in the room of the legal subject i.e the scriptures taking it perforce from such as give it not for granted that it is so while to its yet no more but the thing in question and utterly unproved so to be which question i.o not onely begs but also begs so unworthily and basely that never saw the like to it but once

before in all my life and the like to it can't likely be seen again unless a man should beg it on his knees little less then plainly confessing that unless it be aforehand granted him that the scripture is the word of god he cannot possibly prove it so to be what wise man that is as willing to do the truth right as thee i.o no wrong can make any better construction of thy own words as they are to be read in the sect of the
chap of thy first treatise where professing that in the remainder of thy discourse thorowout that treatise which is all in proof of the scriptures being assuredly

the word of god thou shalt endeavour to clear and vindicate the evidencing efficacy of the scripture and the grounds thereof by such common mediums as shall as well reach the reasons of such men as acknowledge not the scripture to be the word of god as of such as do thou desirest in effect onely to have thus much first granted thee that thou mayest have leave the scripture being that out of which thy proofs for and grounds of this efficacy of the scripture to be the word of god are to be taken to consider the scripture as tis the written word of god or else all thy proofs will be weak and able to prove just nothing

this onely quoth i.o to recite his own words shall desire to promise that whereas some grounds of this efficacy seem to be placed in the things themselves contained in the scripture shall not consider them abstractedly as such but under their formality of being the scripture or written word of god without which consideration and resolution the things mentioned would be left naked and utterly divested of their authority and efficacy pleaded for and be of no other nature and importance then the same things found in other books which is as much as to say being by the scripture to prove the scripture or writing both to be and to evidence it self to be the word written or the written word of god let such as deny it deny that their denial of it and but first own it with me that the scripture or writing formaliter is the written word of god and let us but under that name nature notion and formality consider it and then let me alone to prove it to them so to be or else must acknowledge that all have to say will be just nothing to the purpose and of no validity at all to the proof thereof

denyers of it by begging of them first to grant it and if they will not by beating what he can the belief of it into them by his often calling the horse a man and bearing them down that he is a man before he begins and under that very name and formality of his being so begins and proves him to be evidently so in this following form viz
that which doth evidence it self to be a man is a man but a man horse he should say but then the naked untruth of this minor would be too manifest doth evidence himself to be a man therefore a man alias horse doth evidence himself to be a man

but as for many of those juniors what the seniors may do know not or younger sort of students and in the vniversity to whose use and instruction thou dedicatest part of thy booke though thou being once a man of some authority among them they may possibly not be so bold nor so loud as to laugh out at thy doings and at thy idem per idems yet they will scarce forbear laughing at them in their sleeves yet this is thy sophistry i.o call'd among schollars petitio principij or a begging of the question before one begins to prove it a taking of that to be a ground principle or foundation to build on which is not yet granted but to be debated nor another thing from the thing debated or inquired after but the thing which is in controversie and as unknown as that that is disputed

for the question between thee and the qua is whether the scripture be in essereali cognoscibili the word of god or no we deny it thou being to prove it so to be wouldest have it first granted or at least takest it ungranted so to be and then out of it self it being granted thee so to be thou wilt undertake to prove it so without which concession consideration and resolution thou even grantest the things thou art to alledge will be naked and utterly inefficacious to that purpose out of which way of sophistry it seems thou canst not prove it and in which way though de jure thou oughtest not yet de facto thou doest prove it as much and no whit more then as is said above the cock is proved to be a bull and a horse a man whilst thy argumentation in many places is no better than this viz that which is the word of god doth evidence it self to be the word of god but the word of god scripture or writing thou shouldest say but dost not every where lest thy nakedness too much appear is the word of god therefore the word of god doth evidence it self to be the word of god
in which syllogism which is thine if the long loyns of thy loose dispute and that stragling multitude of thy matter of proof be girded up close into its own mifigured form thy minor hath subjectum aliud substrato a different subject from that which was of right to stand there and to be proved to be the vvord of god viz the vvord of god which is idem cum predicato the with that which is predicated of it and thy conclusion infers aliud negato quite another thing then that which is denied for that the

vvord of god is by it self evidenced to be the vvord of god is as much undenied as it is undeniable by us but that the writing in which the vvord is but held forth and declared is the vvord of god that is held out and declared by it this shall make as bold and as warrantably against any one to deny as should against such a sot as following a foolshead of his own should assert such a thing that the glass window thorough which the sun shines and the lanthorn thorough which the light of the candle shews it self are of a truth and in very deed respectively the very sun it self or it self that display themselves thorow the said glass or horn or that the by which the vvine gives its colour and is handed out that men may drink it is truly and properly the very wine itself that is given out to be drunk of and that sparkles and gives out his goodly colour in the glass or that the picture of a prince or eminent person is in esse reali cognoscibili and in all propriety of speech so to be called the very prince or person him self it is but the image of or the map of the city london rome jerusalem is the very city it represents so that he bereaves it of its proper name that will not allow it to to be any otherwise but figuratively so called

now as to the scriptures being the word of god and evidently known to be so or evidencing themselves to be so and that of right and properly they are to be so called all which thou j.o very absolutely averrest do here as absolutely deny confessing that if they be so or can be evidenced so to be they ought accordingly so to be called or else not for tum demum propriè dicuntur resfieri quoad nos cum incipiunt patefieri what is not so is not known to be so much less can challenge that as its proper name so that if in essereali they can be made appear to be the word of god then give the rest for granted or if make it appear that they are not so then all wise men that not for want of ignorance of it yet do not will once grant that they are not so infallibly known as j.o avouches they are to be the word of god and that the word of god is not the proper name of the scriptures so distinctly and abstractively understood as is above said
and seeing that thou j.o art first out in the field appearing for them its but meet that should first examine what thou urgest in way of evidence for their being the word of god and so subjoyn what have to say truly of them against what falsely thou hast said
and seeing that which thou thy self layest as the very basis and foundation of thy whole brittle building and of all that divine authority ascribed by thee to the scripture of its being owned sub paena to be submitted to as the word of god on peril of eternal damnation is its divine original and is best also to be first medled with that the bottome being shaken and shewed to be unsound the body of sticks and straws thou buildest thereon which is torn and shattered not a little within it self as it stands untouched in the eye of any intelligent and observant reader may yet with the more ease and less labour be shaken to the ground shall enter first at the front of thy formidable forces and begin to undo where thou beginnest to do thy do which yet will not be so much in one sense to undo as truly to do right to the truth about the letter which thou wrongest in uttering so many utter untruths concerning it as thou doest


the whole authority of the scripture in it self depends solely on its divine original pag
this original is the basis and foundation of all its authority pag

rep as to the divine original of the scripture which is the first and fundamental matter that in the very original or first chapter of thy first treatise thou pleadest on its behalf as in proof of its divine authority or right to be owned as the word of god deny not but that it is of divine original and so one way or other is every thing else that hath a truly good and honest being yea the very devil himself as a creature of god though neither any of his deeds which are sin which is deceit and defect nor himself quà undefined span alphabet as he is a deceiver and as immediate an original from god as any meer writing or scripture in the world hath this scripture hath and some little of it such an immediate emanation from god as neither the most of it self hath or ever had nor yet the best that ever any holy man of god was the of now hath or ever had acknowledge that scripture which is the present subject had at its first giving out to men for a few words of that outward writing the writing or letter of which yet though the matter still remains and ever will when all writing fails is lost and perished out of the world as well as the original manuscripts of the holy men who wrote the rest was written more miraculously at first then with the hands of holy men namely some with such fingers as came out from the wall by appointment in belshazzars carousing room dan

but what of all this that the meer transcripts of that text which was so immediately though little or none of it so immediately from god as j.o contends neither or at least none at all of it immediate unto us that our modern transcripts say thereof which is all that is immediate to us and which j.o who confesses all the undefined span alphabet or first writings to be lost busies himself to prove to be so are at all immediately come forth from god to us or that that letter which was most immediately penned from gods own hand is thereupon evinced to be truly and in proper location the word of god or any more then externa mera licet vera undefined span alphabet a meer though true outward copy expression or express image as vox omnis is and scripture too ad intra of the word of god which is that only that is written of and not the writing of it

shall consider this matter of the scriptures original both absolutely taking notice of a few of thy false and foolish fancies about it and also relatively as it's laid by thee as the basis of the scriptures divine authority or being word of god

the laws doctrines instructions stories promises prophesies given out by the writers of the scripture were not their own conceived in their minds nor form'd by their reasonings nor retained in their memories from what they had heard nor by any means comprehended by them pet
but were all of them immediately from god so as that there was onely a passive concurrence of their rational faculties in their reception without any such active obedience to as by any law they might be obliged pag
rep many things in this parcel are utterly false being uttered as they are of the whole scripture and all its first for what is said of the old as to the immediate manner of its giving forth is said also saist thou pag
of the new insomuch that its not onely very fond but savouring also of no small ignorance both of and in the scripture for any such minister of no more then the meer letter of it as our are much more below the ministers of the spirit to hold out for truth or so much as to imagine within themselves and as they are utter untruths so much lesse are they of force to evince that false assertion to be truth which thou j.o wouldst conclude from thence viz that their writings are uncontroulably known to be the word of god


what a crude conception of thy vain mind is this that the laws doctrines instructions stories promises prophesies written which confess were not their own formed as many if not most of thy false doctrines and strange stories about the scriptures are thine own formed by reasonings were not so much as conceived in the minds of the were they not conceived in them by the holy spirit and by them so as that for the most part at least they understood knew and believed them as truths before they committed them to writing as they were moved by the spirit of god to do for the use of others and though they wrote not but at the will of god and his spirit pressing them thereunto and under the burthen of the word of the lord that lay upon them till they had discharged themselves of it

yet art thou so silly as to conceive they delivered things before they were conceived in them so far at least they were conceived in and by them too as to prove thy saying little less then senselesse and absurd


vvhereas thou sayest they were not retained in their memories from what they had heard nor by any means comprehended by them is not that as absolutely absurd and false as the rest did they in writing declare things for truth and teach doctrines and give out instructions and

tel stories relate passages before they had so much as heard of or seen or believed or embraced what things they wrote rehearsed or entertained them as such or by any means beforehand comprehended them is not this directly contrary to what the apostles say who had and wrote from the same spirit of faith with them of old who write thus cor

sith thou saist the things they wrote were not retained in their memories from what they had heard did they first heare and see and believe and comprehend and entertain them into their memories and then not retain but let them slip and quite forget them before they wrote and then began to write when they had and not before they had remembred to forget them for of the things thou writest this is the sum the whole sum of which though pet

belike then according to thy fancy paul when he wrote to timothy to bring his books and cloak left at troas with carpus wrote that not as a matter conceived in his mind or retain'd in his memory but as a thing forgotten that he had no comprehension of did he not write that and a hundred more matters as retain'd in his memory and though he wrote them as mov'd by the spirit in the wisdom of which he liv'd walk't and did all he did as he saw service in it yet did he not write of his revelations and temptations after them by the thorn in the flesh cor
and of his many perils and hazards he had gone through and his whippings and stonings and shipwracks and other sufferings and services cor
as things retained in his memory though some of them fourteen years behinde and when he wrote of the fornication cor
and the divisions cor
that were among the corinthians did he not write of them as things he had by and common report and did he not retain in his memory what was told him by them of the house of cloe and thereupon wrote to them thereof as of a matter heard remembred and believed for partly believe it quoth he and comprehended aforehand vvhat innumerable instances of the like fort of stories written as retained in the memories of holy vvriters might be given out of both the old testament and the new but this little is enough if thou be not wilfully blind to bring thee into a remembrance of thy babling about the bible of the writings whereof thou writest as if thou hadst never read it all but in a dream
and when matthew the publican wrote of his own being called from the receit of custom and of his entertaining christ in his house matth

did he it not on the account of his retaining that passage in his memory

and whereas thou saist they wrote all immediately from god so as that there was onely a passive concurrence of their rational faculties in their reception without any such active obedience as by any law they might be obliged to
say thou renderest thy self as ridiculous reasonlesse in this thy reasoning as if thou wert one that had never read any otherwise then at random for hadst thou been as observans as thou art oscitant in thy readings and writings of the scripture thou wouldst have seen and remembred that several stories proverbs doctrines prophesies and other parcels and passages as they stand recorded in thy rule or canon were not written so immediately from god as thou imaginest that in the first reception as well as in the first scription of some of them there was an active and not onely a passive concurrence of the rational faculties of the writers and also such an active obedience as by some law they might be obliged to


how immediately from god dost thou deem were the writings of sundry of those genealogies in the letter of the iewish law about which there are among many such ministers as thy self such foolish questions and contentions and endless strivings which paul bids those two ministers viz timothy and titus not to give heed to but avoid as unprofitable and vain and fables and things that minister matter of question and vain jangling rather then godly edifying tim

the certainty of all saving doctrine is consequently supposed to be lost say how immediately are these writings and things written from god without any active concurrence of the rational faculties of the writers in the of them may it not very well be supposed that some of these things were written at first if by such holy men as all the iews were not that were very zealous of the letter of the law and in writing the deeds done in their nation yet at least in such wise onely as holy men may without immediate reception of every tittle as thou twatlest they did from god and by the active concurrence of their rational faculties write a story of what is done in their sight or of what they have by or find in the books of the chronicles of things done in such or such nations may it not be supposed that some of those stories and genealogies and chronicles and catalogues and proverbs and prophesies pertaining to the old testament and some of the stories of the new too were written though not without

the spirit moving the holy men to it that liv'd in the spirit yet so as not without a retaining them in their memories and an active concurrence of their rational faculties and such an active obedience as by some law they might be obliged to yea how frivolously foolish art thou in the uttering of thy self is not the very moving of the spirit it self in which thou ownest they wrote and the law of the spirit obliging thereto


and what thinkest thou of the history of iohn mark which some have in that respect stiled sacrum a kind of holy theft is it not possible but that it might be some abbreviation of matthew story concerning christ there being little in it but what is word for word in the other though some ancients have related it to be given forth by peter and by mark onely written from his mouth either of which if it was then was it not so immediately from god as thou i.o guessest as to the writing of it the taking it either out of anothers writing or else from the mouth of another man that had it more immediately then he and yet neither of them so immediately from god as that there was onely a passive concurrence of their rational faculties in the reception of it for whether it were mark writing out of matthew or from peter's mouth or of himself as it seemed good to him to set down twas but a history of such things as he was well acquainted with either as an eye or ear thereof or as one that had it sufficiently attested to for him to undertake to write it out as truth and so not without an active concurrence of his rational faculties in the reception of what he wrote as well as not without a moving thereto by the holy spirit in which he lived and in the light of which he saw it might be serviceable
and on such an account as this rationally reckoning within himself it might be useful so to do luke the physician wrote his two histories of the acts of christ and of his apostles in which book called the acts many if not most of the matters mentioned by him were about paul whose companion he was in several of his travels excepting some passages about the beginning of it concerning all the apostles and some touches concerning barnabas and silas and some others upon occasion of their being here and there with paul in some services but as for the apostles after whom his book is called the acts of the apostles there's scarce the one hundredth part of what they all did nor of those travels and sufferings that they sustained medled with at all by luke who took notice of little more then what he knew as he was a traveller with paul

and that his writings were of no other nature then thus appears plainly by his preface to the first of them which ye call the gospel of st luke where luke
he writes on this wife forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were and ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having had a perfect understanding of things from the beginning to write unto thee in most excellent theophilus that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed
which words many have taken in hand to declare what was delivered to them by the and it seemed good to me also to write to thee sound forth that howbeit the spirit of god might

move him so to do for service sake to the truth yet as others had done before him of whom whether mark were one yea or nay it matters not much to me so himself as it seemed good to him wrote a story of certain truths not upon the account of such a meer passive immediate reception thereof from god by inspiration of every tittle into him as he wrote as thou doest without any conception of the things in his minde or retaining them in his memory or by any means before hand comprehending them but rather as it were at second hand as they were heard and beleeved and by him as true matters of fact from the mouthes or writings of such as were eye witnesses thereof and did first deliver them and so to the confutation of thy vain figment not without a concurrence of his rational faculties in the receiving of what he wrote


what thinkest thou of those proverbs of solomon whose proverbs were
in all not
of which are contained in your canon and his songs a hundred and not five of which are come to your cognizance king

or those which stand in your standard from the very first inserting of them there stand but at second hand at best as they were copied out of whether the first manuscript or some remote and more uncertain transcript who can by the men of hezekiah some nine or ten generations after him see prov
were these received by the writers that affixed them to that ye call your canon so immediately from god as thou dreamest without any but a passive concurrence as things not by any means comprehended by these men of hezekiah before they wrote them
what thinkest thou of such parts and parcels of thy so called canon as are each of them written in two several places or books of thy bible one of which places and the respective parcels whether histories or prophesies or praises therein recited are at most but repetitions and meer transcriptions out of the other with some such additions or ablations or alterations of more than titles and undefined span alphabet as is not unusually made among transcribers of which sort for instance in a few refer thee and all such as scrape so unskilfully as thou doest about the scriptures being in every title as it now stands in your copies immediately written from god by inspiration and without meditation or any means of comprehending the things they wrote beforehand by the writers thereof to consider and compare psal

by which places perused howbeit every word of this is asserted by j.o to be written as immediately from gods own mouth as any of it it is yet plain and evident that some of it was but copied and transcribed out of other some and such a useless repetition of the same over and over again as neither need be nor would be if the bible as consistent of neither more nor less than what is ordinarily bound up in it had intended by either god or the holy of the sundry parcels thereof to be the inalterable constant canon and only steady standard for all succeeding ages of men universally to the worlds end


moreover what thinkest thou of such scripture prophesies and epistles as were first written and pend not by the holy men themselves that were

moved to give them forth by inspiration but by such as wrote them not mmediately from god but from the mouthes of such only as indited them as the spirit moved of which there are not a few but how many exactly who knows since evident it is that those men after whom they are denominated did not at first write all their own prophesies and epistles with their own hands witness much at least of ieremiahs prophesie that was written not by himself but baruch his ordinary scribe as jeremiah dictated to him

which as it contradicts j.o's
talk in the parcel above cited so also it overturns that talk and fabulous piece of praie as to some parts of it and shall here stand as an answer to it which he as ignorantly utters pag
viz
they were carried out by the holy ghost to speake deliver write all that and nothing but that to a very tittle that was so brought unto them they only received the words from god himself every aspect of the written word i.e writing with j.o is equally divine and as immediately from god as the voice wherewith or whereby he spake to or in the prophets and is therefore accompanied with the same authority in it self and unto us
what hath been spoken thus of the scripture of the old testament must be also affirmed of the new with this addition of advantage and preheminen that it received its beginning of being spoken by the lord himself


seeing it is so as is abovesaid that all was not written by the hands of the inspired authors themselves at the very first but much by such scribes only as wrote from them as dictated to by them to whom god gave out this minde and so wrote not so immediately from god as thou dreamest but that they might mispell or mistake in more than titles and undefined span alphabet most good men being but bad schollers and scribes as to inch more humane earthly skill as your schollership lyes in how absolutely doth this overturn that other utter untruths that thou tellest twice over to the manifesting of thine own folly more fully in uttering twice such falshood not so much as once observing it viz pag
that the word which with thee still is the scripture is come forth unto us mark unto us from god without the least mixture or interveniency of any medium obnoxious to fallibility as is the wisdome truth integrity knowledge and memory of the best of all men
but if what have shewed above did not contradict and give check to this saying of thine about the scriptures coming out immediately from god unto us who live so many ages from the last person who received any part of it immediately from god thou whose great masterpiece of business it is throughout thy whole book to say and unsay and contradict thy self and run in rounds overturnest and statly contradictest it thy self saying pag
that we have not the scripture from god immediately our selves in which and contradiction of pag
by pag
thou canst not to continue long neither but as one delighting to dance round and shew how well skill'd thou art in tracing to and fro about the scripture thou to go round again returnest and reiteratest pag
that falsity uttered by thee pag
in this wise over again viz
the scriptures of the old and new testament were immediately and entirely given out by god himself mark as if god himself had wrote it every tittle with his own finger whereas how little god himself wrote have shewed above and how such as were immediately inspired the mediation of whose hand writing in what they also wrote comes between god and us did not write it all immediately with their own hands but men that took what they said from them in writing by the active improvement of their knowledge wisdome skill in writing memory and other rational faculties so far is the text from coming immediately from god to the men of those cities and places that lived where and when it was written but how much farther from being immediately and entirely without any medium obnoxious to fallibility from god to us who live so many ages off unto whom that text j.o talks of is descended perhaps at the hundreth hand through the hands of who knows what unskilful careless forgetful scribes or transcribers the very best of which j.o at best confesses to be but fallible and that it was possible they might and also did mistake so as that failings fell out among them
nevertheless on he goes thus concerning that scripture or writings viz
that gods minde is in them represented unto us without the least interveniency of such mediums and wayes as were capable of giving change or alteration to the least undefined span alphabet or syllable


whereas thou sayest there was onely a passive concurrence of the rational faculties of the writers without any such active obedience as by any law they might be obliged to though have shewed thee that all the

first writers were not inspired but some wrote from their lips that were so and so were though never so skilful obnoxious to fallibility yet as thou intendest it of such prophets apostles evangelists as wrote their own prophesies epistles histories proverbs psalms with their own hands as they were moved by the spirit its utterly untrue that thou affirmest for the holy men of god who either wrote their scripture with their own hands or dictated to such as they required to pen it from their mouthes as themselves spake from the mouth of god out of which came all that wisdome knowledge and understanding that is thereby uttered forth were such as were not so meerly pasive as thou praiest in the reception of what they wrote without any active concurrence of their rational faculties but in order to their receiving the word and manifestation of the minde and will of god to them which was written had both then and long before also an active concurrence thereof and such an active obedience to god as all men are by the law of god i.e the light in the conscience obliged to whereby they were made and became first holy men before they were used by god in such an holy work as preaching and wrriting out his minde to others and were brought into the thing or life it self they spake and wrote of and were purged from lusts and defilements and iniquities and foolish and unlearned questions and such prophane and vain bablings as ye are yet exercised in at your vniversities about the bible as well as about other books of humane businesses that in comparison of that holy truth that is in the bible handled are but meer baubles which a man being purged from tim

he shall be a vessel of honour sanctified and meet for the masters use and prepared unto every good work

yea their prophets that spake out that holy doctrine and truth that is declared in the scriptures what ever some of them might be that were exercised in the copying out of sundry of those to us more unnecessary and unprofitable parts thereof viz the endless legal genealogical chronological catalogues of mens names not so needful to us to know were undefined span alphabet holy men of god pet

ult and such to whose souls knowledge and wisdome and the fear of god was pleasant who cried after it and lifted up their voices to god for it and were in such love with it as to wait on god for it out of whose mouth it comes and daily at the posts of wisdomes house which your vniversities are not yet acquainted with and sought it as silver and searched for it as for hid treasure and though to prophesie was a gift of god and such as have it are so passive as to receive it from the giver and none can receive any thing of it except it be given him from above joh
and though it is in no wise to be purchased by mens mony at schools and colledges as our accademical simon magus's suppose who to obtain and buy all the gifts whereby they prophesie to men for mony and sell them for mony again when they have done yet was it a gift obtained in the way of such active obedience to god as by the said law or light of god in the heart men stand obliged to and to be coveted and desired and was given in a certain way that ye are so far out of that ye hate it of holy waiting on god and learning of him alone in silence in all subjection in order thereunto for which work there are now as there

were of old but those are not oxford and cambridge vniversities as it were schools and nurseries of young prophets at iericho and bethel alias by interpretation the house of god where truth and true wisdom and true religion was and is learnt as truly and fully as it is falsly taught or rather fully and universally forgotten at our now vniversities or of that wisdom and religion from beneath which is but earthly sensual or animal and deceitful see

yea in order to gods manifestation of himself to men in such wise as he will not to world that lyes in wickedness it's required that men keep his commandments so far as they are made known already in the light in the conscience ioh and seperate themselves from the sensual ones that have not the spirit and not together with them from the truth prov
and that they come out of all that defileth and become holy for no defiled thing falls into wisdom but in all ages this as well as any of old though ye own none to be now in rerum natura entring into holy souls she maketh them friends of god and prophets wisd

but the reason why so few priests are ever made true prophets is because for the most part they are more prophane then other people from of old and much more now insomuch that as heretofore mind at present but two of all that numerous tribe race and party of priests that the jewish church was fill'd with that became prophets viz ieremiah and ezekiel ier

in which respect they were false prophets that profited not at all and such as god was against though speaking true words they steal the word they speak out of the true prophets writings whom god sent and spake to when he neither sent nor ever said the same unto them and so run crying thus saith the lord as ours do hear the word of the lord as you shall find it in such a text such a chapter such a verse when they never heard god's voice at any time themselves nor saw his shape
they hate and fight against gods own counsel the light in the conscience which would lead them to purity in their own persons and so never come to see much less to shew his secret which is onely with them that fear him psal
whose sear which is the beginning of wisdom is to depart from the evil which the light discovers and so as none can bring a clean thing out of an unclean so none can receive much of a clean thing into an unclean

so there must be more holiness of truth found among their holinesses the pope and all the priests and praters for pay thorowout all christendom before they know how to prophesie themselves or tell truly as much as they are found from the text of their transcripts tatling to the world of what they know not how and in what manner gods prophets prophesie

that in writing they were not enabled by any habitual light knowledge or conviction of truth to declare gods mind and will but onely acted as they were immediately moved by him their hand in what they wrote was no more at their own disposal then the pen in the hand of an expert writer
and
that no rational apprehensions had any place in their writing
and
that this was the first spring of the scripture and beginning of its emanation from the counsel of god it was brought by the power of the holy ghost into its organs and instruments us'd for the declaration of it and that it was not left to their understandings wisdoms minds memories to order dispose and give it out
but that they were born acted moved to write all and nothing but that to every tittle that was so brought to them
and that they invented not words themselves but the words were immediately supplyed to them and that in writing they were but passive instruments for the reception and representation of words and that every apex of the written word i.e writing secundum te was as immediately from god to the writers as his voice in the prophets
and
that they were but as an instrument of musick giving a sound according to the hand onely of him that strikes it
rep these things are false being written by thee of all the writings and first writers of the scripture universally as they are without exception and distinction for so indistinct and confused art thou in thy delivery of thy mind about the bible that though it be a bulk of heterogeneous writings compiled together by men taking what they could find of the several sorts of writings that are therein and trussing them all up into one crouding them into a canon or standard for the trial of all spirits doctrines truths and by them alone yet thou speak'st so homogeneously of it as if whatever can be predicated of any may be as properly predicated of it all yea whatever thou sayest falsly of the writing thou denominatest the of it all and every apex and tittle yea every tittle and iota with thee is no less then the word of the great god wherein the concernment of souls lyes
and so every part of it a rule and the perfect rule for so twas with thee when there were none but moses five books and tis but so with thee now so much is added so every apex equally divine and as immediately from god as any of it yea and as the voice whereby he spake in the prophets pag

but say as written by thee so universally of the writers and meer writing of the scriptures as they are they are for the most part as false as that foregoing and that have said above concerning the writing of much of the scripture at first as it stands in your bibles by scribes that wrote either out of other copies or from the mouths of men more immediately inspired or from what was commonly reported and generally believed and what they had heard as delivered to them by more immediate eye and ear witnesses and

what they retain'd in their memories and some way or other comprehended beforehand may stand as a sufficient answer to this parcel also wherein according to thy wonted habitual darkness ignorance and contradiction to the truth thou deniest the and holy prophets in their writings to be enabled to declare and write what they wrote by any habitual light knowledge or conviction of the truth as if they wrote what they neither saw nor heard nor knew nor believed to be true but besides all sight and understanding discerning mental conception meditation rational apprehension faith or any manner of antecedent comprehension of the truths they told as if they were all acted and us'd in the writing of every tittle by the lord just no otherwise but as a musical instrument in a man's hand or the pen itself by an expert writer which can yeeld no more then a meer passive concurrence having no principle of life within it self from whence to act any thing at all or to move a hairs breadth in any business but as it's mov'd or as some stark dead corps which can neither stir nor stand but as extrinsecally born up and carried forth because deest aliquid intus whereas as have shew'd above some of them wrote not by immediate inspiration or bringing of the things into their minds so by the spirit but mediately that is from the mouths or writings of such as received the truths more immediately as they were inspired wrote as they also spake no other things then what by some means or other they beforehand comprehended no other then what they heard and saw and believed and retained in their minds and memories whereinto the spirit of truth and the truths he guided them into which the world receives not were both received conceived and entertained yea and here add no other then such as in the same light were more or less seen known understood and believed before any scripture at all was though twas by the same way then which know no other that the scripture speaks of of knowing god or christ viz of internal spiritual revelation matth

whereas most evident it is that the holy men of god who wrote any part of the scripture by immediate inspiration with their own hands to let pass that which some wrote for and from them as dictated to by their mouthes were in the light sight knowledge comprehension beleef and acknowledgement of the truth habitually and were thereby inabled to declare it and from thence did declare it accordingly as in the wisdome of the spirit they saw it serviceable and as by it they were moved so to do
am not ignorant that they were undefined span alphabet and as so undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet divinely inspired and as so infallible and acted born carried by the holy spirit in what they spake and wrote about which matters what a mighty marvelling and hideous ditty and wonderful deal of do doth j.o make in his muddy minde of which since he is so amazed that any such matter should be so much as pretended to in those dayes may likely speak more particularly in another place

but what of all this because they were undefined span alphabet moved by the holy spirit in what they did will it therefore follow

they were meerly passive in their work without any such active obedience as was in the light required of them and without any exercise at all save such as was passive of their rational faculties therein without being inabled by any habitual light or use of their own understanding wisdome memories or the like in any writings of what they so wrote as if they actively entred no more than stocks and stones into the services they were set on work in surely though they were instruments and organs into which the word was brought by the spirit as they waited on the lord for the revelation and manifestation of it to them yet they were living organs and instruments not only to the natural but also to that supernatural or spiritual life of god the things of which they wrote and declared and so were as it were subordinate efficients and inferiour agents concurring by the use and exercise of their reason and rational faculties which grace and the spirit of god perfects heightens and delivers from the defects therein contracted by transgression and doth not destroy

and howbeit deny not still but that the prophets that pend any scripture were passive as said before in the reception of the minde of god manifested to them in the light so far as the receiver of a gift is to the giver from whom he can command nor have nothing unless it be given him and were no otherwise active than as beggars who are not to be chusers waiting at the door of wisdom and on god in the light within to see what he will give and in order to the obtaining it yet when the light and word was given out they were so far active so all are not whereupon many go without it as waiters are when they receive what is given and also far active as according to the measure of the gift of grace or knowledge received when the spirit moved them so to do to go forth and minister either by preaching or writing or what way they found their call to serve in some one way some another and every individual sometimes one way sometimer another as paul said rom
having gifts differing according to the grace given whether prophesis let us prophesie according to the proportion of faith i.e each his own proportion and measure not as you divines who have a common analogy of faith or stock of unsavoury divinity among you according to which ye minister or ministry let us wait on our ministring or he that teacheth on teaching or exhorteth on exhortation which things whether done by voice or writing is all one they were not to do but as the spirit moved or acted them yet in both were they not only acted by the spirit but subordinately active with him in those several ministrations as good stewards of the manifold grace of god speaking ministring whether in speech or scripture as the oracles of god in all faithfulness which is required in stewards cor

who though it is their master that doth all supremely by them and acts by them and speaks and writes and manages all affairs by their ministration as the spirit of the father doth in his saints and children yet by his power and the gift of his grace received in the juncture and very period of receiving of which they were passive they concurred actively in the work of writing as the saints do in the working out of their own salvation when god hath once wrought in them to will and to do of his own good pleasure phil

so that of the most immediate writers of the scriptures from the mouth of god it might be said

as it is of all saints licetnec per se operantur nec aequaliter yet aliqualiter saltèm etiam activè concurrunt cum causa operante they wrought and wrote neither wholly of themselves nor equally with the spirit yet even actually concurred with him in the act of writing so as a pen or musical instrument doth not which is not subjectum capax a subject capable to act or move actively in the works of man any more than a stone can concur actively to the throwing of it self

and being though but organs or instruments as thou sayest the prophets were into whom the words they wrote were brought yet sith living organs or instruments alive to god by participation of his divine nature to the things of that life and nature they were consequently active organs and instruments and subordinate agents and efficients and as well willingly acting as acted therein in the day of gods power wherein his people are a willing people as dead organs and instruments cannot be
for sith vita est actus corporis organici quatenus organicum life of every kinde is no less than an act or operative power of every thing that hath it to act or work such actions as are agreeable to its nature the life of god in such as by the light of christ in whom is the life and whose life is the light of men joh

are led and born thereunto is an act or spiritual operative power to do and perform such actions as are suitable to man before he dyed by transgression and according to the will of god revealed as posita anima in corpore organico quâ tali sequitur vita posita vitâ sequitur operatio motio naturalis so posito spiritu in animâ recipiente sequitur vita actio spiritualis

so the holy men that wrote the scripture as undefined span alphabet inspired and moved by the holy spirit which brought the truth unto them he pressed them to write were not according to j.o's vain figment of them undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet acted and hurried like some stone thrown or pen handled which is meerly and only passive in what is done but acted as all saints are in their measures to that of writing his truth or any other good work when called by him to it i.e not without but with such an active obedience as by his law or light within they are obliged to not without an active concurrence of rational faculties reduced to their primitive perfection not without but with ability thereto from an habitual light knowledge and conviction of truth and use of their wisdomes and understandings memories not without but with an aforehand containing and comprehending of the truths they wrote in their mindes as things they had heard seen beleeved acknoledged god who who is the giver of every good gift and the chief author and actor of all good works in his saints isa
using every instrument according to what he hath fitted it for a beast as a beast a man as a man a saint as a saint a prophet as a prophet and not a man a saint a prophet a spiritual man as a stock or stone but being a reasonable creature and prepared by him naturally with such a soul such faculties and supernaturally and spiritually with such gifts and graces as whereby he is capable to act when by him commanded and a body suitable as a fit instrument to move in such a work as writing his will revealed when it is revealed also to be his will that he should write it he uses him so to write as

that though himself be the principal or primum movens not only in primo as he gives the pomer faculties gift graces but in actu secundo also he holds the hand of the so that he would else draw but mishapen characters and guides assists and acts in and by him yet he lets the action bear its denomination from its next and immediate agent which is not god himself who gives the word for the writing of what he will have written in the penning of the scripture except that little i.e the ten words as is abovesaid but men as being moved by him to write or to dictate to others whom they willed to write from their mouthes so that the immediate spring and emanation of the scripture was not from god but men who were the agents in it under him which overturns j.o's apish opinion of every apex of the writing being equally divine and as to its original as immediately from god and of the same authority in itself and to us of being received as his word sub paena on pain of peril of eternal condemnation as his voice in the prophets which indeed was immediately from himself and his own witness whereas the letter was mostly but the immediate work of man witnessing for god as moved by him as first given out and as we now have it by so remote away of transcription welnigh as far from being immediately from god to us as j.o imagines it is undefined span alphabet

and as it is with saints indeed when they pray beleeve preach write as moved by the lord it is not denominated ever by the author of it all which is god who speaks and works all in such and is in such of a truth cor
but the saints who are said to pray beleeve preach write so was it in the giving out of that scripture or writing that was of old called the bible which j.o calls his canon to which no title more must ever be counted which was not nor is not so immediate from god to us as his own voice is that is at this day to be heard in the heart but onely mediantibus manuscriptionibus yea by the interveniency of mediums and hands of transcribers and translators obnoxious to fallibility and capable to give change and alteration in more then the least syllables and undefined span alphabet]'s but at the first it was no more immediately from god than the writings of his moved and inspired prophets are at this day whom he stirs up to reprove the madness of the priests and false prophets which is as that was but the spiritual mans testimony for god though specially assisted by him in it concerning all whom from the beginning of the world to this day so many as have spoken or written or done any thing for the truth in his name here say and so conclude as to that above

their mind and understanding were used in the choice of words they did use undefined span alphabet words of will or choice
i.o to go round again this latter saying by which he had once the former returning to his former again ex

where his latine words englisht are in this foolish wise viz to express the sence they conceived of the mind and will of god the words in those tongues in which by the command and ordination of god the scripture is written were both conceived and disposed by the holy spirit and not permitted or left to the wisdom and will or arbitrement of the writers themselves

so of this sound piece of round doctrine of i.o this is the sum they that wrote the scripture did not invent chuse or seeke words nor was it left to their minds understandings will wisdoms to express the truth yet to go round again they did use words of will or choice their mind and understanding were used in the choice of words yet to go round again to express the will and mind of god the words were not left to the will and wisdom of the writers

after the salvation and the grace that comes unto the saints at the revelation of christ but is there no searching and enquiring after the salvation and the fulness of the grace of god but the letter is not the most succesful searching after these matters made in the light it self that teaches and shews it and brings the salvation nigh to all that wait for it therein which light or grace hath appeared to all men tit

and as for daniel it is true he understood by the books of jeremiah the number of seventy years how long the captivity should last but what of that num ex puris particularibus aliquid sequit universale wilt thou argue from one to all much more wilt thou infer from thence that neither daniel nor any other prophets understood their own writings but by the scriptures of the other prophets which is the absurdity thou assertest and as for davids saying through thy precepts get understanding

sundry other such shallow furmises and suppositions are very positively propounded and set down by thee in thy first chapter of thy first treatise which shall let pass here some of which may possibly be touch't on elsewhere but this may suffice to give a taste of that untruth which thy two treatises are with whereby from the falsenesse faultinesse foolishnesse and unsoundness of thy and foundation and from the brittleness of thy basis so thou call'st
this original part of thy book concerning the divine original and immediate manner of the scriptures coming forth from god to us the reasonable reader may read aforehand what a castle the rest of thy babylonish building is like to be for howbeit grant that the word of god and the holy truth in its first coming forth from god to the holy that heard his voice and so wrote it as moved by him was of an immediate divine original in which respect it is said no prophesie of the scripture is of private interpretation or to be counted no more upon than a private mans which writes of his own head as thou dost the figment and imagination of whose heart fancies thoughts are the fountain of all that is uttered but as that which holy men of god were moved to write and the outward scripture it self may be said to be undefined span alphabet i.e penned by men as they were inspired by god or the fruit and effect of no but according to the motion or inflation of the holy spirit yet that undefined span alphabet thou makest such a deal of work about as the original of the copies of the original of the scripture and their coming forth from god was not so immediately from god to those that lived when they were first given out much less to us now as thou imaginest in thy vain mind who dotest that every apex of that text is equally divine and as immediately from god to us as the very voice of god in the prophets was to them without the least mixture or interveniency of any mediums or wayes obnoxious to fallibility or capable of giving change or alteration to the least undefined span alphabet or syllable thereof pag
for that came from god at first excepting the decalogue and that little to belshazzar which ye have now but remote copies of not without the interveniency medium and way of mans which is it were as being infallibly guided by the spirit obnoxious to no fallibility yet as it comes to you who own that and no other to be your inalterable standard its far from coming immediately from god sith it is not without the interveniency of the hands of welnigh innumerable unknown transcribers the very first and best of whom were so far from to fallibility that thou thy self sayest pag
that neither all nor any of them were undefined span alphabet infallible or divinely inspired so that it was impossible for them to mistake and that religious care and diligence in their works with a due reverence of him with whom they had to do is all thou ascribest to them and
that the wisdome truth integrity knowledge and memory of the best of all men is obnoxious fallibility and also that its known they did fail

neither if the question were about the autographae or first manuscripts that were far more immediate then thy far fetcht apographae or modern copies

are howbeit thy main business is about the magnifying thy confestedly mistranscribed transcripts and fallible copies and not the other which being acknowledged by thee to be lost perished and mouldred out of the world nemo post homines natos aequè ac tu delerasse censendus esset si pro scripturis ipsis scriptis hisce argumentare statueris thy dotage would justly be deemed of a deeper die than any mans to argue for them if he be a fool of al fool that for the of what is long since corrupted but say were thy vehement vindication and apologetical appearances pro scripturis for the individual manuscripts of the holy men that wrote the minde of god more immediately from his mouth than any of thy transcribers that copy out things as carefully as they can as they find them copied out before them and were they still extant in rerum natura yet the immediacy even of those first scriptures from god to us was not so absolute without any medium at all as thou imaginest and intimatest from the used by thee and ushered in with such a deal of pomp and ceremony in proof thereof
viz pet
knowing this that no prophesie of scripture is of any private for the prophecy came not of old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost

this thou writest all over in greek first then in english and then descantest paraphrastically upon it in many pages as if thou wouldest beat thy beleef upon men and cudgel them into thy conceit of the scriptures being as immediately from god to us in every apex as his voice by which he spake in the holy men that wrote it was in them and that assuredly beyond all doubt or exception because peter sayes no prophecy of scripture is of private nor came by mans will but gods and holymen spake us moved by his spirit yea pag
thou runst away an end it with it as an undoubted truth and layest it down as it were supernaculum undefined span alphabet knowing judging determining this in the first place this is a to be owned and acknowledged by every one that will beleeve any thing else
this then in our religion is to be owned acknowledged submitted unto as a principle without further dispute that this is so indeed as before asserted and to give a reason why this to be received as a principle it is added vers
undefined span alphabet the word of prophecy is not undefined span alphabet of private acceptation for it came not was brought into them not at any time by the will of men but by the will of god and further it is added by the apostle undefined span alphabet they were acted born carried out to speak deliver write all that and nothing but that to every tittle that was so brought to them by the holy ghost

what a pompous piece of proof here is of the scriptures coming from god to us disht out with great store of circumstance having no substance or purport at all in it to the purpose in hand for however j.o cannot discern how to distinguish between these two terms viz undefined span alphabet prophecy of the scripture and the scripture of the prophecy the changeable text and unchangeable truth the meer and the holy matter yet peter speaks not there of the scripture which comes to us

immediately from men writing not in their own wills but at the will of god as moved by his spirit but of the prophecy thereof which we confess came immediately from god to the holy men of god and to others mediately not without the intervenieny of their of it sat sapienti insipiensi plura plus satis

neither doth that undefined span alphabet thou makest such work about elsewhere viz
in a case somewhat consonant with this urging out of tim

undefined span alphabet necessarily intimate such an absolute immediacy of the outward text from god as thou wotest for as there is undefined span alphabet a writing or scripture that is more ad intra than the writing extra legible by the external eye which thy minde and eyes are altogether a gadding after as if there were no other viz undefined span alphabet a scripture written not with inke but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart cor
which whether paul to timothy doth not speak of as that which he had known from his youth and was able to make him wise to salvation and as being by the inspiration of god and profitable to the perfecting of them in of god to furnish him for doctrine reproof instruction inrighteousness and work is well worth your serious enquiry who search so shallowly into the scripture that ye seldome meet with the marrow and true mystery of any text yé talk ón so if you will needs have that undefined span alphabet to intend the external text only as being by inspiration of god yet that phrase undefined span alphabet or by inspiration from god doth not denote necessarily the strictest degree of immediation nor can it found out so much as if the said outward letter came from him without any medium but it came as tis in the other place pet

according to the will of god from men moved by him to write it so according to the motion of gods spirit or his inflations or blowings upon the hearts of holy men not without the interveniency of their hands in the penning of it or the hands of such as penned it from their mouthes as they spake the truths thereof who received them from the mouth of god speaking in them
thus though the first manuscripts had as immediate a divine original and emanation from god as any outward writings in the world yet that they had so immediate an emanation as thou wouldest make them have as if every apex thereof is as immediate from god to you as his voyce was from him to the prophets in whom he spake that excepting the little that is above excepted is utterly false and as for your transcripts which thy talk is so transcendent for though they are immediate to you because they come to you as the first manuscripts never did yet they came not immediately from god at all but from the hands of fallible men so little guided in their writing from the infallible spirit that by thy own confession they being without that both might and did fail and mistake therein

and now how little all this first chapter hath in it where with to make a sound or firm basis for the bearing up of so great a babel as thou

buildest on it viz
such a divine authority of the scripture as whereby it claims and challenges the high and glorious title of the word of god to it self and every tittle of it under pain and peril of all mens perishing for ever that ownit not as such and honor it not as thou dost whose grand idol the meer outward text is with that divine honour that is due to the inward true eternal incorruptible inalterable powerful living word of god it self which it only is but a bare though true relation of comes now to be considered

and many more such transcendently glorious epethites and compellations thou denominatest the scripture by as that which as to the integrity of the text is unaltered in every tittle and also every tittle and iota of which is a part of the word yea the word of the great god wherein the eternal concernment of souls lyes for of the scripture or under that terme of scripture or of the word thou restisiest all this yea and very much more dost thou found out and sing of the transcripts of the greek and hebrew text to the same tune which though they are all true of the true word of god indeed which is properly so called and in the scripture it self which never which no where calls it self so is often and only so stiled yet being by thee uttered all concerning the scripture which is intended by thee when thou praedicarest any thing of it under that name or term of the word of god

saying the word of god is a light powerful glorious above the sun as well as when thou speakest of it under its own true and only proper name of scripture saying the scripture is the rule the foundation the scripture is so or so it is every whit of it utterly false as thou utterest it the falsehood whereof shall now come to make some animadversions of more particularly

and for as much as own all those glorious denominations thou runnest out into to be true to a tittle if spoken of gode word indeed but deny utterly the truth of any one of them as they are spoken by thee of the scripture as the most commodious way that can take for the disproof of thy untrue talke of the scriptures whereby thou ignorantly not to say idolatrously attributest such glorious titles and epechites thereunto as are the due and only peculiar properties of the true and living word of god indeed which is christ jesus himself and also for the vindication of the word of god from that robbery and spoil that is done to it by thee who pullest it down from the throne and statest the meer texs and letter of it in its place and also for the further vindication of the poor deluded fanatical qua as thou callest them in whom thou foolishly fanciest satan assaults the sacred truth of the word of god in its authority purity integrity and against whose abominations as thou sayest in thy epistles thou subjoyned thy latine theses in the close of the other treatises for the instruction of the younger sort of students to whom thou dedicatest thy dribling doings and for the clearing of the qua in their principles from thy shallow rash censure of them as being therein confused opposers of the truth shall endeavour to comprize the whole truth not only about the word of god but also about the scripture of it as to name and thing most miserably mistaken by thy poor deluded self in this one general argument the minor proposition whereof being plainly proved to be true in each particular of it for the major is not only undeniable but also undenied or rather absolutely affirmed by thy self the conclusion which is perfectly contradictory to the main matter and principal contended for throughout thy book viz
that the scriptures known to be the word of god and that is the proper name thereof will necessarily follow as true to its full and final confutation and overturning
the argument is on this wise

the word of god is the most stedfast relief against uncertainty and confusion the firm foundation the most perfect rule of all faith and obedience that god requires at hands the most effectual means of bringing men to repentance and which immediately it is to be grounded upon the chiefest among all wayes of coming to the knowledge of gods minde and will the truest touchstone stable standard lydius lapis that gives determination of doctrines by which all is to be examined and proved necessary to beget and increase faith perfect in its integrals the most glorious spiritual light in the world above the sun the witness of god the very doctrine of god the power of god to salvation the powerful living quickning word of god that which challengeth that glorious title to its self as it own proper name that which evidenceth manifests and testifies of it self to be the word of god and is so stiled welnigh a thousand times in the scripture to be received as such on peril of eternal ruine every tittle of which is the word of

god the great god in which the eternal concernment of souls doth lye and such other things as j.o denominates the scripture by
but the scripture is none of all this therefore the scripture is not the word of god much less known so to be nor so properly to be called

that the scripture is none of all that which thou testifiest above that it is and which no qua do deny the word of god to be is the business which now lyes before me to make good in order whereunto shall take the several particulars into examination and make some animadversion of what thou sayest in proof of those particulars in the affirmative affirming that not the scripture but the light the letter came from is the only most stedfast relief against contentious confusions darkness and uncertainties
thou sayest indeed the scripture is the stedfast relief against all that uncertainty darkness confusion
that the mindes of men heightned by the unspeakable alterations that are found among them run out into
but say not blaming the scripture as the cause of it which is holy just and good when wise men have the handling of it that throw the doting disputers of this world about it who in their wrangling mindes and restless pens wrest the writings of it to their own and the worlds ruine the scripture canoniz'd by men as their rule of faith is become as the gospel of peace is of war to the lewd mindes the occasion or causa sine qua non of all the confusion darkness uncertainty which by the vanity folly and loosness of mens mindes drawn out a whoring after the letttr without from the light and spirit within by divine dotages on it and dim divinations out of it for means and the unspeakable alterations of it and endless enmities and hatreds and envyings one of another about their own sottish senses and mishapen meanings on it hath too certainly been heightened and is already long since run out into

yea the scripture as canoniz'd into an authentick common standard to themselves stands but as truncus locorum a certain topick or common place from whence to scrue arguments to the assaulting one of another and from which to fetch fuell to feed the fire of their wrathful and hellish life of disputing out their giddy guessings to each other so nauseously that some saints have been weary of the world and wisht to be out of it upon nothing more than a desire to be rid of the angry direful doings and divisions of the men called divines which topick of theirs too they chop to

pieces and criticize into such crums and bits the better to beat one another out of and about it that as the oxonians used to say of ramus in tot ramos ramulos ramusculos locorum hunc truncum dividit
so may say of all our admired erasmus's or supposedly learned divines that either hate or dote on each others divinity doings of the best of whom when all is done as renouned as they seem to themselves can say no better yet such dunces are they in the school of christ than can of erasmus himself of whom as to the things of god were he now living it might be said

that were they as truly built on the letter of scripture as they deem themselves to be and it's most sure to some and infallibly true they are all beside it yet being not on the light they are no better bottom'd then on the sand trusting also as said above that when the holy thieves that steal the word they speake from one another to make a trade on and the scribes have done scolding and scuffling together about the scriptures then there wil be a restitution to every thing that hath been robb'd thereof of its own proper name viz
of the rule to the rule of the foundation to the foundation of the light to the light of the witnesse of god to the witnesse of god of the living word to the living word of god and of the bare writing text or letter to the letter and no more which in truth is no more then plainly so

so then as positive as thou art in it i.o that the outward writing the close of the canon of which as to any more immediate revelation of his will was immediately given out from god to us as a continent of the whole of his mind and will as a merciful and stedfast relief against all confusion darkness uncertainty loosenesse of mens minds ut supra and as it were a certain standard to hush all controversies yet who affirm the inward light vvord and spirit of god in the heart so to be do deny that the whole scripture how immediately soever it had its being and beginning of god and however some little of it was act

was ever designed by him to such an end as the ending of strifes and contention or determining of all doubts and questions and disputings about his mind and will among men or that it ever prov'd succesful or effectual to such an end or else ut frustrâ est ista potentia quae ne unquaem reducitur in actum sic frustra istud medium quod nunquam obtinere potest suum finem
as that's a vain power which never produces its effect so that's a vain means and therefore not so intended of god who appoints no means utterly in vain which never can obtaine its own end

nay verily though miserable man for his own ends cryes it up into that supremacy sets it up as the ensign to the nations in which he would have them put their trust that it will end and amend all matters that are out of tune in the world about truth and is a stedfast relief against all that fighting andabatarum mors in their dark mindes that is among the clergy of all kinds and colours papists prelates presbyters who all three like ammon moab and mount seir making one head against the people of god do yet destroy each other and non secus as sampsonis vulpeculae like sampson's foxes burn up the churches true as if

such were the plenitudo scripturarum the sufficiency power and perfect efficacy of the scripture that if men will come all to a tryal of doctrines faiths spirits and all by that tanquam ad lydium lapidem then all differences and dissentions in religion of whatsoever sorts must cease and all the most detestable errors which flying the scripture men are divided into must extempore vanish upon their looking there

yet till men come to turn to the light and word within which is the power of god the scriptures tells of which who erres from and are ignorant of as the schollars and scribes are more then any do erre not knowing the scripture they scribble on any more then it the letter is too weak an engine to set to rights what's what's out of order and a standard which men that lean to it as to that intent find to be but a broken staff that not onely fails their expectation of support from it but also wounds them more and runs into their hands witnesse the wosul work that the worlds ministers make in it for all their scripture who for and about the scripture and their sundry silly senses about it self and meanings made of the holy matter that's plainly made out in it make more havock of whole nations by stirring them up to war about the scripture in their wild wisdom wicked wils then ever could have been in christendom if the scripture had never been among them at all what wasting devastations and calamity hath been in germany not onely betwixt protestants and papists but also by protestants i.e lutherans and calvinists within themselves and wherefore but for their divided thoughts upon some few texts of scripture and what errors heresies straglings from the truth which is but one and from the true light the scripture calls to did ever any sorts of erring men among whom the clergy that commonly cryed whore first have been the chief run out into error in the christian world who have not pretended at least to own and to be willing to be tryed also by the scripture yea the papists for all their infallible chair will and do ever when they plead it against protestants professe pretensively to prove it by the scripture having a sense for every place to serve their own turns as the protestant clergy to serve their turns have another

and howbeit it hath been thought in the protestant part of europe that all would be unity it self among them and so tis as to make one against the pope since men fell from that infinity of imagination and invention which was and was capable to be eternally fed with the endless fuel which the unerring breast and boundless treasure of tradition could easily finde for it and betook themselves more singly to the scriptures marching from rome under the conduct of the purity of the originals as thou speakest of the scritures yet what multiplication of divisions for want of coming to the light which is but one in all and in which alone all true unity is had and held with god and one another ioh
rather then any diminution thereof hath fell out in your reformed churches as ye call them all the

scriptures being so all in all among them so that like the serpent hydraus hundred heads whereof when hercules cut off one two grew up after it in the place as soon as one controversie among the reform'd clergy was hoped to be ended though know none was ever truly ended yet by all the synodical designs that ever were on foot in this nation or any other so that we may truly say of every synod of divines that hath yet fate

quis synodus nodus patrum chorus integer aeger conventus ventus sessio stramen amen

many new ones began that like new fresh hares starting upon tired hounds that have been hot in the old sent have run them all out of breath or if any evil of division in one thing hath been put to an end it hath been but a preparative to a greater breach among the protestant clergy and all their creatures and still finis alterius mali gradus est futuri yea may say of thy scriptures as thou pleads for them j.o to end all strife withall as may say of our english oaths impos'd upon poor persons to the impeaching themselves when they come before our crooked courts in case of tythes viz that the oaths given on pretence of ending all strife are in truth given by the judges to begin all strife with for if an honest man will not swear how many eggs and pigs and pears and plumbs he hath had for so many years past they will not permit him to plead at all or strive in his own defence against his persecutor
in like manner it is with that which thou exhibit'st to men in order to the ending all divisions and disputes viz the meer looking beside the light within into the letter of the scriptures which is so far from finishing any strife that it feeds vain foolish loose mindes such as thine that hates the light none else with fuel and furnishes their fancies with matter for many more strifes then they would find cause for if they kept to the light within alone for their learning or at least so as in that alone to look into the letter where such as learn at the light may read their own
yea dark minds diving into the scripture divine lyes enough out of it to set whole countreys on fire as the divines have ever done
and as to the purity of the originals under the conduct of which thou saist ye went from rome wishing none may return thither under pretence of their corruption
say the purity of them which thou pleadest in that height thou dost is but pretended and that more or less corrupted they are to the contradicting thy self thy self art forced to confess
as is shewed above but be they as they are or how they will be pure or not pure to a tittle as thou assertest them they are so far from relieving you in your wearisom wrathful strifes that cum nemini obtrudi potest itur ad me may your original text say when the divines can have leisure to cease a little from their strife about the holy matter and doctrine of it then rather then sit still and be quiet or be idle from their common calling which is contention they'l role sysiphus his stone and be at wars and tear one another about the very letter and their original transcripts of it and try that out tooth and nail whether they be true or no in every letter tittle point and iota as they were written as the first

yea curas hominum though for truth and wisdom and the scriptures sake which own and honour as holy just and good and of precious use to such as know and obey the truth am become such a fool with them by answering them according to their folly as to make this one among them about the scripture that may bring some of them to the truth and light of god in them in which only the union is that they may cease henceforth from their stirs strifes which light til they turn to testifie to them that their way is as slippery places in the dark in which they will be driven on till they fall therein that their feet are swift to shed blood that wasting and misery are in their wayes and the way to true peace they know not yet this one thing must say too and of our vniversity scriblers pro scripturis that as there are no men in the world more up to the ears in strife about the scripture and their own fancies on it as to matter and letter than the scribes are so there is no one thing that the scribes are striving scuffling and scolding at each other more about than about their scriptures

that light or word within and not the letter is the foundation
first shall take account of what thou falsely assertest concerning the scriptures being a foundation
thou affirmest the scriptures to be the foundation of the prophets and apostles spoken of eph

the foundation of all that faith and obedience which he requires at our hands
and page
the great and blessed foundation of truth
all this own to be very true of the word of god of which the scripture speaks but it is utterly false as uttered by thee of the scriptures
the falsehood of which appears plainly by this argument

argument that which is the great and blessed foundation of all that truth faith hope and obedience that god requires at mens hands and of the church and of the apostles and prophets must be something which was in being before any of these things were for the foundation on which these are built must have a being before they can be built thereupon every foundation being before the building can stand upon it
but though the word of god be so yet the scripture is not before but long after that truth faith hope and obedience which god requires at mens hands and long after the church and long after the apostles and prophets were yea after those apostles and prophets were respectively who were the respective thereof
therefore the scripture the writing the letter the greek and hebrew text is not the foundation of any of these things

the first proposition is so true that it were no less then disparagement to i.o's wisdom to suppose him to be mentis inops to go about to prove it to

him sith as he builds castles in the air as easily thrown down as erected upon no better foundation then his own fancy thoughts conjectures and imaginations yet he cannot be so senceless as to think that that foundation be it what it will firm or brittle on which any thing is built must be before the building can stand thereon

and as for the minor in every part thereof it's as undeniably true to any save such as having once turn'd their backs upon the truth are resolved to render themselves devoid of eithet sense or reason in their reasonings against it then to own it
for none else can deny but the church and the truth faith hope and obedience of it and the messengers apostles prophets preachers of righteousnesse such as were enoch noah abraham lot and others were in the truth faith hope obedience of the gospel and also built upon christ the light the word of god the rock of ages before moses dayes who is unversally supposed at our vniversities to have been the first of the scriptures

the grand master of scripture that is us'd in proof hereof that the scriptures are the foundation is ephes

where it's said by paul to the ephesians ye are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets iesus christ himself being the chief
hence it is strenuously stickled for and as confidently as cloudily concluded by our doting doctors and dreaming divines that the church of god as to all her faith hope obedience knowledge of the truth is built upon the apostles and prophets writings as that which is there called the foundaeion whereas were they but at leisure from that lesser and lower literature wherein they are lost from the lord and the light and life of god and the letter also which issued forth from thence to look into the light and by it into the letter it self they more blindly labour for then truly learn by they would soon see that the foundation of the apostles and prophets there spoken of is not the apostles and prophets themselves much less uncertain transcribed copies of those few fragments of their letters and some other honest mens true stories of what was done in their times good instructions memorandums and litteral recommendations of wholsome laws and statutes most of which as laid down in the letter saving that they remain in the truth and substance whereof they were the types figures and shadows are above since cancelled and abolished promises prophesies psalms proverbs parables occasional letters epistles and other writings which such as fell into a foolish following and falling down before outward images and from the infallible spirit it self that their scriptures were written to keepe men to found and fardelled together and fram'd in their own fancies into a foundation of the faith and of all the whole fabrick of religion to be for ever framed and founded upon but christ iesus himself who is there also called the chief and pet

and that it is christ iesus alone and not the scriptures that is there call'd the foundation is most evident not onely from the text it self wherein jesus christ himself is instanced in as such for the same that is call'd the foundation is there also call'd the but also from other scriptures whereby the truth hereof is yet more illustrated viz isa
where speaking both in the foregoing and following verses of the false foundations short beds narrow coverings and lying refuges that the drunkards of ephraim that erred from the simple plain truth thorow the wine of their own wisdom and were out of the way and stumbled in wisdom and iudgement thorow the strong drink of their own devised doctrines so that they could not discern nor learn the lords doctrine that was divined to them thorow the stammering lips of such as ministred precept upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little among them he summons all to fix their faith on the one onely true and firm foundation saying behold lay in sion for a foundation a stone a tryed stone a precious a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste where it's very observable as it is in eph

yet alas poor deluded man j.o thou mistakest thy self exceedingly it would be well for thee indeed if thou held'st the foundation christ the head the light of men thy person might then be saved though thy work of wood hay stubble will assuredly perish in the fire but thou art far from being found holding that foundation then which there is no other and found laying another even thy uncertain transcripts of the greek and hebrew texts and an outward fallible letter and its points and syllables and tittles and iota's one jot or tittle of which if it fail thou confessest all thy faith and fabrick of religion falls to the ground confessing also that twas not impossible for the chiefest transcribers thereof to mistake in any thing yea that they did fail in their work so rasing thy false feigned and fallible foundation to the ground and pulling down thy house with thy own hands like the foolish woman and as for the true foundation christ the light and spirit which are infallible stable firm fixt sure and certain as every true laid foundation ought to be and is though thy flexible letter is not so which is of it self an argument of its not being the churches foundation of faith and obedience this true one say is by thee trampled on and flouted at under the names of nescio quod lumen quem deum seu undefined span alphabet deo quopiam melius merae tenebrae aecitas fines salutares quod attines non sufficiens ad salutem christus fanaticorum imaginarius fictitius qualitas nescio quae divina seu anima mundi omnibus misia quae undefined span alphabet sit i.e vere nihil ex

know not what divine quality or soul of the world made up of all things that is all things and truly nothing

moreover if none can lay other foundation then christ then paul himself by these words ephes

ye are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets cannot rationally be concluded as he is both senselesly and reasonlesly conceived by i.o to intend any other foundation then christ himself neither can he be understood by any that have common understanding to intend himself and other prophets and apostles or his own and their meer outward writings for then there are two whereof they must have one foundation of faith and obedience and we another they christ the light and we them and their letter which is an absurdity utterly unbecoming men call'd christs ministers to imagine seeing the foundation quicquid id est of the church and her faith hope and obedience from the beginning of the world to this day is but one and not many yea as the faith is one and the baptism one and the temple and building one and the body one and the spirit one and the lord and god and father of all saints is one so the foundation is but one what ever it is eph

or else secondly if there be but one foundation for us and them to stand upon and that be the apostles and prophets themselves or thei

writings then incidit in scyllam the apostles and prophets must be supposed to be built not upon christ but upon themselves their own writings as to their faith and saving knowledge of the truth or at least on the writings one of another which is an imagination as if not more absolutely absurd than the former yet of the two i.o having his liberty to make his choice ex dieabus malis of those two evils seems to chuse the latter saying pag
that as far as their personal concernments as saints and beleevers lay in the scriptures and in order to their saving knowledge of the truth they studied the writings and prophesies of one another

conclude then against i.o that by that clause the foundation of the prophets and apostles is not intended their writings as if they laid their own scriptures for the foundation of the church and her faith hope obedience but that which the apostles themselves were built upon together with the whole church or houshold of god which could not be nor was their own writings but christ the light the letter indeed is the foundation laid by i.o and men of his mould of old for his wheel in a wheel as he speaks or his false church whose works like his own run round on and are found to have in them wheel within wheel but as for the true church of the living god which is the wheel that will turn the worlds wheels upside down it never did doth nor ever will acknowledge any fallible letter or meer transcribed text or any other thing to be the true great and blessed foundation of truth faith hope or obedience then christ iesus the same yesterday and to day and for ever who was before it now is and ever will be when the letter shall be no more at all

argument whatsoever the scripture it self layes down and testifies to be the only true foundation of the apostles and prophets and of the whole church of god and of her faith hope and obedience and of all truth that is the only true foundation of all these things
but the scripture it self layes down and testifies christ alone the light the living word and not it self to be the only true foundation of the things aforesaid therefore christ alone the light spirit and inward living word that is nigh in the heart and not the scripture it self is the only true foundation of them
the first and affirmative part of the minor is not denied by thee as the major cannot be and if thou deny the second part of the minor which is negative and denies the scripture to testifie of it self in any place that its the foundation then assign where the scripture calls it self the foundation or else own that it doth not and so that it is not the foundation at all much less the truest or the only one as thou often intimatest either expresly or in terms equivalent it is ep undefined span alphabet not any means of standing out of utter uncertainty about all sacred truth if the heb punctation be invention also
not a truer foundation for for faith to repose it self upon


argument if the scripture be the foundation for the church and all her faith and repentance to be founded and grounded upon then either there was no foundation for it before the scripture or else they who lived before the scripture had one foundation for their faith and we another and so consequently there hath been two foundations for the one faith or the one

church or body of christ but there was a foundation before the scripture and there are not two foundations of faith one to that part of the body of christ and of gods building that was before the scripture and another for that part that is built since the scripture therefore the scripture is not the foundation

argument
the foundation of the faith must be something that is infallible firm fixt certain stable sure and inalterable as the light spirit and word within onely is and gods foundation tim

the foundation of god sure to a tittle for error minimus in principio for major in medio maximus in fine the least fault or errour and deviation in the principle or foundation of any building grows greater toward the middle and is greatest at the top as it is seen in a very tower if the bottome or basis stands never so little awry as is discernable it is discerned more in the middle and much more still as it ascends higher
but the scripture letter hebrew and greek texts how ever i.o pleads their integrity in every apex point tittle and iota yet are as have shewed above more at large in answer to his long tattle about the tittles and points and indentity of lections of the letter by his own confession mistaken and mistranscribed in small things yea and in some matters of more moment and importance in the best transcribed copies of the original text therefore the text or letter of the scripture cannot be a fit foundation for the churches faith but the spirit and word within is onely so

that the light or word within and not the scriptures are the rule or canon
another thing thou assertest of the scripture is that it is the only rule of the faith and obedience of gods church
that it is undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet that more sure word of prophesie to be attended to pet
not in its self for so it was as sure as sure could be but in its giving out its evidence to us then that great miracle of miracles greater than which the apostles of christ never did behold or hear viz
that voice which came from the most excellent glory this is my beloved son which we have greater security from and by according to peter then they had in and by that miraculous voice
that moses and the prophets which who so will not hear will not be perswaded to repent though one arise to them from the dead luke

that which is the ordinary unmoveable perfect and siable infallible rule of gods worship and our obedience so that ther's no further need we should be instructed with any other new daily revelations in the knowledge of god and our duties

in the handling of this head concerning the scriptures being in the nature of the canon rule or standard to the church of god say in the nature use and office of a canon for as to the measure or bounds of your canon have elsewhere spoken to it shall have to do with thee and thee also who both are as like one another in your ignorant invectives against the qua as enemies to the scripture for not owning it to be what your and your selves have also ignorantly canonized it into the name of viz
the standing rule of faith and life as if one of you had been spit out of the others mouth
as for thy self i.o having ex sect

professed thy faith or rather fancy and opinion that the scripture is the only most perfect rule of the faith and worship of god thou stilest thy teeological subsequent foolish defence thereof a proving of it against undefined span alphabet the haters of the scriptures as if all they that side not with thy false weak supportless suppositions about the scriptures were presently to be condemned as enemies to them without any more ado

and as for thee t.d thou stilest it a spitting out of vemome and bringing in of another gospel to deny the scripture to be the rule thou engagest me in a publick discourse about this question whether the scriptures are the word of god or no and then when owning the word of god to be the word of god publickly denied the scripture that is the undefined span alphabet the undefined span alphabet

the undefined span alphabet or writing not mentioning the paper or inke that is the foolish phrase of thy own inserting to be the word of god in a shameful way of tergiversation thou ran'st away from the termes of thy question and never camest near them any more but leftest quite another question in its room viz
whether the matter contained in the writings be the rule of faith and life as the reader may see in the and
pages of thy first pamphlet sir you cannot beleeve us so simple surely as to affirm the scriptures in that sense the word of god but we mean the matter contained in the writing whether that be the rule of faith and life which matter written of and the writing or scripture are two different matters say still as the lanthorn and the candle or the light contained therein so that thy doings t.d that day was altogether as silly a peece of business as if one that had challenged another to dispute it openly with him that the lanthorn is the candle or the light being come as t.d did undefined span alphabet with much pompous shew or fancy upon the publick place of hearing before hundreds to that purpose should say to his antagonist on this wise sir you cannot beleeve me to be so simple surely as to affirm the lanthorn to be the candle or light but mean the candle or light contained in the lanthorn whether that be a rule for men to walk by in a dark night or no a question which was never denied by his antagonist at all for neither nor any qua that know deny the word of god to be the word of god which is contained in the scripture or that the scripture or writing declares thereof any more then we deny the candle and light to be a candle and a light which is contained in the lanthorn but that the writing it self is that word of god written of in it or that the lanthorn is the candle or the light that is in the lanthorn at least that the word of god is the proper name of the scripture as to his shame hath undertaken to prove in latine against the qua of whom he saith they understand him not in that tongue this and the qua do deny against him and thee and all men for our denial of which dream of our benighted doctors and divinet we have been yet damned down through the false suggestions and silly insinuations of their busie the priests by all parliaments and powers that have yet appeared at the helm in this nation and deemed unmeet to be let into the lists of that liberty of conscience allowed to other men and doomed out as deniers of the fundamentals of religion
thus t.d
as the king of spain and forty thousand men went up a hill and then came down agen
gathered his forces and together pitching his own day of battel betokening to obtain some eminent victory over the qua and as soon as he came into the field laid down his arms and confessed he had no quarrel against the qua as to the question he was to dispute about as stated and held by them so like some bettle he flyes aloft with a humming noise into the ayr and at last flaps suddenly down into a peece of cowdung

nevertheless t.d that thou mightest for very shame seem to do something for the scripture even for the book it self and letter of it as well as for the good matter therein contained sith thou wast come upon the stage

on that account after some parley that was held a while between my self and thee about the latitude and limits of your supposed rule in which thy pitiful poor put offs of the proofs by me urged against thee are elsewhere discovered thou rouzest up thy self into a new proposal of thy question in these terms
viz
whether the hooks commonly called the old and new testament were appointed by god for a standing rule of faith and life which denying the books to be thou repliest on this wise viz now you have spit out your venome which knew you were big with and will say to you as the apostle if any man bring any other gospel then what we have received let him be accursed to which when replied am sure the gospel you preach will never bring men to heaven
thou relatest thy self replying thus viz
then friends you hear his acknowledgement and how well he deserves the curse denounced against him

by all which passages the reade may observe these things


that thou judgest the scriptures to be not only the standing rule of faith and life but also to be the gospel

that there is no other gospel designed by god as the standing rules then the scriptures

that he that owns any thing else besides the scriptures to be the rule or the gospel and he that denies the gospel the ministers of the letter preach which is but the letter and the scripture to be unable to bring men to heaven though intended by those words viz the gospel you preach the false doctrine and unholy matter ye hold forth when ye deny the light and plead a necessity of sinning in this life and hold men to be justified and guiltless while under the guilt of murder and adultery and damn it as a doctrine of devils to affirm any perfect purging from sin in this world and such like and not the scriptures which ye are far enough from preaching truly the very letter of is big with and spits out venome against the scriptures and brings another gospel then that ye have received and to be held accursed and well deserves the curse denounced against him by the apostle gal

and in all these matters thou art coincident with i.o who in substance asserts with thee the very same alluding to the place gal

in proof of the scriptures to be the gospel and the only perfect rule of faith and worship ex


rep
but alas poor simple silly unlearned and ignorant men ye may curse them that bring another gospel then that ye have received indeed who never at all yet received the true gospel which the galatians received from paul who was not a minister of the letter to shew which is all your gospel but of the spirit and of the light which only while the dead letter cannot do it saves and brings to heaven and gives the life which light and spirit is the old gospel which we bring and minister to men while you for your meer letters sake alter and despise it say ye may curse in pauls words but pauls curse will come upon you which being causelesly denounced against us by you cannot come on us

now before come to urge any new arguments against the scripture or letters being in the authority of the only standing rule as both t.d
of his second toy and i.o
assert it to be concluding that there is no other rule or measure of judging and determining any thing about the saving

doctrine of the gospel but the writing the scriptures shall take some account of some of t.d and weak rushy kinde of reasonings by way of answer to such arguments as are urged by us against their reasonless suppositions in that behalf

beginning first with t.d jejune replies to what reasons were rendred by us to him against his dream that there is no other standing rule of faith and life but the scriptures and so proceeding to an examination of his and excentrick exhibitions of the scriptures being the only rule thereof interchangeably as see occasion
the first argument urged against thee t.d at the third publick dispute as thy self relatest it in
of thy first pamphlet to prove the scripture not the only rule of faith and life was this
arg
if there be another standing rule then the scripture is not it
but there is another standing rule therefore the scripture is not it
the minor thou deniest and sayest expresly that there is no other standing rule but the scripture which minor my proof of which thou rendrest as weakly as well as thou canst proved in these very terms viz
if the scripture it self sends us to another viz the spirit as our rule then it self is not the onely rule but it self doth so therefore it self is not it
the minor of this being denied by thee was proved thus that which the scripture bids us walk in by after or according to that it sends to but the scripture it self bids us walk in by a fur or according to the spirit therefore the scripture sends us to another besides it self as our rule and consequently is not it self the only standing rule of faith and life in proof of this minor gal

was cited and some other scriptures which thou leavest out whether as one loath to tell too much of that truth that makes against thee or no will leave to thy conscience and not say but some may likely think so for all that as namely gal

and to open as see occasion in order to the service of that truth am now pleading against thee

nevertheless it were not for the truths sake that it may more fully appear there is little need to say any thing more to thee than thou thy self hast set down in thy reply to that text viz
this say walk in or rather to or according to the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh for it is undefined span alphabet][undefined span alphabet the dative case which without the preposition's is elsewhere by or according to viz gal

phil

undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet as many as walk according to this rule let us walk by the same rule is so jejune and wretched and poor and miserably blinde and naked being no other then this viz that phrase doth denote the priniple not the rule of our obedience in that place where if by principle thou intendest the foundation which the word principles is sometimes used as synonomous unto

then thou quite overthrowest i.o and helpest me against him however but that is no news for beside that each of you

often contradicts himself ye are for all your siding to vindicate the same points of false doctrine against the qua so frequently sound contradicting each other that in order to the consutation of you both a man may finde contradiction enough either in each of your writings within themselves or in the writing of one of you unto the other and so tis in this case for i.o owns no other principle or foundation of discovery of divine truth then the scriptures for the faith to stand on
but thou ownest the spirit to be the principle of obedience
if the phrase denotes the principle only and not the rule as it does not for it denotes both yet the other places mentioned do denote more expresly the light and spirit and not the letter to be the rule which said light and spirit that is the power of god to say the truth is both the principle upon which all true faith is founded and is to stand cor
in the movings of which obedience is to be acted and also the rule according to which as it moves leads guides directs impowers and no otherwise all things that are at all are to be both done and believed

and no less do all those phrases however denote viz rom

who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then a being taught led guided ruled directed by as well as moved acted and enabled from the spirit so or so to believe or do for it is undefined span alphabet which praeposition though join'd with the genitive signifies contra against as gal

and no less then so doth phil

import where paul to the saints at philippi with the bishop and deacons according to their several statures and degrees of growth in the light and spirit of christ wishes all that were perfect as every one is that is faithful to his own measure to be so minded as himself yet leaving every one to believe and judge by his own measure of light not binding any one to his till god himself should reveal things as he knew them to those that were yet otherwise minded neverthelesse quoth he whereunto we have already attained let us walk or steere our course by the same rule let us mind the same thing which same rule or same thing that he wills all though their measures of light may be different to mind and walk by he that shall dream it to be the letter of the scripture without and not the inward light grace and spirit of christ a measure and manifestation of which is according to the measure of the gift of christ distributing to every one severally as he will to some more some less some one some two yet to every one one talent at least given to every man to profit withall to improve trade with and thrive by matth

know the things of god for they are spiritually discerned and by the spiritual man only that discerns and judges all and is falsely judged by all though truly discerned by none that are beneath him

the outward scripture say is profitable to such as timothy was to men of god to make them who are wise in the spirit wiser and wiser through their faith in the light to their own and others salvation and to furnish such a minister as timothy was who knows when and being in the spirit how and how far forth to use it for every good work in his ministry and such as are full of might and power first by the spirit of the lord upon them as micah was mic
and as apollo was are mighty also in the scripture and furnished mightily to confound the scribes and all of the light as they were in their times
so that we deny not the scriptures ad extra to be many wayes useful profitable in their place and time where they are to be read as they are not in so much as the tenth part of the world and where they are read in the light by them who live in that light that gave them forth which are not the hundreth part of those that usually read and search them but will all this prove them to be what i.o and t.d contend so stiffly to have them be viz in that high authority of the rule nay the only most perfect standing rule of all true belief and holy life before the very light and spirit of god they had their very original supreme being from thorow the hands of holy men as but subordinate instruments in their first purity as writings except that little that was pend by god himself which we now have not which scriptures yet as to the being they now have are handed to us from no higher principle then the transcription of meer fallible and as i.o sayes men

ab sit imaginatio let the thoughts hereof be far from us that the scripture is the only rule for if we should grant it to be so far as truly transcribed in the copies of the original a rule at all or a secondary rule which name of rule is more than it any where calls it self by yet the prime most perfect rule it is not much less is it the only rule to the church or any men and though we are as forward as any on a due account to own the profitablenss of the very letter as it declares of the words of truth and uprightness and the doctrine that is according unto godliness and to own its great usefulness as to

the purposes premised and so affirm that the dead letter so far as not depraved from its primitive purity doth as truly answer and hold proportion with the light and living word as the shadow doth with the substance the picture with the living person it represents and as the voice which is imago verbi the image of the word with the word it is the image of or the eccho which is the image of the voice doth with the voice it answers to insomuch that as quae conveniunt in aliquo tertio santidem what holds measure or weight and keeps correspondency or proportion with a third thing that agrees with the standard or sealed canon agrees also with the standard it self so whose life squares truly and substantially with the letter convenes with the light and spirit it imediately issued out from and he that lives and speaks perfectly and adaequately according to the scripture so far speaks and lives according to and not besides the light and spirit which the letter requires man to live beleeve and walk in and by as neither doth or can he erre from the letter if he had never heard read or seen it who answers the measure of the light and spirit that is lent him to live by yet for all this as t.d gives this reason for his untrue imagination why this part of the inspired scripture you have only is the only rule and not any sermons or private religious discourses which have the same common ends with the scriptures no nor yet any other writings but those ye have if we could prove and produce as assuredly we shall anon any legitimate ones of divine inspiration though otherwise as useful and profitable as those ye have and agreeing therewith viz because god did not give order quoth he for the one as he did thinks he for the other and there is no other scripture appointed of god to be a rule of faith and manners but what is bound up in the bible and where he appointed that we must take account of you by and by for besides such inspiration to make a rule is necessary gods appointment of a writing to that end saith he god thought that sufficient which we have therefore we can look upon no more with such regard at we do upon that
see t.d first pamphlet
and of his second pamphlet
the difference quoth he is in gods arbitrary dispensation so do give this reason of our true assertion that howbeit the scripture is profitable and may be useful and called as by it self yet it no where is a rule as it agree's with the light and spirit where it is not adulterated by mans mistransciptions mistranslations misconstructions

yet the canon or most perfect and only standing rule it is not because god did never authorize or appoint it so to be but to retort back to t.d in his own vain phrase thought the measure of his light and spirit every one hath from himself sufficient to make a standard of besides whose inspiration of the said scripture to make a rule is necessary gods appointment of a writing to such an end the difference lyes in god arbitrary dispensation as well as in the excellent preheminence of the spirit and light above the letter who would have that to be the rule canon standard touchstone which was so from the beginning of the world two thousand years afore the letter was even to this day even the spirit then which there can be no other designed by him to that end if i.o words be true ex

who saith vnicus est undefined span alphabet divinus the divine canon or rule is but one not more then which also there is no other mentioned in the scripture by that name of the rule but the light and spirit as have shewed above out of those places where the

rule is spoken of and if there be let i.o or t.d assign where and hereupon as he saith in the other case so conclude here in this we can look upon none but the light and spirit upon no letter with such regard as the only rule as we do upon that

so then notwithstanding t.d's impertinent unimportant utterly untrue reply to this argument that we are to walk by is our rule but the spirit is that the scripture sayes we are to walk by gal

therefore the spirit is the rule which reply runs viz that phrase denotes the principle not the rule of our obedience in that place the argument stands firm over the head of it for though it betoken the principle also yet not only nor exclusively of the rule but rather the rule more evidently and much more eminently than the other yea that the spirit is the principle of all true obedience is professed positively by us who own nothing to be truly done in way of true obedience unto god nor the letter but what is done from the principle power motion assistance and ability of the spirit of god or that is done without the spirits yet in that place considered together with the rest above cited it is most clear that the apostle speaks of the spirit principally as of the rule by which we are to walk and the word walk imports no less than the act of proceeding or going on and not the principle original or primum mobile as may say from which we are to begin to act and move in way of obedience unto god

but as unanswerable as t.d answer is to our argument yet it serves us very well to prove him a as he and i.o also are in multitudes of more matters besides and in that it is as answerable as may to his wonted self for let but any reasonable reader observe as it follows
of his first pamphlet what t.d sayes next of all to this passage of the spirits being the principle that is the original or beginning of our obedience from which as being the primum movens and auxilians beforehand moving and assisting we are after to obey and he shall see how he overthrows it himself in his own most immediately ensuing speech for howbeit he sayes the spirit is the principle of our obedience which is as much as to say that in which we first walk whose assistance must be antecedent to our true walking according to the letter which is not denied by us yet when we say the same with him he unsayes his own saying again rather then he will side with us for whereas said as his own self there relates that the spirit is antecedent to the letter so that none tan walk in the letter till they walk in the spirit he replies thus viz
the spirit is subsequent to the letter in respect of the assistance and ability which he gives to obedience and whereas you affirm quoth he that none can walk in the letter till they walk in the spirit if walking in the spirit be meant of special assistance which is as much as to say if by that phrase of walking in the spirit you mean the spirits being the prinriple of our obedience tis false for many walk in many things according to the letter without the spirits in dwelling· as paul while a pharisee was touching the righteousness of the law blameless psa
in which beside the rounds he runs in and the contradiction to himself above t.d sayes false for though none walk according to the letter in truth and as to the spiritual obedience it calls for without the spirits and assistance and power as the principle from which they must so walk for howbeit paul walked according to the righteousness of

the law interpreted in sensu pharisaico according to the pharisees outside glosses on it who saw not into the marrow mystery and spirituality of it and was zealous of god as to the literal observation of many things yet till the law which is the light and spiritual came to him who was in his carnal condition and shewed him sin in the lust of which christ expounds the law matth

the spirit is the principle from which we are to walke and with ut which we cannot walke according to the letter yet to go round again many walk according to the letter without the spirits so pervenire ad summum nisi ex principiis nemo potest pervenire ad summm sine principiis aliquis potest
this is the summe of t.ds doctrine
besides if the spirit be the principle only that men begin to beleeve and obey from and not the rule according to which they go on in beleeving and obeying then it seems with thee faith is to be begun and begotten and born by the spirit but kept preserved and nourished up to perfection by the letter which is a doctrine of deep dotage and deceit for it is the spirit of christ and the light that is both the creator and preserver the author and finisher of the faith insomuch that may truly and do here justly cry out against you blind bewitching broachers and your blind bewitched beleevers of it as paul on the galatians marvel that ye should be so sottishly departed and degenerated from the simplicity of the primitive gospel so plainly declared in the very letter it self which asserts the light spirit and word within to be both the principle and the rule
ye foolish prophets and foolish people who hath bewitched you that ye should be so reprobate as to the knowledge of the truth are ye so foolish as to fancy that when men have once begun in the spirit they must be preserved in their faith and regulated and made perfect by their fleshly attendences to the letter that the and ministers meerly of it and not of the spirit are so lost about and wrangling about that to this day they are not agreed about the integrity of its text they that ministed the spirit among men at first and were even by the very letter they wrote ministers by whom men beleeved in the light did they call them so much to the heeding or hearing of the letter themselves wrote as to the hearing of the word of faith they preached and testified to both in their writings and by word of mouth even that which before they wrote to them at all was nigh in their heart and in their mouth that they might do it tell me ye that desire to be under the teachings of the letter only not the light do you not hear the letter telling of another rule besides it self which it self doth only point to doth not the letter teach you the spirit and light is both the principle and principal means also of discovery of right and wrong as is shewed above doth the letter part the business of our obedience as your party coloured discourses thereof would seem to make it do between it self and the spirit or say any where that the spirit is the principle but the letter it self the rule of our obedience that the spirit creates and the letter preserves faith as t.d dreamingly divines saith it not that the spirit is both

and yet the not to say madness of our now ministers another while again even within the space of one page behold ye wandring wonderers and wondering after these vain men and their whisling that would seem wise though they are but as wilde asses and ye shall see t.d who affirms the spirit to be the principle and that which creates faith and the letter the rule that it affirming the letter to be both i.e not only the only rule of it but the principle of it also and ascribing in these words
of his as also in the
page of his second god did not intend nor give order for them i.e for more writings than we have in our bibles to be the rule but hath assured us as much as is sufficient to create and preserve faith in the gospel we have both the first being begetting and beginning of faith to the scripture as also i.o who jumps with him in one as they do together in most things in these words ex

not only the begetting of faith but also the building up in it while we live here is the end of the scripture



what more is uttered by t.d as to this head of the scriptures being the only rule is in answer to this argument was urged against him as himself relates it but to disadvantage
of his first pamph at the dispute on this wise if the rule of faith and life was before the scripture was then the scripture is not the rule but the rule was before the scripture therefore
to which said answer of t.d is no other than a giving of the whole cause in question between us viz whether the scripture i.e the writing or letter is the rule or no sor quoth t.d
your argument concludes nothing against us for we assert the matier contained in the scripture is a standing rule argument proves but that there was a rule before this writing we grant that god revealed himself by visions dreams since the gospel preached to adam there hath not been any increase of truths quoad essentiam sed tantum quoad explicationem as the learned speak of the articles of our faith the manner of conveyance is different then and now but the matter or doctrines conveyed still the same
rep
if this conclude nothing against you for as much as ye own doctrine or matter only contained in and declared by the scripture and not the letter to be the rule how conclusive you outcries are against the qua as that they are denyers of the scripture a fool may feel since they own the holy doctrine and matter in the scripture which is the light spirit and word in the heart to be the rule as your selves do and so to have been also before the scripture was though they deny the meer writing to be the rule which with your selves is not the matter conveyed but meerly the manner of conveyance not the essential truth it self but only the form of its explication which manner of conveyance or form of explication your selves it seems do deny here to be the rule as well as we with us asserting only the matter truth or doctrine contained and conveyed in the writing so to be

if ye assert no more than the truth doctrine or matters contained in the scriptures to be the rule which matters thou thy self t.d
of thy first pamph sayest is that word of faith the apostles preached which was the word we assert to be the rule that is nigh in the heart rom and

dare not assert your selves the meer letter or scripture so to be trow wherein differ you from the quae whom you quarrel with as deniers of the scriptures will you never be at quiet with the qua but quarrelling against them when they affirm the truths wherein your selves assent to them as much as when they deny the untruths wherein ye dissent from them will you allow them neither to say the sound doctrines which your selves are forced to confess to nor to gainsay the errors and false doctrines which ye would fain force you false faith of upon them ye assert no more but that the matter or doctrine conveyed and truth explicated therein which is the light spirit or living word it self is the rule as thou sayest here so denying the letter writing or meer text to be it we affirm nor more nor less yet ye own and justifie your selves as owners and deny and judge us as deniers as of of the scriptures ye challenge us to dispute it against us that the scripture is the word of god the only rule when we meet you before hundreds to that end you confess with us as christopher fowler did at reading t.d at sandwich and i.o doth in his declartion or latine divinity disputations

that you mean not the scripture formally considered the letter or text it self ye talk for not the writing but the holy matter and doctrine contained held forth testified to therein the word in the heart of which we say its a light a rule denying the letter only so to be yet the same truth when ye tell it is the truth when we tell it as a lye ye venture upon the open stage against us a vile persons in our tenets about the scriptures when ye are there ye verefie the very truth we vindicate against you and say with us the scripture or writing which is the formality of the scripture quae dat esse rei sormally considered is not the word nor the rule nor any thing but a dead letter only the matter and truth of the text testified to is the word rule light as we say it is only yet when ye go away though from the first to the last ye give us the cause yet we must give you leave or else you will steal it to carry away the colours and boast and brag and vapour as the men that had the victory till by venting your lyes so fast to manifest the qua folly ye fling out your own folly to the view of all men

all this while you go about to delude the simple as if you denied only this way of writing to have alwayes been the only way of conveyance and you magnifie the spirit that with more security ye may throw down the letter of the scripture and if you would speak out plainly that ye call the spirit will be found to be the dictates of your consciences blinde and corrupt as they are the lord knows and you are no further bound to obey the letter of the scripture then you are willing to obey it

rep as for thy lyes of the friends of truth that light stuff like the chaffe the winde will drive away the lord knows whose consciences are blind and corrupt yours or ours and as to thy slighting the dictates of conscience which work i.o is not behinde thee in flouting at what is dictated by the light of god in it and by the light therein from it to men as figment fannaticism enthusiasm and such like dirty denominations need refer no further then too i.o whose magnifications of the dictates of conscience otherwhiles may well serve to the contradiction and confutation of himself and thee too and stop both thy mouth and his own too who pag
of the conscience and the voice of god therein and the instinct of good

and evil and god hath placed and indeleably planted therein it declares it self to be from god by its own light and authority there is no need to convince a man by substantial witnesses that what his conscience speaks it speaks from god whether it bear testimony to the righteousness of god or that obedience which is eternally and indispensably due to him it shews the work of the law written in the heart and discovers its author in whole name it speaks and much more to the like purpose so that he and thou too may with shame enough reflect upon your ignorant vilifications of it

as for our obedience to the letter we are by the spirit so bound to that not so far only as we are willing as thou us but in a cross to our own wills that while we walk in the spirit which is our rule we cannot disobey the letter but fulfill it while your selves who prate of your being bound to obey it walk at large after your own wills and lusts in the liberty of your flesh and through your boundless boasting of that ye as boundlesly break do dishonour both god and your selves
as for our going about to deceive the simple we deny all deceivers and deceit teaching no other doctrine nor gospel then what paul delivered then which whoever it is that brings or broaches another whether it be we who are hated as devils or you who are honoured as angels of light from heaven by such as dwell in the depths and darkness of hell say with paul let him be accursed but those are now marked and manifested plainly enough who cause the divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine the saints learned of old by the children of the day are avoided also for they that are such serve not the lord iesus christ but their own bellies and yet by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple rom
what t.d sayes in his second pamph as to this question of the scriptures being a rule is no new thing but a reference of men for an answer to whiteheads queries which he was shye of saying much to seeing he had not much to say to his old trite trivial toy entituled the qua
folly the very book that whitehead had routed before and so dry is t.d pumped that most of his two excepting the wings it flyes with
his epistle and his narrative consists of repetitions of what he had uttered in the other that was routed and new references of his reader to that old one notwithstanding so much is added to to this head in
of his second pamph as more fully gives us the cause we contend for against him viz
that the truth doctrine matter and not the scripture text or letter is the rule to men must quoth he again refer the reader for an answer to these queries meaning g.ws to qua
folly in which yet none of them are answered and adde the matter contained in the scriptures is a rule to all men so far as tis revealed to them and was so before it was put into writing and so much of it as is written upon the hearts of heathens is a rule to them

rep minde reader how t.d yeelds the question to the qua again in his late last lazy labours which question between the qua and the priests is not about the holy doctrine truth and matter for the qua still own that to be as to the substantials before which the shadowy figurative part thereof flyes away everlastingly the same an inalterable fixt firm inward spiritual word and light which neither doth not can ever perish corrupt or pass away but about the outward scripture writing text or letter

which uno ore with one voice all our priests and people vote to be the rule touchstone word which we deny which matter notwithstanding when it comes to the point of proof before people they dare denominate only to be the only rule and word denying those high titles to the naked letter as well as we crying out with a dreadful ditty against the qua in their pulpits as deniers of the scriptures the bible to be the word of god the rule and when we enter the lifts with them then finding themselves unable to carry it against us falling down before us in confessions to us that it is the divine truth and matter only contained in the scripture which is the rule to all men so far as it that is that truth and matter is revealed to them as it is here confessed also by t.d to be to the very heathen in their hearts that have no scripture and was so before it was put into writing that is before the scripture was which seeing it is so confest in the same way as argued above about the foundation against i.o so may here against t.d and him both about the rule viz

arg
the rule must be something that is in being before the faith and life that is to be regulated by it

must be that the scripture testifies to be the rule

something that is firm fixt sure stable inflexible infallible inalterable else all the work wrought by a lesbian rule a soft waxen measure may be ad infinitum crooked scanty erroneous disorderly in all dimensions at mens pleasure who may as our priests mostly do transcribe translate expound rectifie the scripture according to their crooked conceits and their antichristian analogy of faith as they use to speak and not their crooked conceits and false faith according to the true theology that is plain to godly honest hearted men in the wrest their rule to their own wills interests and where it likes not their unruly selves to be ruled by it run from it or rather rule over ir as they list
but the light and spirit and truth and living word and holy doctrine was in being before the faith and life of any man

is testified by the scripture at is above shewed to be the rule
is inalserable firm and the scripture it self is already proved and is yet more to be proved not to be so therefore the light truth not the scripture text is the rule
be sides what ioh
tombs and rich who must here be wrapt with their own weapon argue falsely against the lights being the rule may truly argue against the letters being it
for page
of their book entituled the true old light
thus they dispute viz
that which is variable and alterable cannot be a persons rule for its the property of a rule to be invariable and the same at all times
the rules measures and weights and dialls and squares and what other things are made if they be varied they cease to be rules for rules should be fixed and certain
but there is nothing more variable then mens light in them say they falsely but say truly then a letter or writing without that which is to day say they taken for light is to morrow judged to be darkness and that light which is this day in a person may be lessened to morrow a person may become fanatick and dote who yesterday was heard with applause therefore each persons light cannot be his rule so us that at all times he should be bid to look to it as a safe guide as the qua do

and say that which is to day transcribed translated interpreted so and in such a sense by some may be through be wrested as a nose of wax to morrow by others into a clear contrary sense by transposition of hebrew letters which in shape and sound are alike either in way of mistake among the most careful scribes in the world or at the will and pleasure of criticks who ad libitum may turn the text into twenty senses one after another as seems good to them witness i.o himself who as is elswhere shewed in many pages together of his epistle dedicatory tells how easie it is so to do yea to turn that one word undefined span alphabet by the different pointing of it into sundry senses some whereof are clear contrary to each other yea it is but doing so or so saith he and as many various lections arise in the very original text as a man pleases to make
it being so then with the letter that it is so variable and flexible and contrariwise the light being fixt firm stable without variation as it is for all their lying of it it's eternally and unchangeably the same even yesterday to day and for ever as christ is from whom it comes one and the same in all the foundation and witness of god which stands sure and keeps its place in the consciences of men let them go whether they will testifying the same truth as gods witness in all men that it doth in any both de jure defacto also never consenting to any evil but condemning it all in all men more or less

therefore say in consutation of i.to and rich
baxter out of their own books the light word and spirit of god within every one may and ought to be every mans rule so as that at all times he should be bid to look to it and follow it as a guide as the qua do
but the text or letter without however owned as it is by me above to be useful and profitable for men of god that know how to use it cannot be the most perfect stable standard much less the only infallible rule and guide of mens faith and life as the blind guides say in words it is though in works they themseves live and walk besides it as much as any
again if the scriptures be the rule and not the light and spirit then either there was no rule before the scripture or else they who lived before the scripture had one rule we another and so consequently there are two rules for the one faith of the one holy church
but all these whimsies are most absurd for then the one church hath tot regulus quot novas explicationes ejusdem veritaetis as many rules as particular wayes of revelation of the truth
and t.d said the truth was one and that the matter was the rule before the writing was and i.o sayes ex

vnicus est undefined span alphabet divinus the divine rule is but one and so say of the one general catholick church or assembly of the first born from abel to this day therefore the light spirit and not the scripture is the rule

as for i.os shallow shuffling off the lights being the rule and sleight slinging at it testaque lutoque with his muddy pellet in that section

if every mans private light be the rule of obedience then we have as many rules as men but the divine rule is onely one and that only one quoth he falsely elsewhere

is the scripture

rep
his minor as is said above serves our turn and as for his major

its consequence is most false if by the word private light he means every ones particular measure of light that shines from god into his conscience for that doth not make tot regulas so many men so many rules for the light and spirit which is the only rule is one and the thing in all distributed to every one as to degrees which never vary the nature of any thing severally as seems good to him and this is but a piece of his own peevish private piece of prate so often as he doth in his disputes to term the light of god we testifie to as one in all though in different measures lumen privatum the private light for its lumen publicum commune that one publick light that comes and is communicated from god and reproves sin in all men and never did nor doth consent to any iniquity but condemns it in all men and all men as found in sin and were i.o as well skilled in the scripture as he is in the way of unskilful scribling for it and would once learn of paul whom he often prates on he would have learnt ere this time with him to stile the light in all the different measures of it attained to by men to be but one rule one thing still and not to say that if every man minde the light in himself then so many men so many rules which apostle phil

saith whereunto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us minde the same thing

and as to t.ds saying that so much of the matter contained in the scripture as is written upon the hearts of the heatbens is a rule to them very readily grant that to be the very truth but what will t.d get by it but
the glory of his granting to the qua that other grand question about which he quarrels with them viz· the being of a measure of the same matter and not naral as man is in statu corrupto but supernatural and spiritual light of truth which is contained and testified in the scripture to be in all men in the world even in the heathen that have not the scripture

the fuller just censure of a contradicter of himself who by telling the truth herein gainsayes that false doctrine which he teaches for truth in another place
for here he owns some of the same truth or holy doctrine declared in the scripture which himself and i.o stickle to prove it against such as deny it not for the truth is so though the text is not that every tittle and apex thereof is as equally divine or supernatural and entirely given by god himself and as immediately as the very voice wherewith he spake to and in the prophets
see i.o
and properly the word of god
and the gospel and a supernatural and spiritual light and such like
see i.o
and t.d
of
pamph and
of his
pamph
say here t.d owns some of that same matter light truth law or gospel the letter declares to be written upon the hearts of the heathens that never had the letter and to be the rule from god to them

but when we affirm as the scripture doth and t.d too that every man in the world is enlightned by christ the true light joh
with some measure of that light the letter speaks of and hath some of that holy divine supernatural spiritual truth doctrine and evangelical matter which the whole scripture either more obscurely or more clearly declares then he denies it asserting the gentiles or heathens to have none of those judgements that god gave to israel and as t.d to the contradiction of himself so christus nullâ sub consideratione lumen salutare omnibus stngulis hominibus du sit ex


christ hath in no kind vouchsafed saving light to all and every man

one ignorant untrue assertion more of t.d while my eye is on it may not here let pass without notifying it to the reader and then for ought see may leave t.d as to his talk of the scriptures being in the nature or office or authority of a rule and see what i.o sayes as to this
t.d sayes
of his
pamph
suppose we had the signs recorded that are not written yet were they not our rule yet confesses that were they written they might be useful being done for the very same end with those lest us
telling him he contradicts himself in so saying t.d answers he is not sensible of any contradiction herein but of subordination only between the efficient and instrumental cause that the second creation doth not exclude though the first did instruments or second causes instancing iam
of his own will begat he us by the word of truth and rom
faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god
rep
to which say t.d is not so little sensible of the contradiction g.w charges him with as every understanding reader may be greatly sensible of the flat falshood that is told for truth in this latter clause wherein he asserts the first creation did exclude second causes or instruments though the second doth not whereas if t.d had not been in a dream he would have seen that the first creation is so far from excluding instruments or second causes if that be an instrument or second cause which himself instances to be one in the second creation viz
the word of god for as the scripture sayes that the saints are begotten to god and faith by the word of god so it sayes but that our scriblers for the scriptures are little skill'd in it and so study it in their dark minds till they cannot see what who is not blinde cannot easily heb
pet

by faith we understand in plurali the worlds were framed by the word of god and that by the word of god the heavens and earth were of old and the heavens and earth that now are by the same word are kept in store and reserved to fire against the day of judgement and perdition of ungodly men
you had need be ashamed to pretend to be such appearers in publick pro scripturis that appear so much in your testimony so flatly against them as ye do
now as to os prosecution of the proof of this matter which he so often over and over again avouches as a truth with divine faith to be imbraced on pain and peril of eternal ruine and damnation viz that the scriptures are in the authority of the only and perfect rule and canon since the compleating of which no inward light or spirit or new revelations about the faith and divine worship of the saints are either to be expected or admitted it lyes more in the negative then the positive or affirmative consisting for more largely of disproofs such as they are of any inward light spirit or spiritual revelation to be at all then of proofs of the letter or scripture yet some pedling ones are puzled out to such a purpose to be altogether and alone the rule of faith holy life and divine worship

he professes to prove the inward spirit or light the qua plead for not to be the rule and that the scripture or letter is so two wayes first authoritative or by the scripture it self

rationative or by a rational way of argumentation but though own the authority and veracity of the scripture so far that if i.o could produce any place of the bible as he pretends

to do many wherein the scriptures do ascribe to themselves the honor authority and title of the onely perfect rule either in terminis or by any such due deduction as is not more duely deniable then so much as probale to a prudent man indeed should truly submit to one such testimony being perswaded that the scriptures are writings of truth where not altered and not adulterated by mens mistakings and mistranscribings yet the scriptures being wrested besides all sense and reason by j.o and the theologians he adhears to to that end deny his proofs to be either athoratative or rational

the testimonies he urges the authority of to prove the text to be in the authority of the only rule he casts into four classes the first sort of which consist of such places as expresse as he sayes and undefined span alphabet vel per immediatam cousequentiam perfectionem hanc scripturis ascribunt do expresly verbatim or else by immediate consequence ascribe such a perfection as of the only rule to the scriptures
the second such as expresly reject all additions to the text and word of god whatever
the third such as contain the examples of christ and the apostles trying and commanding to try all things by the scriptures
the fourth such as commend the holy scriptures to all religious uses
of the first sort he impannels eleven in all· not being able it seems to pick out a whole jury to serve his turn howbeit acknowledge these if they would as freely as he forcibly would have them pass their verdict for him to be enough being all of them good and true witnesses in another case then he calls them for they stand all together in ex

which· vail is to be and is done away no otherwise then in christ the light and by turning to the lord that spirit as paul sayes it is then doth it not rather appear that the undefined span alphabet the letter written and engraven outwardly is not the onely most proper standing rule but christ's light the spirit and the measure and manifestation thereof within given to every man to profit withal and what though paul to timothy doth commend the inspired scripture if yet we shall take that for the outward writing as profitable to make the man of god who onely knows how to use it wisely more and more wise and to furnish him perfectly to exhort and every good work against the gainsayers as have shewed above that deny not the outward scripture so to be to such a one and what though christ saies in order to escaping the place of torment let men hear moses and the prophets if yet we shall take moses and the prophets for their outward writings and what though john sayes christ did more then he wrote of him as well he might for matthew mark and luke wrote many things that he did not and others wrote other matters that were written by none of these what though he doth write that his writings were that the saints might believe that christ was the son of god and believing might live through his name and that their joy might be full i.e
that encrease might be to them of faith and joy see joh
does their being useful and profitable and penn'd for the same common end as the light is given for in the conscience conclude them by such an immediate consequence as j.o conceives to be design'd and appointed by god to be canoniz'd and established into the onely canon into the sole standing rule and standard for all things of faith manners and worship to be tryed by so that nothing can or may safely be believed done or practised in obedience to god or acceptable to him without particular and expresse recourse first had unto the scriptures

if this be good and immediate consequence of j.o viz the scriptures and letter hath the same common end with the spirit and light and is useful and profitable comfortable and serviceable as the other is though not so much
therefore the scripture or letter is the onely most perfect universally for all truth to be tryed by the onely canon for men to come to whereby to be rectified in faith life worship and all obedience

then at least must t.d j.o's
joint antagonist against the qua and the truth be judg'd a meer jugling disputant and shufling sophister if he own it as any other then a non sequittar unless he will rather chuse to join with me here against in denying of this consequence and against himself too as to his asserting the scripture to be the rule for as much as when twas urged against him in the same kind at the dispute but in a way of much

more necessary consequence then o's
crooked conclusion comes in by to the defect of as they call it in its integrals on this wise

if there were other inspired scriptures that are not bound up in your bibles as useful and profitable and written to the same end with those you have then they were as much a rule as those ye have
but there were in proof of which minor instance was given in the first epistle to the corinthians mentioned in the first we have cor
where paul sayes wrote unto you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators and now have written to you not to keep company by which it seems both epistles one of which is not in the now bible were written by the same apostle to one and the same end
t.d replyes to this effect see
of his first pamph
deny your consequence
sermons religious discourses have the same common end with the written scriptures yet the letter onely are our standing rule
and
all that was written by holy men and preserved for our use is not therefore our standing rule
and two bald reasons is rendred in the same page viz
because god intended these that are bound up in our bibles but not the rest neither such as are lost for had he intended those so lost poovidence would have watcht over them as over the rest nor such as are by his providence preserved neither if not in our bibles
and pag
of t.d second pamph
suppose quoth he we had the signs faithfully recorded in our bible where they are wanting yet were they not our rule because god did not give order for them he hath assured us as much as is sufficient to create and encrease faith
and pag
if you say as you seem to do if they all were done to the same end then being written they must reach the same end
deny your consequence quoth he the difference lyes in god's arbitrary dispensation
now if t.d deny the consequence of the qua which is two fold clearer and more cogent then i.o when they say all scriptures written by inspiration and preserved for our use to this day are a rule to us as much as any of them are whether bound up or not bound up by stationers in our bibles
then how much more must he side with me in denying j.o's far fetch't consequence though j.o calls it immediate unlesse he will be denied justly for a daubing deceiver when j.o argues thus viz
the scriptures are useful profitable and written to the same good ends and purposes as the light spirit and word of god therefore the scriptures the letter and not the inward light spirit word or any internal revelation at all are the only most perfect standing rule of all things in matter of faith life doctrine worship
but have reason to suspect and fear that of a feather however they clash and thwart one another and fall out among themselves in the dark yet will fall in flock and flye all together in the face of the light rather then seem to side therewith against each other and that by some secundum quid or other they'l seem to qualifie their more then seeming confusions if they can

nevertheless let them agree as they please may safely make bold before all but partial prejudiced persons to deny j.o's
consequence and put my self under t.d's patronage in so doing who denyes the same save onely that its much more sound and cogent when used to him ward by the qua and indeed

so it fares and falls out with my two antagonists i.o and t.d that though they join to carry on the same cause against the qu improving their wits up what proofs they can in the points wherein they oppose them yet their witnesses agree so little with each other and within themselves that what either of them asserts is for the most part overturned if not by the individual party so asserting as it often is yet at least by the other of them one where or other in such wise that had some wiser man then my self had the management of this matter and work against them that is now under my hands see so much though minding matter more then method am carryed to the confutation of them into sundry other wayes of partly positive and partly polemical discourse intermingled among my examinations and comparings of their sayings that he need go no further then t.d and i.o to fetch matter wherewith to i.o and no further then j.o and t.d to confute t.d

conclude then my reply to the routing of the first rank and cashiering the first classe· of j.o's
scriptures urged in proof of the scriptures being the only most perfect standing rule and it may serve for an answer to t.d himself too in t.d words to me mutatis
pamph
to make the business short suppose we grant the scripture to be divinely inspired to be very useful and profitable as we do and to be written for the ends above specified in the scriptures mentioned yet will it not follow that it was intended for the rule to the church much less the only perfect rule or standard of faith and life because god did not give order for so to be but assured her before the scripture was at all as much as god thought sufficient to create and preserve faith in the gospel she had before she had it written in an outward letter viz the inward light word and spirit that was in the beginning from which the letter came
and to make a rule much more then the only rule exclusively of all other of all internal light word spirit revelation as jo and t.d both hold the scripture to be is necessary gods appointment of a writing to that end to which he did and even in the scripture it appears appoint the spirit and inward light and word as shew'd above but never at all appointed the scripture it self
and
of pam the difference lyes in god's arbitrary dispensation who from of old disposed the light word and spirit alone to be the rule without and before the letter as being far more excellent and fully sufficient without it as to the nature and being of a rule but never ordered intended designed appointed or established the writing alone as the rule as my two vniversity antagonists dispute without and clusively of the other
and as for the third and fourth classis of j.o's scriptures which seeing they are so near a kin to these of the first therefore shall consider them here before those of the second they are of the same kind so that the same general answer might satisfie sapienti cui verbum sat but seeing such stress is put on them by j.o to the stablishing of a wrong standard which of so great concernment to be stated right or else all the building faulters am free to insist a little more particularly on them then else need to do

they contain as thou sayest j.o commendations of the scriptures as to all uses of religion both by the practises and precepts of christ and the apostles

searching and expounding proving and trying all things by them themselves and also commending and commanding the searching of them and the trying of all things by them in and among all others

rep that all the places enumerated by thee do contain any such matter at all utterly deny for some of those thou citest as well as sundry of those afore spoken to neither expresly nor intentionally relate to the writing or scripture but onely to the word of god and the things and truth and commands of god written of onely in the letter which things in what text soever thou find'st them talkt of thou present'y run'st blundering on in thy wonted blindness which discerns no difference between the writing and things written interpreting them without more ado of the scripture as namely deut
whereby the words written in that book is not meant the writings but the therein rehearsed the ceremonials and morals of which they were to observe before that booke of deuteronomy was penn'd which is a story of moses his repetition by word of mouth a little before his death of such things as he had from the lord enjoined them to observe and some of them god also from his own mouth forty years at least before that was penned
also that in acts

where paul sayes he no other things or truths as to the substance and matter of them though the manner was different the one testifying de christo exhibendo the other exhibito one saying they should come t'other they were come then what the prophets and moses said should come which things paul could now witness were come if he had not seen their witness that they should and what mention is there of the scripture at all in that scripture also john
where its said of john baptist he was not that light but came to bear witness of that light which john baptist wrote no scripture at all that know of which light he testified to was not the letter or scripture but the same the qua bear witness to even that measure of its light within wherewith he inlightneth every man that comes into the world so that there is no scripture mentioned or so much as meant in that scripture
wherever thou seest in thy concordance the word scripture written of in the scripture thou art ready to think straightway it and hath no concordance with thy cause and where thou findest the words rule foundation law and prophets of god light word commands statutes testimony prophesie and such like thou as rashly and rawly imaginest the scripture or meer outward writing meant and mentioned by them in what ever is predicated of them and that it makes something for thy business of the scriptures being the only standing rule and foundation

but alas hoc aliquid verè nihil est this something is plainly nothing at all to that purpose for as it makes not a mice toward the proof thereof as appears above because the scriptures were written for good ends and are to such and such good uses unless god had canonized them as a rule so neither doth it that christ expounded the scriptures and that some did search them and were mightily read in them as some are at this day who are supposed to deny them to the confounding the scribes that searched them daily and therein lookt for life as their only rule but never came to him that they might have life who was the life and light they came from but never

heard him whom they testified of that his voice was now to be heard in whom god who under the law before his coming spake in his servants the prophets speaks under the gospel as by his only son

tis true abraham who lived long after moses and those prophets whose writings ye have were born in that parable which illustrates a precious truth that as to the mystery of it lyes yet hid from thee is brought in by christ as saying of the rich mans brethren by way of prevention of their coming into torment they have moses and the prophets let them hear them if not they'l not be perswaded by a miraculous message of one to them from the dead but what this to prove what thou here alledgest it for and more largely inferrest from it
where thou preachest on that text a sermon as long as little to thy purpose improving it and that of pet
to the utmost to prove moses and the prophets writings to be the best and most effectual means of bringing men to repentance on which that and all faith is immediately to be grounded and to prove the scriptures to be that alone which we are sent to to be more effectual and sure then either the greatest miracle that ever was or immediate voice that ever god himself spake by from heaven and to be the sole rule and determiner of all doctrines whether they be truths or but cunningly devised fables which two texts together with isa
how little they evince any such matter and what is meant in them by moses and the prophets and by that sure world of prophesie which thou and thy fellows foolishly affirm to be the scriptures shall god willing take occasion to examine anon
three of thy main inartificial arguments as thou truly callest them
or testimonies to thy untruth being by the head and shoulders without either sense or reason wrested from them

again it is true the bereans did search the scriptures whether the things were so as the apostles spake who spake nothing but summarily substantially the same which moses and the prophets did say should come but what though they did so of their own accord and their searching was succesful and useful also to the fortifying of the faith they had in the world of truth which they received readily not as the word of man but of god not as fables but as truth it coming to them as to the thessalonians not in word only but in power and the holy spirit and in much assurance thes
must it needs follow therefore that the scriptures were their only rule of determining the doctrines whether they were truths or fables the word of god or the word of man and that their faith and owning that truth was priori first originally and immediately founded as thou preachest all faith and repentance must be page
on the scriptures so that if they had not first searched the scriptures and there found a congruity of the things with the old writing they neither would nor could have beleeved or received the truth thus thou and most of thy faternity foolishly fancy but look again and ye will finde it far otherwise for howbeit they searched the scriptures and did commendably and nobly therein and were commended as more noble in that then they of thessalonica who yet are commended as noble excellent and exemplary as the other in receiving the word in much affliction with joy as gods and not mans word though it seems not so serious in searching the scriptures as these thess

and were not a little confirmed in their faith begotten before yet they first received the word with all readiness of

minde as hundreds do at ths day as preacht to them by word of mouth from the apostles the witness of god being reached and answering to the truth of it in their hearts in which they were noble as thessalonica was yet more noble by how much they were unwearied and uncessans in seeking to be more and more gradually and groundedly growing in fuller assurance of the truth as many are at this day who first beleeving and receiving the word with joy and readiness do not sleight as ye suppose but posteriori being in the faith timothy more seriously and singly then your selves see into the scriptures that being already brought into the things the scriptures write of through patience and comfort thereof have hope according to that other scripture of thy coating rom
as yourselves cannot have any more then the scribes who stand studying and sraping with your own animal understandings before ye are ceme to walk in the light and spirit they witness too and came from

but what's all this more then just nothing at all to prove the scripture to be the only standing rule of faith and life which is asserted of it to the evincing it to be the word nay if your eyes were in your head ye might see of your selves ye studentall more than truly prudential searchers of the scriptures that the word the apostles preached and the scripture which we confess truly testifies thereof are two distinct things and in no wise one and same individual as ye would make them if ye look no farther then the present text in hand for in that he sayes they received the word with all readiness of minde and searched the scriptvre whether the things were so it imports to any but the blind searchers of the scripture that the word they received was one thing and the scripture they searched about the truth of it was another
again it is true and not to be denied but apollo an eloquent iew was from his being well versed therein before he came to own the light mighty in the scripture and learned in the letter so as mightily to confound the gospel gain saying iews thereby when once he came to obey it himself though yet there was a tradesman and his wife further grounded in the gospel and learned in the light than himself who was beyond them in the letter of whom he was not ashamed as our vniversities literatists are at this day to learn of women that know more of gospel mysteries than they do to stoop to be instructed in the way of god more perfectly but how little this proves the scripture to be the only standing rule for which end i.o cites it he that is blinde cannot see but others cannot chuse when as he that was so well skilled in the scripture had that been the only rule that he could have instructed aquila and priscilla about the letter with which suo sejugulaus gladio he slew the iews as it were with their own sword was not so clear in his understanding of the truth way gospel spirit word and light of god which is indeed the only standing inalterable rule for ever as it ever was but that he had need to be regulated and rectified therein by such as in meer scripture all knowledge were as inferiour as they were superior to him in spiritual understanding

moreover what makes it to the proof of the scripture to be the only standing rule exclusively of the light and spirit that paul sayes to write the same things to the philippians by which its questionable whether he something to them before which is lost and not bound up in

your bibles nor canoniz'd into your canon was safe for them as much as if he had said nothing at all for nothing at all is that to i.o purpose nor yet that of iohn saying these things write unto you that your joy may be full which cites to the same end

and true it is christ expounded the scriptures to his disciples as he did also his own parables that he uttered by word of mouth amongst them and the mixt multitude and opened their understandings also as he does theirs that walk in his light that they might understand them but where is the immediate cogent consequence from hence to the conscience of any that the letter or scripture is the onely most perfect standing rule of all faith truth holy life doctrine divine worship as i.o states it to be and t.d also exclusively of the internal light word spirit
and what though we should grant you that christ sayes to the scribes search the scriptures well he might for they testifie of him as the life whom they never came to for it who if they had known either the scriptures aright they so search't in and scribled about or the power of god they could not have erred from the knowledge of him in his light as they did matth

we say the same to you schollars that think you study and know the scriptures more then any men as christ to them and as i.o to all by way of command whereas some can't read it in his to flourish his frontispiece and vent his vindication pro scripturis more then ought else undefined span alphabet search the scriptures for they testifie of christ the light the word that spirit way life truth we talk of they send ye to the same light and inward word in the heart as the rule to walk by as the qua do and as christ said of them ioh
having told them they needed no other to accuse them then moses in whom they trusted had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me but if ye believe not his writings how should ye believe my word so say of you ye need no other witness against you though ye have another even the light within which ye despise then the letter in which ye trust for did you believe the letter ye would believe in the light for it writes of the light the qua call ye to and write of but if ye believe not the writing ye so write for how shall ye believe in the light

howbeit when all's done as the word undefined span alphabet being both the indicative and imperative mood will as well bear it so the context doth much more clear it that the verb is rather indicative of their doting doings then imperasive of their duty and is rather to be rendred ye search then search ye the scripture and contains rather matter of condemnation of them for that profitable deal of do they made in their busie minds about the outward scriptures while in the mean time they heeded not gods own voice nor regarded the inward words abiding in them then either commendation of their great fruitless pains that way or commendation of the scripture to them to search or commandment of them who were too mad already for the scripture as their grand idol receiving it as thou faist
with the honour and veneration due to god and his living word alone to search therein
yea verily both that verse and those about it do all consist of matter of sad complaint against them for their the scripture and negecting to receive or rather refusing and rejecting the word of life it self to any single eye ye

have saith christ to them of the father neither hear his voice at any time nor seen his shepe joh
and
ye have not his word abiding in you vers
ye search the scriptures ye look there often for in them ye think but mistake your selves to have eternal life and true enough they are they which testifie of me as the way to life and yet ye will not come to me that ye might have the life
on this wise doth christ rather expostulate with them for their ignorance and negligence of the word then either command or commend any searchings of the scriptures

and as to the second classis of texts cited by the j.o in proof of the scriptures being the only standing rule in which texts all additions whatsoever to the written word of god are expresly rejected answer what though god doth reprove condemn threaten to plague and curse such as adde to his word bring any other gospel then what paul preached make void his commands by their traditions enjoyn men to seek not to such as peep and mutter but to the lord himself paul would not have the corinthians think of him and apollo above what he writes of himself and him as men only by whom as means they beleeved which is the summe of the seven scriptures by thee produced to that purpose what proof at all is there in all this such a way it is true enough there must be no adding to the word gospel commandement testimony of god or alterings or varyings or detractings therefrom in a tittle but is any of this intended of the outward writing letter or scripture which are not that word gospel commandement but only declare this and other things concerning it is the scripture that only set firm fixt standing rule that may neither be augmented nor diminished on pain of plagues and cursing as ye say it is then tell me
how much scripture or writing hath been added to the five books of moses since deut
was written wherein it is said ye shall not adde to the word command you neither shall you diminish from it and since that of prov was written where it is said adde thou not unto his word lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar and since isa
where it is said to the law and testimony and since that gal where it is said let him be accursed that brings other then we have preacht though we or an angel from heaven
whether were the prophets and apostles that have added so many books since those prohibitions justly reproveable and accursed as lyars
if ye say nay they were not lyars nor to be reproved nor accursed then tell me as to the measure and bounds and close of your canon which ye suppose to be the revelation why he that by the same spirit moving shall in writing reveal the same truths now is accursed reproved plagued for adding to the word and gospel upon the account of johns saying rev
if any man shall adde unto these things god shall adde unto him the plagues that are written in this booke any more then iohn himself who added his scripture and revelation after pauls epistle to the galathians or paul who added his scriptures after isaiahs or isaiah and the other prophets who added theirs after solomon or solomon that added his writings after inhibition in deuteronomy


beleeve it that the scripture is not that thing nor standing rule to which no more must be added and from which no new scripture may be diminished on pain of cursing and plagues but the word doctrine gospel commandement law truth told in it to which cursed be he that addes another or any new word gospel doctrines or detracts a tittle from that and so john sayes if any adde to these things and take away from the words of this book god shall adde plagues and take away his part out of the book of life and from the things written in this book meaning that particular writing he was now in hand with not if any man shall write any more scripture with so high a pretence as by revelation from the spirit or loose or shut out any of the scriptures that are already written by inspiration from the canon for if he had meant so then as brisk as ye are to breath out threatnings and plagues and curses to such as pretend to write any thing by inspiration revelation or motion from the holy spirit since the dayes of the complearing and closing of your canon as you call it which you count from iohns writing his revelation though ye are far from adding any inspired scripture to the bible but only such scripture as is the fruit figment and imagination of your own hearts which thou confessest to be the fountain of all that other men that are not apostles as ye say ye are not do deliver
not daring to pretend to the infallible guidance of the infallible spirit in your ministry yet yee'l not scape the taking your names out of the book of life and from the good things written in the revelation for your fault of taking away detracting and diminishing from the scriptures for ye exclude from your canon very much of that inspired scripture that was written some of which is extant at this day too or hath been shewed before
but considering the nature and true being of your guilt confess in this case of varying from the rule if that were the onely standing rule of the outward scripture should be found to be much more in the ablative than in the dative case
but of this more hereafter

these are j.os inartificial arguments or testimonies of scripture used by him as mediums of artificial ones that may be drawn from thence of which scriptures he affirms that they are as commonly cited so already vindicated nosi theologis by our divines from exceptions of papists and others that hee need not insist any more on them to name them of which say as he communiter citantur nonproprie they are commonly but not properly cited but not yet vindicated from the exceptions of all
shall now come to consider his more artificial arguments drawn some of these and some other scriptures by the cart ropes of j.os
carnal reasonings in proof that the inward light word spirit and its revelations are not at all but the outward letter text writings scriptures are only and altogether the standing rule to the church and all men of all truthss doctrines and things that are to be done beleeved tried or determined in point of gods worship and our obedience

j.o arg
the first is on this wise ex

si revelatio
if the revelation of the will of god in the scripture be so perfect compleat and every way absolute that there is no need of any other revelation by the spirit and light within enthusiasm heavenly breathing

discsurses with angels fained or true to instruct us in the knowledge of god in order the attaining

eternal life then its plain that all those wayes and means of knowing god and his will which the fanaticks fain to be the means thereof are uncertain dangerous unprofitable and in no wise necessary thereunto and therefore to be rejected and detested

but its so
therefore

rep oh full of all fallacy as well as falsity folly and blindness in the things of god of whom may truly say et si non cause thou art not so little honest in it but thou art as much crafty to hide what thou canst the dishonesty of what thou holdest not only from the qua as thou thinkest in the latine language but also from all that would handle thee for thy ill by thy dark discoursing in words of a double and doubtful reference and signification that thou mayest the more privily pervert the right wayes of the lord and prepagate thy perverse propositions the more securely to the prejudice of them

what means else thy foisting in of that foolish phrase quae simulant fanatici by the inserting whereof thou mayest either intend thus viz that all wayes that are fained by the qua are unprofitable unnecessary and to be rejected and detested and so creep thy neck out of the collar and shelter thy self from that censure of falshood thou would else befall the minor for meer fained mediums of knowing god and his will wherever found are to be rejected as useless unnecessary and no less then detestable indeed that is true enough who doubts it but then withall how serpent wouldest thou hereby subtilly insinuate it into the younger sort to whose use thou devotest this thy peece of dotage under that vnive vendible title of theological determinations theses or apologetical exercitations pro as if the qua professed means were but a fained light and spirit as if thou foughtest against nought but the qua fictions and not any true internal light or spirit of god or heavenly revelations or inspirations but only such meer imaginary spiritual divine motions and notions as the qua fain or falsely fancy so to be
whereas no figmentitions matters are found formented or sought for by the qua to be the rule but only the true revelations light and spirit of god himself within the heart

or else thou mayest intend thus as thy words express that forenamed clouding clause being excluded viz
that the scriptures alone make such an absolutely perfect revelation of gods will that there is no need at all of any other revelation by the spirit and light of god within which the qua affirm to be useful and needful to instruct in the knowledge of god and his will to the attainment of life eternal but those are uncertain perillous unnecessary means of knowing our duty and so to be rejected and detested in which way understanding thy minde there is so much the less fallacy indeed but the more falsely even so much as amounts to little less then great blasohemy and so thy minor is to be denied with a witness ex duobus malis absurdis hisie unum saltem est elegondum utrum horum mavis accipe if the first which is fallacy and foolery its the least and the best yet too bad if the last

which is falshood and blasphemy its so bad that its worse then nought yet judging by thy undertaking to prove thy minor which else were true and needing no proof thou intendest the letter which is the greater of the evils enter the lists with thee about that and deny utterly thy minor which thou proceedst in proof of by man particular confiderations viz
of the author of the scriptures namely god from whom sayest thou nothing can come that is imperfect any way much less in respect of that end to which he decrees any j.o from a perfect voluntary cause nothing but what is perfect is to be expected for nothing could hinder god being willing to reveal his will from revealing it perfectly but either because he could not which is not consistent with his infinite wisdome and omnipotency or because he would not which in no wise agrees with his goodness and grace therefore he hath given out a perfect revelation of his will

reply
this is the first medium whereby thou seem'st to thy self artificially to have proved the minor of thy first argument for the scriptures being such an onely absolutely perfect rule and revelation of god and his will that there's now no need of any other way of revelation either of him or it but all else whatsoever by his spirit and light within as in order to the knowing of god his will and our duty to him and our obtaining eternal life beside the scriptures are superfluous uselesse needlesse unprofitable fictitious and to be rejected as such with abhorrency and detestation
and this minor of thy prosyllogism should haue been thy expresse conclusion in thy last argument instead whereof being likely ashamed to infer it in its proper terms they are so fordid fottish false foolish blinde brutish beastly blasphemous grosly detestable and abominable thou entailest a conclusion at the tail of it which is not contradicted by any but aliud a negato quite another thing then that which is denyed yea even the same that we and all other men own viz
that god hath given out a perfect revelation of his will which who doubts of who denies but that god gives out his will certainly sufficiently to all men but whether that revelation of his will be made to all men by a meer letter without so certainly perfectly at this day that in order to knowing and doing it by every man savingly his light and spirit within is superfluous needlesse unnecessary uncertain and no less then fictitious and odious to assert needful which is the lye thou labourest to defend or by his light word and spirit within certainly and perfectly sufficiently to every individual in order to his doing his own duty without an outward letter or writing as it was before any writing was and is still where no such writing is and no less so where such writing is also which is the truth the qua maintain against thee this is the question between thee i.o and the qua which thou rovest and ramblest from making premises which pretend to have promises in them of proving thy absurd opinion and then concluding at random that which nihil ad rhombum just nothing at all to thy purpose insomuch that as an old cardinal that had been long absent from rome going once to the election of a pope and seeing such shuffling and patching and and shifting and and daubing doings in a business of such moment as the choice of the infallible for the whole church said no more but siccine eliguntur pontifices romani and so took his horse and rode away turning his back upon rome resolving never to see it more so seeing

how little logical the theological disputations of our vniversity doctors in divinity are and what pinching and cutting and curtailing and serpentine twining and turning things upside down and shifting and shuffling to shut out the plain truth as held out to them by honest country qua and to escape the force of the two edged sword of the spirit or word of god from wounding their hairy scalp what moping and mincing and mangonizing there is among them who having left off to walk by gods right rules cannot walk well nor keep close to their own wrong rules neither is it enough to make any countrified schollars that have long discontinued from the vniversities ashamed and sorry and sick to see such sorry doings at the nursing mothers and to say siccine disputant academici nostrates do our modern doctors dispute thus at the vniversities surely wee'l never look after them more nor send our sons thither to learn logick or train them up there to know honestly and uprightly and rightly how to reason much less to make them ministers of the gospel

but to let the illegitimacy of the conclusion pass and suppose it to have been expressed in its own due terms let's see how it will follow from those premises he infers it from that the letter without the light and spirit within memorandum still that he stiles those most blasphemously uncertain perillous unprofitable and in no wise necessary means of knowing gods will and our duty and of coming to life and such as are to be rejected and detested as fictitious and counterfeit is the onely perfect rule of revelation of gods will any more then from the self same premises it will follow contrarily to him that the light and spirit within are the only perfect certain sufficient rule of revealing gods will without the letter or scripture without
surely had i.o been magister avtis his in this his arteficial argument he would have left it out altogether and not have urged it as he doth to the prejudice of his cause for it doth him ten times more detriment then advantage

for whereas it is generally concluded among you all and by you two i.o and t.d my present antagonists in particular as much by any

yet you both vilifie the the said inward light what ye are able under the names of natural obscure darks dim low and to salvation insufficient principles and means of the revelation of his will

imagination figment nescio quid nihil meer dictates of our own conscience blinde and corrupt that god declares and reveals himself his soveraign power authority righteousness holiness good and evil many sins and duties and several divine attributes and that indispensible moral obedience which he requireth of us as his creatures subject to his law by some light from himself and principles of conscience and his own voyce therein and those motions that are inlaid by his own hand in mens mindes and that they make a revelation of him as to the purposes mentioned and shew the work of his own law written in mens hearts and are able to plead their own divine original and discover their author from whom they are and in whose name they speak even gods without any other witnesses further evidence or reasoning without the advantage of any considerations but what are by themselves supplied without the least contribution or assistance from without

whereas say all this is granted by you of the inward light we plead for to be a profitable perfect sufficient rule of knowing god and

means of revealing of his will to us and our duty to him in order to life without a letter against you who plead the scripture and letter only to be so without the inner spirit and light to say nothing how in effect the cause is little less than wholly or rather is wholly given us by t.d and thy self too in those many magnifications of the light within as effectual without any thing but it self and therefore without the scripture without to reveal god and his will and sins and duties and good and evil and that moral obedience due from us to his moral law is not thy own argument for the propounded perfection of the scriptures as the only rule ab earum authore deo scilicet quo nihil imperfectum modo multò minus respectu finis cui opus quodcunque destinat procedere potest as yea far more cogent and conclusive to the inward light and spirits being the said only allsufficent perfect rule then to the outward letters being so

and settest thy self so preposterously to prove the said perfection of the only rule as proper and peculiar to the letter may not much more properly take thy own words and therewith ad hominem argue that the name of the only rule is the peculiar right and priviledge of the inward light and spirit as thou then sayest jam vero perfectionem dictam scripturarum so tuo te jugulans gladio say jam vero perfectionem dictam lucis spiritus interni probamus ab authore deo scilicet the said perfection of the only rule and way of revelation of his will and our duty as to life as proper and peculiar to the inward light and spirit and not the scripture prove from their author viz
god from whom nothing imperfect in any way can come much less in respect of that end to which he hath designed any work
and if thou say as thou doest and deny it not in a more remote sense god is the author of the scripture let me ask thee is he not much more immediately the author of his light and spirit in the hearts of holy men and of that measure thereof that is and strives and shines in the hearts of all men from the greater degree of which in the prophets and apostles hearts all the other scripture except that little exod
and dan

came through their hands as subordinate authors then he is of the letter which issued from him non nisi mediantibus manuscripteribus more mediately and no otherwise at first but by means of men writing as moved and at this day no more immediately then by the pens and presses of fallible men transcribing and printing translating and copying them out of they know not what corrupted copies not so near as at second or third but perhaps at the hundreth hand from the first penman and seeing god is the sole immediate author of the light and spirit within which is not alterable flexible at the wills of criticks as thou confessest the hebrew text is and as he is not of the letter which is both copied canonized and authorized as ye have it by men only as the rule it follow as secundum ye it doth not me ab authore remoto from the remote author of it god from whom nothing imperfect can come that the letter is the only perfect rule and revelation of gods will will it not much more forcibly follow from gods being the only and immediate author of the inner light and spirit that they are the only sufficient rule and make a perfect revelation of his will to the end and purposes aforesaid

ob
and if thou say true but those ends and purposes for which the

light and spirit within the qua talk of though useful otherwise are designed of god and given to men are not that they may be the rule and guide of our way in order unto life but only that thereby we may the more savingly understand the letter which is of god designed decreed and authorized to be the only rule for so thou expresly saist of the spirit or light within ex

which expediencies sake shall here take into consideration that may have no more to do with it again where thy latine words englished are these

j.o
of no inward light whatsoever although it be saving is this the use or end that we should attend to it as the guide and rule of our way but for this end alone is that vouchsafed of god that by the help thereof we may the more savingly understand that rule meaning the scripture and the minde of god revealed in it

reply
answer cujus contrarium verum est this is as quite contrary a with the heels upwards and upside downwards as tis well possible for a man to build whereby thou makest as thou elsewhere doest in know not how many places more the light and spirit but an instrumental means to bring men to the letter that by the letter they may have life and be saved yea and sometimes the servile instrument of the letter it self by which as by some certain ministerial attorny the letter authoritatively as the cause doth all the mighty and powerful things that are effected towards mans salvation as namely

this light in the scripture for which wee contend
reply
but stay there yet a while too j.o for the light in the scripture is that the quá contend for against thee who contendest for the letter if thou well understandest thy self against that light which is declared of in the letter as shining in the heart for the light in the scripture is one thing of which what thou sayest is true but the scripture in which that light is declared and written of is another as the beaming majesty brightness and glorious light of the sun that shines through it is one thing and the glass window in and through which it shines is another the light in the lanthorn one thing and the lanthorn in which it shines is another which light that in the letter declared is that we plead for and j.o against this j.o wil see when he looks over the second time with his eyes open what with his eyes shut at first he overlookt secundae cogitationes saepe meliores
j.o
this light in the scripture is nothing but the beaming of the majesty truth holiness and authority of god by this it dives i.e the letter by the light dives into the consciences of men into all the recesses of their hearts guides teaches directs determines in themin the name majesty and authority of god
rep see how the light is made the letters messenger subordinate agent for by here is not such a by as is used when the inferior is said to act by the authority of the superior but the superior by the of the inferior

whereas indeed the letter is but the instrument of the light and spirit whereby the light spirit do supreamly and authoritatively what ever they do by it at all can do without it even what sometimes they do with since it is in being and where it hath a being for the light tries searches shines shews reveals judges determines as well without the letter as with it and did dive into the heart where the letter never was and direct there before

the external literal directory was all and yet uses its pleasure the letter as its instrument and as a knife to kill which knife yet as an instrument cannot quicken but the letter doth not enter quâ talis into the heart at all and what ere it doth it doth in subserviency to the light which is its author whose instrument it is to use but not the light its instrument at all

moreover the end of the letter is but to turn men from the darkness and power of satan wherein they dwel to the light within them that shines in the darknes that is also within them which light is the power of god this act

is said to be the end of pauls ministration which was performed partly by writing and partly by word of mouth that so by beleeving in the light and living in it they might not abide in the darkness but have the light of life but the end of the light and spirit within is not to bring to the letter by the letter we may have the life for the searchers into the letter and lookers thereinto for the eternal life which is christ whom the letter testifies of never found the life they lookt for there because they heard not gods voice nor cared for his word abiding in them nor came to christ the light and spirit that they might have the life for the letter killeth but the light and spirit gives the life cor
and howbeit deny not the scripture to be perfect praesertim respectu finis especially in relation to that end as sayes for which it was decreed of god yet that that end was to be the only guide and rule of men in their way to life deny asserting the light and spirit still as that which is designed and ordered of god as to that end and was so from the beginning before any letter without was at all and though own the scripture still as useful profitable effectual sufficient and perfectly successful where used by the man of god in the wisdome of god for the many excellent ends and uses formerly spoken to from tim

as being written by inspiration of god yet still deny that to be thereupon the standing rule as the light and spirit is because no where so denominated nor designed to be by god in all the scripture as have shewed above in answer to all the texts whence thou mistakest it so to be and because damnati lingua vocem habet vim non habet a hereticks words are never heeded
must here make use again of t.d to defeat i.o who sayes
of his first pamph
of his second
that all that was written by holy men and preserved for our use is not therefore our standing rule because god did not intend them nor give order for them to be so and beside such inspiration and usefulness to make a rule is necessary gods appointment of a writing to that end which appointment the letter never had from god what ever it had from men the difference lyes in gods dispensation who assured his church what was sufficient as to her standing rule before the letter was viz his his light and spirit in which regard though we highly respect the letter yet we can look upon it as
first pamph
t.d sayes of some useful things of god with reference to othersome no more with such regard as the only standing rule as we do upon the other

and though with thee i.o we assert and deny not but that by the efficacy of the light and spirit the letter is more savingly understood for the spirit well knows its own yea by the light and spirit only is the letter understood and read to profit and not by that twinckling twilight of thy fidling

fancy for that ignis fatuus finds little as to the inside of the letter but fuell to feed thee in fierce and fiery twittle twattles about the outside sense of it and the truth of transcripts and translations pidling points tittles iota's yea who hath known the minde of the lord or the things of the spirit declared in the letter but the spirit and they that live after the light thereof and no more after the flesh to whom only the spirit only doth reveal them yet monstrum horrendum cui lumen ademptum what scriptureless lightless spiritless speeches are these of j.o who depresses all inward light whatsoever even that within the living word of god within so much below the meer letter formally considered as an outward writing and abstract from these as to assert them from which the letter had all the being it hath and that thousands of years after all these antient rules and lights that are to day and yesterday and for ever the same without the least shadow of alteration had been famous in the world among all the worthies from abel to moses to have all their being from god to us ward meerly for the sake of the letter which was but of yesterday and as well every day as every way mutable and that so easily that tis done in a time in but the turning of a hand yea by the transposing of letters heb
points and like

as himself asserteth as many various lections may be in its several copies welnigh as lines and to represent all these which gave the letter the being of a certain sub sub unto themselves as subservient unto it as if they were of and for no other use nor end in the world but to teach men to come not to god himself for life but to the letter and to read the book call'd the bible which doth but imminde men that forget them to minde the light and spirit
shall therefore only take this tale of j.o mutatis mutandis transform it by a transposition of the two subjects thereof viz the light and letter which i.o hath mis used and each into its proper place use and order and so quite quit it here nullius literae externae cujuscunque tandem in plain english thus of no external letter whatsoever although the holy scripture it self which j.o calls saving is this the use and end that we should attend to it as to the guide of our way and rule but to this end only is it graciously granted of god that by means thereof we may perceive to our salvation that rule i.e the spirit light and word of god ad intra and the minde of god revealed therein
in this translation is no truth hid that shall not be revealed nor covered that shall not be known so having turned j.os
babel with the bottome upwards shall let it stand and pass on about my business concluding against thee i.o in thy own words for the light and spirit to be that rule thou sayest the letter is from its perfection ab authore

a causa perfecta
from a perfect voluntary cause nothing but what is perfect can be expected for nothing can hinder god being willing to reveal his will from revealing it perfectly as before the letter was so now where the letter is

not among heathens by his light and spirit by which thou confessest he reveals it very far in the words forecited but either because he cannot which denies his infinite wisdome and omnipotency or because he will not which agrees not with his goodness and grace

therefore god hath and doth give out by his light and spirit within a perfect revelation of his will so that they consequently must be secundum te by thy own argument j.o the only perfect standing rule for there are not two so far is the letter that came from them from being so as thy fancy fancies it to be alone and exclusively of them as uncertain useless needless perillous and detestable
the second medium by which thou goest about to prove the foresaid conclusion viz
that the letter or scriptures are the only perfect rule revelation of god his will and our duty that gives to know him to eternal life and not the spirit and light which as enthusiasm dubious useless figment are with thee to be detested is a naturâ librorum sacrae scripturae from the nature of the books of the holy scripture which are sayest thou those of the old and new testament so sayest thou the apostle clearly dilates of the old testament
in the reading of the old testament of the new there's the same reason vers
now every testament sayest thou alluding to but not quoting gal

though but a mans is perfect and being once confirmed no man disanulleth or superaddeth thereunto

never did discern such absolute proceed from a professed doctor as do from j.o thick and threefold in the very cause he prosecutes whose proofs of his own producing do as frequently confound him and as fully foil him as to the matter he would prove thereby as any that can likely be produced against him by those he opposes and yet verily beleeve he speaks the sense wellnigh of the whole vniversity it self in which he hath in the late clawing cringing corresponding and climing times atchieved to become a chieftane

and that it may appear lets reason j.o hereabout a little with thee let me ask thee is the gospel is the new testament letter scripture external text and outward writing as the old testament is is it such a passing perishing dark low obscure thing as writing or graving of points tittles and iotaes in tables of stone though with the singer of god himself much more it such a mouldring matter for so thy self callest the most original copies of the external text of the holy scripture that ever was in the world
and therefore well may so call thy best bare transcribed copies of it as writings with inke and stamping with in roles and books and papers and parchments with press hands and tools which cannot be preserved so long as from ezra till now from mouldring without a miracle is the gospel the new testament no more than such as thou talkest

of is it undefined span alphabet typography which meer men can take and turn and translate and tumble to and fro and transcribe and tear and dash out and do what they will with is it outward writings of epistles and recommendations and histories and letters as that of paul to philemon about private personal and domestick affairs and such like is it not an epistle of christ in the table of the heart though ministred sometimes by man at the motion of his spirit or if a writing yet not with inke but with the spirit of the living god in fleshly tables of the heart cor
is is as the old testament as all meer writing ad extra only is whether of old or since christ and all outward undefined span alphabet or letter only that cannot quicken nor cure but killeth such as serve as thou yet doest in the oldness of it is it not spirit light and life is it not the words of christ spoken by the lord himself alone which are spirit and life in newness of which the true children of the new covenant that are more then bastards that pretend to it do serve and not in the oldness of a letter or that old way of the old scribes that came no nearer to christ the life then the outside of the outward scripture which was wrote of him is it any of these things are not these the best instruments of the old testament foolish shepherds wherewith for a time they were suffered to feed who made the poor of the flock the flock of the slaughter taken up again since christ directly beside the intent of christ and such as wrote the later scriptures by our idol shepherds that leave the flock to starve so they can be better fed themselves who are not behinde those of old in feeding with gall and wormwood the flock of the slaughter in not pitying but slaying them and yet holding themselves not guilty for which the sword of the lord is now upon their arm and upon their right eye so that their arm or power is now to be clean dryed up and their right eye utterly darkned

ah poor of your people that by custome and tradition from your mouths who take it so to be by tradition from your are now naturallized into a naming the naked dead letter by the name of the living word of the living god and the four and copies of matthew mark luke and iohns manuscript of what christ did in that body wherein he was born at bethlehem and dyed at ierusalem by the name of the gospel and those four bare books with the rest of those few that follow fardelled together with them in what fashion men most fancy and bound up as the bible sellers please by the name of the new testament

so thou talkest i.o telling the world of the nature of the books of the scripture as ye now have it is this they are the old testament and the new so thou intendest in thy saying sunt autem veteris novi testamenti

citing paul who calls the books of moses the old testament cor
as ll well he might for the old testament was indeed undefined span alphabet letter or writing writen with inke and pen or ingraven outwardly on tables of stone and not spirit or writing with the spirit of the living god in the fleshly tables of the heart as the new is which the saints are under who are therefore said to serve rom
not in the oldness undefined span alphabet of the letter but in the

newness undefined span alphabet of the spirit
and then secondly asserting that novi testamenti est the case is the same between the old testament and the new which is most false as to the thing in hand and
citing cor
in proof of it by which thou shewest thy folly for thou couldest not have well found out a fitter text for its disproof whether thou who citest it for borest to set it down yea or nay for fear its should be seen how far it contradicts what thou citest it for will not say but am sure a man that is but minded to miss the meaning of it may run and read how that verse subverts the busines thou bringest it in for yea verily so far is that apostle who truly calls the old testament by the names of book heb
and letter written engraven in stones and such like from affirming with thee that the case is the same with the new testament as to the name and nature thereof that both in that verse and in the third also he more then intimates yea plainly expresses that of the old and new testament in that particular more than any est the case is diverse yea so far different that he flatly opposes the one to the other as things that however agreeing otherwise viz in their being both glorious in som degree though the new in a far greater degree then the other as a beautiful picture may agree in respect of beauty glory comeliness and compleat resemblance in some degree with the substantial person that is it of yet in this that the one is letter outward writing printing and ingraving visible and legible by the outward eye the other not so but internal invisible spiritual written with the spirit in the heart yea spirit it self which while the letter is dead and killing is only living quickning and giving life

yea two varying ministration doth the apostle make them not as one is that of death and condemnation to the children of it of whom on pain of perishing it requires the living of a life which it gives no ability to and which the other the spirit only gives and inables to live the other that of spirit life liberty righteousness glory but also as the one that is the old is a writing ad extra only the other that is the new a writing a scripture only ad intra though written of by that without that he absolutely asserts a present inconsistency since the doing away of the old between a mans being a minister now of both as once and that posita novo tollitur vetus the new being now come in full force and confirmed by the testators death the old testament and its ministry is disanulled in regard of its weakness and unprofitableness however profitable as a type in its time for many uses to bring immediately to the life so that he who is the minister of the one i.e of the old testament i.e of the letter outward writing text or scripture is not a minister of the other i.e of the new i.e of the gospel righteousness glory liberty life and spirit and retro he who is a true minister of the gospel or new testament as now standing in the force and substance it self out of the figure and shadows wherewith it was vailed of old is not though he may utter things as moved of the spirit that are written in the letter as christ himself and the apostles did a minister of the old as the old jer

here is not all nor yet not half of that absurdity and falshood that i.o in his folly flings abroad in that small parcel above which am yet under the animadversion of for whereas he sayes am vero omne testamentum est perfectum every testament is perfect intending it both of the old testament and the new and not only so but of such a perfection as avails in hunc finens ut assequamur vitam aeternam to this very end viz the obtaining the life eternal it self for so is his assertion of the books of the scriptures which he describes as to their nature and concludes under that name of the old and new testament his is so wofully false that himself is as wonderfully foolish who sees it not flatly contradictory to the scripture for howbeit the very old testament or outward letter is duly owned by us to be a ministration of god from whom nothing can come as is abovesaid but what is perfect praesertim respectu finis cui opus quodcunque deflinat in reference to that end for which he appoints it absolutely perfect to that end for which it is given forth of god which is to be an a or elementary help or outward worldly rudiment to indoctrinate younglings in their nage concerning the inward light and spirit as the only way that leads to christ the life from whom the light comes and is lent as a line or clew of thread that followed conducts through the valley and shadow of death to the life it self in which respect the letter of the law is called a tutor governour under whose tuition the under aged imbondaged ignorant ones may be trained up into a true understanding of the truth as it is in as by a shadow type figure festraw or finger that points the primarian professors more distinctly to that they are to eye and aim at more then it self and by such as are in the faith and obedience to the light may be used too to make them wiser toward salvation and more perfectly every good work as he that is past a novice and is become a scholar can and may but must is another matter read in the as well and better than when he learned in it yet as to its being so omnibus numeris absoluta perfecta as thou bablest making it so perfect as to bring to the life that is a meer antiscriptural fiction of thy own fancy for though a man may by the learning become the more dispositively fitted to read in the bible and other books of latine or logick and so by degrees come at last to the capacity and degree of a doctor in the yet he that shall say the is per saltum perfect to this end that without need of reading or learning any other books a person may by it alone become capable immediately of dr in divinity shall by my consent be counted as ridiculous silly and senseless as such as side with j.o sayings are who say of the scripture or letter alone exclusively of the spirit and light within it calls to walk in that by it men may have the life it gives the life it is the only most perfect standing rule of faith and life yea is so perfect and absolu in all respects that there is no need of any other revelation by the spirit or light within to instruct us in the knowledge of god and

our duty to this end that we may obtaine eternal life yea all these means of knewing god and his will are uncertain dangerous unprofitable in no wise necessary and therefore to be rejected and detested as fanatick figment

for the foresaid of the in his hyperbolical adoration of it would be as contrary to common sense and reason as i.o and t.d in their absolute admirations of the scripture and abominations of the spirit and light within for its sake are both to sense and reason and the common testimony of the scripture it self also which testifies every where concerning the old testament or letter which confess to be profitable perfect and absolutely able to the ends and uses of gods appointment as a typical testimony of those things which were to be spoken after that is weake imperfect and unprofitable as to that end for which i·o asserts it per salium to be so absolutely able powerful and perfect to that is to say to salvation and eternal life for it faith that it is the light and spirit that give the life and the liberty from the lust and sin to which the mother that is under the old testament or letter of the law is yet in bondage with her children and that the old testament or letter lyes only in eatings and drinkings and diverse baptisms and carnal ordinance imposed only till the time of reformation heb in weakè and beggerly rudiments or elements of the world unto which who having once begun in the spirit are aside to are foolish and bewitched and disobedient to the truth and do but think in vain to be made perfect by the flesh and desire again to be in bondage and know not yet christ formed in them but know him only outwardly and after the flesh gal

are iews outwardly only not truly nor inwardly nor circumcised with the circumcision made without hands which is that of the heart in the spirit not of letter whose praise is not of men but of god but concis'd and according to the outward bodily exercises found in the letter loving the praise of men more than the praise of god and according to the law of a carnal commandement not the inward worship of god in spirit nor after the power of that endless life the light leads to

that there is a disanulling of the commandement going before which was attendance to an outward letter because of the weakness and unprofitablness thereof because it could make nothing perfect but only was the ushering in of a better hope even of the light and spirit by which we may draw nigh to god who is light heb
and with whom no letter lauder that lives beside the light the mystery of the letter also can have any fellowship at al
and lastly as to thy saying that every testament if it be but mans is perfect so that when once confirmed none may disanul or to it

answer no perfect testament is to be dianulled when confirmed and in

full force as it is only by the death of the testator but that shews thy assertion to be false who that every testament is perfect inasmuch as the old testament or letter was disanulled which secundum te could not have been if it had been perfect and so omnibus numeris absolute as thou sayest in regard of the weakness unprofitableness of it to bring to life and for the the faultiness and imperfection of the first god himself whose testament it was dedicated with the blood of bulls goats lambs and calves for the time then being only undefined span alphabet as intended for a while only twas called a ceremony takes it away that he might establish the second heb
that is perfect to the giving of the life which is ignorantly asserted by thee of the letter for the letter that was perfect to its own end as a shadow was altogether imperfect thereunto

and that nothing is to be added to any testament once come in full force and vertue by the death of the testator as all testaments do then and never till then for heb
where a testament is there must of necessity also be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men be dead otherwise it is of no strength at all whilst the testator liveth this freely grant as a truth but utterly overturns all thou contendest for which that is the books of the apostles and evangelists which were all written after christ the testators death are the new testament which how they can possibly be if thy own position be true as it is that to a testament if but mans when confirmed as it only and alwayes is by the testators death much more god's new testament after once confirmed by the death of christ the testator as it was before one letter of that scripture thou callest the new testament as written nothing must be added thereto let all who are not void of judgement judge
for if the writings of the apostles and which were all added and penned after christs death the testator of it by whose death it came into full force and strength be the new testament an outward literal declaration of which new testament know it is as the writings of moses and the prophets also are both which are but the letter undefined span alphabet or old testament that in an external way declares the new with this difference only that the writing before christ declared chrisiumexihibendum those since chrisium exhibitum the first christ to be offered the later christ already offered say if these later be the new testament then either one or both of these two absurdities must be owned viz that there hath been where there should have been none a superadding of very much to the new testament or rather secondly that the whole new testament was it self made since it was ratified and confirmed by the testators death

the minor of this argument which deny hath a whole troop of testimonies or texts of scripture pressed to attend the proof thereof which i.o takes to be such a trusty and most of them are so to the qua cause concerning the light word and spirit within that there is no doing any thing in denial thereof that can reach to the rendring of it untrue but unless it be some one or two of them that mention the letter as profitable in a way that will prove little to his purpose the rest will frustrate his expectation of assistance from them sail him fal in with us neither expressing nor implying any such matter as the scripture as he supposes but intending all the very truth we contend for against him viz
the efficacy profitable and powerful operation of the inward light word and spirit of god which he ironically glories over as inania inutilia incerta minime necessaria fictitia rejicienda detestanda and such like

as have shewed above which though they do speak of the outward scriptures being useful profitable and comfortable to the saints yet prove them not to be therefore the only perfect standing rule of faith and life for the reason rendred by t.d why all scripture that is by inspiration is not so because to make a rule is necessary gods appointment of writings to that end pag
of his

the first of i.os
twelve texts ten whereof nor talk of nor intend nor mention nor mean the sripture at all viz ps
it hath been talkt with already above where have shewed that the law of god which is therefore said to be a restituens animam restoring and converting the soul is the light the letter speaks of and not the letter it self which any but a blinde man may see for what letter was written when david wrote this very little more then the books of moses which i.o himself and all men to be but the old testament which is but the letter that killeth for is that outward letter of the apostles and evangelists were the new testament as they call it yet none of that was in being till above a thousand years after david and the old testament that was in his dayes is now abolished

neither it nor the letter nor outward statutes and judgements of it being given to any but jacob or israel after the flesh as a type of the new testament or covenant that is now made good to israel after the spirit but that text say hath been unfolded enough before so that though meet with it again here as have done twice before and whether may again or no it matters not but sure am that some scriptures thou citest four and some five or six times over at least in thy book how much more know not in proof of the scriptures being this and that which testifie no one tittle of any thing concerning the scriptures at all so dry are our doctors and divines drawn and nearly driven to finde out furniture in the scripture in defence of their false faith and meer figments about the scripture shall meddle no mo more with it here nor with the second that are sufficiently forespoken to though they both speak something as good as nothing to thy cause concerning the outward scriptures viz rom
tim

as for the other nine they all with one consent and more that elsewhere thou cotest do declare the authority efficacy light and power of the word of god within which both the qua and the scriptures bear one and the testimony to but predicate nothing at all of the scriptures which nine together with the rest that are coincident therewith and truly cogent to all mens consciences as concerning the witness they give to the inward word the outward letter relates of shall here take under consideration in what order is not very much material

is that which leaves without cloak or excuse in their sins joh
and that the word that god by christ the light and christ by his spirit and light in the conscience speaks is that which who so beleeves in and hears abides not in darkness or errour but comes to know the truth that sets him free from the law of sin and death and brings to life and who hears not or hears and beleeves not or receives not but rejects shall be judged by at the last day according to joh
this do not deny for this is it and not the letter here as it is sometimes used as the lights instrument which was never in the heart how much less the letter chiefly only authoritatively exclusively of any other

who saith christ cleanseth and sanctifieth by the washing of water through the word and that of david psal
who saith that the means by which a young man may cleanse his way is by taking heed thereto according to gods word which word of god also he sayes vers
he had hid in his heart that he might not sin against god which inward word of god that is so abundantly spoken of as elsewhere shewed in that
psal that there is not past two of three among those
verses of it in which it is not mentioned as to efficacy excellency usefulness profitableness and power under one name or other of either testimonies statutes judgements precepts law commandements all sounding out one and the same is stiled for it was not an outward writing with mens hands he there means vers

that that scripture joh
is true of words in what it speaks of them and the rest that are suitable to it deny not but that either it or any of them by god or christs words or intend the scriptures without at all much more altogether exclusively as thou talkest of the word spirit and light within and the revelation of minde and will of god thereby immediately in the heart this utterly deny affirming that the internal reveation of his minde to men by his own from his own mouth in their consciences is that which is mainly yea only and altogether intended in them yea and in some not to say all of them exclusively rather of the scriptures as which indeed are not the word or words that are declared to effect those precious things but are only outward writings of spiritually inspired men who witnessed its efficacy in themselves that declare those precious things which the inward word effecteth and the like respectively affirm and deny as concerning that other text jer
of thy own alledging where god saith of his word its a fire and a hammer that breaketh the rocks in peeces denying it utterly to be meant of the writings of the true prophets out of which the false ones stole the words they preacht and then ran and said thus saith

the god of glory thundereth the voice of the lord is powerful full of majesty breaketh the cedars divides the flames shakes the wilderness makes the calve discovers the forrests and that its of this and not the letter which men steal nad call the word is evident by the verses about it where the lord declares himself to be against the prophets that steal and tell and sell what they read in the true prophets writings which they wrest according to their own dreaming thoughts into sinister senses and to tell lies and dreams and divinations of their own brain for truth which stoln ware though they vent the same word which they read in others writings not receiving and uttering as from gods own mouth god calls but the vision of their own mouth and the chaff which is nothing to the wheat and not the other vers

as to that of paul to timothy take heed to thy self and to the doctrine continue in them in so doing thou shalt save thy self and them that hear thee

and more out of the conths from which thou powerest out thy blinde opinion of the bible and concerning the scripture thereof in this particular in such wise saying it is absolutely called the power of god vis virtus dei the power of god the gospel the power of god and faith which is built on that word without other helps or advantages is said to stand in the power of god the word that comes not as a naked word but in power and in the holy ghost and undefined span alphabet giving all manner of assurance and full perswasion of it self even by its power and efficacy it is termed the rod of power or strength denoting its authority and efficacy that which is thus the power and authority of god able to make it self known so to be it is not only said to be undefined span alphabet power the power of god in it self but also undefined span alphabet able and powerful in respect of us undefined span alphabet the sacred letters undefined span alphabet which are able to make wise to salvation they are powerful and effectual to that purpose it is undefined span alphabet potens servare nostras the word that hath power in it to save the able powerful word that paul commends the ephesians undefined span alphabet it is living and effectual by of this power it brought forth fruit in all the world without sword without for the most part miracles without humane wisdome or oratory without any inducements or motives but what were meerly and solely taken from it self in things that eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor could enter into the heart of man to conceive hath this power and efficacy so the conquest of the world causing men of all sorts in all times and places so to fall down before its divine authority as immediately to renounce all that was dear to them in the world and to undergo what ever was dreadful terrible and destructive to nature in all its dearest concernments and such like

reply
all this know to be true of the word light and of god in the hearts of men which the letter points to and the apostles preached as that which men should beleeve in it is absolutely the gospel the power of god to salvation but the letter not so the faith that is built on that word without other helps or advantages from the letter stands in the power of god as abraham noahs enoch abels and all the holy men did that lived by faith in the word twas gods power mighty and effectual to save them before any outward letter was written and without the help and advantage thereof but the outward letter is profitable to nothing at all without the help and advantage of the light and spirit within but is a dead letter of no efficacy for the good of souls and this the same j.o who sayes the scripture without other helps and advantages is so absolute and perfect that

we may obtain eternal life that there's no need of any other revelation by the spirit or light within but those are all dangerous uncertain unprofitable in no wise necessary fanatick figment desestable ex
to the wonted contradiction of himself in all and what is underhand confesses with us in totidem verbis of that scripture which he calls the word
saying that without the of the spirit accompanying mens possession of it it is a dead letter of no efficacy to the good of souls

the word light and spirit of god and christ within nigh in the heart but not the letter without is the gospel which paul bare testimony to and was sent to turn men to by his ministry and was not ashamed of saying its the power of god to salvation to every on that beleeves in it and comes in the outward ministry of it by word of mouth and writing and is witnessed so to do at this day as of old it did to many not in word only but power and the holy spirit giving all manner of assurance and full perswasion of it self to such as through prejudice put it not away from them and thereby judge themselves unworthy of that eternal life which it is the word of that it is not the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god that is both light and living and spirit and life it self even the light of the glorious gospel of christ the image of god which is not letter cor
thining unto them both in and also out of the darkness that is mens hearts where the god of this world blindes not the minds so that men will not beleeve it to the giving them the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of christ

this and not the letter is the rod of power which god to send out of sion even the rod and sharp sword of his and breath of his lips wherewith he will now smite the nations and slay the wicked and reprove with equity on the behalf of the meek of the earth whom the proud oppress even the word of his mouth which he will put into the mouths of his sucklings and their seed and seeds seed out of which he ordains strength to the perfecting his own praise against the persecutor
this and not the weak dead letter bible or scripture thou so labourest bablest and scriblest for is that power and authority of god able as the outward writing is not to make it self known so to be for the letter is as lifeless helpless powerless as any other book writing or dumb idols that men adore and receive ye with the iews of whom thou speak'st
do the bible at this day with the honour and veneration due to god that cannot stir from the place where its set as neither can the scripture from where its laid no more than the turkish alcoran as jeremiah in his epistle of the weakness and vanity of all the idols of the heathen whom they make powerful gods of gods quoth he cannot save themselves from rust and moths though they be covered with purple they wipe them because of the dust of the temple when there is much upon them men put the scepter in their hands as if they were the iudge of the country and daggers and axes but they cannot deliver themselves from theeves nor of themselves put to death one that offends them as a useless vessel worth nothing when broken so it is with their gods they are as the beams of their temples upon their bodies and heads swallows birds and cats they are things in which is no breath yet they set and sell and buy them at a high price they are carried having no feet walk with if they fall to the ground they cannot rise up again of themselves the same together with what follows caeteris

moreover as to the light of god and word nigh in the heart which the apostles preached to turn men to and taught them as the scripture also doth in its testimony there to to attend to as the rule of faith and life this is that word of the truth of the gospel which is is virtus dei the power of god by the vertue of which power it brought forth fruit in the collossians and in all the world where it so came when it came unto them in the ministry thereof which was the means by which they heard of it first and then came themselves to hear it· and to know the grace of god in truth even that grace that bringeth the salvation and appeareth to all men effectu+ally instructing as well without as with the outward letter of it all that at it to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts and to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world which is the light of god in the conscience called the goodness of god or grace given to lead them to repentance who despising the riches of it are not led by it to repent and so treasure up wrath to themselves tit

this is it which brought forth fruit in the world without sword miracles humane wisdome oratory or any inducements or motives but what are meerly and solely taken from it self consisting in things which eye hath not seen ear heard nor the heart of the animal natural man or of any but the spiritual man that by the spirit which only searcheth and revealeth them discerneth the deep things of god can discern or conceive

what power hath it put forth to conquer the world into such submission to the truth as it is in iesus as christ requires or as the letter it self either calls for what fruits of righteousnesse hath it brought forth in the world cal'd christian to the glory of god for all its being conceived in thy brain to be the power of god both in it self and in respect of you look upon all litteral that run a whoring from god the lord the spirit and the light that shines in them there shewing moral good and evil and spiritual good and spiritual wickedness also for the fruites of the spirit and works of the flesh and the lusts thereof envy hatred lasciviousness are manifest and what ever manifests them and all things in the conscience is the light within which is the armour against the one and the enabler to the other and not the letter wihout which only sayes so of the light and see what works most abound in the most reformed nations and churches of it that are turned aside from the truth it self to a meer talking of the text that talks of it are they not the same that are to be found among papists that live by no other professed rule but tradition and popish putasion yea set aside that grosser sort of superstition and thicker cloud of superfluous ceremonies in matter of outward observations in religion in which the kingdome of god which stands in inward righteousns of the heart expressing it self outwardly in the life comes not as to moralities mercy iudgement equity honesty innocency love purity humility faith and fear of god unfained which are the end of carnal commandements contained in ordinances and bodily exercises that else are profitable to little which said moralities as little as thou makest of moral obedience moral good is that which the light in all mens hearts may avail to lead them to

do the things contained in the law and shewed them in the light within them by which they are a law to themselves and go accused or excused in their own conscences before god judge as well thee who by the letter and baptism transgressest it as the iews who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law and rebel against the light is not as much of the true righteousness found among many heathens as among most litteral christians who ever name the name of christ but never depart from iniquity

what geat efficacy and power then hath the letter alone of it self without any other helps advantages or any other revelation by the spirit and light within put forth and exerted to the conquering of the world and the bringing forth of fruit in all the world when as it is evident that it never yet subjected any one whether minister or professor of it to the perfect obedence of it self in the main matters of it as the light and spirit hath done done the children of it as for our parochial and academical livers by the letter temporally mean for otherwise they live neither by the letter nor the light but beside both both they and their beleevers are far from answering the call of their very literal rule which is all they own under that name and notion that they are not come by it into the faith that ever they shall conform to it or be perfected in holiness or cleansed from sin by it either in this world or that to come for whereas much of it is written in way of warning not to sin ioh

j.o god the author of the scripture being the most perfect agent must necessarily act for some end therefore in the of his in the scripture tis sure he had some propounded end but the end is
and
next and immediate we state the ultimate supream and general end to be his own glory the immediate or next end of his giving the and so of the scriptures themselves we to be our direction in the knowledge of god and obedience to be yeelded to him that at length we doing his will may obtain eternal salvation and the enjoyment of himself for this is the end of the worker and of the work
what god intends by the scriptures that they to morally and in the way of operation proper to them effect
but when the perfection of every discipline consists in relation to its end and that is to be held perfect is sufficent to its next end but that imperfect which cannot obtain it end the perfection of the scriptures can consist in no other thing then in its sufficiency in respect to its proper end which is the instruction of men in the knowledge and worship of god that they may attain eternal salvation
in this sense therefore we assert the scripture to be the most perfect rule of the whole worship of god and obedience

whether ere be not a more perfect way of our in the saving knowledge of god then the scripture appears elsewhere where shew no saving knowledge of god comes any way but the inward revelation of himself in us by his light and spirit
here only and confutation of himself in this above by that which follows when the quae say the scripture is perfect to its own proper end and its end being obtained it ceases then quoth he

its most false that the scripture obtains it whole end in respect of us while we are in the world therefore till heaven and earth pass away not one or tittle of the law i.e letter with him shall fail for not only the begetting of faith but also the building up in it while we live here is the end of the scripture so then its end which is begetting to and building up in the faith is not effected by it here is it then in the world to comes no neither quoth he in the section the use of the scripture sh cease then being accomodated only to our present state and faith also as founded on it ll be done
ex


here then is the round i.o makes with a in the middle of it viz
the perfection of the scripture which we plead and affirm and of every thing else is its sufficiency and efficacy to accomplish its own proper immediate end and what ever doth not so is imperfect the immediate end of the scripture is its direction instruction of men in the saving knowledge of god his will worship their obedience and duty to him the ingeneration of faith and edification up in it to salvation this whole end of the scripture its most false to affirm that it accomplishes till the world to come it must do it in this world or in the world to come in this world it cannot possibly do it for perfection in the faith in holiness freedom from sin here is not attainable in the world to come it cannot possibly for there both the scripture it self and also the faith it that is founded on it will cease to be of any use at all being of use only here shall be both done away

is the scripture then the power of god to salvation able mighty effectual available to its end that is to save the soul as i.o sayes it is no quoth i.o it is not its most false to say it doth or can avail to its end in this world in the world to come its of no force so if it be the power of god as i.o affirms it over and over again it is it must be in some world that is past away or some new found world or other for he himself sayes its neither in this present world nor that to come neither now nor hereafter neither here nor there but alas as the world it self wherein he fancies such a thing to be is none knows where but a meer chimaera of his own coining hatcht no where but in his own head the shop where and whence many more such like toyes are shapen sold and uttered among such as having sold the truth are willing rather to trade in utter untruths then in nothing at all and not receiving the love of the truth that they might be saved but taking pleasure in unrighteousness more then it are given over to strong delusion to beleeve lyes that they may be damned
for seriously that the letter or scripture is the power of god to salvation or that word of god which brings forth any good fruit to perfection among either the seedsmen the ministers of the letter that sow nothing but their own senses and thoughts upon it or in the stony thorny common ground of parish peoples hearts in which they sow the letter mingled with their own chaffy cogitations saying hear the word of the lord when yet they confess themselves neve heard his voice
this however ye imagine oh ye power less profitless prophets is a meer no such matter for that is the word or seed that is sown by the supreme sowes the son of man himself in the same field or world of mens hearts in which the world is where the devil in the dark night while men sleep and watch not to the light sows tares among the good seed which where it lights on honest hearts that hear and heed the word patiently continuing in the keeping of it brings forth abundantly

in some thirty some sixty some hundred fold

indeed the letter the text or scripture declares and bears witness to the word which is absolutely necessary effectual perfect to the ends aforesaid which is the power of god the light of god the wisdome saving truth immediate witness clearest way of revelation law sure foundation most perfect rule immoveable stedfast standard of gods setting up but it self is nos all nor any of this nor doth it at all any where avouch it self to be any of it at all
the scripture points to that which is the power of god by the being of which in and upon his people who only own and joyn to it they are made a willing people in the day thereof when such as turn from and against the light which is the power and labour in the weak naked letter labour in vain and are left unwilling to leave their lusts and lives for christ as his maryrs or outward witnesses did in all ages but the letter it self is not power of god that sustained them in the suffering and inabled them to forgo what was dear to them and to undergo what was dreadful and destructive to nature in its dearest concernments
the letter tells us that the saints did so and tells us and all saints that we should do for christ but the power by which this is done is another matter then a letter ad extra even the inward light word and spirit that thou doest despite to even that in the conscience that made them indure as seeing him who is invisible and discovered the darkss upon the discovery of which they rather chose death then to own it as light and truth not only in ages as high as moses who by faith in the light chose affliction rather then sin and feared not the wrath of pharaoh but also from him downward as low as maries dayes in which some died for denying the of the popes of transubstantiation which the light in their consciences told them were too gross to be of god who yet by their confession could not dispute against it with vniversity sottish sophisters doctor dunces out of letter nor so much as read a letter therein and also as low as these dayes wherein by the power of god many are born up to bear the trials of the cruel academical mockings scoffings scourgings stonings bonds imprisonments abuses to death witness one of the first of the lords two that were sent to warn the vniversity of their universal at oxford in the time of i.os vice chancellorship there· who perhaps may not be so learned literally though mystically and spiritually more in the letter as obtuse a~cuti many of those nimble disputers out of it are in their bald fashion of syllogistical form

neither did the letter either of the old testament which is the letter without of what things soever written or the outward letter of the new ever conquer the world in which thou sayest it brought forth so much fruit further then into a meer empty fruitless form of godliness without the power thereof insomuch that though as to the primitive christian churches while they kept in the light which the apostles ministry whether by word of mouth or writing letter scripture was to turn them to walk by and beleeve in

and in the spirit in which they began till being bewitched from obeying the truth it self they turned aside to the outward text that tells it and so thought to be made perfect by the flesh and the fleshly bodily exercises they found in the letter which once used were as low weak

elements for a time the power of god and godliness was much among them and abode with and upon them to the prevailing against the powers of the earth and the overcomming the world it self and satan the prince of it by the blood of the lamb and the word of his testimony not loving their lives to the death and much fruit of the spirit and of righteousness was brought forth to the glory and praise of god

but when synods and councels doting doctors infatuated and such as admired their persons as they the persons of the apostles and primitive disciples began to bundle together what they could get of the of such as were coaetaneous with christ and the apostles and without any such order from either christ or the apostles to canonize what in their conceits might be useful to others as they had found them tis like to be to themselves into a rule or canon and stated them into a common standard for all to have their sole recourse to in
and matters of christian faith and holy life and so to adore the dead letters of those holy living men and to run a whoring after some remnants of writings that dropt from them then in the whole world now called christendome instead of an apostolical spouse of christ as christians were at first presented a chaste virgin to himself by them there stands up an apostatical strumpet that had the letter and good words written there but neither the life of god nor the word of

life therein testified to that according to the nature of error which is ever multiplying degenerated more and more into the dark till at last being gone from the word spirit light and life within to the outward letter that relates of it they ran into the wildernes of their own numberless senses upon it so that they lost the letter also and fell from it into tradition and a thousand old wives fables and though it is good and acknowledged so to be so far as it is that the protestants have marched from rome under the conduct of the yet for all they are come back from the blinde screel scrawls of the popish scribes for their smoaky imaginations to a pretensive profession of and prate scripturis for the scriptures unless they march on according to the conduct of the scriptures till they come into the light and spirit which they point to and by a dotage upon the scriptures ye would run from they are not so much as come yet to the scriptures nor to conform to that counsel of the prophets and apostles given in it but are yet erring from the scriptures even in and by their very eager scriblings for it as the only most perfect rule and from the only rule of faith and way to life the letter is as loud for but that they are dull of hearing as they in their naked writings are loud for the naked letter it self

and so it comes to pass that as israel was of old who was as laborious in the letter busie about the bible and strict for his as our israel

for the which yet they confess too is abolished as to the litteral observation of it with the appendix of a few of stories and letters and revelations of those holy men next to christs time who by the spirit wrote much more then is there own'd as their standard say as the old israel proved as to god an empty vine hos bringing forth fruit only to himself so is our national gospel israel an empty vine fruitful to themselves in temporals and in gerere in such spiritual also as their religion lyes in viz in empty forms of fastings prayings preachings singings of davids psalms with doegs spirit

christ speaks of the same and not of any outward scripture for by that word their word is intended the word which they preached or held forth or testified to by their words in their preachings and writings as that which men were to come to hear and beleeve in and do till beleeving in which though they or do beleeve historically the outward declaration as the papists do the litteral declaration at this day with their heart and confess it with their mouths that the lord iesus was raised the dead yet they perish and beleeve not on the name of god savingly or to salvation which word is not the letter nor their preachings but that which the letter and their oral preachings testified to that it was nigh men in their hearts and mouths that they might hear and do it even the word of faith which they preached

now as to i.o though often he puts a difference between the writing and the doctrine and sayes the scriptura formaliter or litera scripta is one thing and the materia or veritas scripta is another yet rather then he will give the question to the qua who care not whether he doth or no which question as is shewed above he is not ashamed basely to beg he will distemper and conjumble all that together again into one chaos or lump of confusion which he had once orderly set asunder and therefore drives on in gross without dividing between the scripture writing letter or text and the word doctrine light or truth thats written of and earnestly endeavouring to blend all these into one

it is the writing quoth he it self it now supplies the roome and place of the persons in and by whom god originally spake to men as were the persons speaking of old so are the writings now it was the word that was to be beleeved yet as spoken by them from god and its now the word written that is to bee beleeved yet as written by the command and appointment of god
rep all this grant to be very true but tending to the overturning of j.os own cause and purpose in it which is to prove the scripture or writing to be the word of god and to the confirming of the qua cause who against him deny that assertion for the word spoken and written even as spoken and written by gods appointment is that which we say is still within the hearts of men though witnessed to without in the ministry of prophets and apostles preaching and writing of it as that in which they were to beleeve in which beleeving according to the voyces and scriptures of holy men calling them thereto and beleeved by them they thenceforth and not before were said to beleeve on the name of god through which beleeving in it they had life but whats this to evince the writing to be that word spoken thus written of which was another thing which was as truly in to life before it was written of as after oh quoth j.o as were the persons speaking of old so are the writings now
true whence in his own words argue back ad hominem on him thus as were the persons speaking the word of god old so are the writings now
not the persons preaching no nor yet their preachings and speakings were the wo of god they preached and spake of but only means by which men were brought to beleeve in the word of god whats paul whats apollos but ministers by whom ye beleeved cor
therefore the writings now are not the word of god written of but only an outward means by which men are brought to beleeve in another thing then the for life even in the word of faith nigh in their own hearts which the prophets and apostles preached and wrote of that order to life men should beleeve in it

reciting the words of it which are these the word of god is quick and powerful or as thou there undefined span alphabet living and effectual sharper than any piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the

rep cannot but stand almost astonished at thy stupidity in expounding that text of scripture of the text of scripture and of that terme there the word of god of the book called the bible which the business of thy book is mostly about sith the efficacy and power of the word here spoken of is far beyond that of the letter or scripture it self the inefficacy and weakness of which have shewed above specially abstract from the spirit and light within in which way thou asserts the sufficiency of it witness thy own words above rehearsed as to any such mighty matters as are here mentioned
is the letter the scripture sharper then any sword to divide soul and spirit a diver into a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart what thinkest thou by the sharp sword that goes out of his mouth that rides the white horse with his vesture dipt in blood and the armies in heaven following not in lawn sleeves sarcenet scarffs sattanical canonical coats scarlet formalities white surplices velvet plush black gippoes and such like scholastick superfluities but in fine linnen white and clean i.e

which was in the beginning before letter was and was with god and was god for the three that bear witness in heaven the father word and are one and all three spirit and light and the letter is none of them all and these without the letter are effectual and so before it though t.d sayes the spirit was not wont to be effectual without the letter
of his
pamph but the letter and its revelation is not sufficient and omnibus numeris absolute as j.o darkly divines to effect and perfect all things as to gods glory and our salvation of it self so that theres no need at all of any other witness or revelation by the spirit and light within

t.d indeed if any save such as are bewitcht and befooled already would be such fools as to follow his foolish fancy would and what parish preachers do not the like make men beleeve by his blinde wayes of proving it as if it were so at and that is a little more moderate then i.os boundless elevation of the letter which hee makes little less than all in all that the spirit was not wont to be effectual without the letter in proof of which his false assertion urges rom
the same text that i.o wrests the same way faith which is the spirits work quoth he in the forenamed page comes by hearing hearing by the word of god which terme the word of god there
t.d and i.o and their adjutants generally take to be the scripture text though if any measure of right reason did rule in them they might see in the same chapter that the word of faith by which it comes is that they preached to be brought nigh in mens hearts and by god himself that there they might both hear and do it deut

but so far is his position from having any truth in it as much as he stands up r.h who justly withstands him in it that if his own eyes were but half open he could not but see the flat falsehood of it yea it is so palpable that before all the world will here lay down the very contrary as the truth viz· the spirit was wont to be effectual without the letter and why he should lose any of his authority power and efficacy by mens writings as they were moved by him he is either wiser then that can tell or else very fond in asserting what he can tell no reason for and that the spirit or sword of the spirit which is the word of god whether we understand it of christ himself that spirit cor

so say in this ad solem caecuti necesse est he must be so blinde as not to see the sun when it shines upon him that is ignorant of it or assents not to it since as r.h told him then it was so so tell him here over again in r.h his words with the addition of the long tract of time wherein twas wont to be so the sword of the spirit is the word of god which was effectual two thousand years before the letter was

and this the rather assert against t.d here in this place because he is so ignorant as to tax r.h there for usual speaking and for as well or better then good sense in that when t.d said the spirit was not wont to be effectual without the letter
repeats him saying thus the sword of the spirit is ineffectual without the letter which in effect is all one if t.ds eyes were well open to see clearly what the spirit is and what the letter and then replies thus the sword of the spirit is the word of god which was effectual before the letter was

now demand of thee t.d
where is any r.h spake whose words here speak after him that may clear them from thy unjust cenre of and if r.h understood any as thou sayest he did then that must import that thy self with whom he was then in discourse hadst spoken some for he could not understand that from thee which thou never speakest out of thy own mouth then at least thou art condemned for speaking some if a man were minded to prosecute thee for it for habemus ret conficentem we have it from thy self if it were so but though thou tacitly taxest thy self with yet shall do thee that right this once as to clear and exuse thee from thy own false for in truth both what thou spakest and what r.h spake was all good sense as to the intelligibleness of the phrases unless thou account every sentence to be that is false as to the matter propounded in it as in a sense thou mayest there being no sense nor reason for it that any man should affirm and tell an untruth and then confess thou spakest nonsense and r.h good sense sith his saying was true and thine was false
for the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and the spirit it self and not the letter as thou who art somewhat low and implicite not very loud me thinks nor express as if thou durst not for shame speak out

thy minde about it seemest to make it was wont to be effectual without and was effectual before the letter was

but heres indeed the very knot of the business thou deemest r.h to utter in not being so as with t.d i.o and their chronies to interpret the sword of the spirit there called the word of god of the outward letter or scripture that is the thing will not down with t.d without straining at it as a peece of to assert the sword of the spirit not to be the letter witness t.ds words of r·h t.d
as for what he says that the sword of the spirit is the word of god if he meant like a man in his oppositions he must mean christ who but once is called the word of god rev

rep
in this parcel is more truth granted to the qua then t.d himself understands so to be or will ever stand under the force of when made use of by them against himself for he sayes the spirit is christs sword by which according to
act

he works operates in men mark his words and is said to strive with them that alwayes resist him even in themselves

could never yet get it granted from t.d or any other contenders against the truth in this point that christ had a spirit of his in men by the operations of which he is said in those two texts to strive with them themselves for howbeit its the common doctrine laid down positively by themselves unawares many times yet when they meet with qua in verbal discourses who urge these two self same texts and that in pet

but in the parcel above we have it under t.ds own hand what need we say more or use more witness nnless the false witnesses agreed better together then they do within themselves and with each other for vve can either turn each of them to himself or one of them over to another vvellnigh at any time for an ansvver that the spirit is christs sword and by it hee works in the hearts of men i.e all men in proof of vvhich gen

sith he is not the spirits sword but the spirit his and so thinks he hath it that since tis not christ himself it must be the letter that is there called the sword of the spirit and the word of god as if there vvere no third to be assigned as in opposition to the letter for this is his argument in form viz the sword of the spirit is either christ or the letter not any third but tis not christ therefore it must be the letter

reply
what if tell him by the sword of the spirit there called the word of god one may mean a third as paul doth in that place that is neither christ himself whose sword his spirit is nor yet the letter which undoubtedly is not it and yet mean like a man too yea verily be means not like a spiritual man but smells lik a minister of the letter and not of the spirit that means it of the letter and not of the spirit it self for spirit it is as the letter is not and the word of god whether understood of the lord himself that spirit cor
which is called the word of god rev
or of the spirit of the lord cor
which is also the word of the lord and sword that goes out of christs mouth called elsewhere the rod of his power the rod of his mouth the breath of his lips the spirit and life joh

as blinde as ye are neither to behold nor beleeve it

and that the sword of the spirit is not the scripture or letter is evident for it is something even a word and sword that was before the letter which only relates of it and therefore the letter is not it unless a man will be so unmanly as to say the scripture or letter was before the letter was which were nonsense with a witness

again if the letter be the sword of the spirit and word of god then there was two thousand years wherein was none of the sword of the spirit or vvord of god that paul there speaks of and a long time together wherein christ and the spirit had no sword which is most gross absurd and sottish to assert yet is not t.d alone found in it but i.o also in the same for these two are seldome otherwise if not contradicting then concurring with each other in the same folly who
sayes thus of the text unless he intend it of the truth it self the spirit of truth joh
and gods word is truth abstract from the text which only tells of it which spirit and which vvord of truth was before the text and is where his text is not and then acquit him though by the word of truth he usually intends the text and scriptures of it as the stands now pointed and asserted neither jews nor socinians shall be able to relieve themselves from the sword of truth therein if by therein hee means the truth declared only own it the sword for the vvord which is spirit is a sword but if the text or scripture that is no other then the scabbard
besides the letter the bible ye bawl for is too blunt a business to cut so close and search so the quick into the secrets of the heart thoughts soul spirit of men as the sword we are yet talking about doth and too blinde a business to be denominated as the vvord of god spoken of eph

he tells how god by that hath placed a thing called in us in reference to his own over us and reveals himselfes the sons of men and much to the like tune and sayes it is by the light in the scriptures which is say that which the scripture testifies of that tis in the heart by which the scripture dives into the and there determines judges in the majesty and authority of god yet the crown still is stated on the head of the scripture by him and that light it came from in holy men which is the same a small measure of which is in all mens hearts and consciences whose external subordinate instrument sometimes the letter is is made by him but the subordinate instrument of the letter by which quoth he the letter and doth this and that and effects and perfects all which yet to go round again contradicts his own excludings in the other places of his book of the spirit and light within from bring needful or any way concurrent with the letter but rather as fiicious and detestable

so letter is the supream judge only most perfect rule and ruler of all and transacter of all still as to mans salvation with i.o who little heeds how the revelation made by the light in the conscience is of an unexpresiably larger extent then the manifestation of things is that is made by the letter that came from it for the naked letter or the light by it only manifests the right of matters what is to be done what not what is good what evill the moral law shews the moral good that is to be acted the moral evil that is to be declined or else no life but cursing but the naked without the letter that was within mens hearts as it now is before the letter was not as the letter doth de jure the moral good and evil as i.o himself confesses and moral or evangelical obedience and righteousness that is the substance of that legal and ceremonies that stood in typical transactions and a time but also over and above searches the heart and shews to every man de facto what is and is not done of the will of god de jure revealed and accordingly accuseth or excuseth justifieth or condemmeth in the majesty and authority of god so that its particular sentencing of every man either to life or death blessing or cursing acceptation or stands ratified inalterably in the court of heaven yea hereby christ shews every one as hee did the woman of samaria all that ever she did and what they do and are think or speak and answerably either acquits or accuses as ioh
as our hearts condemn us or not by that of god in them so are we justified or condemned have boldness or bashness before the tribunal of heaven for whose sins the light remits are remitted and whose sms is retaines are retained and the ministers of the light do by it judge the world that lyes in wickedness and justifie the righteous and we know their judgement is true and their sentence sure and shall stand in fore as it doth in

but the letter is too too weak an engine to enter here and too short a sword to divide so distinctly within as the spirit and law of the spirit of life doth which is the light the sword of the spirit the word of god
which titles say still against t.d and i.o also are not to be all attributed much less as they are by them often appropriated to the letter of the scripture but are to be denominated only of christ or his spirit either of which a man may mean as in opposition to the letter t.ds conceits to the contrary notwithstanding and yet mean like a man and a minister also for as christ whose name is the word of god is that spirit sword of the father who is also a spirit with which he will wound and rule the wicked unruly nations to the spirit of both the father and the son or word which is one spirit with them for these three are one joh

and both are the armour of god of righteousness of light which we are bid and and said to put on rom cor

and because it may seem such to t.d to say the sword of the spirit is the spirit it self and not another outward instrument of a letter which yet we know the spirit can use too when he pleases though his operations are most effectual when he is heeded in his immediate workings within the heart for t.d
wot judges the phrase improper to call the spirit it self the sword of the spirit and that that manner of speech must needs import another thing let me ask thee why so t.d must it needs import another thing then the spirit to say the sword of the spirit why must it be improper so to say hadst thou had thy eyes in thy head and thy wits well about thee when thou busiedst thy self about that text thou wouldest have seen the spirit and paul by it whom thou wilt not dare to charge with speaking though thou chargest r.h for the same speak in the same way of the celestial panoply as ye use to it is not the brestplate of of faith preparation of the gospel of peace faith and the gospel of peace it self in the verses next above and the armor of light the light it self rom why then may not the sword of the spirit be meant of the spirit it self and yet a man mean like a man and not mean as thou wouldest seem to make r.h to do in so meaning and now to i.o again about the text heb

so that there is no need of any other revelation by the spirit and light within but those all are uncertain vain useless detestable
now tis without the spirit a dead letter yea the word is so too with i.o as if the word of god and christ which is spirit and life was sometimes from the spirit take it in his own terms then reader lest thou think wrong him all this while the jews enjoyed the letter of the scripture as they do at this day yea they receive it with the honour and veneration due to god
their possession of it is not accompanied

with the administration of the spirit without which as we see in the instance of themselves

and now as to that text which remains yet with one more to bee touched on viz psal
thy word is a light to my feet and a lamp to my paths which thou also appliest to the letter as the light and lamp there spoken of and upon that account from that and many more as little to thy purpose and as much to ours as that is lettest out thy minde into a long peece of dark prate about the letters being the most glorious light in the world as if it were that in ioh
which is not the letter but the measure of the light come from christ into all mens consciences almost throughout the fourth chapter of thy first treatise

together one of which is but a citation of the other and it may evidently seem from his more concordantial than cordial consultations both here and elsewhere that howbeit he set not all of them down hoc opus esset yet by all places in his concordance where he findes these terms word and light he incontinently concludes the scripture and letter to be meant and so on that account as cloudily cotes as many of them as he judges as to number may make a

viz
the scripture the word of god

is light in proof that the letter is the light against such as deny it for none deny the word of god to be the light that know of but i·o himself who jeers of the verbum insernum lumen internum as figmentum horrendum ex

so that where ever the reader findes him prosecuting the proof of it under that terme of the word saying the word is the light rule foundation and such like he must be taken as intending the scripture letter text witness both title pages proscripturis a vindication of the scriptures against the fanaticks to be the word of god and of the purity and integrity of the hebrew and greek texts though say they are all subscribed in vindication of the letter to be the light yet there is not on them all that subscribes to i.os sentence or judgement on them but they all give their verdict another way even for that which is light and the light indeed as we deny it not viz the word law commandement iudgements of god and christs mouth but not at all for the external text or letter of the scripture which issue forth ad extra from the said word law commandement iudgements that are ad intra a great deep and known savingly to those only that wait on god in the light within

but to come to some examination of his texts and of what testimony they give for him beginning however with the first and ranking the rest as shall see occasion
the scripture is light quoth he those that reject it are called undefined span alphabet lights rebels men the authority that they cannot but bee convinced of

reply
that such as reject the scripture are to be rejected and freely grant if by rejecting thou meanest such a rejection as is in detestation of

them in which wise thou rejectest the spirit and light within and all the revelation made thereby when of those means of coming to the knowledge of god and to salvation thou sayest ex
inania sunt ista principia cognitionis dei inutilia periculosa faniticir simulata ideoque rejicienda ae decestanda those are vain utterly unprofitable perillous wayes toward the knowlege of god and salvation fanatick figments and therefore to be rejected and abhorred and in which wise thou falsely accusest the qua among others as rejecters of the scriptures when thou them ex

undefined span alphabet haters of the scriptures as if they bore some spleen or such spite to the letter as ye do to the light and spirit or more than to other writings which yet we for holy truth and doctrines sake declared in them love and prize above any books and honour one chapter of them as more worth than twenty of your printed preachments upon them say he that so rejects the letter or scripture as is above said let him be rejected and even anathema maranatha for me for otherwise there is a kinde of rejecting which the light is not liable to of the meer letter or scripture that is not at all to be found fault with much less to be rejected and detested as that of those who make waste paper of old printed sheets or leaves of the bibles and use them as they do other scriptures or writings as they please about refusely occasions

but the qua are not to be ranked among such ranke rejecters of it as the first

that such as spitefully reject the scriptures are though they are not so called in that of iob rebellious against the light also may well bee owned howbeit upon this account only as the letter truly transcribed that came from the light and the light it came from are though two things yet so agreeing together in one as to the same testimony they both bear to the same truth that he cannot really and truly whatever hee may seem to do receive own and obey the one who is found fighting denying rejecting and rebelling against the other whereupon as obedient and reverential respectful even to superstition as i.o would be judged to bee to the letter which he and others receive as the jews do with the honour and veneration due to god yet saving all these shews they are still rebels against the very letter whilst so rebellious against the light as to reject it with that detestation that is due to nothing but sin it self and the very devil for he that owns the letter aright must own come to beleeve in follow the light that shines from christ and shews the good and the evil in his own by the fall darkned heart defiled blinded and benighted conscience sith the letter testistes of and calleth men to this light as he cannot be said to fulfill and live according to the letter that lives besides the light it calls to so cannot he be said not to fulfill or to live beside the letter who lives according to the light it came from

but not upon this account can he bee said to rebel against the light who rejects the letter because the letter and light are one and the thing viz· the letter the light and the light the letter as i.o dreams for howbeit that be his sense yet assuredly neither is the letter the light nor the light the letter but they are two distinct things that are no more synonamous

or one in name then they are in their essential properties and proper natures and that however in some generals they may be one and so omnia quia entia sunt quid unum is in reality not at all

and lastly in what sense soever such as reject the letter may be called lights rebels which is in no wise in respect of the letter and lights being individually the same yet as is said above they are in no wise so called in that of job and if the light had been as much heeded by i.o as the letter is lookt in by him without the light which only leads into the true meaning of it yea if common reason had but ruled him hee would have seen by the word light the letter is not intended for to let pass other considerations that might be as cogent in this case when ever or by whomsoever that history or book of job was written whether in his dayes or after by himself or any other yet that chapter being a part of jobs speech to his friends it must be spoken in his dayes whom jerom on genesis augustine ambrose philo plato and most antient fathers and writers luther on gen
observe to have lived long before moses whom ye judge the first scripturewriter carried israel out of egypt and so consequently before any of your scripture or letter which ye now call the light was written and that job should denominate the wicked of his dayes under the name of undefined span alphabet lights rebels rebellious against the letter long before any letter was written unless his own book which yet if in his days must be written after that was spoken is such a trim peece of teachment and credible conceit as could say more to had to do with another man but to him shall say no more but that which is his usual saying of what is at no hand to be beleeved

ult so shall need to say no more to to those texts in this place nor yet to that psal
which is of the same nature whereby the light and truth that david if it were his psalm desires god to send out could not be intended the letter and text for so much of that as he made use of for his own condition was sent out before which was but little more then the five books of moses perhaps joshua judges ruth and job and tis but folly to fancy that he prayed that more letter might be given out to guide him who had so much of the light and spirit that by it hee wrote much of the letter himself or if he did pray for more letter to guide him then was know no more was granted him unless what psalms hee wrote himself which the spirit mov'd him to write for the good of others for that of samuel the seer is mostly of him and those of nathan and gad were so also
see chron

and if nathan and gad wrote any to bee davids guide they are none nor of yours being not in you bibles and so that light and letter he prayed for is not the letter yee have and talk for nor doth the letter and text lead any to the holy hill of god and his tabernacle but to the light and truth it came from which is it only and not the letter as ye have it that came immediately from god so only leads immedlately unto him

sith they both in the termes relate to the thing and time marvel not a little but that god is now proceeding according to his promise isa to do that marvellous thing even that marvellous work wonder and turning the wisdom of the wise into foolishness and bringing to naught the understanding of the prudent should much more marvel then do to see a professed doctor in divinity residing at the well head of learning and religion dwell so deeply in the darkness and in the region and shadow of death as to interpret the term of light in those two texts of no other thing then the letter of the scripture
the words are these the people meaning the land of zebulun and nepthali by the way of sea beyond iordan which sate in darkness saw great light and to them that dwelt in the region and shadow death light is sprung up
rep
the juncture of time of which this is spoken concerning the land of zebulun and nepthali seeing great light was when christ himself the light of the world came among them dwelling at capernaum a chief city of those two tribes by the and shone ronnd about them in his own immediate ministry

the scriptures or letter which by the word light there is by our great i.o said to be intended must be either those of the old testament as ye speak or of the new those of old could not be meant here for if they had been that light they could not have been said to have sate till now in darkness and shadow of death neither could the light have been said as it is here to have sprung up now so newly to them for the outward scriptures of moses and the prophets was sprung up to that people of israel long before this time and those of the new it could not possibly for john the baptist and christ having written nothing at all that is extant in your bibles though christ after this wrote something that is not there

and the apostles and evangelists having written nothing yet for not one them was called till after this as appears by the verses following not one jot or tittle of that was sprung up to them as yet therefore what ever light it was and what it was is well enough known to the children of the light though not to the children of darkness that despise and wonder and perish not beleeving the work that god is working in their own daye this can tell them which is as much as is meet for them to know till they live up to what they know already and as much as is needful to the case in hand that it was not the letter of the scriptures

and now am so near that mat
it is not amiss to step thither before go back to hosea where the words are ye are the light of the world which place i.o brings to prove the letter to be the light
rep should sooner by the half have urged gen
god said let there be light and there was light to prove the letter to be the light for that hath a typical mystical reference to the true spiritual light that inwardly every man that comes into the world then that clause of christ to his disciples yee are the light of the world for that hath not the least tittle of tendency to such a thing unless i.o who is blinde enough in blending the writing and letter written of into one individium will now grow so gross in his confusions as to confound and thrust a third thing viz the men that wrote some of the scriptures into one and the same individium with them and so make a new kinde of trinity in unity and unity in trinity which if he shall then letting pass that long tale of the doctrine of the trinity in seven or eight pages together viz to

trinitonians their bell not mettle nor the tune of a bell but the tone of a kettle

but i.o hath a saying toucht on above whereby perhaps hee may think this unfavoury sound is salved it is the writing it self quoth hee
that now supplies the place and room of the persons in and by whom god originally spake to men as were the persons speaking of old so are the writings now
rep
therefore say as the outward persons of the men which i.o reckons on were not the word of god so neither were nor are their writhings the word of god ad hominem
ob
but may he say the persons of the are here called the light of the world

rep as vessels that bore the name word truth or light of god to the world by the figure or common metonymy as said above whereby the thing containing is called by the name of that that is contained in it or held forth by it which yet either as to name and thing it really and properly is not can allow i.o his denomination of the apostles by that name of a light in such wise as commonly by the said figure but not properly the in sensu together with the light shining in it is termed the light which lanthorn of it self is so far from being abstractively from the revelation made in it by the light within it

a light of it self that its a dark body that can neither shew any thing else nor bee seen it self without it bee manifested by something else that is truly light

but all this will lend i.o as little help as none at all in his lame cause who hath entred the lists with qua before the world to vindicate the word of god and the light to be the proper name and nature of the letter to evince it against them as to name and thing so to be

its a spirit that quickens even the words he speaks which are spirit life not an outward flesh much less an outward letter but this is a great mystery when we speak of christ and his church that eats his flesh and drinks his blood to cleansing from all sin and to life as the eaters and drinkers of bread and wine yet do not and are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone this is childrens bread a knowledge too wonderful for our accademical scribes and for the life while they hate the light who are so lost in their laudings of the letter and hampered in their heads about their senses of the history and taken up with tattle for every tittle of the text that they have not time to turn in to the light whereby to see it and so miss the mystery of the gospel which is revealed only to them that live and walk therein by the light and spirit in the heart
as to that hos
hee must bee more then that takes the word light there to be intended of the letter since the place sufficiently explains it self in the next clause before that and expresses it to bee the words of gods own mouth the same that have said enough to above even that sword and spirit and rod of his mouth and breath of his lips and brightness of his own coming wherewith he smites the nations consumes the man of sin reproves for the meek and slayes the wicked tis true he sayes in the first clause of the verse hee hews them by his prophets for hee comes not to do any judgements on the wicked which hee reveals not first to his servants the prophets who go forth and warn them of the the doom that from the lord himself is drawing nigh upon them but tis the words of his own mouth the light from himself that condenms them in their own consciences for their evil deeds by which he slayes and executes his wrath and judgement under which they are left inexcusable upon them which judgements are as a light that goeth forth purging away the sin and preparing a way for the lords coming in mercy to such as wait quietly on him in the way of his judgements while they pass as at the house of god they do whereat they begin till her righteousness at last go forth also as brightness isa
and her glory and salvation as a lamp that burneth

as to that ioh
one would not think it that had not seen the lord hiding the plain truth of the gospel as it lyes open in the text from the wise and prudent which hee is revealing unto babes that one of the renowned scribes and disputers of this world should be so confounded as to conceive that by light there is meant the letter since tis as clear as the light it self from the verses themselves and those that go immediately before them that that light alone which the letter only points to and not the letter it self can so much as possibly be there intended

where's th scribe where's the disputer of this world for the scriptures that he cannot see the scriptures themselves he is so scraping for is hee not a miserably leader that would lead men to the letter in its testimony to the light which letter hath no higher end then to bring men to beleeve in that true light of the world which it self doth but testifie of which light is no other then that which shines immediately whether the glass of the letter be beheld yea or nay from himself who is the sun of righteousness into the world that is in mens hearts condemning the and his deeds laying open to them not de jure only what the lusts of it are and in the undefined span alphabet that they are to bee avoided even those of the eye flesh pride but de facto how far forth they are or are not avoided and accordingly censuring them within themselves where the letter cannot come in the inmost cells of the consciences of such men of the world as live where the letter without was never so much as outwardly seen or heard of is not hee of whom and whose light all that spoken vers
recorded by the same evangelist joh
saying am come a light into the world that whoever beleeveth in me may not abide in darkness and ioh
hee that followeth me ark me the true light joh
that enlighten every man that cometh in the world shall not walk in darkness but have the light of life is all this and much more in that book joh
and much more throughout the epistles of the same holy man who speaks of the word that was in and was the light from the beginning before any letter was and of the son of god and the holy unction intended and to be interpreted of no other then the little letter and of no more then that little of the letter that was written by motion of that spirit which is bound up and bounded within the brief bounds of your now bibles

pellibus exiguis arctatur fili usingens pellibus exiguis arctatur spirit usingens

thou that art named mic
the house of jacob is the spirit of the lord so straitned are these his doings do not his words which are heard from his own mouth do good to him that walketh uprightly by them now as well as in former dayes

moreover the letter is not come into all the world so universally de facto actualiter for de jure potentialiter it may by right and possibly enough be so transmitted but that were too much cost for our covetous clergy to bestow bibles without coin upon poor heathenish nations into all the dark corners of the earth as the light spoken of ioh
must necessarily bee supposed to do or else it is not adequate to the case there handled for the letter

is actually seen and read but in a small part of the world but the world into all which the word that is the true light is said to come both in col
joh
and in joh
which is parallel to them is the whole world that lyes in wickedness and every man in it dwells in darkness and shadow of death yea where ever the spiritual darkness is and that is in all mens hearts where the letter comes not among such as carry it under their arms there is this true light said to shine though the darkness doth not comprehend it joh

know the narrow pinching conceits of such as would winde the wide world here spoken of within the short circuit of his church or the elect which they confess though as personally predestinated to life as all the rest are peremptorily to damnation without any respect to foreknown faith or unbeleef to be scarce one of a thousand telling us a world of men in the moon of their own fancies and making the letter which they call the word the foundation of that world which god hath set up in this world so i.o doth
as undefined span alphabet a wheel within a wheel his church and asserting the term world ioh to denote the elect a few in it only as t.d at the second dayes disptute at sandwich to which he had his answer much what to the as follows that if by the world the church or elect only is meant then those six verses viz
must be read and rendred thus viz
for god so loved the world of the elect that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever in all that world of the elect beleeveth in him might not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world of the elect to condemn the world of the elect but that the world of the elect through him might be saved he in this world of the elect that beleeveth on him is not condemned but he in this world of the elect that beleeveth not is condemned already because he hath not beleeved on the only begotten son of god as if some of the elect did beleeve and yet others of their very peremptorily elected ones both to faith and life might not beleeve and so be condemned and perish and this is the condemnation of those elected ones that perish that light is come into the world of the elect but men elect men love the darkness more then the light because their deeds are evill
for every elect one that doth evill hateth the light neither cometh to the light left his deeds should bee reproved but hee among the elect that doth truth commeth to the light that his deeds may bee manifested to bee wrought in god

much more was replied to t.ds dream then then shall bee repeated in this page because am here in talk with i.o to another purpose about the letter which is not a little served by the inserting of so much of it here as occasion is the universality of this true light i.o owns to bee the letter may be transiently touched upon again before the end only thus say here to that absurdity of t.d who is not alone in it it being the doctrine of most of our modern protestant divines the odness of which which need not bid any one that is well in his wits to behold shall leave to all men among whom if any will bee ignorant let him be ignorant if any be honest he will see it in due time that the word world which is sometimes used to express the whole fabrick of the vniverse
and sometimes when

predicated of persons all men good and bad as here ioh
and sometimes for the major part of men which are the worst lying in wickedness and wondring after the beast or at best in but a form of christianity ioh
rev
and sometimes for the whole race of the wicked abstract from the righteous seed which are the fewest ioh
yet here summon all men in the world to shew so much as one text wherin is used to express a minor part of men unless by an hyperbole as behold the world is gone out after him or one at all wherein its used to express the saints church or elect in a sense abstract from or exclusively of the wicked and shall yeeld they have shewed me more then ever could yet finde at least though twill be little to disprove the universality of christs light in all men
till then that that is done not triingly nor seemingly for a shew but solidly seriously conscientiously cogently irresistibly and substantially must be excused if their mundus electorum ex mundo electus as they speak which is one of the many round os that i.o and t.d dance together in among other divines in their divinity doctrines do pass for me under that most proper name that i.o himself gives it of a wheel in a wheel indeed

but lastly that the universality and large extent of the light ioh
said by i.o to be the letter is such as the letter is not adequate unto and therefore cannot be meant by it let the two verses answer it themselves and let the first of them speak first on behalf of both
every one that doth evill hatetht he light neither cometh to the light left his deeds should bee reproved but he that doth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be manifested that they are wrought in god

rep
this light whatever it is is hated avoided shunned by every one that doth evil therefore it cannot be the letter of the scripture in various respects because abstract from the doctrine teaching and light of christ which is in the heart and conscience the letter neither hated nor shunned nor feared by the evil doer nor need be for fear his deeds should be reproved by it for though de jure the light by the letter sometimes and sometimes without it manifest evill deeds for the works of the flesh as well as the fruits of the spirit are manifested the letter saith and that all that is reproved is manifested by the light not the letter it self and what ever doth make manifest is the light gal

eph
yet that by which de facto his deeds i.e every mans own deeds are reproved if evill and manifested so himself to be good is the light in his conscience without the letter which as well without the letter as with it shews moral good and evill and without the letter ever shews every mans own deeds de facto to himself and that from god as i.o confesses a man needs no witness without him to assure him that what his conscience speaks it speaks from god
if he be in deceit it will tell him yea in short by this light there christ shews as he did the woman of samaria all that ever they did which thing the light as shining without in the letter only doth not much less the letter without it for that tells only what men should have done not what de facto they have done within themselves so that evill ones need not much more fear coming to that alone then a thief in the night need fear being discovered by a dark lanthorn that hangs up without a candle in it for the letter alone is but as the lanthorn and tis as evident that thousands of evill doers who hate the light and dare not come to it

are not nor afraid of comming near the letter they couzen cheat are bloody cruel proud and wicked steal lye swear commit adultery yet read hear love to look in the letter buy bibles applaud it preach from it plead for it are proud of it yea who more busie about the bible and in a more uncessant search of endless scraping for more the scriptures then licentious luxurious lascivious ambitious unrighteous murderous envious maliciou lying persecuting schollers and that hate light which reproves their evill deeds which those that love truth in the inward parts love and come to yea our professing christians that say they are the iews and are not but do lye and are the synagogue of satan are iews in this at least of searching scripture and looking into the letter for life which testifie of christ as the life to whom they will not come in his own light that they may have it and of talking from the letter of christ the son of god yet refusing to hear his voice when hee speaks to them in their own hearts and thereby leaves them without cloak for their sin and seeing and hating both christ and his father in the light that shews them as much as christ and his children hate the devil and his deeds

finally as the text sayes every evill doer in the world hates the light but there are millions of evill doers that neither love nor hate the letter nor the bible which they never so much as saw or heard of therefore the letter cannot be the light here spoken of men cannot hate that they have no way heard of as neither can they love or desire it for there is no odium toward that at all which is no way known at all neither savingly nor otherwise as there is ignoti null a cupido

as to this text therefore which with the and
vers is no less then nine or ten times over rehearsed one where or others in thy book have had it so often under my eye that have hardly forbore so long from talking with thee about it and there is yet a place behinde whereunto thought might have reserved the examination of it it being there urged with two more in the way thou callest inartificial proof of the scriptures being the word of god
but now shall here consider it whilst its under my hand where its urged in vindication of the letter to bee the light which letter if it be the light there spoken of then will yeeld it to be the word of god there spoken of also for shall grant its both of these if either and if it be not both thou must needs grant its neither the verse runs thus but we have a more sure word of propesie or prophetical word undefined span alphabet to which ye do well to give heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place untill the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts
and the two that follow it thus for no prophecy of scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophesie came not at any time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy spirit

rep thy often repetition of this scripture upon every occasion imports the great stress thou puttest upon it and how great store thou settest by it as to the proof of the scriptures being the word of prophesie and the

light shining in the dark place of mens hearts here mentioned which text with the context both which thou improvest to the uttermost will us rather to reprove thy ignorance of gods word by and to prove thy heart to bee still a dark place then serve thee from which to prove the scripture to bee the word of god or to be the light here said to shine in the dark place there spoken of which is the heart exitus acta probat

from this text considered together with the context thou confidently concludest assertest and insistest on five things

that all the scripture letter or writing in the original texts of it which is now bound up in your bibles and commonly called the scriptures was written at by holy men as they were acted in it by the immediate inspiration of the spirit of god and this shall neither deny nor put thee to prove though if should see where thou wouldest falter and be foundred in it but to let that pass here this am sure enough of that this place proves no such matter as that as tis above laid down neither in terminis nor by consequence for though it sayes holy men of god spake of old i.e prophesied as moved by the holy spirit yet it from thence follows not that all that ever holy men of god wrote in point of history chronicle nor prophesie neither was written by the same immmediate impulse of the spirit on the spirits of the penmen of all that is there for some was written from the mouth of such as were inspired by the hands of others that were not the men inspired nor moved to give forth the burden of the word of prophesie that was on them as baruch wrote from ieremies mouth tertius from pauls and so others what they spake and was written by and from them was one thing and the writing or scripture of that true word is another which yet own to bee of god as far as ye can from it or any other rationally assert the text to be even in matter of chronicle or story wherein men may possibly write true scriptures of things done in their times and times before them from records and other principles without that immediate inspiration or dictation of every iota or tittle to them as thou tatlest somewhere from the holy spirit of god and lest thou shouldest not take this for truth to me who am here in contest with thee being prejudiced against me hear what thy against the qua t.d sayes for can almost at any time as paul did the pharisees and sadduces who when they were both upon the back of him threw a bone that set them together by the ears between themselves and so save himself add his testimony to the truth from them both act

set our stribes pharsees and seducers at oddes within themselves and send them to learn the truth we tell and they will not take from us from the testimony of one another which t.d saith it follows not that because books are the books of prophets therefore they are divinely inspired for they might as well write from their own spirits or upon human credit as sometimes speak from their own spirits

and in this sense thou strivest undefined span alphabet to be taken which thou sayest some think is put for undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet
and one copy undefined span alphabet by an evident error or mistake without ground

and much more ado then needs thou there makest to have undefined span alphabet denote the writing of the scriptures to be by men that were moved by the publick spirit of god and not by mans private spirit nor at his will but gods which grant and a little more too whether undefined span alphabet signifie so much or not viz
that it neither is to be interpreted now it is so given forth at the will of man or by mans private spirit or by our own of its sense and meaning
which sense see thou wouldest fain exclude undefined span alphabet from bearing or having in any tollerable sense affixed to it and cannot blame thee as thy principles are for else thou who deniest the presence and guidance of the infallible spirit to all men in these dayes must cut off thy self and fellow doctors divines and expositors of the scriptures from medling much by your own conceptions thoughts understandings and wills to interpret open or give your senses and fancies on them by which craft you have your wealth but only alone by the publick spirit of god which gave them out and only knows his own minde and meaning and reveals it to those that walk therein and not after the flesh as ye do for we saith paul of himself and those ministers have the minde of christ cor

so give thee thy sense and more then thou wouldest willingly have as concerning the of the scripture which men in their private thoughts are not to expound nor yet to deem it as meer private mens writings

howbeit none of all this comes out of this place so clearly as thou conceivest for it speaks not of the letter and writing so much as thou in thy private spirit interpretest it to do but of the truth or holy things written for whereas thou who doest not see that undefined span alphabet is one thing and undefined span alphabet is another takest the prophesie of scripture it intends the prophesie it self that was as to the summe of it written but not the writing that is of it which prophesie whether written by the hands or spoken by the mouthes of holy men of god who live in the spirit was not to bee interpreted as the written or spoken doctrines of private men that speak and write from the conceivings of their own narrow private spirits the figment and imagination

of whose hearts is the fountain of all they utter write or speake but as the undoubted infallible eternal truth of the living god made manifest in them which they wrote and spoke forth as moved by gods publick holy spirit


that the letter scripture or writing or copies of the original texts as ye have them at this day are that word of god called there the word of prophesie

that they are a more sure word in their evidence to us at least though not in themselves then any voice from heaven whatever yea then gods own if hee should speak to us from heaven or then that voice by which hee spake from heaven which peter james and john heard when they were with christ on the holy mount

that the said letter of the scripture is the light said there to shine in the dark place of mans hearts with an eminent advantage to its own discovery as well as unto the benefit of others
all which three last assertions not only deny to follow from this text as did the two first which yet deny not the truth of but do as much deny them all three or any one of them to bee truth at all as do absolutely deny all or either of them to bee possibly by any sound reason to bee deduced or inferred from this place and likewise affirm that measure of the light and spirit of god and christ in the hearts and consciences of men which we bear testimony unto to be the more sure word of prophesie and light here testified to by peter
and the grounds of my denial of the one of these viz
that the letter is it and of my affirming the other viz that the light is it are clear from two or three clauses of the text it self which are proper and the very import of the phrases and truly and plainly agreeable to the light or spirit or word of god within but not a tall true or proper or in truth agreeable to the letter without if predicated thereof for first it is as much as i.o jeers at the verbum seu lumen internum said to be the word and light within and so the letter without is not if it were either the word or the light therefore it cannot bee the letter ad extra which labours for against the light and t.d also who

thou meanest sure for there the word scriptures is named but what of that and who doubts or denies but that the word in the heart was written as well as preached and testified to by writing as well as by word of mouth but wilt thou ever be so blinde i.o as to make no difference but when it serves thy turn to do it as thou thinkest against the truth for then thou makest a difference

hee sayes to the contradicting of himself in what he asserts as to the minority of its evidence to us then that of the scripture hath undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet accompanying it as evidences it self and ascertains the soul beyond all possibility of mistake and is that which we are at last to rest in as being discernable from and obliging men to discern it from all delusions though yet rotas to go round again the scripture is that with him that is ultimately to be rested in and not the voice of god which he sayes may counterfeited witness the same pages

where hee bems in and hedges up his speech concerning the infallible certainty of gods voice beyond all possibility of mistake and concerning our resting ultimately in that a parte ante with this saying viz
suppose god should speak to us from heaven as he spake to moses or as he spake to christ or from some certain place how should wee bee able to know it to bee the voice of god cannot satan cause a voice to be heard in the air and so deceive us or may not there be some way found out whereby men might impose upon us their delusions
pope caelestine thought he heard a voice from heaven when it was but the cheat of his successour must we not rest at last in the undefined span alphabet that accompanies the true voice of god evidencing it self and ascertaining the soul beyond all possibility of mistake a parte post with this saying viz
if the question be whether the proposed to bee beleeved are truths of god or cunningly devised fables we are sent to the scripture it self and that alone to give the determination
thus ultimately we are to rest in gods voice and yet ultimately we must rest in the scripture which is another thing for those that heard and searcht the scripture as shewed above never at any time heard gods voice though yet beleeve i.o to bee so sottish to suppose the scripture or writing to bee it from which yet himself sometimes distinguisheth it

now the scripture the letter what ever thou sayest of it to the contrary i.o specially as to the present corrupted copies of it which are your canon are not sure much less a surer matter then the immediate voice of god neither in that false sense in which i.o interprets that term more sure viz more unquestionable and undoubtedly evident to bee of god for if wee grant it to be of equal divine certainty as we need not it being as now but the remote issue and product at the hundredth hand perhaps of gods voice in the prophets yea but remote transcripts of fallible men from the handywork or manuscripts of the first penmen yet to say its of greater divine certainty then gods own voice is absurdity in the abstract nor yet secondly in that genuine sense which the term undefined span alphabet most properly bears viz more firm stable stedfast standing permanent or the like for the letter is changeable alterable flexible passing perishing corruptible at mans will who may turn tear change alter burn it and so flecting and transient but as for that voice surer then which i.o sayes the scripture is which scripture he calls the light or the word of prophesie and the prophesie of scripture mistaking himself when it is but the scripture of the prophesie undefined span alphabet

that voice was as infallibly sure to its evidencing it self to them that heard it to be of god as any thing can bee though so permanent it was not as the light within is the voice of god that is to be heard in the heart of those that take heed to and turn not away from it for that particular voice that came to them from god saying of christ hear ye him was passing and transient not abiding staying and standing as to the actual of it but the voice and word of the son in the heart of whom the father said hear ye him this is permanent lasting standing stable sure stedfast alwayes nigh in the heart of men that they may both hear and do it

and this and not the scripture or undefined span alphabet which i.o scrafles for is the undefined span alphabet the undefined span alphabet the undefined span alphabet the more sure word or prophesie of scripture i.e that that scripture writes of or the light shining in the dark place of the heart good to be taken heed to here spoken of even the voice of christ speaking from heaven in the heart and conscience of whom the father sayes vers
hear him whose voice his sheep hear and who ever hears not in whatever he sayes shall be cut off from among his people whose voice which shakes the old earth and heaven where its heeded its more dangerous to turn from then tis to turn from moses and the prophets and holy mens outward writings for these whether old or latter speak and write though by motion from god yet on earth only· but hee commeth from heaven and is above all as iohn baptist said of himself and christ ioh

am not the christ am but sent before him he hath the bride
am but the bridegrooms friend who stand and hear him rejoycing at his voice he must increase must decrease he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from above is above all see therfore saith paul he

that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven

yea not the letter but this voice and light in the heart this inwardly undefined span alphabet ingrafted innate word or spirit imparted implanted indelibly in mens consciences is as god and christs vicegerent there both revealing what hee requires of every man as to his own particular and taking account of him also in the name majesty and authority of god de facto how he answers it which voice or light of god and christ in the conscience is called by thee
the innate or ingrafted light of nature the voice of god in nature and common and general presumptions of god and his authority inlaid in the natures of rational creatures and innate principles of reason and conscience and such like as if they were so de naturae de esse hominis so flowing from the meer natural being of men that they can be no more said to be supernaturally of god then the very natural faculties of reason understanding and conscience it self of which more an on both with thee and t.d also though it be indeed that very way of supernatural revelation which thou sayest
the scripture is that as now in the world is handed to thee by the meer improvement of natural faculties in the way of transcribing printing as also studied by the meer improvement of your natural faculties of reading remembring understanding hebrew greek latine english to the begetting of a meer animal or natural knowledge whereby yee know things meerly naturally speaking evil of what yee know not and corrupting your selves in what ye do know naturally as bruit beasts for as a horse or bullock can finde the way to the pasture where hee hath often been so the priests by use course custome and concordance more than the work of the spirit bringing all things to their remembrance can turn readily to chapter and verse

which forsaid voice or light that god as thou sayest truly
hath indelibly implanted in the minds of men for the minde heart and conscience is as a dark place as to all spiritual moral and supernatural knowledge

without the law or light of god shining in it and shewing good and evill is by thy own further confession to thy own further confusion accompanied with a moral instinct of good and evil seconded by that which god hath placed in us in reference to his own over us and that by which god reveals himself to the sons of men and that indispensable moral obedience which he requireth of us as his creatures subject to his law and which is as effectual to reveal god as his works are to which there is need of nothing as thou sayest but that they be represented or objected to the consideration of rational crtatures and bears testimony to the being righteousness power omniscience holiness of god himself and calls for moral obedience which is eternally and indispensably due to him and so shews the work of the law written in the heart and is that by which the gentiles or nations that have not the law in a letter are a law to themselves and more then all this by thy own absolute acknowledgement whereby tis evident that it even that thou callest the voice of god and the law written in the hearts of the very gentiles and not the letter of the law written without with ink and pen is that ingrafted word by every one to be received with meekness jam
which is able to save the soul and that sure word as to it its evidencing it self to us or light shining in the dark place of the heart and that more firm stedfast constant standing permanent word or light or rule of life to us then that infallibly sure and certain though passing and transient voyce that in the audience of peter iames and iohn came from god himself that is here spoken of the said voice or light in the heart declares it self to be from god by its own light and authority so that there is no need to convince a man by substantial witnesses that what his conscience speaks it speaks from god what ever testimony it bears or what ever it calls for from us in his name and so speaks and declares it self not only more constantly as its ever with men but as to its certainty also that without further evidence or reasoning without the advantage of any considerations but what are by it self supplied it discovers its author from whom it is and in whose name is speaks and is inlaid by the hand of god to this end to make a revelation of him as to the purposes mentioned is able to evince its own divine original without the least contribution of strength or assistance from without and therefore adde without an outward letter undoubtedly though as undoubtedly an outward letter cannot do all nor any of all this without the light or said voice word or spirit of christ within which only doth and can evidence it unto the conscience that the letter scripture and doctrines declared therein are of so divine an original as they are

thus have done with that text which is so much talked on so little to their own purpose by the most eminent talkers for the text of the scripture as that thing therein recommended to us to bee taken heed to as the most sure word of prohesie the light shining in the dark place of mens hearts the prophesie of the scripture that is not of private interpretation but spoken forth in writing in the movings of the holy spirit under which termes the holy apostle intends not the outward text in which as well as otherwhile by word of mouth the holy men testified to it and held it forth but that inward word light spirit of prophesie truth witness and testimony of iesus in the conscience which their outward voice words witness and writings were but a testimony unto and an external means to turn men to upon the

account of which text in peter and the
other aforesaid which i.o impannels as his jury to judge the case in question whether the letter outward writing or scripture is the spiritual light or word of god yea or nay i.o makes such a full account to carry it his way and to have their unanimous universal verdict for him that the letter is the light and consequently the most perfect rule and consequently the word of god that in his blind hasty confidence he cannot stay from stiling it so till the trial about it be ended and while the cause is and he but in his prosecution of the proof thereof but by way of anticipation as it were throughout his whole book which is written mostly in ordine ad probationem as an enquiry after and examination of the matter he very often here and there if not as frequently and commonly as by its own proper names of letter writing text or scripture stiles and denominates it under the foresaid names of of the light rule foundation witness vvord of god as its nomen which hee will never prove to bee proper to it whilest hee breathes

and so hee runs on blindly in such over ample applaudings and most mighty magnifications of the scripture that is the subject about which the argument is driven on by what termes soever whether of the truth the foundation the power of god the rule the vvitness of god the vvord of god hee expresses it by that if he were set to extoll and set forth christ jesus himself in all his dignity authority dominion might majesty and glory unless it be the express names of the only beloved and begotten son of god king of kings lord of lords mighty god the the prince of peace and perhaps some few more can scarcely suppose on a sudden that he could finde any other or at least any more eminent titles to dignifie him by then those by which hee dignifies not to say deifies his adored dead transcript text and corps of the greek and hebrew copies of the scriptures which hee vermilions over with the honour and veneration as to sundry of the most excellent glorious titles and properties hee attributes to it that is due either to god or christ or his living vvord light and spirit alone for howbeit every such particular expression of vvonderful councellor leader and commander to the people redeemer saviour salvation that christ is stiled by may possibly not bee used in i.os book to express the outer scriptures by yet beleeve there is but little asserted in honour of christ the spirit the living light and vvord througout the scripture which is not asserted if not in the same yet in termes equivalent in honour of the scripture it self
witness all those most high flown phrases and eminent strains he flyes out and strikes up in in way of ascribing little less then all authority dominion exaltation transaction efficacy light power dignity and glory here on earth at least unto the scriptures as if the father had sealed it and not his son and spirit to be the disposer and orderer of all things next and immediately under himself as supream iudge rule ruler head and governour over the sons of men and the giver and dispenser of the meat that endureth to eternal life

and now return to take more notice of what more is urged in his latine theses as concerning the scriptures being the only most perfect rule of faith life worship· and knowledge of god as to salvation
the second argument in proof whereof is its perfect operation and efficacy ex

omnia perficit necessaria it accomplishes all that is necessary to gods glory and our salvation in vindication of which a whole dozen of scriptures are urged eleven of which are above answered and one onely remains to be a little spoken to viz isa
and as to that of isa
grant that the word of god as the rain and snow comes down and returns not without watering the earth and causing it to bring forth and bud and give seed and food so it returns not void at any time without working that for which he sends it to any person or people and prospering to the accompliment of what he pleases but am half amazed to see that thou i.o shouldest bee so silly as to interpret that of the scripture since it so expresly speaks de verbo oris sui of the word of his mouth which is asserted immediately from himself with his own voice so shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth which word expressed by his own voice speaking who so upon second thoughts and serious consideration shall say the scriptures are properly too as i.o excusing his ignorance for as much as not for want of incogitancy my self sometimes so thought while ran as our national ministry now doth making haste and saying he saith before himself had sent mee howbeit wanted no sending of man or had spoke to me or heard his voice shall make bold to accuse him of arrant absurdity miserable mistake wretched blindness and utter unrthiness to bee denominated a doctor in that thing which our divines call divinity

nevertheless not having so well minded the matter as upon occasion they may do in time to come being carried in times past by custome to take things and term and talk of them according to tradition more then true discerning of them in their proper natures the very preachers of this nation as well as the poor people that have lived on their lips have been so habituated by common metonymies to miscall the scriptures by names not proper to their natures that they now stand up to depend them to be most properly denominated by those metonymical and improper names so that howbeit we are never so willing to allow them to express themselves by such figurative phrases as are frequently found in the scripture it self as act

the voices i.e scriptures of the prophets are said to be read in the iews synagogues every sabbath and that satisfies them not but the qua are deniers both of the scriptures and of the word of god and spoylers of them of their proper names if they yeeld not to their as absurd as arbitrary appellations of them by those glorious titles of gods words gods voice as their proper names yea in this dotish disquierness and peevish perversnes of his prejudiced spirit doth i·o quarrel with the quakers as bereavers of the scripture of its proper name because they own not his improperties in ignorantly and impudently imposing the names of the word of god and the

spiritual light on the letter as its proper names which it to it self from its preheminent participation of the nature and properties of the word of god and of light viz
life power to quicken and save and to shine to the evidencing of it self

j.o
am now to deal against the qua about the proper name of the scripture for this sort of men are glad that the care of this business is committed to them by satan that they may spoil the scriptures of that glorious title the word of god this name doth the scripture challenge to it self
so
that the scripture is light we shall see that is so or can be called so unless it hath this nature and properly to evidence it self as well as to give light to others cannot in any tolerable corespondency of speech be allowed whether spiritual intellectual light regarding the minde or natural with respect to bodily sight be firstly or properly light need not inquire both have the same properties it is spiritual moral intellectual light with all its mediums that hath the preheminence as to a participation of the nature and properties of light
now the scripture the word of god

is light a light in a dark place pet

with an eminent advantage for its own discovery a glorious shining light an illuminating light compared and preferred the light of the sun psal
rom
the most glorious light in the world the most eminent reflexion of increased light and excellencies the psalmist ascribeth light power stability and permanency like that of the heavens and sun in commutation of properties to the word i.e scripture with i.o and an inexpressible exaltation of it above them the light of one day of this sun meaning the scripture which hee expresses by the terme the word of god being unspeakably more then that of seven others as to the manifesting the glory of god nor doth it impaire this efficacy of the scripture that it is a moral spiritual not a natural light
this and much more utters i.o concerning these termes of the word the light as the proper names of the right belonging to the letter

neither is i.o alone in this but some others have met with that have stifly stood up to defend the scripture or letter to be the light the word of god yea verbum oris the word of his mouth and the voice of god and christ properly and properly to be so called

rep which sayings the contrariety that is in them to common sense and reason they may as well say they hear that mans voice properly some of whose sayings they read in the letters of such as write what they heard him say they may as properly say they are to own the voice of the scribes and pharisees for their rule as they are written down by the apostles and evangelists sith christ saith they sit in moses chair all that they say do and that they do now properly hear their voyces sith what they said was recorded as say that they now properly hear christs voice in

reading some things he spake as they are written by them that heard him speak them and stablish and canonize them and other mens sentences as the only standing rule on this account because god said hear him and they now hear properly moses voice and must own his law that vanisht as to the shadow of it still to the church a standing rule because christ said they have moses and the prophets let them hear them
the contrarity of this to the scriptures themselves for if they be properly the voice of god and christ then absit blaspemiae they make christ charge the scribes improperly and falsely that they never at any time heard gods voice joh
for they heard the scriptures read every sabbath neither could he say truly what he doth exclusively of such as are not his sheep my sheep hear my voice if the scriptures were his voice properly for the dogs and swine hear and hear the outward scriptures read as well as his sheep but his sheep hear another secret still voice of his in all things that hee saith unto them in their own consciences which the loud brawlers for the bare bible drown within themselves with their notes and noyses about their diana's and shrines and temple worship and church work which voice and words of his are heard in secret with more profit among the wise luke
then the cry of the truth selling spirit stealers among fools which still voice of christs whoever hears not and heeds not more then our heady hypocrites of these dayes do may preach themselves out a while longer yet as the ministers and church of christ but shall ere long be cut off from among his people in the mean time however this is the improper tone they tune it out in when we bid them fear god hearken to his voice own that as your only guide his word his voice his spirit his light as the only infallible sure standard the witness of god himself the scripture witnesses of and sends men to which hee that heeds follows beleeves in obeyes needs not be so restless by wrangling as the wrestless for and wresters of the scripture are about the witness of man though witnessing from and for god as moved by him for the witness of god himself and the witness of christ himself in the conscience is greater needs not be so loud for a letter for the voyces and words of men and the writings and revelations of holy men for the inward immediate voyce the word the spirit the light revelation of christ himself in the heart is greater
true say they we must hear christs voice in all things he sayes abide in his doctrine or teaching receive his witness and testimony walk by his word live by his light alone bee guided and ordered in all things by his spirit which alone reveals the minde of god and christ without whose revelation none knows the things of god and christ but the letter of the scripture the outward writings of such as heard him as we do not the hebrew and greek text at least and as they keep touch with them these are that word that living powerful word those words of his that are spirit and life by which alone men must come to beleeve that light to the feet that lamp to the path that verbum oris that very word of his mouth that works and accomplishes all things to his glory our salvation that verbum oris that goeth forth of his own mouth that hee put according to his promise isa

and all this and much more exclusively and abstractively from that within yea and properly too so that the word of god foundation the rule light lamp and so consequently all the rest of the are the very proper names of the scriptures no other then what are properly answerable to its nature

for in this wife i.o drives on the business avouching that glorious title of the word of god and the light to be the nomen proprium scripturae the proper name of the scripture and that wrong him not herein see his own stating the question between himself and the qua ex

de scripturae nomine proprio nimirum titulo illo glorioso verbo dei and
the scripture is a light yet is nor can be called so unless it hath the nature and property of light

light spiritual hath the preheminence as to a participation of the nature and properties of light firstly and properly light from whence the other i.e natural respecting bodily sight is by allusion so denominated in these places either expresly or eventually i.o calls the light and word of god the proper names of scripture or letter and so consequently all the other glorious titles to it as its right due and proper names which they rob it of and deny it to be what it naturally and properly and really is who own it not properly both to be and be called the word of god but it neither is actually testified so to be any whereby god nor by its self as i.o
most lyingly falsely affirms it in so much that he who owns it not as so doth what in him lyes to make god a lyar

but what's all this to the helping of i.o in his crazy cause whose fighting is not all for figures or meer denominations but for the formal and true proper names of the scripture which is the name of the scripture and not the word of god say we but is saith he that of the word of god had he fought for no more then figures against the qua that stand for the truth and said so too though in so fighting he had been foolish yet we could have born with him in that frivolous peece of and have lent him such a latitude as both by the letter and light may bee allowed to speak metonimically and metaphorically of methaphorical matters and left him to his liberty without a check and let him alone in his figures to figure out things by other names then their own and to call them that which yet properly they are not to stile the they sit in by the name of the parliament which it is not to stile the picture by the name of the person it is the image of the voice by the name of the word it is but the image of and the scripture by that of the word it is but the remote expression of and of the voice it is the more immediate image or expression of for vox est imago verbi scriptura vocis immediata verbi quaedam mediata imago seu expressio and to signifie the wine and the light respectively by the names of this cup this glass this lanthorn and the word and law by the name of a scripture specially if by scripture he mean that inward writing of it by the spirit of the living god in the fleshly tables of the heart where the law of god is written though that writing and the word written are not all one neither and we could bate him the impropriety of that figurative expression also though it be far further fetcht then the other whereby he should decypher that outward letter by the name of the law which it is but a bart copy of and the written word by the name of the writing which yet in truth doth no more then declare of the word retro though know not where in

all the scripture the srripture is so much as by a figure denominated by that name the word of god if the word be any where so called by the name of scripture as i.o sayes at least fortyfold falsely that above fifty times in the new testament the word graphs or scripture is put absolutely for the word of god but if it were a hundred and fifty times so called it would not prove the high point in that height he takes on him to prove it in viz that the scripture is properly the word of god and the word of god its proper name any more then the wine is called by the name of this cup this glass or the light by the name of the lanthorn retro the lanthorn by name of this light which is all figurative not proper

but this is not i.os case who runs up to the very highest peg and sings of the scriptures a note above the ela and quarrels with the qua as deniers of the scripture unless they swerve aside with him in his silly and as well as sensless sayings that the scripture the writing the letter and every letter and tittle and iota though but transcribed in it is the word of god as

about the proper name of the scripture and to stablish it under that glorious title the word of god as that proper name of it which the chief business committed by satan to the qua that they rejoyce in is to spoyl it of yea how will all those figurative forms of speech list i.o out of that wherein he sticks and into which he hath run himself by his hasty quarrelling with the qua who is far from being satisfied if the truth and doctrine of the scriptures be confessed to be sufficiently declared in the scripture unless he be infallibly assured that every tittle and iota as it was at first written stands truly transcribed in his copies of it and so far from being satisfied if by a figure it should be granted as it need not for its no where called so that the scripture is the word of god that he professes ex
that if that declaration that writing which declares the minde and will of god be not the word of god he knows not what is the word of god if he may not call the scriptures by that name the word of god is so far ignorant of any name else to call it by as to call out to the qua to tell him what to call it if he may not call it by that name si hoc non sit verbum dei quoth i.o ego nescio quid sit aut deceant nos fanatici quid illud dicendum sit if the declaration of the will of god i.e the scripture be not the word of god know not what it is or let the fanaticks teach us what we may call it these and many more to the like tune are the eminent titles which i.o not by a metonymy but in truth as their proper priviledge and real right attributes in words at length and not in figures to the outer scriptures these are the lofty terms wherein in throughout all his treatises he treats on their behalf not with all others only that are his opposers in other matters but with the qua also who own the scripture in its own proper name use

and place and own the truth written of to be the word much more then he doth himself but about the scriptures oppose him only as to these his childish thoughts such are the high rigid unrighteous strickt streins he stands upon and stickles in and that so stifly that he is minded either to win all or lose all and if he be not owned as stiling of the scripture truly and properly when he stiles it by the names of other things which truly and properly it is not he will no more own it under its own true and proper names of writing letter scripture but make himself altogether ignorant of these as if hee had quite forgotten and could in no wise call to minde that hee hath any other names at all whereby it can be called save those undue ones of his own imposing

now when a man begins to swell out with his wind of doctrine into such a bubble as knows no bounds its time to blow him out and when he grows into such a giddy greedy hydropical humour as not to know what ground he stands on nor how to stand still and sit down satisfied when hee is well nor well to understand when he hath enough nor to slack his thirst with a just and lawful allowance its good occurre morbo danda est elleboritali pars maxima avaro

and if hee shall flye out so far in his whifling words as to call the letter which to the light bears the same and no better proportion then that of the lanthorn to the candlelight the light as the name that is proper to it and flye up higher yet till according to his flashy fancy thereof he affirms it in print as hee doth before the world that not only the word of god written of in the writing which none denies so to be but the writing it self also which he means in every place by that terme the word or else hee strikes beside the iron and lies hammering on the anvil beating the air and meaning another matter then that hee meant when he began and makes men beleeve that he means all along which is no more to his purpose then if he meant nothing by it at all is an illuminating shining spiritual light and higher yet preferred above the light of the sun

finally to persue yet a little further and prosecute our present matter under the metaphor of the parliament and the house if a man should arise and stand up and contend that the house the parliament meets in is the parliament properly and none shall perswade him to beleeve otherwise but he will try it out with them that allow him to call the house by a figure or metonymy of the thing containing for the thing contained so as to say this house is the parliament and will say the parliament is the proper name of the house and it may properly challenge that to it self and they rob it of its true and due name and are enemies to both the parliament and the house and traytors that will not so own it to be and shall say die mihi tell me what it is to be called if not so not heeding that himself calls it the house where the parliament sits and that that is the most proper name of it should judge that man utterly unfit to be chosen a or if he should be chosen as unmeet to meet there among the rest as

in regard of his i.o himself once chosen to that honour as hear was thought unmeet to meet among them
or to prosecute the matter rather under that metaphor of the lanthorn and the light that shines in it with which the letter and the light the writing and the word doth so exactly correspond and hold proportion if there should appear such a man as would not be contented by the metonymy only to call the lanthorn the light it self which makes out it self thereby and other things also to the view of others but stand up to contend tooth and nayl that the lanthorn is the very light in very deed and ought so to be denominated as that which really is so yea and every inch of it from the top to the very bottome or else it is spoyled of its own glorious due and proper name and denied to be what it is and abused and depressed quite below it self debased and disgraced at their peril of mens utter for their damnable unbeleef though they beleeve own and acknowledge it to be a very special good serviceable profitable clear useful and perfect lanthorn above all other lanthorns as to all ends and purposes for which it was at first made and framed unless they see it with such eyes as his own and beleeve it with himself to be veraciter the real light and only rule and guide of the way that mafests both it self and all things else that are needful to be seen to all such as are to and within the sight of it and as concerning the light it self which reveals both it self and the lanthorn and the dark room also round about wherein it shines and shews it self and other things as well yea more brightly when its beheld immediately and is abstracted from the lanthorn which it reveals and in which to say the truth it self is more properly vailed then revealed

for the light or new testament is vail'd in the old the old letter revealed in the new will not beleeve there is any such thing nor without impatience hear the testimony of those that testifie of it unto him and tell him that he is mistaken tis not the lanthorn that enlightens the room as he supposes for that is though transparent yet a dark body of it self that can no more by and of it self without somewhat else i.e the light to manifest evidence either it self or other things then a stool or chair or any such opacous body like it self but it is another thing within it that shews it self in some measure through it and as the whole room and all things therein are by it most evidently seen when it stands and shines in the room and is severed from it and that its that light only and not the lanthorn that can properly challenge to it self that name of light and that the lanthorn under no consideration whatsoever whether formally considered in its own proper nature as an instrument made into that form of of a lanthorn of such materials as wood horn tin glass or the like nor yet quatenus containing the light in it

either or can properly be

said to be the light at all but the man will rather vilifie and utterly nullifie the light for the lanthorns sake so that men become his enemies for telling him the truth about it and his hand is up and at work against every man whose hand is against his crude conceptions stigmatizing them in print as poor erroneous foolish fanatical knaves ex
deluded dreamers and belying the light as a meer imagined peece of business a figment of fanaticks fanaticisme enthuss dotage ex

nelcio quid vere nihil and moreover if the said man will not only positively assert but also not blush to profess in effect that if the lanthorn be not to be called the light he knows not what to call it and thereupon call out to such as deny it to tell and teach him what the lanthorn is to be called if it be not properly to be called the light saying you must either call it the light aut doceat nos aliquis quid dicendum id sit and lastly shall not blush to put himself upon the proof thereof against all that shall gainsay the lanthorn to be the light and that in no better then such a piteous either flatly false or foul and fallacious manner as here under followeth viz


the lanthorn doth sufficiently evidence it self to be the light therefore most assuredly unquestionably incontroleably infallibly the lanthorn is the light by which men must see or not at all in which enthememe the antecedent is as most assuredly unquestionably uncontroleably infallibly false as i.os saying that the letter doth so evidence it self to be the light and consequently the conclusion yet this is i.os way
for thou triest it out in these termes which are the truest though the more thou keepest to them the more false thy propositions as to the matter asserted in them both are and do appear viz the letter the scriptures the vvriting with every tittle and iota that is therein arguing as aforesaid thus the scriptures do abudantly infallibly incontroleably manifest themselves to be the vvord of god therefore we know the scriptures assuredly to bee the word of god tr



which argument is fair and not fallacious yet its frame not more fair then its antecedent flatly false understood as it must be by thee if there be at all such thing as uniformity in thy two enlish treatises and not so much noniformity as that we may not safely judge of thy meaning in that word scriptures in one place by thy own expression and explanation of it in another of the writing or the written letter and the transcribed tittles and iotaes of it the falsity of which antecedent as uttered in such open termes being not unlikely seen by thy self to be too obvious to be seen by others thou fetchest it about in a way of fallacy acting arguing minus caste but magis cause from this foundation

or else thus viz
the light in the lanthorn tr


doth evidence it self to him that is not blinde to be the light
therefore the lanthorn is and is assuredly known to be the light in which the antecedent is most true but the consequence denied as no less false and fouly fallacious then the other is true and as a non sequitur as tis to say the light declared of in the letter is known to bee the word or light which is fallacia consequentis yet this is i.os way of arguing

viz
by this light in the scripture for which we contend doth the scripture make such a proposition of it self as the word of god that whoever rejects it doth it at the peril of his eternal ruine
therefore wee know and others may bee assured that the scripture is the vvord of god

in which argument mulier formosa superne definit in piscem
the antecedent is most fair and true let him be anathema that denies the light in the scripture to be the word of god but the consiquence is fouly false fallacia consequentis and consequently the conclusion for it follows not because the light in the scripture or vvord of god declared in it is so that therefore the scripture it self is the word of god
or else
thus viz
that which doth evidence it self to be the light is the light but the lanthorn the light doth evidence it self to be the light
therefore wee may assuredly know that the lanthorn the light is the light
which argument were it urged interrogatively thus viz doth not the lanthorn the light evidence it self to be the light therefore is not the lanthorn the light were fallacia plurium interrogationum the fallacy whereby one thing is askt of two things at once which is true of one of them but false if affirmed of both but formed positively tis fallacia either divisionis whereby the sophister concludeth that to be true of two things joyned together as one which is true of but one of them i.e of the light considered figillatim or a part or else petitionis principii or a disputation exfalso supposit is from a false supposition of that which is not or of that to be granted which is not granted but remains as the main matter yet to be proved viz that the lanthorn and the light are all one which yet is the way of os proving the scriptures to be the word and light tr


the scripture or written word of god and
the scripture the word of god is light therefore we may assuredly know that the scripture is the of god
or else
thus making no express mention of the lanthorn at all which is the main subject that is to be proved to be the light viz if the light doth uncontrolably evidence it self to be the light then we do infallibly know that the light is the light and properly so called
but the light doth uncontroleably evidence it self to be the light
therefore we infallibly know that the light is the light and properly so called which is i.os manner of speech sometimes tr


the word of god is furnisht with innate arguments for the manifestation of it self to be the word of god
so
where ever the word comes there is a sufficiency of light in it to evidence to all the authority of god
that its the word and evidence of truth commending it self to the conscience of men no want of light in the truth it self
the word makes a sufficient proposition of it self where it is leave the word to men and if it evidence not it self to them it is because they are blinded
so tr


thy word is truth
over all his name god magnifies his word in all which places in an honest way of proof of the scripture to be the word of god that term of scripture should have stood in the stead of that terme the word of god but then the falseness had been obvious therefore we infallibly know the word of god is the word of god and properly so called

in which argument a man may take his choice of fallacies and of two call it which he pleases or both if he will and do him no wrong whose it is

for as there is a begging of the grand question in the dispute and a taking it aforehand for granted which is not granted but denied and to be proved viz
that the lanthorn is the light the writing the word which is called petitio principii so there is a concluding aliud a negato another thing which is owned and not contradicted nor gainsayed viz that the light is the light when the thing denyed and to be proved i.e that the lanthorn is the light the writing the word is not affirmed in the conclusion at all which is called ignoratio elenchi when that is inferred as contradictory to the thing denied which doth in no wise contradict it

or else
thus viz the lanthornquatenus it contains the light may be the light
therefore the lanthorn may be said to be the light
which argument is fallacious being a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simplicitor for it follows not in any wise if we should yeeld as we need not that as it contains the light the lanthorn may be said to be the light that therefore it may properly be said so to bee much less that the light is the proper name of the lanthorn which is that which is undertaken to be proved by i.o for hee from secundum quid argues and sayes the letter non respectu literae scriptae as it is scripture but quatenns as it contains the divine truth is the word of god therefore the letter is the word of god simpliciter and the vvord of god is its proper name and nature
say if the said man shall not only flye up thus into the height of falshood in his assertion of the lanthorn to be the light the letter to bee the vvord decrying that altogether which is so indeed but also drive on his proof and evidence thereof in such a sorry way of either falsity or evident fallacy and deceit as this is though should not dare to deal any otherwise then fairly and openly with this man if should come to argue all the utter untruths utttered by him about the lanthorn back again upon as by and by am to syllogize back upon i.o his false tales about the scripture and though desire not that any man should bee caught with any other then that godly guile whereby paul caught many out of the deceit yet whether he that deals thus treacherously doth not deserve when he hath done ex lege talionis to be dealt treacherously withall isa
let wise men judge and according to their judgement let such fools act and execute which now am none of among whom fallentem fallere non est fraus to deceive the deceiver is no deceit

however thus much shall make bold to say of the man aforesaid that tis fit he should bee told barely of his bruitishnes and fully forewarned of both his falsness and his folly that he fall not into the like for the future and if he be indeed so blinde as he makes himself and so mean of memory as not to remember any name whereby the lanthorn or letter can bee called but that name of the light and vvord though himself calls it not the light or word only but by the name of lanthorn letter or scripture also save that trapezantius who in a long fit of sickness forgot his own name i.o forgets himself and heeds not that himself often calls the letter as others do by its only due and proper name of letter or scripture tis fit he should be plainly told what to call it and minded of it as here do tell and minde i.o who calls to the qua to tel him what to call the letter that the name of lanthorn by which though he forget that hee doth so himself

doth call the lanthorn and the name of scripture by which he though forgets it calls the scripture is a more proper name then those of light and the word of god and the most proper names that can possibly bee given to them

and if for all this he will obstinately oppose the truth and wilfully wa'k on without wisdome then nescio quid indeed the dotage being so deeply dyed into him that its scare like to depart if he be brayed in a morter know not what more to say but

nescioan anticcyram ratio illidestinet omnem

thou deemest will not say that men seeing a number of scriptures quoted by the dozen for so tis here as tis in sundry places above spoken to excepting that counting such as are twice over recited here is thirteen to the dozen of which it might be said nos numeri sumus would make account of them by to be all on thy side and take account of them not by weight but number without so much as looking otherwise on them then to see how many they are but not heed either what they say or whereof they affirm but some odde blinde business or other is ith wind as the reason of it know full well for there's not any of all the texts of thy own tumbling a top of one another that meet with yet either in this dozen or those before that hath the least tendency toward such a thing as thou intendest them to in thy meer nomenclateral citation of them

thou intendest by all these to prove there is now no other way of knowing god of communion with him but the scripture that there is now not only no other kinde of revelation of the gospel save such as was made of it to the writers of the scripture but also none of that same kinde of revelation of it as was made to them to be expected or on pain of damnation and cursing pretended to by any person by any means whether angels internal spirit that inward light the qua talk of or other medium whatsoever but only that very individual revelation of it that is made in so much of the letter as is now extant and bound in your bibles is and must be the only standard rule and measure to which no scripture must be added tho bounds of which no man for ever nor angel is for ever to inlarge so as to write any more though of the doctrine or gospel on so high a pretence as from the true inward illumination vision in the same true light or immediate motion or inspiration of the same holy spirit on pain or peril of utter rejection and execration

where also told thee of the lawfulness of talking with angels or receiving of revelation of the truth from angels unless thou wilt tax such as received the law which was given by the disposition of angels and daniel and mary and zachary cornelius and paul and iohn that wrote the revelation and christ himself who all were spoke to and ministred to by angels were these all guilty of sin and condemnation look again i.o on the words in english which thou greekest out perhaps to the further hoodwinking of idiots that ken not greek lest they should finde out thy folly who settest it for a cypher if rendred in plain latine which to give thee the reading as they stand in your translations run thus let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility or worshipping of angels is the talking of angels to men here deeply damned by the spirit of god as thou dreamest and
whats that text to prove there must be on pain of cursing no additament of more scripture or writing to that scripture that is in your bibles with pretence of immediate revelation of the same doctrine truth or gospel there taught from the same inward light and holy spirit which is the second purpose for which its cited a second time and again as to heb

must not his eyes be out that sees any such things hinted at here as those above the proof of which i.o intends by this quotation

because angels are here named inferiour unto christ therefore anathematized is he that hears or heeds any thing that shall be spoken to him by an angel though he reveal the same truth and not another seeing that truth is already written in the scripture yea cursed be hee from henceforth even for ever there's one of i.os
who consequently concludes iohn accursed that wrote the revelation from thenceforth even after this of paul to the colossians and the hebrews were written from whence forward i.o drives his execration downward to this day sith the said iohn

had his revelation immediately from an angel by whom christ who had it from the father sent and signified it to his servant iohn rev

and because christ is better then the angels and god in these last dayes speaks in and by him his only begotten son the light of the world the great shepherd and of the soul whose own voice his sheep hear warning all to hear him to hear his voice in all things what ever he sayes on pain of being cut off from among his people therefore the scripture must have no more writing though of the same truth that is there added to it on pain of damnation for ever there's the t'other of i.os
conclusions from heb
from which conclusion can much more clearly conclude that a cloud of darkness is drawn over i.os understanding and that a beam is in his eye then draw such an untruth as that no more scripture since iohns time was to be written by the holy spirits moving and added to that from that text which tells the truth if i.o would once heed it viz that the hour now is wherein god speaks to the sons of men in and by his own son whom he hath given to be a light and leader to all people wherein the dead must hear his voice before ever they live to god who since god speaks by him and hee by his own light spirit voice in i.os conscience why doth not i.o heed him then but scoffe at him in his inward light and spirit the qua call to as at christum quendam imaginarium infallibilem doctorem nescio quod lumen scu verbum internum nescio quem deum seu undefined span alphabet deoforsan quopiam melius for woe unto him that ever he was born if he repent not of it but run from him to the letter which doth but testifie of him and call to him in the reading and searching of which if he think he hears christs voice and gods voice truly then the scribes that read the scripture as much as hee could not be truly reprov'd ioh

which insisted so lately and so largely upon above if there were the weight of one half grain in it towards the turning of the scales to his purpose would weigh it once again but he that shall say these words we have a more sure word of prophesie to which yee do well if yee take heed as unto a light shining in a dark place till the day dawn and day star arise in your hearts hath ought in it if the letter of scripture were there meant as have shewed it is not to prove there must bee no more scripture written as from the spirit after that verse was written on pain of damnation as i.o doth for thats his drift in quoting it doth no more condemne the qua by that text of peter then he damn iohn himself whose revelation was written as by the spirit no little while after that
as to that cor
spoken to once before where met with it ex

yet twice here cited by i.o to the purpose as before from which because paul there sayes hee would have none think of him and apollos above what he wrote of himself and him as no more however idolized by the church then meer ministers by whom they beleeved
i.o concludes there must be no addition of more scripture to his canon

rep
if any man be minded to look so long till hee finde a pin in a pack

of wool which he may sooner do if lost there then finde i.os conclusion coming from the text aforesaid let him look till he is weary for mee who will meddle no more with that

and the same summarily and in short say of pet

another text of i.os urging for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in errour
rep he that will spend so much time as to study on that text till hee can duely draw either of these doctrines from it viz that the holy spirit downrightly damns
all addings whatsoever of more scripture or writing as from the spirit to that scripture now in the bible which our clergy calls their canon
and
all the wayes and means of knowing god and of communion with him even that internal spirit and light in the conscience to use os phrase boasted of by the qua as in some measure communicated to all men shall most assuredly have his labour for his pains
the same may be said of ioh
beloved beleeve not every spirit but try the spirits whether they he of god or no for many false prophets are gone out into the world

rep what damnation is thundred out here at all to the adding of any thing or revelation that is true to the outward writing or scripture where the scripture is neither talked on nor intended he talks of spirits there and not letters much more what follows thence to the condemnation of the inward light and spirit the qua talk of call to live and walk and hold communion with god in now according to the counsel of the scriptures as abel noah and all holy men of god did from the beginning before the scripture was is this to adde to the scripture and to fall under condemnation from that scripture and from that text too as adders to the scripture to hold forth preach publish in the movings of the spirit and therein also to commit to writing the holy truths revealed in the light and spirit of god they obey and walk in and to call men by voice scripture or writing as they are moved to live and beleeve in the light to walk not after flesh but the holy spirit of god in them which reproves them of sin and lusts against their flesh as they did of old who wrote in the same light and spirit of god that outward scripture ye more scrible for then walk by so long as ye walk not by the light and spirit as it bids you doth not the scripture call to beleeve and walk in the light and spirit and not in the darkness and in the flesh and where is that spirit and light is it not within in the heart where the flesh and darkness dwells which lust against it and for as much as thou sayest here the spirit damns all wayes and means of knowing god and communion with him beside the scripture
thou elymas wilt thou not cease to pervert the right wayes of the lord doth not the scripture and spirit of god by it rather down rightly damn all them out of al communion with god let them jactitare joy and boast never so much of their having the scriptures that walk not in the said light the qua testifie to which thy self only contrarily both to the scriptures and sound reason and gods spirit also damnest down as diabolical to the pit of hell who yet sometimes again confessest it to be of god and gods voice in nature by which he reveals his minde to men and that infallibly without the least

contribution of strength or assistance from without and therefore surely without a letter ad exera
yea and rejectest with abhorrency and detestation ex
doth not the spirit by the scripture condemn them for lyars and such are all the formal professors of the letter that have got the good words to talk on for hire and make a trade of whose portion is the lake while they are not under the power of the light but hate it and the holders of it out that pretend to communion with god out of the light and own's it any other way or means of fellowship with god but the light saying iob
god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lye and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship together and the blood of his son cleanseth us from all sin dost not thou then instead of light walk in obscurity instead of brightness in darkness it self dost thou not grope for the wall yet like the blind as if thou hadst no eyes and stumble at as in the night is not a mist upon thee already from the hand of the lord so that thou seest not the sun as it was on the false prophet act

that sought to turn away the deputy from the faith and from beleeving in the doctrine of the lord which yet he could not do by all his mischievous subtilty and to pervert the right wayes of the lord

and now thou hast brought mee upon that text iob
tis true hee bids the saints not beleeve every spirit but try the spirits for many false spirits and prophets were then abroad and as christ said matth

there should in the last time come false prophets false christs antichrists even so witness iohn here and also iob
they did come and were even then already in the world and have multiplied since then into a number numberless and spawned themselves over the face of the whole europian earth and more so that all cities countries vniversities so called parishes through christendome are even overflowed therewith the more shame for them that cannot see wood for trees and how christ is now coming to consume the antichristian locusts of all sorts where they swarm with the spirit of his mouth and brightness of his coming in myriads of his saints iud
but rather dream they are now newly rising out of the bottomless pit so i.o ex


and so mistake the true prophets to be them who rather are armed with the light and standing up in the might and power of the lord against them but let me ask thee i.o what were they to try the spirits and the prophets by was it the letter or the light the scripture or the spirit of god it self which of these two is the rule or touchstone of trial which is the iudge that must give the resolution in whose sentence there must ultimately be a resting and undoubted discerning what spirit or prophet is of god and speaks truth and what is false and comes with cunningly devised fables know thou sayest
the scripture and that alone we are sent to in this case to give the determination but saving thy single say so there is no evidence of any such matter either in this text or any other tis not denied by me but the scriptures may bee searcht and that that which is of god contradicts not them so the bere did who are commended for receiving the word first as it was spoken readiness of minde and recorded as searching the scriptures also but that on the account of which they beleeved the doctrine before they lookt into the letter was the

light in their own hearts whereby then very conscience could witness it to be the truth it answering to that of god in them as face to face in a glass and not the letter without for being lookt on without the light and spirit of god it came from that gives to see into the mystery of it to say nothing here how the light and spirit within only gives to know the letter to be more of god then the iewish talmud or the turkish alcoran the scripture answering to the eternall unchangeable infallible light of god in the conscience then those fables do the letter would have further blinded them from all beleef of the truth as it did the old scribes and doth the new that search it in the darkness of their own understandings more then the bereans did the letter being but such a history record and writing of certain outward things transacted in a ceremonial or temporary figure and type of some spiritual inward substantial invisible and eternal truth as lookt upon by them that are not in some measure in that truth it self it in a figure calls to and is the type of benights the dark minds and prejudices them more against the truth then if they had no outward letter at all as the pillar of fire to israel that were on the inside thereof was a cloud and darkness to the egyptians that were on the backside which is the reason why all sorts of porers on the outside of the letter and backside of the bible and professors as well in separated assemblies as parochial of the letter in the carnal commandements thereof are further hardned in hatred against the qua the children of light who are let and lead by the spirit and light of him who only opens the seales to his disciples into the inside of it and into the power of the endless life yea more then very heathens that never heard of any letter at all for to such as read the letter any other way but in the light and spirit that gave it forth by holy men as animal men do and therefore discern it not it seems to contradict the things of the spirit whereupon the apostles were counted blasphemers of the truth because they called men into it out of the types and taught men to forsake moses testament that stood in outwards viz heb
eatings drinkings of flesh bread and wine and divers baptisms carnal ordinances outward or in the flesh which all had their institution and were in being before christ crucified who jure put an end to all these by the sacrifice of himself though de facto used after by permission for a time in regard of peoples weakness at first to bear the total leaving them off for indeed to the lookers for the kingdome and coming of christ in outward observations hee that seeks to bring them off from these which decrease to christ who increases that they may witness him formed and his image brought forth in them seems to such as paul did to the foolish bewitcht ones of the galatians that hung in the letter and stuck short of the spirit thinking to be made perfect by the letter and fleshly performances to bee a very enemy both to them and truth and then most when he tells them most of the truth
say then tis the spirit and light and not the letter by which doctrines spirits prophets true or false are to be tryed neither is the spirit of god which was before it so to stoop to the letter as to stand at the bar before the letter that is infer
it and came from it but both the letter and all false spirits and their speakings and it self and its own also to bee tried judged and determined by the spirit of god which judges all and is not to

be judged by any which as the light discovers discerns and comprehends the darkness but is not discovered discerned nor comprehended by it nor is this absurd as it may seem to some blinde ones to say the speakings writings doctrines things of gods spirit as well as all false spirits and the things thereof are to bee tried by the spirit of god it self for as the sun outward is that which shews both it self and all things and is not shewed by any thing but it self and rectum is ever mensura sui obliqui that which is infallibly right is the rule and measure of manifestation of it self and of all the wrong and not retro any wrong darke crooked doubtful or fallible thing the rule of that so the spirit and light of god by and from which and that but remotely too through mens hands the letter had at first and now through fallible mens hands hath all its being is the rule of trial for it self and of the letter and of all false spirits prophets doctrines yea it self and all things are made manifest by the light whether approveable or reprovable works of flesh or fruits of the spirit as the letter sayes of it gal

eph
yea what ever doth make manifest as the letter never doth or can without the light and the light doth often and did thousands of years without the letter and before it was it is the light and if any other should yet of all men i.o cannot charge this on me as an idem per idem to say by the spirit of god and the light alone we must try the true light and spirit and the false spirits and pretences to the names of light also for say no more in it then the truth of the true light and spirit which himself sayes most falsely of the letter when
he asserts it to be the rule and standard the touchstone of all speakings whatsoever that that must speak alone for itself which must try the speaking of all but it self yea its own also

i.os
argument to prove the scripture and nothing else the only most perfect rule and standard is this viz ea omnia quae examinari probari debent
all those things which ought to be examined and tried yea which we are commanded to try tanquam ad lydium lapidem as twere by some infallible touchstone by the scripture whether they are true and agreeable to divine verity or not with free liberty yea necessity of rejecting them if not consentaneous to scriptures those neither apart nor joyntly considered can be the rules or directories of gods worship our faith and obedience nor are upon their own account at all to be credited
but all revelations visions spirits dreams enthusiasms we are commanded so to try examine and prove therefore those are no rules that are of themselves to be credited

rep that argument the minor of which is most false and supposes that infallible spirit of god to bee now subjected as some underling to a fallible letter now transcribed by weak men is founded on this text iob
and two more only beside those above spoken to viz cor
and thess

the first of which know nor why i.o cites it it proving nothing to his purpose because paul there quotes a text out of the law or letter saying in the law its written with men of other tongues and lips will speak to this people i.e to the drunkards of ephraim yet they will not hear which first part hath not a tittle for him but the latter part of it much more against him then he is ware of being not wise enough well to weigh it and the second text with the two verses before viz quench not

the spirit despise not prophesyings prove all things rather against him that the spirit which is there mentioned and not the letter at all is that by which all things are to be proved
what is said above to that text in iohn shall as well it may stand as answer to the said sixth argument with this only addition that if we must go to the scripture for the trial of all spirits even gods as well as others then lets go no further at first however then that in hand which tells us that the true church who is written to in that verse wherein nor in any about it there's not the least hint about the letter had a secret taken whereby to know the spirit of truth and the spirit of errour
which the world and its priests and people have not vers every spirit quoth he that confesseth iesus christ to be come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not this is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard it should come and even now is already in the world
riddle me if it be within thy reach and from thence tell me which are the true which the false spirits which christs and gods which antichrists they that confess christ jesus to be come in the flesh as the or they that deny the saviour the anointed to be come in the flesh as from the pope to the least outside or nominal christian and meer literal beleiver and professor among the most reformed protestants save they who beleeve and live in the internal light and spirit with one accord all do

looking at talking of the history of expecting justification sanctification righteousness salvation all from christ only as he was made a man of flesh and blood without them

and if say in vindication of himself in this that that is the confession of jesus christ to be come in flesh which every spirit that makes is of god to beleeve the story of the incarnation life suffering death resurrection that is all truly related in the letter without as twas done in a figure of what was to be further and more spiritually and mystically transacted in his true body the church whereof he is the head with a confident application of him and of the benefit of all the righteousness he did in that person by every man to himself as by way of computation and imputation before he hath it indeed imparted or conveyed into himself for this is t.ds and the whole brood of the back side beleevers and the bastard christians saith and confession of christ to be come in the on the account of which they hope they are of god and shall be saved though they are far from witnessing or confessing the same christ who is the wisdome righteousness light power salvation and image of god to be begotten conceived formed born brought serth incarnated risen from the dead living and dwelling within themselves where he hath lyen slain as an innocent lamb from the foundation of the world in their hearts which therefore is to perish with the lust thereof which inward witness of the words incarnation and dwelling in themselves they that were of god of old had iob
the word was made flesh and dwels in us and we saw his glory and all now have who are of god and have not the vain hope of the hypocrite only which is as the giving up the ghost when god comes to take ay his soul job but that hope iob
which is an anchor to the soul and stedfast entring into that within the vail heb
which is christ himself in us the hope of glory col

known by them to be in all them who are not reprobates cor and still in that transgression and in that condemnation which hath past already upon them and is not now to them that are in christ walking no more after the flesh but after the spirit rom

say if i.o judge with t.d and others that that faith and confession ad extra only is the faith and confession of christs incarnation resurrection which proves them to be of god who have it and them to be antichristian spirits who have it not let him tell me whether there be any antichrists in christendome yea or nay have hitherto taken it that our divines say the antichrists properly are no where else and that there are many more antichrists then true christians naturâ non nomine in the world called christian but seriously know not where to finde them if i.os trial judgement and discerning of spirits by the very scriptures themselves bee not very dark and undiscerning and confused nor what spirits or prophets throughout all christendome are not of god since papists and protestants of all sorts prelatical presbyterian independent baptists seekers kanters and all other that know of as well as qua who only of all the rest witness that true inward saving good confession of the lord iesus with the mouth and beleeving in the heart that god raised him from the dead as feeling him living there within to which the promise of salvation is made rom
and which every spirit that witnessesh is of god joh
do together with the qua who own and deny not that as there bee some that falsely lay of them all confess and really beleeve the truth of the outward history of christs coming in the flesh of that person that was born at bethlem that lived and dyed and rose again at jerusalem according to the true relation of the outward scriptures and do also apply him and all his by that faith they have in the story of that person and in the person at a distance from them though never feeling the power of his light righteousness and holy life within themselves but wot whether i.o will own all these spirits prophets and professors to be cordial beleevers or all such confessors of that outward incarnation and resurrection of christ from the dead to be all of god or not and in a present state of salvation thereupon and not one of the outwardly beleeving spirits prophets priests and professors abovesaid whereof the most are very prophane false deceitful liars swearers couzeners cheaters drunkards riotous whoremongers idolaters covetous proud persecutors of christ every way abominable and unchristian in their lives few or none of which beleeve so much as that they must necessarily or can possibly be purged perfectly from their sins till they to be at all antichristian
if he say nay these all shall not be saved then the said outward faith in and confession of christ as without them is not saving if hee say yea then first where is his personal election what need any personal sanctification of us as to our salvation what was personally in that man only that dyed and rose at ierusalem is enough for us so that none needs reside in us let us eat and drink when we dye we shal be saved and live for ever

moreover what hath been said above may stand as a sufficient answer over the head of os fourth agument which as most of them are one with another in many matters in proof of which he cites over and over again

the same texts so that one cannot well make a full end with one argument without some transition into another is very much coincident with this
the summe of which fourth is this viz

if it be often commanded by god that we attend diligently to the scriptures left we be turned aside from the truth and right knowledge of himself by seducing spirits vain revelations false teachers then the scripture is the most perfect rule but the first true therefore the other ex
the texts that prove the minor of this argument quoth he are so clear and plain that ad solem caecutiat necesse est he must needs be blinde toward the sun it self who assents not to them in some of which also quoth he the certitude of the sacred word that is the scripture still with i.o is preferred before the certitude as to the churches use even of true revelations and miraculous
rep yet two of them viz tim

pet

many times a peece over repeated and supposed to supply almost every turn of i.o how they serve not his turn at all is abundantly above discovered whereupon here quit them
another is so much misquoted viz ioh
that as plain and clear as the sun as it is he must be better skill'd then that knows where to finde it at all
two more there are that make as much to i.os purpose as any two can do that speak contrary to it and those are ioh
thess

the words of the first which with those of
vers are christs to the scribes are these had ye beleeved moses yee would have beleeved me for he wrote of me but if ye beleeve not his writings how shall ye beleeve my words
christ by true revelations of it from the father to him truly revealed the fathers will to the scribes which they received not from him but hated him for ioh

saying of christ wee are none of his we are moses disciples we know god spake to moses as for this fellow we know not whence he is joh
christ tells them in effect that for all their prate and pretence to moses as their tutor he rather was their accuser in whom they trusted sith they in truth beleeved not moses for a minori ad majus did you indeed beleeve moses ye would much more beleeve me quoth he for he wrote of me he sent directed and pointed you to me for so he did deut
saying of christ a prophet will god raise to you him shall ye hear in all he sayes who hears him not shall be cut off from his people act

but if you beleeve not his writings wherein ye are bid to hear me as the greater of the two as the son in the house where he was but the servant then ye cannot beleeve my words
the summe in short is this hee that heeds moses writings must hear me for moses bids them do so he that beleeves what say doth what moses sayes he that beleeves either beleeves both he that beleeves not both beleeves neither

but what of that what follows hence this quoth for that is the very end hee infers this text for and the very conclusion he infers from it viz that moses writings of christ are more sure and of greater certainty as to the churches use then christs own words from his own mouth or then christs revelations of gods minds to men as revealed to him from the mouth of god from the very bosome of the father siccine itane is it so

indeed what the ouard remotely transcribed copies of the writings of the old servant that put a vail over his face too and spake so darkly in types and figures and shews and shadows that twas hard to behold stedfastly to what end he spake more plain and stedfast and sure and certain then the immediate voice words revelations of the son himself whom moses called to hear as coming and speaking more distinctly out of the very bosome of the father the dotage of our vniversity doctors the dimness of our divines who profess to dive daily and deeply into the scriptures that make the dark writings and dead letter and servant more clear and worthy and useful to the church then the express voice and words of the son which are spirit and life it self
shall set but one scripture to face this fancy of i.o and so leave and let it stand to the shame of it self and its father heb
vers to the
see and read it

thus of the first the words of the second are these be not soon shaken in minde nor troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of the lord is at hand
rep
the business i.o cites this in proof of is for this and that next before are of those that are subscribed to that purpose that the certainty of the scripture is preferred before the certainty of true revelations and miracles but which way so much can be drawn unless it be as i.o draws iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with cart ropes from that text is more then can tell
paul silas and timothy had told them it seems of the coming of the day of god both by spirit word and letter they whose great hope lay in the comming of that day like such as look and long for what they love and are apt to thinke and hope it to be as they would have it did hope it to be nearer hand then it was and fearing left finding it further off then they thought they might bee troubled and shaken in minde and failing in their faith of it he gives them to understand the worst of it that the best might the better help it self that they should not mistake them in their doctrine about that day as if they had said it was immediately to shine out upon them and so waver in their mindes flag in their faith and be troubled with doubts as if it would never come to them because not so soon as they wisht it might for there was a long night to interpose it self first he wills them withall to remember
that he told them no less in the spirit by word of his mouth as now he doth over again by letter or writing when was present with them howbeit as thats never long that comes at last so that day would come at last to their salvation and destruction of the man of sin who caused the night with the brightness of it here's the short and the long of the business of that verse and those about it from which who can see the sun can see no such doctrine follow as i.o dreamingly draws from it nor one dram of reason nor the least grain of assent to his assertion that the scripture is of more certitude as to the churches use then any true revelations

other arguments i.o urges why the light and spirit cannot bee the rule
therefore the scripture must be it
j.o
that to which we are never no where sent of god that we might learn the knowledge of himself and his will and take direction in our duty that cannot be the rule canon principle

or directory of our faith

learning knowledge and obedience

but we are never no wheresent of god to any inward light or internal private spirit
therefore les the fanaticks produce but one place of scripture wherein we or any are sent to their rules or directions of faith and obedience and we will not say but they have cause to triumph in earnest but if they speak of their own they are lyars they bear witness to themselves and their witness is not true

reply
as for thy word private spirit we deny all leading by any private light and spirit it is the common light and publick spirit of god which is one and the same in all though not in the same measure and not any thing of our own that we testifie to and profess to follow as our guide it is the gift of gods grace in us that appears to all bringing salvation which teaches all that are led by it and learn at it to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts and live godly righteously and soberly here that we intend nor do we so much as pretend to any other inwardlight but that of god in the conscience which though thou foolishly stile it natural yet thy self be such an ample testimony to sometimes that we need use no other then thy own words to prove it to be infallibly of god and from him an infallible guide and that we are sent of god to this inward light word or spirit in answer to thy challenge to produce one scripture say what need wee produce one thy own pen if thoul't beleeve it points out almost places yea all in which the word of god is said to be preacht publisht multiplied received where the word nigh in the heart is meant and the outward scripture that is the declaration of it considered formaliter or as written not at all intended yet for fear thou shouldest not beleeve thy own pen when such
truths drop from it as make against thee and indeed it hath let fall so many untruths pro and cons and fellaries from it that it little deserves to be beleeved by thy self but rather suspected when it writes the truth am free here to produce some out of many more that might bee produced wherein men are sent in the scripture if that be of god by whom thou they nunquam nusquam never no where are so sent to the rules and directions we call to which are not any mans own private spirit or fained light or enthusiasms or dreams as thou dreamest and to the abusing of us to the world out of thy own narrow private spirit divinest they are but the word light and spirit of god which is within viz jam
receive with meekness the ingrafted word able to save souls undefined span alphabet insitum
that the word is a light thou dost not deny and that its within sure thou wilt not who sayest ex thus that word within is the word of faith the apostles preached and that we are here called to it thou canst not
so gal
walk in the spirit of which spirit he saith

it lusteth against the flesh which lusting must be where the flesh that private earthly evil spirit that man in the fall is possest with lusteth against it to envy and all evil but that is within and the scripture saith so not only in iam
but in some other place whence he a leadgeth it whose words are think yee that the scripture faith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy so joh
let that abide in you
if that ye have heard from the beginning remain in you and whats that but the anointing the spirit of god within which though may call a whimsy and delusion a lye and such like yet is truth and is lye yea tis nothing but that which is in the lye which calls it a lye and that which is already deceived and hath nought but deceit it self to bee deceived of that cryes out deceit and delusion of the truth

to which might adde all such places as call to the light and mention the light as that which though evil ones hate yet such as truth come to and christ both warned men himself to walk by and beleeve in and sent paul and iohn and therest of ministers to turn men to

and iohn the baptist pointed at and witness'd to which light was not the letter in which they wrote of this light as thou supposest for they were not of that cor
but the light of christ and christ the light of the world who enlightened every man before the letter was and that is within in the minde and conscience where the darkness is for the darkness is within and not without and therefore the light must bee much more within which shines within the darkness though not comprehended by it for that light which shines in the dark place till the day dawn and the arise there which is the heart must be also in the heart and that light which shineth within the darkness which is within men must needs be much more within them as the candle that shines within a dark lanthern that is seated within a room must need be within the room as much if not more inwardly then the is

another argument against the light and spirits being the rule and so consequently that the scripture onely is it is the uncertainty of all sorts of enthusiasms

that which is every way uncertain yea most uncertain deceitful whether we consider principle of the revelation or the things revealed that we ought not to attend to as a rule or guide in the way of life and the worship of god but that's the nature of all enthusiasmes

therefore

reply
is thy text then such a certain rule with thee which thy self confessest to bee so uncertain that criticks may alter it as they please and about which thou confessest ye are in such a heap of uncertainties


wee talk not of enthusiasms as the rule but of the light within and spirit of god in the conscience and word in the heart manifesting good and evill lusting against the flesh which the letter calls a light to the feet a lamp to the paths and this as is above shewed from pet

is a sure word of prophes yea this is most certain unchangeable eternally the same incorruptible living and abiding ever what ever become of the dead letter that is so liable to be altered corrupted nullified that there need no other argument in the world be used to prove it not to be the word of god unless god have an uncertain and corruptible word which blasphemous

and contrary to the scripture to imagine then the utter uncertainty and corruptibility of it insomuch that we may safely syllogize thy own argument against the inward lights being a rule from its uncertainty back again upon thee against the letters being a rule ab omne genus incertitudine from its uncertainty and corruptibility thus viz quod omni modo est incertum incertissimum corruptibile

that which is every way uncertain most uncertain liable to be altered falsified corrupted to be wrested this way and that to moulder away to perish be torn to peeces burned and many wayes brought to nothing is not the word of god nor the only rule
but the letter or scripture is so as abovesaid witness the written role of ieremiahs prophesie which zedekiah cut with a and consumed in the fire and thy own confessed mouldring away of the very first manuscripts therefore
another argumen of i.o against the light and spirits being the onely rule is this
j.o its of no small moment that leaning to these principles following guides rejecting the rule of the word written the fanaticks are daily driven to pernicious manners abominable idolatries murders whoredomes blasphemies and in all nations to unhappy ends
rep whether there be more abominable idolatries murders whoredoms blasphemies and pernicious manners among qua or other men called christians and christian ministers that suck at the breasts of the vniversities or nursing mothers is sufficiently shew'd above as for unhappy ends tis by bloody persecution many fanaticks as thou callest the qua have come to untimely deaths the more shame for new england where two of them have been hanged for coming into their coasts and old england also where for all the pretences to reformation many have perished in prisons and by blows and bruises for their testimony to the truth the more shame for oxford it self too where one of the first that came thither dyed of the bruises and abuses there received from the scholars but if by unhappy ends thou mean such as befall men as his judgements from the hand of god immediately in some eminent notable way seizing on them and cutting them off these are untimely ends that many not for following but forsaking and fighting against the light the qua testifie to have brought on themselves in these latter years in these nations besides many sharp sufferings in their lives time in which thy self i.o hast had a just share for flinging at the qua as fanaticks who art now flouted at as a fanatick thy self beware therefore and be warned in thy le thy latter end be as some of theirs how scores at least of persons have been taken away for their hands being heavy on the qua by the hand of god heavy on themselves is to be seen in a book of e.b stiled a word of reproof where hee mentions about fifty sad examples of gods vengeance on the qua enemies where dean owen is also marked out for no great good but his excessive pride to which refer thee and to this very day the righteous god every morning brings his righteous iudgements to light but the unjust knows no shame

another argument whereby i.o would prove the scripture to be the word of god is on this wise


it will easily appear to any one that never so sleightly reads it that the holy scripture is by the holy spirit very often indigitated by that name

so
in every place it avers it self to be the word of god
so
if the scripture be what it reveals and declares it sef to be it is then unquestionably the word of the living god for that is prosesseth of it self from the beginning to the ending

which is nothing at all to such a purpose for its the commandements written which were gods commands before they were written and we to be the word of god whether they be written or not that are there spoken of under that term word of god and not the writing or scripture of the commandements


exer
thou overturnest thy self clear as to thy minor saying thus

where the word of god is said to be preached published multiplied received in innumerable places almost the scripture formally considered is not meant nor intended which is so though know thou contradictest this again blaming the qua because they allow not the scripture to bee meant in those innumerable places of scripture where the word of god is said to bee preached published and received ex then how canst thou say the spirit in the scripture calls the scripture from one end of it to the other calls the scripture the word of god and that the scripture every where calls it self so

another argument whereby thou wouldest evince the scripture to bee the word of life and so the rule is a certain absolute necessity vel ad esse to the spiritual being of the saints that thou fanciest to be in the scripture saying ex

non vict vitam haeanimatem traducamus quam cognitio
dei atque side in dies udiamur
we have not more need of food to the natural life then of the scriptures to the knowledge of god and th and that its evident that the qua have with less danger and loss assayed to fast forty dayes then they can lead a spiritual life free from deadly sins without the word of god

rep without the word of god grant it but the word still is in the heart and is not the scripture formally or lieer without which thou with shame enough due if thou takest it to thy self sayest men cannot live spiritually without nor free from sin without as if there were no holy spiritual men that did no iniquity as the world doth or that were free from deadly sins before the letter was what letter had abel enoch noah righteous and upright men that walked with god in crooked generations to live by and if they lived without the letter to god is it as impossible to do so now as to live bodily without food that which is necessary ad esse and not bene esse only must be necessary for them as well as us and so the word of god is which was before the letter and which they then had who had not the scripture yea both

outwardly inwardly men live by the word that proceeds out of gods mouth else outward bread doth not keep men alive bodily matth

yea every creature that man lives by must be sanctified by that else its a curse tim

and for the qua fasting forty dayes without hazard theres a miracle told by i.o himself concerning the qua if that may convince such as look for miracles yet will not men beleeve


more texts there are used and quoted often over and over again in proof of many particulars respectively about the text or scripture not one of which either of them truly serves one jot toward the proving of as namely that it is the word of god and that so assuredly that who receive not as so are inexcusable in damnable unbeleef that that is asserted to bee the rule and standard the touchstone of all speakings whatsoever that which pleads its reception not onely in comparison with but in opposition to all other wayes of coming to the knowledge of gods minds and will the best and most effectual means of bringing men to repentance that which all faith and repentance is immediately to be grounded upon by which god gives us greater security against all and pleas of unbeleef to the excluding of them and to the enforcing of beleef as a sure foundation for faith to repose it self upon and more moving then any evident miracle that true voice of god which assertains the soul beyond all possibility of mistake that which not only it self to be discerned from al delusions but determines al doctrines also propos'd to be beleeved whether they be truths of god or cunningly devised fables more then the most signal miracles imaginable more then that greatest of miracles even christs resurrection and mans rising with him from the dead more then any voice from heaven it self not only then one counterfeited by men or satan in the air but then any true voice of god himself speaking to us from heaven as he spake to or as he spake to christ yea as safely to be rested in as such any voice coming from heaven with such divine power as to evidence it self be of god and to be rested in as such yea giving greater certainty and security then that voice which came to them in the holy mouns that moses and the prophets which who hears not not be perswaded to repent though one arise to them from the dead that which as to its certitude is preferr'd before the certitude of even true and miraculous revelations that beside after the compleating its canon no new revelations about the same faith and worship are to be expected or admitted no more it as from the spirit to bee added which is to stand alone as the only most perfe
rule inalterable standard for the trial of all doctrines visions revelation spirits gods own not excepted to which we must stand come and are sent alone to stick stedfast and earnestly attend to without hearing or heeding angel or spirit without listning to any new blowings or inspirations of the spirit which is now imited to the letter though it was once at liberty and had the licence as well since the letter was written as before to blow where it listed ioh

but that of the scriptures on pain of rejection and heavy damnation from god own spirit in the scripture in a word that law and testimony which alone is to be consulted with in all doubtful cases to which god calls from our seeking and attending pythonibus aut aryolis qui pipiunt qui mussitant to wizards and familiar spirits that peep and that mutter yea

that very word there spoken of isa
which whoever speaks not according to these is no light to him

say the two texts abovesaid are not only frequently cited and recited in evidence of these various and sundry particulars but also judged by j.o to be such sure grounds hercules pillars firm props and principles as are not only satisfactory to mens consciences but sufficient to stand that way he draws them against all mens objections so that relying thereon men have a sure bottome and foundation for their receiving all the other scriptures so assuredly as the word of god and consequently all that that it abovesaid that who even from thence even from these text own them not in that manner as such are left inexcusable in their
that therefore the utter in of j.os deductions from them which are meer non sequis may the more plainly appear shall letting fall j.os other trifling arguments and sidling replies to what the qua urge on behalf of the light of inartificial arguments as himself calls them draw them into the form of artificial ones and express the manner of his illegal inferences from them which is in such as here under follows
we are by that text in isa
sent to the law and to the testimony to try what churches or persons speak about the things of god his will worship or our obedience to him who if they speak not according to that word there is no light in them
therefore tis evident that the scriptures are the word of god and consequently all that that is abovesaid
the second viz christ luke
bids men attend not looking for miracles to moses and the prophets the written word as the best and most effectual means to bring to repentance and which all faith and repentance is immediately grounded upon
therefore the scriptures are evidently the word of god

rep
in which two arguments thou reasonest in print well nigh as ridiculously as he works in paint who doth

humano capiti cervicem jungere equinam

for the head of the corner is strait sound and sure the body of the building upon it corrupt and crooked weak and rotten

that we are sent to the law and testimony to that word there talkt of and intended and to moses and the prophets and that that law testimony and word that moses and the prophets spake of in those two texts is that word that is the true touchstone of all truth a greater ground for faith and repentance to be founded on then that of miracles and a more sure stable firm fixt stedfast or standing word then the voice which came from heaven all this do not in the least deny but that the bare outward writing which thou falsely callest the written word and the external undefined span alphabet as at first written much more the present transcribed copies of that letter much more yet every letter tittle and iota of it which thou keepest such a tatling for to be no less then the word of the living god is that law testimony moses and the prophets or written word as thou callest it intended in those two texts or that by these termes in those two places is meant the said outward scriptures and lastly most of all that it follows by any good consequence

from those two places by such sound deduction as will stand against all objections gives such assurance thereof that he is a damnable unbeleever that not from thence that the said letter and letters are infallibly known to bee the word of god and the rest above said which are the things by thee inferred from them all this both do and dare deny

for the law that in isaiah is spoken of is not the literal copy nor outward legible letter that thou pleadest for and divinest it is but another law which see by thee thou art not yet very much ver'st in nor used to read even that in the heart not the undefined span alphabet or letter of a law of carnal commandements not the formal letter or literal form of a writing without but an inwardly written spiritual law or light within which is the power of the endless life that law in mens mindes which is warred against by that law of sin and death that dwells in their members the law in the spirit lusting against that and lusted against by that flesh or evil spirit that is also in men lusting unto envy and all evill the law of the spirit of life which is by christ iesus that is powerful to that which the letter or copy thereof which is figuratively called the law is weak to cannot do viz to deliver such as take heed thereunto from that law of sin aforesaid that leads men captive unto death the commandement that is a lamp and not a dark lanthorn
the law that is the light it self that leads to the life it self for so that of the spirit doth and not the dead letter that is used instrumentally as a knife to kill but in any wise cannot quicken
and that testimony or witness is that testimony of iesus which they have hear that keep the commandements of god even the light in the conscience as aforesaid this testimony of iesus who is the true and faithful witness of god of whom also god himself testifieth and beareth witness is jesus his own witness or testimony for god born by his own voice and writing by his own spirit and light immediately in the heart who there testifyeth what he hath seen and heard of the father though few such a thou art receive not his testimony whose light voice spirit speakings and counsel from heaven in their own hearts who so turns away from and hears not in all things is none of his sheep but shall be condemned and cut off from among his people and not the testimony or witness of men in outward writings or letters testifying though as moved by him what they have seen and heard from him not that scripture thou so for and callest the witness of god for that of god is far greater the testimony of iesus is a letter indeed a writing and an epistle prophesie yet not the outward writings letter and copies of the epistles and prophesies of peter paul and the holy men of old wherein is written and transcribed their witness or testimony for iesus which they were moved by his holy spirit to give out and hold forth whether by word of mouth or writing but the epistle of christ written not with inke but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart yea the testimony of jesus is no less than the spirit of prophesie it self rev
and not the writing thou so writest for in which men do but write it and write of it as is shewed above

this verbum lumen internum the word and light within is that which those that reject it are in that place of iob
hinted at by thee called undefined span alphabet lights rebels men resisting the authority which they cannot

but be convinced of and not the present letter or letters of the scripture as thou dotest
before the writing of one letter or tittle of which outward letter this inward light was though he that lives not by the light lives not by the letter neither which came from it and excepting where men have sould it with the dirt of their and agrees with it wonder how much of that scripture thou so adorest and wouldest have the preheminence in prating for it was written when that in iob was against which men could be said to rebel tell me if thou canst and in so doing thou perhaps tell thy self that that was a light within and not a letter without which they then were said to rebel against which letter without as much as thou seemest to wonder at the qua for holding the light within in authority equal to it they are not ashamed to set the light above and to say that it is non ejusdem authoritatis cum scriptura sea majoris authoritatis quam scriptura

not in as much but in more authority then the scripture neither will all thy scrape adde so many cubits to the statute of it as among any but such stocks as stick at nothing but without streining swallow all down for truth that thou tellst them is so to state it in any equality with the light it came from

and that the word we are sent to in isa
is the living word and not the dead letter nor mens dead senses thereon interpreting it according to their own private familiar spirits muttering out their own meanings and imposing on people their own cloudy cogitations thereon as cogent canons is evident for he calls them off from the dead to the living when they say unto you seek to them that have familiar spirits and wizards that peep and mutter should not a people seek to their god for the living to the dead to the law to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because the morning light is not to him undefined span alphabet so its more truly rendred then thus there's no lightin them which many not knowing the hebrew and many knowing it not heeding make no little ado against the lights being in all men and to as little purpose for its no light to him and not no light in him and we know a light may be in a room under a bushel and so not shine out unto it

and that by moses and the prophets to which christ directs as the most effectual means of bringing men to repentance and that all faith and repentance is immediately to be grounded on is not meant their meer outward writing it evident for all men that need repentance have not that yea if the scripture it and that alone be that men are sent to by which the doctrines to beleeved must be tried whether they be truths of god or fables and upon which all faith and repentance must be grounded what must become of those twenties to one in the world to whom god never vouchsafed so much as a sight of those their writings if thy divination from hence i.o be as true as tis sure enough to some its but a dream one of these things must be true as concerning such viz either
they need no faith nor repentance as they do or
they must be accepted with god and saved without either faith or repentance as they cannot or
both beleeve and repent without any ground at all for the doing of either and so build a castle in the aire without any foundation or bottome which how impossible it is or how well it would stand if it were possible so to build it an idiot may imagine or perish and be damned for ever by and from the living god

for not doing that which they had never any ground at all given them from god whereupon to do it and so absit blasphemia be cursed for ever for not acting what they were never put into any capacity to act and absit tibi domine ne tale quippiam facias exercendo pharonis tyrannidem absit tibi an non iudex totiusterrae exerceresjus be sorely beaten for not making as great a tale of brick without any straw at all as would have been expected from them if they had had straw enough and be punisht for not effecting impossibilities
but thy faith about that scripture being but the festisious fruit of thy own fancy and thy divination from it but the divinity of a divine that dreameth we need not in the dark iun upon any of these ragged rocks having a more sure way then any of these in the light made so plain before us that unless we chuse so to do as some do we cannot split our selves upon them for as all men having sinned need faith and repentance so they have a more effectual means of bringing them to repentance and a more immediate ground to build their faith and repentance on then the naked outward writings of moses and the prophets which thou here makest the ground of all faith and repentance not mentioning the apostles as if thou hadst forgot them whose writings thou makest a joynt peece of the foundation in other places
or then the meer outward writings of the apostles either together with them and that ground is no other but the which the writings of all these bear one joint testimony unto viz the measure of gods grace in every ones heart that teacheth to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts such as will learn of it and io live soberly justly and godly in this present world appearing to all men to that end bringing salvation along with it to such as submit to be taught by it tit

which such as thou art despise to their own ruine not knowing its given to lead to repentance the law light doctrine truth spirit word writing and testimony of god himself in the heart and conscience given out of his own mouth written with his own finger therein not consenting to any but condemning all evil and calling to repentance all other good reaching men even good lesson quod sibine vis fieri alteri ne feceris contra whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you the same do you unto them and this is that law and the prophets that moses and the prophets which christ ever sends to matth

and they that heed beleeve in and walk according to this whereby they are a law to themselves though heathen shall come to the life of god it leads to sooner then the letterlanding jew or christian that boasts of the letter yet through breaking it in the morals of it dishonours god
yea such are the true beleevers unto life as beleeve in that and they unbeleevers who beleeve the history of the letter despise this and thus it oft falls out that even ethnici non credendo credunt when christiani credendo non credunt and he that will not hear this moses and the prophets that so nigh him that is within him will never be profited or perswaded by any mans writings nor any preachings that are further off him and without him though one do arise to him from the dead
and this even this very thing viz your vilifying undervaluing hating resisting smoothering turning from not coming to that light of christ in your consciences but closing your eies against it stopping your ears at the voice of christ who from heaven speaks to you by it hardening your hearts striving like

the old and in heart and ears uncircumcised jew against the strivings of the spirit of god in you by it which by it convinceth the whole world both of sin and of righteousness and of judgement your receiving the grace of god in vain even the light that will not let you run to ruine without check reproof and controle which is that mercy that shews his to and that he is not willing any should perish but that all should come to repentance and be saved in the acknowledgement of the truth and your turning it into wantonness also your despising the riches of this grace of god the light in your taunting terms of know not what imagined christ or figment of the qua
know not what word or light within an infallible doctor know not what god or undefined span alphabet horn of plentiful salvation better then any god every thing nothing and the riches also of his long suffering and forbearnce towards you in your deep defiance and derisory deifiance of his light and grace not knowing that this goodness of god who gives you and others this is that grand ground that true moses and the prophets and not thy differently transcribed copies of their outward writings which are long since worn out and worm eaten and could not by thy own confession continue to this day uncorrupted and from mouldring without a miracle that should least you to repentance and is the most effectual means of bringing men thereunto and the firmest foundation and practice for all faith but such as yours which is false and fallible to fasten it self upon say this very thing and sin of yours in setting so light by the light of god is the great if not the sole reason why faith and repentance that are so much preached are so little practised so abundantly called for in a form and found of words yet little or nothing but infidelity impenitency and iniquity diminished into the name of infirmity to be found abounding as well among the most professing as among the most prophane preachers and their respective peoples who all continue in the same sins that both the scriptures and themselves too cry out against ad ravim usque sudorem to very heat and hoarsness sacerdotibus pluteum caedentibus sedentibus in plureis fudantibus laboring and laying on till ye preachers sweat in your pulpits and people in their pews against pride and fantasticalness in apparel against foolish talking and jesting and idle words in your speeches against unsavoury laughter and merry tales and such like frothiness in your communications against vain thoughts lust luxury rioting drunkenness chambering wantonness voluptuosness covetousness greediness of gain couzening chearing defrauding overreaething in bargaining buying and selling against all unrighteous dealing headiness fierceness anger passion impatience discontent backbiting whispering slandering hatred malice contention suing at law strife envying quarrelling rayling reviling against preaching for hire divining for money against biting and crying peace and preparing war against such as put not into your mouths against spoiling of mens goods persecuting and imprisoning their persons for their conscience sakes cum multis aliis quae nunc and yet more or less from the least to the greatest prophets priests princes preachers prayers professors people of all forms living stil for all this because unturn'd to that light which would shew every one of you his shameful sinful self without much condemnation for or repentance

from these evills some in one of them some in another all in some one or other and every one in his own that likes him best and beleeving it will be spared and be excused it live in him or he in it even till hee dyes so that the best of the parish are yet but as the beasts that perish being all lovers of pleasures more then lovers of god having all this while a form of godliness but denying the power thereof for which therefore having as eye witnesses born and in this nation well nigh finisht their testimony against you that ye may remember ye were warned in time and be excuseless and speechless when god himself comes as a swise witness against you for your adulteries against him and comes nigh unto you even in your own consciences unto judgement christ own disciples gods own hidden ones who suffer from you for it are now utter'y and eternally turning from you

and as there is no thriving in any thing but an empty outside profession of truth without the possession of it and no profiting appears in ought but the prophanenes aforesaid among the vain teachers and vain talkers of these times i.e the doctors and their disciples whose religion runs all up into straw and brings forth no fruit to perfection because they are all out of that light which is in them preaching and hearing one another preach the good words they have stollen out of moses the prophets and apostles writings but not heeding the law and the prophets and the light of the gospel within them god himself also according to what hee said of old blasting their ministry so that they cannot profit people at all and cursing all their blessings though they seldome send their hearers away without their blessed are all they that hear the word of god and keep it
so also there is nothing but what is worth nothing comes forth as most effectual a means as i.o faith the scriptures of moses and the prophets are to bring men to repentance by the hearing of moses and the prophets writings read one chapter yet of which dead letter of those living men grant is worth two of our dead divines dead divinings of old act

act

so now among iews and christians there are those that read these every first day but what's the issue of all the reading of their outward writings as all that comes up on the plowings and fowings of these when they preach is like that corn on the house top whereof the mower filleth not his arms nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosome so all that comes out upon the threshings and treadings of these oxen whose mouthes must not be muzled from feeding where they please if they do but read much more if they be at so much pains as to expound the scriptures is but an itching ear to know more then do yea a bare husk an empty hull an ear without grain a whole church full of chaff which every wind of doctrine drives up down and whisles to and fro which when winnowed and fified in time of temptation falls all back to the ground to the earth from whence it came which he whose fan is in his hand when he hath gathered his wheat into his garner will throughly his floor of blow upon by his spirit and burn up with unquenchable fire

thus moses is read and the prophets read and their writings heard which if i.o doth not divine a lye are the best and most effectual means of bringing men to repentance but where is the repentance hoped for are not the people ever in their sins is not that a vain power and meer fained efficacy

quae nunquam reduditur in actum is not that a most ineffectual most effectual means of repentance which never effects the end i.e the repentance it is the means of yet where is there one among all these painted penitents that so truly and fully repents from his sins as not to ive in and beleeve he must live in some dead works to his dying day or repents so far as to reach so much as hope that he shall live without sin till he dyes in which yet to go round again tis beleeved by the hearer because taught by his teacher that if he dye without repentance he shall finde no place after death for repentance though he seek it carefully with tears and that there is no purgatory in the world to come so here is plowing in hope and threshing in hope performing in hope and praying in hope preaching in hope and hearing in hope treading in hope and reading in hope not so much of godlines somtimes too as of earthly gain but what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained it is no better then the giving up of the ghost when god taketh away his soul job
and what is the reason of all this vain hope and and impenitency under this best means as i.o calls it i.e moses and the prophets writings is it for want of having the copies of their writings among them no transcriptions of the original of the hebrew and greek texts of sorts enough so many that they vary very much from each other and cannot stand together in some greater matters much less as talks in every tittle and iota in unity among themselves is it for want of rendring of these writings of moses and the prophets out of the hebrew copies into their own no the transcripions are not so many and various but the translations are as many more and more various not only in respect of that variety of the languages into which but also that more vast variety that is found in the translations of them into but one even our own english whereinto they stand translated so that he that is not in ove with such translations as cross his carnal interest and serve not his will and earthly turn may have his choice of any or many others that like him better is it for want of a competent number or quantity of bibles printed to serve the numberless number of people named christians in this nation no not so neither almost every one that can read and hath mony enough to buy one without which the word of god nor any other of his gifts are to be purchased if the simon magusses may have their wills who buy the patent for the selling thereof and yet sell but their own thoughts and words instead and under the name thereof will buy a bible what ever it cost to carry with him to his church and some will have two or three and most houses some and against the old word is worn out at the sellers shops there's enough of the word of god to be bought for money if the meer letter were it and a number of new bibles for all comers is it for want of hearing them read no they are read too much and heard read too often unless they were more spiritually understood and more carefully and practically observed is it for want of interpreters and interpretations expositors and expositions divines and their divinations what may be the minde of god in this and that place of it and what the drift and scope of the penmen in such and such sayings and their sense in such and such a sentence and the meaning of such a parable or proverbial speech and the like is it for want of men to give out their own judgements opinions and thoughts of

things and manifest their meer mindes about the matters therein contained no there's no need of this it can do no good for if it could the ocean of opinionists thinkers and thrusters out of their own thoughts of things doctors divines criticks scepticks schoolmen casuists commentators and such like diviners dreamers and deep divers after the marrow of that divinity in the scriptures that lyes deeper yet then their shallow can ever reach too who never yet got within the bones nor entred farther then into the outside of the sealed book and the letter or meer literal sense of the law and testimony that is bound up from all but christs disciples yet they whiffle it to and fro and weary the world out with the winds of their opinions which as they are as many more as the different translations are and more then the winds or points upon the compass by times twice told so they blow and strive against each other upon the face of the earth to the disquieting thereof as the sea is disquieted with their boysterous buslings filling it with the froth of their own wisdome which is foolishness with god foaming out their own folltes and fained senses upon the scriptures so fast and so flatly contrary one to another that as the most must needs be false so tis enough to confound and amaze mens minds they are so many to meddle to finde which is true among their meanings and to set a man out of his own senses to set himself so several are they to seek out their several senses on the scriptures many bumbling volumes larger then the bible it self being written or some one text of sripture
is it for want of power or efficacy in the letter yea that is one reason for howbeit i.o sayes it is absolutely called the power of god and effectual to salvation yet to his own confutation i.o sayes the letter is dead and without the spirit of no efficacy for the good of souls but another and that not the least is because they live in rebellion against the light which while they turn not to though moses is read and the prophets also and all the letter or old testament yet the vail remaineth over moses and the prophets faces and as over the iewes over the heart of these christians also which vail is done away only in christ and in turning to his light and the spirit within their minds are blinded being off from the light so that they know neither christ nor moses nor the voyces of the prophets that are so often read which through ignorance they fulfill as the iews did in condemning christ and putting him to open shame in his light doctrine and disciples
nevertheless if their heart shall yet turn to the lord that spirit and to his light which is within that vail shall be taken away and they shall see with open face behold the glory of god and be changed into his image be led indeed to that true repentance that is never to be repented of but if they continue in their unbeleef in the light and their hearturn not to the lord in and by the light in the time and space that is given them for that repentance yet at least the face of the covering that is now cast over all people and the vail that is yet spread over all nations shall be so far removed and destroyed at last that there shall be repentance enough to no purpose when it is too late when the gulph is once fixed and abraham is seen by these rich worldlings and bellygods afar or and lazarus in his bosome when every eye that look's for him shall see him who now cometh in the clouds and they also that have pierced him and all kindreds of the earth that are no kin to him shall wail because of him
even so

amen

neither any that can take them by the hand and lead them in the true way of eternall life of all the sons whom they have brought up at their vniversities who sit together with them under the shaddow of death notwithstanding all their

tumbling ore of so many tames about the scripture is it then for want of true prophets or undefined span alphabet men divinely inspired and sent of god to call people to repentance and to turn them to that light of god within that leads to repentance by voice and writing to them as them elves have had the true way thereof manifested in them by the light as themselves being taught of god have learned and practiced it and are moved of the holy spirit to preach and presse the practice of it upon others according to the scope of the scriptures no for there are many in england at this very day speaking reproving writing and from the same light and by the same spirit that the scriptures came forth from and as themselves have received and heard from the voice and mouth of god and seen felt and handled of the word of life as the prophets amos
and the messengers and ministers of god and christ of old act

neither deceive thy selfe so far i.o any more as to make and imagine it such an unwonted wonderfull impossible matter as in a manner thou dost that even in these dayes men and women too should as of old they were be moved and inspired both to speake and write by the holy spirit howbeit tis true there are times of gods going away and returning to his place withdrawing hiding himself his face in a little wrath for their forsakings of him from his own seed as it hath fell out for ages and generations together even
years at least wherein all the inward temple worship and worshippers therein lay wast and trodden down by the gentiles or nations that have had it given them so to do to glory in that name of christians without any true christianity and in literall formes and observations of externall ordinances according to the letter which they have not kept to neither but abominably corrupted themselves in the use thereof and made void by their own tradition without either of those two witnesses the word and spirit which have been much more then the letter abused and depressed into so low a condition as to speak low out of the ground and whisper out of the dust and bear their testimony fiting in sackcloth regarded and attended to but by a few to which yet god is now giving power again to open their mouths and to devour their enemies and to burn up all that hurt them and to smite the earth and the dwellers in it that rejoyce and make merry over them with all plagues as often as they will

yet thereis a time of his returning to his own again and of being found of them that seek him and of his appearing to all those that love and wait for his appearing to their joy though the shame of their adversaries and of bringing forth the blind that have eyes and the deaf that have eares and of opening the eye of the blind and unstopping the eare of the deaf and causing the waters to break out in the wildernesse and streams in the desert of pouring of floods upon the dry ground and making the thirsty land springs of water and of speaking himselfe not so sparingly as before and of pouring out his spirit on his sons nad daughters servants and handmaids that they shall prophesie and of revealing himself in visions and of the heavens dropping down their dew and of preparing

and though this seem such a mervailous matter i.o in thy eyes and utterly beyond that diminitive belief and that little faith thou hast which if we may believe thy self is for ought thou knowest just none at

and what testimony soever the spirit of god beaves of the scripture or of the word of god or of the gospel or of any anything else to us so as on pain of gods spleasure to bind us to the belief thereof it beares it in the hearts of men also as well as in the scripture though thou say falsly that all it now testifies it testifies in the scripture and by that onely to the heart and not in the heart immediately by it self or else it requires not the belief of it thou concludest thus viz
and if this be not a teme and foundation of faith and sure enough it is not so if the spirit speak not the same within that it doth without in the letter then publickly professe that for ought know have no faith at all he that doth not know that he hath any faith may thereby know assuredly that he hath not any
all yet must it therefore be such a mervailous thing in the eyes of god and of his people who are not so incredulous of the scripture as thou art that god should speak with his own mouth to his own people and vouchsase them so much mercy as to heare the joyfull sound of his his own voice and reveale his mind and will to them by his own spirit indeed sometimes he is pleased to speak in one to another as he did much in the prophets to the fathers in paul to the churches corin

now what meanest thou or what ground hast thou thus to forbid the spirit of the living god hath god prohibited him hath he any where limited himself from speaking immediately to the councel guidance comfort assistance of his people in these latter dayes especially without book any more than in former ages before the letter was and in the first age wherein the gospel began to flourish if men had not sneapt it and the glorious light thereof to shine out as the sun in its brightnesse but that the devil and his imps besmoak'd the sun and aire whom in his just judgement god suffered so to do because men began to dote one upon another and to set up idols and images in their minds of good writings that were written for another end by the spirits motion histories letters epistles and instead of the law of the spirit of life and light which is by christ iesus to magnifie the outward letter and make it honourable which is but mens for god and to run a whoring after it from gods own witnesse even his light and spirit in the conscience must the spirit be bound now by thee to read his minde to men in a book of mens writing at first by his own guidance and of fallible mens mistanscribing from the hands one of another through so many ages or else he must be silent not manifest

his mind at all he must read his old sermons it seems but he must not preach new ones he may read in the letter what he did reveale but must come forth in no new revelations now of the old thing nor preach immediately in mens minds any more as he had done from the beginning of the world to that time and inspired immediately whom he pleased is not this to muzle him up as the were wont to doe the parish curates lest too much truth should come forth and as they do where the pope hath most to do at this day so that they may read not too much scripture neither for therein confesse the case is a little altered for the better in england but old mouldy
mass books and forms of service in latine of their own setting out in which there is here a little and there a little sprinkling of some scriptures mostly out of the psalms which they most corrupt and make certain sing songs out of or if there be any homilies read its a mighty matter but as those the friars make are worth little and some of them worse then naught so as bad as they be there is few sermons to be heard throughout the popedome and as they allow men to read writings of their own setting out but not preach nor speak in any other order method manner or form of words then as they find there so thou wilt allow the spirit to speak to men in and by that letter he caused once to be written he may read his mind in mens hearts by that or have it read by mens mouths one to another if he will but no preaching now by himself within or by his immediate inspiration by men without nor writing neither but it must come to the touchstone of what he bade paul peter or others to write before which whoso shall presume to say it is of god or from god immediatly at all though it do agree never so much with that as all that is of god and from him doth and cursed be he that speaks contrary to what was of old written rightly understood or shall say tis truth before our tryers have tryed it by that who understand it not themselves much lesse are fit to try doctrines by it let him be dealt with according to the foresaid provision against delusion made of old in the night time while men slept in that behalf

but is god and christ and the spirit so sparing towards his people and so niggardly in dispensing truth in revealing his righteousnesse which he is now bringing neere and in shewing his salvation which now is not to tarry to them that long for it and have long lookt for it according to his promise as those narrow headed niggardly hearted nothings and novices are whose work is all along as dumb as they are from opening their mouths otherwise to bark and bite them back again that having left off to linger any longer at their lips and as well to feed from their mouthes as to feed or put into them make more hast then they would have them from the depths of hell and darknesse towards heaven gods high and holy hill nay verily he sayes to his servants open thy mouth wide and will fill it and stands ready to make good that blessing he hath pronounced to such as hunger and thirst after righteousnesse viz that they shall be from himself who only reveales it no lesse then filled with it thus liberal the lord and his spirit is

yet these are the doings of the churle whose instruments are evil and of the vile person who would fain be lookt upon as liberall too as he hath

been by such as saw him not in darker times nor discerned how he fed himself and not the flock and minded his own matters even to make meat for his own belly of them more then to make meat enough for the sheep in that dark and cloudy day ezek
but the hour cometh and now is wherein a man even a shepheard whom he knows not shall reign in righteousnesse and be as rivers of waters in a dry place and as the shadow of a great rock in a land wherein the deaf shall hear the words of the book which are sealed from the admirer the eyes of the blinde shall see out of obscurity and out of darknesse the eyes of such as seeing will see shall be no more so dimme as they have been and the eares of such as hear must hearken unto him the heart also of the rash or hasty that without heed have run they know not whether shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers be ready to speak plainly they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmured shall learne doctrine

then the vile person shall no more be called liberall nor the churle said to be bountiful for the vile person will work villany and his heart will work iniquity to practise hypocrisie and to utter errour against the lord to make empty the soul of the hungry and to cause the drink of the thirsty to faile the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poore with lying words even when the needy steaketh right things but the liberall deviseth liberall things and by liberall things shall he stand in that day the burden of the insolent antichristian assyrian that hath so straightly besieged the people of god that dwell in sion and cut off from them so far as god would suffer him)· he stay the staft the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water shall remove from off sions shoulders and his yoke from off her neck yea that yoke shall be destroyed because of the anoynting isa
for the spirit shall be poured out upon them that wait for it from on high and the liberall soul shall be made and he that watereth shall be watered also himself and the wildernesse shall be a fruitfull field in which judgement and righteousnesse shall remain and the works of righteousnesse shall be peace and the effect of righteousnesse quietnesse and assurance for ever and they shall be blessed that sow beside all waters and the soul of the diligent shall thrive and be fat but the soul of the vile person and niggard and of the sluggard shall desire but have nothing yea their vintage shall faile and their gathering shall not come and their fruitful field shall be turned into a forrest they shall be stript and made bare and sit with sackcloth on their loins and lament for the tears for the pleasant fields and the fruitfull vine and their pallaces shall be forsaken their tents and towers shall be for and that which now is the pasture of wild asses iob

wherefore then thou with restriction of the spirits guidance to those first generations thus viz
while the infallible spirit continued his extraordinary guidance and thus viz guided therein by the infallible direction of the spirit of god and by way of exclusion of and more expresly of this age thus viz
they were born acted carried out by the holy ghost to speake deliver and write and suppose a man were undefined span alphabet
inspired of god and should professe himself so and were so indeed as the prophes of old am
let me expostulate the case with

thee a little about these expressions whereby thou seemest to shut all the past primitive times from any participation of the movings and actings of the spirit as those that have neither part nor portion in that matter of his infallible guidance and direction

first then not denying what christ himself foretold iohn
iohn
viz
that he would go away for a while and his disciples should not see him and the prince of this world which hath nothing in him should come and interpose himself to the great interception of that primitive communion the saints then had with him and his spirit so that he would not have very much talk with them thereafter let me ask thee this much did he say he would leave them for ever and never have any talk or words with them more then what they should find of his written in the scriptures of such as should write some few things and a little of that much which they knew of his minde did he say he should not speake at all not so much as by his spirt nay rather did he not say that so soon as his fleshly pretence was withdrawn he would send the holy spirit himselfe the comforter to supply the room of that personall and bodily appearance wherein he then stood among them which they were so in love with and so loath to part with that they were ready to dote so upon it as to let sorrow fill their hearts to think they should be utterly without his tuition as sheep without a shepherd if that should vanish and be removed in the departure and absence of which notwithstanding he told them it would be never the worse but much the better and more expedient for them for if goe away saith he the comforter cannot come but if go will send him unto you which comforter was himselfe in spirit the presence of which in the heart gives nearer acquaintance and fellowship with christ and the father then his abode among them their sight of him in the flesh could possibly do

for the sight of him in the flesh the world may have and had which is to little effect if the other be wanting but his presence in the spirit is that which is of power and efficacy though yet in two different wayes viz of bare conviction or condemnation to the one and refreshment and consolation to the other both to the world and to the saints though there be no sight of him as in the flesh any more by either will send the holy spirit the comforter to you saith he and he shall convince or reprove the world also doth christ therefore say he will leave them comfortlesse i.e orphans iohn
deprived utterly of his presence because he said he i.e in flesh would go away nay saith he will come to you i.e in spirit

the spirit of truth which dwelleth in you and shall be in you and though the world seeth me no more when am gone because though the spirit of truth be sent into them and is nigh to men even striving preaching reproving in them

yet they recieve him not neither see him nor know him yet ye see me and because live ye shall live also and doth he not say that this spirit of truth should lead and guide them into all truth and bring all things to their remembrance whatever he while he was seen in the flesh which the letter doth not for there were many more things that iesus spake and did that are not written there so many that if they should be written every one it might be supposed the world could not contain what should be written john

and howbeit he intimates a more sparing communion in spirit with his and church which would be permitted to come to passe by the coming in of the prince of this world wherein there should not be so much talk as there should be before and would be again after that gloomy day was once over wherein the manifestations of him though as infallible in that small measure wherein they should be made for gradus non variant naturam rei yet as to the measure would not be so great as at other times of which going away and withdrawing even in the spirit also he seemes to speak when he saith a little while and ye shall not see me in which eclipse the chidren of the night must have a revelling night of rejoycing over the word and spirit and saints sitting in sackcloth and an hour of laughter and merriment at the power of its prevailing iohn to
yet doth he say that eclipse should be was there not some few in every age in whom the spirit bare a testimony and by whom to the blind world also of little truth and did he not say the spirit should be in them and abide with them i.e in the same manner of infallibility in manifestation of whatever he makes known though not in the same measure of manifestation of the truth even for ever iohn
and did he not say that the spirit of truth should testifie of him when he came and so consequently his testimony must be with his disciples and church for ever iohn
which testimony is not that of the letter which men wrote at his motion as thou falsely supposest for that is mans mediate testimony and not immediately the spirits any more then the testimony that men bear by word of mouth as they are moved of which in the very next verse iohn
christ calls their testimony and not the spirits and ye also shall beare witnesse saith he putting a difference between his disciples testimony by the spirit and that of the spirit by it self for that of the spirit is the word it self that is testified to by inspired men whether in writing or speaking and not the writing or the speaking it selfe
the word say put by the spirit into mens mindes and into their mouthes which word is promised to abide with his for ever and so saith many times over in his book repeating that scripture and putting almost the whole stresse of his ill cause upon it and bringing it in the folly and blindnesse of his minde to prove the letter by the promise of god himself of necessity to remaine inviolated inalterable and uncorrupted for ever whereas the spirit speaks it not of the letter at all but of the word which should be put into his peoples mouth isa
the word which put into thy mouth shall not depart from thy mouth nor the mouth of thy seeds seed from henceforth and for ever which strengthens what have now in hand to prove i.e the continuance of the spirits immediate movings of god people under the gospel more or lesse even for ever and doth not christ

also say mat to his disciples and in them to his church which is a successive body and not simultaneous nor appearing wholly in this world at nor altogether at one time lo am with you alwayes even to the end of the world and if there have been a time of more darknesse then ordinary even to his own by reason of christs absence and the devils presence in the world yet more or lesse to his own which are those that own him and heed his voice he hath ever appeared but however as his promise was to be with his more or lesse to the end so at the end his promise is to be by his spirit more with them then ever will saith he speaking of his returne after the mournfull time of his absence who is the bridegroom from the bride see you againe and your heart shall rejoyce as a woman when her houre of travel is over having no more remembrance of her sorrow because a man child is borne unto her and into the world and your joy shall no man take away so that in these dayes we may expect more then ever was enjoyed before the glory of the second temple being to be greater then that of the first which was trodden down more pourings out of the spirit then the primitive ages had these being the dayes wherein refreshment is to break forth from the face of the father wherein he will send act
to his church iesus his son who hath withdrawn and retired and been retained in the heavens till these times who so readeth this let him understand which are the times of the restitution of all things that ever haue been out of order and of his people since they ran astray from god which have been spoken of by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began

why then sayest thou while the infallible spirit continued his guidance as if after he should come he was to go suddenly quite away again of whom christ while present in flesh saith he was after his passing hence to come and to continue in and with his people mat
throughout all ages in all which ages he had people and a seed as in eliahs time rom
and a remnant though small and unseen rom
left trodden under foot by the outward israel that held the outward court which were as the sand of the sea for multitude even to the end iohn

what did the promise of christ fail to his own because of the worlds unbelief and did he leave them to be guided by the prince of this world that was to come and by his blind guides to guide and govern the world and have his kingdome in it a while and was his own seed which never consents to any iniquity but condemnes it given up by god because the seed of evil doers was to be guided by the spirit of the god of this world that totally blinded some from looking at the light and by the man of sinne and son of perdition to be strongly deluded to damnation by the mystery of his iniquity who was permitted indeed to withhold and hinder and let not a little till he should be taken away but after that wicked should be revealed in his time was not the lord to be revealed again in his time which is the principall and most proper and seasonable opportunity for christ to appeare in his spirit and shew himself in tim

undefined span alphabet in its proper times and was he not to conjure the other lying spirit with the spirit of his mouth which is not the letter that declares of the word but the living word it self which opens the letter also the sword of

his mouth put then into the mouth of his seed as aforesaid yea into the mouths of very babes to the stilling of the enemy and avenger and to destroy it with the brightnesse of his coming

what spirit was to take the guidance of his people if his own infallible spirit were not to continue with them for ever or would he deprive them of the presence of his infallible spirit in their hearts and place it without in the fallible letter so that if ever they would see or speak with his spirit they must look for him and hear what he testifieth there onely so talkes

and must go forth and talk with him there onely i.e without but not within he being gone forth from his dwelling in the hearts of his people now to dwell in the letter onely and minded there and no where else to be spoken with
and why sayest thou while the infallible spirit of god continued his guidance in an extraordinary manner and again


the infallible direction of the spirit of god hath god any other then that infallible spirit and if he meant to direct his people at all by his spirit in the dismal times that were to come must it it not be by that infallible spirit continuing his infallible which thou callest extraordinary guidance and direction or else by none at all or hath god two spirits to direct his own by at sundry times one extraordinary and infallible the other fallible and ordinary and hath that nfallible spirit of his two kinds of guidances and directions one extraordinary and infallible the other fallible and ordinary which extraordinary and infallible spirit and his extraordinary and fallible guidance was to continue with them but a while it being for high and holy and extraordinary dayes and times the ordinary and fallible for more ordinary and lower dayes and times as that the presence of which may as well serve the turn then and his people must be contented with it so making them like the popish priests and people of the world which have as at rome and elsewhere ordinary ornaments lessons anthems songs and services that must serve for every ordinary day and extraordinary shewes and and ornaments and number of candles and fine candlesticks plush canopyes and copes white surplices pictures pompes and pipings as on some great saints holyday or festivall times or general proecessions or as our poor still bepoped people have here one fine suit for sundayes and holidayes and a cheaper and lesse costly one for working dayes

or when this undefined span alphabet or divine guidance and inspiration is pleaded by thee as to those first times inquire of thee whether there be any middle way


but either that the saints in if guided by the guidance of the spirit of god at all and that thou darest not deny though thou own his guidance by the letter onely be guided by it as an infallible spirit giving them that infallible guidance which thou callest extraordinary or as a fallible spirit allowing them not so much as the saints of old but affording them onely some kind of ordinary or fallible guidance and direction for it remaines according to thy principles that it must be one of these or else there is some middle way some midling spirit of god and some middle sort of direction of that spirit that is neither fallible nor but between both partly partly infallible some participie that neither one nor the other but taking part of both fallibility

and infallibility and howbeit this is such a messe of mixture as may well make awise man and excuse him in it too believe him to be no wiser then he should be and to have hand plus quam cimex sanguinis that makes it yet know not why thou mayst not as well make god to have two spirits and his spirit two guidances viz one infallible one fallible or one absolutely infallible and another neither fallible nor infallible as thou makest god to have two words viz on that infallible living word which the fallible dead letter declares of the other that fallible dead letter which declares of that infallible living word for each of these thou makest the word god yea the depths of the doctors and divines of our times thou art not onely so exceeding expert in cutting and cobling dividing and botching and piecing and patching for thy own turne as when thou wilt to turn two into one and one into two but also so well vers'd and exactly taught in the point of trinitizing as to turne that one word of god at first into two and at last secundum quid into three for whether we examine what thou sayest of either the letter or the word it self this testimony thy book beares to them both
as to the word thou sayest in one place truly it's living


in another place thou sayest horresco referens more then dare say for the world whatever say of the letter that the word is dead

but falsely figured our with the figure of

as to the letter thou sayest in one place viz
ex

it is living and no where said to be dead

yet in the forcited falsely figured chapter
thou thy self as no where as the letter is said so to be sayest thy own self that the letter is dead thus gods one word is cut out by thee into two viz the letter and that word it witnesses of and then each of these are cut out into three for which ever of these two be that word of god or if thou taking these conjunctively wilt have them one at least thy opinion as exprest in those places put together is tantamount to no lesse then this viz that god hath
a living word
a dead word
a word that is both dead and living

and why sayest thou of the prophets and apostles they were borne acted carried out by the holy ghost to speake deliver write and suppose a man were undefined span alphabet inspired by the spirit indeed as if it were a matter now not to be expected in this age as if it were no lesse then a wonder but so the saints and prophets were in every generation to thy generation therefore wonder not that thou fo wonderest at it that any should now professe so to be though sapiens miratur nihil and the things of god are no where wondered at or evil spoken of but where ignorance of them is to see such a man as can truly say he is moved of the lord and inspired with his spirit whereas when was it otherwise in any age wherein god had saints and who is otherwise that is not in name onely but a saint or a christian indeed and truth was ever any otherwise or lesse then undefined span alphabet inspired of god that was born acted carried out by the spirit and was any otherwise or lesse then so that is moved guided led by that spirit to act speake write and ought any now any more then formerly or do any now that are truly saints act write speak think any

as micah stephen and the seven were and are not all christians bidden to be filled with the spirit and to let the word of christ dwell richly in them teaching ephesians
colossians and what such difference is there between being led by the spirit and guided by the spirit and is not he that is guided by it guided infallibly and every one that is led by it led infallibly and doth not every one that walks after it walk surely and infallibly and he that is enlightned by it enlightned infallibly and he that speaks sees writes acts by it as all saints should do though fallible in themselves do all this infallibly and is not he that is moved by it whether he obey its motions yea or no moved infallibly into that which is assuredly the truth and no lie yet i.o jeers at all pretence to any infallible guidance by the spirit of god in these dayes as fancy delusion far aricisme and at the spirit of god it self which the qua own as their truest teacher ironically under that term of the infallible doctor and t.d makes it matter of hainous crime in the qua to talk of infallibility in christs ministry now saying
pamp thus and as to the question of the infallibility of their ministry three iurates of sandwich will testifie that they did affirme their ministry to be infallible as if it were matter of amazement to him that men should mention such a matter as infallible guidance of christs ministry by his own infallible spirit in these dayes as if he gave it for granted to us who take him at his word for it is a truth that their own ministry is but fallible their guidance therein by no more then their own fallible spirits and may be utterly destitute of the spirit of god which is infallible for no fallible spirit hath god that know of
no marvell therefore to me that t.d so readily grants as himself sayes he does
of his
pamph
that none of his people can set to their seal that his ministry hath brought them to a perfect man
for know not how it should if it be a fallible one as he confesses tis while he denies any ministry now to be infallible and affirmes perfection itself too but so far as to be made free from sin to be not onely unattainable in this life but also to be no lesse then a doctrine of devils for any to preach it
see pamph

but whereas he sayes
the ministry was not intended for that end i.e

to bring to a perfect man or to perfect men in this life where they deny perfection attainable

rep reply that's false and expresly contradictory to eph
where its said the gospel ministry which obtains its end in this life or else is not perfect according to i.o and ceases in that to come is given for that end viz for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ how long till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ
and as for t.ds asserting the infallibility of the spirit to be an idiom a property of the spirit as incommunicable to the saints that partake of the spirit as omnisciency which agreed not to christ as man or omnipotency is

rep say that's meer as to the point in hand for we assert the saints and ministers of christ no farther infallible then they follow the leading of the spirit which is infallible out of which they are not in their ministry and so far as following that which is given to be all mens guide men and ministers whom we confess to be all fallible in themselves as abstract from that and not only liable to erre but erring actually as they leave off to be led by that and lean to their own understandings are all so far say infallible and infallibly guided for as god hath no fallible spirit so his infallible spirit hath no fallible guidance nor leads any fallibly at all but all infallibly who are led by it into all truth so as in all those things it teaches and are needful for them to know to make them otherwise fallible and ignorant thereof in themselves not only infallible but as to all thoe things say omniscient as himself is omniscient in all things absolutely without exception
neither are omnisciency and omnipotency themselves as to all those things that are to be known and done by such so altogether incommunicable to spiritual men as our academical animals imagine they are for though god christ and the spirit only know and can do all things absolutely yet through god christ and the spirit teaching leading guiding revealing enabling all things i.e all things that are truly good fit suitable comfortable profitable for such are both infallibly to be known and possible to be done by the ministers of god in their respective services and seasons whereupon the wisdome of god hath spoken thus of the spirit as in reference to the saints that learn of him receive and are led by him he shall lead you into all truth bring all things to your remembrance whatever have said ye have an unction little children and ye know all things and not only of the spirit it self that it searcheth all things even the deep things of god but of the spiritual man also to whom the spirit reveals them that he discerneth all things when the animal man nor doth nor can perceive the things of the spirit and that the spiritual men had the mind of christ ioh

and whereas sayes
the apostles themselves did not partake of that divine property of infallibility giving also this reasonless reason for it viz for then they would have been infallible at all times and in all things which they were not as appears by the instance of peter gal

rep
in this as he contradicts the scripture so himself serves us so far as to contradict him to our hands for howbeit he denies any participation of infallibility to us or any ministers in these dayes and also to the very immediate transcribers of the scriptures saying
we say not they were all or any of them anamartetoi infallible yet he denies it not to the first writers
and as for his proof that if they were infallible at all then they would have been so at all times and in all things
that is as pedling a proof as he would count it if should go to prove that david was not at al partaker of the property of holiness because he was not holy but wicked at that time and in that thing wherein he was desil'd in the matter of vriah which would judge as silly an argument as judge ds assertion silly who sayes that david was not a condemned but in a justified estate alias accounted just in the sight of god at that time when he was under the guilt of adultery and murder which a wise man need not be taught to see the folly and fowlness of

thus then and do unminister themselves at least by denying any to be theopneustoi infallibly guided by the infallible spirit in these dayes both of whom may truly bespeak thus

say ye that gods inspir'd ones are all gone then ye of gods inspired ones are none

and who that's wise will mind much in what he saith about things of god who cannot pretend so far as to say he is but rather yeilds to the contrary viz that he is not mov'd acted carried forth nor guided in what he does speak write minister by the infallible direction of the infallible spirit of god but by the fallible guidance of his own and other mens fallible spirits opinions conjectures thoughts who will take such a fallible guide as is fain to confess he is while he denies any guided by the infallible guidance of gods spirit in this age yea doth he not utterly unminister himself and all his fellows while he supposes none now to be theopneustoi moved and inspired by the spirit in their ministerial functions nor to speak as the spirit only gives utterance and as they receive the word immediately out of the mouth of god and while he can say no farther of himself and them but only that they minister out of that furtive

furniture which in their fleshly minds they filch from the letter which out of which and from their fallible expositions of which they minister and of which they are ministers and not of the spirit as the apostles and prophets were which gives the life and is not he an ill bird that bewrayes his own nest an ill son that discovers his own and his fellows and his nakednesses so far as to print it out as obvious to all that the infallible guidance of the infallible spirit is not continued with them nor to be found in these dayes directing any otherwise then without by an outward letter which is fallible and lyable to be falsified at fallible mens pleasure and fancy and to deny all inward pure revelation and immediate inspiration as enthusiasm and to say that there's no means of doing and determining any thing about the matters of god or doctrine of christ now but the letter or writing


and yet in the section to the contradicting of himself to say that that doctrine and these things of god and christ are things of pure divine revelation the knowledge whereof depends upon no such fallible thing as all outward writing is now by his own confession but wholly solely on their revelation from god

and what difference between one that speaks as moved by the spirit or as the spirit gives utterance and one that hath it given him by the spirit what to speak so that he need not premeditate what to say and have not all the saints and disciples of christ a share and part in that promise of having it given them what to speak at the same houre when they are call'd before rulers and governours for christs sake mat

the spirits motions before the motions of sin in the flesh step in and cool and quench them they lie unhealed and be left unsaved for ever and at last no more moved by the lord and his spirit because he often would have led drawn guided and gathered them unto himself but only that they would not will you neither believe the qua nor your selves neither that there are times and opportunities wherein evil men of the world who never are led into higher things by the spirit because they refuse to follow it where it strives are moved theopneusto breath'd and blown upon and with good motions from the spirit and hear the sound of it as of the wind though not heeding it never come to be born nor begotten by it unto god nor to know either whence it cometh or whether it goeth or the hidden life of those that are not so full of about regeneration as ye are who are born no higher then of flesh and blood and the will of man to your fancied faith but born from above of the spirit and of god in very deed

doth god then more or less move all men by his spirit and doth he not move his own people in these dayes by his spirit doth he inspire evil ones sometimes so far though we find few or none of that gang now so far in sight as they were unless they see and say they do not as to make prophets of balaams sauls and caiphasses and will he now have none in his own church of the seed of david himself and doth he do greater things for them and draw them up into his own image a state that must stand when all prophesie shall have an end and will he not do that lesser and lower thing for them by his spirit i.e to use several of them as his prophets and if he have prophets whom he divinely inspires will he do any thing of moment in these last most extraordinary times and not reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets and will he reveal his mind to his prophets as he did to amos and others and will not they go forth and prophesie when the lord hath spoken who can but prophesie when he gives the word himself as he doth in these dayes into the mouths of babes how great must be the company of those that publish it yet such as i.o who of the two are better acquainted with the liberal arts then the liberal hearts would shut these dayes to which the promise of prophesie inspiration revelation vision infallible manifestation as to the measure of it is mostly made from sharing at all in these things with the primitive times which had but the earnest first fruits sprinklings and droppings of that which in fulness was to fall down and be poured forth in these last generations and because these seers see not and these prophets prophesie not themselves the sun being set upon them and they being benighted in that massy chaos of their own divinity that they cannot divine where they are nor infallibly what they have to do they say to the lords own seers see not and to his prophets prophesie not unless you will prophesie smooth things and deceits as we do and cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us and because they cannot let their word be as the word of all the prophets who with one voice flattered ahab to his own ruine but must speak what god bids them which is never good but evil of an evil generation therefore they hate them care not for enquiring of them but represent them to princes and people as

of what hath been spoken then this is the sum there are prophets and men mov'd led and guided by gods infa'lible spirit that by it are fitted though ye deny it to open scripture nor was it ever since it was a scripture more open'd by that infa'lible spirit then now it is and is soon to be yet for all this men that have no more then the outward moses and the prophets do not believe nor repent because they listen not to the light within that calls for doing to all as they would be done by which is the law and the prophets saith christ matth

for want of attending to which they not only repent not at the call of their own dead prophets dead preachings who are yet living in their trespasses and sins but for the most part also not at the preachings of such as minister from the life and not the dead letter only who are quickned and made alive again from their trespasses and sins and so not heeding the light here's no repentance yet though they be warn'd by such as are risen with christ and sent unto them from the dead

now then to make a more full and final enquiry into the cause of that foresaid grand and is it for want of that saving light of god that is if heeded sufficient to guide all men even to that repentance which is to salvation that is never to be repented of nay verily not so neither for all men have from god and a light within them measure of that true light saving i.os and ds bax dark conceits to the contrary which is sufficient to bring them that follow it to salvation but only that its not attended to and this together with that about the letter above spoken to which ye lay as your chief foundation being the chief matters at first intended by me to be controverted with i.o but that well nigh at my beginning in carnest to enter the lists with him ds two young one some while after another coming out upon me occasioned me to make many an extravagant vagary after them into some other doctrinal accountative and narrative businesses for the truths sake more then my own that people might no longer unless they will be led aside from it by his lyes and gu'd with his guilded glosses and counterfeit colours wherewith and smooths and sooths them up in sin and sinister against the truth and the tellers of it in the points abovesaid and covers himself and his false doctrines of iustification of saints in sin personal election of all but a very few from sin in this life and sundry others either more directly and largely as that of iustification or more briefly occasionally or but interlinearily resured before in which i.o is as with him as he with i.o in the rest
shall now betake my self to some more single though short animadversion thereof as it lies in difference between the qua who hold it out for truth and i.o t.d i.t.r.b and the owners of their books extant in which they oppose the qua in print very much if not more then in any other whatsoever and so shall have done with them both at this time
and first shall begin with t.d his two and take account of his mighty weak mannagement of his many meanings as to that matter of the light against the qu of which in many things he means much what as i.o does and is confused and contradictory to himself not a little about it yet must needs say not by so much as i.o is in his mad of his mind in this matter howbeit t.d as to his dispute goes clear beside the question as it was stated about the light as he did about the letter and iustification and strikes much more upon the anvil then on the iron and yet he gives us the quest too at the very beginning to dispute it as he did those two about iustification and the scripture as may appear by what follows

the question between the qua and t.d was as he relates
of his
pamph viz
whether every man that cometh into the world be enlightned by christ which when affirmed t.d as himself relates replyed thus viz
but what light is it you intend we grant that every man hath some light by which he discernes though dimly many sins and duties and severall divine attributes but the mystery of godliness as it is summ'd up
tim

ult
god manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit we deny that all men have the knowledge of
to which question of t.d what light is it you intend when r.h honestly and truly replyed thus viz
the light i.e the light of christ about which only the question was is but one

t.d replies thus viz
the lights mentioned viz and supernaturall light are two and though all have the one yet few have the other
rep
here let all reasonable men judge whether thou dost not clearly yeild us our question which was not at all about the measure of the light whether all have the same measure of it or not for we affirm not that but whether all have some measure of that same light that shines from christ the light of the world yea or nay not whether all have so much as whereby they actually see all the things of god and the gospel which are to be seen or arè seen by some but whether every man hath some or no i.e so much as whereby to discern some of the things of the spirit of god and the gospel severall divine attributes and many duties i.e so many or such as god requires of him in particular who requires of every one according to the ability and degree of light he giveth and accepteth every one according to what he hath from him and not according to what he hath not which measure walking answerably to they stand excused uncondemned alias justified in the sight of god but rebelling against stand accused or condemned and this t.d thon consentest to and affirmest with us so clearly that all thy after dispute upon it does not fetch that again which thou grantest to us it being about another question of thy own starting which we deny not viz
whether all have the actuall knowledge of the mystery of the gospel in the light yea or no for mark we grant sayest thou that every man hath some light i.e is in some sort enlightened by christ for thy grant is to the question above whether by christ or not or else thy answer is beside the purpose and besides
thou denyest not but the gentiles afore christ were enlightned by christ as god though yet to the contradiction of thy self again as if the being enlightned to know and a man knowing were all one thou there sayest they were afarre off from the knowledge of that by whose light be discernes though dimly and how dimly or clearly is nothing to the purpose many sins and duties and several divine attributes

in which words thou sayest as much to our purpose as we would desire thee
its ill stumbling at the threshold at the very entrance of thy work and yet no lesse thou didst again in limine at the very beginning of our disputation with thee about the scriptures being the word of god as is to be read in thy own relation of the second dayes work
of
pamph where thou sayest the question promised to discourse upon was whether the scriptures were the word of god and that indeed was

the question to which as soon as in answer to thy desires of knowing what held about it denyed that the graphe the gramma the scriptures writing or outward text is the word of god thou repliedst by way of compliance with me saying you cannot believe us so simple surely as to affirm the scriptures in that sense to be the word of god and say if not in that sense then in no sense are they so truly and properly that know of but i.o his foresaid who howbeit he is forced to confess ex
to the yielding the cause to the qua that the matter contained in it only is said to be so but that the scripture formally considered or the littera scripta or letter written is not within and is not intended in those innumerable places of scripture where the word of god is said to be preached published multiplied received which as is shewed more at large above is as as for a man to say that the lantern though formaliter it be not so but only the light that is contained in it is so doth yet challenge to it self that name of the light as its proper name yet engages himself against the qua in vindication of the word of god to be the proper name of the scriptures so truly that those are injurious to it and opproious reproachers of it who will not allow it to be properly called by that glorious title

so thou engaging thy self in vindication of the scriptures to be the word of god
giving us the question to have been debated flinkest away into the proof of another matter saying that ye upon the matter contained in the writing which say we is another business the holy truth that is there told and the light and word of god law and gospel there witnessed to being a thing to distinct from the scripture of it that as it is now where the letter is not and was two thousand years before the letter was so it will be for ever for its an euerlasting gospell when the letter of it shall be no more whether that be your rule of faith and life a matter in no wise denyed by the qua if not only by the scripture ye mean as properly ye cannot do the holy doctrine truth word light law gospell of christ therein declared to be in some measure at least in the heart of every man preached in every creature that they may hear and do it but also by thy term our rule of faith and life that which de jure ought to be your rule otherwise if ye say even of that de facto that it is your rule or in esse actuall that which ye do actually and indeed walk by deny even that also for howbeit ye should own that also and not the letter and text only as i.o doth yet so farre are ye from so doing that if thou do not yet at least i.o both doctrinally and practically denies and damnes it down as a meer nescio quid of the qua coyning
moreover much what in the same manner dost thou in the point of iustification give us no lesse then the question as to the termes wherein it was stated and then startest a new question in thy sophisticall
it of which is so familiar with thee that it's seen by any that are but unculi only in the thing called dispute by staring and translating the old one under new termes

for witness thy own disagreeing counterfeited account thereof

pamph the new termes wherein that thou mighest the more easily wrong me by thy wrong representation of me to the world as a rank

papist and render me suspitious and the more securely write me out as thou in the second page of the lying narrative of thy second pamp under that traducing title of one suspected to be a iesuite thou with much ado as thy phrase there is drewest and wrestedst the quest
into and on thy own head they were slated in were whether our good are the meritorious cause of our iustification which hold in the affirmative no further then as by our good works are meant the good works of god and christs own working in us by his spirit which though most truly his are by the spirit it self vouchsafed that name of ours witness isa
not as by ours those only of our own working in our will wisdome and strength are expressed and intended for all such are our righteousnesses which who own none of christs working in us to be so as thou t.d blasphemously dest if
and
of thy pamp be rightly soan'd do own to be but durg and filthy rags according to isa

but the true terms of the quest in which it was stated and debated if we may as sure enough we may believe the joynt testimony of both thy self and those gentlemen and ministers in the margent as in thy epistle thou stilest them of whom there thou sayest also they are witnesses of the terms of the questions agreed to by the qu before the testimony of thy single double lying self were otherwise witness thy own relation thereof in thy lying narrative which hath not any thing at all of that little truth that's in it more true then this wherein pamp setting all these witnesses viz hen oxenden io
boys esqs barry selyard nichols ministers o're against it in the margin to testifie the truth thereof together with thee thou relatest thus the terms of the third quest
were whether good works be the meritorious cause of our iustification which was expresly affirmed by them i.e by the qu

in which terms staring the question without that term our which is of thy own in the other place where even thereby on thy own head thou alterest the stare thereof and makest it clearly another question affirm it to this very day and ever shall to the faces of any of you as occasion is yet owning no works to be truly good but what are done by the believers in christ and his light and done by christ and his power and spirit whether in their persons or his own who never did evil work in his or without blasphemy in paul that can be call'd as thou call'st that he wrought in paul and works in us pauls own and ours which is but dung less and filthy rags or deserve condemnation or any less then justification both of himself and his saints in the sight of god by any good work that ever he wrought either in himself or them

and so my argument a contrariis ye so ball and squabble with me about was both intended and urged in effect viz
if evil works deserve condemnation then good works no condemnation alias iustification but this is true therefore the latter

which question so stated thou t.d not only affirmest with me for thou neither dost nor deny but that we are justified by the good works of christ or that any of his worksare not good or are a violation and not a fulfilling of the law only thou foolishly flamst it off with his

good works done ad extra and not ad intra without only and not within us thy folly in which have largely enough manifested before but also urgest the same thy self
pamp thus viz
evil works which are the violation of the law d·serve condemnation ergo good works that are the fulfilling of the law deserve salvation and we know no good works such sayest thou but christs and so say we too
thus thou givest us that question also

and this g.w tells thee of and turns upon thee in his reply to thy first so plainly that thou dost but add to thy shame in thy reply to him again
of thy
pamp which begins with a flat lye which i'le note here now have it in hand did not sayest thou directly affirm that good works which are the fulfilling the law deserve salvation but that from the rule of contraries which s.f urged we might so argue
now if thou confess that by that rule we may so argue then the thing is so secundum te or else thou canst not truly say we may so argue and that is as directly to affirm it as one need be desired to do so thou hast not much mended thy matter nor by thy lye lick't thy self sound of what g.w laid on thee but indeed thy words as thy self repeatest them in thy first pam
are directly positive and not suppositive for after many other positions thou layest down that thus viz
and again thus the rule will allow to argue which if it be not so then the rule will not allow us so to argue as to what follows in that as its excentrick as to my purpose here to meddle with it so it as well as well nigh all thy doctrinal doings in thy second trifle is no more then what is by praeoccupation answer'd above in my occasional considerations of thy first term'd the qua folly to which thou referrest thy reader so much that thou mightst well nigh as well have said no more to the world in reply to g.w then thus viz
for an answer to g.w
refer the reader to my qua folly which he hath already answered therefore shall say no more to it here

so in those two quest as have shewed thou givest us the quest
and then fallest in with us in a seeming shew of fighting with us about other quest
which we deny no more then thou and thou thy self affirmest as much as our selves and so is it in this quest
about the light thou confessest with us that all have seme light but sayest thou the mystery of godliness as summed up tim

we deny all have the knowledge of and
if your meaning be that the knowledge of the gospel is vouch safed by christ to every man either expect your proof or shall prove the contrary and so upon a taking it for granted as thy own and i.os manner mostly is before its given thee for no such thing did we or r.h consent to by speech or silence saving thy hasty prate and so g.w tells thee in his reply to whom thou having as little to plead in excuse of thy rash charge of us replyest as little in proof of it as that the knowledge of the gospel is vouch safed to every man for we own as g.w there sayes that some are in the darkness and ignorance of the gospel though the light is in them that is able to bring them to know the gospel which they disobeying and not liking to retain god in their knowledge are blind unto
say taking or rather rashly raking that for granted that was not thou proceed'st upon that score plainly belabouring thy self in

evincing a business that none viz that all men do not actually and truly understand the mystery of godlinesse and the gospell and as childishly arguing all along a non actu ad non potentiam a non esse ad non posse from mens not knowing god and christ that they are in no capacity by a measure of light shining from them into their consciences to know them

the mystery of godlinesse sayest thou we deny all men have the knowledge of and so
pamph tis spoken of as a distinguishing mercy to know the mystery of the kingdome of heaven it was given to the disciples not to others matth

rep
to which reply who doubts of this it was hid from some and the knowledge of it given so some not to others but who were these some to whom given when not to others were they not the disciples that learnt at the lips and light of christ what he taught them and saw willingly what he shewed them when the rest who might else have come to know and have had it given them to know as well as these were such as had it declared in them with the righteousness thereof but that they shut their eyes stop their own ears lest they should see and hear that which was contrary to their evil deeds they were ath to leave and reproved them but what of this are they therefore without the light that shewed it and the meanes of the knowledge of it what idle arguing is here the mystery of godliness as summed up tim

ult
god manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit
we deny as well as thou that all men have the knowledge of for without controversie it is great and so great that saving all that knowledge thou thinkest thou hast and wouldest be thought to have of it it remains yet a mystery to thy self but what then will it therefore follow that all men in case they come to his light are not enlightened by christ in some measure to know it because all are not enlightened so much as some are by christ and all do not know what they might know if they hearkened to christ and heeded that light they have therefore some are not enlightened by christ at all here is the sum of t.d arguments and as shall shew anon of i.o i.t r.b also against the saving light of christ's being in some measure in all men
the consequence whereof is as inconsequent as his who disputes from the power to the act or rather from the of a business to the nonpossibility of it to be to which from the other no wise man nor any who is not more sophisticos then truly sophos will once offer to argue
to be without knowledge is one thing to be without the meanes of it is another to be ignorant of the mystery of godliness the gospel and kingdome is one thing and not to be in potentia eriam proxima in an immediate possibility to know it or to be utterly without any of that light which leads to it is another

men may have light to see by and the faculty or sence of sight too who yet may shut their eyes and not see at all men may have the faculty of understanding given them from god whereby to know him as iohn
he hath given an understanding i.e faculty that we may know him that

is true and this all men have the inward visive faculty unlesse fools that are in their naturals who yet have the faculty too for defect in it doth not nullifie it though thou
flishly and absurdly limits that as a speciall gift to only as if the nations of men were without the faculty of understanding whereby to converse with spirituall objects if revealed to them by the light and it be heeded and some are in the actual understanding of him that is and that is indeed the special gift of god to such as walk by that light and in th light have as iohn and christs disciples did and do

and over and above that faculty they may have a light to objects to that understanding and enlighten them that they may savingly and yet may never come to for all in case they come not to this light as evil ones do not iohn
but hate it and chuse rather willingly to be ignorant not delighting in but saying to god depart from us we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes
from may be to must be is such a sort of sillogirt ation as is not owned in foro academico in the schools of meer animall naturall men much lesse of christ and christians
and so that men know not see not therefore they may not cannot see if they will have neither eyes nor light this is as meer a as to say of such as not being willing to behold it shut their sore eyes against the that therefore they have no eyes and the sun shines not at all upon them
yet this is the common topick from whence our divines as we shall see by and by and in a manner all our doctors draw their dreams and deeply dark arguments against a measure of christs saving light so shining in every one and the now empty quiver out of which they have spared till they have spent all they have to shoot too shoot their sharpest shafts against the quakers not having so much light left in for want of walking in time by what they had as to heed that men may know that if they be not wanting to themselves which if they be by not trading with their talent they may also be as ignorant of as they might have been knowing in
sayes every man hath a light and that light is from christ too witness his own saying wherein unawares he himself again to the contradicting of himself yielding up the question to us
pamp expounding iohn
viz christ enlightens every man that is enlightened from which ad hominem argue back upon himself out of his own words viz christ enlighteneth every man that is enlightened this aserts from iohn
but every man is enlightened hath some light whereby he discernes many sins and duties and divine attributes this cannot deny for this is his own
therefore though to the shame contradicting and confounding of himself he does so yet cannot rationally nor honestly deny what the qua affirm that every man is enlightened by christ the light of the world and mediator between god and man
indeed sayes tis but dimly that all men discern some sins duties divine attributes

repl
to that as its nothing to the question so reply every man discerns them not so clearly as he might do because he heeds not so heartily

as he should do the light that shewes them

its nothing whether men see and understand or no its enough that the light shines into their hearts and understandings to give the knowledge of and so it doth in them who are yet in darkness and in a stare of it for the true light shines in the darkness though the darkness comprehends it not joh
thinks he mends all in
of his
pamp by eph
ye were sometimes darkness but now light in the lord
rep what then did not the light shine in them when they were and did not comprehend it because not turned to it as now they were by pauls ministry who was sent to turn men from the darkness to the light that shines within them by which they became light in the lord yet if your meaning be sayest thou there and that is our meaning indeed that all men have the light of the gospel within them only all do not obey it tis contrary to the scripture
rep why so he opposes the state of darkness sayest thou in which they were to their present state of light
rep what then because they were in a state of darkness had they no light shining in them by taking heed to which at last they came out of it into a state of light how often shall need to tell thee and that for the true light and kingdome and gospel and righteousness to be in us in semine in the seed is one thing and for us to be in that is another the kingdome of god even the seed of righteousness peace spiritual joy as evident as the contrary seems to be to blind ex

who there sayes in omnibus non esse justitiam pacem gardrum in confesso est its evident that righteousness peace and joy are not in all was sown in the pharisees as the word of god is in four sorts of ground whereof but one that is the honest heart that receives it with meekness when there implanted inlaid ingrasted brings forth the fruits thereof unto perfection though the pharisees never entered into it witness himself who howbeit he joyus with in saying from luke
the kingdome was among the pharisees only in the ministry of it without mistaking it to be en umin as if twere twere enough against him for entos umon which confesses is us'd but once more in all the new testament text matth

where it signifies the very inside of a vessel yet joyns with me also both against and himself too in the same place

pamp saying the expression may import that the which upon a mistake such a one say as upon which our pharisees look for it without them at this day they did look for without them was indeed a kingdome within them and yet he sayes this kingdome in them was threatned to be and was too say at last as it shall from you taken away from them

how often shall we need to tell you ye blind and deaf that to have light shining in one is one thing and to be in it in a state of light and the children of it is another to have the gospel preached in men is one thing and for men to learn the mystery of it is another the gospel is preached in every creature under heaven paul sayes col
en pase te ktisi yea have they not all heard saith he rom yes verily alluding

to psal
by which allusion thou thy self also expresly confesses t.d
pamp the apostle would intimate that the knowledge of the gospel should be of as large extent in the publication as the knowledge of god by the ministry of the heavens and the firmament which is so to every individual man that there's neither speech nor language male nor female where their voice is not heard the found is gone out into all the world and their words even christs and the spirits within for the outward words and writings of men preaching the gospel thereby have never yet extended nor reached so largely as to all men to the ends of the earth

yet all have not obeyed the gospel saith he no not israel it self without of whose having the outward letter of the statutes and iudgements which thou as sillily callest against thy self too as g.w truly tells thee in another case callest in both thy pamphlets the supernatural light or knowledge of the gospel thou keepest such a scraping as if that fleshly natural seed of abraham and their natural fleshly wayes of knowing what they know which was little of the mystery cor
by that natural reading and poring upon the letter as ye also do were the most supernatural men and means as to the saving knowledge of the gospel in all the world whereas the iews were as meer animal and naturall as your selves who savingly know nothing by the letter say that israel it self obeyed not and why not because as husie as they were with you in their bible they regarded not but rebelled against the strivings of the lord himself with them by his light and spirit within therefore saith paul ver
as the reason render'd by god himself isa
all day long have stretched out my hands to a disobedient and people
also that they have the light in them who yet neither believe in it nor are the children of it but yet abiding in darkness is as clear from chrihs own words iob
am the light of the world he i.e he of the world that followeth me shall not abide in darkness but have the light of life walk while ye have the light while ye have the light believe in the light that ye may be it seems they yet were not so yet had a light in them to believe in the children of the light some of which light was come not unto them only but into the world also ver
that who e're believes in it might come out of darkness and evil ones had it come to them as well as such as did truth though they came not to it as the other did else they could not be said to see and hate it and so christ and the father whose will was revealed in it as they are iohn
and

so christ is come by his light as the sun by its beams into some dark dungeon into the dark world the dark places of mens hearts and of the earth that are full of the habitations of cruelty dens of devils cages of unclean and hareful birds holds of cruel wicked fowl and filthy spirits to give life and that abundantly iohn
yea he came to the scribes of old by his light not outward person only to that end yet they had not the light of life why so ye hear not gods voice saith he and have not his word which ye put from you abiding in you ye search the scriptures which testifie of me who am the life and there ye look to have it and come not unto me that ye might have life joh

wisdome christ the wisdome of god reproves cryes to men in their own consciences by his own voice light and spirit in their hearts even to scorners simple ones that hate knowledge and would poure out his spirit on them as on others but some hearken not hate turn away so are slain and perish not for want of warning counsel light from christ to lead who is given as the one leader and to all persons and people but for want of taking heed to him who teaches and looking to his law in the heart which enlightens

thou call'st as i.o does falsly the letter christs light and the only means that men can come to saving knowledge by yet heed'st no more then he to his to thy own satisfaction that all who have it and look and read in it too as the scribes did have not the knowledge of god and his kingdome by it and yet if we should say of those men that come not to life by the letter therefore they have not the letter would'st thou not say of us that we are mad mutato nomine the argument is thine to usward as concerning christs light in the conscience yet nunquam videns id manticae quod in tergo est thou canst not see it
the corinthians had the light shining in their hearts to give the knowledge yet all of them had not the true knowledge of god and that they had not when he shone by his light in them twas their fault else paul could not have spoken it as he does cor to their own shame and this may stand as an answer to thy pedling reply to g.w when he urg'd from cor
that the light shone in the corinthians hearts in whose hearts sayest thou

pamp not of all mankind but of the apostle and some others a small number in comparison of the rest who were not enlightned and to back that thy shameful blindness in limiting the shinings of the true light into such a little nook as a small number thou boltest out much more saying from ver
the gospel is hid to them that are lost and there are some to whom the light shines not not heeding as said before that that may be in men which men may hate smoother and hide in their own hearts and be lost for want of the sight of when not for want of the light it self that men may have the serse of sight and the presence of light and yet not see but shut their eyes that that may shine in them which they giving way to the god of this world to blind their minds may not shine out unto them as a candle may shine in a room yet if put under a bushel not shine out to it and a talent to trade with may be given to him who hiding his lords money shall reap little profit by it and at last have what light he had within taken from him and be cast forth without into the outer darkness
didst never read of those that seeing and hearing would neither see nor hear nor understand nor perceive as they might therefore at last should not if they would and because thou askest in whose hearts say in the hearts of some who did not see and know in the corinthians hearts so that they all had the light and might have seen but only that some would be ignorant and of such sayes paul cor
if any man will be ignorant let him be ignorant

and sith thou sayest not in the hearts of all mankind say yea of all mankind if any be exempted it must be the heathen that know not god

the wicked ones that like not to retain god in their knowledge that have not the law in the letter of it according to thy principles but such are not exempted for rom
that which is to be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it in them even his eternal power and godhead and the invisible things of god from the beginning which in his own light within are clearly seen by the things which are made for the heavens declare his glory the firmament shews his without and by his light within in the understandings of men taking occasion thereby to contemplate on his greatness and goodness as david did psalm
when behold the heavens moon and stars the work of thy fingers lord think what is man saith he that thou visitest him how excellent is thy name and such like doth god reveal his greatness and goodness in regarding the sons of men

object
that makes for us thou mayest perhaps say god by these preachers without gives the knowledge of himself to the heathen but what is this to your light within we confess quoth
that god reveals and declares himself to us by the works of his hands without creation providence
his works teach and what they teach they do it in his name and authority

repl
the heavens declare the glory of god only passively as books on which by the light within men may see and read it as also they may in the outward letter which more verbally though lesse visibly declares it but not so actively as tutors that make a verball discourse upon it for that is done by the light within by which that tou theou is said to be manifested more immediately by god himself in them for howbeit the works of god hands the outward creation have a more visible stamp or character of gods greatnesse and goodnesse on them then the meer outward letter hath that is the works of mens hands and fingers though writing as inspired what they see by the light within and the letter and outward character thereof makes a more formall wordy narration of it then the works do yet that which most powerfully and effectually and actually teaches daily what the other in their respective more obscure and inferiour wayes do declare ad extra must be something ad intra which falls in with and teaches men even the spirit of god in the faculty of mans understanding and conscience and the inspiration of the almighty job
that gives the and knowledge of him whether by or without the other which without the other and often doth to men born blind give the knowledge of god as those ad extra can never do without this for whatever knowledge men have of god its by it and whatever is to be known of god by men it is as the sun by its own light manifested by this of god in them only and not by the outward seeing of a of a or writing ad extra which cannot be seen themselves any otherwise then as bruits may behold them bodily without not only the faculty of the rationall wind which is the eye but the light from god also to manifest the object to the understanding which light is not eyes quoth
tis not the visive faculty or understanding it self but a of light communicated from the holy spirit to the understanding for the removall of the dark shades that are over the mind

whereby it is led to see and judge of truth as men see by the suns light or else they cannot though they have eyes howbeit elsewhere ex
to the shamefull contradiction of himself again i.o sayes this light is the eye of the mind lumen hoc est oculus mentis and
lux est facultas illa intelligendi opsis dianoias omma tes psuches ophthalmos dianoias making light and sense or the visive faculty as one whereas before he had said one was not the other rotas for where both these are not viz
eyes and light suitable to the object and the one exercised and the other improved also deest aliquid intus still somewhat within is lacking either eyes or light or as tis in such as have not forfeited those willingness to see when they may and men can no more see god by the letter nor his works without then beasts that can with bodily eyes discern both the skies and the scriptures and in a word unlesse the light within manifest this and it be heed by men also though there be both skies and scriptures without obviated to men without and that faculty of the understanding also within yet can men in their minds come to no more true knowledge of god then they can without the light of the sun without which manifests them and it self also see the outward sun and materiall heavens with the outward eye not only the faculty of sight in the eye and also a light to shew the objects needful else as t.d himself sayes a blind man might see when there is light and a seeing man when none but a third thing is needful too i.e an eye opened to the light and to the object else he that hath eyes and light too may shut his eyes and not see it and as whatever is to be known of god is to be known by that light within or not at all so by it are men capable to see and know taliter qualiter in such measure as they have of the light not only some things sins duties divine attributes as dimly and diminitively delivers himself about this but also as they grow in it by degrees everything as well as any of the things of god to gnoston that are knowable or to be known of him by man to his own salvation say in such a degree which varies not the case as men have of it they may come to know all things answerably taking head to it and doing the will of god as revealed in it and that not naturally as by the help of a naturall light as our naturalists or meer animall academians call it but spiritually as by such or such a measure of the spirituall light that flows not as i.o sains and t.d would fain seem to make it also as the rationall faculty it self a principiis naturae but from god christ and the spirit into the minds of men and in such wise as they know any thing in that they know it spiritually by a supernatural and spirituall inward immediate revelation of it to them by god himself whereupon contrary to that vsteron proteron of our carnal naturall and litteral preachers who say that is supernaturall knowledge only that is attained to by reading the letter which letter with t.d and the rest is the spirituall light and that but naturall which comes from gods own light into all mens consciences which light they will by no meanes allow to be called spirituall but naturall affirm that to be but the naturall knowledge of the meer annuall naturall man that is scrued out by the improvement of their naturall faculties of reading remembring in their academicall arteficiall scrutinies into the scripture which

naturall knowledge though theirs who wrote the scriptures to be by immediate spirituall revelation deny not abounded among the iewish doctors scribes and meer naturall rabbies that stole the true prophets words yet knew not god spiritually by hearing his words which are spirit nor by that spirituall revelation or inward immediate reception of ought from his own councell light and mouth from which only comes the true spirituall understanding little lesse then it doth among our modern ministers of the letter who not coming to the light know as little of the spirit of god who is a spirit though they read and preach he is a spirits from the letter and as little of the mystery of the gospell spiritually as they

though then and both call the common light in mens consciences whereby they know much of god of his will as to marter of sin and duty and of his divine attributes iudgements and all the knowledge that comes thereby but naturall and call the letter and all the knowledge that comes now by reading of that only spirituall see t.d
of his
pamph

of his second by the statutes and iudgements given to israel which with is the outward letter of the old testament are meant the supernaturall light or knowledge of the gospell but rom
which speaks of the light or law in the conscience is spoken quoth he of naturall light opposed to the knowledge of the iews
and
the scripture is a morall and spirituall not a naturall light but that in all mens consciences he calls
the light of nature and
where he calls that from the light a naturall knowledge arising from the innate principles of and that which is from the reading of the letter a supernaturall revelation ex
where how to the contradiction of himself he also calls it spirituall and not naturall may appear anon
speaking of the qua negant lumen hoc naturale esse aut itadici debere sed a christo spiritu christi esse they deny this light to be naturall on that it ought to be so called saying its from christ and the spirit of christ
lumen internum omnibus commune naturale est the light within common to all is naturall and so proceeds in suo genere to prove it likewise and say the same
it is yielded that there is naturall light from christ given every man such light as christ as mediator conferrs not on every person but all sorts of men is termed supernaturall so
and elsewhere they call it light by nature and humane light yet say the quite contrary the letter and the knowledge it gives is the naturall as have shewed above by which wicked men that corrupt themselves also in those things come to know naturally and not spiritually nor savingly the mind and will of god ex principiis naturae by custome often use and memory as brute beasts may by outward observance and custome know somewhat of the mind and will of man iude but the light in the conscience some of which all have and the knowledge that comes thereby is the spirituall supernaturall and not the naturall light and knowledge this in the power of god trust in brief to make good against you all though enough hath been said afore to any but such as you that will look for more proof of it then wise men would do

one argument by which its evident to all that are not blind as ye are that the law in the heart or light in all mens consciences is not naturall and so consequently is spirituall is even this from whence t.b concludes it naturall viz because opposed to the knowledge of the of the iews knowledge by the letter was but naturall the light within and knowledge by that being opposed to it must be not naturall and so consequently spirituall but that was but naturall for they were mostly but naturall men and worse as they are at this day persecuting and opposing ever the things of god christ the gospel and the spirit and all that are born after it and have the spirituall knowledge of the mystery by it as the naturall knowers by the letter do at this day and that the natur all man discernes not any otherwise then naturally and not savingly and so not spiritually the things of god and the spirit paul tells us cor
and t.d also tells us
of his
pamph
from that very text of paul where he gives this reason for it also because they are spiritually discerned

whence take occasion to argue further thus viz argum

that light which gives to discern savingly as heeded the deep things of god and the spirit which none but the spirit of god and christ searches out knows and savingly reveals and which as to salvation are not by the naturall man but spiritually and by the spirituall man only discerned who hath the mind and spirit of christ must be not a naturall but a spiritual and supernaturall light and the knowledge that comes by it is not natural but supernatural and spirituall
but the light in the consciences of all gives to discern the deep thing of god the spirit in some i.e in such a measure as its heeded which none but the spirit of god searches
therefore it and the knowledge that is by it is not naturall but supernatural and spiritual
the mino which our divines do deny is as evident to such as live in the light as the light it self is and not a little of it evidenced by their own who oppose it
two particulars there are in it to be proved
that the light in all manifests or gives as heeded to discern in some measure the things of god and the spirit

that as heeded it manifests them savingly

as to the first need go no further then your selves for witness we have it under your own hands pamph confesses of that light of which all men have some that thereby all discern not may sins only which are the works of the flesh which the letter sayes are manifest not by it self but by the light christ gives gal compared with eph but also many duties and severall divine attributes
now mens duties to god in matter of declining sin eschewing evill and doing good and gods divine attributes are things of god and the spirit or else neither nor those who wrote the scripture neither know what the things of god and the spirit are for they tell us that our duties of love ioy peace meekness long suffering temperance patience and such like are the fruits of the spirit and that not fulfilling the lusts of the flesh in the sins of adultery

fornication uncleanness lasciviousness hatred wrath strife envy drunkenness revellings and such like works of it is the fruit effect and issue of walking in the spirit and if these love be not things of the spirit excuse me if say the spirit which moved them to write that gal

knew not his own things himself and if ye say that gods divine attributes mercy iustice iudgements truth holiness are none of his things excuse me also if favour not foolish fancies so far as to spend time pains and paper to prove they are to them which is so clear that twere as idle a thing to make clearer then it is as twere to light a candle to shew a blind man qui ad caecutire vult that the sun shines and that the light doth manifest not only sins and duties but the said divine attributes also as we have had t.ds witness against him so let us take os testimony against himself too and then we shall be pretty well as to that which i.o preaches it out in print in two tongues lest one should not be loud enough in english thus
by the innate light of nature so he calls it and principles of the consciences of men that indispensible moral obedience which he requireth of us his creatures subject to his law is made known by the light that god hath indelibly implanted in the minds of men accompanied with a moral instinct of good and evil seconded by that which he hath placed in us in reference to his own over us doth he reveal himself to the sons of men the voice of god in nature so he calls it declares it self to be from god by its own light and authority there's no need to convince a man by substantial witnesses that what his conscience speaks it speaks from god whether it bear testimony to the being righteousness power omniscience or holiness of god himself or whether it call for that moral obedience which is eternally and indispensably due to him and so shews forth the work of the law in the heart those common notions are in laid in the natures of men by the hand of god to this end that they may make a revelation of him as to the purposes mentioned and are able to plead their own divine original mark of divine original here by gods hand yet anon flowing ex principis naturae without the least strength or assistance from without and in latine ex

non tantum multae coinat thus not only many common notions and principles of truth abide fixed in the understanding by the efficacie of which men may discern some divine things and discern between good and evil but also by the help of the conscience take heed to themselves as concerning many duties with respect had to the iudgement of god which they know they are liable to moreover this light in all at years of understanding by the consideration of the works of god creation and providence manifesting his eternal power and godhead and in some by the word preached may be improved and confirmed but how far this light can direct stir up and provoke mens minds to yield obedience to god and they by it be left without excuse it pertains not to this place more precisely to discuss
one of the main things pertaining to this point about the light to be discussed among the rest yet
believe was afraid to thrust his fingers too far into the fire here for fear lest too narrowly how far the efficacy of this light extends he should being forced to see somwhat that he is loath to see both his cause and open his conscience too wide and therefore would wade no further there

need not open it to him that is not defective in his naturals how in all this as if not more abundantly then in that above confesses and witnesses to the truth of the first part of my minor proposition viz that the light in the conscience of all as heeded gives the knowledge of those things of god and his spirit which the spirit of god only knows searches and shews and reveals to such as wait in his light to have the mind of christ manifested in them therein which the natural man by a natural light cannot so know and
only

ob
if it be objected those are the deep things of god there spoken of cor
which your light in the conscience of all is too shallow to search out yea the glorious things of the gospel it self the mystery of which t.d who knows it not yet himself for want of turning to it sayes by that light within all know not and the natural man discerns not
answ
that the natural man which is he that leans to the letter and his own understanding and looks not to the lord in his own light and spirit in the heart as spiritual men do and in the doing of which men of natural become more and more spiritual de facto discerns no otherwise then naturally not savingly and spiritually still grant but a non esse ad non posse still nil valet our question is how far that light heeded avails that way which affirm is so far that according to the measure of it in men and their attendance to it it leads gradually as the light and spirit and anointing of god is said to do such as abide in it as it in them into all truth the knowledge of the very deep things of god and the gospel a dim shallow sight of which it gives to such as turn to the least beam of it in them the iudgements of god are one of the deep things of god thy iudgements are a great deep rom
his judgements and the wayes of it and wisdome of god therein are a depth the his iudgements his wayes past finding out no natural man by the improvement of his natural understanding in reading the letter can know them israel did not who had the iudgements and the statutes in the letter for want of looking to the light and spirit any more excepting the few spiritual ones and children of the light that were ever hated among them nay nor so much as many heathens that had and heeded the law or light in the conscience yet had no law in the letter but were more sottish stupid fearless of god ignorant and prophane then the heathen among whom the name of god was blasphemed for their sakes insomuch that paul saith rom
the very uncircumcision as to the flesh and letter doing in the light by which they were made a law to themselves by nature not corrupt nature as thinks nor by the pure nature in a measure restored without or abstract from the light the things of the law were better to god then the literal professing iew and more just and justified to the very judging of them who by boasting of the letter and circumcision without broke the law in the heart and less lyable to wrath then the other which shews how god counts more on obedience in morals spirituals evangelicals without the letter and literals then on all and sacrifice and lifeless conformity to the letter

yet the heathen themselves by the light in the conscience though

videntes meliorae by it they did mostly deteriwa sequi see much and do little at least came to know in a measure within themselves the very righteous iudgments of god that that did such things as they did are worthy of death rm
and thou i.o confessest the same in thy words iudicio dei se subesse cogu scunt and the light within and moral instinct of good and evil by it seconded by a placed in us yea ioh
the light and spirit of christ the saints comforter that walk in it is in the office of a convincer to the world of sin and iudgement the law which is the light in all is spiritual rom

ob
and if ye say we grant that but what of the gospel of the righteousness of god and the riches of his grace in christ and what of christ can be known in that light answ
if ye will needs count the iudgement and wrath of god which is a depth unsearchable by any that look only in the letter which only tells of his wrath or by any save such as living in the light have come to feel it within themselves for who knows the power of thy wrath saith the psalmist none say but such as waiting in the light have felt the weight of his hand while judgement and condemnation passed on their evil deeds say if ye will reckon wrath iudgement and the ministration of condemnation none of the things of god none of his deep things nor the things of his spirit and gospel because your eyes are out but reckon it to the law or old testament only and not to the gospel to which yet it truly belongs or new which is the ministration of righteousnesse and mercy yet answer further that not only iudgement and wrath but the righteousness salvation mercy and grace of god in christ and christ himself is preached and revealed in the same light in which the iudgement and wrath is revealed as it is the effectual work of the law in the to accuse reprove and condemn him that doth evil so apello appeal to your selves who assert it is is it not its work to excuse acquit justifie him within himself who declines the evil and does the good is there true righteous iudgement done where as well mercy comfort peace and acceptation with god is not ministred to the innocent though abimelech the heathen when they are found in integrity of heart to gentile as well as iew as terrour rejection and wrath to every soul that doth evil iew or gentile

beside say not the texts that the spirit convinces the world of righteousness as well as of sin and iudgement and that in the same light which is indeed the gospel and call'd by paul so and the power of god unto salvation in which the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that withhold the truth told them by god himself and his light in them in unrighteousness the righteousness of god also is even therein revealed from faith to faith among the iust that turn to and own the light and live by faith in it rom know and see how page
pamp
would make a difference if he could tell how that he might maintain his natural or rather natural about the meer naturalness of that light that shews sins duties divine attributes between that one light say in which the wrath is revealed and in which the righteousness is revealed where in answer to that unanswerable saying

of paul about the to gnoston tou theou when g.w used it against him thus thou sayest tis meant of a natural light whereas tis said to be the knowledge of whatsoever is to be known of god rom
t.d replyes thns sillily the apostle intends that what might be known of god without the preaching of the gospel was known to the gentiles verse
tis by the gospel that the righteousness of god is revealed

rep as if we must think the apostle in that phrase whatever is to be known of god is manifest in men excluded and excepted the light of the gospel and inward word of which he talks elswhere rom
that its nigh to men in their hearts and col
is preached viz in every creature under heaven and meant only some nescio quid know not what kind of manifestation that hath nihil commune cum scripturis holds no analogy with the scripture because t.d makes his shallow sensless on the place whose reply but tis his usual way when he has nought else to say to make what additions to and alterations of a text he pleases and then to say when there's no such matter either expressed or implyed it intends so and so or it intends not so though so said god indeed in many texts makes offer of salvation to all but intends it only to a few by all is meant some by in us in christ and many of the like sort is not worth any other reply then to tell him it's not worth a rush and ws saying to him out of paul stands o're ds head still for to gnoston what is to be known of god is any thing that tends to mans salvation without such an exception as t.d adds to the making of paul there as he does god and the penmen in many more texts dissemble like to t.d himself so as to speak one thing and intend another that destroyes the very sense of his own words
but saving ds of that matter assuredly enough the same that reveals the wrath reveals the righteousness retro and that that reveals the righteousness is a measure of the light of the gospel of gods rich grace and goodness that is given to impenitents to lead them to repentance if they obey it and so to forgiveness and life or otherwise to leave them without excuse when having trifled away the time of gods and forbearance in rebellion against the light god comes in his righteous iudgement to take full and finall vengeance upon them whereupon it is called the riches of gods goodness which is never the lesse to them though they perish in their wills even to them that yet despise it by which they are not left without faithful reproof and warning within themselves but are put in fair capacity for salvation from the wrath for the despising of which light that will not let them sin themselves to ruine without stopping them till they be obstinate they treasure up wrath to themselves against the day of it
rom
despisest thou the riches of his grace not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance

arg
that which is the riches of gods goodness and grace to the very wicked that despise it and perish which would else lead them to repentance and life must needs be a part of the gospel and its light but such is that which leaves and is in all men in the very wicked leaving them inexcusable if they repent not by it therefore that light in all men iew and gentile good and bad is a measure of the light of the gospel

which ye puffers at it would fain shut up from shining in common in al men among a few such unhallowed elect ones and seeming saints as your selves for that the grace of god that brings salvation where it is to such as put it not far from them should be said by us as it was of paul tit to appear to all men is as damnable heresie with you in us as tis undeniable truth with you as told by paul yea this ye are impatient at that proclamation of grace and good will from god to all men with true intent that all should have it that are as willing to have it as god is they should or otherwise then pretendedly as you make it should be made and yet the churl that practises hypocrisie and utters errour against the lord and howbeit he sayes eat friends drink yea drink abundantly every one that thirsteth life as well as death is freely and truly set before you chuse life that ye may live and welcome christ is come that ye may have life and that abundantly yet makes empty the soul of the hungry and causes the drink of the thirsty to sail by telling them that god freely proffers this to all but intends it only to a few would be called bountiful and liberal for all this but it must not be in the day that is coming wherein the eyes of such as see shall not be dim and the eye of the old seer be darkened the tongue of the stammerer tell the plain truth and the mouth of the university student be stopped and the lips of the lyar be shut up isai
this common salvation iude
ye cannot digest twas wont to be said bonum quo us eo melius but if should say instead of bonum quo communius eo melius it were not more false latine then the tale of a tender of life from god to all men intended only to a few is the false doctrine of our divines which false doctrine they contradict and confute themselves in also if once they could see wood for trees as fast as another can well confound them while themselves tell us of not only a special but a common grace which is the common distinction of the schools for if it be grace though common grace it must be a light a gift a part of the gospel of gods grace out of which gospel no grace is and such a part and gift too as must at least by its sufficiency to save such as improve it put all in a capacity for salvation and not sufficient only to leave them without excuse and aggravate wrath and condemnation upon them otherwise that grace is no true grace or favour or if it be give me none of that grace take you ye graceless gravers of that grace whose graven image it is that hath a being only in your imaginations that grace wholly to your selves that is given for no such gracious end or purpose as to put men into possibility of salvation as upon your principles of personal this common grace does not but only to render them unavoidably lyable to sorer condemnation and fuller wrath then they should ever have known had they never had it

but what e're ye carve to your selves in your own conceits god had to the whole world as well as to you choice sinners and in as fair a capacity ally to partake of it are the very heathen who by you are by the lump as your antichristian selves except ye repe then ie by your books ye have ever yet done to a and sin acknowledgement of the truth nor did god send his son a light the that mostly perish in their wills to any such intent that the

world it self should be condemned but that the world through him might be saved

so then its no less then a measure of the light of the gospel it self a dram at least and degree of gods grace and that not natural but spiritual supernatural sufficient for men and saving to such as submit to be taught by it which from god is imparted and by his hand as thou i.o speakest indelibly implanted in the minds of all men whereby his things and the things of christ and his spirit come by such as wait on him in it to be both spiritually and savingly discerned
and ob
if ye object yet further as some do we yield that what is to be known of god his invisible things his eternal power and godhead divine attributes and our moral duties to him in declining moral evils and doing much moral good as to our creator eternally and indispensably due are manifested in measure by that common light but deny that any thing of christ still and of the mysteries of the gospel is so and so its still but a natural nor a spiritual light

answ
though what said above from cor
concerning the things that eye hath not seen and the deep things of god which must be of the mysteries of the gospel might suffice yet shall add thus much more viz
that it savours of little less then a little of that gross darkness which is to cover the earth and its people when the light of god arises upon his own to say that god can be known in or by any light in which christ first is not known know this is a riddle to you rabbies and may seem to all sottish seers as a piece of a mad mans divinity but dare aver it to be truth though can't believe many of our english infidels will believe it till they see it so clearly that they cannot chuse for how many wayes of knowing god ye may coin to your selves in your own conceits care not for knowing for more then a good many ye have but this know that if the scriptures be true as know they are which ye profess to be your rule of tryal for all things there is noe true way of coming to the true knowledge of god so much as a iudge much less as a father but one and that is neither the scripture itself which tells of that way nor any thing else but christ himself and his light to whom god hath committed all iudgement which iudgement he administers by his light before any see his face as a father in righteousness and live he hath given forth a light to the world whereby to know himself but this light is in his son he that hath the son and believeth on the son in whom is the life and his life is the light of men hath everlasting life he that hath not and believeth not in the son hath not life though he is capable of it but by the light in which he stands condemned the wrath of god yet abideth on him so that whereas ye say there's knowledge of god but not of christ by that universal internal light there is in truth no knowledge of god at all but in the light of christ who bears his image who gives forth the light of the knowledge of his own glory in the face of iesus christ am the way saith he john
the truth and life no man cometh to the father but by me the father reveals the son in men by his light before he reveals himself gal

so that as no man knows the son but he in whom the father reveals him so no man knoweth the father but the son and he to whom the son will

of his
pamp he it is that by his spirit and light within which the letter only relates of doth reveal him ioh
men must know christ in his light which cornelius was in which is his day that abraham saw whether they ever see his fleshly person yea or nay before they can know god who is known in nothing but his own light the son who is known in nothing but his own light the spirit that comes from and leads to him so that to say as a professor of note said in a publike assembly in ireland of a friend of truth call'd a qua whom know having heard him speak this man knows much of god but little of christ is little less then a bull that favours for all the natural literal knowledge of both of little less then a spiritual ignorance in the mystery of both god and christ

and this gives me the hint to make mention of another argument that this light is not natural which is in all viz because it comes from god and christ into every creature not by creation as the rational soul and its faculties of understanding will mind memory conscience it self do and such properties as are de esse hominis whether constitutive or consecutive so that a man is no man at all or hath not the essential form of a man as distinct from the outward brutum or beast of the field

for a man may remain phusicos a natural man or rather psuchicos as the word is in many places where rendred natural as well as where sensual cor
cor
iam
iude
a true animal man a man that hath a soul rational and sensitive though in its faculties defaced clouded darkned benighted and lost from the lord and his light now withdrawn from him even after the light is kid from his eyes as it was ever at last from such as to any life by it who would not be led to life by it while they had it witness the pharisees and ierusalem and after he remains now irrecoverable for want of light to the primitive pure nature which only loveth and obeyeth the law and delighteth truly in the light

the light then say comes from god and christ into the mind and conscience not as the soul and its essential faculties of understanding will do which with the organical body make that one compositum call'd man that may be either in unity and communion with god and christ or in onmity and separation from them according as he walks or walks not in the light that shines from them but by way of immediate infusion from them into the mind and conscience which of itself is a dark place pet

and destitute as to the knowledge of god without a measure of it as a thing distinct and separable from the man in whom it is and a witness against him when he runs from the will of god revealed to him in it though eternally one with god and christ from whom it shines and flows and not ex principiiis natura as sayes with whom it ever sides let the man go whether he will never consenting to any but condemning all iniquity committed by him and counselling continually whether heeded or no before hand against it and lastly from whom it is as unchangeably inseparable as the light beams and rayes of the sun are from the sun it self from whence they shine with which they are in conjunction still whether this or that part of the world be actually enlightned by it or by the moons interposing eclipsed from it yea or no

so that upon these considerations it can't be natural as i.o.t.d
i.t r.b deems it but do nothing at all to the purpose in proof of it so to be
so that in further proof of it to be spiritual and supernatural and disproof of their position that its natural to save the pains and charge of laying them out at length lay down these following proofs which wise men may argue out more at large to their fuller satisfaction within themselves

argum
the light in all consciences shines thereinto from god christ and his spirit therefore tis not natural but supernatural and spiritual for these two viz natural and spiritual natural and supernatural do tollere se invicem are inconsistently denominated of one light and that it is spiritual is shew'd after also the consequence denies not but confirms while himself ex

opposes all light that can be call'd natural to that which is from christ and his spirit

and as for the antecedent that its from god christ and his spirit is as evident from their own confessions and declarations calls it the voice of god page
indeed he adds in nature by which tis like he intends that which nature utters or the voice of nature but there is no voice of god which is natural to man that know of he that finds out that chimera must have it in the nineth chapter of no where at all or else in the tenth of go look it for he will never meet with that monster in the scripture nor in any rule of right reason indeed nature may be said to have a voice as well that of man who is fearfully and wonderfully made as that of the natural material heavens all which declare suo modo ut prius the glory of god the maker nor is there speech or language where this voice of nature is not heard but that this voice of nature is the voice of god in the conscience or that light within he speaks of or that the light or voice of god in the heart is a

voice of god de esse hominis essential and natural to man credat apella

he calls it page
a light god hath implanted in the minds of men that which speaks to man from god of a divine original and such like terms as are exclusive of its being but natural for himself pleads the divine original of the letter as now which yet is not of so immediate a divine original by far as the light by which god speaks nigh in the heart for at first it came to men from him through the hands of holy men and now to us through the hands of how many unholy men we know not in proof of its being a true spiritual and not a natural light and also exclusive of its being the mind and conscience it self as some call it saying it's conscience it's conscience when as it is as distinct a thing from the mind understanding and conscience it shines in and as little essential to it as the candle is respectively from and to the dark room wherein it shines but this that god by his light within shews something of himself to all is not much denied by you nor are ye easily perswaded by us but that all that is but natural still but ye deny light in common to all coming from christ and his spirit which though have shewed so plainly above from iohn

where christ is said by his spirit to have strove with and preached to the spirits in prison in the world of old to convince the world and enlighten every man in it and the gospel to be preached in every creature yet a word more with you here as to this let us see how far your selves confess to it and deny it

confesses page
pamp or at least denies not the gentiles to have been enlightned by christ as god before his coming in that body at ierusalem but it seems denyes he did or does enlighten all as christ and sings much what to the same tune with him ex

saying nihilnon naturale nihil spirituale nihil specialiter a christo mediatore emanans communicatum no light that's spiritual none but what is natural flowing or no light shining out from christ as mediator nothing but what men yet destitute of all saving knowledge of him may have without christ and apart from him is mentioned rom
and ex

christus sub nulla christ in no case hath vouchsafed saving light to all and every man in all which sayings seems to confess with that god indeed and perhaps christ as god may vouchsafe to all lucis cuasdam scintillulas reliquias nonnullas primitivae lucis as he diminutively speaks some relikes of the first light man was lost from some small sparks of light to all men but these are but meerly natural neither supernatural spiritual nor saving or sufficient to bring men however heeding them to any saving knowledge of god but as for christ as christ the mediator between god and man there's nothing no light at all that's saving or by the best improvement of which that can be made they can possibly come to salvation by him so much as vouchsafed by him to all or to any but some elect ones
yea ex

that christ doth not indue and savingly enlighten all and every man but some only that is the elect with that divine light in respect of which we confess him to be the light of the world and consequently of al men is so ascertain'd from innumerable testimonies of scripture

and the experience of all ages that he must even be blind and destitute of all spiritual understanding that shall once dream to the contrary and
lumen hoc utcunque ei attendatur non est ullo respectu salutare sed in divinis finem ultimum quod attinet meraetenebrae caecitas this light howsoever attended to is in no respect saving but in all divine things as to the utmost end meer darknesse and blindnesse it self thus these men and the same in effect is asserted by and as will appear more by and by

must therefore down rightly address my self as the lord shall lead me not minding the method so much as the matter it self to reply to all this stuffe whereby and in speciall who as generals to other blind guides of poor blind people against the qua strive to storm the plain truth out of dores
and to evince it that some measure of that true spiritual and if attended to and improved saving light and grace in respect of which he is said to be the light and saviour of the world which is spiritual light for in the same senses men are said to be darkness are they enlightened quoth but without controversie the men the spirit speaks of iohn
were not naturally blind but spiritually darkness is vouchsafed and shines from christ as christ the mediator between god and man even to all and every man in it
first shall follow on in the way was going on in to clear it that christ as christ the light of the world by his light and spirit and not as god only enlightens every one in the proof of which the rest is all concluded though yet may grow on to take notice of the rest in particular also
and first shall minister the truth to you from that text which you ministers against the truth do so mangonize among you as to make neither more nor lesse then just as many meanings of as ye are men for between you four there are four senses put upon it whereof though some of them in terminis are true enough to serve truths turn against you yet as ye mince your matter in the minds and as ye mean and wrest your own true words as well as the text it self the wrong way there is never a one of all four that falls fully upon the white
that text is iohn
that was the true light which enlightens every man coming into the world

that the true light here spoken of is christ and the light that comes from him which iohn baptist a shining light in his season but inferiour to him was not but only bare testimony to in whom is life and whose life is the light of men that shineth in that darkness which comprehends it not and so consequently not a naturall stuens expiis naturae much lesse as natural to man as his intellect mind and conscience it self as sayes that light which all have is ex

lumen est naturalis propria niseparabilis mentis conscientiae vis efficazia eculus and yet
light is not eyes acies est
st lumen hoc non naturale neque intellectus neque mens neque conscientia homin naturalis est and insufficient but a spirituall supernaturally and all sufficient light to save all ch in whom it is in case they believe in it is a truth which as it is

undeniable in it self so never yet met with any minister or other that was so deeply darkened as to deny yea positively affirmeth it to my hands ex

lucem illuminationem quarum hic loci mentio facta est spirituales esse ad renovationem gratiae non naturales atque ita ad creationem pertinere apparet
it appears that the light and illumination mentioned john
are spirituall and pertaining to the renewing of grace not natural and pertaining to the creation so that were there as little as there is much to be said beside all those particulars if the universality of it hold but as well from the latter part of the verse stand proved without any more ado the question then which alone we are concerned to enquire into is whether this light which as sayes ex

non est salutare cum sit naturale so contrary non est salutare cum sit salutare be so common to all that every man that cometh into the world be enlightned with it in some measure yea or no

now we have the expresse words of the spirit on our side and are sure enough as to our selves that we have the mind of christ in them also which is but one but on their side are their own senses minds and meanings which are so many even no lesse then four to that one of ours which most properly answers to the words so that if they can't carry it by weight yet they hope to have it by number and chuse to us since they see they cannot us hoping that several senses may well stand and take place against one single one but as a dram of honesty and naked simplicity is to go further then a deal of subtilty and hypocrisie in the dayes that are coming so one of the qua proper constructions of scripture will be preferred by honest people before a improper one of the priests imposing the qua are in possession of the plain terms of the place and of that meaning which most properly answers to them saying that by every man coming into the world is intended honestly and plainly truly and properly without dissimulation every man indeed as tis there expressed and that the spirit meanes nakedly and truly what he sayes these stand proking pelting and stickling with a company of stones and sticks and strawes to storm the qua out of the strong hold they have in it

as for he lets fly out of the devils bow in which he shoots which hath unstringed and enervated not a little as to many false matters of fact he charges the qua with by his discharging at them out of it no lesse then three severall senses or senseless shafts viz two and one
of his pamph every of which has truth in it as to the termes he utters himself in but so false as he pinchingly intends by by his own words that all three of them put together do not reach far enough to make up the whole truth that is there intended and so by short shooting he loses all
his first sense is this viz
that christ enlightens every man that is enlightened

repl
so say that makes for us that is every man without exception for thus argue shooting back ds arrows against himself who overshot himself in one sense as much when he gives this sense to that place in his words by which he gives us the cause as in his minde he undershoots

the truth in another for he meanes not by them though his phrase imports it that every individual man is inlightned

christ enlightens every man that is enlightned
but every individual man is enlightned
therefore christ enlightens every individuall man

the first proposition is ds own the minor viz
that every man is enlightned with some light is his own grant also where he sayes we grant that every man hath some light by which he discernes many sins and duties and several divine attributes so that let his meaning be what it will if he meanes as he sayes as it is fit he and and every honest man should and as the spirit does we have his own words as well as those of the text on our side also against himself therefore if he own himself must of all men own the conclusion viz that christ enlightens every individuall man

whether saw any advantage he had given us by this sense thus expressed or no it matters not but expressing his mind as to the interpretation of this text there he adds a clause by which he imagines he mends the matter and so he does as much as one that makes it never the better for there he shoots out his sense thus that christ enlightens every man who is spiritually enlightned
repl
which is very true yea so say again but this arrow does no execution against us nor that universal sense in which we expound the words according to the universality of their expression of which it is no way at all exclusive for what though christ enlightneth every man that is spiritually inlightned it doth not follow unless had said as its like he meanes but that his sayings and meanings so seldome agree together that he measures the spirit also by himself as saying one thing and meaning another and so would set the spirits words and the spirits meanings at odds and together by the eares against themselves christ enlightens only such men as are spiritually inlightned
nor secondly if he had said so would it have followed that every individual man is not enlightned for of a truth every individuall man is not only enlightned but also spiritually enlightned for he that is enlightned to discern spiritual things good or bad spiritual wickednesses or spiritual righteousness many sins and duties and divine attributes which are all spirituall objects and some of them some of those things of the spirit which the meer natural man without the spirits revealing cannot know because they are spiritually discerned that man must be spiritually enlightned so out of a better bow then the devils even that of iosephs which abides in strength shoot back ds second arrow again thus against himself as that which hath done us no harm howbeit he meant it otherwise it being in his mind to have mischief'd the truth viz christ enlightens every man that is spiritually enlightned witness t:d but every individuall man is more or lesse even spiritually inlightned to discern spiritual objects which by the spirits revealing them only and not naturally but spiritually only or by the spirit are to be discerned witness t:d again therefore christ inlightens every individuall man

who hath mostly two hath here a third string to his bow left the two first should not hold from which he shoots thus viz
he enlightens some of every nation kindred tongue and people as the phrase is rev

repl
and this however he meanes pinchingly yet is true too in terminis that christ enlightens some every where a number in all nations as he expresses it over again
for the termes all and every one are conclusive continually of some but that arrow reaches not far enough to wound our universal construction so long as the termes some a number many without a but put to them whereby to bolt out othersome which is wanting here though elsewhere added and by and by to be talkt with is not exclusive of all men of every man nor of any man and so his bow and bolts shoots too short to hit the butt still nor is the phrase rev which in his fancy fellows and identifies with this in iohn like it in any wise for one is enlightens every man in the world the other redeemed us out of every nation were it redeemed every man in every nation and made every man in every nation and kindred a king a priest to god then it had been somewhat a kin to it indeed
thus by his single self with all his sharpest shafts or sorry shifts can make nothing stick to the gaining of any ground against us nor so much as to stirre us a hairs breadth from our interest in it much lesse to storm us out of the strong hold we have in that high place of scripture wherein the qua stand over the head of the serpent to the bruising of it let us see sith vis unita fortior what the joyned forces of him and together can do for they two who fight as under from that text in some of their several senses against the qua fall in together in one of their four or five senses even that which hath the least sense and reason in it of all the rest and so of two make one most senselesse head against the qua and the text and the truth or true sense of the spirit no lesse plainly imported and implyed to any but that darkness which comprehends not the true light when it shines in it then it is plainly end evidently exprest therein
that sense shall joyn issue in against them both at last but there lies on single sense of wherein joyns not with him wherewith shoots out of the same bow as hard as he can against us though too short to hit or hurt us the which must be shot back again upon himself first in the service of the qua and the truth which it serves perfectly while not at all themselves nor their own false doctrine and then shall have the more to fight them both in about the other

the sense of which is not only his own neither though appears not to own it with him for have seen others besides as himself seeking to shuffle off the truth with it is this viz christ coming into the world inlightens every man and this sense seems to be ushered in with a deal of and ceremony as if was confident of carrying the cause by it when it first center'd within his conciet and so intended to act his triumph over the qua before his effecting of the victory shall set down some of his triumphant matter wherein he marches on towards the text

where he meets us and make some occasionall notes on some crosse whets to himself and halts and he makes by the way

i.o porro quid contra garriunt fanatici ut que operam dent quacum ratione aliqua insanire videantur ex

they never make a more horrid then when they come upon this place here they fain wonderfull triumphs to themselves and not a little cast ignominy on their adversaries
repl
no otherwise say still do we reproach then as the virgin of sion isai

and thanks be to god who alwayes maketh us thus to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place which ye doctors and divines cloud and darken with your dry divinity for we are unto god though a stink to your unsavory selves a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish through their hatred of the light that enlightens every of without an illumination by which there were undefined span alphabet to them for rejection of it neither are we as the many that and deal about the word of god for their own self ends but as of sincerity as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ
they say that scripture speaks of christ he therefore is the light christ is the light and moreover be inlighteneth not this and that man only but every man that comes into the world that is all men and every individual of them neither could anything be affirmed more clearly
repl
neither could it in truth but that the selfish seers are all blind and its unto them so that they cannot divine
that the scriptures are to be interpreted extorsimus we have enforced it from own adversaries

do thou say extorsimus we have wrested it from them by force how own the interpretation of the script which is no way of any procure interpretation may be interpreted by the same publick spirit of

god that gave it forth and by those that open it in the light of that spirit yet we never yielded it to you yet nor never shall that the scripture is to be opened by that dark private narrow selfish sottish spirit of satan that in you lusts to envy against the truth nor by that fallible spirit that ye are searching the scripture and preaching out of it by who your selves deny any man as is above shewed to be in these dayes guided by any infallible direction of the infallible spirit of god for that fallible spirit of yours which leads you into as many meanings on it well nigh as ye are men that meddle with it and more too sometimes one man putting two or three senses as doth and two men no lesse then four between them as i.o and on one text does but make such a nose of wax of the scripture as may be and is too whereby ye may see what a steady rule ye have of the letter without the light turned and twined by every of you into his own turn till as the picture that every passenger had liberty with a pensil to mend what he thought and fancied to be amisse in it as he passed by at last became a mishapen monster so the scripture is scrued into such a multiformity of mens monstrous meanings that he must be monstrously blinded indeed within a while who will not see a necessity of a more stable standard to measure truth by then a transient much mistranscribed much more mistranslated most infinitely misinterpreted text letter or outward writing can ever possibly be which more stable standard is that of the infallible light and spirit not as judges it must needs be if not the letter that pretended unerring popes breast and bosome and his infallible chair


the sense of this place comes now in question

christ is light to wit in the same sense in which we have shewed god is light he is light in respect of his essentiall majesty holiness and glory also he is light quatenus as he is the fountain author and cause of all light that is essentially and efficienter as the efficient of it

christ is said to be the light of men not that light which is in men he is the cause of all light not all light not that accidental and corrupt light whereof we speak
repl
yes hear all manner of people who is so blind but himself who is in suis tal as not to see how gives up his cause by the way while he is but upon his triumphant march toward the text before he touches it whereabout the pitcht battel is to be
the grand question about which his quarrell with the is is whether christ as an efficient doth enlighten all men yea or nay

that all men have some light are in some measure enlightaed within themselves to discern sins duties divine attributes moral good and evill the things of god and themselves this is not denied but abundantly affirmed by and specially who oft o're and o're tell us of a voice of god by which he speaks so in all men that there is no need of other witness to evince it that its god that speaketh by which he reveals his will and that obedience which from us is eternally indispensably due to him and abuudance more id genus as abovesaid then is fit or needfull here to be only the case sticks here whether this come from god only or from christ also as god alone but as the true light of the world whether christ be the efficient

fountain author cause of this universal light that is confessed to be in common in all men without exception of any unlesse infants and naturall fools

we say yea christ the true light of the world is the cause of all that whereby anything of god is to be known by them that is at all in any or all men

t.d i.o say no such matter they'l fight with us before they'l yield to that that christ as the cause enlightens all men and we stand upon iohn
out of that strong hold draws nigh in a very audacious daring way to storm us but behold as in other cases in ipso lumine he stumbles at the threshold before he euters the garrison where our guard is he yields falls down and flatly consesses tis so as we say in words which are his owns christus lux est eodem sersu quo deum lucem esse demonstravimus christ is light in the same sense as we have shewed god is light

how is that thou mayest read it reader abundantly in os where he shews how god enlightens speaks in shews himself and will and their duty even to all men in their own hearts and consciences
but what sayes he here expresly thus as god so christ is light not only essentialiter in regard of his own majesty holiness glory but efficienter also quatenus omnis lucis sons as he is the fountain author and cause of all light he is the light of men that is the cause of all light so then before he comes to the fight upon the place sides with us against and his fellow so farre as in effect to argue thus viz christ is the cause of all light there is none but what he is the efficient author and fountain of from whence it comes
but there is some light in every individuall man therefore that light which is in and where with every individual man is enlightned is from christ as the efficient cause fountain and author of it and this is like ds confession that christ enlightens every man that is enlightned at all which is no lesse then to all men without exception

thus far hath confessed and fail'd in his way to the attempt and he had as good have lain still where he lay as up again and fall yet up again he gets to the text itself and from that he assaults us more blindly and in the dark on this fashion
non dicitur christum
it is not said that christ enlightneth every man coming into the world but that he coming into the world enlightens every man for which sense besides the latine tongue he all along assaults the qua in he repeats it o're in greek also

rep itane is it so indeed as thou sayest will it hold and carry itself clearly in thy own conscience and singly as in the fight of god when thou readest the words in that order wherein in the very greek they stand in the text without shuffling and twinkling that the particle coming must relate to that word and substantive that is furthest of all from it in the text i.e to to and not to that which it immediately follows and is joyned to not only in order of place but of construction to panta that thou so positive and peremptory in putting that drossy guilded gloss upon that scripture do

not deny but that erchomenon eis ton cesmon if it stood as neer to to phos as it does to panta anthropon might as to the syntax as well agree with that as its evident by the placing of it it rather now agrees with the other were it en to phos to erchomenon eis ton photizei pava anthropon as it is panta anthropon
would say more then will now in way of yielding to thy meer will which thou standst for more then truth in this matter howbeit even then as thou shalt see by and by unless thou wilt still shut thy eyes thou wouldst not have the strength of a straw more by it toward thy cause but as now it is summon thee from the lord god and in his name and fear to read it o're once more solemnly as in his sight and fear before thou have run thy full career yet into condemnation and see whether it sway not that way we say and be not cogent in thy own conscience to the very contrary as to the construction thou makest of it being perswaded that if prejudice have not already blinded thee well nigh perfectly to thy perdition that thou wilt rather consent to the sense wherein all translators that ever read of that text into the english tongue at least and expositors too unless some two or three who with thy self in these dayes have happened to find and insist upon that silly sense and conceited crotchet against the qua do as one man agree to render it against thee and with the qua viz
that was the light which enlightneth every man coming or every man that cometh into the world and if thou wilt be so blind and obstinate as in thy malice against the truth and qua to withstand the whole current of translators and commentators whom thou canst not but commend above thy self as believe not one of an hundred of those schollars that are yet eminity to the will do with thee for all that esteem thou stand in for one among them yet what wilt thou get by the busness when all is done wilt thou gain one grain of ground against us by it if we should give and grant thee to read it thy own wrested way as we will not nay verily though thou hast got nothing by thy naming of such a thing but disadvantage to thy self many wayes yet we as thou shalt see who will loose as little as thou getrest as to the cause in hand shall improve it to our advantage against thee more wayes then one or then thou who mostly makest more hast then good speed well aware of and indeed as men that meddle to mend old kettles that are fit for nought do oft instead of stopping one hole make two so hast thou by medling this way to mend thy bad matter against the qua made more work for thy patching self so that with all thy and thinking thou wilt never fasten thy tackling which thou hast loosed by it so well but that at last it will all drop to pieces

for first let it be noted down upon the score before all the world how this rather then he will not maintain his malicious ends against the qua and the rich gospel of gods grace and true doctrine of the universality of it held out by them from god not in pretence dissimulation and mockage as themselves do saying god offers life to all but intends it only to a few but in truth will maintain that the translators most if not every one of them that have translated the scripture into english for the use of poor people have done not only ignorantly and blindly but abusively

also to the text and to this whole nation to this day for if there be one english bible throughout the nation that reads it otherwise then thus as the qua read that text viz
the true light which enlightens every man coming or that comes into the world let him that doubts go look it here profess never saw any of our translations which were done by as wise heads as i.o that ever englisht it his way

he disparages the grave doctors and commentators that himself so much accounts on for hae who reads and expounds as does vel duo vel some two or none but none that ever saw of any either or modern expositors of any nore or credit among themselves

and so still he preaches it out how by the doctors scribes and scriblers about the scripture the poor people and rich too of the nation that understand and greek are abused nosed gulled and befooled being fain to be of that faith still about the scripture and sense of the scripture it self which is their rule of faith as their fathers are of believing as they do at rome as their church alias clergy believes who if they happen to be out as they seldome in unless out be in with them as in is out with the people whose eyes all as of one man should be as the true israels are zach
toward the lord being towards their spiritual lordships the clergy do all as one man erre after them and drop together in gross with their blind guides into the ditch and whereas all have hitherto following the old interpreters who say the truth with the read that text thus the true light enlightens every man that comes into the world they if i.o may have his will against the qua must now read otherwise


suppose we should for tryals sake and no otherwise will we grant thee that the greek text in respect of the words as they may be construed may equally bear os construction as well as that of the qua and of most or all translators and interpreters hitherto does not this then overturn the whole business thou so much buslest for throughout thy book viz the greek and hebrew texts being such a sure fixt steady stable infallible unchangeable inalterable rule canon measure standard for all truth to be tryed by and all spirits lights even that infallible one which gave it out as well as any other the infallible guidance of which thou deniest to be now in the world or to be the stable rule standard or direction about doctrines duties for verily if it be so as in some places it is by me to be so far more clearly then in this viz iob
where ereunate may be read either indicatively as a complaint ye search the scriptures and look for life there which is christs mind there or imperatively as a command search ye that one and the same phrase in the greek may bear constructions from which being differently construed according to mens meer different conceits upon them may arise not only various and senses such as gives when he sayes it is either of else perhaps it may be so and the word or phrase may import so and may so up and down in his book but also such as are even contradictory and absolutely destructive one to another must not he then out the eyes of men first that makes them believe that which contends and spends himself throughout his whole book about that not the

light spirit word and truth of christ in the hearts and consciences of men nor any immediate vision or revelation of the old inalterable infallible eternal will and truth of god to man in his own heart as he waits at wisdomes gates at gods own mouth for counsell is to be the rule but such an uncertain doubtful fallible flexible thing as an external text and letter that may be and is turned twenty wayes and made to stand even in one verse many wayes at once according as men in their foolish vain thoughts are minded to thrust it art thou so benummed and hardened against this truth that the light is the rule and not the letter that because the quakers rell it thee against whom thou art risen in wrath therefore thou wilt not believe it no not though preached to thee by thy own mouth hand and pen as well as theirs quid cum iis agamus qui cum revera sintadeo infeliciter stupidi ut nulla neque ratione neque experientia erudiri possint quasi tamen ipsi soli superent vanaperswasione siderati in contemptu eorum quae non intelligunt audaciter persistunt atque cum comicoillo clamant dicat quad quisque volet nos exhae opinione non dimo vebimur ex
read that to thy self if thou canst tell how and see how thou loosest thy ground against us one way while thou seekest to gain against us another way by thy extortion of the text and thy playing legerdemane about the letter


suppose we should as for tryals sake again we will not otherwise for our nay is stronger then thy tea as to this place give thee thy own reading of that text wholly to thyself jet's see what thou canst make of it against the lights enlightning every man which is the thing thou denyest and wouldest disprove by it nempe to pan hoc est vere nihil just as much and not a jot mere then thou had before if thou wilt not read it the true way it then in thy own and make thy best on'r the true light coming into the world enlightens every man here is thy reading which amounts not to one attome more against every mans being enlightned with the true light then if thou quietly without quarrelling with the quakers read'st it with them thus the true light enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world for it still proves that every man in the world since the true lights coming into it is enlightned by it and all that thou thyself concludest and entailest at the end of thy tale about it is no more then an exclusion of that part of the world that died before christs fleshly coming into it from being mentioned in this text for so run the words of thy conclusion ex

ad maximam ideo partem humani generis quaescilicet ante adventum christi in mundum fato functa fuerit non pertinet haec assertio
therefore to the greatest part of mankind namely such as died before christs coming into the world this assertion appertains not

repl
in which assertion of thine thou according to the manner of errour which is a that when men are once in it sucks them in further art sunk more over head and eares then before considering thy meaning of thy own words for how beit if rightly understood there are no men that ever lived or died in the world who had a being in it before christ and the true light of the world or word of which it is said iohn
it was in the beginning with god and was god and as god is not

denyed by any of you to have enlightened all men from of old before that juncture ye count from and by which men and all things were made so that without it not any thing was made that was made in which was the life which life was the light of men which shineth in the darkness even the wicked who are yet darkness though not comprehended thereby
yea to the wisdome of god cor
that leads men in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of iudgement that it may cause those that love it to inherit substance and fill their treasures was the very beginning of gods way was set up from everlasting and in being when the heavens and earth were founded and established rejoycing in the habitable parts of the earth and delighting in and lightning the sons of men ever since there were men and blessing those that attended to him prov to the end and in all ages entering into holy souls made them friends of god and the prophets wisd
and so thy fancy and falsity falls to the ground who speakest as if christ as christ the wisdom of god and true light of the world did not enlighten any before that sun as thou speakest or appearance of him in that flesh that died at ierusalem for he was in the being of a true light to the world though slain as a lamb in men from the very foundation thereof and such as walk'd in the beames of that which came from him came up to the sight of his day and glory with rejoycing as abraham and others did isai
and was the christ or anointed one of god to the doing of his work and shewing of his will in the world before any letter was written of him and before he assumed to himself that outward appearance wherein he died or else how did moses suffer the reproach of christ in his dayes who lived so long afore that body ye only know him in was born and how did christ preach by his spirit in noahs dayes if there was no christ then come pet and was the same light that he now is to the world and so it is said in the text thou so much talkest on but that thou readest it at randome as thou dost the rest for its said that was the true light in praeterito which enlightneth in presents every man that cometh into the world that which was the light before his coming in that flesh that is the light which now enlighteneth as it did then every man and that that it was it ever will be on kai en kai erchomenos rev
he that before then was come and then came and is come and comes and is to come from the beginning to the end the first and last the light of men and life of such as will be lead by him to it the only way for all that have life to walk in whose light all they that hate love death

yet if it were so as god forbid for then what became of not only the rebellious part of the world but of abell enoch noah abraham isaac iacob were it so as thou sayest that to the greatest part of mankind to wit that whole part so thy words import that died before christs coming into the world which thou countest but from the period of some one thousand six hundred years upward this saying that the true light enlightens them relates not wonder what light thou deemest then they were enlightened by if not the true light for god is the true light and the spirit is the true light and if thy letter were the true light which it rather only came from yet those who lived before that had it not or were they enlightned with any accidental false corrupt light for such a one thou

speakest of in the foregoing section saying christus est lux non ill accidentalis corrupta de qua loquimur christ is light not that accidental corrupt light of which we speak where if by we thou meanest thyself and thy fellows tell us what light that is but if thou mean thyself and the quakers what e're thou speakest of know no such monster as a corrupt light that the qua either own or speak of for they own and know no other light whatever may falsly pretend to that name of light then that which is pure uncorruptible and uncorrrupted


however if no man till about one thousand six hundred years ago were enlightened by christ the true light yet it's enough for us that thou grantest every man to be enlightned by christ the true light since that time let them before stand or fall to their own master the quakers call men to that light they are now enlightened withall and that every man is enlightened by his coming into the world at that time thou affirmest from the text taken thy own way and dost not hitherto in thy own interpretation of it deny though afterward thou denyest it with a witness and t.d too who witnesse both to that same false upon the text before hinted at and now to come under consideration and it is this ex

he horum verborum sersus est cum omnes homines essent merae tenebrae tois quoth i.o is the sense of these words when all men were meer darkness and blind to heavenly things the son of god the eternal word the eternal light coming into the world sent the holy spirit to enlighten some of these men that were by nature darkness and so was made the light of them

sundry of which call aloud for a rod of as rough reproof as the rest have had for the backs of both tombs and baxter among which shall here hint at no more then that of in his epistle concerning iame nayler which as he sayes is regardable and so say to bs shame who so basely belyes iames nayler therein representing those words at large wherein i.n renounces those unclean spirits that are gone out to the dishonour of god by many wild actions from the unity of the truth and light into which the qua are called gathered and in which they abide as if therein had written a recantation of all that ever he wrote against baxter and others for the truth held out by the qua and as if had for ever renounced the qua as unclean spirits and ranters and such like when as its most evident to any but the blind that as still iustifies the truth and light and all the qua that abide in it and to which by the grace of god he now stands a true and faithful servant so that his recantation and renunciation is of no other then of that old spirit of the ranters which makes head against the light of christ condemning filthiness in every conscience and life of the cross which however many may turn away from as they did of old yet many thousands of qua continue walking in to this day

but say passing by all and gross abusiveness of this sort against the qua of that vniversal light and sufficient or saving grace of god to all which the qua testifie to they assert thus bax ep their great pretence when they dishonour the scripture and the ministry is to lead men to a light or word of god within and this is their cry in our assemblies and our streets hearken to the light and word within you and the sufficiency of this they clamorously defend and grievously for contradicting them
so out of the principles of those men viz pelagians arminians these people meaning the qua have drawn their tenet of an vniversal light in every man that cometh into the world without bibles preachers christian ordinances to know his duty so as that he may be perfect which is indeed the reviving of old pelagianism or worse and tends to the making of christian religion if not all religion whatsoever unnecessary

sol by way of complaint against the qua they say this is their conceit that every man that cometh into the world even the gentiles that have not the letter yet have from christ a spiritual light
that every one hath a light within him or there is such revelation imparted to

every man in the world that if he would use it he might come to saving knowledge this vniversal light is so magnified by fox that he tells us it shews all the ungodly wayes that ever a man hath acted in with it a person will come to see christ the saviour of his soul from whence the light comes to save him from his sin it brings to christ to confess him gives the knowledge of the god of the world that rules in them that are disobedient this light gives the knowledge of the glory of god the true knowledge of the scriptures its one in all they that come to and love it come into fellowship one with another out of this they are in jarrs and confusions it lets see sin that hath separated from god and the mediator and the kingdome of heaven and lets men see they must be meek and humble keeps from errour guile all distraction distemper drunken thoughts imaginations and a mans own reasonings its the gospel the first principle of pure religion they that profess to believe the scriptures in god in christ yet believe not in this light deny christ and though they profess some of christs and the apostles words yet none confess christ but who confess the light that they who teach not this are teachers of the world antichrists deceivers the letter i.e scripture is not the light nor the word more to the same purpose is say they and truly enough say delivered by hubberthorn and many more insomuch that saith loving the light it will guide you to god from all men that ye need never look at man more

and page
they i.e qua assert that there is a light in every man that this is sufficient to guide them to god of it self that it is a rule to shew duty and sin that there need no other teaching of man that this is one in all that it is the gospel
this is the main prop of the new antichristian religion or frenzy of the qua
by all which its plain that these four do as one man withstand and resist this truth the qua testifie concerning the general love and grace of god in christ iesus to all mankind i.e every individual man in their above cited sayings so far as to give them all any such measure of saving light as puts them but into a possibility for life if they never so well improve it and the universality of a light in men sufficient to save them or which is all one the sufficiency of that light to save from sin which is asserted by the qua to be in some measure given by christ universally to all men

shall therefore address my self to a little farther examination of what the scriptures declare for and our four divines against the truth of god in these particulars whose oppositions of it are much what from the same grounds and those no other then the same that are made use of by all personal electionists to push at that precious doctrine of the general love of god to the whole world in vouchsafing some measure of no less then truly saving grace universally to all and every individual in it or of light sufficient to lead to life such as follow it to each particular person among mankind so that not any perish for want of the love of god and christ to them or of willingness in god and christ to have them saved or of true strivings of their holy spirit with them to draw them from the way of death or of light sufficient to lead them out of that darkness that destroyes them or of power and saving grace given them from god to work

out their own salvation or of christ the saviours dying for them and offering himself a ransome for every one as well as any one or of sufficiency in him to save such as come to god by him or of true tender of life peace and reconciliation with god to him or of true purpose and intent in god and christ to receive them to mercy on condition of their repentance or of space given them to repent in and return or upon the account of any particular personal pdestination or of them to condemnation per saltum peremptorily inalterably before they were born without reference had to impenitency in ungodliness foreseen or upon any such like considerations as our divines hold forth but meerly through their own slighting of that love resistings of the foresaid strivings despising of the riches of that grace and forbearance refusing to be led to repentance by that light and by it to come to that saviour from whom it comes not turning at the reproofs of it not improving the said gift of the power of god and manifestation of the spirit given to profit withall not putting themselves forth according to the measure of it in them but receiving it in vain not trading with the talent but trifling away the acceptable time the day of gods salvation the day given to them wherein the lord would hear and succour them not minding therein the things that make for their peace till hid from their eyes these and such like as fall out only on mans part who remains in the enmity when god is in christ reconciling not imputing trespasses to the world but as the world goes on obstinately therein destroying themselves whilst in god still is or was their help nevertheless whether they hear or forbear live or die be saved or damned are the sole causes of mens destruction and perdition who perish not at all according to the will of god desiring it should be so if salva veritatis voluntatis immutabilitatis justitiae gloria without violation to his iustice truth and purely good and immutable will which is that the godly shall prosper and the ungodly perish it may be otherwise though yet permitting it so to be when there is no remedy

chap iii
and this that christ died for all men without exception and god in him intends salvation to all as truly willing they should have it rather then not if in their own obstinate wills they withstand it not by refusing to return when he draws them as he truly tenders it to them and hath of his own free love and grace impowered them as well to receive it if they will as to reject it if they will and vouchsafed them all some measure though not the same measure of the true light which is sufficient to guide all that follow on to know him in it to that saving knowledge of himself and christ which is life eternal is from the whole scope of scripture as certain to him who is not blinded with that sorcerer that could not see the sun as tis that sayes falsly the contrary is certain from innumerable places of it out of which argue in proof of the foresaid truths as followeth

argum

if it were so certain as these men say tis by their spokesman ex

that god doth not savingly enlighten all and every man but some only i.e the elect that he must be blind and void of all spiritual understanding that dreames to the contrary and that christ in no wise vouchsafes saving light to all and every man nor any measure of that that is sufficient to save men let them attend to it never to well

then he could not say truly and honestly without a lye

that this wayes are equall and as he lives he had rather the wicked should turn from his wickedness and live then die in and for it fith he might in a way of consistency with the unchangeableness of his unchangeable decree concerning the death of finall impenitents put them at least into a capableness to chuse life and possibility to come to it if they would as well as to chuse death if they would and thereby have shewed the equally of his wayes in letting men have what they will and as they do yet would not do so much for them as that

but most certain tis that gods wayes are all most equall so as to let men have from him what they chuse viz
life and good and blessing in christ the light or death and evil and the curse in the deeds of darkness when both are set before them deut isai and as certain tis that god so sayes as abovesaid and truly wishes rather that the wicked even those that do die should turn and live as else they cannot but that they will not mark ezek throughout and ezek to

and whatever god sayes or wishes he doth it truly and honestly meaning as he sayes and is not such an hypocrite lyar and dissembler as ds doctrine of his tendring what he never intends
doth make him

therefore he vouchsafeth to all and every man even those that come to perish but that they neglect it at some time or other same measure of saving grace and a light sufficient to lead them to salvation
arg if god did not give at one time or other to all men such grace liberty light and power as is sufficient to bring them to life if they will chuse the life and well improve that light and power to the working out of their salvation when he bids them by it then god could not to all men render life by his ministers nor say work out your own salvation chuse life that ye may live else my soul shall chuse your greater destruction without mocking of men in in their misery before that time wherein he sayes he will only may justly mock at their calamity which is only when they have filled up their measure of scorning at him set at nought all his counsel and utterly rejected his reproof prov si enim lumen seu gratiam salutarem suam dare omnibus deus nolit tamen omnes ad salutem pervenire sub poena requirit quid ni per talem gratiam millies mille miseros homunciones ludos facere absit blasphemia est nay nor yet without horrible cruelty absurdity and for as much as it is no lesse then absurdity meer mockage and cruelty for a prince to say to a condemned helplesse malefactor that is lock'd up in chains ready to be led away to execution without affording him sufficient help so to do and with much threatening of so much the worse torture and pain in his death if he do it not would not at all that thou shouldst dye chuse rather to live shake off thy chains run from thy guard that leads thee save thy self and here is a pardon for thee but if thou dost not take this my counsel thou shalt be tenfold more severely executed yea it is against the very nature of choice to lay two things before a man saying chuse which of these two thou wilt and yet leave him under a necessity of taking the worst and put him into no possibility of taking the other but rather lay it utterly out of his reach so that he must needs have the worst or neither such choice as the proverb is is no other then hobson's choice which is chuse whether thou wilt have this or none

but it is certain that god speaks in such wise as aforesaid by his ministers to men and it cannot be denyed by your selves unless you deny your own doctrine for ye usually preach so in his name to all men yea could the whole world to use t.ds phrase in his ep pamph be brought in the reach of your voices ye would offer salvation to them all as much as ye seem to your selves to know that god intends it only to a few and would say we as ambassadours from god set life and death before you chuse life that ye may live god would not have you die why will you die work out your own salvation though ye falsly believe he hath wrought but in a few a sufficient light grace and power to will and de what ye calls them to turn your selves and live here is plenteous redemption for you else if ye do not this call warning tender fair proffer shall be to you but the sorer condemnation and yet god neither is

nor absurd nor cruell nor a mocker of men in their misery by his ministers till they have utterly set at nought all his councel and finally rejected his reproof

therefore god hath undoubtedly vouchsafed a measure of his saving grace and power and a light sufficient to lead them to life if they use well improve they follow eight power and grace to all and every man

if god have not sufficiently and savingly enlightned and impowred all and every man everywhere by such measure of that grace of his as may lead and enable them to act that repentance which is to life and salvation but some few only i.e the elect which according to your principles too are scarce one of a thousand in the world then he not only requires and commands utter impossibilities from most men but also judges and punishes them most severely yea eternally for the not doing of that in their own persons which he knows they neither can nor in their own persons ever could do for asmuch as sub poena iudicii on pain of iudgement and condemnation at the great day of it by christ he now at least commandeth all men saith paul acts
even everywhere to repent and yet he knows that without him and his grace they can do nothing all their sufficiency to will and to do good must come from him and that his grace which in the least measure of it is sufficient for them and that he gath given but to very few though he requires of them that have it not to do what they only can do that have it and to give it to the most he never intends it

but god does not command from most men though utter impossibilities and require of them with such rigour as own pain of his doubling condemnation on them the doing of that in their own persons which he knows per se they neither can do nor ever could for this were utterly inconsistent with that tender mercy exceeding great love bowels of compassion and true good will which the spirit every where declares god heares to all mankind even in the fall to the world even in its enmity who proclaims peace reconciliation good will towards men an indefinite phrase aequivalent there to an universal incomparable love to the world though it perishes for hating that light that is come into them which he sends to save them see and mark luke

since if our dim divines doctrine were true that he gives not to all light and grace sufficient to lead and save them and arbitrium vel vel liberatum a liberty a power to chuse to will to do what he requires to work out their salvation as he sayes he does phil

of his own good will and pleasure to which only belongs the glory therefore and not unto us of the salvation so wrought out by us the case is clearly otherwise then sayes for men might be put at least in possibility of living by such

grace light and power if god had given it but he would not

and lastly this would make god like to or worse then pharoah himself whom he plagued for the cruelty and tyranny even a rigorous requirer of men with many and sore stripes yea on pain of his eternal wrath and vengeance to make bricks without any allowance at all of any straw fit for such a purpose an austere man a hard master a tyrannical as the idle unprofitable servant falsly represented him that looks to reap where he never sowed and to gather where he hath not strawed that calls on perill of perishing for ever for a crop of good works from those hearts wherein he never sowed the good seed of his own word fruits of the spirit from such souls into which he never sent his spirit from whence only they can grow up a walking in that light of the lord which is said to be given not to condemn them but that through it they might be saved under penalty of being condemned for not walking in it when yet not the least beam of that saving light was at all vouchsafed them but a light of another sort as our seers say which could never have served their so as to have saved them had they attended never so strictly to it but only gods turn against them so as to damn them further and leave them without excuse and excuse him in his condemning them finally a growing in that saving grace of god on pain of condemnation for turning it into wantonness and receiving it in vain which was never received at all by them because not at all given them of god from whom the most have nothing say our silly sophisters but a certain common insufficient to know god or do good by that accommodates them that have it in their hearts to serve god acceptably by it not at all and therefore not half so well as the stubble did the israelites to make brick withall which they gathered instead of straw which divinity of our divines yet howtrue soever they deem it is but a turning of gospel grace and truth upside down and is esteemed of him and his no better then dirt and potters clay and is utterly contrary to the wisdome of god in scripture which justifies him still as accepting every man according to what he hath or hath had and not expecting much lesse with rigour exacting of any man according to what from him he neither hath nor never had as requiring from men no otherwise then according to what is committed to them which is one talent some true saving light within at least even to him that hath least which if he be faithful in it though but a little shall lead and let him de iure into the masters joy if neglected shuts him out into the outer darkness yea god calls for no more from any man then improvement of his own money that he commits to him to trade with which money if every one put into the bank that the lord at his coming may receive but his own with the use thereof and increase in the same kind of grace that he freely gives he will never enter into judgement with them to condemnation
therefore undoubtedly god hath sufficiently and savingly enlightned and impowered all and every man every where by such measure of that grace of his as may lead and inable them to act that repentance which is to life and salvation

if god have not vouchsafed some measure of sufficient and saving light to all men then its either the children of the light that believe in it who have it not or else the children of the darkness that believe not in it but both they who believe in it and so are the children of it and they who believe not in it and are not the children of it have it that the first have it none do deny and that the second sort have it is most evident to all but such children of the night as neither believe what the letter sayes of nor what the light it self shews concerning it self within themselves sith iob
christ sayes to such as were not yet the children of it but of the darkness because though twas in them they were not believing in it but walking besides it in the deeds of darkness which it condemns while ye have the light walk in the light believe in the light that ye may be the children of it which that profoundly bottomlesly deep and groapably dark imagination which is os and ds who in their muddy minds make no difference between the lights being in men and mens being in it the kingdomes being in men mens being in it whereas it was in the pharisees who never came into it

there urged by them against the true lights enlightning all and every man which all must come to iudgement by and by cloudily confound these two so distinct businesses into one viz to have the light and to be the children of it saying with as great confidence as small consideration that to be a child of light is all one as to be a person that hath light in him to guide him so as to please god when as all the children of the darkness in which the true light is said to shine though the darkness viz os ds ts bs and other dark hearts comprehends it not ioh
have if not a letter without them yet which is more light in them to guide them to please god de iure and to tell them when they displease him de facto as the letter does not which shews men what they have done should de and be but no men as the light does what they have done do and are but the children of the light are not all that have the light in them for all men have it though ill men hate it and because it condemns the evil deeds they love and are loath to leave condemn it love the darkness more then it whereupon it is though as from god intentionally their salvation yet actually their condemnation iohn
but all and only those who are actually led and guided by it who are and walk in it as it is in them and as god is in it guiding them into the way that's in his sight and into fellowship and acquaintance with himself ioh
these say are the children of the light who are justified by it by whom also it is justified while the world condemn it who are condemned by it as wisdome is justified of her own children

therefore god hath undoubtedly vouchsafed some measure of sufficient light or saving grace to all men

arg
if any have not some measure at least of this saving light it must be either the reprobates that are rebellious against it or the heathen as ye call them who are in name christian in nature as heathenish as they which have not any letter without nor knowledge of christ iesus

after the flesh for yourselves who name the name of christ and so think ye are christians would deem your selves disparaged if we should say they have that light ye have not and ye cannot deny but true christians that obey it and depart from the iniquity it condemns must much more have the gift of saving light and grace if the rebellious have it

but the very rebellious though they improve it not and so dwell in a dry land and find not the green pastures the sheep of christ feed on who hear his voice yet have this gift of saving grace by christ the mediator received for them and vouchsafed to them by the leadings of which if they follow it they may come to witness the lord god dwelling in them psal
yea iob
if the rebels against the light had it not shining in them in that time in which that was spoken which as is generally judged was before any of your scripture was written they could not be said to rebell against it and beside to the rebellious and gainsaying people in israel god says what should or could have done more for them that have not done which he could not have said in the iudgment of reason it self as much as he had done for them in giving them an outward scripture if he had not vouchsafed them withall some measure of that light and grace which is only able to guide men that improve it to salvation for less then so much could not put them into so much as possibility of salvation for all their letter and in all reason he should have put them at least into a possibility of it by a grace sufficient if improved to bring them to it or else all he did for them beside was little worth or worse then nothing to them and he had not done enough on his own part toward their deliverance from damnation let them have put forth themselves never so far but rather that which according to your principles must unavoidably tend to their sorer condemnation but doing that and putting them by the gift of his own light grace and power into a capacity to work out their own salvation whether they would walk in that light or not walk in it improve that power gift of grace or not improve it he would be clear of their blood and their miscarriage on their own part and they perish on the score of their own putting the salvation of god far from them when he brought it nigh them and as he might truly say what could have done more then have done for them unless shall force them to live whether they will or no and so change my decree unchangeable which is to put men again by my grace by my son whom give to be my light to the nations and my salvation to the ends of the into a posse peccare and posse non at least

a liberty and power to abuse life or death when set the way of both before them and then leave them ad libitum to imbrace which they please so they in all reason could expect no more it being pitty enough to provide meat and set it before poor perishing men though one do not put it per force into their mouths when they are capable to feed themselves and if any when they are made videre meliora will deteriora sequi and needs take the wrong way which they know to be the worst and its end to be death when not only the right is shewed them but they will'd and wish't and enabled to

walk in it that they may live thereby as to be in potentia ad actum to have from the power to chuse life or death is grace enough to condemned men so to them that chuse to die no wrong is done fith volenti non sit injuria
besides the wisdome of god it self is said prov to call very scorners that delight in scorning fools that hate knowledge and love folly to turn at her reproof promising more and more to poure out her spirit on them and make known her words to them they hearkening to her reproofs who talks with them in their beds when they awake and by the way otherwise tis the turning away of the simple from her teachings not being without her teachings that slayes them

and as for the heathen how they have that which is to be known of god even enough as to their salvation manifest by god himself within them and not only the wrath of god against all their ungodliness but also the righteousness of god revealed from heaven even by him that speaks from heaven in their own hearts so that they both know god in some measure though not liking to retain the knowledge of him in them nor glorifying him as god answerably to what they know of him their foolish hearts are darkned and they given over to vileness but also know the iudgements of god that the things they do are worthy of death as also that life and peace from god should be to them in the contrary and so are condemned accused and without excuse when they sin as well as cleared accepted justified before god within themselves when they do well by the work of the law of god written in their hearts by which though they have not the law in letter or a literal copy of it as professors have whom they will iudge and be justified before for all the professors boasting if they do the things contained in the law as its written in their consciences and much more to this purpose is so clear to them that in the light with any solid understanding and not in their own benighted minds and prejudiced spirits against the true light which the letter points to read the first and second chap of paul to the romans thoroughout that all the objections to the contradicting of this truth we even thence plead against them made by our hasty opposers will appear to be but obulaty sticks and straws reeds and rushes when as anon we must we come to examine them therefore the premises well considered it will plainly appear that some measure at least of that saving light and grace which is sufficient to lead such as follow it unto life is vouchsafed to all and every man

arg
if christ the saviour and the salvation of god it self be a common salvation given in common to all and every man without exception so that all that will may have it then that sufficient saving light that leads to it and the gift of that grace of god that puts men into a power and possibility to work it out to themselves brings it to them and being not neglected but improved brings them to it must be given also in common to all and every man else it cannot be said properly they are in posse to it or so much as that they may have it but the salvation of god is freely given in common to all men so that every man who will may have it else god who means as he sayes and mocks not most men in such cruelty as to say to them whom he knows are lockt up so that they cannot come at it unless loosed by him who yet never intends to loose them here's salvation here's plenteous redemption

for all you sinners which would you should all have without respect of persons take it who will freely as tis freely tender'd else far greater vengeance shall fall on you then if had never been gracious to you for refusing my rich grace and goodness which would have had you enjoyed but you would not would not utter his mind with so many strong and serious asseverations complaints commands and seemingly compassionate by which to take all scruples away and put his great and true love to them out of doubt as he does saying

behold my servant a light to the nations to be my salvation to the ends of the earth
ho every one that thirsteth come ye unto the waters and he that hath no money come yea come and buy wine and milk without money and price

he hath laid help on one that is mighty who is able to save to the utmost all that come to god by him him that cometh unto me will in no wise cast out in the lord is compassion and with him is redemption
let the wicked forsake his way the unrighteous his thoughts and turn to the lord for he is gracious and to our god for he will abundantly pardon he is long suffering not willing any should perish but that all should come to repentance wills that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believeth in him may not perish but have everlasting life for he sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth shall not be condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he believeth not on the only begotten son of god
this is the gift that he hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son the light he that believeth not makes god a lyar because he believeth not the testimony god gives of his son in him is life and his life is the light of men and the light shineth in the darkness but the darkness comprehends it not he came a light into the world and the world knew him not
this is the true light which enlighteneth every man that comes into the world
glory be to on high on earth peace good will towards men
glad tydings of great joy which shall be unto all people to you is born a saviour which is christ the lord the one mediator between god and men iesus who gave himself a ransome for all who died for all by the grace of god tasted death for every man

god in him the wisdome of god that cryes out how long ye scorners will ye delight in scorning simple ones love simplicity fools hate knowledge turn at my reproof will pour out my spirit upon you make known my words unto you wherefore is a prize put into the hand of a fool seeing he hath not a heart to make use of it because call and ye refuse stretch out my hands to a rebellious and people and no man regardeth but ye set at naught all my counsel will none of my reproof also will laugh at your and mock when your fear cometh when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction as a when distresse and anguish cometh upon you because ye hated knowledge and did not chuse the fear of the lord for the turning away only of the simple slayes him and this is the condemation nothing else irrecoverably that light is come into the world and men love darkness more than light which is come into them to save and lead them to because their deeds are evil but who so hearkneth to me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from the fear of evil

and a number more like to these of solemn compellations complaints counsels consolations compassions wishings and wouldings corrections condemnations intreaties threatnings perswasions poured out to all men the most even a thousand to one of which are personally peremptorily predestinated never to have none of all this good nor life nor salvation nor the least dram of any such grace power light as may be of any efficacy or have any sufficiency in it but a common grace only that hath nothing but insufficiency in it et aetendatur howsoever attended to to bring them to it
is all this talked out to men bolted out from it all before ever they were born by an absolute decree for the personal transgression of one individual man and to have their portion in manifold more wrath and condemnation for refusing to come to god when they were called but never capacitated by any measure of such light and grace by which only they can possibly do ought that is required is all this openly as from the true mercifull god meerly tendred in hypocrisie to millions of miserable sinners to whom it's never intended that they must and shall come within the bounds of so much as a possibility of it nor have so much as arbitrium libertatum a liberty lent them to take or refuse but he kept down under a certain necessity of perishing contracted to them as is supposed from one single sin of one whom they never chose to be their proxy and representative of their persons to god so as that they would live or die for ever as he should stand or fall from whose loi~nes it doted by our dreaming divines that there is drawn and derived such by them inevitable damnation upon all individuals that for want of a sufficient light and grace vouchsafed them to lead them out of it to escape it as the four men aforesaid intimate to us the most must necessarily unavoidably unalterably as by gods particular private decree without reference to their finall rejection of god first sin from the womb to the tomb that they may by filling up their measure become vessels of wrath fit for destruction and upon account of that personal decree still concerning them not so much as possibly escape the condemnation of hell

must the most on the account of no saviours dying for them but for a very few only never see the lords salvation and yet be alwayes called

upon to look to him for it and told that christ died for them and have the salvation tendred to them in the name of god and be injoyned to believe he died for them for whom on their principle of christs dying not for all but the elect only which with these men are but very few one of a thousand in the world its a thousand to one whether they be of that small number he died for yea or no and yet for not that viz each person that he died for when he died but for some all must be condemned even because they believed not on him for that's the cause of all iudgement and condemnation to the world that perishes for sin iohn

even because they believe not in me saith he who enlightens all that come into it must the glad tidings of great joy that a saviour is born be proclaimed as glad tidings to all people when he is intentionally sent to save but some few and all the rest must hear the sad of a certain ser condemnation then if he had never come into the world at all because they believe not in him still that he died for them for whom yet he died not if he died for none but such a few as these men call the elect

what a strange uncouth representation of god and christ in their great goodness multitudinous mercy inconceiveable large love rich grace good will tender bowels incomparable compassion to the whole world is this of these men what a most grievous kind of glad tidings of great joy concerning a saviour to all people is this that he died to save one of a thousand but a thousand to one are remedilesly and more inexcusably irrecoverably unavoidably incontroulably and intolerably destroyed by occasion of his dying for every man then if he had never died for any man at all tell me ye narrow mouth'd old bottles that vent out so much of the old wine of your own wisdome and sent so sparingly of the new a thousand of you were sentenced to die were it a way to shew the mercy of the king to be matchlesly more then his severity and would you count him gracious to you all and deem it glad ridings of great joy that is so truly to you all to have a pardon tendred to you all on terms by you to be performed but intended really but to one of you so that the benefit of it shall effectually extend to but one and that in such a way as shall occasion the more severe execution of all the rest when tis in the kings power if he be minded to shew the riches of his mercy to be beyond his severity to save
and execute but one as an example were the other a common salvation to them all but say the salvation of god is common to all and everyman what ever these men say and even intended as truly as it is tendred and proclaimed to all or god who cannot lye would never so proclaim it nor his spirit stile it a common salvation as he does iude

therefore much more common is that saving grace and light which brings it to all men and all to it who walk in the teachings and leadings of it or else it could no more be grace gospel good news glad tidings to all people as it is but sad tidings truly to the most whereupon it is said of it by such ministers as sought to magnifie it of old as much as our churlists modern ministry to minifie it to be saving grace to all men though all are not actually saved by it tit
the grace of god that bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared as it could not be said to do if christ

under no consideration had vouchsafed it to all but to some only as i.o and the salvation it brings in a true tender to all men were intended only to few as t.d diminatively declares of it

yea in a word as grace were no grace to that man to whom its given if it were not saving or sufficient he using it to save him
so saving grace is no saving grace and so no grace nor glad tydings of great ioy at all to all people as tis though it bring salvation where it is if it appear to be given and to appear only to a few besides your selves tell vs of a common grace which is vouchfased to all men
but friends a few words with you and to all you followers and fainers of this fantastical piece of meer falsity not to say foolery who in the night while men sleep dream out this dark and doctrine of divinity which with the abundance of absurdities and confusions that are concatenated to it make up such an incredible kind of creed such a braky messe of belief such a of lightlesse literature such a wilderness of wondrous wisdome as no wise men nor any but such drunkards of ephraim as lie like briars and thornes enfolded together in one false faith that at last they may be consumed as stubble fully can find any other then a winding way into nor when he is in any other way easily out of but that of the spirit of god which searcheth and traceth out all the twinings and turnings of the serpent upon his rock

are you not yet ashamed the night being so far spent as it is in england and the day so nigh at hand to them that watch for it to appear upon the stage ye may well say not without a blush as t.d does before the world with such a gospel of glad tidings to it and all mankind in it as this that god loves all mankind wills not unless they will the death of any of them nor of any sinners but had much rather they should turn from their wickedness and live and would have them all come to repentance and life and not any to perish but all to come to the acknowledgement of the truth that in it unless they hate and turn from it and then his justice and wrath hath place to shew it self to so many persons they might be saved and hath sent salvation among them in his son the light of the world and word of life not bolting or excluding any from it but such as put it away from them and thereby judge themselves unworthy of eternal life and bath so loved the world as to send his only son into it to such as were else lost and likely else to perish not to condemn them further but to save them even qua sic as lost so consequently all men quatenus ipsum ever including de omni from condemnation or that alias to that end intent or purpose that unlesse against his honest true sincere wishing and woulding otherwise they needs will they might not perish but have everlasting life and so loved men also as to send his messengers among them to make universal proclamations of his large love to all mankind and in his name to publish glad tidings of great ioy even to all people and the good will of god toward men an indefinit phrase in a necessary matter equivalent to an universal and to call to every one that will to take of the water of life freely without exception of any positively personally or nominatim who exclude not themselves by their own personal unbelief of his love to them and refusal to come and without accounting any unworthy of his supper but such as come not when call'd and put

not on the wedding garment which renders them as taking away all their sins guilt and filth beloved accepted pure and justified in his sight as well as fit and meet to come into his holy presence as by their own righteousnesse that they work and not christ in them they are not any more then by unclean things dung losse and filthy rags and send out hue and cry also to summon all in to himself and blown a trumpet too even to all people to come and welcome promising to the removing of all obstacles and and objects of discouragement and giving good ground of hope to every man that there is mercy with god for him whatever his sins have been if he come in time before the dore be shut and while god calls and woes and knocks at the dore of his own heart within by the motions of his spirit that he will receive all comers and though they have a whoring from him after many other lovers and few men will receive their wives again that so do yet returning he will receive them so that whoever comes to him he will in no wise cast out but as he hath sent his son a propitization for the sins of the whole world and provided plenteous redemption and purchased salvation by his blood sufficient for them all so that he is able to save to the uttermost and will too effectually all that come to god by him and that it is his will they should all come also and reveals and publishes it as his will too expostulating very angrily with all men too for despising the riches of his grace for not being led to repentance in the day of his and salvation by his goodness telling them he waits upon them that he might be gracious to them saying that thou wouldst hearken to me that thy peace might be as a river wilt thou not be made clean for thus cry out clergy to all people where they preach when shall it once be why will ye die people have no pleasure in it that ye should and if any do delight not in the death of him that doth but that he will and there is no remedy unless alter my unchangeable will as will not for mans wills sake fith have done so much for him already that he may be saved unless he chuse to perish which will of mine is that the soul that sins and turns not from his wickedness that he may live shall die for ever and the very wicked turning from his wickedness and doing right shall not die nor yet have his sins mentioned unlesse he turn back from his righteousnesse into sin again and then be must die and though forgave him before yet he taking his fellow servant by the throat after must lay him up for the whole debt wherefore why why will ye die turn turn your selves and live and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for have done my part a friends part towards you have wrought in you both to will and to do of my free grace of my good pleasure it wants but your put+ting that into act which of my free grace have put into your power and your willing and doing accordingly and your getting up and trading with your talent and turning to the light that have entrusted you with and reprove your evil deeds by will ye alwayes resist my holy spirit when it moves in your hearts and be and stubborn turn yon at my reproof though ye are fools scorners delighting in scorning and will pour out my spirit upon you and make known my words to you if not as call and ye refuse so the time will be ye shall cry and will not bear you because ye did not chuse the fear of the lord would none of my counsel set at naught all my reproof which otherwise you should have found to have been the way of life

am in christ reconciling the world to my self not imputing trespasses and have sent out a ministry to declare this my reconciliation to the world as concerning all that's past if they now do not and abide in enmity am friends unless they will needs fight on and fight it out with me to the last and then they will have the worst have made him sin that knew none that they might be righteousness who are yet in their sins have given him a ransome for all and he hath offered himself and died for all that were dead in their sins and tasted death for every man now then hear my embassadors that pray you without as in my sons stead who also himself by his spirit strives with you to the same end within that ye would be reconciled to god and having those promises and received so much grace as brings salvation with it to such as despise it not receive not this precious grace of god

in vain but your selves from all uncleanness of spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god have you with the cords of my love ye will perish if ye refuse to return

say are ye not ashamed to go out as from god in whose name yet am sure ye never went with the doctrines that here under follow to publish to all people as ambassadors from him his so large love and the great and wonderful things that he doth for the whole creation of mankind saying what can he do more for you people the he doth unless you will have him violate his own unchangeable will for your sakes and save sinners in sin which he hath decreed never to do as irrevocably as he hath never to refuse such as come to him when he calls and hath enabled them thereunto
and yet after all this good news glad tidings to the whole world offers of a gospel of salvation to all people as far as ye are able to proclaim them then to come in with such cold comfort again upon them as this and put such a bit into peoples iaws and bridle on their mouths nsing them to erre so as to go round and tell them that of a truth and for truth they must take it from them and believe it as an article of their faith as doctrine that they are heretical if they deny it viz that though ye thus largely tender and offer salvation from god to them all without exception on condition they come and so that if they come they shall be accepted and there's grace mercy a saviour and salvation for them in christ in whom they are all to believe even every mothers child of them for himself that its there for him that he died for him and is his saviour which is the only good news to individuals and to the universal world of mankind also for its no glad tidings to a thousand to one in the world to hear that christ will save some one of a thousand among them and damn all the rest or all the rest he is preached to doubly by his coming into it because they believe not in him who yet was never given for them and this on pain of double condemnation

and though ye reveal this to them as the will of god yet there's no such matter of vniversal love or salvation intended to them all as ye tender extend talk of proclaim and offer from god to them all but his will in secret is otherwise then ye say these proffers are to another purpose

then to this intent that they all or half of them either or any but a very few of them should have it even but to leave men the more in sorer condemnation though ye bid all come and welcome yet all can't come nay none without god who calls give his saving grace that's true enough and most can never come for want of that saving grace for want of a sufficient light to lead them which grace and light they want also upon no other account then because god never did nor never intends to vouchsafe it them and that he hath a reserve in his mind a certain secret will within himself not known to man which runs otherwise then his revealed wil does that ye declare even a secret purpos which yet as secret as tis ye it seems pretend to know it and must be babling about it to the shaming and contradicting your selves ith t'other even to give this salvation but to a certain small number in comparison of the rest whom from eternity he hath reprobated and purposed personally upon adams score shall go without it which sin of that single man shall so remain on the score with him for ever that upon the account thereof a thousand to one of mankind his posterity though yet he would in words shew himself more rich in mercy to them all then severe to take advantage against any as to have it told thus in universal terms that his son died for them all for every man the whole world should be left without any interest or share in it or potential title thereunto and howbeit he will have them all call'd to come and lay hold on it and promises made of life to them on condition they come and believe in his son and his love to them in him yet he so hates them personally before ever born or doing good or evil that they shall never from him be sufficiently impowered to come or believe as he could impower them if he so pleased nor be put into any capacity by him to the life though set before them as well as the death with a chuse life that ye may live but be left for want of a will set at any liberty to chuse the good under a necessity of having the evil and to chuse either that or none and yet if they do not chuse the good too that advantage shall be taken the more against them to double vengeance on their heads for that helpless unavoidable fault of refusing the good and a quarrel against them upon the account of the old intended praeterition and so double execution be done upon them now as rebellious against the gospel of gods grace whereby he would in words alias seemingly though secretly he never would nor intended it have saved them and for not believing in his son as theirs when yet he left them lockt up when he call'd on them to believe so fast that he knew they could not answer and would not so much as se them neither to see if they would accept his love believe repent and make use of the remedy yea or nay in whom also if they had all believed most of them had as the case stood been deceived and believed but a lye a matter that was no such matter viz
that christ died for every individual of them if they would believe it so his wrath shall abide on them the more heavily for ever even because they believed not the testimony god gave by his ministers openly of his son that he died for them whom yet he died not for but only for a few elect one and so whereas god sayes he that believes not the testimony that god gives of his son viz that he gives eternal life by him to every man

that believes in him makes god a lyar if every man should believe in him as they all are bid and take the testimony of the life by him to themselves to be true either some must believe a lye since he died not for every man but for some only as they say or else their testimony is a lye and they all lyars which is indeed the truth who testifie that god gave his son intentionally but for a very few when gods own testimony of him is that he gave him a ransome for all

and moreover if they walk not in the light they have to salvation they shall be condemned therefore upon the account of the highest crime of all which light that each individual hath notwithstanding never was salutare so much as sufficient to guide them to salvation but naturale a thing that was too weak to such a business and fines salutares quod mers tenebrae caeritas as i.o
are ye not ashamed thus to ingross the grace of god which is great to all among your selves and a few like your sinning selves who think that ye shall scape as gods choice elected ones upon your blind confidence of it the wrath of god though ye are found living and dying in the same evills and not purged from sin nor believing ye ever shall be while ye live here for the sake of which wrath must come for ever on all others as on children of no other disobedience then that ye live and look to die in some degree of your selves seemeth it a small thing to you ye wofnlly blind pitiful or rather pitiless shepherds of this english israel as ye call it to eat up the good pastures your selves and in your fancies feed your selves and a few choice ones more ye count upon that lie in wickedness as the rest of the world with all the fine things of the gospel freely fully fairly and unfainedly offered to all as well as you as things truly intended to your personally from everlasting but to the most only extended without any true intent that ever they shall have them so impropriating the benefit of salvation to your sinful selves as if ye were such whom god so indulges as to wink at your infirmities and justifie you in and under the guilt of them if ye should happen with david to fail and slip aside into adulteries and murders whilst other mens failings and infirmities of a less hideous nature must be the faults and hainous crimes which god will shew no saving mercy as not intending it to them what e're he talks to a thousand to one of those that commit them that unavoidably upon the account of a certain inherent necessity of sinning drawn out of adams loyns together with their very being as men from under which necessity god never intends to help them so far as to give them sufficient grace or light to guide and lead them out of it or into so much as a liberty of doing better and all this before they have ever actually in their own persons so much as forfeited their share in that special grace or favour of his that is in common offered to all men by any personal rebellion and disobedience and so interesting your disobedient selves still as gods darlings in all the riches of his grace but detruding a thousand to one for the elect are very few with you as little disobedient as your selves irresistably into the depth of condemnation preaching out that which is your as their poyson and so designed to be from eternity without reference to any default in their own persons but such as is derived on them only from adams action seemeth it nothing to you to eat up all the good pasture

among a few of you but ye must tread down as mud and dirt and soul the residue with your feet and make all other people but your pretended saints and elect ones to eat and drink that doctrine about gods grace and gospel which ye make no grace or glad tidings but gall and wormwood and sad tidings when ye have trodden and fowled in this filthy pudly wise with your feet ezek

by these and the like sowrestuff which is like colloquintida in pottage do you spoil all your dainties ye set before men in your pretended gospel ministry of gods large love rich grace and matchless mercy to mankind with your tenders of things to all men from god that yet ye say god intends not to all to whom you tender and he by you extends them make men tantalize and set them all a gaping and staring after that which yet you tell them all may not must not cannot have because god purposes to give them but to a few hereby ye make your selves and god too like your selves a lyar in one or other of his wills and a meer mocker of men out of your mouths hereby you make your selves from god ministers of impossibilities to men ye must go about be paid largely for your pains too to call all men to do that on peril of eternal ruine and condemnation which yet on pain of condemnation too you charge them to believe as truth the contrary to which is herefie the most of them neither can do nor ever could nor shall ever be any ability by god sufficient to it hereby do you not only coop up the infinite saving special grace of god into a corner as have shewed but make it utterly of none effect to a thousand to one of mankind nor through any default or defect in the particular persons that have no share in it but in a certain common grace that can do them no good as to salvation only helps on their condemnation and given to no other end but to leave men more lyable to wrath without excuse as ye say that on the account of adams sin only which particular act of his hath all men for ever under sin wrath guilt and incapacity to live without gods grace which he yet will not vouchsafe but to a few which upon a personal appointment thereto must necessarily be saved and cannot chuse while all the rest are as personally peremptorily decreed to dumpation alias never to be so helped but that they must lye under the guilt of adams old sin and add new ones to incur a thousandfold more wrath upon their heads and condemnation for not coming from under the old which they were left lockt up from coming out of and so hereby ye make god like some merciless mocking tyrant calls to another tyed to a post come hither with sooming pretences and promises of great matters which he swears also he restly would have him have if he will come and yet he will not loose him when tis in his power to loose him and yet at last too because he comes not at his pretending for no other thing then that or else he desired not his death but had rather he should have come enjoyed the good things he hold out to him comes in wrath on the said and knocks him on the head for his refusing before ever it was tryed by any liberty or ability given him whether he would come yea or nay

hereby ye make god a lyar again on that ye draw down damnation on ost of adam sons for their fathers fault while they yet are innocent in

their own persons for all personal transgression ye say is the punishment entail'd on it and consecutive of the original sin when yet god hath long since said the son shall not bear the fathers sin whiles not actually succeeding him in the same and that proverb be used no more in israel of the childs teeth edged by the fathers eating four grapes but that soul that sins only it shall die ier
ezek
and every soul for his own iniquity only and not anothers under the new covenant or gospel for that was of old and concerning temporal things signifying how the seed of the righteous that succeed one another in righteousness are all blessed and the whole seed of the wicked cursed that succeed one another not in a way of fleshly generation but spiritual sinful degeneration in wickedness and blood and so the blood of righteous abel and his seed to this day shall be required at the hands of cain and his seed that hath shed it in this very generation

ye use to say the qua condemn all but themselves who condemn only in order to mens being saved but how do ye draw down to condemnation irresistably before they are born all but your selves i.e a few elect and chosen ones and such saints as ye are your selves that never mean to leave sinning for how can you when ye believe ye cannot so long as ye live in this world hereby ye shew your selves the niggards and churls that would sain be called bountiful and liberal too and yet make empty the souls ye would seem to fill and cause the drink ye call the thirsty to to fail from their throats and so bring tantatalus his condemnation on them as said above before their time
hereby ye shew your selves to be the old bottles that have none of the new wine in them but are pouring out for money to men such soure vinegar and wine of sodom as ye have to fell to the setting of the teeth of god and good men on edge with your gospel which to the whole world to which gods grace and gospel is to be preached and to most of them ye preach your so call'd gospel to also hath a thousand fold more condemnation judgement and remediless wrath and misery in it then it hath of salvation grace good news glad tidings to all or tender mercy to every man in it to whom you tender it in which attribute of mercy yet ye say your selves god desires more to be known by to the whole world of mankind if man himself hinder not himself from the sight and fruition thereof then by all his attributes besides
when the qua as you call them truly in one sense though scoffingly in your own are those liberal ones that lay not the large love of god up into a little nook as ye do but lay it forth in truth at large as it is and while you churls are evil toward them for it working iniquity in your hearts and practising hypocrisie delight in and devise the liberal things by which liberal things they shall stand

say are ye not ashamed thus to confound and contradict your selves as ye do upon your principles and to bely god and mock men as from him and make as if he meant not as he said and make him who was not so bad to pharoah himself as to burden and heighten him to destruction till pharaoh had hardened himself for though god did harden him and said he would

yet it was on the account of his seeing how he would first rebell or swell in pride against him as he had done all his life before even worse then pharoah himself whom he destroyed for so doing that punisht men for not making brick without straw by how much pharoah shewed himself but like himself from the first but god as ye represent god as walking under a cloak among men makes men if your doctrine is to be believed believe he loves them and truly wishes well to them all and yet within himself though outwardly saying he would not they should perish conditionally they be willing to come to him for life wills absolutely unavoidably the remedilesse destruction of a thousand to one of them

are ye not ashamed to make god not only tyrannical but hypocritical and as dissembling as your selves and not meaning truly as he sayes but meaning a few only when he sayes all to say that by every man he means some few seeming saints only such as your selves and that his meaning cannot be as his words import and that christ may be mistaken if his words be taken in the ordinary literal sense of them as if there were no hold to what he sayes
and to say that gods love is large to all and yet that under no consideration he hath vouchsafed saving light saving grace to all but only such a common grace as shall inevitably serve to damn them more then if he had never given it and then if christ had never come into the world and the gospel had never been preached and salvation never tendred to them but in no wise be sufficient to help them

are ye not ashamed to force maintenance from men as ye do to maintain you in your mock ministry and for running on such a sleeveless errand as this is to most men from god to all men and to bear your charges to the overcharging of a sinking nation for your sakes in your message of contradictions lies and utter impossibilities for so it is on pain of condemnation to call all to come to christ for salvation and to believe it every man for himself that christ died for him is tendered truly sincerely from god to him and in particular each is to believe him as his lord and saviour or perish and thae he is now freely proffered and as truly and unfeignedly offered from god to him as he did once offer himself to god for him as his ransome as well as for any and that there is this good ground for each particular man to believe it for himself because all without exception of any sinner in the world that does not exclude himself by his not coming are freely without respect of persons invited to come and this ground also that as he is truly without held out to all and all bid to come so god is willing they should come and have the salvation and to that end hath sent his son not to condemn but save them and his son his ministers to intreat them to be willing as he is and reconciled to him as he is to them and they declare from him according to gods words in the scripture that he died for and every man is a propitiation for the sins of the whole world and died for the ungodly and came to save them and heal the sick and seek the lost and such like and therefore every man may conclude its for him one as well as another that can say he is a man lost sick sinful ungodly and of the world and that god hath also wrought in them of his good to will and to do and therefore now they must up and be doing and work out their salvation which if it be not wrought out god hath done his part

and the fault is only in their own particular persons and yet in adam too and god is no hard master but hath given to every one one talent at least which if he hides he will be cast into utter darkness and weep and gnash his teeth at the remembrance of it that once he might have been happy had he not been wanting to himself and been an unprofitable servant with what he had and had not in his own person still mark put the salvation from him and hated the light and instruction and that god requires of men but the improvement of his own and much more to this purpose which all is sound true plain wholesome and saving doctrine and then to come with a new tale whereby all the good grounds before laid for every man that is called thereto to come and believe upon are utterly razed and removed and to tell them that though all are call'd invited outwardly yet an hundred to one are by a decree in gods secret counsel so secluded by adams sin that they cannot come nor have any right to christ he did not so much as die for them but for some elect ones nor offer himself for the most but a few though god indeed sayes all every man sinners ungodly the lost the whole world and makes offers to all where his gospel is preached yet by all and such like universal terms we must understand god and christ meaning another matter far otherwise then they say for in innumerable places where god says omnis all its the elect only one of a thousand he means so i.o tis an usual thing for god and christ to speak words of a doubtful sense

if we object but its the most ordinary and literal sense of the words and the very letter of the words so imports

tush tush quoth t.d never talk of that man tell thee tis usual with christ to speak words of doubtful sense so that his meaning may be mistaken when his words are taken in the most ordinary and literal sense and so twould be here if by every man we should understand every individual man know and confess the words import so john
but the indefinite phrase so t.d calls it though every man is an universal hath a restrained sense as elsewhere in the scripture christ tasted death for every man when as he died but for a certain number and the meaning of those words cannot be as the letter of them import for then the scripture would contradict it self but it must be if not in the other way in which said it might me then in this way as say that every man is not every individual man so t.d
and besides as god intends not the salvation to all its offered to so all its offered to on pain of sorer condemnation if they believe it cannot believe it nor accept it and he offers it to all upon condition of acceptance indeed could you suppose that all would take him at his word and accept his offer they should have the benefit thereof but that must not be supposed on pain of being heretical in the faith for tis not orthodox that men can come to god when he calls them nor accept of what he proffers nor believe in him whom he bids them believe in that he died for them in particular whom if they should believe in that tis so then tis so in deed in truth that he died for them else not as if he died not for sinners qua sinners and lost but qua believers which is absurd for men must have this first as a ground to believe upon that he died for them because for all every one sinners ungodly lost rom
rom
while yet sinners otherwise they have no ground on which to believe nor can any man that does believe

with any faith save that which is but meer fancy believe that christ died for him in particular but as he died for all
for thus a man may safely conclude christ died for every man for sinners lost ungodly the whole world therefore for me but bid a man believe christ died for him in particular tell him he died not for all but for one of a thousand the elect only and tell him also as t.d does the maisters know not the elect and ye cannot assure him he is that one of a thousand one of those few elect ones nor he himself neither know or be assured of it till after he believes it and ye utterly take away the ground he is to believe upon for he will argue thus rationally against you or with you to the shewing of your exhorting him to believe to be a piece of frivolous foolery

arg
ye bid me believe christ died for me has salvation for me which god by you offers to me and you call me to come to him for it as that which without hypocrisie or feignedness god would have me to enjoy being not willing should perish but what ground would ye have me to come upon or of assurance shall be welcome or accepted in my acceptance or of believing assuredly that god is really willing should have it ans
its sufficient for all
arg
that's not the question doubt not but there's sufficiency enough in christ to save all to the utmost that come to god by him but what's that to me that's not a sufficient ground for me to believe upon many things are sufficient for many things to many more men then are ere the better for them as some greedy grandees have many thousand pounds a year which is sufficient for an honest men to live honestly upon but he that shall go upon that account to feed and live at one of their tables may for all that be likely thrust out as an intruder but can you tell me the glad tidings that that is for me if so i'le believe it and accept it and come with all my heart if you can lay a ground for me to be confident on that may if come not be more bold then welcome
ans
all are invited and call'd to come and call'd freely fully without exception to believe therefore why not thou arg
but friends though all be called to come and welcome to god by you who say ye are his ministers is this in sincerity and truth or in hypocrisie and ackage is god as willing as ye seem to make him that all shall come to life
arg
yea without hypocrisie for god cannot dissemble nor mean one thing and say another though we say so of him sometimes as t.d does he is freely willing if thou art willing he would not have thee die but much rather live

arg
but how shall know that yet for my self does he intend the salvation to all as really as ye pretend he does in the universal extent and proffer or to only for some of you say he does offer it where he intends they to whom ye say so sincerely offered shall never have it but are by a secret decree of god bolted out from it for adams sin before they were born in the guilt of which though he will save a few that he may shew his mercy live grace to all as some sillily say to be of more extent then all his works which few are only known to himself and not as ye say to you and me he will praeterire pass by even a thousand to one to perish unavoidably notwithstanding christs death and so may be one of those many for ought either you or know yea a thousand to one but that am to perish and therefore still have far more

reason to believe according to those principles that am one of those thousands to one that must perish and to whom christ is not intended by god for all your fair proffers of him from god to me then that one of a thousand elected to life by him there's no small odds in these two for if but an hundred men were sentenced to be hanged and a pardon should be proclaimed to them all and yet such an come that its not intended to the whole hundred but to one of them only and ninety nine must be hanged for all this and he that is so free in proclaiming the pardon can't tell me neither that am the only man that must be spared should think him a fool if he should stand pressing me to believe it that am he and can shew me no evidence of it and shall still rather believe do what can that am of the ninety nine and should think him little less then mad too if he should tell me that if do not believe it that ithe man when yet he bids all the rest believe it too each for himself upon that same penalty in case they do not shall be hanged for this very thing as he sayes every of them shall too as the chief account on which they perish even because we do not believe every man for himself that he is the man and for despising the mercy tender'd and the large love of the and such like and that in a more severe way of execution even with quartering whereas nor nor any of us all should perish if we did believe it now does he intend it to all of them if so there may safely believe he does to me else cannot

ans
not so in any wise
arg
does he intend it to the most ans
nay but to very few

do ye know am one of those few that he intended it to or of those many to whom not ans
no not we are servants we know not what the master does not which are the elect which not
arg
on what ground then bid you me believe am one of the few its more likely am of the many that must perish even by how much they are so many to one more then those are that must live ans
all that come shall have it
arg
how can that be when yet ye say its not intended to all which if it be true suppose all should accept it and come as ye say all cannot neither for want of power they cannot have it because not intended for them ans
yea its offered on condition of acceptance faith and coming so that could ye suppose all would take god at his word and accept the proffer they should have the benefit
arg
but that must not be supposed nor cannot rationally according to your principles who tell us all cannot come cannot believe nor accept for to accept believe the power at least must come from god and he hath not say you given that nor saving light under any consideration to all but to those few only to whom he intends the salvation which still demand a ground from you whereupon to believe am one of which till then cannot believe any more then groundlesly and groundless faith is no better then vain hope which is fancy that will fail when men come to give up the ghost ans
believe only in the lord jesus and thou shalt be saved believe and the salvation is thine

arg
but that's idem per idem still the thing ye are to give me a ground to

do but cannot should believe it if ye can shew me a ground whereupon you would have me first to believe it and then my believing it will be a sufficient ground for me whereupon to believe it whereas must first have some ground wherein that faith ye call me to must stand and whereon it must be founded for faith is not the ground of it self and your crede quod habes habes as foolish a conceit as if ye should tell me that a man never saw intends to give me an inheritance in particular when yet ye never heard him say so and would have me believe it yet can give me no good ground whereon to believe it but your single say so who yet say ye know not that am the man he intends it to neither only ye have heard say he proffers it to a thousand not me by name and yet for all it is proffered to so many its intended only to one of them

ans
if thou wilt believe it is so
arg
but is it so that he intends it to me really and particularly ans
nay cannot tell that its hid from me but this is all we can say that he intends it to some really and he offers it to all conditionally they believe so that if thou believe it its thine

arg
cannot believe that though you bid me nor ought neither which you who bid me believe it can give me no ground for nor evidence of that it is so and confess your selves you know not whether it is so or no that he died believe as ye say for some and so they believe all o're christendome and in england and also believe mostly every man for himself that christ died for him where yet for all your saying he that believes so hath him there's not one of many him as your selves confess whose faith therefore which ye beget many to is mostly fancy for they have not the salvation yet which is from the sin but to believe it without more evidence for it that it is a truth he died for me even for me in particular then see upon what principles ye are able to give me were as fond as to believe a piece of news for truth which the man who tells it tells me he knows it not whether it be a truth or no but much doubts it or glad tidings of great joy to all people which the himself can give me no evidence at all that it belongs to me at but after his most universal publication of it that he has tidings to all and every one and would have every one believe it so to himself begins to fall back into such a diminutive prate or pinching privication or private publication as when demanded about his news in this manner friend thou sure this thou extendest to all is good news intended to all is it so to me in particular whom thou bidst believe it good news to me replyes in this wise nay cannot say that say its to all and every one but by those terms mean but some and those very few and cannot say which nor whether in particular thou art one of them or nay yet thou must believe it or else sad tidings will come after it thou shalt be hanged up for not believing its glad tidings which said news monger should judge so little worth much heeding crediting or believing in what he sayes that should rather think him out of his wits and to have suffered some shipwrack as our priests have done of the true faith of his very common sense and reason shew me therefore what evidence ye have of the truth of the thing ye tell me and bid me believe or else its but as implicit faith as at rome if should believe it and not because see it likely but because ye say so who yet tel me of what ye say or bid me believe viz that christ died for me for he died for some the elect only that he cannot tell at all

whether am one of those elect ones for whom yea or may

answ
we say still it is offered to you as tis to all on condition of acceptance and of faith so that who believes it shall have it whoever he is and tis believing evidences it to be so
arg
still ye run but in a round as the colliers faith does and say no more in effect then thus first believe and be confident that christ died for thee and then this faith and belief of it that he died for thee is a sure good ground or evidence for thee upon which thou mayest believe and be confident that he did die for thee and that thou art one of those few he died for and not of those many to one to all whom as freely as to thee he is offered not one of whom yet he died for or was by god ever intended to
answ
but mind the condition though he is offered to all on condition of acceptance so that if thou perform the condition as most do not for few will come thou must have the thing promised thereon that is the salvation
arg
the condition know christ is not only offered to all on condition but intended also to be the saviour of all on that condition they reject him not but believe in his name come at his call and obey his voice and counsel which god also by his truth grace and love puts men into capacity to do or not to do at their choice
but as for your condition say it's more monstrous then all the rest while for all your offers to all conditionally they believe ye say it's peremptorily intended but to few and those few shall not chuse but perform it and an hundred to one are as peremptorily intended by god to be never interested in it nor enabled to perform the condition ou which only its meant

ye say indeed god offers and tenders salvation by christ to all conditionally they believe in him each man that he died for him but what is this so long as it's not intended to all and there is no such matter as ye say to believed unlesse most men believe a lye as that christ died for all and every man for a man to tell an hundred condemned men there is life offered to them all on condition they every man of them believe it is so as he sayes and to bid them believe it as the truth for want of believing of which only they shall be executed more cruelly in believing of which they shall be saved and then to tell them the said pardon is really positively and peremptorily intended but to one of them only and not one of all the rest assuredly shall ever have it its absolutely unalterably decreed that the ninety and nine shall be hanged is to destroy all the ground of the belief ye would beget them to and to carry an hundred men up on high into a steeple in vain aiery hopes of some glorious sight pretended to be shewed to them all that from thence advantage may be taken as the thing intended for all the fair pretence to throw ninety and nine of them down go the breaking of their necks and the mischieving of them more then if they had never been so fairly premised and so highly elevated and but one of them be shewed the light which to all was promised for the absolute decree and intent of god must ever inavoidably stand and take place against the conditional proffer of that which in the decree is not intended so the proffer on condition still is not worth a straw nor any thing but a meer mockage of men and such a one as is before that time wherein god sayes he will mock and laugh at men which is only when they have finally rejected what once they truly might have had and was indeed as truly intended

as tendered on condition they by their wills refuse it not prov
psal
for what god absolutely wills and intends ever is does come to passe but what he intends much more what he does but offer us and tender and not intend at all but conditionally of mens standing or falling rejecting or receiving when he has put them into an equilibrio for either may be one way or another this or that so or so and yet gods absolute decree stand inviolable unalterable alibi as namely adam when he was stated fm god upright as a stick may be set upright by a man resolving which way it falls it shall lie either in mire or on fair ground had posse peccare posse non god left him to his choice intending as to the man conditionally that if he fin'd he should die if not live and should have love or hatred from him according as he did but as to the two states of sinning or standing is decree was absolutely unalterably thus viz tthat the life should be the reward of the standing and the curse the reward of the sinning happiness and blessing he felt in the one way oe and wrath and misery in the other so is the election and reprobation of god not absolute but conditional only as to persons but absolutely without condition and inalterable as unto stares things wayes actions good or bad wickedness or righteousnesse so that in the way of righteousness he hath absolutely intended life shall be enjoyed and in the path way thereof no death to any as found therein and as absolutely that the way of the wicked or of wickedness and ungodliness shall perish and they in it that forsake it not that the seed of the serpent shall be bruised satan and all that serves him as so and the seed of the woman only blessed

but now as to persons his decree and intent is truly his proffer i.e universally and conditionally to all that as they do they shall hav as they sow reap corruption or life the seed is they serve and are one with their portion shall be as the way is they chuse finally to walk in of good and evil truth or deceit light or darkness life or death which are both set before them so their end shall be without change because though he would have all persons chuse life that they may live yet so as leaving them to their choice yet to this way he hath everlastingly intailed the blessing to that the curse without alteration for ever ut alibi wayes are absolutely approved or reprobated men only conditionally as chusing the wayes either approved or reproved so that while ye say god proffers conditionally only to all but intends absolutely that one of a thousand shall not have the benefit of the salvation besides the mockage that is in that offer he cuts the throat of all that comfort that is or can be conceived by it and is also a flat contradiction to say god offers salvation to all which is as much as to say pretends himself willing that all truly should have it and yet to say also as t.d does that god does not pretend to intend the benefit offered to all to whom it is offered for however ye say falssy that he in himself really intends it not to all yet this is true that so long as he proffers it to all he pretends thereby to intend it to all to whom it is offered or else ye run on a much more sleeveless errand then before viz pretending that to men which yet ye say your selves for all your offering it in his name and pretending to offer it as from god god neither intends nor yet so much as pretends they all shall have it to whom ye offer it which err and god never sent you on but ye run on your own heads with your heels upwards to the work of preaching the gospel and so no marvell that ye turn it upsidedown

that god intends not salvation to all to whom it is offered and yet though he offers it saying look to me and he saved my hand is not shortened that is cannot save nor my eare heavy that it cannot hear if your sins separate not good from you as live would not have any of you perish would have all saved and know the truth and come to repentance and life have sent my son that alias to that intent ye should not be condemned but saved and yet thereby to say he pretends not to intend it as if all his fair proffers are not only without any intent to save or do as he sayes he is willing to do if we be not wanting but as willing but also not so much as tantamount to apnetence of such a thing is such a mess of propositions as by which the propounder thereof little lesse then pretends to intend to proclaim himself before the whole world yet this is t.d prittle in his parcell am yet in hand with whose deep divinity in it shall take notice of yet a little more as follows


do not affirm god offers it to all men for many ages and generations never had one proffer tim

last
rep
the mere shame for thee that thou deniest it to the damning of all men in all ages before the time of christs appearance in that flesh that died at ierusalem as thy quoting that intimates was the gospel of salvation because more clearly offered as to the promulgation then not at all offered before was it because now more revealed then so hidden as not at all revealed to any ages above what abominable grossnesse is here had not all the iews and some gentiles as ninivee by ionah the gospel preached to them as well as to us though to us more plainly but that they believed it not that very text also sayes god was manifest in the flesh was justified in the spirit seen of angels preached in the gentiles en ethnesin believe on in the world received up into glory was the preaching of the gospel en pase te en ethnesin in the gentiles in every creature though a mystery confess and so to you at this day never manifested in any man or in any measure at all before
but do affirm its offered to more then intended
rep then as said the proffer is to little purpose
yea tis to some purpose too as the light is given i.e to leave men without excuse
rep a cold piece of comfortless glad tidings a a to the world that is given not to save but to this purpose and intent further to condemn most of them to leave them without excuse as thou sayest and thy three fellows also yet shall shew by and by does not as ye hold it leave them without excuse neither a truth that if it were so as thou sayest it only were a belying of god as r.h truly told thee

no for he pretends not to intend it to all to whom its offered the election obtains it the rest are blinded and beside he offers it on condition of acceptance to all and could ye suppose all would take him at his word and accept his offer they should have the benefit

rep
but that must not be supposed from the principles of thy personal election of a few and blinding all the rest from the very birth nay

cannot be supposed thou shouldst say could suppose they could take god at his word and accept for by thy principles and os of denying the saving ability so to do the most they to whom it's not intended can no more accept or believe then tis possible if they should believe they should obtain that which they are personally and absolutely reprobated from so long before for if god do not will not give hath not given as ye say he hath not some measure of the saving grace whereby to believe and accept it to all whom he offers life to on that condition of acceptance but calls and requires them to believe and accept what he knows they cannot without him this makes him as much a mocker of men still as such a merciless tyrant and arrand hypocrite as shall stand aloof off from one hungry that is lockt in the stocks with a dish of meat in his left hand and a in his right saying why wilt thou starve thou man come to me and here is meat for thee am freely willing thou shouldest have it and not perish never coming neer to unlock him all this while nor bringing the meat within his reach but if thou wilt not come will knock thy brains out and so because he comes not when yet he knows he cannot runs on him pretending to do just vengeance on him for his wilfull refusing his own help when he might alias never might have had it and cuts him to pieces indeed for he that on pain of punishment death and condemnation if the terms be not performed tenders life and salvation on termes and conditions utterly impossible to be or ever to have been performed by the person to whom the tender is unless a grace be given him which yet never shall be is an hypocrite and a tyrant and such a one ye make god by your doctrine who yet is no such but that ye belie him as such as he that shall say he truly desires to make me his heire and so tenders me a good estate conditionally will take a journey to the man in the moon first to get it confirmed there when come back again but if refuse to go thither he will kill me and so because cannot climbe up to the moon falls on me and puts me to death indeed

arg
moreover gods offer of salvation to many to whom he intends it not on conditions he knows they cannot perform without him and yet not so much as enabling them all to perform them when he might but some few only to whom he intends it makes god a respecter of persons as truly said of it when yet god is no respecter of persons as the scripture saith but in every nation men that fear him and work righteousness are accepted with him and not otherwise

to that of making god a respecter of persons this answer will suffice did god give salvation to some who accept not of it out of particular fancy to them but exact of that acceptance and for default thereof deny them salvation then there might be some ground for the cavil but now that its offered upon equal termes there is none

rep does not god upon your blind principles of personal election or loving of a few out of a particular fancy to them and peremptory reprobation and hating the most of mankind before they were born without respect to foreseen good or evil to be done in time in their own persons excepting the respect to adams sin which the sublapsarians

prate of against the supralapsarians whose blind wranglings whether election be ex massa corrupta or pura are not more wearisome toilsom then they are both and loathsome to look upon by any that love and know the truth give salvation to some out of fancy who accept it no more then others but as he as you say makes them to do it by an irrestible power which he denies to the other and exact of the other that obedience he enables them not to and that for default thereof not only deny them the salvation but also damn them down into double condemnation does not god do so say according to your principles and if so then is there not a ground by thy own confession for that assertion thou call'st a cavill i.e that god by your doctrine is doctrinally made a respecter of persons and whereas thou sayest salvation is offered to men on equall termes and therefore there is no ground to assert god a respecter of persons say tis the truth we hold indeed that tis on equal termes tendered to men so far at least that till some put the word of life from them and the salvation that is sent to them so making themselves unworthy of it when others receive it it is so brought by christ the light that the whole world might be saved as well as some of it iohn
iohn
and where it is offered there are none to whom it is not as sincerely intended on condition of acceptance as it is to some and so god is in truth no respecter of persons
but darest thou say and is it not a contradiction to thy self for thee t.d as thy principles are to say salvation is offered on equal termes who saidst above that among those where the gospel is preached salvation is offered to more then to whom it is intended if it be truly intended to any one and not truly intended to every one to whom it is offered but it is for all the fair offers absolutely decreed a few shall have it and shall not chuse but perform the condition of it which is acceptance and as absolutely decreed that the most shall never be enabled to perform the said condition of acceptance which is exacted of them and so shall unavoidably go without it are these equal termes is not this offer upon as unequal termes as if a man should tender to two condemned prisoners bound up in chains that they shall both live if they will come out of prison but if not they shall be more cruelly executed for refusal intending to unlock one of them that he may come forth and to light lead and compel him irresistably to come forth also that he may have the benefit of the pardon and live and as absolutely intending to leave the other lock'd under restraint in his chains utterly devoid of any liberty to come forth to the end that he may cut him off from any benefit of the promised pardon and take double vengeance on him for thereof and are these equal termes are these wayes so equal as god sayes his wayes are ezek
who absolutely wills not the death of any that are as willing to live as he would have them and that do not wilfully die for want of turning from those iniquities in which they cannot live and from which he impowers them to turn but that they refuse it as well as leaves them to chuse death too if they will neees have it who sees not the foolish frivolousness and of t.ds
divinations


and for christs being given for salvation to the ends of the earth that imports not so much as that the offer much less the benefit should be of such extent

in all ages and generations as the fulfilling of that prophesie bears date from the apostolical commission
and it intends that no nation how remote soever from judea should want the offer nor some of it the benefit of salvation

rep see how unsound iudgements jump together christs coming a true light into the world to enlighten every man in it i.o as is seen above dates but from about the time of his appearing in that person that years since died at ierusalem and his being a light to the nations and gods salvation to the ends of the earth is dated from much what about the same period according to t.d his calender but as for the extent of his light and salvation which is said to be to every man that cometh into the world and to the very ends of the earth this is extenuated by them both into an extreme little compass in respect not only of time and seasons but of places and persons also· for first as here is a cutting off of all ages and generations before the apostolical times by both and from any benefit from christ and his light and from any interest in his salvation and of all nations for years together as it were by the lump and sale happily they except the little nook of the iewish nation which saving a few that walk't with god in the light of christ as some in other nations did was in moralities well nigh as wicked generally as any people yea to the justifying of her sister sodom it self
and secondly even of these last ages since the said appearance of christ in flesh the major part by thousands to one are in the doctrine of our divines cut off not by their own obstinacy and rebellion against christs light for so we say most are without the benefit justly enough for hating and not coming to christs light in their hearts which else would save them but by god himself for want of his them such a light as if improved is sufficient to salvation for if all nations have the offer of it now as in an outward ministry they have not had since christ nor yet have there being not a few at this day to whom the outward news of salvation is not come by any outward ministry and therein t.d is also out in his accounts yet where the offer is there's not one of many according to these two men that have so much grace ever given them of god whereby to be in capacity to lay hold on it because its intended but to few even of such and so the offer is but a meer mockage still all have not the offer and of such as have that but few the benefit of the salvation because not intended though rendered to them and they not put in possibility for it for want of saving light or sufficient to accept it or to perform the condition on which its rendered and so as universally as is talkt of in scripture in terminis as belonging to all yet by the restrained senses they put on these universal terms as some a few the elect its not one of a that can have the thing or are intended by god to have any share in it
but ye niggards and churls that are called by the name of masters in is the spirit and saving light and saving grace saving health and salvation of the lord thus straitned and limitted as ye limit them are these his doings doth he mean as ye say he does when he sayes all every man the whole world and not rather as he sayes himself are not your doings thus to pervert the right words and wayes of

the lord and with your narrow senses to distinguish the most infinitely immense mercy and incomprehensibly large love of god to all mankind and every individual person thereof that does not first personally slight and sin against it and so pull more misery upon themselves into such a diminutive matter as amounts truly seriously and intentionally to the redeeming of some one of a thou and from misery to no more then a meer making of a thousand to one more miserable then if he had never sent the news of that mercy in christ and a most cruel mocking of those individual persons in that as to them from the first remedilesly derived and decreed misery also is this the glad dings of joy to all people and all mankind that by their own neglect do not loose their share in it to tell them by general proclamation that there's salvation and life for them all in christ without exception and its offered on equal terms to them all without respect of persons and then to tell them after that this salvation which is so infinitely sufficient for all is intended but to few among them and those are ye know not which and these few shall assuredly partake of it and many to one shall as assuredly never see it nor be made capable to come to it by any light sufficient to lead to it though never so well attended to because it was never intended to them but from all eternity the very contrary was intended and irrevocably decreed as their particular individual persons that they shall perish for and not be one jot the better for that salvation do what they can by the improvement of that light and grace they have from god which is only common and not saving nor able to help them and god in no wise will help them to more but leave them helpless that the salvation may by them to the few to whom its intended and be as to the rest only as a means to make them liable to more wrath for their refusing it and more without excuse in the midst of that misery too that's encreased by it is this your of gods infinite grace to all men in christ that very few shall be saved but unavoidably by any thing that god will ever enable them to do to the contrary most men perhaps a thousand to one of those to whom its offered shall be according to gods unchangeable and personal decree concerning them in that kind doubly damned by christs coming into the world of whom ye shameless ones do you not hear god say he sent him not to condemn but to save the world which yet through the despising his true grace and hating his saving light when its come to them are his love notwithstanding the more sorely condemned is this good news to an hundred to hear that one of them shall be highly preferred and none shall hinder it but as uncontroulably his rise shall be the ruine of all the rest and and an occasion whereupon the ninety nine shall come all to be hanged ye fools and blind is this your liberal universal rich gospel to the whole world ye graceless gospel ministry of england and vniversities of the same about which there is such ado among the powers parliaments armies and their generals courts committees cities and their common councels of late that ye may be so richly liberally and universally maintained in your private promulgations of it not far from your own fire sides much less so far as christ gave commissian to his ministers to publish his gospel going out into all the world all nations every creature the ends

of the earth but like gospel like minister of it a private particular publication of it for pay and by each preacher in his private particular parish or place of preferment is most proper to such an impropriated private particular gospel as yours is whose care is more according to the provision the earthly powers that are bewitcht by you make for you in that particular to make augmention of your own means in the earth then an augmentation of gods true gospel so far as to all ends of the earth by exposing of your own persons to the pains and weariness and travels and hazards that many of christs servants have gone through and some even in these dayes for the sake thereof or for the sake of your non gospel either which yet sith tis your own and another then that which paul and others then preached its no great matter for a private preaching of it is fittest for it whether it go so far yea or nay as to the ends of the earth and indeed much farther then it has gone it must not go neither in respect of time nor place and no great for pauls anathema is entail'd to it and the folly of is beginning to be made manifest unto all men as theirs also was
even iannes and iambres who of old withstood moses and the truth if any man judge me too long in this business let him excuse me if he please or if not let him chuse matter it not for here honestly profess the doctrines that are entail'd on each other· in this matter of particular election of a few and personal reprobation of most men by god from both salvation and all possible sufficient means of it either upon or before adams fall without reference to personal good or evil first performed or committed do hang so together like some tangling bushy brake of and thorns to the cumbring of the ground where the truth it self should grow out and are such a wild wilderness of contradiction and confusion that being by the way whereinto and dark distinctions have driven me once entred into it· cannot easily on a sudden find any way out of it again and must walk yet a little further before can be so clearly quit of as desire to be

sayes that its so certain from innumerable places of scripture that christ hath not savingly enlightned all but some only that he hath no spiritual understanding who once dreams to the contrary whereas say he hath yet no more then a meer mysty into the mystery of gods love in christ to the world who limits it only to a few know the scripture from one end to another yet know not so much as one place wherein there's the least hint against the universality of his sufficient all twould have been more to my satisfaction had named but one testimony of scripture and directed us to it then to give us intimations of innumerable texts and testimonies to that purpose· and set down not so much as one which till he doth shall be so bold as to tell him there is not one at all of any true tendency that way but very many more besides those to which evince the universality of christs death the commonness of his salvation the generality of sufficient light grace and of the gift of his righteousness unto all and upon as they believe without difference or respect of persons rom

the usual common silly shifts and pedling put offs that are made against

those texts which speak in universal terms are that by all all men every man every creature the world all the world the whole world not all and every one indeed is meant but some the elect only which calls few in comparison of the rest all manner of people not jews only but gentiles also
so tom and baxt
the senses in which christ mediator enlightens with spiritual light every man that cometh into the world john
that text may be understood of this light two ways
all who are enlightened with spiritual light
all sorts and nations of men gentiles as well as jews not singuli generum but genera singulorum some in all nations some iews some gentiles and among the gentiles some barbarians some scythians some englishmen some french some turks some tartars not all in every nation not all of every sort but some of all sorts some kings and men in authority some under authority some rich some poor some masters some servants not the whole globe or wheel of the world but i.os whimsie or wheel within a wheel that is his church or as others mundus electorum ex mundo electus this and such like is the narrow strict restrictive rattle of i.o.t.d.i.t.r.b and the rest of that fry whose restrained senses of so universal terms let us reason together about a little

rep
is it so indeed friends that these so eminently comprehensive terms all everyone signifie no more then some a few as aforesaid is this syncategorema istud omnis the of that adiective all is it so as i.o sayes per omnem hominem non omnes singulos sed quosvis tantum intelligi debere that by all and every one we ought to understand not all and every man but some only all not absolutely but respectively to the elect which are but few this is more then ever could yet understand since left off to be as ye are and will be more ere long if ye go on to fight against the light without understanding to this very day
to say that all may signifie many as many is sometimes expressive and truly conclusive of all and not exclusive of any as rom
is much better to be born with but that all or at least that every man which is more indigitative of every individual without exception should be said to signifie not so much as the major but the minor part of men this is one absurdity more then ever learnt before from any but the unlearned labours of your selves and such as side with you in your senses upon the scripture


if it be no absurdity but usual and proper to intend not all men nor ill men which are the most but the elect a few good men only by those terms all men every man all the world and not every individual prout innumer is aliis locis as it is used quoth i.o in innumerable other places then shall the more willingly excuse him who shall interpret those texts viz rom
rom
gal

and many more texts which must be some of i.os numberless number there being not innumerable places besides them that speak of all mens being gone out of the way
all mens having sinned and falling short of gods glory dying in adam
all the worlds becoming guilty before god
all believers being justified all saints honoured
also

such places as speak of gods being avenged on all that obey not the gospel thes
and such like respectively not of all and every man every believer every saint every rebel against the gospel but of some few a few believers a few saints a few rebels against the gospel which were an absurdity unsufferable if not no less then madness in the abstract
but i.o that he might at least insanire cum ratione in proof that there are innumerable places besides iohn
where these general terms are so restrained makes a shift to produce one which is as much to his purpose as one can be that it that is col
where paul sayes the gospel is come into all the world by which term all the world i.o understands not all men but the elect only heeding as little as he does other matters that the same apostle in the same chapter ver
speaks of the same gospel in the same way as here that it is preached en pase te in every creature that is under heaven

so that the ver which is i.os instance doth by all the world intend the same subject as he does by the term every creature which is not such a pia as the elect only for then the absurdity would be no less in these two verses then it would be so to interpret it in mark
where both these terms stand together and how gross would it be when christ sayes to his messengers collectively considered go out into all the world and preach the gospel to or in for there's no preposition every creature he that believes shall be saved to read and render these general terms not absolute as i.o sayes omnis must not be but relate ad electos with reference only to the elect a fool may see for as shewed above from iohn
of the word world so may much more here shew from the word all the world the folly of them that will have it signifie no more then the elect it being then to be thus read viz
go out unto the elect and preach the gospel to every elect one whoever in all the world that is among the elect believeth and is baptized shall be saved but whoever among those elect ones believeth not shall be damned here's i.os syncategoremaistud omnis yet surely as far as both he and t.d are from holding the gospel to be intended by god to any but those few they call the elect neither of them is such a niggardly churl but they are both rather so free as to have the gospel excepting ever what large pay the preachers must have for it very freely offered from god to no less then all whether this be any of those innumerable places i.o means when he sayes the word omnis all is so used in them or not know not but here's the same terms every creature and all the world as are used in that col
which he alludes to and if this be not one doubt his number will come short of numberless for at present as shall look no further so mind no more then one place where the same term of all the world is used viz rom
where its said all the world is become guilty before god which if i.o read non absolute but relate ad qu svis tantum that is ad electos excluding all the rest as he does the worst from the grace of god so as to say a few of the world only that is the elect are become guilty before god then let's eat and drink that we may live and dye reprobated from god and so become guiltless none but his elect become guilty before him who are of all men then indeed most

and as i.o so t.d seems not to dote without at least some seeming shew of a reason for his most impossibly proper sense of that term every man that cometh into the world john
by which truly told him he makes john a ly and so say too while he understands it of but some of every nation and those so few that page pamp he stiles them a small number in comparison of the rest who are not enlightned t.d
no such matter quoth he make not the apostle a lyar for the indefinite phrase hath a restrained sense as elsewhere heb
christ tasted death for every man when as he died but for a certain number

rep
to which need say no more among wise men then to tell t.d that if he himself unawares in saying every man is an indefinite phrase let him only fetch back that bolt of his which was so soon shot and shall freely give it him again and there's no harm done but if he shot it not in hast but wittingly twas with so little due deliberation that as brief as he is page
pamp to take on him to teach g.w who in things of god may be his teacher he had need to be taught again notwithstanding the flourishing his title page with m.a by such as hold it fitter to forget then to teach others any of that tyruncular kind of learning that man and men are indefinite phrases in such necessary matters are equivalent to an universal though in some contingent business they are aedaquate only to a particular but as for omnes homines omnem hominem quoseun{que unumquem{que all men every man and such like these are so far from being but indefinite as hominem quosvis homines that they are the most express universal terms that can be spoken yea nothing is more universal according to the very litteral sense of the words then vper panton anthropon panta anthropon ercomenon eis for all men every man that cometh into the world these specially this last every man is so indigitative and absolutely conclusive of each individual that it is not at all exclusive or exceptive of any at all and if every man the be an indefinite phrase as t.d ayes know none is universal for all is not if it be so much more comprehensive then that of all without exception and if as he sayes every man that cometh into the world be but some a few of every nation kindred tongue and people then i'le read and render by the same rule the word every as affixed to nation tongue so restrictively too for who shall forbid me t.d of all men can't thus viz
every man of every nation that is only some a few men of a few nations a few families tongues and people and then i'le carry the grace of god and incomprehensible light of christ into a small compass and diminutive corner of the world indeed

but t.d perhaps deems se imperatorem esse and so may leges dare non accipere for when we use any term in a sense that troubles him then the phrase imports otherwise quoth he the words intend so or so it must bind and be cogent to us saying when he sayes rex sum sic volo sic iubeo nil ultra quaero plebeius but when we tell him as we do in this the words import otherwise the very literal sense of them cannot be that then he tramples that down tush quoth he the meaning of those word cannot be as the letter of them does import for then the scripture must contradict it self it was an usual thing with christ to speak words of a doubtful sense

his meaning may be mistaken when his words are taken in the most ordinary and literal sense and so it would be if by every man we should understand every individual man

rep where note first that t.d yields that the most ordinary and literal sense of every man is every individual man and that the letter of those words every man iohn
does indeed import no other then we say against t.d and i.o viz
that the true light which is that of christ enlighteneth every individual man that comes into the world
and so secondly to the contradiction of himself who so calls it that every man is not an indefinite but an universal phrase and so cannot have such a restrained sense as in some cases not all an indefinite expression may for mostly an indefinite it self is equivalent to an universal and if it be taken according to the proper import ordinary and literal sense of it it is to be read every individual man

that in those three places iohn
heb
cor
christ enlightneth tasted death for every man died for all the letter and the true proper genuine ordinary and litteral sense which the words all and every man import is on the qua side by t.ds own free or rather forced confession and whether they who fighting and scoffing at the light and spirit within which only reveals it know it not or will grant that or no we know that we have the true meaning and mind of christ

what hath t.d and i.o left then on their sides to help themselves with nempe velle suum cuique est nec voto vivitur uno every man his own will even what opinion he pleases quot homines bis tot as many more minds as men for they do not both in every thing fain the same nor doth each of them fancy the thing at all times alike but is at odds about it within himself i.o hath two shifts as have shewed but never a good one to slide away by but one of which t.d shuts in with t.d hath three two of which as short as they are of truth in his own intent extend far enough as is said above to give the cause contended for to us and the third which is os also hath nothing to say for it self but that it's a wresting and restraining the phrases all and every man besides their ordinary literal signification and import it cannot be as the words and letter of them doth import therefore it must be in this or else that sense which the letter of the words does not import somewhat they would say but they cannot tell what somewhat it is but no matter what so it be not the right meaning or true literal sense in a word all they have to trust to is their own muddy meanings foolish figments false unccuth imports on plain phrases which none but that some will need at all to mistake which who is such a fool as to be taken with the of them may take and who will not may safely let alone and every wise man will feel to be foolish and every reasonable man will refuse as so


tis to be noted that when the proper ordinary literal sense of any words do but seem to tend toward their own turns our divines insist much upon that intent and purport of them though they will needs make them mean another matter then they intend or truly import when the

true interpretation of them over turns and thwarts the tenure of their false doctrines and so rule their as they list according to their own unruly will and lay out the letter like a piece of lead into what shape sense or form seems good to their own lewd lesbian or petulant fancies and when it does not and handsomely to their particular private purpose one way they set it another and sometimes two or three wayes at once not determining which it is but saying its either this or that or both so io tom and bax page
that text iohn
may be understood of this light two wayes
all who are enlightned

the other sense is all sorts and nations but not that of the qua though the letter it self imports it but page
pamp both meanings are the holy ghosts the phrases will bear either senses and either of them cross the qua interpretation and when they deem they can make any use to help their crazy cause by the literal sense and import of the words then they will have that and so what a deceitful deal there is with t.d about the import of the words a very boy may behold up and down in his two trisles page
pamp
that expression luke
may import that the kingdome which the pharisees did upon a mistake look for without them was indeed mark a kingdome within them

here it seems t.d unawares thought the import of the expression would have served his turn and was mistaken it serving the qua for truth whereupon upon second thoughts as he sayes gives another which he judges the most genuine interpretation en vmin among you so the preposition may be rendred quoth he when as there's no such preposition at all as en in that text it being entos vmon as is shewed above
so page
the phrase doth not import the perfection of any on earth that likes him not it seems but else the phrase imports it well enough for he sayes ye are come to the spirits of just men made perfect as its said the saints are all to come up to the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ heb

pamp as the apostles expression is there he is for the import of the expressions so page
pamp
the expressions of freedome from sin do not note freedome from the being but dominion of sin
page
pamp
as for the phrase in your hearts it imports but the same with that expression the eyes of your understanding being enlightned
page
doth not commit sin that cannot be meant of freedome from sin but either there is an emphasis in the word sin intending under that general term one kind or sort of sin i.e the sin unto death or if not in the substantive then on the verb poiei which notes to make a trade of sin as the priests do who preach sin up and down for money so somewhat it is if they could tell what and no matter what nor where the emphasis lyes whether we can distinctly tell yea or nay so we may keep that doctrine of sufficient grace against sin to all men and that danmable doctrine of devils that is of not sinning any more which the qua teach up among men from taking too much root and bringing forth fruit to perfection of holiness that spoils all their ading as well as the lawyers which stands but upon mens trespasses and

sins if once men come to leave sinning and hating and envying and stealing and come to live in love innocency honesty and peace that marres their ministry therefore they'l beware of that leven however which will sowre all the sweet success that they have from generation to generation into the popish preferments of their deceased predecessors if that way be shewed how to live without sin it turns their rich trade of preaching down sin and talking against sin up by the roots and therefore though their trade is for money to declare against sin yet they must preach it up and talk for it a little too and do their work not too hastily all at once left there be no more work for them ere long to do but such as they were never bred up to live by

thus not only t.d i.o r.b.i.t but in a manner all our literal preachers when the letter leans not that way themselves for their lusts sake list to have it make no more to wrest it besides its own ordinary proper and literal and import which when it smiles with them they plead as much as they implead it when it makes against them then a man need do to turn a nose of wax which way he will and no less then twenty wayes one after another if they please yea it is but saying when they are minded so to do upon mislike of the spirits plain naked honest meaning thus viz
the spirit does not mean here as he sayes but means another thing tis usual with christ to speak words of a doubtful sense his meaning may be mistaken when his words taken in the most ordinary and literal sense and so it would be if by every man we should understand every individual man the meaning of words cannot be as the letter of them does import then this and that absurdity would follow say our reconciling by which they import themselves to be very little insighted either into the letter it self which they are ministers meerly of and much less into the mind of the spirit which gave it forth which never does as these and opinionists would make it speak one thing and mean another but means truly what he sayes though his very sayings are mysteries to the misty ministers when he sayes all and every man he means not some only a few one of a thousand as the personal electionists do who extend the large love of god so far as to say its intended but to few and streighten the boundless mercy of god into a which is stretched out matchlessly beyond measure over all his works which universal terms all men every man if they were to be restrained as they tell us how much more legally may indefinite terms be taken in a restrained sense and be made equivalent to particulars and upon that account we may except the most sinners as they indeed do some of them personally and absolutely from all iudgement and condemnation and the most as absolutely from mercy and salvation from the fear of any evil befalling them for their sins so as to say when god speaks indefinitely he will rain snares fire brimstone storm and temptest on the wicked that's not all and every wicked man but a few only therefore fear not and adulterers god will judge lyars murderers have their part in the lake that's but some few only at least not all nor the most not the saints not his upright hearted davids when gone from their uprightness for so david was in that matter of vriah when guilty of murder and adultery therefore droop not ye murderous

adulterous saints of this english israel if god had said all and every adulterer and every murderer hee'll judge and divide him his portion in the lake his meaning had not been as those words import tis usual for christ to speak words of a doubtful sense ye mistake his meaning if you understand him according to the ordinary and literal of the universal terms all and every man as speaking of every individual man but he speaks but indefinitely sinners whoremengers adulterers murderers not expressing all and every such a one which had he exprest he had dot implyed though the terms import so for he offers one thing oft when he means another offers that to all in words in his revealed will which in heart and his secret will he intends but to a few and if an universal cannot without going aside from the literal sense it imports yet the indefinite phrase hath a restrained

ob nay this cannot be though in the other case it may because this is contrary to the faith the other is not and we must keep to the analogy of faith in our interpretings of the scriptures

rep herein ye are more miserably bemoped and befool'd if ye could once see it then in all other your absurdities put together for whence or from what church principle ground foundation comes that faith according to the analogy of which ye are to conform in your interpretations of the scripture it must be either the infallible chair and bottomless pit of mens dunghilly traditions which is the foundation of the church of rome and her faith which foundation church and faith that's built on it ye would seem in words at least to deny or else the infallible light and spirit of god in the heart which the letter came from and the qua according to the letter and together with it call men to and are themselves as to their faith founded on whom together with their faith which stands not in mens words writings nor thoughts but in that light which is the power of god and that foundation of it also with no less but a little more detestation ye deny or else the scripture it self which as much as ye live by yea by popish tradition in many things as the papists do yet in words ye own
now the two first being denyed this last is the rule of your faith according to the tenor and analogy of which the churches faith which ye must interpret scripture by is to be framed and conformed see then your most abominable confusions and rounds ye run in
you have the scripture before which the true faith was delivered to the saints a years which scripture is the foundation of your church faith whereby ye might see were ye not blind that your church and faith has not the same foundation as the true had next you have a faith which must be squared by the best interpretations ye can make of that scripture alias a common stock of divinity that stinks as the blood of a dead man that hath no life in it then again this scripture by the analogy of which as the church interprets it your churches faith is to be framed must be bent to and interpreted by the analogy of that faith which was thereby framed so riddle me riddle me what's this round of our reasonless rabbies
the scripture is the rule of our faith say they according to our churches interpretations of which her common faith must as to the articles of it be framed and conformed

the common faith

is the rule according to the analogy of which the scripture must be interpreted and all our expositions of it framed and conformed oh the bruitish brainy notions of our of our brittish nation a false faith about personal election and reprobation about alls signifying some men only and every man only a few being framed in iohn calvins fancy upon his miserable mistakes and misinterpretations of the scripture scilicet ever since all scripture must be interpreted according to the analogy of that false faith a ferunt ignoramus and others

the blood of christ cleanseth us in presenti from all sin that's the guilt say they not filth of it though the very imports otherwise cleanse your selves from all uncleanness of flesh and spirit that's not as the letter imports all indeed but all gross iniquities we must have our infirmities while we live here and and if he meant them he commanded impossibilities which the apostle did not he that sinneth is of the devil he that's of god sins not that's not as the word amartanei nemine imports but it must be expounded by the other phrase amartian poiein operam dare peccato which amartian poiein but that they stretch it out upon the tenters is no more then amartanein for he that sins does sin and he that commits sin does no more and does so much as that while he does sin he is as christ said iohn
a servant of it and not of christ in that they do no iniquity that is not as the letter but they do none as the wicked do it that is with all their might but more moderately perfection that's only such an uprightness and sincerity as respects all gods commandments whether they be kept or broken saved from sin is from the dominion not being of it while we have a being here it hath not potestatem dominandi nor damnandi but operandi bellandi captivandi only led paul captive while he liv'd to the law of it so that with his flesh he served it but it domineers not damns not because the mind approves it not while the flesh commits it if it chance to be murder and adultery as that of david whose heart was upright say they though the scripture excepts him from uprightness in that case and therefore iustified quoth alias held guiltless while under the guilt of it being weak and temptation strong and an hundred more such fetches do our formally holy fathers find wherewith to feed up and their failing flocks from fainting under their lest faults into the name of saints infirmities

thus they swim up and down in their senses and notions so that nothing must be taken as the words import but when a meaning serves their licenticus turns and then they urge the words import it so one while it must be as the phrase imports other whiles it cannot be so but otherwise then the letner imports it for then the scripture so it seems indeed to the owls and batts whose eyes dazle at the light it came from so that they see more by night then by day would contradict it self and be at variance and disagree within it self and cannot approve it self to their own understandings without the mediation of their own meanings and inter+pretations and therefore they must reconcile it to it self though they are at never so much odds among themselves and each man within himself about

this matter of setting it to rights even one saying this is the meaning the other that a third in my opinion it is so a fourth think it must be either so or so but which he determines no more then till they have reconciled it into nothing but an irreconcileable enmity with it self and an occasion of irreconcilable enmity about it between themselves

and this know not only as one of those that now see in the lords light their dotage herein and the wrong and crooked wayes wherein they are at work to set that to rights and strait which is so already in itself if they could let it alone without wresting it into constructions as crooked as they are in their conversations but as one that was once as busie as the best of them in the same blind fruitless frothy work of beating the brains about the meaning of this and that which the spirit only reveals to the poor in spirit and not to the proud haughty scorner that dealeth in proud against the righteous having been my self when was where they yet are who where now am cannot come but with the losse of that life they yet live and through the death of a crosse thereunto looking and skimming and scraping among the learned scribes into the scripture for the sense of it without the spirit can tell them by experience as well as by the light in which it is seen and told them by my self and many more to what little purpose or profit either to themselves or their people who pay for it they are by the best improvment of their natural capacities academical parts and such meer animal accomplishments into the privities of the scriptures which according to os and specially ds his principles and way of interpretation and giving meanings is more made to patronize and partize with the transgressions of supposed saints then to promote the perfect purging from them in this world which yet the scriptures truly plead not only a possibility but a necessity of before men die unless they mean to die for ever when and his abettors implead it as a very doctrine of devils pleading rather because an impossibility of living without it a necessity of living in it while in the body
which said doctrine of perfectior or full pardon from sin here shall have a few words about with by and by after an addition of some few arguments more in proof of the universality of gods love in the of christ for all and of the gifts of his saving grace or light sufficient to lead all that follow it to life vouchsafed to every man and some brief animadversion of what more our four fore named antagonists argue to the contrary

arg
if christ died not for the whole world and for all and every man in it but for a few only and god gave him not a light to be his salvation as it is said isai to all the ends of the earth all which also he calls to look to him and be saved isa to hear him that their souls may live to come to him even whoever will that they may find rest and have of the water of life freely isai

then the world and most men who generally are damned for this very sin even because they believe not in hear not look not come not to christ iesus iohn
iohn
are damned for not looking to coming to nor believing

in their saviour when yet they had no saviour of theirs to look at or come to or believe in

but all men have a saviour to believe in and look to and come to which for not hearing looking nor coming to nor believing in they are damned yea this is the worlds condemnation that light is come into it yet the world comes not to the light otherwise as tis sottish absurdity and lamentable mockage to call all to look and come to and believe in him so such inconceivable cruelty as absit blasphemia far be it from us to think there is in god to damn them upon the account of not coming or in him therefore he is given a light a ransome a saviour for all and every man
arg
if it be a lie that christ died for every man as we say he did and a truth that he died but for a few only as they hold then sith god requires on pain of damnation so to believe if every man should believe christ died him god on pain of damnation requires most men to believe a lye and damns them for believing the very truth viz that he died not for every of them and for not believing that which if they all had believed the most of them had believed a lie
but absit blasphemia god damns no man for believing the truth or for not believing that which if they did all believe most of them must necessarily and believe a lie
therefore christ did undoubtedly die for every man and not for a few only
arg
if the redemption and salvation by the death and blood of christ which we confesse actually to extend to none but such as actually believe be not truly given from god to every man as his as well as any man so that at least every man may really have it if he will then either it is
because christ is not a ransome sufficient to save all or
because god wills and desires not that should save every man which is sufficient so to do or else
because most men neglect that so great salvation and put it away from themselves and will not have it when god would they should and thereby judge themselves unworthy of it or
else for some other reason
but tis not the first for your selves and all men confess a sufficiency of redemption and salvation in christ for all men nor the second for that were to make god whose wayes are all exact and equal so inequal in his doings as no wise man is to cut out a plaister as broad as a bushel to lay to a scare no broader then a shilling or rather upon your principles of unavoidble sorer condemnation to the reprobate part of the world by christs coming into it to save it then if he had never come a saviour into it at all to provide a plaister sufficient to heal the whole sore with an intent effectually to heal some very small part of it only but to render all the residue more outragious and farre sorer or to pay a ransome sufficient to redeem a thousand prisoners for debt with intent actually to set some one at liberty and for ever lay all the rest up closer prisoners in the dungeon
which absurdity and mockage and perfect hatred under pretence of love too far be it from any good man to father and fasten upon god and from me to fasten on any good man that in the least measure is merciful as god is merciful
moreover deus nil facit

if ye say the third ye say no otherwise then that truth with us that yet ye fight against viz
that god as he has provided life in his son so he is as truly willing all men should live but that some will die and would gather men unto life save only that they themselves will not

if any other thing be the reason why every man may not as truly be saved by christs death as any man it lies in you to assign it know none
therefore christ died intentionally to save every man
arg
if all men are not put into possibility of life by christs dying intentionally for every one of them if themselves chuse not death then it could not be said as by sin condemnation is come on all men so justification of life is come on all men and that the gift of gods grace and gift of god in christ and the benefit and blessing is every way at least as large and some wayes larger and abounding beyond the mischief and curse that comes by the sin
but it is in effect so said rom
therefore all and every man is made as capable to be saved by christ as every man is liable to be damned by reason of the sin
arg
christ could not be truly or properly said to be the propitiation for the sins of the whole world nor the saviour of the whole world to be given a covenant to the people a witnesse to the people a leader and commander to the people a light to the nations gods salvation to the ends of the earth much lesse could all people in any consistency with mercy or ut prius without foolery and mockery of most men in the midst of their remediless misery be bid to behold him or all the ends of the earth be summoned with promise yea assurance of salvation if they do and on pain of more cruel damnation if they do not to look and come to him for it and hearken to his voice or else be cut off in all things whatever he saith to them and such like unless he were truly properly and intentionally at least given to be all this to all men all the people the whole world and every man in it
but he is said so to be as abovesaid to all and all people even all ends of the earth are on such promises and penalties summoned to behold him look come and hearken to him as aforesaid isai

iv

os ds ts bs and all other our common adversaries common exceptions are but frivolously foolish boyish toyish shameful tergiver sations and as senseless as helpless escapes when they tell us the whole world iohn
is meant of the gentiles only as in opposition to the iews not

only for our sins that is of us iews say they but also for the sins of the whole world that is of the gentiles which division there savors of enough for iohn writes that epistle not more peculiarly or specially to the iewish then to the gentile believers as he must be understood to do if their sense on that clause were true but promiscuously and generally to all the saints among both whereupon it is superscribed the generall epistle of iohn but the distinction there made relates to all men in the world and vnbelievers of what nation soever for all whom while they are yet sinners enemies by wicked works he died and became a a sacrifice a light that all men in him might believe and thorough faith in his light might be saved quoad posse potentially or if they will whether actually or quoad esse they ever are saved yea or nay though he prayed not for the world as it lies in enmity and but for such only as come out of the world and the wickednesses thereof and that in all ages believe on his name thorough the one word as iohn
neither pray for alone that do now believe but for all that ever shall believe that they may be one in us

for as mysterious a riddle as this is to our rabbies who cannot see wood for trees yet christ can be truly said to die for men in some cases and conditions qua talibus whom qua talibus as in the same cases and conditions considered he cannot pray for that in that state they may be one with him and god who can have no unity with iniquity he stands in esse actuali actually offered up a ransome a propitiation for the sins of the whole world even in that state while it lies in enmity and wickedness as yet unreconciled to god by whose giving himself that way all men may be reconciled to god through faith in him whether ever they will be reconciled yea or nay but howbeit he may wish so well to his adversaries as to die for them that they in that way of faith might live through him and may wish also that they would believe that so in that way they might be forgiven yet he stands not actually nor immediately an advocate making actual intercession for any that they immediately or in their present state may stand accepted with the father but for such only as already actually do believe wherefore iohn sayes with appropriation of to himself and other saints as are found confessing and repenting their sins we have an advocate with the father even iesus christ but of all men without exception without limitation of christ to himself and other saints the same is the not for our sins only ours who do already own and have believed in him but also for the sins of the whole for all other mens sins as well as ours whether ever they own and believe in him so farre as to have any actual benefit by him yea or nay
besides if we grant them whose sense on it is otherwise as we are free to do it being a though not the distinction there intended their own distinction of that clause not ours only but also of the whole world into the iews and gentiles their own distinction is enough to fnd themselves as to the question in hand for the whole world being divided into iews and gentiles iews and gentiles are termes comprehen and conclusive of the whole world and of no lesse then every individual therein as well as any man

and as for their some of all nations some of all ports some iews some gentiles and among gentiles of every country tongue kindred and condition some not all of all kindreds countrys conditions not each man between this and the utmost parts of the earth as the literal sense of that phrase all the ends of the earth imports but here and there some the elect a few in comparison of the rest that are left without any saviour or saving grace or sufficient light to lead them to life and so as personally decreed thereto left to perish doubly for not believing secundum te sacerdos in a saviour when they never had one the people some a poor pittance among all people not all the people without exception not the whole world but that whole small part of elect ones elected personally out of that whole a thousand to one whereof are as personally from of old for remedilesly reprobated and such like sowre stuffe and dark dribling as is found in this case among the divines as age away with it it is unsavory and stinks as a dunghill of doctrine and becomes in the sight of all but the blind as the blood of a dead man that hath no life in it at all and as little of that which is called common sense and reason and unworthy to have so much time spilt upon it as to be too particularly talk'd with or of any other return then to be returned back as deceit together with its father by whole sale into the deep from whence it came only there might be enough pickt out of it whereby to shew the shallownesse of its authors

we know well enough it is but few and some of every nation tongue kindred and people that are actually redeemed unto god but it is not because there is not redemption as truly intended as tendred to them as well as sufficiently purchased for them but because they put it away from themselves by not turning to the teachings of that light word and grace of god that is nigh in their hearts and brings it nigh unto them else all even gentiles as well as well as iews heathens and indians as well as english men and christians so called and among each of these all as well as any of them· some measure of that grace nigh them which in the least measure

is enough and sufficient to help and heal them were they as continually and earnestly within attendant on it as they commonly and eagerly ever turn outwards from it whereby it becomes to them of no effect when god either without or within or both calls upon all ends of the earth which word cannot be exclusive of any but must be conclusive of every individual to look in unto it and in it to look unto himself and to behold and hear him whom he hath given as a guide a light to shew good and evil a law a witness for god against them when they do evil within themselves a leader and commander to all people

object
tis not to all people but to the people an indefinite phrase that hath a restrained sense

rep
the indefinite phrase here hath an enlarged sense and is aequivalent to an universal isa
the people
answers to every one
and and if it were to be restrained there ought to have been some restrictive exceptive expression but there is an expresse enlargement and may as well mit it in other places as the churles with the evil instruments of their

own inventions do in these places so as when god sayes oft in the and elsewhere he cometh to judge the world in righteousness and the people with equity to say god will not judge all people nor the whole world and every individual but some few people only in righteousness and truth and so coop the wrath and judgement of god up into a corner and prate it as perversly into a pinfold as the priests of those piteous principles do his mercy who prate of a peremptory predestination without respect to sin or at least any other then adams personal act of most persons before they had any being remeditesly and unchangeably to damnation

what then do the quakers deny gods unchangeablenesse in his decree rep gods decree deny not to be unalterable but blind priests mistake that unchangeable decree of his which is to be toward men as they toward him merciful to the upright wrathful to the froward and wicked to shew himself in his love as a friend father forgiver for ever even inalterably unchangeably world without end to the penitent that turn to him and come to him by christ in his light keeping his commandements and as unalterably unchangeably without variation or shadow of turning that immutable mind and will of his to shew himself in his wrath everlastingly eternally to the finally impenitent sinners who are found living and dying in that seed which is unchangeably reprobated from him so whom he loves he loves to the end and whom he hates he hates to the end that is for ever but those whom from eternity he hath thus immutably decreed to love and own and honour to eternity are the righteous ones that honour him the godly in all ages whoe're they are which are those only that he chuses to himself psalm
whether foreseen who they will be in time by him or not that is nothing to the purpose and whom he thus as immutably from all eternity decrees to disregard hate and reject to eternity are the seed of evil doers that lightly despise him who are never to be renowned so whatever changes fall out among men who are sometimes better sometimes worse and among their states which are some good some bad there is no change in the mind of god what ever the thoughts of mens hearts are his unchangeable counsel stands the same his purpose and decree the same which is from eternity to own the good and refuse the bad to justifie the walkers in his light christ jesus and judge all that rebel against it so he doth not change his will but his unchangeable will to persons is to be unchangeably affected to them in either love or hatred respectively as they respectively are found at any time the subjects of sin or not and so consequently objects of either the one affection mutually or the other as if a king decrees after the manner of the medes and persians inalterably that his people shall have as they do he that does well shall be beloved and he that does ill and repents not from it shall be hated hanged one and the same person may at different times be under the two different affections viz now under the favour and now under the displeasure of the king as he does well or ill and by and by love and in his favour again as he repents or else as not repenting be so under his hatred as to be hanged yet the kings mind will and decree stands the same unchangeable as it ever did

so in the case in hand there's rei non dei a change of the case of mans will and manners and accordingly of his state or standing the object of either gods love or hatred under either his favour or displeasure but gods mind will decree counsel love and hatred stands unchangeably and everlastingly to the same subjects that were the objects thereof at first viz whether sinners or saints and thus god did not at all change in his decree mind will and purpose to perpetuate the priesthood to eli house for ever though he once said it should for ever and after said but now be it far from me forasmuch as his purpose was at first to continue it in case he honoured god in it and his unchangeable counsel is ever this viz
that those who honour me will honour but those that despise me shall be lightly regarded sam


ob
this gives the glory of salvation not to god but to mans will which is all in all then in the

rep
it's not for want of ignorance that the narrow noddles think thus for originally and supremely still the glory is to the universal grace of god who in his love freely to all men sends his son a light into the world and by him puts all as well as some into a capacity to live if they list and if any die then gods grace and love is nere the less for all that and though secondarily and immediately the case be left by the lord to depend on mans choice as it was in the first adam though yet know such as are perfectly restored by the second stand a little surer then he did say when perfected in his life yet if man chuse life and live when life and death are set before him as they are god is no more rob'd of the glory of his goodness then he would have been by adams standing if he had stood when god set him in aequi librio to stand or fall and made him upright as he has done undefined span alphabet not him only but mankind till they go out from him after their own inventions eccl
and that was not one jot at all for though the shame of adams sinning fell justly on himself yet the glory of his standing would have been to god who made him able to stand had he stood neither would adam had he stood have plaid the fool so as to fall a praising and thanking himself for the life and happiness he would have had but god who in his love and bounty originally stated him in it though for his misery he may as all men also most justly thank none but himself and the devil e.g
if should see two men ready to starve for want of money to trade with and out of true equal bowels of pity to them both should freely bestow an equal stock of money on them or if not equal yet so much to each at least that each using and improving well what he hath may come to live like a man one of them plays the good husband with what he has and thrives whom shall he thank when unavoidably else he had perisht for the money he had given him and now hath would you not think him a fool to fall a thanking himself never thinking on the man that first set him up of whom unless besides his wits he would say am bound to thank not my self that now live when my fellow starves but that honest man that took pity on me and him too if he he had but used what he had t'other spends all his portion in riotous living and is as likely to starve as ere he was for want of improving what gave him whom shall this man thank for his present

poverty me that gave him whereon to live or himself who lavish't it every wise man will see my love was nere the less and though he perish yet the thank that he might have liv'd belongs to anothers bounty and the thank shame sorrow of his own woe to himself alone israel thy destruction is of thy self but in me is thy help hos
that iudas is damn'd he may thank himself who sold his master as esau his birthright and blessing that peter and iacob live for ever the thank of this belongs only unto the grace of god

moreover if christ who is often either expresly or implicitly so call'd be not a saving light to the whole world the leader and commander and witness for and from god to all people without exception of any individuals among any people or in any nations would fain know of any one of these
how it can be truth which themselves are fain to confess that god will and doth in all nations out of every tongue kindred and people effectually save some and
in what manner or by what way means light or leader he leads them few of all families of the earth to life whom he doth save if it be not by that light law and spirit of life that is from christ some of which is in every as well as any conscience sith its evident that neither all nor half those nations in each of which some are saved have not the scripture or letter which they call the only saving light the way the rule foundation the most effectual means and in a manner every thing which the letter it self sayes christ only is indeed find telling us such a tale of the outward text as if in respect of the giving out of that only by the motion of his spirit through some holy penmen christ were the saviour and light of the world and of all men in it that are at all savingly enlightned and saved

we confess quoth he christ is the light of the world and so of all men in it because that light shining in the holy scripture is sufficient savingly to enlighten all men to whomsoever by the providence of god it shall come but to bespeak him in his own language to us more proper to himself and his followers then to us quod hoc ad fanaticorum delirium
what's this to that piece of dotage of himself and his fellow doctors who deny the vouchsafing of any saving illumination to most men yea to very many to one in the world scilicet a little deeper discovery of their dotage scriptura nempe

omnia belike deems all the ends of the earth to be so fully filled with his adored transcripts and texts of scripture that by them christ saves and enlightens all he saves which are say they in every nation some whereas ridiculum caput who knows not that the scripture or writing is so from appearing in every dark corner of the earth where affirm the true light shines in every conscience so that there's nor speech nor language where it shines not and the voice of christ the light may not heard that the text hath scarce been heard or of some few corners of this so call'd christian world which yet more only loving

the letter and hating the light are for all their letter as much as any in the unfruitful deeds of darkness also even until now

oh the inanity of these men call'd divines in the matters of god and the gospel as if the letter only were that voice of christ which is every where heard by some that light which in every nation savingly enlightens some that rule which all the world is required to walk by in order to peace and on pain of damnation which letter yet was never read or seen perhaps not so much as heard of in half the world the only rule of the whole whereof it is to be say they and not the light of christ in the conscience at any hand the expansion beams and rays of which but that few heed it and the darkness comprehends it not reach into the darkest inmost corners of each conscience throughout each corner of the whole creation
the letter is not in every nation to save some out of each or if it were and be the saving light whether men walk by it or not twould be a light to every as well as any man in each nation and so saving light though not used would contrary to os tale be vouchsafed by christ to every man in every nation but the light is not only in every nation but in every heart in each nation and because it is so though few are saved by it because few heed it yet every man may be saved by it as well as any man
arg
to conclude this then confess that tis either the letter that these scribes talk for or that light we talk for and they against which is that one only universal unchangeable infallible standing law light witness word guide rule touchstone and saving way to life in respect of which christ is said to be the leader commander and witness from god to all people the light of the whole world and consestuently of all men in it
but tis not the letter therefore tis the light we speak of in fuller proof of this last and disproof of the former consider the rule law light and means of life and salvation what ever it is must be adequate in its expansion and extent to the men that ought to be ruled guided led to life by it on pain of further perishing and cursing if they be not
but the light of christ in each conscience is so teaching there whatever god requires of each person as to his own peace and what god in the doing thereof will accept him in and the letter not so therefore the said light and not the letter is that by which christ is gods witness to the world and all peoples leader if they will follow him unto life
the plaster should be adequate to the sore and not short of it as the light is not but the letter is in its extent in respect to all ends of the earth else there's as much folly in this extreme as said above there would be in the other it being as little wisdome to be too short as to for a man to make a plaster no broader then a penny for a wound as broad as a crown piece as tis to cut a plaster of the compass of a bushel for a sore no broader then a six pence

that rule law light and word by which all are to live and be judged and tryed and for nor living by which to be condemned must universally

be extended to all and every man those who have a copy thereof without and those who have no such copy but are without it for lex papulus cujustex est verbum officium est illud dire obedire lux illuminandi mensura mersierandum regula prebandum debent esse adaequata the law and they to whom its given as that by which they must live or die for breaking it the and that are bound is hear and obey it the light and such are to see by it the rule and such men as well as manners as are to be measured and by it on peril of damnation if not agreeing with it must be so adequate that the rule law light word must by the providence of god be made to reach and extend to the corner in all ages wherein the men to whom its given are abiding that they may see it whether that be the letter without or the light within so that if that in the conscience we assert so to be be that saving light law means rule then it must be by the ordered to come within the cognizance of every man in the world who is to live or dye and as he keeps or breaks it to stand or fall by it for even if the scripture be it then that must be ordered to come as universally to all and every man otherwise as that king or parliament might be said to mock the nation and make it miserable that should make a certain law which whoever keeps shall live and who keeps not shall be hanged and yet keeps that law within the little corner of that city of westminster and and never suffers or orders the copy of it to come to the sight of others neither in our known nor yet so much as in an unknown tongue in one of which at least our english laws as much as they are lapt up not a little from the cognizance of poor people among the learned lawyers only as laps his lying labours learned and loud challenges against the quakers from the as he thinks within the cloud of his latine language or as that man who should in a dark night hang out one single candle in a lanthorn only for all london to see by or he that should preach at and command all ends of england at their peril to hear his voice from thence might truly be call'd a mocker

so to use os own words again ex

si scripturam vel ab omnibus percipi nolit tamen omnes qui doctrinam non observant vel ideo condemnas quid ni millies mille miseres homunciones deus per tale verbum medium regulam legem lucem ludos facere absit blasphemia oestimandus sit if god give out a law light rule word of life to all which he will condemn men not obeying and yet would not have it by all so much as to be seen why may not god be thought which were blasphemy to think to mock millions of men and make them miserable without their personal default by such a word means rule light or law which instead of going forth of sion and ierusalem to the whole earth is confin'd within the little hill of sion itself

but now the light within the letter calls all to is in all men the letter without not so universal but extending to very few therefore the light within not the bare letter without is that saving means word rule law besides if the letter were the law light word and rule which yet was never seen by most in most nations then that respect

to persons and nations which was once more to the iews then any people upon earth as to the giving out of a meer outward letter of his law to beep which respect was ended in christ who brake down that partition wall between iew and gentile eph is hereby set up again which woe be to him that builds when god hath destroyed up again that must not come for though he once gave his laws and statutes to israel in an outward letter and copy which thing he did not do to any people else nor other nation if will believe the scripture nor doth to any nation at all to this day at their sole rule and guide yet of a truth perceive saith peter act



and he who is not blinded may perceive it also that god is now no respecter of nations one above another nor of persons in the nations so as to give his statutes judgements laws rule and saving means of life if the letter were so to one nation or person and not in any measure to another but in every nation he that feareth god whose fear is to depart from what evil his light in the conscience makes manifest and worketh righteousness which none do who live not by that and all do who live by it for sin is no other then the transgression of that law which is the light is accepted with him

arg
again let me argue with thee out of thy own words if others will not answer affirmatively and assent to this as truth yet thou must who asserts it for truth thy self for this argument in verbis is no other then thine own for with reference to ioh
the very place that we argue the from thou thy self though intentionally against us yet unawares really arguest for us on this wife viz
the light and illumination mentioned in this place ioh
are spiritual without all controversie and pertaining to the regeneration by grace not natural and so pertaining to the creation for in the same sense

in which men are said to be darkness are they said to be enlightned else the apostles speech would be aequivocal but men are not said onely spiritually but universally also to be darkness therefore are they by christ not spiritually only but universally also enlightned
and as contrariorum eadem est ratio so contrariorum contraria est ratio not only in the same sense in some respects but also in other respects in the very contrary sense to that wherein men are darkned by the devil are they enlightned by christ but all mankind is not only spiritually and universally but also damnably darkned by the devil therefore mankind is not only spiritually and universally but also savingly enlightned by christ

from what hath been said and shewed above then affirm that the grace and light in the conscience which in some measure or other is from god and christ given in common to all men is not only universal but saving and though most are by it no more then accused reproved condemned and left without excuse and not nor saved yet there

wants not sufficiency in it to save and that men are not saved but mostly condemned by it tis only because they answer not the mind of god revealed in it but love the darkness more then it which they hate to come to as christ saves because their deeds are evill whereas did they but glorifie him answerably to what he requires of them who exacts nor expects from any the doing more of his mind and will then what he one time or other manifesteth to them to be his will concerning them in their own consciences they should not be without excuse nor stand condemned in gods sight but be accepted justified and saved from the wrath which comes only on the children of disobedience it being the power of god as sufficient to the excuse and salvation of those from sin and wrath that obey the measure of it in themselves as to subject those to accusation rejection judgement wrath and condemnation that rebel against it

to all the abovesaid arguments therefore shall subject this one after the prosecution of which in proof of the sufficiency of that light to save which is given in common to all men shall take some notice of bs and ts arguings to the contrary
arg
that light which rebel'd against sufficient to accuse and condemn and render a man guilty reprobate or reproved is if obeyed sufficient to excuse clear justifie save from condemnation and render approved
but the light in all is sufficient to condemn all that rebell against it therefore to save as abovesaid such as obey it
the minor is your own· the major shall proceed in proof of
and here since am so neer it shall take occasion to refell that foolish conceit and dream of our divines in which both thou are all four found for in most of this main matter of the light ye run parallel and are coincident except now and then a crosse whet each to other concerning the of the light to save however improved though yielded to be sufficient to leave excuselesse and condemn for here ye dance between these two stages still in your stickles with the qua against the light cutting capers to and fro with your legs acrosse and sliding out of one shift into another when they tell you the true light of god which is but one and that not natural but supernatural though in never so many different degrees in mens hearts is common to all ye yield for ye cannot stand against it that it is so but then it is not saving when they prove it saving ye yield it is saving but then not common which that it is both have shewed above against you all some words only here as to that absurdity it is sufficient to leave man inexcusable if not obeyed and to condemn him but not to save justifie or render him accepted if obeyed
that the whole body of the gentiles are enlightened and that by christ thou dost sometimes confess in terminis as have shewed above though at other times thou denyest it but thou addest
pamp not by christ with the knowledge of salvation alias secundaunte with a light sufficient to save salvation is of the iews i.e among such as have the letter only and by the law of the letter without speak but thy sense
pamp

also denies this same light however attended to to be sufficient

to bring to justification of life or salvation that still he ascribes to his only all sufficient greek and hebrew text and outward scriptures ex

lumen hoc utcunque ei attendatur non est ullo respectu salutare sed in rebus omnbius divinis finem ultimum quod attinet mera tenebra so
sufficientiam quidem habet ad antapologesian ad salutem this light indeed is sufficient to accuse and condemn but not so to save
so again pamp natural light so ye call it still is to this purpose to leave men without excuse rom
so that they cannot say as we suppose the heathens might had we known of a remedy for our misery we would have used it but as for salvation many ages and generations neuer had one offer of it and among those who hear the gospel it is offered to more then it is intended

and say the same
the gentiles light by nature so he calls it though insufficient to direct for iustification and salvation yet was useful for two ends


to restrain from sin

besides this end god hath another that they might be inexcusable who sinned against the light in them and god might be justified in his sentence and iudgement upon them rom
that might be without excuse who held the truth mark how the light in all is called the truth which men withhold in unrighteousness therefore it must be the righteousness of god it self that is revealed from heaven and justifies in unrighteousness and when they knew god glorified him not as god neither were thankful but were filled with unrighteousness though they knew the judgement of god that they that commit such things are worthy of death
whence it is that gods judgement is proved to be according to truth rom
and god found to be true though every man a lyar ignorance of the law mark again how they call it the law by which is the knowledge of sin the transgression of which is sin which paul calls spiritual holy just and good these men all but natural and sometimes no better then diabolical being not to be pleaded by them that sin against the innate light of their own spirits forasmuch as that fact must needs be voluntary which is done against the knowledge and judgement of a mans own conscience

thus far these men of the light within it condemns say they but cannot save accuses cannot excuse
rep monstrum horendum cui lumen ademptum what are our ministers become monsters now adayes that take on them the name of seers for poor people and yet have never an eye to see the truth withall themselves is there any law in the world that being broken brings penalty accusation cursing judgement or condemnation upon the transgressors that does not as well hold acquit clear justifie and save from the said cursing and condemnation its obeyers and observers


consider its impossible that any light should leave without excuse and condemn a man when sinned against and not excuse justifie and keep out of condemnation when it's answered for what wot can condemn that man who walks up in exact obedience to that law or measure of light be it never so little which is lent him in particular to live by where there is no law nor light at all there is no sin imputed rom
where

no law is broken there is no transgression to condemnation for such sin is anomia no other then the transgression of the law and that in such particulars only wherein it is made known for to him that knows to do good and doth it not to him it is sin iam
not to him that never did nor could for if abimelech had took to himself abraham wife for his own not knowing but that she was his sister only as she said he had been clear and not guilty nor had sin been impured to him or laid to his charge to condemnation though the fact had been sin in it self yet not sin unto his whereupon he pleads when the lord comes by the light the thing upon him wilt thou slay a righteous nation in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my have done this and god answers yea know thou didst it in the integrity of thy heart gen

can that possibly leave men without excuse or plea for themselves in their condemnation when god comes to enter into judgement with them that must be understood and believed by them never to have put them by the best improvement thereof and attendance to it as and say the light of god in all does not utcunque cui attendatur so much as in possibility of salvation nor was sufficient had they never rebelled against it to have excused and acquitted them in the sight of god cannot they that have no light and grace more then what had they obeyed and answered it would not have rendred them accepted in his sight they being also personally particularly peremptorily predestinated to be damned and to be disobedient to the light that they might be damned as our divines say from pet

iude
when god comes to plead in no other but a righteous way against them and to damn them for that sore appointed disobedience to it and to reckon and reason with them thus why would you die and not live a live had much rather ye should have lived then died but that ye would your selves destroy your selves when in me was help and would have helped you and therefore sent my son a light to lead you to life not to condemn but to save you had you walked in it for hating and want of walking in which alone it is that ye now must be condemned for ever had not sent you light and spoken to you by my self and son you had had no sin but now seeing ye knew my will and did it not in the doing of which ye should have entred my kingdome but stopt your ears closed your eyes despised my counsel set at naught all my reproof to you this is sin for which he have no cloak plea nor excuse or if you have let us hear it

say cannot such plead again lord it is true thou art out soveraign and mayest do with thy own as a potter with his clay and dash us to pieces at thy pleasure but thou art also a god of righteousness and truth who hast said thou wilt do right as the judge of all the earth and thou wilt not do that thy self which thou damnest others for doing as thou didst pharoah for requiring men to make such a tale of brick as they had not sufficiency of straw for and we hope thou wilt not damn us for not doing what thou know'st we never could being never sufficiently impowered by thy self we trust thou wilt not condemn us at least not with the sorer condemnation as accessary to our own death and for not coming to christ that we might have life and for want of coming to the saving knowledg of thy self mind and will and for not obeying the gospel of our lord jesus

and for nor coming to him in his light and not believing in him as our saviour and for want of improving our talents to the utmost to our salvation for of which alone and for to which light and gospel alone and only in which christ thou now tellest us we must perish which gospel had we obeyed which christ had we believed in as our which saving knowledge of thee if we had had which talent or talents had we improved to the best we should not have perisht but have had everlasting life as it was told us for truth from thee by these that say they are thy ministers if they did not lie and however they made us believe so that we were never put into any capacity for life and salvation by all that best grace that thou vouchsafedit to they told us not only that many ages and generations never had one offer of salvation from thee but also that in these very nations where thy gospel rich grace and large love as they call it at least is proclaimed and held forth in words proffers preachings and pretences to all yet there is not one of an hundred that is as they say no more then the personally elected ones which are very few also as they say in comparison of the rest that were a certain determinate but much more numberlesse number also as unchangeably reprobated from everlasting without reference to good or evil foreseen to be done by them in time that the salvation so universally offered in thy name was ever so truly intended to by thee as it was tendred and that the saviour of the world of whom they say he came to save not the righteous but sinners and ungodly ones to seek out that which is lost and of whom they say thou in thy love sentest him not to condemn but save the world was sent to save none but that foresaid few set number of elect ones of which number we could find little ground to hope we were sith an hundred to one were not any more then if an hundred were sentenced to die and but one of them to be saved and a pardon should be proclaimed to them all conditionally that every man believed for himself that he were the man to whom the pardon is intended any one man could have ground of confidence that himself was he and so we were quite discouraged by the preachers of thy grace from believing the salvation to be intended to us since an hundred to one it was not and they told us that the said saviour did not die for all but for a few even the said choice ones whereupon though he was held forth to us all to be believed in as the common salvation in thy revealed will as they call it on pain of eternal condemnation to every one of us that should not believe in him as our lord and our god and saviour and with promises or eternall life to us all conditionally we would all so believe yet we could not see how this could rationally hang together or how we could all truly have believed such a thing every man of us for himself without the most of us should have believed a lie and we thought whatever they said that thou wouldst have us all believe no more then the truth and not have any of us believe much lesse be damned for not believing a lie we could not see though they bad us every one believe in christ as ours how the most of us had a christ to believe in as ours sith they told us he was not intended to all to whom he is offered but to a very few even of them since we were by themselves who bade us believe in him every of

us as our salvation bad to believe this doctrine also on pain of being held armenians socinians and hereticks in the church that he did not offer himself a ransome for all as the scripture in plain terms sayes he did but as much as be is offered to us all yet he offered himself not for all but only for the foresaid few and that by and every one in the scripture and the lost ones and sinners and ungodly and the whole world which he is said to die for we must at no hand understand indeed nor think that thy meaning was as thy words imported nor according to the literal sense of them for then we might mistake thee but that by all and every one the whole world thou meanest but a very few only and by sinners and ungodly thy elect ones only neither could we see upon the account of their personal particular principles as universal as thy tenders of christ to us all were or at least theirs in thy name that we could possibly believe the truth if we should all have believed in him as ours or that we could all have a share in him and we saw that it being so that he was not intended to be a saviour to every man to whom he is offered some men had no saviour to believe in as their and for ought we saw twas an hundred to one but we might be the men and to believe it that he was ours we had no ground from their doctrine for such a faith and so might if we had yea must most of us if we had believed it have believed a lye and tho sayest thou wilt damn men for not believing the truth and wilt thou now damn all us for believing the truth for he was not intended by thee if our ministers did not belye thee to us to be our saviour who are reprobates and we did believe him not to be so according as it proves and so our faith was of the truth and if we all had believed it that he died for every of us it had been a lye if our learned leaders did not lye and wilt thou now damn us for not believing that which if we had believed all of us an hundred to one but the most of us must have believed a lye and that which was not so if we had believed it we had been deceived for twas not so it their doctrine be true and now we did not believe it we are to be condemned because we believe not in thy son and apply him not every one to our selves in particular to whose salvation he was never appointed but in thy unalterable decree before ever we were born though offered to us a ours upn equal terms as they say with the elect whose only in particular designed altogether to another purpose even to be the salvation of some few but the unavoidable further condemnation of us reprobates and only to leave us the more excuseless in our suffering of it

and howbeit its true we did not obey the gospel nor do thy will we must need confess in order unto life yet it was never savingly nor sufficiently manifested to us in all our lives as they said nor was any measure of that true light in which is the life nor one grain of that as our divines told us which is sufficient for us to bring us to life vouchsaf'd but a natural light in attending to which had we ever so well heeded or improved it twould not have helpt us imparted to us only a certain common grace and light as they told us which had we answered it could have avail'd us nothing as to salvation and a talent which had we traded with as they tell us and doubled it encreased into but more of the same kind and common sort not

obtain'd any
special nor what ere the scripture seems to say to the contrary which we poor ignorants durst not presume to walk by our sense of but to take as interpreted by our textmen and churchmen have let us into thy joy

and whereas thou swearest thou wouldst not have had us died but much rather lived if we would had we but known indeed as we never did sith we were told that was a most fearful damnable doctrine that we had had but arbitrium liberatum a freed will vouchsafed us from thee whereby to chuse life when life and death was set before us or but a power wrought in us from thee to have will'd and done what thou requiredst we might happily have chosen life and have come and to turn'd thee then we had either turned to thee or else been utterly inexcusable we confess and thy wayes had been as equal as thou sayest they are and our blood had been altogether on our own heads and our destruction of our selves alone had there been but any of that sufficient help that is in thee vouchsafed to us from thee it would habe been tryed then whether we would have turned to thee or no but alas lord thou know'st we were told and we thought it our duty on pain of damnation to take all for truth that our and and learned doctors and well read men in the scriptures and minister told us that all men had not and that few have so much as sufficient light or power at all to will or do or think good communicated to them from thee we know indeed that without thee nothing can be done and that all mans sufficiency to good must come from thee but now thou queriest of us why we did not do thy will and wilt judge us for the neglect of it we beseech thee lord consider and pity us we never knew yee that we were under power and possibility form the most and best and greatest measure of ability grance and light given to us to know or do that will thou now art going to require with vengeance the violation of at our hands for if it were so as some said indeed viz the qua seeming also to bring scripture for it that we and all men have or had though of our selves yet some and so much in our selves of it as we should have stood justified accepted uncondemned in improving and not have had that sin thou sayest we have now no cloak for had we known it we hope we should have done according to it but being out of hope of having strength to overcome we sate still in and despair for our ministers told us the qua were lyar's and seducers not to be believed and their doctrine damuable ministers belyed thee to us as a hard master reaping where thou hast not sowed and gathering where thou hast not strawed and requiring that of us even that we should turn to thee and live which thou as they say dost not enable by light and grace enough or suitable thereto scarce one of a thousand and so we were disheartned from trading with the talent we had and hid and laid it not out as believing we had as good do nothing at all as nothing to the purpose and upon many more such like considerations as there seeing we were by our ministers telling us of life and tendring it to us yet telling us as their faith and as that which must be ours that it belongs but to few and that this was thy secret will whatever thy revealed will was they profested also to be men acquainted with thy secrets we gave our selves over to security to eat and drink

and do no good and satisfie our wills in evil for let us do better or worse or the best and most which the best and most of any of us reprobates could do we saw we could but die and if we happened not to be of the few elected on es to life that are ordain'd to be brought to it some time or other as a thousand to one we saw we were not we must unavoidably die and perish without hope or remedy from such evil communications of our clergy which corrupted good manners concluding that we could do no good without thee and had no grace to do good given us from thee we said let us eat and drink for tomorrow we therefore let us be excused lord and held guiltless the rather because we were in ignorance and unbelief of this truth that we could do ought towards our own salvation by any power or measure of sufficient grace imparted to us from thy self or at least shew us mercy as thou didst to paul who obtained it of thee that in him thou mightest shew forth an example of thy goodness and patience to poor sinners in to come even to that ever should live ungodly tim

for as he so we seeing our teachers traduced us so to think of the qua that now we find hold the truth innocently or as least ignorantly that they were enemies to god christ scriptures word of god righteousness of christ iustification by him alone seduced and seducres and the vilest persons on earth and so thought verily that we did thee service in persecuting killing stoning stocking mocking haling them out of synagogues and into prisons little deeming what we now see that men are not accepted and condemned the more for not knowing so much as our professors tell us of this and that notion of doctrine and point of divinity in the head as for not doing that be it little or more that is already made known with all the heart and that had we done thy will but so far as made known we as christ said indeed should have known more and more of the different doctrines that were which were of god and which men for meer money and maintenance flesh and livelihoods sake taught only of themselves

say may not the reprobates even in these nations so plead and can the light and grace of god given and tendred to them leave them without excuse at all if it be not at all sufficient if never so well improved to lead them to life and salvation can the law in their hearts accuse them doing ill and not justifie them doing well will it kill them if they break it and kill them if they obey it also but how much more excuse the poor ethnicks as ye call them that have nothing but that light within of nature as ye term it which ye your selves sometimes seem to confess and say excused them as page
we may suppose the heathen might say had we known of a remedy we would have made use of it yea thou deniest not nor do any of you but that the work of the law written in the hearts of all is accusing and excusing and that the said law within is sufficient to both these page
owns the same saying that by the light within the heathens thoughts excuse or accuse according as the thereby enlightned bears inward witness both of the ius and the fact and that the moral instinct of good and evil that is within by that is seconded by a an inward justifying clearing and acquitting as its answered or else a terrifying and condemning as its transgrest this therefore is another argument of the common lights sufficiency to save from condemnation

such as walk by it from which may conclude it

that which can and doth excuse its observers does not only serve to restrain sin and to leave he transgressors of it without excuse but also save from condemnation but the law in the heats of heathens excuses it observers witness rom
from which place ye are fain all to confess the same where its said that by the work of the law which the heathen shewed written in their hearts their inward thoughts not only accuse but excuse yea very ethnicks are not left without plea or excuse by it if it be not sufficient to save as is shewed above asd as confesses page

we may suppose quoth he the heathen might say had we known of a remedy we would have made use of it therefore it not only leaves without excuse when men violate it but saves from condemnation such as obey it

the light condemns the heathen when they it but cannot save them though they do obey it indeed he adds without christ and so say too but that light is in them from christ and so if it save them as it does if they obey it it saves them not without him for its he that saves them by it but our diviners divine enough to the contrary to the utter confutation of themselves in this when by their own confession the common light in the conscience they more commonly then properly call natural doth not only accuse such as go from it but also excuse such as keep to and walk by it within themselves for is not iustification noncondemnation absolution and consequently salvation from guilt and wrath where excusation is as well as guilt wrath and condemnation where accusation and no excuse is it possible there should be any condemnation where no transgression but an answering to the law lent men to live by for sin as before is but the transgression of the law or light that every one hath and as where no law is so where no breach is of the law where it is there's no transgression and where the conscience gives a good answer and the heart by the light in it that shews ius and factum condemns not doth god condemn is there not acceptance boldness and confidence toward him as there is fear terrour wrath and condemnation from god where it doth condemn yea your selves confess it yet the law in the heart the light is sufficient to accuse yea and excuse well and ill doing respectively but not to save justifie or give life say our light treacherous prophets dark divines and lifeless leaders
ob
the letter kills cannot give life

rep true but why is it but because its desobeyed and cannot give ability to any to do what it requires the law or light and gospel and all kills such as transgress it say the gospel it self condemns but whom is it none but such as hate and take not heed to it that thereby they may come from under the curse and death into the life it calls for else it being the power of god to the salvation of such as believe in it life should be by the light one way more then it could come by by the letter for the letter could keep them that keep it from the curse denounced in it to the breakers of it yet cannot give any an ability to keep it but the

light is not only able to acquit justifie clear absolve secure and save from wrath all such as believe in and obey it but al to enable such as look to it and impower them more and more to obey and walk by it and consequently by the letter which cannot be transgressed by such as abide in the light all such as singly come to it and continue waiting on the lord in it

object
the law cannot give life if it could righteousness should be by the law gal

rep true the law in the letter the old testament which he there speaks of as in opposition to the new which is the gospel the light and spirit cannot in regard of the weakness of flesh to fulfil it and its weakness to enable any to the fulfilling of it for the righteousness declared and required therein must be performed or else it utters nothing but accusation and cursing and yet to perform that righteousness the letter can no wise impower
but the law which is the light in the spirit that is and comes from christ into the conscience is the law of life forasmuch as howbeit it taketh vengeance en mens inventions and ministers first judgement and condemnation to the transgressors for transgression and wrath on the evil doer and his evil deeds yet when it hath condemned sin in the flesh wherein it is committed so long till it hath condemned it out of the flesh and brought forth judgement in that wait on it unto victory over the sin that is judged it ministers the righteousness and the peace and the liberty from the sin and the life of god it self it requires calls for and through the judgement leads too and then justifies those whom it hath this way enabled to perform it
in both which respects though the law of the letter is not so yet the law of the spirit of life which is the light in christ and in us from him sith it both
enables the followers of it to fulfil it and
secures from wrath and condemnation the fulfillers of it who e're they are iew or such as have the letter without or have it not that obey it it is not sufficient only to accuse the rebels against it undefined span alphabet and condemn them within themselves but also as utterly insufficient to save and bring to life utcunque ei attendentes such as never so punctually observe and perform it as our preachers prate it is altogether even every way sufficient to save to the utmost all such as come to god by christ from whom it comes and to christ in it according to rom
there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ iesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for law of the spirit of life in christ iesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit

thus then it is evident that the law of god which is not the letter of it but the light is powerfull and sufficient to save save only that men turn from and transgresse it and that it is universal and in all men is as evident out of rom
where it is said that those ye call heathen who have not the outward literal copy of it do shew the work of the law written in their

hearts which of the law who yet grants the law it self to be spiritual in his meer natural understanding calls natural as if the work of the law of god which is spiritual and perfect were not spiritual as the law it self is which work or effect of the law psalm

from that into another swinish brutish nature even the nature and image of the serpent the subtillest of beasts of the devil and satan himself and so of men as they were made become beasts of the field and of noble vines of gods planting in his garden at first and wholly a right seed turning from the light into the darkness of their own vain thoughts and imaginations became a seed of evil doers and a degenerate plant of a strange vine unto the lord in which corrupto and by which contrary nature not created by god but contracted to themselves the other nature image and glory of god which when man sinned crept inward lies hid and covered in them till by the light of god which is given to that end they are as by a line or clew led down into themselves and through the laborynth of their own learning and lusts which lies a top of it to find it out again and till by the said light the house be swept and the lost money seen and that swinish nature destroyed and the lost sheep sought out and saved and till the works and image of the serpent who hath in the dark stampt his own likeness on them be again defaced and till the tares which he hath sowed in the night while men slept in the field or inner world of the heart and that earth which hath overgrown the other and brought forth and thornes weeds neetles thistles which is accursed be burnt up and consumed from above that which brings forth herbs meet for the masters use to which the blessing is by the spirit of judgement and of burning in which selfish nature which is that of cain and ishmael and esau the three elder that have no acceptance men will be sacrificing serving and glorying in righteousnesses and of their own devising which all are abomination with god because done in that same nature still in which they are disobedient sinning and serving divers lusts and so by that nature become as well in their very righteousness as in their wickedness children of gods wrath ephes

incurring his displeasure by their

doing of such things as are not only besides but against the law or light of god in the conscience and contrary to that pure primitive nature by which only as men by the light come back to it as many do without the letter the things contained in the holy law can be done and this contradicts that grosly absurd sottish false blind and ignorant assertion of which as a parker related to me he uttered in a discourse with him at sandwich before many people since those three more publick disputes held by and my self with him and his confederates and associates against us who yet are at odds amongst themselves some prclatick some presbyterian some independent viz that it is the corrupt nature by which the nations are said rom to do the things contained in the law which is say the grossest absurdity false doctrine and contradiction to the scripture that can possibly be given for by that corrupt sinning nature by the yet is not ashamed and blushes not to say men do the things in gods law alias keep obey observe conform to gods law which is the pure light shining in the conscience that is spiritual holy just and good that never did nor can consent to the least sin or do other then reprove and condemn it in the heart
say by that corrupt nature which men have by the fall from god who made them upright contracted to themselves which is the very enmity it self against god and all good men do and can do no other then sin against god and do the things that are not contained or commanded in but are contrary to the law and walk in the trespasses and sins in which they lie dead according to the common course and custome of the world while it lies in the wickedness not minding the light according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience and have their conversation in the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind drinking in iniquity as naturally as the beast drinks in water without satisfaction working uncleanness with greediness iohn
and so are by that nature children of wrath but in respect of which said pure primitive nature some gentiles that have not the letter but the light of god and christ within leading them back into it out of that corrupt one by which light they are a law to themselves before god are said to perform by nature what things are required in the law which are as ye say moral duties indeed yet such as saving your ignorance in that are truly righteous and acceptable with god and evangelical being done in christ though they know not his person whilst done in his light for men may do much by the light that comes from the sun while they see not the body of the sun it self and be guided and strengthened to do much by the light of god and christ that is his will and acceptable and good though yet they have not heard of nor known him so much as some that hear and read of such things by the letter as to his appearance in that body of flesh or meer external incarnation witness cornelius whose prayers and almes were heard and accepted being done by one that feared god and eschewed the evil which by the light he had discovered whilst as yet he had not heard of christs personal birth life death or resurrection acts


yea every moral duty that is done in some obedience to the light that is in the conscience and not for base ends and glory of men which ends have

been and are found more among many literarists iews and christians too then among many that by them have been lighted as heathens are evangelical also yea whatever is done from an honest and not selfish principle in the light or law in the heart is of the same nature as that both moral and evangelical law is even spiritual and holy and iust and good and all transgression that is acted against the law is not only against the light of god and christ whose commandment that is and against the gospel or free promise of life held forth also therein but also against nature not that corrupt into which men are run for the sin is committed in that but that divine nature or similitude of god or right reason in which men stood at first til they ran out into a reasonless kind of reason of their own which is not after god a remnant of whose nature is in man still and his light in the conscience which is right reason it leads to and therefore all sinners who are in the deeds of darkness and out of the true faith of christ which is in his light are said to do things contrary to nature though pleasing and answerable to the viperous nature they are gone out into rom

and wicked for all men that have the true light in them have not faith in it

say then the heathen who have not the letter by the light of god which is saving are a law unto themselves and do shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also by the law inlightned bearing witness within them and their thoughts thereby accusing and excusing one another so that the law is not only a light and saving but universal also and common in some measure to all men
to which may be added as an argument ad hominem at least to the stopping of their mouth in proof of the universality of christs enlightning all men another consideration out of and his own book and that is the need that all men that come into the world have of light from christ and the universal necessity of christs enlightning them all because of that universal corruption and blindness which is asserted by them to be in all men at birth


john
where it is said of man coming the world

must be meant say they of humane birth and accordingly this point is thence say they deducible
that every one that comes into the world needs light from christ which position say they is true
because every man is destitute of spiritual light in the things of god concerning his duty and the way of salvation

because every man is liable to death and trouble and wrath and evil from god as he is born into the world and christ came into the world to remove both these sorts of darkness and none else can do it

these are the express words of these two men from which howbeit they most unreasonably conclude against our doctrine saying the former of these overthrows the

main position of the qua
that every man hath a light within him sufficient to guide him so as that following it he may please god and be saved without the light of scriptures or preaching of publick teachers

yet do and may most truly argue and conclude to the fuller establishing of the said position from their own words on this wise
arg
if every man that comes into the world needs light from christ and there be a necessity of christs enlightning in regard that every man is irrecoverably lost else and not some only then christ doth enlighten so far at least as to a possibility for salvation every man and not few men only otherwise god were as is abovesaid a most apparent respecter of mens persons as he is not and his wayes were not equal as they are and his words were not true as they are when he sayes he would have all men to be saved unless they will die and to come to the knowledge of the truth and such like nor were his clearing himself and charging of men that perish right as it is when he sayes their destruction is of themselves but in him is their help nor were his iudgements iust and righteous as they are in condemning men for not believing in the light while they had it when they never had it nor were his pretended great love rich grace matchless mercy to all in christs birth luke
iohn
so sincere as it is but feigned sith else he did not so much as put them all into a possibility of coming out of their but rather left a thousand to one to perish in it unavoidably without remedy nor were his fairest offers of salvation and life to all if they will walkin his light so fair as they are but meer mockage since else he had not given them any measure of any such light as could lead them to it nor were his saying what could have done more for them that have not done any other then a lye as it is not since else he had not done so much as was needful yea so absolutely necessary towards their living that it was not possible they should live without it when he both could should and ought in equity by some measure of true light to have made them capable to come to life and see their way to it
but every man needs light from christ and there is necessity in respect that every man else is blinded by him to his destruction as well as some men of christs enlightning with his true and saving light every man as well as some men only this we need not prove sith and assert it so universally of every man that cometh into the world
therefore undoubtedly more or lesse christ hath with true saving light enlightned every man and not some few men only

chap

shall now betake my self to take some brief view of r.bs and i.ts trivial talk and to consider some of their inconsiderable arguings and confused oppositions to the contrary at least so many as whereby men may judge probably of what sort the rest are who in disproof of the saving sufficiency of the light in every man which they call sometimes the light that comes from god sometimes every mans own light to lead him unto god have mustered up together no less then thirty or forty arguments and reasons as they call them not one of all which hath so much weight in it as can truly render it worthy of the name of a reason in that case its brought for they lie all together in one litter between page
and
making up the whole sixth of those nine dark sermons and no small part of the seventh not more seemingly for then shamefully against the true light there said to enlighten every man that comes into the world prated out from iohn
by tom and back't by baxter
their thirty arguments to which they add ten reasons of their own they say are out of scripture and so confess they are in one sense there being not one at all of them to be found either in or so much as truly deduced from the scripture
the scriptures the first argument is far fetch't from are rom

none understands none seeks after god cor
the natural man discerns not the things of the spirit gen
and
every imagination of mans heart is only evil jer
every man is bruitish in his knowledge jer
the heart is deceitful above all things whence they argue thus their light of whom these things are said is not a safe rule to guide them into the pleasing of god but these things are said of all or some men therefore every mans light in him is not a safe guide to god

rep
we confess these things are said not of some only but of all men as they are in the fall who are all gone out of the way but what of that are all men therefore because gone out without any measure of light sufficient to guide into the way again in that none seeks god are all then without any of that true light wherein god is to be found of such as will seek him in it all natural men such as all are till they turn to be led by the light and spirit by their meer animal wisdome see not spiritual things are all therefore without the least measure of that spirit and spiritual light that shews them viz the law of god in their minds which is spiritual lusting in them against the flesh though they are carnal every mans imagination and thoughts are evil every man is bitish in his own knowledge every mans heart as he is gone out from the truth told by god within himself after the devil that abode not in it is there therefore true light in no man that manifests the deceits of his

heart in some wise to him is that truth in no man which he is to abide in and which if he abide in it it will teach him the will of god say is no measure of this in no men for this argument of these men could it conclude any man to be without the said sufficient light as it does not there being no consequence in it would consequently conclude every man to be without it as he is in the fall and come out into the world and then instead of reading that text viz iohn
that tombs talks from and repeats his sermons on thus that was the true light that enlightens every man that comes into the world as tis in the bible or thus that was the true light that enlighteneth the elect or some few men or some of all sorts as interpret it besides the literal sense and proper import of the term every man we must henceforth read thus· viz
the true light that enlighteneth no man that comes into the world every man being bruitish every mans heart till he comes to the light that's come to him being deceitful as well as any mans and so the saving grace and light shall no more be coop't up in a corner among a few but be allowed no place in the world of any mans heart at all but who will say thus as they say in effect but such as are become bruitish and besotted with them

and if they tell us they speak and mean not of gods light here but of mans own light as no good guide to god what do they band against the for then and bend the force of their frivolous argument against them who look upon every mans own light and thoughts and imagination of his heart wisdome knowledge and understanding which he is gone out into from gods light to be natural and weak and foolishness and darkness as much and more then themselves who are yet found in no other for whatever they mean when they prate against the light the qua testifie to calling it natural mans own and and darkness which andabato um more they confusedly fight against in their dark minds under the terms sometimes of the true light christ bids men believe in that they may be the children of it which is no other then the gospel light of god and christ himself sometimes of every mans own light mans own thoughts imaginations

yet

the qua plead for nothing in man that is meerly of man but for that light alone which is of god and by which what is to be known of god god manifests in man yea in all men the very heathen that have not the scripture which light is that law in the mind which is not evil nor natural but holy just good and spiritual by which alone though these meer humanists and naturalists discern them not the things of the spirit of god are discerned every man in the fall is become bruitish and like the bruit beast of the field lives more by sense then reason is not regulated by right reason in what he does it may as well therefore be concluded that all men have not the least measure of reason in them while they live besides it as these men conclude from mens living besides the light in the deeds of darkness that therefore they have no light in them but an argument it is rather that these pastors are like those ier
who are become bruitish and have not sought the lord

in his light in that they argue so bruitishly not only besides the spiritual light of the lord which would lead them to a right understanding of the truth but also below that common sense and reason that naturally belongs to man for which therefore woe unto them they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall be scattered for which a great commotion is already come out of the north to make their cities their assemblies defolate as a den of dragons

thus far as to r.b and i.ts first argument by which men may judge of the constitution of the rest which are all of the same complexion
the second is drawn from act

rom
the sum of which in short is this the most improved gentiles for all that light which was in them were in all things too superstitious were carried about to dumb idols as they were led had their foolish hearts darkned about their thoughts of god worshipped him ignorantly and such like therefore they much less the most barbarous and consequently none of the gentiles who had not the scripture nor such other teaching as gods people were taught by had not a light in them that was sufficient without the scripture to guide them to god

rep that the gentiles were generally superstitious dark blind idolatrous and ignorant in their worshippings of god deny not howbeit close not cordially with that clause the most improved in the antecedent for twas through of the light they had and because at the best they were ill improved in it that they became so for had they heeded the light they had been led out of idols to the knowledge of god by it for what is to be known of god is by it manifest in them rom
but what if the best improved gentiles were so as ye say vain in their thoughts they might have better improved the light then they did and the reason why they were so fortishly superstitious was not because they had not sufficient light to lead them in the true knowledge of god and his worship and direct them to discern the truth but because they look't not to the light because they went out from the light they had by which they had some measure of the knowledge of god into their own wisdome leaning to their own understanding and so became vain therefore is it said they were without excuse because when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkned and professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of god into an image and changed the truth of god into a lye and worshipped and served the creature more then the creator not liking to retain him and that true worship of him which the light would have led them to in their knowledge and the gentiles there were not so vain and foolish ignorant of god and superstitious for want of light to guide them as dote they were to gods true worship but for want of being guided by the light they had so what's this to their purpose who sees not the blindness weakness folly nakedness and falsity of this argument one absurdity in which also more notable in it then the rest is this viz that in the conclusion is inferred aliud a negaro another thing then that which is denied by the qua and undertaken to be proved against them by themselves for therefore say

they the gentiles who had not the scripture nor such other teaching as gods people are taught by had not a light sufficient the words in which conclusion are true though nihil ad rhombum if there be any such gentiles that have neither scripture nor such other teaching mark that phrase foisted in by them whereby they conclude another matter then is denied by us in the question in hand for the gentiles that have not the other teaching that of the light within have not the light within that's true who doubts it but none such are to be found that have not that light and grace in some measure by which god teaches his and people though most gentiles are found destitute of an outward letter as god teaches his people by which other teaching is that of the light within which is that other yea that chief teaching god teaches his and all people by whether they learn by it yea or nay shall say more to them when see them but at present know none such nor ever have done

before pass to the third argument of from this second shall consider their tenth and thirteenth arguments which are and in effect the same with this second by which three arguments which yet in substance are but one and both are found fencing in their minds together with them against all mens having a sufficient light to guide them into the true saving knowledge of god his worship and the mystery of his kingdome about which have dealt with already in of my first exercitation who all urge peoples ignorance of the things of god his worship and mystery of his gospel and kingdome in proof of their want of a light whereby they might know them which is such an idotish ignorant piece of arguing as he makes who argues a non actu ad non potentiam a non esse ad non posse which is as silly as to conclude that a man sits still therefore he cannot go or he hath no power to walk because when he shuts his eyes and neither will nor does see the sun therefore he never could see it for which a man would be hissed out of the schools by very boyes
as for and they are so enamoured with the eminency and and strength of this their argument the childishness and weakness of which is evident to any save such whose own it is so that being blind at home they will not own the blindness and absurdness of it that they seem to put more stress upon it then on all the rest beside

hereupon it hath more then one or two or three places in their book viz not only in the page forecited but also page
and page
where they conclude that because men stumble and their imaginations are evil their hearts deceitful and wicked therefore they want light to direct them and to rectifie their thoughts if men stumble and fall its an argument say they they want light of such corruption want of light to guide us in the way to happiness oh gross is a chief part ieremies sayings every man is the heart is deceitful do express such a destitution of light truth

from all which it follows that all men have not some saving light as

fully as the bre goes freely the stake are on this wise the mystery of god was hid from the gentiles god hid the things concerning the knowledge of himself from some when he revealed them to others and twas given to some as a special gift quoth words and argument this is above spoken to at large by me to know the mysteries of the kingdome not to others therefore every man hath not a light in him as a sufficient guide to direct him to god

as for his way of argumentation against the sufficiency of this light within to save is in sum the same among his other things or rather nothings to the purpose of which he sayes contrarium they prove the contrary to our assertion of the lights sufficiency to save he names the universal experience of all ages from the beginning of the world to this day· quis enim lucis huius ductu ad ver

for who ever came to the true knowledge of god by the guidance of this light those among all men who have best of all improved it have every man of them become vain in their imaginaons and their foolish heart hath been darkned in all which argumentative matter these four men reason from mens not knowing and being saved by the ne light to their wanting of the true light to know and be saved by when as it follows not at all that becuse they know not and are not saved therefore they are destitute of light but the cause of their perishing in ignorance is not walking in what they have not because they have not sufficient light to walk by or are not put into possibility of to salvation by some measure of that light which is saving their syllogiring is as silly in this as to say of a man that voluntarily himself he does not see therefore he cannot that man stumbles and falls therefore he cannot do otherwise when yet he may but that he his own eyes or gives way to others to do it from seeing his way as most men do to the god of this world lest the light of the gospel which they have because it reproves them should shine out in them and as a potentia ad actum so a non actu ad non est confequentia men can no more wisely nor infer from mens not knowing of god truly a or insufficiency in that light they have if they seek him in it to reveal him and make him truly known then from the being of a power to a necessity of the act which is a non sequitur with a witness we know that most men know not the mysteries of the ingdome but tis not because they may not or for of light but because they will not come to the light by which they may and therefore when as the question is aske the light which is in some measure in the of all men be sufficient to make kno
god savingly why do not all come to be saved by the knowledge of him whom to know is life eternal because they give not up to be guided by it and come not to it when its to them in order to their salvation for god sent it the world would though the world is condemned by it through their not coming to it but that the world through it might be saved for the light which judges the sin is saving to the soul and by it that one law giver who is able both to save and destroy doth both judge and destroy the works of the devil in men for

which end he is manifested in the world and men as they will not be weaned nor saved from those works and saves also from those destructive works all such souls as give up to be guided by it

and to the true knowledge of god by the guidance of this light answer all that ever did come to the true knowledge of god at all and those as little as these men know them are not a few though few in comparison of those that are ignorant who by walking in li~ght while they had it have come to experience that life of god which is yet hid from you wise and prudent ones and ever will be and more as ye are alienated from this light within yourselves much more while are such vnter banders of your selves against both it and the children of it
and whereas thou sayest
they who have best of all improved it are become vain thou utterest thou know'st not what for rom
which thou proof thereof doth no less service to the truth then to disprove that thy false assertion for all who look not beside the light may see it speaks not at all of as well improve it but of such as improved it not all but when they knew god by it who ver
by it manifested in them was in of himself glorified him not as god nor were thankful answerably to retain him in their knowledge but ran from his into their own thoughts and so into the things which they knew the iudgements of god and death were due unto the doers of
and as for the mysteries of the gospel tis true they are hid from the most and tis given to some to know them not to others bat look ye blind that ye may see how came they to be hid from some why was it given to some and not to others to know them and who were those others that knew them not were they such as could never see them meerly for want of light to shew them doth the text of your own alledging viz matth

in proof of that your sigment say so doth i~t not plainly say as we say against you that it was because first there was a time wherein they might have seem them but would not had ears to hear but stopt them eyes to see but closed them they seeing not hearing heard not would understand nor perceive nor be converted nor healed when god would have converted and healed them and such like so boc omne ad delirium what's all this to dreams of our doctors who from thence and such like places as overthrow themselves divine out arguments against all mens having sufficient light speaking evil of the light and iudging the light as imperfect which is the law of god which is perfect in each measure of it of which they will not be but iudges for which judging and evill speaking of what they know not while in what they know naturally and but psuchicos animally as bruit in those very things corrupt themselves woe is to them from the lord all such iudges and their iudgement must come to iudgement

moreover might we lawfully so argue but first we need not there being enough besides to urge in thereof and secondly we do not there being little force in such arguments against the sufficiency

of the letter to save as they think they may against the sufficiency of the light need we do any more then turn the edge of their own weapon against themselves in that particular who not only call the letter a saving light but also argue for it as such with a non obstante to the small number of such as are actually saved by it even among those that both have it and often read it for say they in way of plea for the dead letters being a saving light where ere it comes no matter how few come to salvation by it because they refuse to walk by it its never the less saving and sufficient though men that have it perish because its come to them and is able on its own part to give life but that on their parts its not made use of not obeyed its no argument its notable to save that most men where it is are not actually saved but rather perish the say of the light which they are so foolish as to argue so fillily against
a non non prsse non est arguendum there's no arguing from its not being actually so or so to the of the thing to be we cannot conclude that there's a in that to save all men by which all men actually are not saved for then not only the letter which only kills yet they plead this way is saving and brings to life but even god and christ himself as well as their light in mens consciences who call to all ends of the earth to look to than for salvation in it isa
must absit blasphemia be judged also as insufficient to save by whom though supremely all are saved that are saved at all yet all men actually are not saved

suppose then there were fewer that come to life by the light then do as there be none at all that ever came to it by the letter even of those scribes that therein look for the eternal life iohn
yet will is not follow as they judge it will that the light within all is not sufficient to lead to life or if it will and these men will needs have it so then let them take what comes along with that their own consequence to themselves for it payes them home in another kind whil'st twill much rather conclude against the letters being a saving light which against us and the truth they eagerly argue so to be fith by their own confession not one of many that have it come to life or salvation by it
and whereas they say the defect and default of this is not therefore because the scripture is not a saving light but because they walk not in it the say we of the light within which the letter came from in which there's no defect which as paul sayes of it for its the law of life rom
is weak to save no otherwise but because it is not answered else life should come by it so that their own pen is their own paymaster still which ever and anon pulls down at one time what it builds up at another and contradicts thwarts and razes out as false in one place the same that it writes for truth in another yea en ecce behold the confusions of these men a non actu ad non potentiam from the of the effect i.e the life to the of the light to lead to it such as of it is no lawful argument say they when they plead against us the sufficiency of the letter to save yet from all mens not being ac~tùal'y and effectually saved by it we may strongly conclude there is not efficacy nor sufficiency in the light within al nan to

save all men in whom it is how strictly soever they attend to it say they when we plead against the sufficiency of the light to save it being therefore but meet that out of their own measure where with they me~asure to us it should be meeted to them again
shall conclude my answer to al these four men and to all men else whose it is as to this their argument a non esse ad non posse against the lights sufficiency in the very words mutatis mutandis interpositis interponendis additis addendis wherein themselves only speak either by way of concession against themselves of this truth we plead against them or by way of answer to such as they suppose to use the same though do not for he is no wise man that uses it at all against the sufficiency of their dead letter


those of r.b are as follows who in
of his epistle to the reader prefixed to his book sayes thus of the qua
do they hold that common supernatural light outward and inward objective and inherent is given to many at least of the unsanctified that live under the preaching of the gospel who contradicteth them in this answ
those who deny any but meet natural any supernatural saving or spiritual light to be given in common to all or to any but the sanctified ones the saints and the elect as yourselves do saying as nihilnon naturale nihil spirituale nihil a christo mediatore lumen salutare nulta sub consideratioue
christ doth not in any wise vouchsafe supernatural spritual saving light to any but the elect he is blind that once dreams the contrary and such like as are to be found up and down his book ex

r.b do they hold that as the sun is appointed in nature to be the light of every man that cometh into the world though some parts of the earth were never illuminated by it and blind men partake not of its light and the night and shutting our eyes and windows may exclude it so christ is by office the sun in the world of grace giving men actually all the gracious light they have and being sufficient in himself to enlighten all and giving them an illuminating word which is sufficient in its own kind to do its own part though many are blind and many for their sin are deprived of the communication of this light why all this we maintain as well as they
answ
the more shame for you to stand up against that ye maintain yourselves when the same is maintained by us as ye do when ye argue from some mens not seeing because they shut their eyes therefore they have not light by which sufficiently to see their way to life as for your simile from the suns not enlightning all parts of the world outwardly from which its like ye conceive christ the sun of righteousness hath not inwardly enlightned all men it is but a quibble for as there is nothing hid from the heat thereof nor from some participation of the natural light and heat of the sun at least neither by night nor day though some times places and seasons are darker then some semblably no hearts from some measure of the light of christ psal

compared with rom
r.b do they say all this light within us and without us is to be hearkened to and obeyed why what man did they ever speak with that is a christian that denieth it

answ
none but such as yourselves who for all your prate here and elsewhere saying
in way of warning to men that they act not against this light within that certainly it concerns every man so far to look to the light within him that he do not as it is said of some iob rebel against the light and
that no light which is truly such is to be rejected yet elsewhere yea in the pages how ur safe it is to obey the light within it leading and guiding men well in somethings in most into crooked and dangerous unwarrantable and sinfulwayes as some in the beastly blasphemous blindness of your benighted hearts imputing mens murders and pauls persecutions of the saints to their following thereof which things only arose from their following their own thoughts and forsaking and leaving the light of god within which lead to better even ever to good only and never at all into any evil as also after his strict challenges of obedience from every man to the light in his own conscience as to that which infallibly speaks to him from god himself page
of his english treatises in his blind hasty hatred against them whom he mainly encounters in his latine cryes out against this same verbum spiritum lumen internion which the qua call all men into the obedience of in mockage as figmentum horrendum crasse excogitatum infallibilem quid quod lumen quem deum christum imaginarium to panz nihil rejiciendum detessandum some horrible sigment of the qua
imaginary christ infallible doetor know not what god some spiritual everything just nothing but meer darkness it self to be rejected and detested

and as for os words concerning the sufficiency of the letter shall use them in answer to himself and yourselves as concerning the sufficiency of the light on its own part to save though few are saved by it only where he sets that term scripture and word of god by which all along he means the outward scripture shall place the term light within by which intend that inward word that is nigh in mens hearts adding and interposing in a different character what clauses are not his or distinctions sake and so carry on this my general answer to that their foresaid general argument to an end

doth it in the least impair this sufficiency of the light within to lead to life that its a moral and spiritual not a natural light because all men come not to life by it it suffices that there is nothing wanting on its own part for the discovery and revelation of the way to life
to argue that the sun is not the sun or the great means of communicating external light into the world because blind men cannot see it nor will believe so much of it as they are told will scarce be admitted nor doth it in the least impeach the efficacy and sufficiency of the light pleaded for that men stupidly blind cannot comprehend it iohn
do not assert that where ever the light within scripture quoth is brought by what means soever whether in a ministry of it without calling men to turn to it or a measure of it within calling men to turn to god all to whom its preached and to whom it preacheth must instantly of necessity assent unto it and come to the saving knowledge of god by it many men who are not yet stark blind may have so abused their eyes that where light is brought into a dark place

they may not be able to discern it men may be so propossest with innumerable prejudices principles received by strong traditions corrupt affections making them bate the light as woful experience shews that and many others do that they may not behold the glory of the light within word quoth i.e with him the letter with me the light when it is brought unto them as it is nigh in the heart that they may do it but its nothing to our present whether any man living in sin do discern this light whilst the defect may be justly cast on their own blindness cor
by the manifestation of the truth we commend our selves to every ones conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are losts in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them there is in the dispensation of the light within word quoth meaning the letter an evidence of truth commending itself to the consciences of men some receive not this evidence is it for want of light in the truth or light itself no that is a glorious light that shines as the bare letter doth not for it was never there in the hearts of men is it for want of testimony to assert this light no for many daily testifie it but meerly because the god of this world hath blinded the eyes of men that they should not behold it where ever the light within word quoth meaning the letter comes by what means soever it hath in it self a sufficiency of light to evidence to all and will do it eventually to all that are not blinded by the god of this world the knowledge of god its author and the true way of salvation and the only reason why all are not saved is because all do not receive its witness and the reason why it is not received by mary in the world to whom it is come and in whom it is is the advantage that satan hath to keep them in ignorance and blindness by the lusts corruptions prejudices and hardness of their own hearts the light within word quoth meaning still the letter makes a sufficient proposition of itself and is sufficient to save where ever it is and he to whom it shall come as it is to all in their hearts who refuses it as darkness errour delusion euthusiasone fanaticisme because it is testified against as so and worse by and his followers who calls it nihil and in a mockage an imagined christ whether it be himself in whom satan testifies all this against it or any other that refuse it upon os false testimony against it from satan in him will give an account of his atheisme and infidelity he that hath the witness of god which is the light within for the letter without is but mans witness for god as moved by his spirit to declare outwardly what he inwardly knows of him need not stay for the witness of man which is the letter without which letter yet doth abundantly testifie to the light as greater then itself wheresoever the light within word quoth meaning the letter still is received indeed as it requireth itself to be received and is really assented the word of god sufficient to save it is so received upon the evidence of that light and sufficiency which it is found and felt by such as walkin it to have and hath in itself to such manifestly declaring it self so to be its all one by what means by what hand whether of a child or babe of stammering lips or of a church of god for both those wayes its witnest to without the

intimation and knowledge of the light within us comes to us from god and towards us by being the word of god it hath its power of manifesting to us the way to life and of manifesting it self so to be from its own innate light now this light in the scripture which the scripture which is not it declares to be in the heart for the sufficiency of which to lead to life without the scripture as it did before that was we contend hath an impress far more then the letter hath of gods excellency upon it distinguishing it by infallible tekmeria from the product of any creature or of the meer principles of nature as dreams for though it was in men from the creation yet it is not his natural faculty of understanding or the mind or the conscience as he and his fellows foolishly fancy ex

but some thing that is of god and from him which is a witness to him in the conscience and in the mind it is that spirit in man and inspiration of the almighty which giveth him understanding iob
that he may know him iohn
though all that have it do not know him by it for from may to must there is no arguing by this god dives into the consciences of men into all the secret recesses of their hearts into a which such a gross thing as a meer outward manuscript cannot get guides teaches directs determines and judges in them upon them in the name majesty and authority of god if the men who are blinded by the god of this world will yet deny this light and not come to it that they may be saved by it because they perceive it not to be sufficient to save them it shall not prejudice them nor hinder their salvation who do by this sufficiency say doth the light within scripture quoth make such a proposition of itself as the light and power word quoth meaning the letter
of god that who ever rejects it doth it at the peril of his eternal ruine and thereby a bottom and foundation is tendred for that faith which it requireth to repose it self upon

for the proof then of the sufficiency of the light within divine authority of the scripture quoth to lead to life unto him or them who as yet on no account whatever do acknowledge it shall only suppose that by the providence of god he or they be brought to the light book quoth so as that he or they be ingaged to the consideration of it or do attend to the leadings of it upon a supposal hereof leave them and the light word quoth together and if it evidence not its own sufficiency unto their consciences it is because they are blinded by the god of this world which will be no plea for the refusal of it at the last day and they who receive it not on this ground
all never receive it on any as they ought the light within scripture quoth is enrolled among things of that nature as do manifest their own it is absolutely called the power of god and that unto its proper end i.e salvation which way lyes the tendency of its efficacy in operation rom
the word concerning the cross that is the gospel or the light for the light is the cross to the carnal mind will and wisdome is the power of god cor
and faith which is built on that light word quoth not the letter without other helps or advantages is said to stand in the power of god
cor
this and not the naked letter is the rod of his power or strength psa
giving all manner of assurance and full perswasion of its own authority efficacy and sufficiency

by vertue of this power it hath ever brought forth fruit among such as came to it in all the world in which it is and into which it is come without sword without for the most part miracles without humane wisdom or oratory without any inducements or motives but what were meerly and solely taken from it self consisting in things that hath not seen nor ear heard nor could enter into the heart of man to conceive hath it doth it and will it much more now then ever exert this its power and efficacy to the conquest of the world causing men of all sorts in all times and places where its ministry comes so to fall down before its divine authority as immediately to renounce all that was dear to them in this world and to undergo whatever as dreadful terrible and destructive to nature in all its dearest concernments it is now the work of many to insist on the particulars where in this power exerts it self yea it sel doth more and more manifest its own sufficiency to condemn and save so that need not inlarge upon them the workings thereof are spiritual such as have their seat dwelling and abode in the hearts and consciences of men whereby they are not liable to any exception as though they were pretended men cannot hard in themselves in the rejection of the testimony the light gives by sending for magicians to do the like or by any pretence that it is a common thing that is fallen them on whom the light word quoth meaning the scripture puts forth its power as it will do when the book of conscience begins to open the seat and residence of its effects is against all power and authority but that of god its diving into the hearts and consciences and secret recesses of the minds of men its judging and sentencing of them in themselves its convictions terrours conquest and killing of men its converting building up making wise holy obedient its administriag consolations in every condition to which consolation belongs and the like effects of its power and sufficiency are usual'y spoken of and appropriated to the letter by such as are ignorant of the light who speak what they read and hear of more then feel as death and destruction that hear the same of that which is hid from them
but are effectually felt and experimentally known by the children of the light who love and live in it

these are the foundations of my answer to os ds bs and ts grand argument above mentioned against the sufficiency of the light to guide men into the true knowledge and life of god drawn from the non efficiency of that its end in all men the light say we the law of god which is the light in all is not only testified to as saving by the letter and as powerful and sufficient in all those fore named respects in which sayes the letter it self is which the letter faith not of it self for all that faith in the thirteen last sections of the fourth cha of his first tr in whose own words have mostly spoken by way of answer to himself is most true if applyed to the word of god indeed which is nigh in the heart and of the light of law of god in the conscience but every of it false as applyed by him to a wrong subject viz the outward scripture or bare letter and as the letter bears testimony to the light so the light bears testimony enough to it self of its own sufficiency in the conscience that testimony is the witness of god himself which who so doth not accept and believe he doth what in him lies to make

god a lym to give us an infallible assurance that in receiving this testimony we are not imposed upon by cunningly devised fables the light the scriptures quoth or law in the heart hath that glory of light and power of god accompanying of it as wholly distinguisheth it by infallible signs and evidences from all words and writings nor divine conveying its truth and power into the souls and consciences of men with such an infallible certainty that it is believed though men act contrary to it for when that within tells men what they should not do viz not lye steal murder cozen nor do evil to others that they would not have others do to them though they do these evils yet they cannot but believe through that light in them if they had never seen the letter that they should not do so and that the judgements of god are due to such as do so and when by that they are told what they are they by it believe truly what they are and cannot while they behold themselves in that glass believe themselves to be otherwise or better then they are no more then a mans natural face that is beheld in a true outward glass can seem to him or be believed by him to be fairer then it is

thus having at large answered the main argument of these four men against the universality of a sufficient light in all men to lead to life such as follow it drawn from all mens nor actually coming to life by it which one and aiming at number more then weight make three of their thirty viz the second tenth and thirteenth
shall run thorough the residue more briefly they being not worth any long insistance on them
their third and fourth which are but one and the same also divided needlesly into two they ground upon such texts as directly prove the contrary against them viz iohn
eph
matth

where its said the light shines in darkness and the darkness comprehends it not the true light was in the world and the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not ye were sometimes darkness
to them that fate in darkness light is sprung up
whence they argue on this wise many of the iews and gentiles sate in darkness did nor reciive the light nor comprehend it and were darkness when the true light came to and shined in them therefore they had no light in them much less every man
rep whence argue in proof of the very contrary thus the true light came to such as received at not to such as knew it not springs up as they heed it to such as sate in death and darkness and shineth in the darkness joh
though the darness comprehendeth it not but all men as well as some at some time or other are found not receiving the light not knowing it sitting in darkness and are darkness therefore all men have in some measure the true light shining in them besides if this would prove that the true light is not present with all men because most neither know nor receive it but abide dwell sit still in darkness and remain darkness it self then at least it will conclude against these men another way viz in disproof of the outward letters being the true light as they contend it is since the iews and most christians so call'd both do and ever did dwell in darkness and continue darkness notwithstanding the scriptures abode among them

their fifth is as a very fiddlestick as any of the former and all that follow it are no better fetch'd from luke
in such wise as more clearly concludes that and as wise disputers of this world as they seem to be in suo genere in their generation are yet but fools as to the true faith and children of this world and darkness then that all men have not some true light in them and it runs thus if every man had a light within him sufficient to guide him how to please god then every man should be a child of light but every man is not a child of light therefore every man hath not a light to guide him to god

the major of which is such a palpable inconsequence as the least child of light and of the day cannot but both discern and be ashamed of for however in proof of it tis asserted by them that to be a child of light is all one as to be a person that hath light in him to guide him to please god yet if they would but consult with that light of god which is yet in themselves if they have not by fighting against it cast themselves forth into the outer darkness and not meerly with their own dark animal they could not chuse but see that as have shewed above the light is in them that are not in it nor as yet believing in it and that they that believe in it are the children of it according to what christ sayes iohn to such as had light and yet neither walked in nor were children of it while ye have the light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light
their sixth in proof of which is cited act

where paul saith christ sent him to the gentiles to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light from the power of satan to god is so silly that it shews its authors and owners shrewdly to be besorted whence they argue they who are to be turned from darkness to light had not a light within sufficient to guide them to god but so it is said of both jews and gentiles therefore sure they had not such a light within them as the qua say is in all if they had such a light they should have been directed to follow it not turned from it the apostles should have call'd them as the qua do to follow the light in them and not have call'd them out of darkness nor should we do as the apostles did men leave the darkness in them but as the qua do follow the light in them
rep flocci nauci nihili pili assis hujus teruncii

did ever the like toying and trisling piece of dispotation drop from the hands of men before as does here from the pens of these professed disputers where are the eyes of these men that they can't see or is it so that they will not see how they turn that very text upside down they would seem to take their tattle out of was it not the business of the apostles to direct men to follow the light when they were sent to turn men to the light were they that were to be turned to the light in that very call they had from the apostles to turn to it turned from it do not they who call men out of the darkness which is in them even in that very thing call them to follow the light which shines in them also pet must not they who leave the darkness of necessity look to the light can men leave the paths of uprightness and not walk in the wayes of darkness prov
or leave the wayes of darkness and not walk in the way of the light

is there any medium between these two are men to be bid to come from the power of satan unto god and yet have they no light safe and sufficient lent them in case they be willing to come to him to lead and guide them unto god ye blind guides did not paul as he was sent to that end as that text declares turn men from the darkness only did he not turn men to the light did he turn them from it as in that clause should have been directed to follow the light and not turned from it ye intimate he did and did not iohn whose message and ministry was the as peter's and paul's and that of all holy men of god was even from the beginning iohn
as well that of christ himself iohn
declare to men that in order to fellowship with god is whom is no darkness at all they should not only cease to walk in darkness but also should walk in the light as god is in the light are ye not in this as well as in many more matters justly given over and left of the lord for your enmity to his light to babble out such gross blindness and groapable darkness as ye here do in saying that if men had such light they should have been directed to follow it and not turned from it according to act

as if paul were there said to be sent that by his ministry men might be turned from the light who is there expresly said to be sent to turn men to it for shame utter no more such wretched ignorance as this left the shame of your nakedness appear at last to all men as it does already to such as read your sapless sermons and have not fold themselves to see rather with your eyes then with their own

their seventh is on this wise wrested from rom
heb
where its said without faith it is impossible to please god and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how bear without a preacher so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god which say they were vain speeches if there were another ordinary way by the light within us to beget faith therefore the light within us is not of it self without preaching a safe sufficient guide in our way to god

rep true faith is in the light of christ and in the word of god which is that word of faith which the apostles preached and testified of in their words and writings that it was nigh to men even in their hearts that there they might both hear and do it rom
neither doth any man either hear or believe in christ to salvation any further then as he heeds hears and believes in that light and ingrafted word whereby christ counsels him in his own conscience although he should as the unbelieving iews did hear him speaking to them with audible voice or believe as all unbelieving christians do the whole history of him according to the flesh so then faith unto life coming by hearing and hearing unto life being of that light and word of god which is nigh in the heart which is the word of both faith and life the apostles speeches were in vain if there were not such a light and word within to be believed in to the hearing and believing in which the apostles were sent to turn men mens obeying of which word within was the end of their using those words they spake and wrote to them in from without
moreover we deny not preaching without by such as are sent as paul was but are not to turn men to the light within but the light within only is that which

guides and leads those that are turned to it and continue attending to it sufficiently and safely unto god

their eighth is to this purpose all that have access to god must not be conformed to this world but be transformed renewed put off the old man rom
eph
col
therefore they have not a light within them as a safe sufficient guide to lead them to god antecedent to this renewing for if they had what need say they such transforming renewing to the world putting off the old man
rep
therefore they need such renewing transforming putting off the old man to this world because that is the good will of god concerning them and also millions of men who have the light in them that condemns and reproves them for their rebellion against it are not conformable thereunto and therefore they both have and need such a light within them antecedent to that renewing and need also to be called upon to turn unto it that they may thereby see how conformable they are to this evil world and to that will of god that they may thereby first know the good will of god which is manifested in that light and secondly by obeying that light be conformed to that will and no more unto the world but transformed by the renewing of their minds so that whereas they conclude all men ought to be renewed after gods image therefore all have it not contrariwise conclude all ought to be renewed according thereunto therefore all have a light sufficient to lead them as théy follow it into the image of god
their ninth is a sottish shameful tergiversation a re substrats from the question into another matter as clear contrary to the subject in hand as light and darkness are to each other yea instead of persevering to prosecute the proof of their proposition concerning the of the light in all men they fall a proving the insufficiency of the darkness in all men to be a sufficient rule to life and safe guide of men unto god at the end of which they entail a most abominable lye against the quakers saying the qua prescribe that unto men as their rule which god counts their curse and what's that scilicet the thing that of all things the quak of all men who call men to gods light within do call men out of viz the counsels imaginations and lusts of their own hearts which men say the qua walking in and the light of god and hearkening to and not to the voice of god which confesses page
though in his folly he calls it natural to be gods light in every conscience come under the laws curse and make their own misery great upon them the is briefly thus to leave a person to own imagination lust to walk in his own counsel in his own way which is all one as to leave him to the light within him is reckoned as the greatest curse and iudgement to a man from god for refusing to hearken to gods voice as the text shews psa
therefore the light within each person is of it self no safe guide

rep that the qua call to the light within and to stand in the councel of god which is the light within which condemns all the lusts of mens hearts and their own vain counsels and imaginations is most true but if ye be not past shame be ye ashamed and blush both at your own blaspheming

the light of god and belying of the qua who in your blindness for which wo is unto you except ye repent isa
cal good evil and light darkness and cannot see to put a difference between gods light and mans lust the councel law and way of god in every conscience which leads to life blessing and peace and the vain wayes and thoughts of man and law of sin that lusts to envy and all evil and leads to cursing and condemnation and secondly cannot understand the qua any otherwise then as calling men to their own hearts lusts when they expresly and in terminis ca'l ad men to that light of god in them which makes manifest and condemns every ones own lust in every heart generation of vipers where did ye ever hear or hear of any qua or any one that's owned by them in their ministry prescribe mans own counsel imagination or hearts lust to him as their rule do they not as iohn baptist did bear witness to that true light which enlightae~th every man that cometh into the world do they not as christ did call men to walk and believe in the light while they have it that they may be the children of it least utter darness come as tis already on your selves so that ye know not whether ye go upon them do they not with paul whom ye wot to have received some message to turn men from it speak to men to turn from the darkness to the light from the power of satan the ruler of the darkness of this world unto god do they not tell men with peter that there's a sure word of prophesie for them to which they do well to take heed as to a light that shines in the dark place of their hearts till the day dawn and the arise there do they not with iohn tell men that god is light and in the light and that in him is no darkness at all and that if men be their form never so fair say they have fellowship with god and walk in darkness and the lusts of the flesh as papists pralaticks presbyterians independents and other professors do they do but lye and do not the truth but if they walk in the light as god is in it then god and they have fellowship together and there the blood of his son is felt clearsing from all sin which ye say men cannot be thoroughly cleansed from while they live here and so harden men in their own hearts lusts and is all this of the qua a prescribing to men their hearts lusts as their rule do you understand christ paul peter iohn and all the prophets calling to the light isa

as isaiah come ye let us walk in the light of the lord he will teach of his wayes we will walk in his paths so as ye do us when we restifie the same truth often in their own words as calling men to follow their own wayes thoughts counsels imaginations hearts lusts if ye take us as intending so when we call to the light why not them if not them why us who say the same is the word light more offensive more unsavoury more difficult to be understood more savouring of lust more sounding like lust out of our mouths whom ye superlatively abhor then out of theirs whom ye now superstitiously adore but so it alwayes fell out as i.o truly sayes page
that scarce any prophet that spake in the name of god had any approbation from the church in whose dayes he spake people being so eminently perplexed with false prophets in the latter dayes of the iewish church especially both as to their number and subtilty speaking lyes against the truth therefore no marvel it is so now in these last dayes of the church of the outside christians and as the next age to that which

flew them began still to build sepulchres in remembrance of them so the time is neer to come wherein ye or your successors who cast out the name of gods people called qua as evil now shall what ere ye dream be forced to say there's a seed among them which sincerely serves the lord which shall be counted to him for a generation and to confess as much as they are now a curse among men that they are the seed whom god hath blessed

virtutem incolumem odimus sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi

their eleventh argument from jude
having not the spirit john
the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive is this every man hath not the spirit of god therefore every man hath not a light within sufficient to guide him to god
rep every man that hath not so long resisted grieved quenched the motions of the spirit of god striving in him that it thereupon is taken from him as it was from those sensual ones iude speaks of whom god had given over to their lusts hath the spirit striving within him and that's enough to our purpose who own such a state that some may be given over to for not using what they had while they had it as wherein to have wisdome at whose reproof they would not turn withdraw and leave them to the way of folly and the good spirit depart from them as he did from saul iudas the iews and others and leave the house even their hearts wholly desolate and destitute of his presence for the evil spirit that lusteth in men to envy to enter and totally to possess them and the talent or measure of gods light within sith they would not trade with it taken away from them that the darkness might come upon them and the grace of god that brought salvation to them which at some time or other appears to all men tit
sith they would not learn of it to to deny ungodliness but turned it into wantonness and received it in vain despising the riches of it when it would have led them to repentance leave them to the impenitency and hardness of their hearts that they might fill up their measure of sin and so wrath come upon them to the utmost but all this proves not but that once they had it or else christ would not have said to such as yet walk't not in it walk in the light while ye have it least darkness come upon you and ye know not whither ye go nor could your selves say rationally as ye do to wicked men often people now while his good spirit moves in your spirits resist not quench not his motions left like them that lay at the pool of bethesda not stepping in while the angel moved on the waters you be left unhealed forever work whilst its day left the night come on you wherein none can work his spirit will not strive alwayes

as for the worlds not receiving the spirit so as to walk in it it proves not that god gives it not any more then that they have no grace given them of god because they receive it in vain and ye may as well say unreasonable men have no principle of reason left in them because they live not by it as that they have not a sufficient light in them to lead them because they do not walk in it besides it is expressly said of christ that by

the same spirit by which himself was quickned he went and preached to the spirits in prison to their own lusts which were disobedient in the old world in the dayes of noah which was not by his ministry without only as the dream but within also in their own hearts

their twelfth runs thus the son did not reveal the father to every man nor did every man come to christ therefore every man had not a light within him sufficient to guide him to god
rep
the consequence of this is utterly false for though the world hates christ the light and comes not to him yet he is come a light into the world this he that's not willingly ignorant of it can scarcely chuse but see if he read iohn
it follows not because men come not into christs light that therefore it is not come into them it being as is shewed above one thing for the light to be in men another for them to be in it
am come that they might have life faith christ of the jews john
yet ye search the scriptures and therein look for eternal life but will not come to me that ye may have life faith he to the scribes iohn
both these comings of each to other are necessary to the life else though the light that is able to lead to it be in men they not being led by it cannot have it
moreover christ does by his light reveal the father to such as hate both him and his father though they like not to know him thereby else he could not say truly as he does to such iob
if had not come and spoken to them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin if had not done in them the works which none other doth they had not had sin but now they have both seen and hated both me and my father in what measure men see the mind and will of christ and his father manifested in them by the light within rom
and hate that they see and hate both christ and his father whose light and mind and will that is which appears to them
their fourteenth is urged by them from texts of scripture every of which most clearly prove or rather positively asserts the very thing they contend against viz that christ is come a light to them that sit in darkness and so all men do a light to the nations a light into the world that whosoever that is in the world he is come into believeth in him should not perish nor walk nor abide in darkness but have the light of life iohn

for not coming to which nor believing in which not loving but hating of which not living by which only the world comes to be condemned were ever men so blinded but say they christs coming a light into the world would be needless if every man had a light in him before christs coming into the world sufficient to guide him in the way to god therefore the quakers opinion about the light in each person is a manifest errour
rep
your apprehension of the qua
opinion is either a manifest errour or a wilful piece of ignorance or a miserable mistake or something for they hold no such thing as a light in each man sufficient to guide him without or besides that of christ or before christs coming into the world but that the whole world lying in wickedness and sitting in darkness christ is sent a light to enlighten them who without him are lost and that he who is that true light doth more or less by his coming into the world enlighten every man that comes into it

the fifteenth concludes a lye against the qua as denying the use of and dehorting from searching the scriptures which while christ iohn
bids search and paul tim

sayes are useful and profitable the qua say no say they but look to the light within you

rep say though the qua say look to the light within as christ and paul did yet they no more deny the usefulness of the scripture then either of those scriptures ye quote proves that absolute necessity of the scripture as to salvation which ye seem to plead though christ and paul never did so nor do we any more dehort from searching the scripture then christ iohn
exhorteth to search them which is not at all in that text for howbeit ereunate search may be rendred either indicatively or imperatively as to its own signification as elsewhere shew its most evident that he speaks there by way of complaint of the scribes for looking for life in the scriptures without coming to him who is the light ver
and not by way of command to search them ye search not search ye
their sixteenth is from isa
psa
to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word there is no light in them thy word is a light to my feet a lamp to my path whence they sillily argue or rather blindly assert the qua
opinion and speech concerning a sufficient light in all men to be contrary to the law and testimony and gods word ordinances ministry and many other things and therefore erroneous and without light in it
rep
the antecedent here is most false for the law testimony and word there spoken of which is a lamp and light to the feet and path and according which who speaks not it is because the morning is not yet to him for the word is undefined span alphabet through the mistranslation of which phrase thus there's no light in him many not knowing the hebrew and many that know it not heeding it make no small ado against the lights being in all men as vavasor powell did once at eltham is no other then that light within even that word which david had and hid within him that he might not sin against god by which young men taking heed thereunto may come to cleanse their way psa
that word of faith that is nigh in the heart which the apostles preached or witnessed to rom
that law and commandment which is said to be a lamp and light prov
that inward testimony of iesus or spirit of prophesie which we with all the prophees of old by words and scriptures bear our outward testimony unto call'd by peter pet

the more sure word of prophesie to which men do well to give heed as unto a light shining in the dark place of their heart till the day dawn and the day star arise therein

this say and not the external text as ye all triflingly talk is that law and testimony and word there spoken of even the law and testimony that comes and is written and is given and received immediately from and out of god and christ's own light voice and mouth in the hearts minds and consciences of all people which his own people only give ear and hearken to even the rod the spirit the word and sword of his mouth which priests and all people are summoned to seek to to stand in as gods own counsel and to take counsel at and be cover'd with and take heed to their way by that they may not sin against the lord and which all the wicked

that sin against must once be slain by psa

rev which the priests above all others usually depart from and forget and are partial in and cause people in stumble at and forget who therefore neither profit people nor thrive in any thing but ignorance and deceit themselves because they stand not in it from whom though their schools are call'd nurseries of learning of true religion and divinity there goes forth no true divination but sottishness and profaneness into all lands

this is that law and living word and true testimony even the light and word of god in the heart a testimony that's said to be bound up from the outward israel which may have the outward bible bound among them a law that's said to be sealed up among christs disciples from the sight of the seers which such as seek to seek to the lord himself and such as forsake go from the fountain of the living water to broken cisteers and such as leave for an outward letter leave the living for the dead and seek for the living lord among the dead these are the wells of salvation out of which souls should draw the living water which the philistines in envy to the seed of abraham will strive alway to slop till the lord make room for them to flow out to the full
these are that word law and testimony and not the most original copies of the letter as i.o and ye all with him do emptily imagine page
which who so deprives of the hebrew punctation by proving the novelty thereof do with abimelechs servants no less then utterly stop the wells or fountains from whence ye should draw all your souls refreshment
these as have shewed so abundantly above at the end of my third exercitation in answer to i.o that shall need say no more here in proof thereof are the matters meant by the said law and testimony isa
which are not contrary to the writing without neither and the true outward ministry and ordinances but consonant thereunto which inward law word and testimony your selves being contrary to and opposing are therein contrary to gods word and the outward scripture of it also therefore not the qua who own all these but your own opinion is erroneous and your speech is without light
the seventeenth from eph
runs thus the opinion and practise of the qua makes every man a teacher and teachers set by god for the work of the ministry needless as if were no gift but a burden to the church cryes them down therefore its contrary to gods and christs way and so antichristian

rep
the antecedent here is a false tale and a meer slander of the qua for neither do they so much as doctrinally make every man a teacher for they deny both your selves and all that side with you to be men fit to be teachers of others unless ye were better taught your selves or had learn't the truth of god much better then as yet ye have done and howbeit they know your ministry who are set by men to minister for money to be not only needless but also useless fruitless unprofitable burdensome chargeable and more destructive then saving both to peoples souls and to the nations yet we own all teachers set by god for the work of the

ministry which are such only as are made ministers by gifts of god from above and not such as buy their gifts at university that they may fell them again to be both needful useful and profitable both to the turning people of the world to the light word within that thereby they may be begotten into christs nature and also to the edifying of the saints in their faith in that light till they come up into the measure of the fulness of christs stature a state which ye deny to be so much as attainable in this life so far are ye from building any up into it neither as much as we are call'd to cry out against you as all the true prophets ever did against the hireling priests do we at all cry down such gifts or gifted men as god gives to his church but wot you well that your selves are the men who are found fighters against such who making the gospel a meer trade to live on ingross that trade wholly to your selves and make every man a teacher that has been train'd up at university and can handle his tongue well to talk for the priests and tythes though never fitted for that holy calling by the gift of gods grace or good life witness the general blindness and of the brittish priesthood but own no men as true teachers but deluders and fanatick that in their ministry do but pretend to be immediately gifted and guided by gods infallible spirit and whereas we say that christ iesus receives gifts for all men even for the rebellious also and that no less then this gift that the lord god may dwell in them if they look to him in his light in which he draws nigh unto every man yet contrary both to us and that text out of which you talk which compar'd with that paul alludes to ps
betokens such gifts for the rebellious do you deny all men to have so much as the least measure of such light as however attended to can lead to god oe to witness gods dwelling in them

the eighteenth is from eph
where paul prayes that god would give them the spirit of wisdome and revelation of the knowledge of him that the of their understandings might be enlightned the opinion of the qua say they of each mans light in him a sufficient safe rule and guide in his way to god makes it unnecessary to pray for the spirit to enlighten mens eyes in the knowledge of god therefore indeed it is impious
rep who would think men should be so blind unless they wilfully shut their own eyes having some grace some measure of light renders it needless it seems by these seers to pray for more and praying for more and more of gods spirit light and grace supposes it seems that there's yet none at all and so upon this account the church of the ephesians as yet had no illumination by the spirit any more then the rest of men because there was prayer made that they might be enlightned and david had none of gods spirit because he prayes to be established more and more by it and the humble have none of that grace of god at all which is sufficient because they may have and god promiseth to give them more what is this for divines to be found in the nineteenth is urged from psa
who can understand his errors in brief to this effect no men understand their errors therefore each mans light in him is not a sufficient and safe rule and guide to him in his way to god

rep
if the falmists interrogation affirmative concludes negatively and exclusively of any mens having any sufficient light then it concludes universally also against all mens having any such light and so upon this account the saints themselves are excluded as having no such light as well as other men sith according to and ts sense on that place they understand not all the errours of their lives but and will not deny but the saints have some measure of such light and therefore why others have not though they use it not that ignorance of all their errors notwithstanding is more then these two men can give any good reason for

the twentieth from act

runs thus god commands all men every where to repent of their ignorant worship of him therefore each mans sight in him is not a sufficient guide for him to go by in gods worship
rep from which premises contrariwise conclude thus viz therefore all and each man every where though few heed it hath a sufficient light in him from god as the heathen had though they glorified and worshipped him not according to that light and knowledge of him they had rom
to guide him aright in gods worship who commands no impossibilities nor injoyns any man to worship him otherwise then answerably to what of himself and of his will is by his own light made manifest in him
the
is from prov
rom
on this wise the quakers opinion concerning each mans own light in him makes men proud and lifted up and prudent in their own sight to which wo is isa
and to lean to their own understanding and not to depend on god for teaching them in his wayes therefore rep cuius contrarium verum est if by own light these men straggle so far from the question in hand as to intend as they seem to do mans own wisdome thoughts conceits imaginations no men in the world call men more out of these things so plainly so earnestly so constantly as the quakers do but if they be steady in their dispute as good disputants ought to be ad rem substratam to the matter debated which is some measure of the true light of god and the calling to this is so far from making men lean to their own understanding and independent on gods teachings that there's no man in the world can be said truly to be low emptied of self mean in his own eyes to trust in the lord with all his heart and in all his wayes to acknowledge him to leave leaning to his own understanding to stand in gods counsel which woe to him who does not isa to learn of god and depend on him alone for teaching to hear his voice though he scrape with the scribes daily in the scriptures themselves iob
till he betake himself to attendance to that which god sayes and shews in him by the measure of that light wherewith god shines into his conscience wo therefore unto these men that call gods counsel mans conceit they are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight though in the sight of god and his saints not yet weaned from their foolishness as they are also of that generation that are pure in their own eyes though not yet washed nor believing that while they live here they can perfectly be washed from their filthiness

the
is no other then the same with the
though alluding to two other texts from which they fetch them viz iudg
psal
in those dayes there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes and they went a whoring with their own inventions where they make doing after mens own thoughts conceits inventions and looking to or following the light within us synonimous and this last a sign of wicked men and going a whoring from god and departing from god unsafe and such like concluding thus viz
the truth is god forbid the following of our own supposed light as the greatest impiety which the quakers place all their godliness in

rep
this is nought but another impudent lye against the quakers as well as a most evidently foolish extravagancy from the question which is not about our own supposed light but some measure of that undoubted light of god which though ignorantly by you stiled natural yet is not denied to be true light and that from god and not our own supposed only so to be
the quak place none of their godliness in such meer supposed light as ye do who suppose the ignis fatius of your dark and silly and suppositions on the letter as sufficient light for all people to live by their faith stands not in mans wisdome nor in that science of you opposite schoolmen which is falsly so called and supposed but in that real infallible light within which is the and power of god and as for al departure and going a whoring from god and his light within after mans own inventions and thoughts in things of god which is that impiety of the priests that god forbids and abominates we deny and abhor it also

the
which is from the first of the two last texts and the which is from pro

are both also besides the business and urg'd in disproof of that sufficiency of supposed light and the way that seems right only in mans eyes and is not so this we have nothing to do with

but deny it against the priests who unawares to themselves are walking therein as the way to death but that we plead for is the true light iohn
which lightens every man and is the only true way that leads to life

and whereas the consequence of their
seems to be to this effect if every man had a light in him sufficient to guide him in right and good wayes then kings and rulers should not punish men for walking in the wrong and evil wayes that seem good and right in their own eyes

rep contrariwise conclude that if men had not such a light in them as is sufficient to guide them in good wayes then kings and rulers should not punish them for going into evil wayes for as twere an unjust thing to require not of him that seeing will not see as those math

of such a blind man as never could see to see the right way which was never shewed him and to punish him for not walking therein so were it in rulers to punish men for following filthy wayes and evil things if they did not videre meliora see and know how to do better for to him who knows good and does it not evil and declines it not both which are known by the light that is in the world in men though some

for want of heed say the light in the conscience shews the evil but not the good to him only it is sin to condemnation

the
from prov
concludes that if each man have some such true light in him then there's no need of training up children in whose hearts foolishness is bound up in the way they should go by the rod and teaching for what need of the rod say they then to drive fully out
rep reply to drive it out and bring them into the way of wisdom which is in them and seen by them but not much heeded till they smart far it as well as the way of folly this argument holds as much against gods correcting such whom ye confess to know his will and do it not as against our correcting children whom we correct for not doing what we know they know they shold do for no father but he that's foolish will whip his child for any thing as a fault but that which his child knew to be so so fools come to be plagued sayes the spirit because of offences they fly out into that if they be not incorrigible they with the wife may look well to and ponder their goings
our doctrine concerning all mens knowing in some measure by his light within themselves the good will of god destroyes not but establishes the whip for the horse the bridle for the afs and the rod for the back of such fools as turn aside from the truth that's told them into folly nor does this any more conclude against teaching children then with both which it is consistent for the end of our teachings of both are to turn them to attend to the light and truth it self within them that doth teach them yea even children as they come to a few years of discretion remember well that before could read the scripture which could read when very young knew by that of god in me and not from my parents only whose witness without could not have been credited therein by me had not the witness of god which is the greater testified the same within my self that should not lye and was judged with fears of wrath if ever made a lye as children are apt to do to escape a whipping for a lesser fault
if then it be ask't why we teach men and children answer to bring and turn them as paul was sent to do from the darkness in which they walk beside it into the light which whether they walk in it or no is yet in them and because they are not come to it as all true men do but hate and decline it with the evil ones whose condemnation it therefore is because though they come not into it it is already come into them iohn
and with this short answer now its brought into my spirit shall here wipe out of the way a whole parcel of pedling queries of baxter about the the light as they lie together in his epistle to the reader before ts book into the pit of darkness from whence they were exerted

would fain quoth he be resolved in these few questions how comes it to pass that all nations that never beard the gospel are utterly void of faith in christ when the nations that have the gospel do generally know him more or less

aus
to say nothing how little true knowledge of god is in these nations that he grants have the gospel meaning in an outward ministry for

else know no nation that hath not some of that light which is gods gospel in them any more then paul did who said the gospel is preached in every creature under heaven col
and rom
have they not all heard the gospel yes verily
the reason why all the nations have so little as they all have is because they come not to the light which is come into them



why did not the world believe in christ even generally before his coming if reason was then a sufficient light ans
how far forth right reason taken not for the bare natural faculty which a fool may have but for that supernatural gift of god whereby to guide men out of all bruitish wayes and his light we restiffe to which is not against but according to right reason are synonimous it matters not to be medled with in this place but to the query reply the same still viz
men came not to that light of god which was in them


why did christ preach himself while he was on earth if the people had sufficient light before ans christ speaking then audibly to the outward ear through that voice he then used preach't himself indeed that he was the light of the world the god and the life and light of men from the beginning and not from that time only of that his outward appearance unto a few iohn
and to this end did he preach himself as a light in men for the word was made flesh and dwelt in us sayes iohn ioh
bidding them believe in the light i.e his light in them and so in himself who is the light that they might be the children of it and walk in the light while they had it and come to the light and such like because the men to whom he preach't thus were not come to that light of his which was come into them

why did he send his apostles to preach through the world if the had sufficient light before ans
to the same end for which he sent iohn ep
that they might walk with god in the light and not in the darkness as they did though the light was in them and which he sent paul to the act
to turn them from the to the light from the power of satan unto god and because men wanted to be instructed which way to look for the life of god which they had lost and because they yee not yet come into that light of god that only leads to it which was come into them


why did he set pastors and teachers in his church if all have a sufficient light within them

ans
that his church which is in god being turned from the world and the darkness of it to the light might by their memorandums of the things they knew pet

be kept stedfast in their watch to the light unmoveable and abundant alwayes in that work of the lord believing in the light which work the world are not yet come to and to abide in christ the light as branches in the vine and in the teachings of the annointing which is the truth and no lye that it might teach them by degrees all things and lead them into all truth as it had into some already that the saints might as branches grow up in all things into him even the express image and likeness of

him who is the one head over all to the body and the express image of the fathers being in whom is no guile for the perfecting of the saints a thing ye seeming saints deny to be attainable in body for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body till all that are begotten into the nature may come into the unity of the faith and knowledge of gods son even unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ eph
joh
joh
finally because men come to the light if not exhorted to continue in their faith in it may again go out from that light of god which unless it take occasion by their wilful departings from it to depart at last from them is come unto them and continually in them



why do the quakers go up and down teaching men their own doctrines if all men have sufficient light already ans
not their own doctrines but the doctrines of christ and to call men into it and to counsel such as are come into it as ioh ep to abide in christs own doctrine or teaching that they as who doth not so hath neither may have both son and the father and because generally are not come into that light of god which is already come into them


why do they cry out against us as being in darkness when all men have sufficient light in them ans
were there no other thing but this one vain thought of yours that there's no difference between mens being in the light and the light's being in them its enough of it self without any more ado to proclaim you to be in darkness for if ye were in the light of common reason that is in you would tell you as well as the scripture that the light shines in the darkness though it comprehends not the light that it shews the way to them that walk beside it though they walk not in it because they hate it but in the darkness which they love more then it being fallen in love with its evil deeds ioh
ioh
and so to the query we say ye are in darkness because ye among other men are not yet come into that sufficient light which if ye would once but singly look to ye should feel is already come into you


will they pray for more light and grace or not if not they are impiously proud if yea then it seems they have not yet light and grace sufficient ans
we do pray for more light and grace and god gives more and more to the bumble as have shewed above but if ye were not with all the climbers up another way iob
either too proud to stoop to come into the knowledge of the truth by the door the light or so blind as to groap the wall like them that have no eyes ye could not but see that their praying for more and gods giving more grace unto the humble is so far from evincing that they have none as that it evidently evinces they have some already for if men had no grace and should pray for it they might be said to pray for some but no man can be properly said to pray for more light and grace but such as at least have some already



whereas they say the light within is sufficient if obeyed our question is whether it be sufficient to make men obey it that's the grace we are speaking of that causeth men to hearken believe and obey for faith is not of your selves but it is the gift of god and mens hearts must be opened as lydia's was act
to hear abd receive the truth revealed
now to say that the light

or grace which is given to cause us to believe and obey is sufficient if we will believe and obey is ridiculous as if christ should have said to lazarus will raise thee if thou will raise thyself

ans
here sits besides the cushion as much as he that queries beside the question for that's not the grace we are speaking of that is sufficient to cause men to obey but that which is sufficient if obeyed that's the testimony the qua bear to the light of god it is saving to such as walk in it and if it be not sufficient grace from god to baxter that he hath given him a light that will lead him to life if he will follow it but he lacks more even to be caused to walk in that light or else he quarrels with it as not enough and with that grace of gods as no grace because he is not compelled by force to accept of it he may fret himself till he fry in the fire of his own peevish spirit before he shall find such a grace from god to his salvation while himself lives in the neglect of that he has like the unprofitable servant that charges god foolishly as a hard master though he hath given him a talent to trade with unless while he sits still god force him to trade with it whether he will or no
as for us called quakers we judge god hath done well for us in working in us to will and to do i.e the power and hath though not in r.bs compulsive way caused us put us into a capacity to work it out and left us as he looks all men should do when he has done the other phil

to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling and that he doth by a ministry without and a measure of his spirit within counselling us open our hearts as he did lydia to attend to what himself and his servants say and if ever we believe in his light to our life that faith is his gift though our act as tis his gift that we may or have power either to sit or and of his grace our act when we either to stand or sit nor we count it ridiculous as does to say that gods light and grace is sufficient to bring us to life if we attend it though god leave us to chuse when he hath given it us whether we will improve it or turn it nor was it ridiculous in christ to say to lazarus will raise thee if thou will raise by self for christ having done in his part in quickning left lazarus to his part in rising and in effect said the same which counts ridiculous viz lazarus come forth which if lazarus had not done he might have perisht in that sepulchre for all christ had quickned him so as to him the power to come forth for christ would not have him out by force if he had to come forth when he called him nor any more then twas in god to say hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see

but as for this man and his fellows tis not grace enough nor sie it seems if a man invite poor folks to dinner and prepares meat enough for all comers and bids his guests welcome when they are come and compels them by all earnest perswasion to sit down and bids them as god does eat friends drink yea drink abudantly beloved when they are unless when they refuse he open their mouths in some forcible manner and cause them to eat all that is set before them such troublesome guests as these of which sort are and

the rest that look for such a compulsive causing when the grace of a sufficient feast is vouch fast unto them are not fit to sit at great mens tables much at gods and by my consent he that unless he be forcibly fed refuses to feed when the meats before him whether it be at a feast of sat things of mans making or of gods shall while others hearken and let their souls delight themselves in fatness have his choice to sit still and as the proverb is may fast and welcome
conclude then as to query that god puts men into capacity to come to the light if they will not chuse darkness before it that light is sufficient to save if obeyed yet all men who all have of it are not saved by it and the reason is because they will not come to that light of which in gods good will towards them in come into them



but how can light be sufficient were a man never so obedient to reveal that which was never manifested by it or by any that doth accompany it no light among the heathens in america doth tell them that christ was incarnate died rose ascended or intercedeth for us or is the king priest or teacher of his church or will raise the dead and judge the world how then can this light be sufficient to bring them to the belief of this ans
is the light in america then any more insufficient to lead its followers to god then the light in europe asia africa the other three parts of the world have ever lookt upon the light in all men since began to look to it in my self as one and the light in all where it is in sort and kind though different in degree and measure which varies not the nature of any thing and that according to the measure of it and in as its attended to withall it shews the same things in all men as to the mysty substance and of them though the outward history of this in an outward letter some may be better skill'd the ein then some
wot how cornelius came to be accepted in his prayers and almes as a man truly fearing god before by an outward ministry he ever heard of christ dying rising ascending interceding after all things were outwardly and actually transfacted also since all you agree and we with you that out of the knowledge of christ the light there's no acceptance at all with god nor in any other name either iustification or was it not in his obedience to the light he had which came from the light though as yet he knew him not after the and by what light did they who wrote of christs incarnation death resurrection
see them before they wrote as some did viz who saw his day before any history or letter of your scripture at all was

was it not by that as they walk on with god in it from abel enoch noah and downward some measure of which but that they minded it not as some few did but were ever alienated from it walking in their own wayes was in all nations as well as some and not more save only in measure in the prophets then in other men and did not this light without and the letter help some even such still as walk't after it to the belief of this and that god would raise the dead and judge the world which they wrote in the light and spirit in which they saw it and in

that wisdome which in all ages wisd
entering into holy souls that heed it makes them friends of god and prophets were these things then as thinks in his query never manifested by the light without the letter nor by any revelation that doth accompany the light were men never so obedient to it what darkness is this of in his ten queries who yet to pin the basket at the end of this tenth query to add weight to the lightness and light to the darkness of it adds one more of his own thoughts and odd conceits in these words


think its past controversie that no man hath sufficient to his salvation till his last breath for if god add not more for his preservation all will be lost
ans
by which hasty speech the man proclaims his being in the darkness and besides the light that is in him so loud and exalts its and sets it so on high that all may see it save such as are with him in the dark where he is for besides the absurdity above spoken to of his arguing from gods adding more and mens not having so much yet as they may have that therefore they have none at all of that grace which is sufficient he turns from the true terms of his question taking the word here in quite another sense then it hath been taken in along viz for the highest only of that grace of god when as the question is about the sufficiency of it to save from that sin it shews such as keep to it in the very least degree and lastly expresly contradicts the scripture which speaks of the suffiency of god grace to keep men that keep to it in such degrees of it as are attainable in this life witness that of god to paul full fourteen years behind the time wherein he spake it and many more before the time of his last breath cor
my grace is sufficient thee
conclude then all bs queries notwithstanding that though all are not saved by it yet all have some of that light and grace which is and that all are not saved as some are it is they come not into that light and grace god which is come and unto them
and now return to r.b and i.ts
arguments against this whose iohn


is thus there's need of a further drawing or gift of the that a man may come to christ as there would not if his own light without other help would make known christ to him therefore each mans own light is not sufficient rep here layes on hard again upon the anvil beside the iron in the sufficiency of mans own light by which he means mans thoughts which we count and foolishness much more then himself does when the question is about the light of in the heart of which we say that though none can come to christ without draw him yet by that all though not after and so the why they perish still is not because god does not to life by a light sufficient to lead to it but because they resist hang back and will nto follow it therefore sayes god drew them with the of my love with the bands of a man yet shall they go into captivity because they refused to return

believe not every spirit but try the spirits prove all things take heed what ye hear is thus

if each persons light within him were a safe guide of it self to god then no men need to try other mens spirits nor to prove all things left he be deceived sith if he follow his own light he is fallible
but these things are absurd and to the warinest christ prescribes therefore the light within each person is not a sufficient guide to god

shall instead of his own light placing the light of god about which only the dispute is syllogize these mens silly back upon them thus if the light of god within each person were not a sufficient and safe to lead him to god then no man need to trouble much as to try other mens spirits or prove all things left he be deceived for that is but labour in vain sith if he have not a measure of gods infallible light and spirit in whereby to judge of things even of that light of which the letter sayes that all that are to be reproved eph
are by it and no truth is manifested but by it which only leads into all truth he is not guided nor undoubtedly sure of his hand let him look search prove and try as much as he will any more then a man can infallibly and distinguish of colours in a dismal dark night or dark place where not one beam of the sun shines so as to discover them but these things are absurd and contrary to the wariness that christ prescribeth who doth not bid men try all things by that light and spirit of god which only makes all truth and all that is knowable of god and all things of god manifest in men rom
and yet not them one beam of that only sufficient light to try any thing by yea twere no less then as meer mockage as to bid a man read for his life in a dark dungeon without sufficient light either of sun or candle or take heed to by that light that shines in a dark place pet

when there's no true light there at all and contrary also to all common and reason therefore there is in every man some of that light of god which as its according to the measure of it is able to guide him infallibly to judge of the matters truths wayes spirits he is bid to try on peril of being deceived to damnation and a sufficient safe guide to lead him unto god
wonder what light spirit rule and all truth and all spirits are to be tryed by if not by that measure of the spirit of truth it self which convinces the world of sin righteousness and iudgement and leads its followers into all truth
ob
if any say it can't be that spirit of god nor his light in men the qua call to for that's one of the things to be tryed try the spirits whether of god or no and that which is to be tryed cannot be the rule of tryal

ans
answer why not did you schoolmen never learn that lesson your selves which ye teach to others viz that regula which is alwayes quid rectum is sui obliqui the strait rule must ever be the or measure of it self as well as of that which is crooked and faulty doth not the light manifest it self to be true light as well as the darkness to be truly darkness and does not the sun as well shews it self to a man to be the sun as it shews a dark cloud or smoak not to be it and why may not the inward light which is truly and is only it fallible be truly said to be autopiste believed for it self sake and to be the rule of tryal

that must try all spirits and sayings but its own yea its own also as falsly sayes nor more nor less but the of the outward fallible because flexible letter which flows forth from it

say tis true we are to try all spirits and things but as what man knows the things of a man but the spirit of a man within himself even so the things of knows no man but the spirit of god and that spirit in which that of god reveals them gor what shall we try light and by but by the light know our divines say try all spirits by the scripture all so called whether they be true or pretended by the letter but herein they discover their own dancings of the rounds still in the night of their own thoughts and in the midst of the mist of darkness foramuch as no otherwise then as when we ask them what's the rule they go by in their analogical faith they say the scriptures and when we ask them what's the rule they go by in their interpreting that rule of their faith i.e the scriptures they tell us the analogy of their faith even so when we ask them what are ye to try the scriptures by whether they are of god or no they say by the spirit yea though other things may be accessary yet the testimony of the spirit is and only to this so sayes not only in his but also all the builders of babel and of baal in what form soever excepring popish priests who are in a worse extreme and deny as no rule for their own traditions sake both scriptures and spirit altogether but when we ask them but how shall we try that spirit of god whether of god or no for we are not believe every spirit to go round again they tell us by the scriptures and thus the poor clergy are cozened and how those they lord it over should scape and creep out of their babylonish confusion know not till they come to that and some such thing there is or else there's no knowledge of any thing which is of a certainty past all that as to a blind man it can't be proved so to a seeling man in need not and that is the light of god in the which as heeded and according to the measure of it shews both it and darkness truth and deceit good and evil what god would have each man do for his own particular and what to decline de iure what sins he lives in that he should forgo what sins he does or does not forgo de facto e.g lying cozening cheating drunkenness adultery murder doing that ill to be would not have done to himself and such like what manner of man he is upright or wicked a man or an hypocrite
and all this though internally and spiritually yet as truly and as with his bodily eyes by the light of the sun or but a candle he sees himself and with his natural animal understanding he perceives himself to be a man and not a beast

search me god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting is thus if david had a light within him of it self a sufficient and safe guide to god he should no need to search know and try him he might have led himself but tis otherwise with david therefore he knew he had not a light within him

rep oh most absurd and abominable how do evil men and seducers war worse and worse and being deceived twas darkness gross enough to the being of a sufficient light to guide to god in all but this is grosser yea no then to deny it to be in men for if it be in any men it is surely in the saints and if in them then in whom they own as one yet behold the as and ds of our times tell us now that david himself who sayes thy word have hid in me that might not sin against thee
which word calls a lamp to his feet and a light to his paths had not a light within him as a sufficient safe guide to lead in the way everlasting and consequently the saints to whom nemine obstante paul sayes according to the word is nigh thee in thy heart the word faith which we preach had none of it in them as well as sinners
but that they may not insanire sine they give a reason for it such as tis viz
if david had a light of god within him sufficient he need not to search know try and lead him he might have led not heeding that all the saints that are taught by the light and in that learn in silence in all subjection are not autodidactoi as these men suppose but as paul saith all saints are theodidactoi learning of christ and taught of god
that the qua deny all teaching but that of god or men moved by the same and spirit by which god teaches yea acknowledge freely that he that teaches himself and learns not of god but leans to his own understanding as the clergy does hath but a fool to his master yet so far as david needed god to know and try his heart and thoughts so far he needed gods light within him there being no way whereby god who searches the heart and tryes the reins to give to everyman according to his wayes both searches sees and shews unto man his thoughts and leads him in the way everlasting but by his own spirit light and word within man which alone is to that end quick and powerful sharper then any two edged sword piercing and dividing asunder between the marrow and reins soul and joynts and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so that not any thing is bid from the sight thereof but all things are naked and bare before him with whom we have to do so far as with that word and light which is gods own witness within man whereof the letter which is mans witness for god without man testifies which leads to the light while that light and truth it points at leads only to the life and way everlasting of which sayes the psalmist send out thy light and truth that they may lead and that they may guide and conduct me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacle

is thus what advantage then hath the ierk and what is there in circumcision if each gentile had a light within him as a sufficient guide in the things of god as the qua teach then they had known gods statutes and iudgements gods oracles had been committed to them as well as to the iews they had had as righteous statutes and been as wise a nation as they but these consequents are false and contrary to the texts

rep
the advantage the iew or circumcision outward according to the flesh and letter not spirit over the gentile or uncircumcision outward in the flesh and letter was much every way and yet not so much as is inconsistent with each gentiles having some measure of gods light within and the profit that the circumcision had which ye repeat your selves yet are so blind that ye cannot see it was in that chiefly mark to them were committed the oracles of god which term chiefly be tokens that in some and measure the oracles of god were committed to the uncircumcision also which term could not be properly used if the other had them not at all if one should say the angel or ecclesiastical leaders of the church of england are chiefly first or principally blinded that would intimate that the people are in some measure blind though not so much as their clergy in things of god
so this advantage the iew had in that preaching the covenants and and tenders of gods grace was chiefly or first for the word is proton rom

again they had the tables of the covenant and the outward letter and the types and shadows of the good things and the earthly canaan kingdome city ierusalem dominion dignity and glory that were the figures of the true besides a measure of the inner light that led to the substance and that the eternal life lay in which the gentile had some of together with them so the iew still had the and prity had they had the consideration to have improved it but the price being put into their hands and they like fools not using it nor looking through all this to the end of the things now abolished nor to the light and power of the endless life but to the letter and law only of a carnal commandment which they boasted of and yet brake it they lost that preheminence and let the gentiles them and be chief as to the iustification and they themselves became chiefly condemned rom
shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfill the law judge thee who by the letter circumcision dost transgress the law and verse

though they have not seen me with bodily eyes yet in spirit they believe that thing that say but if we speak of the true circumcision which is that of the heart and spirit not of the letter and of the true iew inwardly his advantage over the iew outward and the outward gentile his advantage is indeed over all for his praise is not of men but of god himself and this is that israel of god and that iew and not the synagogue of satan that say they are iews and are not but do lye rev

he sheweth his word unto jacob his statutes and his iudgements unto israel he hath not dealt with nation and as for his statutes and they have not known them for howbeit it the natural iew outward knows much that his tells him and by the outward hearing of the ear the outward statutes and of god and also the outward gentile though nominally christian by his light within as well as that natural iew by that and his letter too knows the iudgements of god rom

yea these are that nation of israel and not that which is now become a curse and perished out of what ever nation or people they are gathered into the one light and spirit of whom its said who is like unto thee a people saved by the lord who rideth on the for thy help and in that of these mens quoting deuter

what nation is there so great that hath statutes and iudgements so righteous as all this law which is set before them in the light their keeping and doing of which shall be their wisdome and understanding in the sight those nations which though now they count them fools shall at last see themselves to have been infatuaated and say of gods now dispersed and seed of israel after the spirit surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people

and as for others though as and ye all say god hath not dealth so richly with any as he does with them that receive the riches of his grace and they have not known his iudgements in such a measure as these know them yet all as they heed the light in that may know them as in some degree the heathen heeding the light are said to do rom
and degrees never vary the nature of a case neither follows it that because some know not so much as some therefore many neither do nor for want of light can know nothing of the gospel or saving truth of god at all

the from rom
is thus the light within neither did to paul nor doth nor can discover sin even the sin of lust without the law therefore the light within each person is not a sufficient guide of it self to lead to

god and to warrant mens actions without the written word scripture with them

rep why not as well as before the law was written in an outward letter at all if by the law ye will needs understand nothing but outward scripture for some sure knew lust before moses wrote the law
but in very deed how deeply soever ye dream in this as ye do in most things this law without which the lust is not well known is no other then the light it self within for the letter sayes lust is a sin but tis the light that shews thy lust to filth envy or any evil to be thy sin within thy self and that law by which the knowledge of sin comes is that law and commandment which prov
is said to be the light and the lamp even the that david hid of him that he might see the way of that was hid in his heart and so not sin against by which only the young man in whom lust is strong taking heed thereunto shall come to cleanse his way which is never clean while he hangs only on the lips of and meer who lauding the holy life they not in are at best but lyars when they preach the but this being elsewhere handled shall need to say the less of it here
so having done with these two mens thirty arguments a few words more to their ten against the true light in all men and then have done with them as to that
reason
because what each man conceives according to his light within him cannot be right and for one mans conceits do sometimes contradict anothers nor are quak all of one mind when they follow the light within them

rep
this is one of your own odd conceits indeed but far from truth and good consequence that the light or rule it self cannot be true or right or a safe rule because mens conceits of things to be or not be according to it may be contradictory one to another and so not both true tis true conceivings one rule be both true but he contradicts truth and common who conceives the rule or light it self to be ere the worse or ere the less a true rule or light because of that two men may have and conceits whereof one must needs be false about a piece of cloths agreeing or nor agreeing with the or measure but it follows nor therefore from any thing but these faithless mens false and foolish fancies that the is not a yard or no good rule or measure and if this were good consequence and but that they are blind still might see it conclude more strongly against their letters being as they plead it to be the only true light or then against the light since there's as many silly senses misty meanings and contradictory conceits in the minds of them that are ministers of it almost as they are ministers of it for whereas they tell us of two qua contradicting one another have told these four men i.o t.d r.b i.t of contradicting one another many times o're in their books against us and shall do yet a little more before this book here write be at an end yea truth as have shewed already before and shall do more behind there's little else then confusion and contradiction

to themselves by our men called clergy well nigh in all the doctrines they have to do with besides this rendred by them is not at all against the light of god but against mens meer conceits which we are more against then any men whatever calling men out of their own conceivings into gods own counsel the light so quid hoc ad rem

because that which unvariable and alterable cannot be a persons rule for its the property of a rule to be invariable and the same at all times rules measures weights dials squares and what other things are made if they be varied be rules rules should be fixt and certain but nothing more variable then mens light in them
rep igrant that's no rule which is variable and alterable and therefore have above from hence concluded and do here again from your own premises conclude the letter the rule ye talk for more then walk by not to be that only rule of faith and life as ye would have it but gods light in the heart which the letter came from sith as teaches us in his epistle though he will not learn the same lesson himself but teaches in his book as much against it as he does for it that the letter in the very original copies of it which yet ye count an unalterable rule is variable alterable flexible at criticks wills by the changing of some one point or hebrew letter alike in sound or shape no less then eight several wayes in that one very word undefined span alphabet and some of those as countradictory each to other as life to death as is shewed more at large above besides all various lections that are risen by os confession from the actual mistakes of them it transcribers
but the light however men run out into various conceits and imaginations about this or that which and what is or is not agreeable to it is inviolably the same for ever the councell and foundation of god which is christs light in the heart the rock of ages stands sure let the drunkards of ephraim rock and reel too and fro or ramble about and run out whether they will after their own councells and inventions
reas
the and are both of one unlearned leven and coincident with what's urg'd above viz if the light within men were a safe guide and ride then twere unnecessary unsafe and foolish for men to seek councell of others each might be guided by his also then the meetings of quakers to consult about and in commuon to teach each other or to communicate revelations is needless and vain sith each may guide himself that's done in va by more which may be done by

rep frustra sit per quod porest fleri bene per pauciora that's done in vain by more that may be done as well by lesse
is true but what may be done better by more then fewer is not in vain and therefore as vis unita fortior is true among schollars so in the multitude of councellors there's in many cases so much the more safety is as true among christians yet it proves not but that there's also security to assurance enough wheee every one attends to that of god within himself therefore it's neither unsafe nor foolish as ye affirm but may be both safe and profitable for so the apostles and elders did of old act

who yet in all were guided by the spirit to meet together in councell but its in no wise so absolutely necessary as ye make it to seek for other teachings

then that of the light and spirit of god within in order to each mans holy living much lesse such as is given out in your synods where ye teach gods worship and fear after your own thoughts and traditions yea to such as are turn'd to the spirits teaching tis said ye need not that any man teach you save as the same anointing teacheth you of all things which is truth no lye and if we do hear men speak that are moved by the spirit its not in vain it being all one whether that holy spirit speak in me or in another to me we still own no other teaching but that of the anointing and so the apostles though met in councell yet concluded no other things to be imposed on men then what seemed good to them and the holy spirit which taught them and impos'd not as ye do what seems good to your selves who deny also the guidance of that infallible spirit to be present in the world at this day

reas
then its in vain to desire and expect revelations and discoveries which they had not before sith they have the light within of themselves therefore when they compose themselves to their quaking fits that they may have some word of the lord to speak to people whats this but an hypocriticall devise blasphemous false and unrighteous or else needless sith they have a light within them sufficient to guide them without other revelation rep
this is nothing but an addition to these mens many lyes for which they must know part in the la and of the qua
who own no such thing as a light in men that is of themselves but that only which is though in them yet of god as for composing of themselves to quaking fits hypocriticall devices and pretences of new revelations and much more such like as is reckon'd to them in this reason the qua deny them who expect no other then true revelations of that old true gospell in that way of waiting on god in that true old light and ts title page pretends to exalt but their book ignorantly and impiously depresses as new light and darknesse in which true old light god in the heart it was ever revealed from faith to faith to the just who lived by faith in that light before the letter was
reas
by so much to the light within them satan hath advantage to draw men to hoid acts sith what ever he can imprint on them as their light they must receive it without any examination and obey it
rep what silly stuff is this as if because satan may transform himselfe as an angell of light in mens hearts to decieve them if they look not well to the true light of god that shines therein and receive not the truth told by it in the love thereof therefore there's no true light there shining as if because there's much errour and many lyes that the father of lyes and ruler of the darkness seeks to beguile by and does beguile unstable soules by therefore there's no truth to be beguiled from and to be upon scilicet sic aiunt clamitant non probant

we own to reprove condemn and punish any for doing contrary to the religion and undefiled before god which is morality or good manners and to keep a mans self unspotted of the ill manners and pollutions of the world if the persons so reproved condemned punisht and corrected had not a light in them sufficient to teach them that true religion for all just condemnation must arise from mans having light not loving to live by it and the light only is the worlds condemnation ioh
and as for the last clauses about tutors and schoolmasters vniversities and schools of arts to breed up in literature and good manners as they pretend to do they had more need then any other places and people in this nation to be taught what true religion and good manners are yea the very principles thereof if that light in every mans conscience that teaches them to live honestly righteously and soberly as in truth it is and to keep a mans self unspotted of the world be that pure religion undefiled before god as the scripture sayes it is and not that of those who are pure and religious in their own eyes and yet never mean to be washed from their filthiness have spoken much above how vain they are of all places throughout this nation and add thus in brief that unless they come to be better reformed then ever they have been since knew them they are at this day not for want of a light within but of attending to that light that is in their hearts that teaches them better so full of luxury filth enmity hatred malice against truth insolent scoffing at good men abusive carriages toward the qua in their meetings rudeness violence as that of the horse and mule whose mouths lest they do mischief must be held in with bit and bridle as the schollars have not been of late so much as they should be by either or without in our two vniversities nor by the light in themselves which how ere they bear the names of of religion and have some seeming shews thereof shews all their religion to be in vain iam
that the abode of them in the nations in this deformed state wherein they stand as nurseries of naughtiness more then honesty is rather as it hitherto hath been a way to lay wast all common civility and corrupt all good manners and bring men to barbarism and make the nation a wildess yea an acheldama or field of blood if people every where should be as bloody as the schollars have been at oxford and against the saints witness what's above declared and the late pranks at cambridge since that was written and in sine to drive away the spirit of god among us introduce unclean spirits to repossess us and our lord to expel all that is and all them also that are excellent and may better us as the qua do who seek to bring all men to innocency and honesty a little

of which shall all scholastical sibtilis and piety in the day that are coming on and in a word to fill the nation still which hath been too full of such for many ages and generations upwards with that generation of locusts and caterpillars that have eat up every green thing in it and that whole fffraternity of fools in whom god hath no pleasure who are more ready to offer their cains sacrifices then to hear and obey what god himself saith in them eccles

and lastly to condemn all the sincere hearted saints and honest hearts since the creation which are men of such worth in the world that what ere the worthless wise men thereof say falsly to the contrary the world is not worthy of them of that fully and blindness which is found more among the foresaid fffraternity then among any other whomsoever so that will not say according as they may be ordered how useful such tutors and vniversities may be but as so disorderly as they have been they may not only to every sober eye seem altogether vain and worthless but worse then naught it self and cages of every unclean and hateful bird neither have the many frovolous chaffy formalities that lawyers literature hath led out into proved more destructive to the substance equity and very end of the law which at first was good then that fleshly wisdome and loose kind of literature that is learned at universities that hath led men out into fulness of all filthiness open profaness infinite fopperies under a of piety or form of godliness been destructive hitherto to the very practice and power of it and to the purity of religion and the gospel and though iniquity abounds most openly among as are under their tuition yet twere better then it mostly hath been if teachers and tutors of all whom ye so for were not of those ts by whom are debaunched and truth turned upside both there and in all as well as by and

if every man have a light within him sufficient to guide him then quoth who back by
suppose will grant have such a light within me and if every man is to follow this light then am to follow my light within me now my light within me shews me that the qua
opinion about the light in them is an errour that they pervert souls by bidding men follow it
and this is not only my light but the light of millions besides me yea think all sober men have found their own darkness and ignorance and groaned under it bewailing it to god and applying themselves to the use of such means as might bring light into their souls
conclude that this opinion of the quakers which have refuted is the most opinion that ever was hatched instilled into them by the prince of darkness not by the spirit of and tends to the dissolution both of discipline and civil government yet they say or rather brawl somewhat for their opinion
rep know well enough that thy own light i.t and thine own which is doth dictate to you that the qua testimony to the light of god in men is an errour and a perverting of souls because it converts so many to god and turns them aside from attending any more to them that teach for hire but we say not what ere ye that ye are at all to follow that but what we also testifie to and bid you follow is the light of god

rep
the and thou either have or have had if not now lost it such a light within you from god as is a sufficient safe guide to god and that though its evident ye have not done it you should have followed and if you had you should have known us as now you do not it would have shewed you that the qua
doctrine of the light within is no errour and that they do not pervert but convert souls to god by bidding men follow it and if ye have found by experience your own darkness and ignorance as ye say all sober men have among which you surely count your selves bewail that your darkness unto god and yet apply your selves to the use of such means as may bring the light to shine out into your souls which is to come more soberly then ever yet to the light within you which shews you your own darkness without terming it disparingly errour delusion conceit and as i.o does jeeringly figment the infallible doctor know not what god the imagined christ of the qua some spiritual every thing truly nothing lest at last indeed not walking in it while you have it your light go out in obscure lest it be totally taken from you and you cast into the utter darkness never to see the light of god in whose light the qua see light any more the best light in you then being but merae tenebrae caecitas blindness and darkness it self but if it be so that the best light in all or any of you four have mostly more or less had to do with throughout this book in answer to your selves and all men that are of your dark minds about the light be already become darkness oh how great is that darkness the gospel is then hid indeed to them that are lost though wish you well yet cannot help it any more then you yet just it is upon you for your flying out in such fiery twittle twattles and fierce fightings against his light and god is righteous in taking vengeance yet will hope better things of you till see the worst and desire that ye may yet know the things that make for your peace before they be hid for ever from your eyes howbeit for the truths sake as well as in love to your souls shall not spare the same sharpness towards you as you are found in against the light and it
conclude against you in your own kind that this opinion of yours and divines concerning christs not enlightning all men in any wise with saving light in contradiction to that undeniable truth in this point the qua testifie to is the most sottish opinion that ever was hatched instilled into you and others by the prince of darkness not by the spirit of god and tends to the dissolution both of all religion for what religion can all men be call'd to if all men be not by christ enlightned to do what he would have them and all civil government also yet the blind guides of the blind whom they draw with them into the ditch who will say something against every thing rather then own truth as it is in iesus do say or rather brawl somewhat for that their opinion which is sufficiently already above refuted

chap
vi having done with the doctrine concerning the universality of the true lights being in some measure in all men which leads such as are led by it unto life and with the rest which the priests generally oppose the qua in as at first propounded
shall now fall upon some brief animadversion of their piteous arguments against it and poor answers to our plain arguments for it wherewith the priests resist and withstand the truth as its testified to by the qua called as to that point of perfection as to the possibility of purgation and real remission of sin and full freedome from any more commission of it whether actually or assentatively in this life
as for and
as after a long unquiet quarrel with the qua who call men to no other at all about the light and spirit of christ as such foolish fires as will lead men into nothing but bogs and praecipices page
and much more of that sort themselves fall a calling and commending all men to the same in many good words of exhortation specially in the last sermon of their book which consists of exhortations to the light doctrine or teaching of christ within excepting here and there as the manner of most parish ministers is a perenthesis or interpositition of now and then some dirty dashes and filthy flerts against it to sence men off from ever coming too neer it lest it make them wiser then their teachers and leaders and so lead and take them off from taking much more heed to the wind of their whiffling words and tangling talk of truth for tith so they are principled against the foresaid perfections atainbleness in this life as is evident in other of baxter's and ts his works yet in this book of theirs that have at present to do with mind not at present where they contradict it but are found in sundry expressions much rather confirming and preaching it unawares and ministring mediums in proof of it e.g
where they tell us thus r.b j.t christ leads alwayes in the right way so that whosoever follows him
rep
and some do surely these men are not so ignorant sure as to deny that
r.b j.t shall be directed aright in his way be guided into the way of peace
rep that must needs be out of all sin for every sin or transgression is the wrong way the way of wickedness and theres no peace saith god unto the wicked
and
where they tell us thus r.b j.t christs words have such precepts and revelations as make a man spirituall heavenly wise like unto god

rep which if any sinner be and be not rather carnall earthly foolish unlike god and lke the devill then am yet to seek and if these sinners

and pleaders for mens necessity of sinning while they live and yet call themselves saints can tell me otherwise let them tell me what a saint and what a sinner is and
where they tell us thus

r.b i.t
all that christ spake
rep whose speeches were and are successefull to accomplish their end among some at least assuredly or else let these men speak it out if they dare that christ never obtains his end in speaking to any at all to whom he speakes
r.b i.t
it was to ease the burthen
rep
and such the least in is where ere it is whether it be felt or no
r.b i.t to direct to god
rep whom no sinner in his sins can come to
r.b i.t to reform the evils in gods worship
rep whom no evill doer or sinner in his sins can worship any more accceptably then cain whose sacrifice was shut out while his sin lay at the door or then david himself whose prayer would not be heard if he regarded iniquity in his heart and every one does so more or lesse while in the least he commits it or else surely he would not commit it no man doing that he hath no regard at all unto but he who remaines yet under the devills power taken captive by him at his will having not yet attained to that liberty wherewith christ euen here makes many free and even here is by him attainable if men with paul who throw the warfare at last attain'd it be sincere in the same way of pressing after it
i.t
to take men off from covetousness hypocrisie and such evills as are pernicus
rep
and if the least motion to sin if assented to not else be any otherwise then so and not in some measure pernicious though some great ones may be more greatly pernicious then other some let that of god in the conscience of these men judge when paul sayes the motions of sins which warr'd in his members while he was yet under the law and not in the liberty of christ and but in the combate and short of the conquest brought forth fruit in him unto death and iames
that if lust be but perrmitted to conceive as it does in such a degree as any one is led away after it it bringeth forth sin and sin when its finished or brought forth into its being as it is when lust is but assented to and the mind genders to gether with it it bringeth forth death
r.b j.t with what ever else might bring nigh to god
rep whom all sin even the least in some though some more then some separates the soul from
r.b j.t
and alienate men from this present evil world
rep which every man is nigh to more or lesse till he be totally taken off and alienated utterly from the corruptions that are in it through lust
r.b j.t
and accordingly so were and are the effects regeneration or new birth mortification of the deeds of the body the salvation of man

rep
and if these were and are as ye say they were and are not only the ends but also the effects of what christ spake or speakes then by such as continue to heare his voice and follow him and not such strangers to him as ye are and so some did and now do yea ever all his own shp all

these things in time even here both were and are attainable and attained also that ye speak which are ipsissima the very things we plead against you for in the point of perfect freedom from sin wherein ye oppose us viz mortification of the deeds of the body which is never effected till every sin be destroyed or subdued so as not to be so much as assented to much lesse acted the very least being a deed or member of the body of it and mortification effected no lesse but somewhat more if more can be then a common killing in our common english acceptation of it even a mangling the dead body of it all to pieces regeneration which however taken by our dimm divines for the first act of conversion onely or beginning to face about from sin towards god is a real new birh or being begotten back into that divine nature which man in sin is degeneraled from and not onely so but also as taken in its right latitude and consummation not initiation only for the thing or end effected so ye speak and not prosecuted onely the growth up in that image of christs divine nature in whom was no sin to the very measure of the fulness of his stature eph
and salvation of man which is not in but from the sin first before ever there be any right rejoycing in god or any true salvation from the sorrows that are entail'd to it by him who came to save his people from their sins who in this sense mainly is sent forth as a light to enlighten us and raised up as an horn of salvation in us his people that we being delivered from all our enemies among which sin even in our selves is the chiefest and from the hands of all that hate us as all sinners do such as preach to them that unpleasing doctrine of perfect purging from the sins they love might serve him without fear in holinesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of our life

for as much therefore as in this book of r.b and t.d
find them at present uttering so much as that above and perhaps more but that hasten that makes for it and yield us arguments out of that their own armory in proof of that perfect freedom from sin here which we plead for but nothing directly against it though they are against it shall therefore having made use of that little of theirs above that is very much to our purpose against them quit these
r.b and i.t
and addresse more directly to i.o and t.d's
deliveries of themselves as against that doctrine
and as for i.o
have so much the lesse to say to him by how much tis but little that he meddles in that matter throughout that whole book of his have herein had to do with but for as much as that little in bulk is as stark naught as it's nothing to his purpose he must excuse me if for truths sake be as blunt with him as he is keen and bloody against the teachers of it and as plain in opening his contradiction to him as tis plain that he contradicts himselfe in what he sayes against it in the very sight and open view of all men

confess he dilates not so largely against it as t.d does but barely and nakedly nibbles about the business yet he puts forth such a paw as wherby we may guesse how rudely unreasonably rampant he would be in his repulses of us in that point if we that hold it were not as much out of his reach as tis out of the reach of the best wisdome he hath

to render one solid reason at all against it

one thing that i.o sayes whereby we may clearly conclude him to be one who as cloudily concludes there's no attainment to a perfect purging from sin in this life is this viz
having in proof of its perfection from its efficacy to effect its own end spoken above of the immediate end of the scripture to be

direction in our knowledge of god and that obedience that is due to him that doing his will as none when he sins does we may attain salvation which is from sin sure or from nothing and the enjoyment of himselfe and told us that the perfection of all discipline consists in its efficacy to effect its own end so that that onely is to be held perfect which is sufficient to effect its end and that imperfect which is not of force to effect it and how in this very respect the scripture is a most perfect rule as it accomplishes its foresaid end and telling us also that the use of the scripture by which this end is effected is only in this present world sith the scripture ceases as to all its uses ends and purposes in that to come and consequently must either effect that its end even our perfect salvation from sin here or not at all so prove it selfe to be contrary to what i.o sayes of it viz no perfect rule he tells us withall to the utter contradiction of his assertion as to the scridtures perfection being it semes principled against the qua as to the point of perfecting holyness so as to cleansing from all sin and left hee run upon that dangerous rock of runing out of all lust while he lives here that its a most false thing to affirm that the holy scripture doth or can while we are in this world obtain all its own end in respect of us which end he had said before is our obeying god and doing his will which is not to sin iohn
and our salvation which is from sin thus incidit in scyllam
the man of sin to avoid one extream which he is extreamly against viz being ruined against the rock of perfection he runs down extreamly into another viz the gulf of self contradiction and confusion
verbum sat sapienti need do no more to the opening of this round to wisemen then to set it down before them thus for this is the sum of os sayings nothing is perfect but what effects its end the end of the scripture is making men perfect this end the scripture cannot effect in this life for heres no perfection nor can the scripture effect this end in the life to come for there it ceases to work and effects nothing at all yet the scripture the perfection of which can consist in no other thing then its effecting its end which end it never effects is for that most perfect

what more i.o sayes in short is this that the

fanaticks so he is pleas'd still to stile the qua a seed among whom some at least are the most sincere saints that are at this day upon the earth are not perfect deceits bainour wickednesses and hypocrisies do testifie to us but in very deed punishments and imprisonments ought to be inflicted upon them that impudently glory that they are free from all these and other sins even the least

rep i.o it seems and the rest of his gang of ghostly fathers and godly gameliels are sentenced already by himself as worthy to be persecuted in such wise as the qua have been at oxford by his means and punisht and imprisoned as impudent boasters if ever they shall pretend whilst here on earth to be free from lying and fraud and wickedness and hypocrisie and other sins specially if from the least or from all uncleanness of flesh and spirit all ungodliness and worldly lusts which yet they'l tell men sometimes in a sound of stoln words from those texts of paul cor
tit

they must cleanse themselves from deny and have nothing to do with in this present world because else there's no purging in the world to come so that we see what fruits we are to expect from that fraternity of false prophets and what little likelihood of peoples being much profited by these stealers and sellers of the apostles good words when they believe it even impossible that the things they impose in the name of god themselves or any people here where they say it must be done if ever should be impowred to perform


query whether if paul had come to oxford in the time of i.os there and made the same modest confession to the praise of god no other then which the best of the qua ever made which he made that he was once in his own conceit alive without the law or till he and the law the light came to face each other but when that came then he saw sin was alive in him and he dead and that he was then while beginning to war with it sold under it and captivated by it and wretched by reason of it rom
but that now when he wrote this the law of the spirit of life or light in his mind which was by christ had made him free from law of sin and which warr'd in his members and oft enslav'd him say when paul made this and many other modest acknowledgements of gods grace and power towards him in delivering him and how now he walkt not after the flesh but the spirit and how holily and justly and unblameably he and other apostles behaved themselves thes


and should have said as to the same effect he did that they were no lyars nor deceivers nor wicked ones nor hypocrites and cor
could do nothing against the truth as every sin is but for the truth and such like whether i.o would have punisht him as an impudent boaster yea or no and have put him in where besides whippings and other punishments and some of the qua have been put if yea see what kind of provision the poor flock of christ

must expect from out of the silken snapsacks of these university shepherds and overseers if they had the of all corrective as much as they have it directive over magistrates and all and what a generation of godly ministers as they have been call'd have grown up under pretence of reformation of late even in old england which has been so long renewing as well as in which is now growing old again where they punish the same seed to where however they idolize christs holy apostles now they are dead would no less then persecute them were they now alive if nay would know quo iure some reason if that these rabbies can render a right one why the saints that walk and live in and after the same holy spirit now that leads into all truth and no transgression and witness the same freedome from the law of sin thereby should for making the same confession to the glory of gods grace be so ill used as i.o would have them as impudent boasters any more then them of old

what ever the qua do and are who by the grace of god being what they are glory in nothing of their own knowing they have nothing but what they have received
shall here clear many clergy men more then any men unless some lawyers be as clear as them from that so punishable crime of glorying and boasting in being free from the least sin or from those grosser evils either for as if they should be found glorying in from either they would be found lyars one way more then now they are so in truth both those kinds of wicked hypocritical deceitful lyars mean in plain terms many priests and some lawyers who can neither of them live on poor mens labours as many of them do in all lands any longer then while men lye dead in their trespasses and sins are for ought find so far from glorying in their immunity from those and all other iniquities that like those old christian enemies to the cross of christ phil


whose end is destruction whose god is their belly who mind earthly things and whose glory is in their shame they glory yet in that immunity and freedome they can get from the powers that are intoxicated with the wine of the wrath of their fornications to commit all evil and so continue in those lyes deceits frauds cheats hypocrisies bloody persecutions spoilings of mens goods devouring widows houses for tythes and for a pretence making long prayers and much more wickedness and prophaneness which from these law and gospel spoilers is long since gone forth into all lands

by that little cloud then which appears dropping from i.os pen though no bigger then a mans hand we can see his complexion and what muddy stuff was working what bloody storms of persecution were brewing in i.os mind against that more tender and true tenet of perfect purging from sin in this life and the innocent asserters of it and so shall take him till he either takes in again that terrible tale of his or at least till he tells the world that it repents him that ere he told it for a joynt antagonist to the together with t.d in that point
nevertheless t.d being the only man that mannages that matter more at large on behalf of himself and many others shall without more ado let this short return stand as to i.os brief opposition of us in this point of perfection and the rather sith believe it will be long enough ere it return from him to us again

with any solid or satisfactory answer and address my self to deal more yet no otherwise then uprightly neither with t.ds writing with whom together with and a.p also once have had to do about it by word of mouth

the second quest
between him and the qua as himself relates both it and what little he thought fit which is scarce one word to his ten in such manner also as might best serve his turn to set down of our discourse with him about it pamp was this whether in this life the saints attain to a state of perfection or freedome from sin which we as to the possibility thereof viz that they may and also as to the necessity that they must be purged from sin in this life or no where there being no purgatory in the world to come holding in the affirmative t.d brings in himself replying thus t.d
your doctrine of perfection is against the tenor of the scripture let us hear what you can say for the proof of it and to urging ioh
whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin
t.d replyes thus viz t.d that cannot be meant of freedome from sin but either there is an emphasis in the word sin intending under that general one kind or sort of sin which is spoken of john
there is a sin unto death or if not in the substantive on the verb poiei which notes to make a trade of business of sin as tis explain'd ver

where he uses the same verb for the devil sinneth from the beginning he hath never ceased to sin since he began thus indeed the saints sin not but a course of sin is broken off and there is not such a free trade between the soul and sin as in the state of unregeneracy whereof this is given for one character that cannot cease to sin pet


rep
here thou art in thy old wonted way of scruing the scripture besides the proper import and ordinary literal sense of the words and true mind of the spirit in them into thy own perverse mind and meaning why cannot that be meant of freedome from sin but that men who are not fully willing to be freed from it and are in love with it and being loath to leave it are loath to see it its more hard not to see then it is to see that it is meant of freedome from sin what should or can it be meant of else are not freed me from sin and not committing of sin made synominous as committing sin and not being freed from it are made by christ himself opposites to each other ioh




the iews thought they had the fullest freedome that men could have in this world because they were the visible church abrahams seed and such like externals as they then trusted in as ye now do though not yet freed from that thing call'd sinning to serve the lord alone whose service the very it self was wont to call perfect freedome but christ learns them another lesson viz that they had none of that true gospel freedome that the saving knowledge of the truth gives and which he makes such as continue in his words and so are his disciples indeed and not in word only as ye are free withall which is a full freedome in deed and truth and not half a one or by the halves such as that is ye talk of who upon the account of some private patent alias particular personal election thereto from everlasting prattle to your selves of freedome from guilt while ye remain in your filth and of a general iustification pardon for all sins past present

and to come in this world expecting your purging or iustification as to sanctification from sin and not in this world but that to come but verily verily say unto you quoth he he that committeth sin is yet the servant of sin and must know for all his boasting he has not long to abide in the house and church of god wherein he scoffs at the right heir isaac as if himself alone who is but a bastard born of fornication should inherit all and will prove an himself at last before the son who is born of god and free indeed and the only true heir of all things full freedome from sin and committing of it are oppos'd to each other by christ therefore freedome from it and not committing it are the same

to wind out of this t.d would seem to say somewhat but of two things he can't tell which but one of the two must be it rather then the truth either there is quoth he an emphasis in the word sin intending under that general term one kind of sin viz sin unto death or if not in the substantive on the verb poiei which notes to make a trade or business of sin as the devil does who sinneth from the beginning and never ceased from sin since he began thus indeed the saints sin not rep as to they emphases they are the foolish empty conceits of thy own and other mens brains theres no such emphasis either in the substantive or verb as ye all prate whereby the spirit should be understood as speaking otherwise then he truly means or meaning otherwise then he plainly sayes whose words are plain to the honest heart though not to idol shepherd who by the sword of the lord hath his right eye utterly darkned because he hath darkned the lords counsel by his own words without knowledge and if the eyes of the seers were not shut up from seeing the very letter they prate about as well the mysteries of the spirit which the animal man can never know by all his searchings they being revealed only by the spirit they might see that the text it self makes no difference between sinning and committing sin and that the one is no more emphatical then the other and if t.d who in the same page
where he mentions the words were not so busie in his mind about the meaning and did not make such a warbling noyse as shallow waters ever do more then those that are deepest with harping at this that and other silly sense he might in coolness have considered that in the same ninth verse as well as the eigth and others about it the spirit makes no difference between amartian poiein and amortanein to commit sin and to sin but uses them promiscuously
ouk amartanei every one that abides in him sinneth not

so ver
he that commits sin is of the devil for the devil amartanei sinneth from the beginning and because t.d seems to put an emphasis upon the word sinneth as well as committeth sin making the word sinneth as here used to amount to somewhat more then an ordinary sort of sinning as here it intends some high or desperate degree of sin even that which ioh
is call'd kat exoken a sin unto death without remedy or forgiveness for ever because never to be repented of as in opposition to all other sins that men do commit which when this alone being ever with impenitency is impardonable are all upon that true repentance they are yet in possibility of who commit them or

possible to be forgiven for this is ds emphasis on the substantive sin for shall not wrong him so much as to take him meaning as the papists do who put such difference between peccatum veniale and mortale as if some sins only without repentance were mortal or to death and some venial or not to death though not repented of at all your church of england opposing them in this and holding every sin yea the least unrepented of unto death though would have suspected me to be a iesuite for a less matter this concludes him that is born of god to be even qua sic as born of god as easily liable to and excludes him no more then it does the very wicked themselves from the committing of any sin that the wickedest can commit except that ye call the sin against the holy ghost it self which is so gross an absurdity that he can be no spiritually wise man that does not feel him to be spiritually infatuated that so imagines for still though the devil sinneth and he that is of the devil doth nothing else but nicodemus though a master in israel can't read this birth of god which is anothen from above of water and the spirit john john
which blows where it lists and the priests hear an outward sound thereof but know not whence it comes nor whether it goes nor how he is that is born of the spirit as plain as tis in the text which they read more then that truth tells of yet as he that sinneth is of the devil and he that is of the devil sinneth altogether so he that sinneth not but doth righteousness only is of god and he that is born of god and the spirit which is spirit and not flesh sinneth not at all but overcometh the world and keepeth himself that the wicked one so much as toucheth him not john
neither can he sin even eatenus because born of god whose own seed or incorruptible word pet

which condemns all and consents to no sin remaineth in him

yet lest it hold not this way t.d puts another string to his devils bow and shoots out another sense as emphatically as he can with all his might by which notwithstanding as he did in the other three questions above spoken to he hath utterly lost the game and given the whole cause and this question contended for so clearly if there should be no more shooting about it that by all his scrambling shifts whereby he scrabbles and scraffies to gather it up again he will never recover of the wound that he hath unawares given to himself for mark how his own emphasis on the verb poiei undoes him it notes quoth he to make a trade or business of sin as the devil does who never ceased to sin thus indeed the saints sin not but a course of sin is broken off and there is not such a free trade between the soul and sin as in the state of unregeneracy whereof this is given for one character that cannot cease from sin pet


rep
to say nothing here how that parish priests do make a trade and business of sin of preaching for hire persecuting for tythe promoting the popes pay and parish posture since they were sworn to endeavour the extirpation of all popery looking every one for his gain from his quarter which themselves and states them still in unregeueracy if t.ds words be true as its sure enough they are when he sayes thus indeed the saints do not sin this is in the state of unregeneracy whereof this is one character they cannot cease from sin for howbeit they have long since well

nigh left off to do good yet these and many more evils they abhor not nor have so much as ceased from to this day

but to let pass that observe secondly how t.d distinguishes the saints from the devil and the unregenerate ones that are yet born of him by this character which is the true one of ceasing and not ceasing from sin the devil quoth he and the unregenerate they make a free trade and business of sin and never cease to sin true enough but thus the saints sin not but the course of sin which the other keep is broken off so that theres not this free trade between sin and their souls as is among others who do hoc agere sin and cease not from it but the saints they cease from it
rep more truth then t.d was well aware of when he told it even so much and no less and no more do we need from him then whereby he has as fully yielded us our question as have shewed he hath done all the rest we had to do with him about excepting that of the infallibility of the gospel ministry affirmed by us which yet he hath also yielded so far to towards the truth of as will force him to give us all that too at last sith he hath confessed the meer fallibility of their own the ignorance of which do not much marvel that he confesses since he charges christ himself with such ignorance and fallibility as whereby unawares to himself and not knowing that he was such a one he ose a devil to be his minister

pamp which devil yet say we to wit iudas though he prov'd so at last by transgression falling back from that true apostleship he once obtain'd act

was not known to be so because saving ds groapable darkness he was not so from the beginning nor when christ chose him but one of the twelve that had the spirit as the other eleven had matth

and when he fell into the deceit and so became diabolos alias one that acts by deceit and abode not in the truth before ever there was any appearance of it to the disciples christ was not so ignorant of it but that he knew it as well as iudas did himself
but as to the questiou again which is whether in this life the saints may attain to such a state of freedome from sin as not to sin but to cease from it and live without it t.d sayes nay we say yea who shall be judge what witness have we to our assertion let that of god in all consciences judge and let t.ds
witness be taken for us against himself yea what need we further witness ye your selves all people that can read may read it under his own hand in his answer to us viz
that whereas the devil and his children sin and whilst his cease not from it any more then their father who begets them to it the saints do not sin thus but by this character are to be known from the sinners who cease not from it viz in that the saints cease from sin which is indeed the very thing required to be ceased from therefore possible to be done by all them that have that mind of christ cor
phil

pet

even by the power whereby it was done in himself for as much as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh your selves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from
thus t.d suo se gla hath laid his a bleeding and wounded it to death with his own wea

yet least t.d should begin to pick up his crums and fight us again such foolish fragments as these viz that though the saints do sometimes cease from sin are not always sinning yet they may sin again and fall into soul enormities which what ere they are our sinner like saints use to call but infirmities when a professor commits them as david did through weaknesse

rep
this is not to the question which as t.d undertakes it against us is not whether those men call'd saints cannot sin any more or not after once they come upon a true account under that domination of saints but whether such a state as to cease from sinning be attainable in this life yea or nay as to the other we know well enough what to say of it as occasion is but as for this about which sub judice lis est t.d hath consented to us in it and we shall take him at his word
and for as much as t.d here so plainly asserts it that the saints do at least sometimes cease from sin are not alwayes sinning but have the course of it which the wicked keep on in broken off this minds me of another contradiction and crosse whet which he gives to himselfe out hf his crosse bow for how is this consistent with his reply to
of his
pamp where to ds absur'd positions viz that a believers person with his works are accepted with god though his works be not perfect answering thus viz here he would have believers like the priests who sin in the best of their performances as they confesse but say the believers workes are wrought in god and these works of god are perfect as for our confession quoth tis agreeable to scripture there's not a man on earth that doth good and sinneth not eccles

i.e
that sinneth not in doing good inquity of holy things is spoken of exod
duties which are holy for the matter are for the manner of performance
rep by which it seemes t.d judges there is such a continuall course of sinning in the saints as that they cannot cease from it at all for if while they are doing good and performing duty they are sinning and doing iniquity then how much more while they are doing materiall evill and iniquity it self and so consequently cease not from it at all which if they do not then how do they cease as t.d sayes they do heres another stabb with his own which t.d gives himself whose words are such swords to himself and agree well together by the eares among themselves that a man need but bring them out upon the open stage where such as are minded to behold the battell may see them falling out and fencing against each other and killing both their master and one another

and now have that passage upon this occasion under hand one word more to it it passe for tis not worth returning to it again if a believers works which as truly said are wrought in god and say by god in them himselfe from isa
dares not deny it any more then do deny that all righteousnesse wrought of himselfe before and out of faith in the light are dung unclean things and filthy rags from isa
phil

if say a believers be not perfect and his doing good be sin and his duties iniquity let me ask thee t.d doth god who works the believers works in them work works that are not perfect but imperfect and if thou say what he works at first in believers

is but in part of what he will do from cor
now we know in part

rep remember what told thee above that in part is one thing and imperfect is another grace holinesse in part is a perfect gift dram of it as well as the highest degree of it though tis not so much in measure as every spark of fire is perfect fire though not so great a fire as the flame it comes from
but what do talking of not thou countest the best performances of the best saints evill sin iniquity does god then who works all his saints works in and for them absit blasphemia work evill sin and ini quity thou sayst though a believers works are not perfect but the best of them sin and iniquity yet god accepts both believers and their works hath iniquity then acceptance with god tis more then can yet receive for truth unlesse thou scratch and scrape out of the scripture such texts as tell us he hath no pleasure in it know he taketh pleasure in his saints psal
but that shewes that such as you who take pleasure in pleading for are none of the saints what ere ye call your selves that he take pleasure in
ye use to say to god in your prayers
lord art of purer eyes then to behold the least iniquity without it and the subiects of it and such like yet to go round again behold t.d sayes believers works are sin iniquity and yet god takes pleasure in or accepts the believer and his works
finally know so much of such saints as your selves are isa to
that tis iniquity even your meetings and appointed fasts and feasts but god takes no pleasure in them yea his hates loathes and detests them
but he hath a people and a sort of saints ye know not whose solemn meetings and are as incense before him who are not sinners as ye confesse ye are in all they do nor are their duties and doings of good by his power sin evill and iniquity and these and their services while ye and all yours are a smoak and stink in his nose are a sweet smelling savour to in all the good they do


as to a mans falling into sin again after he hath once ceased from it know no necessity of that which is the matter ye have to prove or else ye prove nothing at all to your own purpose who hold that men must needs sin while they are in the body and cannot possibly do otherwise but know a necessity let men sin as often and as long as they will of ceasing to and of leaving it off before they leave the body otherwise if they dy not to it but but live in it till they dy and dy in it as christ threatned the pharisees they should do twere good for them had they never been born there being no place for repentance from or purgation from it after death and notwithstanding your pretended necessity of mens sinning while they breath bodily here on earth yet know not only a necessity as aforesaid unless they mean the tree lying as it falls as ye use to preach and the eternall judgement finding all men as death leaves them to be remedilessly miserable for ever but a possibility also by the grace vouchsafed if themselves be not wanting in its improvement of ceasing finally from sinning

while in the body nor sith confesses the saints do cease from sin and its continued is broken off in them can any man tell me why should be less possibility of ceasing from sin or more necessity of sinning to morrow then to day or next day then to morrow and from that time of a mans first abstaining from what evil the light in his conscience convinces him of and condemns him for and so successively onward to his lives end the same power that kept him to day being as able as he keeps to it though the temptation daily comes to keep him from the transgression to morrow and the next day and even for ever and who can tell me why he that withstood one temptation to any transgression by the light and power of god may not as well if in his will he turn not from the same power which is alwayes nigh and ready to keep him withstand another and another and so all so as to escape the transgression and why he that was not drunk nor lewd nor proud nor nor nor unrighteous nor deceitful nor abominable nor disorderly to day must needs be so another time his being subject to passions pollutions extravagancies vanities inordinancies of mind is but an argument to evince how much the more need he hath at all times to stand upon his guard and to put on the armour of the light and keep the stricter watch to it which who so does shall find the power of it in him prevailing more and more in the warfare to the perfect overcoming and the bringing of iudgement in him unto victory at the last but who so does not while he stands take heed to his way by it as young men are bid in order to the cleansing of their way psa there is not confess more necessity nor possibility of the others standing then there is of this mans falling into mischief

howbeit which way soever the man in medio is swayed whether by the lustings of the flesh to covetousness pride envy hatred deceit unrighteousness lasciviousness revenge to mind and walk after the flesh or by the lustings of the spirit to love peace purity meekness temperance patience or which way soever that man is born and begotten whether by the spirit of god from above or the spirit of the devil from beneath which in him lusteth unto evil

and consequently whose child soever he is at any time of the twain which is according to the prevalency and predominancy and perminency of this or that seed in him viz the seed or word of god or that lying word or seed of the serpent for his he is still to whom obeyes yet this is sure enough as said before that he that abides in that which is of god sinneth not ioh
and he that sinneth is gone from that and born and begotten by the devil another way even after his image and he that is so is of the devil and a man of sin and sinneth uncessantly as his father doth who hath begot him into his likeness and he that doth true righteousness is born of god to it and he that's born of god and bears his image which longer then any man doth he is not of god sinneth not the world keepeth himself that the wicked one toucheth not neither can he sin while so because he is born of god and the seed of god remaineth is head permanent prevalent and preheminent in him and so which of these two sorts men are matters not much to the point sinners as such are sinners ever and not saints and saints are saints ever as such and not sinners

and each hath his reward from god as his work is and he that's holy is hely and he that's righteous is righteous and he that's unjust unjust still and he that's wicked is wicked still and he that's good is good and not evil and he that's evil is evil and not good and the godly are they that are godly and none else and the ungodly are ungodly and nothing else that's opposite to it for contraries cannot be denominated both of the same subject at the same time and each of these as they are reapse in very deed so are they in gods account who accounts all men and things truly what they are and not as man who wearies the lord with his words saying every one that do evil is good in the sight of the lord and god delighteth in him and who is abuniration with the lord for
mal
calling good evil evil good nor justifying the wicked or condemning the righteous but in his righteous judgement which evil men understand not pro

as it is revealed in the light which is the day thereof rendring to all according to their deeds secret as well as open by christ iesus according to the gospel paul preached to the patient continues in well doing eternal life to the contentious ones against the truth that obey not it but unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish and this to every soul of man that doth evil iew or gentile rom
and so only that doth righteousness is righteous and is of god and accepted with him and he that doth not righteousness is not of god nor he that hateth his brother hath no eternal life from god abiding in him and be that sinneth is of the devil and hereby the children of god are manifested and the children of the devil and each hath his own fathers portion as he bears his image nature and proportion and as no righteous one is rejected or reprobated so no unrighteous one is elected or accepted but without respect of persons in every nation he that fears god and works righteousness in christ the light is accepted with him

and howbeit the righteous turning from his righteousness to iniquity may die as the wicked turning from his wickedness to that which is lawful and right may live and the same person may turn and return and turn again and be in possibilities of life or death according as he chuses when both are him yet the wayes of god are equal and his iudgements according to truth and each man from him for ever as he doth and though the man that is now a sinner may become a saint like david and a sinner again and by true repentance and purging with hysop a saint again yet the saint hath no part with the sinner in his lake nor the sinner any share in the inheritance of the saints which is in light but each hath his own peculiar and proper reward and the heart of the one knows his own heaviness and the stranger intermeddles not with the others joy

and howbeit men may of unbelievers become believers and believers in the light may by an evil heart of unbelief draw back to perdition and depart from the living god yet whether they believe or not god abideth faithful and cannot deny himself the believers portion that believes is the life and the unbelievers part is the lake and though he that is now an unbeliever side may become a believer and be saved and he that now believes making shipwrack of his faith and good conscience as iudas and others did may come to be damned yet no believer is ever damned

nor is any unbeliever ever saved but the foundation of the lord who knows his own evermore stands ever sure let men go which way they will who owns none that name the name of christ and depart not from iniquity and owns all who ere they be that do according to his everlasting and unchangeable decree that stands thus stedfast without variation for ever viz that he that believes only shall be saved and he that believes not shall be damned mar

so then every saint ceases from sin as t.d also saves and he that ceases not from it is no saint or holy one but a sinner and the sinner cannot but sin and do as his father the devil who begets him does and he that's a saint is born of god and that's ban of god doth not neither can because so and though there be among the sons of god degrees of growth in grace and faith as to the measure of it as said degrees among believers for which sillily suppos'd meant that some of these have a mixture of sin with their grace page
pamp
yet deny any mixture of sin and grace together which they are no more capable of then water and oyl but every believer and babe as so that is truly born of god is perfect after christs own image and in the divine nature though not yet grown up into the measure and fulness of christs stature and stands justified and accepted in the sight of god and out of the condemnation while out of the transgression and every unbeliever in the light is out of god and christ who are light is in the darkness and of the devil the prince of darkness and is in the condemnation because in the transgression and one with that seed which is in the reprobation and each seed and the son that respectively is born of it hath its own proper portion divided out unto it and that which is of the spirit hath life together with it and who is of the serpent and the sows to it and if not parted from it must perish together with it and accordingly reap nothing but corruption
and as to all the rest of ds to our reasons rendred as to this point at the dispute at sandwich which replyes of his having no more force of reason in them then there is strength in a rush as to their reaching to hurt the truth though need not take any notice of them in order to the consuting of t.d he having so fairly consured himself already as is above shewed yet for the sakes of such as are honest hearted and willing to see the truth may run over to the rest in such wise as follows
next then in answer to who told him truly how he wrested the scriptures to his own destruction for so by his emphases he does indeed t.d sayes quoth he the agrees to all the saints and if it excludes the being of sin here he goes off from the terms for he should have said the sinning acting or assenting to sin in some it must in all for the seed remains in all as well as any
rep say so too and therefore for the reason is sufficiently rendred above it is that no saint that's born of god as so doth sin or can while such if he do he is no saint tis the sinner and not the saint that sins which is begotten back by the devil from that of god into his own image likeness and nature and by the serpent beguiled again as paul was jealous the corinthians would be and as the galatians were bewitched form the obedience of the truth

but now quoth least ye should be so mad as to assert all saints to be free from sin from sinning still he should say for sin may be dead in a man who sins not nor lives in it pray read joh if we say that we have no sin we deceive our selves and this is spoken of such persons as of whom it is denyed that they commit sin persons that had fellowship with the father and his son iesus christ

rep here he hath brought more fuel for that fire that is already burning his drossy divinations the foolish woman can do no other in the day thats approaching but pull down her own house with her own hands and so doth folly befool the divine doers against the truth in these dayes into an utter undoing of themselves
is spoken of such quoth he of whom its said they commit not sin so say and of such of whom its said they sin not
therefore t.d may be sure he can fetch nothing hence in proof of it that they do sin
its said of such quoth he as had fellowship with the father and son so say which proves them not now to be sinners but must necessarily prove them and so indeed it does to be free from sin and the deeds of darkness not sinning not walking in the darkess or any deeds of it but in the light now at least what ere the had done in which light who walkes as it leades him cannot sin any more then he can that walkes not after the but after the spirit and is led not by the flesh but by the spirit which light and spirit never led any yet into sin so the very text and his own brings to conclude them sinners excludes them utterly from being sinners now for had they been so they could not have had that fellowship with god and christ which said they now had for god is light in him is no darknesse at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darknesse we ly and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light then have we fellowship and the blood of christ cleanseth us from all sin if we say we have no sin we deceive our selves and the truth is not in us but if we confesse our sins he faithfull and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a lyar who but such night owls as can see better by night then they can by day can pick out such a thing as this from any one of these verses viz that iohn and the saints he here writes to even of the least growth and lowest measure however they had been so did sin and were sinners at this when he wrote it that they all had sin once and had sinned its evident enough as told then for if we say we have not sinned saith he we make god a lyar yea had they never sinned they had needed neither that pardon nor purging and perfect cleansing from all sin all unrighteousness he there affirms they confessing their sins god was faithfull to give them as well as to forgive all what they had committed and which they then witnessed in praesenti but that at this time they were sinning and sinners not one title in all that text doth testifie

but yea must not think to us quoth
tis amartian ouk echomen and the other is ouk emartekamen suppose the latter verse to be understood of the sins which praeceded the new birth yet the former is expressely de presenti that we have not have had no sin

rep who doubts of this but that is the present tense we know iohn saves if we say that we have no sin we deceive our selves

but what then my friend because he sayes it in presenti will it follow that they were sinners in presenti contrarium
for as its most evident that the
is explanatory and expositive of the to him that well heeds the
that comes between them so if he had not in one of them given out his own mind and meaning not thine about the other yet all that's spoken in presenti is not as thou judgest spoken de praesenti but not a little of the same nature with this is by the utter'd in praesenti in the present time and that relates not ad praesens but ad to the time past onely as uttered concerning that iam
he sayes of the tongue its an unruly evill full of deadly poison and in praesenti therewith blesse we god therewith curse we men made after gods image alias saints will any man be so simple as to conclude from hence that iames and the saints were now at this time csers of men or of saints that bare gods image or that he wrote this of himself and them de praesenti as concerning this present time wherein he writes it and not rather understand him as speaking of man as he is in the fall unrenewed in statu corrupto immorigero inconverso of men yet unconverted to the truth which teacheth better fruits then such bitter as these which yet for all your blessing god with the same mouth ye national ministers are found bringing forth at this day does he not speake it of men as they ly dead in trespasses and sins and so consequently of himself and the saints as de praeterito concerning the time past who in times past had their conversation among such as paul sayes eph tit

so rom paul sayes in praesenti am carnall under sin find a law in my members carrying me captive into the law of sin and much more then that in the present tense through that chapter is any man but he whose own wisdome is all foolishnesse for want of heeding the measure of the light and gods in his own heart so foolish at to interpret paul as speaking of himself and his present state in those words and so as to conclude that paul while he in the spirit of god wrote that epistle to the romans was carnall under sin enslaved to it carried captive by it led at the will of sin and satan as he had once been before the light or law in the spirit and he came together at which time began the war before which war as he was in his contracted corrupt nature howere he thought not so till the light shew'd it him sin was alive in him and he dead in it and a servant to it under which war also if he kept not to his watch he might loose ground sometimes and gain it again as he recover'd to his watch to the light and stood arrayed with the armour thereof in which continuing stedfast at last he obtained the victory of which he speakes in the same place ch
so that at praesent he witnessed the law of the spirit of life in christ the light which warr'd in his mind against the law of his members had now made him free from that law of sin and death which once he was so pester'd with that he cryed out of himselfe as wretched by reason of it and witnessed also the son of god condemning sin so perfectly in his by christs power in him that the righteousnesse of the law was now fulfilled

in himselfe and other saints and himselfe walking not after the flesh but after the spirit

say can any think paul such a one but such as sell themselves to folly not considering that paul speaks of three states he had experienced one before the law or light when he lay dead in sin a under it while he warred against it a in christ wherein he stood freed from and in full dominion over it but one of which he could possibly be in at once and at this time and that was the having passed the other two as is evident ch
hath made me free can any but benighted ones that being sold under sin themselves measure others by themselves judge paul to be the premises cosidered under the power of sin and unfreed from it at this present and that he wrote of himself as wretched de presenti because he wrote it in praesenti thus and thus am had he not then subjected himselfe below the saints he writes to of whom he sayes chap
that even they were made free from sin as well he who were once the servants of it and yielded their members up to obey it as he was and did of which persons yet in the name of rumsey simply says
pamp
it cannot be meant simply that they were freed from sin because paul
sayes not so much by way of condemnation say as by way of caution to them that they should not judge and set naught one another for why dost thou there may be by way of memorandum and warning as well christs how wilt thou and why beholdest thou thou hypocrite to his own disciples math

and as pauls other why thou cor which was not by way of downright charge and censure but by way of prevention of such things as should not be and hint how it ought to be among them but undoubtedly paul
rom
speakes as concerning how it was with him in times past when he lay under sin and while he passed throw his warfare against it being at present in the state of victory over it which state of victory the scripture every where speaks of as that the saints come to here even to the overcoming of the world and the lust of it while they live in it ioh
rev
rev
which our priests put far from themselvs and their people as a state attainable onely in the world to come
yea oh the blindnesse that
of the rom for want of heeding the
together with it is made the common place of our blind guides and fathers from whence upon the account of pauls wretched man that am to nourish up their sinning saints from fainting under the burden of their necessary infirmityes and from whence to conclude paul to have liv'd and dyed also without full freedom and perfect purging from his sins and themselves much more to be under a necessity of sinning and living casually while they live

which yet follows no more then it did from that of iames above from both which it will follow as fully as from that of iohn am yet in hand with and that is indeed not one jot at all if we say we have no sin who that hath sinned can say he hath no sin for the sin he hath once committed he hath and the sins by which iohn and they had sinned of old were theirs or else they needed no saviour nor purging as cursing men possibly might be sins of which iames and them he writes to could not say we have no such for such and such were some of you saith paul to the

saints cor
but now ye are washed sanctified justified by the spirit
so that if we confesse he is faithfull and just to forgive and thats not all though the priest stops there but to cleanse us from all unrighteousnesse yea the blood of iesus his son doth in praesenti cleanse us from all sin if then there be any filth remaining theres not a cleansing from all but if as the text sayes it was to some it be from all then theres none at all remaining so as to be committed or acted to defilement though the saints may be said to have it in and about them so as to be tempted to it while it is fully under them yet temptation to it is not transgression and the same may be said of cor
let us cleanse though paul himself was cleansed from all uncleannesse of flesh and spirit then which know no more holinesse in the fear of god who say commands not impossibilities to the visible churches in which sundry were who were not clean as christs saints and true disciples are through the word he speakes to them nor cleansing but some waxing worse and worse ioh
phil

much lesse doth christ command no to his true ministers as fast as false ones hasten to that fruitlesse work if there own doctrine were true in his name to command what is impossible yet even to the little children in the church does iohn write that they sin not ioh
as well as of the young men in commendation that they are strong and have overcome the wicked one and yet there are fathers beyond all these

next to mentioning phil

as many as be perfect in proof of perfection here replyes a whole page full of worth nothing which is scarce worth noting on any other account then to shew how tis worse then nothing to his own purpose

tells us that's spoken of grown christians that were perfect in comparison of babes
rep that every babe in christ is perfect as to the divine nature which assents to no sin much lesse acts it
have shew'd above but if all that are born of god were not perfect yet that some are there confesses and if but one it proves the possibility of it which we plead against him and he pleads against

he tells us that perfect in scripture is put for upright and these are made synonimous and of the same import

rep true perfect and upright are one and both import no lesse then a man that sins not eccles

adam in innocency was perfect it's said god made man upright for while any are upright they are answerable to the law or light lent them to live by which sin is the transgression of and so no transgressours and while they transgresse that law they are not perfect nor upright but crooked and so accounted
whether it be iob himself whom so much instances in and insists on

pamp and

pamp or david himselfe or any other therefore while david stood in integrity and uprightnesse as mostly he did it preserved him and god so accounted him and justified him as an upright man as he did iob
in the same case but where he turn'd aside into the deceit defilement god held him not upright but hypocriticall false filthy and sinfull much lesse did he therein hold him guiltlesse and justifie him as most ignorantly delivers it that he did

pamp even when he was guilty of adultery

and murder in which juncture nevertheless t.d sayes he was not in a condemned state but in a justified estate the scripture exempts him from justification so far that it vouchsafes him not that denomination of an upright man in that matter of vriab but brands him with the name of a pittylesse blood guilty man a secret evill doer in the sight of the lord a despiser of him and his comandement and a causer of gods enemies to blaspheme his name psal
sam

howbeit this one thing by the way is worth noting concerning not for any good that is in it or in as touching his demeanour in it that when he speaks of the saints good and duty that they do he says that's not perfect but an unclean thing dung and filthy rags yea that he calls sin and iniquity

pamp
they sin quoth he in doing good duties holy for the matter are iniquity for the manner performance but when the saints as in davids commit adultery and murder he pronounces them blessed as having no guile nor guilt in their spirit but sincere which is the same with upright or perfect see

pamp
david quoth he psal
pronounces the man blessed which hath no guile in his spirit or sincere which himselfe was at that time though under the guilt of a great sin
which is by interpreters supposed to be the same sins for which psal
was composed

rep heres doctrine of divinity with a witnesse when the saints do the best good they sin their holy things are all as an unclean thing their righteousness is dung filthy rags though holds also that paul had no righteousness which was not christs

pamp nor any righteousnesse but what from christ he received their performing duty at least is no lesse then iniquity but when they are under the guilt of such great sins as adultery and murder oh blessed men they at that time have no guile in their spirits are in sincerity or to speakin the diminutive phrase by which sometimes he lessens the foul faults and great sins of the saints at the worst but under infirmity but be it this or be it that greater or lesse better or se infirmity or iniquity good or evill duty or dung righteousness or rags holy or unclean the upshot of all is this the men are blessed men what ere they do they are never in a condemned but ever in a justified estate and let their works be as they will perfect or not perfect good or duty which they call unclean dung iniquity or filthy rags their persons though thus sinning are ever saints and believers which together with their works are accepted with god who yet say never accepted any such works as are iniquity and sin nor any persons while they are the workers of them
and as to the remnant of d's talk in answer to which is to this purpose viz that paul phil

denyes any such perfection as is exclusive of sin till that last and bodily resurrection from the dead which he looks not for in this life which answer he is so in love with that he hath it in his pamp
and also ore again in his pamp

rep shall answer that no other wise then out of d's
own mouth who as am as to my self credibly enough inform'd by a in a meeting among many at sandwich since those publike disputes we had since the edition of both his books being the precise time wherein perfect purging is answered when the soul being passed out of the body is in its passage between here and heaven or to that purpose which is but so and no somer

must then be before the resurrection he talks of and if he will not be convinced by his own words that sin is excluded before the resurrection much lesse is it likely he should believe any of mine
adding this however viz
that if ye lye down in your graves with your bones full of sin ye shall rise with them full of sorrow was wont to be the priests argument to the people to perswade them to a purging from all sin before they dye because no purging to be lookt after death much lesse so long of after as at the resurrection
verbum sat sapienti

the next answer of t.d is to the argument urged from psal
which he who renders all we said as weakly lamely and decrepidly as he can for his own ends repeats not half so much as by the halves for wisht him him to heed all the
verses which were then peraphras'd to him and argued fm in such wise as followeth viz they that are undefiled in the way are not defiled in the way they that walk in the law of the lord do not transgresse it they that keep his testimonies do not break them they that seek him with their whole heart serve him not by the halves not him and sin but him alone and wholly they that done iniquity do not sin they that walk in his way do not walk besides it but there were some or else they could not be pronounced blessed for the spirit blesses not such men as are not and such now may be for quod fieri potuir potest what was then is possible to be now who are undefiled in the way walk in the law of the lord that keep his testimonies and seek him with their whole heart who do no iniquity and walk in his way therefore tis possible that the saints may be freed from sinning in this life the summe of what replyes to all this is that the phrases are hyperbolicall which is a little better at least but how much list not here to tell then if t.d had said they are hypocriticall or as his wonted replyes are when he can find no better as have shewed above the meaning of the words cannot be as the letter of them doth import the spirit meanes not as he sayes the spirits meaning may be mistaken when his words are taken in the most ordinary liter all sense and so it would be if undefiled and doing no iniquity should be meant truely of being undefiled and doing none iniquity indeed

pamp
its meant of having respect to all gods commandements in respect of design and endeavour though falling short in accomplishment
being explanatory of the other

rep oh the impudency of this man what have we for all this he sayes against the plain literall sense of the spirits words whereby to assure us that the spirit means not as his own words import but onely in that shambling sense which shuffles them into whose words must be taken d's
or davids and the spirits the very literall sense of which is exclusive of all sin and defilement and strictly expressive of doing no iniquity at all who that is born of god doth not see to be a strict pleader for loosenesse and endeavourer to uphold the kingdom the spirit pronounces them blessed and no more in whose whose spirit there is no guilt that do no iniquity walk in in gods way and keep his testimonies or commandements will bring in a bastard brood into this blessednesse that short in the accomplishment of this that must be supposed at least to be ever respecting designing and endeavouring to do that businesse which yet notwithstanding all their respects designes

and endeavours they are to believe they must never do it being not possible to be done they must alwayes dwell at the sign of the labour in vain and be striving to wash the white and alwayes roling sysiphus's stone ever purifying never pure ever mortifying their earthly members fornication uncleannesse inordinate affection to the world evill concupiscence covetousnesse idolatry anger wrath lying filthy communication but never while they live obtain to witnesse these so mortifyed as to be no more committed least such an absurdity as this should follow that the scripture which confesse is found contradicting these on it be found contradictory to it self for quoth
pamp all the scriptures which require repentance and mortification during this life do deny the possibility of perfection for they and it are incompatible
we are bid quoth he to mortify our earthly members inordinate desires motions and actions of corrupt

that is constantly endeavour to represse and subdue them
and theres no reason but that gods commands should run in that old stile though we are not able to fulfill them

rep of all the peices of proof against the possibility of perfection that ever heard made by himself or any other this is the most monstrously rediculous draw this rude and crude matter into its own form and the force of it runs ihus
that which god requires and commands us to be alwayes doing and constantly endeavouring to do during this life can never possibly be done or effected during this life for if it be once fully done effected and accomplished then we can't be alwayes doing it and so not obey what god requires
but god requires we should be alwayes mortifying constantly endeavouring to represse and subdue the actions of corrupt nature during this life therefore its impossible unlesse we be left uncapable of doing what god requires that we should in this life perfectly mortify and subdue them
in short that which must be ever in fieri while we live can't be in facto esse till we dy but we are in fieri to be alwayes purifying our selves while we live therefore least there be no more work of that kind for us to do we may not lawfully or cannot possibly be pure till we ay rep
this is even as a shift as if a debtor promising to owe endeavour to pay his creditor
should never pay it him upon the pretence of an impossibility to perform his promise if he do once pay the mony must ever owe him the and stand engaged to endeavour to pay it therefore unlesse make my selfe uncapable of performing my promise which am alwayes mindfull of performing must never actually pay it

but now as to d's
place who would it seems willingly be alwayes in gods debt during his life but never come out of it till after death ever owing so much love as fulfills the law but never practising it so as to fulfill the law must arrest him for all his shift and deny the minor of his argument

we are not required to be alwayes doing or endeavoring to suppre is and mortify sin so as never to bring the work to accomplishment in th ss life but once to effect it before we dye for as they are blamed that are over learning and never able to come to the knowledg of the truth so are they as little accepted that are allwayes seeking to god dayly in pretence as a nation that had a mind to do righteousness asking of him the ordinances of iustice seeming to take delight in approaching to god that they might know his wayes alwayes when the appointed time comes fasting and praying humbling and afflicting their souls for a day and hanging down their heads as a bullrush thinking that to be a fast of the lords chusing and the acceptable day of the lord yet never loosing the bands of wickednesse nor undoing the heavy burden nor breaking every yoak nor letting the oppressed seed of god in their own hearts nor without neither go free ever and anon fasting for sin never from it ever reforming never reformed ever running never obtaining alwayes making a shew of mortifying sin never making any true effectuall mortification of it ever warring never overcoming nor quenching the fiery darts of the wicked nor dislodging the vain thoughts that are in them nor coming to the end of the commandement which is love from a pure heart good conscience and faith unfamed allwayes beating the aire but never keeping under the body nor bringing it into subjection to the power of truth ever owing that love which works no ill but fulfills the law never performing any thing but that hatred which breaks the law debtors alwayes to the spirit but living after the flesh and never by the spirit mortifying the deeds of the body that they may live to god such sluggardly wishers and wouldens and seekers and respecters and pretenders and striuers and runners fighters reformers and mortifiers will be cast away at length for all their constant endeavours sith they do not so much as look to overtake what they run after nor reach the high prize they professe to presse to in this life which if they do not themselves say also tis to late to effect and obtaine it after death
but

qui cupit optatam cursu contingere metam multa tulit fecitque puer sintavit alsit

tis good for a man to bear christs yoak in his youth sith the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing but the soul of the diligent shall be made far
as for the residue of ds reply to the argument above as some of it has bin toucht on before so what was not is scarce worth mentioning
he tells us
which talks of respect to all gods commands explaines all the other
rep sayes so but wher's his proof beside if it be so a true real respect though such a slender one as he rests in does not stands in a due and true observation of them is he worthy to be respected as a true respecter of gods commandements that breaks them

t.d david excludes himself from the blessed estate if undefiled and doing no iniquity be meant strictly here sith his wish
and other passages shew he was not free from sin which surely david did not intend because psal
he pronounces blessednesse to the man in whose spirit is no guile who is sincere as himself was at that time though then under the guilt as is supposed by

interpreters of his great sin of murder and adultery for which psal
was composed

rep
some of this dirty stuff spoke to but a little before the falsehood of which is evident for whereas the scripture sayes david was not upright in the matter of uriah t.d sayes yea he was sincere and had no guile in his spirit when under the guilt of those great sins

as to the rest what if david did exclude himself if he were under those great evills he might well exclude himself from the blessednesse of sincere ones till he came into the sense of gods love again to repentance while he pronounced the undefiled ones blessed that did no such iniquity he had reason to take the curse as his own portion to himself and to cry out of himself talaiporos anthroyos wretched man that am more deservedly then paul who though in zeal of god shedding blood yet was tis like never such a deep adulterer and deliberate murderer as david was in vriahs case and as god said to israel hos so might david say to himself rejoyce not thou as other honest people for thou gone a who from thy god and if that were his case as thou intimatest it was wherein he was so desperately defiled with filth and blind he might well exclude himself from it having no reason to take to himself the blessing of the undefiled or whether he excluded himself or no from it this am sure for all thy foolish dreams about davids good condition iustification blessednesse and vprightness whilst under the guilt of those sordid iniquities that the scripture excludes him in that case so far from blessednesse that it concludes him neither upright as thou simply dost not so much as a respecter of gods commands which at least thou dorest he was even when he called that all abomination whiles thou judg him as indeed thou doest to have respect to gods commandments that despises both god and him for sam

as much as thou smoothest over those abominable businesses the better to sooth thy self and some sinful saints like thy self in your lusts and iniquities as no more then saints infirmities who have respect to all gods commandemets in respect of design and indeavour though falling short in accomplishing yet when nathan came to him a year after he had lyen in that dirty pickle in impenitency under the guilt of those gross impieties he is so far from sowing pillows and daubing with such untempered morter as thou dost and from including him in the lists of sincerity and owning him as one that had respect to all gods commands that he convinces him of his wicked hypocrisies and condemns him as one that had despised both god himself and his commandements
next as he relates
pamp asking me whether could produce one single example of a perfect saint in our sense told him yea instancing in zachary and elizabeth luke

who were both righteous before god not before man onely but before god walking in all the commandements of god not in some few or many but all and ordinances of god blameless

to this accounting for more then that he then said though tis one to as little purpose as the other first quoth he how appeares it that righteous before god is meant of a perfect inherent righteousnesse seeing a believers

person with his works are accepted with god though his works be not perfect and in proof of this imperfect and crooked conceit of his own he coats heb

by faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice then cain by which he obtain'd witness that he was righteous and then adds that blameless is meant but comparatively as phil

that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in which same sense he sayes luke
understands the phrase to which he adds phil

where paul while a pharisee sayes he was blameles as touching the righteousness of the law which he was onely externally conformable to and how zachariah was at the same time blamed and also punish't for his unbelief

rep in which piece of reply of his something is true but nothing to d's
turn but rather such as serves the truths turn against his but something most abominable confused false and fained viz
that a believers person with his works are accepted with god though his works be not perfect
for how ere d's
calls and counts men as he does dain'd saints and believers while their works are not perfect and not only not perfect but abominable also wicked sinful filthy hypocritical deceitful gross iniquity adultery murther and despite to the commands of god as davids acting in vriahs matter are called psal
sam

guiltless yet no such imperfect evil workers while so are any more deem'd upright by god then david was who was not vouchsafed the name of upright in that case

much lesse are such as are not perfect but evil works such as are at best but unclean dung iniquity and filthy rags yet such and no better does call the duties and as to the manner the best performances of himself and his sort of saints of any acceptance at all as have shewed well nigh newly above but rather an abhorrency in the sight of god by what person soever acted nor was davids adultery with bathsheba and murder of vriah nor himself as acting it nor any service he did or sacrifice he offer'd while under the filth and and unrighteousnesse of it till he had throughly repented of it was wasn't from it and recovered out of it any more accepted as a sweet smelling savour with god then the adultery of another man then cains murder of righteous abel and the persons and performances of all such unrighteous livers whose very sacrifices while they are such god hath no more respect to then he had to that of cain whose seed they are whose image and nature while they are doing so wickedly they all beare and are found in david himself as so doing not excepted which sacrifice of cain though else perhaps as costly as his brothers had together with his person no such acceptance as righteous abel and his had because at that time he was an evil doer and then twas the evil doer that did the good sin lay at the door and kept the sacrifice from acceptance as it ever does where ere it lyes for where and while there is a turning away the care from the law ther's the wicked one there the person and the performance are both a stink before the lord yea the very prayers of the wicked are abominable
and in bringing abel for an instance of a believers person and his works being accepted with god though his works be not perfect he quite cuts the throat of his own cause for both abel

and his works were true and perfect and righteous before god and so they are both cal'd mat

heb

iohn

while cain and his works are both call'd evil and of the devil and therefore had abel and his works acceptance when cain and his had none because he was righteous not so esteemed of god while he was not so indeed as deems who because he so does deems that god as himself deems those and theirs to be good and righteous which in themselves inhaesive are nothing lesse but saving that contrary account supposes god to have thereof really rather evill and unrighteous for had cain bin righteous and done well in other matters he had done well in offering and bin accepted if thou do well shalt thou not be accepted but because he did bonum and not bene being an evil doer and a sinner when abel being righteous did both and was accepted yet he was not accepted in his material doing that which else was good in which case israels most solemn assemblies were iniquity as those of saints and believers are not notwithstanding ds say so because their hands were defil'd with blood and their fingers with moral iniquity so by faith which purified abels heart and wrought by love and overcame the world in him and the lust thereof and which was both made and proved to be true and perfect by his works did abel and so all true saints and believers also do come to offer a more excellent and acceptable sacrifice then that of cain and his wicked race by which they obtain not mans but gods own testimony that they are righteous as zachariah and elizabeth both did in the place and case now in hand which testimony of god who counts no things to be other wise then they really and truly are is true and will stand against all t.d's to the contrary and will be believed before his by every true believer though many such nominal believers as himself is will believe no more of what god himself declares plainly by such holy ones as wrote the scripture then what they list and that's little or nothing at all of that that leaves them no license at all to please the lust and therefore the righteousnes blamelesness innocency harmlesness of the sons of god themselves phil


that are found in all good conscience towards both and without rebuke before both god and men whose blameless and righteous works which are from god himself and not of themselves isa



deeper dye then that of pauls own exact pharisaical traditional external conformity to the meer outward letter or law of a carnal commandement in matter of external ordinance which yet to the full was as good as any of that religion or righteousness of our morally unrighteous pharisaical christians now gloryed in by our literallists legallists must be made no other then parralel'd with that of man phil


which had no more also then the testimony of man as to that denomination of blamlesness righteousnesse yet was in truth because lying in outward observation of fleshly ceremony more than inward righteousness and morality no more worth than meer dung with god and as to justification of any one in his sight that doted on it

as to that of zachariah's being guilty of acting sin at that very time in which be as said to be righteous for which he was punished with dumnes whereupon

told him then that in elizabeth their was no fault found however and so one instance might stop his mouth who call'd for an instance of one single person only but quoth he shee might be no more free from sin then he though theres no mention of any sin of hers

rep prov'd her to be blameless and righteous from the text it self it lyes in him to assign some sin of hers if shee had any but that he cannot do but confesses there's no mention of any so that instance stands ore his head still and whereas at the taile of his double tale about his and her sins he tells another to make them three viz that my mouth was stopt and was silenced had nothing to reply because thought fit to be silent when enough was said doth but mistake himself for twas his own mouth that was then stopt insomuch that saw and heard some of those that stood about him take notice of him as meerly cavelling in that matter but he that chuses to outword them he cavills with though to little purpose must chuse to have the last word if he can

but whereas sayes thus but in a word to put it out of doubt zachariah was at that time found guilty of the sin of unbelief and was punisht for it say its more then he will ever prove while he lives that he was so at all much lesse in the very time of which its said that he was righteous
for
that time was before the time of his of which its said that in it he was righteous
but
in a word to put it out of doubt and bring both instances clear ore his head again ther's no such thing mentioned in the least of zachariahs sinning much lesse of being punisht for his sin for howbeit he did not so fully at first as he did after believe the angells news of his having a son it being very unlikely sith his wife and he both were very old and thereupon desired honestly a sign by which he might the more assuredly know and give credit to it as others without sin desired in like cases the like before him

yet is he neither blamed nor threatned nor lesse puisht as dreams with dumbnesse for not believing till he had a sign as for a sin but his dumbnesse was given as an answer of his desire of a sign and as a sign of the certainty of the thing that he might the more undoubtedly believe it eccle

whereby shall know this glad tidings quoth zachariah for we are old
behold quoth the angel thou shalt be dumb till the day that these things shall be performed since thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season

there remains one scripture more that urged against perfection which he desired my answer to at the propounding of which he sayes was silenced and yet brings me in himself as answering to it in the very next words that spake at all whereby men may see how he makes a matter of nothing of it to utter lies and to prove them to be lyes as soon as he has done

the text is eccles

there is not a just man upon earth that doth

good and sinneth not the sum of my answer which renders as raggedly as he can so that men may not tell what to make of it was this viz
there are no dwellers upon earth that sin not but there are some that have a bodily abode upon earth whose dwelling is not on earth but in heaven whose conversation or politeuma or habitation mil

sin not as all they do wo to them therefore that are inhabitants of the earth for the devil is cast out of heaven and hath no place there and is come down to the other in great wrath but they that are in heaven are on with the lamb redeemed from the earth and in their mouth is found no guile for as the lamb himself who is their saviour is unspotted doing no evill so are they without fault before the throne of god rev
which answer of mine which was also g.ws is mine here again to t.d so far was then from using it as a meer evasion as sayes he verily believes then did in mine own iudgment and intention but not well knowing what to reply to it replyes nothing at all to it in his rejoinder but
pamp calls it absurd and not worth a further reply then what he gives
pamp which is so jejune that can find nothing in it but skin and bone he tells us the iust man being in heaven in our sense excludes not his local being here on earth

rep nor do we say it does though he there thinks we do think so but what of this we deny not his bodily and local abode here on earth t.d who can do no other then give us all our questions cannot and therefore doth nor deny but confesse it that he hath a present being also in heaven and thats as much as we need wish him to yeild to as in order to the yeilding us our cause and if he should deny a true real being of the sons of god in heaven while they are locally and bodily here on earth we should force him to confesse it from iohn
where its said of the son of man mark in praesenti that he is in heaven while yet he stood bodily on the earth he tells us we run very low in this answer but alas it is too high for him who is on earth with all his reason to reach any sound reply to as in us seems to be without us and inward to be outward to him who lives not in heaven within but on earth without so to him that stands as t.d doth on his head with his heals upwards and his head down towards the earth where his feet and heels onely should be as downward seems to be upward so does upward to be downward but so it seems to the great whore that rides the beast or that woman thats cloathed in scarlet and for a time tramples the holy city under feet rev
yet things seem no otherwise then they are to the woman cloathed with the sun who hath her head crowned with the starrs and all fading sublunary glory and the moon it self under her feet rev

as to ds trifling reply to what urg'd from heb
where paul sayes the saints were come to mount sion the city of the living god the

new ierusalem into which let t.d esolve himself whether any uncleannesse or defilement can enter from rev
and to myriards of angels and to the general assembly and church of the being whose names are written in heaven

cor
and iohn
be true much more so as to make one body with them as t.d divines it doth as to that say so far as it is fit to be replyed to g.w hath done it whose reply stands unshaken by that feminine tempest or stood of impertinent words wherewith t.d who sayes much to as litle purpose would seem to patch up a return and what said in short the body of christ is perfect may be ventured among wise men to stand as it does against d's little less then blasphemous that the body of christ is not perfect for his particle yet whereby he mends that matter saying not yet perfect because some that belong to it are yet unborn this helps him not a tittle who holds with the scripture to have bin of old from moses a perfect rule and canon speak ad their own sense not mine whilst many books of it were yet not written and so shall vouchsafe it no more then so and the rather because that reply of t:d to g:w was replyed to some months since but that it was neglected to be printed by such as were intrusted to see it done and whether it yet may or may not be printed before this of mine be out cannot say
unspeakably much more might be said both in disproof of such toyes as our talk against it by and in proof of that possibility of a perfect living without sin before death then shall here take notice of yet
or things that are upon me am free to give some small bint of t:d tells us god will have us excercis'd in that work of mortifying sin while we live therefore lest we should have no more worke to do nor worlds to conquer there must be no full conquest over the world nor perfect mortification of the lust of it till we be dead so some tell us gods children would be proud if he should not keep them down corruption as well as affliction being a most effectual means to make ashamed god will leave as he did once caananites to excerise the israelites and he as thorns in their sides some sins in his saints unsubdued as long as they love to humble and prove them and shew them what is in their hearts and such like

rep
but trow where would pride it self be which is none of the least sins if the saints come by the blood and power of christs light and grace which only humbles to be fully freed and cleansed from all sin and uncleannesse of flesh and spirit and to perfect holiness in the fear of god will not pride it self then be brought down as well as other sins and humility alone be exalted some tells us from kings
the man lives not that sins not

rep we say that ther's no man that lives who hath not sinned and

as iohn sayes he is a lyar that sayes otherwise of himself but because men have sinned and have sin must they never be purg'd is there a necessity that they who now have it and now sin must needs have it and must needs sin till they dye and if they may cease from sinning as our divines also but that they forget themselves tell us they may yea must or dye for ever every tree lying for ever as it falls and there being no purgatory after death say if they may and must before they dye is it then unpossible that they should and if they may ne'r so little before they dye suppose a day a week a year leave sinning may they not by the same power and light live without it or many years before but that as the plain truth is they are in love with it and loath to part with it till it parts with them and to take heed to that light and grace that is given of the lord to lead them out of it to repentance from it and to learn them to deny it and to live without it godly righteously and soberly in this present world in which neglect the hands of the evil doer are strengthned by our dirty dawbers who tell them they must leave sin all sin little sins and yet to go round again that they cannot possible leave all while they live so strengthening the hands of the wicked that he can't return from his wickedness by such pleasing and lullabies as these not a just man uppon earth that does good and sins not and the saints have their infirmityes and david himself was overtaken with adultery and murder and yet stood accepted with god and was even when under the guilt of those gross sins not in a condemned but in a justified estate and prov
who can say have made my heart clean and such like not heeding that though none can nor do we assert any such thing that we have any sufficiency of our selves to good yet alsufficiency is in god and his grace is sufficient so that god can if men look to him in his light make clean the heart and man a young man in whom youthful lusts are strong by the power of god and taking heed to his way by his word in his heart may cleanse his way and so some do though they are but few nor does who can say am clean from mine iniquity not one exclude all from cleannesse implying only as often such interogations do no otherwise then thus viz that few can for though an interogation affirmative of this sort for the most part concludes negatively yet not alwayes universally so but some are included in the affirmative both according to the poets and the prophets quis legit haec per so isa who believeth our report vel duo vel neme few or none

adde to this these considerations in proof thereof if sin be christs enemy in his saints which none denyes then must it be destroy'd in them before not after death for the last enemy that is to be destroyed is death
but the st is true therefore this latter

again the perfecting of the saints is the very end of christs ministry to the eph
which end it must accomplish in this life or not at all for it ceases in that to come as scripture and prophecy and all such mediums do as i.o confesses being accommodated presenti huic statui to this present world onely ex

and if it be not here attainable and freedom from sin not possible to be accomplished then ye make christs ministry as imperfect as your own absit blasphemia the perfection of every thing consisting in nulla alia re quoth i.o ex

no other thing then in its sufficiency

to attain its end and in every discipline that quoth he is to be counted imperfect which sinem propositum suum assequi potis non est is not of force to effect its propounded end

yea not onely the act of regeneration which is all ye count as attainable here but also the
act or consummation and perfection of it is attainable and is the very end of the true spirituall ministry of christ which is his gift and infallible for the text runs so concerning that ministryes continuance here which ceases after death till we all come into the unity of the faith and knowledge of the son of god to know him all alike and to one perfect man even to the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of christ so that all that are truly born from above of water and the spirit not bastards born of flesh into a talk of the new birth that yet know it not into the divine nature of christ may come up into the measure of his stature to be as he is in whom is no sin to walk as he walk'd in this world ioh

ioh
or else the end of the ministry is frustrated and to say that god appoints a means to an end no way attainable
i.o himself detests that as his principles are and so do all that hold that undenyable maxime that deus nil facit frustra
again tis the end of the scripture quoth persicere omniae to perfect all things pertaining to our salvation therefore perfect salvation from sin is here attainable otherwise the scripture is not perfect as sayes it is to its own end sith it ceases in the world to come as he confesses also therefore though he contradict himselfe so as to say the scripture obtains not its end here yet if his saying that it does obtain its end and its end is saving the soul be true this ad hominem is an argument out of his own mouth sufficient to evince to the stoppoing of it a possibility of being saved from sin in this life
again they that walk not after the flesh and fulfill not the lusts of it sin not for sin is the fruit and effect of the lust which must conceive be consented and yielded to before sin can be brought forth iam
a man must be led away of his own lust before he sins
but there be some that walk not after the flesh that fulfil not the lust of it

and howbeit
yeares before that paul hast a thorn in the flesh a messenger of satan to buffet him least through many revelations he should be exalted above measure whence the ministers of the night and darknesse argue a mai ad that paul sinned while he liv'd much more must others not heeding that his thorn was but a temptation to prevent his transgression and therefore a transgression of itself for christ was tempted yet never sinned and beside though it lay haunting and attempting him and was not soon removed yet on his prayer that grace was given which was sufficient to support him under it so that he fell not by it yet if it had proved a transgression twould not have proved him that sine'd
yeares ago to have been a sinner now much lesse to have sinned so long as he lived and so to have been an as for example for all seeming saints to argue from that they may safely and must unavoidably continue sinning to their dying day
therefore salvation from sin is attainable in this life yea this very conclusion here inferr'd is in plain termes asserted by peter of the saints pet

of whom he sayes that they received the end of their faith the salvation of their souls which salvation say till is from the sin which slayes and separates it from god or else from nothing

moreover such as walke after the spirit and in the light and are led thereby these sin not nor do the deeds of darknesse which are sin for the light and spirit lead none into sin but there be such as walk in the light in the day in which if a man walk saith john he stumbles not ioh
much lesse there be some that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and are led by the spirit and those that are led by it are not under the law the lash of which they would be under as all sinners are if they transgressed it but under grace
and these are the sons of god those that are born of god whom the world knowes not ioh
for they are his hidden ones psal
against whom they take crafty councel as against an impure generation though they purify themselves even as christ himselfe is pure whilst such as know neither the sons of god nor whose sons themselves are while they sin are that generation that's pure in their own eyes though not yet washed from their filthiness nor meaning to be so here
who ever walkes after the spirit and no more after the flesh and lusts of it at it seems by that very text rom
some do to whom alone theres no condemnation because no sin for they are in christ so out of the transgression in the light out of the darknesse in but one of which a man can be at one time such sin not who ever they be unless t.d i.o and the whole gang of blind guides who tell people that none but that person that christ appeared in a ierusalem ever were shall or can be freed from sinning in this world will being shooes in that sink of sottishness run ore boots too so as to say the light and spirit leads such as follow and walk after it into lust and sin therefore there are some that live without sinning

and this is one infallible argument from the very letter it self if it were not become now as a book sealed to the learned lookers into it that freedom from sin was attainable by the power of christs light and the grace of god which alone even we say is sufficient to that end and was attained by paul and others then and therefore may be now even in this life in that declares concerning law of the spirit of life which is in christ iesus the head from whence as the holy ointment it runs down to the skirts of the garment and as the unction ioh
abides in his body teaching all things it had made him free from the law of sin and death of which law of sin and death he relates in that
chapter that he was once wretched by reason of its carrying him captive to it self of its motions of sin working in him and bringing forth fruit in him unto death of its warring in his members against the light or law of god in his mind by which he had the knowledge of sin in the very lust of it as that he should not covet nor lust to envy anger uncleanness
which the scribes and pharises mat
and paul himself while a pharisee looking into the without only as he did from a child knew not till he turn'd to the light within and came to the law in the spirit till he and it came to look each other in the face from which time and not from his looking into the letter he saw the law in the spirituality holinesse righteousness and goodnesse and for all his former formality and strict pretence to unrighteousness profession of a letter ad extra his own meer naughtinesse and carnality as that of one that was still sold under sin and a committer of it in the sight of god from whose wrath that old drosty dunghilly righteousnesse of his own phil

which was not christs as blasphemously belyes it to be

pamp could not deliver him till he witness'd himselfe cloth'd with another even that righteousness which is of god by faith in christ not imputed onely but imparted also to the true sanctification as well as justification of every one that believeth which passages nevertheless of that chap to the romans and that
of his
ep to the corinthians our senseless seers have made among others one of their main common places from whence to prove the very contrary even that there is no such freedom from sin while in the body but that of necessity it must be acted by the saints themselves while they breath upon this outward earth for say they if paul complained of a body of sin and death while he liv'd and how he was sold under sin and carryed captive to the law of it and of the law of sin in his members against the law in his mind so that he could not do the good he should but when he would do good evill was present with him and also of a thorne in his flesh a messenger of satan to buffet him as he does cor
and all this after his conversion to his dying day then much lesse can any other saints expect to be set so free from sin by what power soever in this life as to live and not sin and such like but paul did so therefore what man can do otherwise who can ever live and not sin

thus they argue against qua as a damnable sort of hereticks that deliver a doctrine of devils because they hold out as attainable that hellish thing as they count it call'd holiness and such freedom from sin in this life so as not to commit iniquity any more not considering all this while that paul in those terms speakes what he once was yea even after his conversion to the light till sin was wholly subdued by the light condemning it in his flesh and

bringing forth in him judgement over it into victory and not of what he was at the writing thereof in which time he sayes the law of the spirit had made him free from that law of sin not yet heeding at all that the thorn in the flesh was not a transgression but a temptation with which god exercised him that he might shew the sufficiency of his own grace to support and keep him from transgression even from that sin of being exalted above measure and that no lesse then
years before he wrote this and not just then when or while he wrote it much lesse a transgression that remain'd unmortified in him till his dying day

one argument more shall urge from o's own book thus viz if perfect salvation from sin be the proper end of the scripture and it be perfect to that its end and does perfect it and yet does what it does in this present world or nowhere to which it is accomodated only and ceases to do ought into the world to come then that perfect salvation must be wrought out by it or here or no where at all but all the former are asserted abundantly ore and ore again as truth by himself ex therefore the conclusion is consequently true that its either here or no where again they all say in opposition to the pope ther's no purgatory in the world to come therefore it must be here or no where unlesse they know any other world between this present world that which is to come which middle world though have heard some talk of a world in the moon am not yet acquainted with
there be some therefore that sin not in whom the law is not transgrest but sin condemn'd and judged in their flesh so that the righteousnes of the law by christs power is fulfild in them and they walk not after the the flesh but after the spirit which is the end of gods sending his son in the likenesse of sinful flesh and of his sending out his light into mens hearts even that law of the spirit of life which is in himself viz to make men free from that law of sin and death which sometimes they obeyed to condemnation and to condemn sin in the flesh and out of it also by his iudgment brought forth into victory over it that his righteousness might be revealed and the righteousness of the law which he fulfilled in himself might be by him fulfilled in us also many more passages truly there are in d's and o's books besides these many that have bin spoken to some of which are worth no more being but confusion then confutation and some of which also are not worth so much and therefore shall draw to an end making many books and much writing being wearisom but by these men maybe admonished what a meer fallible kind of guidance they must expect from their university admired leaders while they hate the light of god in their own hearts and hang only on their lying lips for their learning the truth of christ

confusions and rounds about iustification

as to the doctrine of iustification by christ and his righteousnesse within us

they tell us one while that the
question debated on at sandwich and held in the affirmative by the quakers was stated in these terms
whether our good works are the meritorious cause of our iustification which is a lye with a witness witnesse t.d who tells it
of his first pamphlet
otherwhiles to go round again leaving out the term our which quite alters the state of the question and makes it altogether another this truth is told us viz that the terms of the
question were whether good works be the meritorious cause of our iustification which was expressely affirmed by the qua witnesse hen oxenden iohn boys esquires mr nath barry mr thomas seyliard mr char nicolls ministers a few of very many witnesses quoth t.d in his epist to the reader of the terms of the questions agreed to by the qua who will free me and how well they free him let all the world judge from the suspition of a partial relator witnesse also t.d himself who if it be the same t.d as no doubt it is who wrote both that book and the epistle and narrative thereto annexed in
of the book to the contradicting and confounding of himselfe in the former tale together with those his own witnesses tells all that truth that is last related

they tell us one while that is when we not only assert it but evince it from the rule of contraries that its rank popery to say good works deserve iustification

otherwhiles that is when to the contradiction of themselves they assert and evince the same from the same rule then to go round again it's no popery witnesse t.d who in
of his
pamphlet sayes s.f shews himself a rank papist indeed in so arguing yet
in proof of himselfe to be a good protestant no papist allows himself so to argue viz evill works which are the violation of the law deserve damnation ergo good works which are the fulfilling of the law deserve salvation that he knows no good works such· but christs to which answer nor do know any good works such but christs and adde own all good works such that are christs and there t.d dissents in not owning all christs own good works such but some only namely such as he did at ierusalem and some even of christs own good works as namely all such as he works in his saints who works all their good works in them isa
as no better then dung losse and filthy rags witnesse his blind blending of these two distinct businesses into one and the same viz the righteousnesse wrought by men without christ and the righteousnesse wrought in men by christ or our good works alias mans own righteousnesse wrought only by men in their own wills wisdome strength according to their thoughts imaginations conceits traditions without christs light and spirit which is that only the spirit calls ours that is as an unclean thing as filthy rags isa
which god speaking to israel that being ignorant of gods righteousnesse went about to establish their own rom
calls thy righteousnesse thy works which cannot profit nor deliver isa
and which paul phil

stiles his own righteousnesse which was of the law as in opposition to that of god and christ and those good works of christ in our persons in performing whereof the righteousnesse of the law is said though by christs power only to be fulfilled in us rom
or that righteousnesse which is though in the saints yet of god alone through their faith in christ iesus the light phil
for these two righteousnesses the one whereof who is not blind may see to be only mans own which is worse then naught and avails not the other only christs own which must be of infinite worth and desert to justifie as t.d also to the further confounding of himselfe truly confesses
pam from the dignity of the person or subject i.e christ in us by whom it's performed t.d confounds together both into one and the self same and consequently concludes himself unavoidably to be respectively both a self contradictor and which is worse a most abominable blasphemer for if the righteousnesse and obedience that is by christs power performed in his saints persons be both christs own and yet mans own also

then being one and the same individual righteousnesse it must have a mutual participation of the same properties and denominations respectively so that if christs own righteousnesse may be said to be of worth and desert to salvation as it truly is by himselfe then mans pauls the saints own righteousnesse which t.d sayes was christs received from christ wrought by christ must be consequently meritorius also and that's a piece of rank popery and wretched foppery of t.ds own broaching who

yet would father it upon the qua which the qua who own all mans own righteousnesse to be as the scripture sayes of it unclean dung losse and filthy rags and utterly unprofitable do as utterly abhorre and so t.d makes himselfe a merit monger with a witnesse such as never yet was found among the qua that at dover himself whom t.d belyes in that particular not excepted

and again if mans pauls the saints own righteousnesse may be said as it truly is isa

phil
to be unprofitable unclean dung losse and filthy rags then the self same which paul and other saints their own righteousnesse being no other then christs then what they receive from him and he works in them as t.d sayes for their sanctification some of christs own righteousnesse yea even that too which serves for the saints sanctification and to make the saints meet for that possession where unclean thing must enter

must be unprofitable unclean dung losse and filthy rags which is no lesse then point blank blasphemy yea in expresse terms
deny our justification by christ in us quoth he by that righteousnesse in us whereof christ is the author as if that christ in us and that righteousnesse of his in us which is the same with that without us deserved nothing


moreover in saying there are two righteousnesses of christ when as the righteousness of christ whether in himself or in his saints is but one he crouds confusion upon confusion in the eye of every clear considerer of his inconsiderable stuff which cannot but see that what god joyns together as one this he separates and puts asunder what is truly one and undivided as christ and his righteousnesse is this he divides and distinguishes into two righteousnesses things meant by that one name of christ his person and his operations in us the latter whereof he denys for righteousness to justification but what things are truly and distinctly two and ought accordingly to be and by the lord are divided separated and put asunder as mans pauls the iewes own righteousnesse and that righteousnesse which is of god by faith in christ received from and wrought by christ in his saints which the scripture rom phil

opposes and speaks of as in contradistinction each to other these two t.d and his brother builders whose work it is to build babel or confusion as their reward is the division of their tongues confound and jumble both together into one

they tell us one while that truth christ tells his disciples matth

that except our righteousnesse exceed that of the scribes and pharisees whose lives yet ad extra as to all outward appearance were as exact as they were strict in many religious observations we shall in no case enter into the kingdom
whereby they intimate we must live walk and obey gods holy truth and will

though by christs assistance yet personally more spiritually then they yea they tell us what the gospel requires from us though it is to be done by christ in and for us is a more total abstinence from evil and even lusting to it then the law and so the gospel to call for more full then the law if ere we live the one saying thou shalt not commit adultery the other thou shalt not lust the one thou shalt not steak the other thou shalt not covet the one forswear not thy self the other swear not all the one thou shalt not kill the other thou shalt not be angry without cause

otherwhiles to go round again they make the law require more full and exact obedience to god then the gospel the law gives not life without perfect obedience quoth t.d
the gospel gives life upon imperfect obedience

again they tell us one while that is when they preach to their people and see no quakers among them the same truths the scriptures tell us concerning god that he is of purer eyes then to behold the least iniquity that god john
accepts not owns not hears not sinners says to such as work it and depart not from iniquity depart from me all ye workers of iniquity know not whence ye are matt
luke
and though forgiving iniquity to the penitent when they confesse and forsake sin yet by no means clearing the guilty while they lye in impaenitency under sin exod
that if the heart condemn god in greater then it and knows all and what the light in the conscience speaks in way of that that's placed in us and seconds it to justification or condemnation accusation or execusation there needs no witnesse to convince a man quoth i.o
that it speaks it from god it discovers it's author from whom it is in whose name it speaks so that if that as it does every sinner holds guilty god whose mind it speaks holds not guiltlesse yea that he who justifies the wicked condemns the just even they both are abomination to the lord as pro
and much more of that sort i:e when the qua tell the same truths to turn men from all sin which is transgression or iniquity for not the least sin is equity that know of then in opposition to the qua they wheel about and

otherwhiles as if god were another manner of god who because its impossible by the power of his own grace to be fully freed and perfectly purged from all sin here will give indulgency to his sinning saints to go round again they tell us other tales of him whereby if pro
be true they represent him as doing that in the doing of which he must be an abomination to himselfe viz
that he condemns the just witnesse t.d who tells us that here the best works and personal performances of beleevers and saints themselves are imperfect sin iniquity dung losse unclean filthy rags though done by christ in them and yet to go round again that god accepts alias is wellpleased delights and takes pleasure in both these beleevers and their wicked works witnesse the supralapsarian
predestination preachers who represent god as loving of few only as iacob hating most men personally with esau qua sic as men the creatures of his own creation to shew his wrath power soveraignty over them as the potter over the clay of the same lump the mistery of which matters of iacob and esau their meer mans wisdom sees no more into then a moles eye into a milstone not onely before they had done either but

without reference to either good or evil foreseen to be done in time by either adam their supposed representative or themselves and the sublapsarians also who represent god as by praeterition at least rejecting most on the account meerly of adams single act without a respect to any personall actions of their own the least and best of which two do doctrinally make god a condemner for ever of millions of just innocents yea very infants as they blush not to infer for one fault of their father adam for whose only eating the sowr grapes all the childrens teeth must be set on edge contrary to what god sayes now who will have that proverb used no more but sayes as the soul that sinneth shall dye for his own so every man only for his own iniquity and not the son for the fathers any more then the father for the sons


that he condemns not but clears the very guilty justifies the very wicked and ungodly that not from for the qua know that he justifies many ungodly ones from their ungodlinesse they repenting not resisting his spirit by which he would purg them but giving up to become the godly whom only he hath chosen ps
but even in the most wicked and ungodly actions and even whilest under the guilt of most abominable transgressions so wearying the lord whom they speak well of sometimes as a god of with their evill words of him at other times when they say with the wicked priests of whom god by malachi complains ch
of such as do evil that they are good in the sight of the lord and he delighteth in them or where is the god of judgement as if he who changes not and said of old shall count them pure mic
did change and become another kind of god at one time then he is at another viz to count men righteous even while such treasures of wickednesse are in the house of their hearts as render them no lesse then wicked scanty and abominable and to count men as know not that ever he did pure with their wicked ballances with their bag of deceitful weights while they are full of violence and speak lyes and their tongue is deceitful in their mouths witnesse not only all other his fellow under their arms and soothers up of sinners in their sins and daubers of with the smooth untempered morter of their peace peace when there is no peace saith my god unto the wicked but t.d himself above all the rest who
pam
not only sayes but still stands to it and owns it or'e and or'e again as grosse as it is and iustifies it for truth in his reply to who charges it on him as a grosse absurdity which have above also more at large replyed to that david even when he was guilty mark that of adultery and murder such sins as for which the scripture when he lay impenitent under them denotes and excepts him as a man not upright a despiser of god and his commandemenes a doer of evil in his sight sam
whom god also had not mercy on but did both condemn and severely judge with no lesse then hellish horrors for his filth bloodguiltinesse till he had repented for it and was throwly purged from it psalm
was not in a condemned but in a justified estate
so that the sum of t.d and those doctors doctrine that side with him therein is this viz to begin the dance right david while he commited adultery and murder not repenting was guilty before god and consequently not just nor justified but condemned for whom god holds not guiltlesse but guilty they are not justified accepted acquitted absolved approved but which is all one accused reproved condemned in his sight yet to go round again david while he committed adultery and murder

not yet repenting was not guilty before god but held guiltlesse not condemned nor reprobated or reproved but cleared acquitted absolved excused approved for between the two slates of guilty and not guilty non datur medium

contradictions confusions and rounds about liberty of conscience
ii
as to the doctrine for liberty of conscience and against persecution for cause of conscience in matters of religion
one while they tell the world the doctrine and practice of rigid imposing upon any sub penâ or persecuting any tender consciences for beleeving and living according to their conviction or denying to beleeve or live contrary thereunto is a bloody tenet a way to make more hypocrites that for fear will conform to what they beleeve not to be truth then true christians an evident note of a false church and antichristian ministry that is degenerate and apostatized from the true pure primitive church of christ which never did compel any by force and violence to be christians but rather suffered all sorts of sorrowes and bare all manner of abuses from the whole world of false worshippers whether heathens or nominal christians barely for confessing to the truth of christ and testifying against the evil lives of all christs enemies whether such as hated the very outward name of christ or such as named his name and yet departed not from iniquity and were every where cursed yet blessed the cursers of them prayed for such as persecuted them intreated those that desamed and them and were patient silent when reviled and buffeted beaten banished as vagabonds because for truths sake they often left their own homes and had no certain dwelling place as seditious tumultuous disturbers of the peace because they peaceably went into synagogues to reason and preach the gospel of peace as turners of the world upside down because they sought to change men from their evill manners foolish customs vain inventions and wicked wayes that were abominable to god and to bring them to repentance from their dead works and worships in which their souls could never live to worship the living god who is a spirit and not tyed to places in spirit and in truth in the inner parts and to turn all men from the darknesse wherein they lived in the world without to the light of christ within themselves and from the power of satan unto god
sometimes say our great gamaliels not only grant these things but also give them out for truth to the civill powers of the earth most especially then and that with no small greedinesse when the clergy of one kind feel themselves begin to be griped under the greedy clutches of the clergy of another colour when they are likely to be imposed upon by others and to be clapped down under hatches by the clerical cruelties of each other respectively as for example where ever the papal or roman or else the presbiterian primacy keeps the keys spreads their black eagles clams over all others hath the power of permitting or poenal imposing there the prelatick pastoralty pleads his priviledge to have the liberty of his liturgy he behaving himselfe no otherwise then peaceably among them

otherwhiles again yea ever when the clergy of any one colour hath by either craft or conquest catcht the keyes of the kingdome and atchieved the holy chaire they straightway clap their cruell clawes upon them to the keeping down by force of armes more then arguments all liberty for any consciences but their own

as to our doctrine of the present guidance of christs church and ministry by his own infallible spirit they tell us sometimes or at least yeeld to us when we tell them that at this day they only that are led by the spirit of god are the sons of god that if any have not christs spirit and the guidance thereof which is an infallible spirit and guidance for we know no fallible spirit that he hath nor fallible guidance that that spirit hath which leads undoubtedly all men and ministers that follow it and not the lustings of the flesh against it into no sin out of all errour into all truth being truth it selfe and no lye and that some there are now that are led of that spirit and walk after it and not after the flesh as then there were rom
gal

by and by they finding themselves erring and contradicting one another and no betier guided in things of god then by their own thoughts uncertain conjectures crooked conceits whereby they crosse one another in their several senses meanings about the one mind of christ in that one writing which they call their rule because they follow their own flashy fancies and not the spirit and measuring all others by themselves to go round again they tell us another thing and make it no lesse then a matter of meer pretence and high presumption not so much as safely to be supposed that a man should be now theopnuestos divinely inspired or infallibly guided by gods spirit in these dayes as it that spirit

did not continue his infallible but afforded only some kind of fallible guidance to his church ministry now and led them as r.b.i.t also say the light within did the heathen
in somethings well in most into crooked and dangerous wayes and that makes these men sometimes bid men attend and sake heed to it sometimes again cane pejus et angue reject detest and take heed of it as shall shew more by and by witnesse i.o in the places above talkt with where he talks down all divine inspiration and guidance now a dayes by the infallible spirit as matters but falsely pretended to



and t.d who denys his own ministry to be infallible and thereby proclaming those to be but fools who follow it accuses the qua of falsehood with a witnesse for once offering to affirm this truth that theirs which yet is truly christs ministry is infallible as quoth he to the infallibillity of their ministry jurates of sandwich will testifie that they did affirm their ministry to be infallible which if it were not say would yeeld our selves to be as very fools who suffer for it as those would be who also suffer for attending to it

contradictions confusions rounds concerning the large love and rich mercy of god to all mankind
iv
as to the doctrine of gods great grace universal love and rich mercy to all men they extoll it in their proclamations of it one while as an infinite boundlesse bottomlesse bounty matchlesse mercy endlesse large love exceeding rich grace lifting up their voyces among all people to this or the like tune the rich infinite unexpressible unconceiveable incomprehensible love of god in christ iesus to all mankind to the whole world so hath he loved the world a sic without a sicut that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever beleeves in him might not perish but have everlasting life god sent not be son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he is not willing any one of you should perish but that all should come to repentance and be saved in the acknowledgement of his truth
therefore ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters come and buy wine milke but without mony without price god is free of what he hath onely the priests that have freely received and should as freely give give them their fees let them have money and price and pay and augmentations and maintenance enough god looks for nothing
come unto christ all ye that labour and are heavy laden here's rest for all your souls the spirit and the bride say come and who ever will let him come and take of the water of life freely obje oh but we are sinners will god own us answ art thou a sinner then who ere thou art thou art one of those christ came to save become to save that which was lost to take away the sins of the world
obj oh but we are great sinners wicked wretches such as never were the like multiplying sins transgressions is there any hope for us

answ if we confesse our sins he is faithful and just to forgive them pardoning iniquity transgression and sin christ hath received gifts for the rebellious he tasted death for every man he is a propitiation not for some only but also for the sins of the whole world he opens the door of salvation to all his tender mercies are over all his works he delights to magnifie his mercy above all it rejoyceth against judgement come all and welcome none shall be cast off in any wise that come to him he would have all to come he is not willing that any should

perish behold bring you glad tydings of great joy to all people a saviour is borne unto them from god theres peace proclaimed good towards men though they are enemies to him by wicked works yet god is in christ reconciling the world to himselfe not imputing trespasses to any that will be reconciled unto him he swears that he hath no pleasure in the death of him that dyeth but had much rather that the wicked should turn from his wickednesse and live and therefore he hath sent his son a light to the nations and so to be his salvation even to the ends of the earth and this he also declares to men as his good will to them all and calling to all to look to him and be saved universally freely truly without mockage tendering peace to all offering salvation to all men intending no otherwayes then he sayes that every individual that turns to him shall have it and hath wrought in them to will and to do and now would have them will do hath given every one a talent in which trading he shall enter into the joy but being unfaithful with and not improving thereupon only they are shut out and abundance more of the like which is all precious and the plain truth of the scripture which they call the revealed will of god according to which only we must judge of gods mind to

otherwhiles again that is when the qua come to question them before their people whether it be so in very deed or no as they say that god is so much more prone to mercy then severity and is so truly loving to all mankind to all sinner and so consequently to all men for all are but sinners provided they accept his grace given and improve it be not wanting to themselves and come to him whether he would honestly heartily as he says that all should come and would come and would not have them ponere obitem hinder their salvation and put it away from them and that god as truly intends their good as they extend the newes of it if men refuse not the offer and would indeed have them accept of the offer and not slight it

then come let us sing a new song to go round again the divine doctrine of gods universal love is drawn in again as damnable heresie and his grace niggarded up into a corner and his mighty mercy diminisht into a mite and a tale told us that this is but a generall outside profer he intends not truly that all shall come to him by repentance and have benefit by the death of his son he dyed not for all but though its said all every man by all he means but a few and he hath not put all so much as into a capacity or common possibility of life by his son nor into so much as an ability to come to him the most can't chuse life that they may live they may chuse death that they may dye and must chuse that being afore of old ordained to condemnation and so though mercy and misery blessing and cursing be set before them and they bid to chuse yet their wills must of necessity chuse the curse having it not wrought in them as a few have so much as to will and to do any good and so though they have good and evill to chuse which they will of the two yet when all's done as the case is they must hobsons choice cleave to the evil and chuse whether they will have that or none having not only no arbitrium liberum but not so much as liberatum they are yet lockt up to a post by adams fall years before they were born and were never unloosed to this day nor ever must be so as to be at liberty to come when they are call'd and yet must be condemned too for not coming
they have enough given them to leave them

without excuse damn them but christen sub nulla considerationem quoth i.o exer
christ in no case hath given a saving light to all nor god grace sufficient to save them unto them all christ comfort thats the childrens bread it belongs not to the dogs christ dyed and is given only for the world of the elect that beleeve but the most not only do not but cannot beleeve and besides there's no saviour for the most to beleeve in as theirs being sent in gods love but to a few so that if the most if all should beleeve him to be theirs the most must beleeve a lye for tis not so yet to go round again this withall they must know that they must be condemned for not beleeving a lye for not beleeving that which if they should all beleeve the most must beleeve a lye for he that beleeves not is condemned because he beleeves not in the only begotten son of god and this and no other thing is their condemnation but because christ is come a light into the world and they come not to it beleeve not in it but love the darknesse more then it otherwise christ came not into the world to condemn the very world which is condemned but to this intent that the world throw him might be saved
and to go round again though they are sent to make such fair proffers promises and large proclamations of gods love yet this is but his revealed will he does but do this to make men beleeve he is so loving to them as to give his own son for them that if they beleeve it not as he knows they cannot faith being his gift and that which he will give but to few and leave the most unable to beleeve he may come the more in wrath against a hundred to one of mankind and take vengeance on them for their not beleeving that false testimony which in his revealed will he gives by us of his son but he hath a secret will hidden from us wherein he far otherwise peremptorily decrees that few only shall be saved and this though hidden from us we declare to be of the twain the very truth indeed

cum multis aliis ejusdem furfuris quae nunc prae scribere longum est

just as if a thousand men fast fettered up in prison standing all condemned to be hanged a messenger should be sent from a king in whose power it is to save or slay them all on what terms he pleases to proclaim the and the of pardon and life to them all and the wonderfull mercy of the king to them all as one more prone by far to mercy then wrath in such wise and to such a purpose as followes

ye poor undon lost men ye lye now at the mercy of the king dead men all but behold am come from him to bring glad tidings of great joy to you all lift up your heads chear up your hearts the king that he may shew he delights more in saving then destroying in mercy then wrath though for displeasing him not personally but paternally in your fathers loins he has advantage to cut you all off yet he is resolved to save one of you and hang but and he would every man of you beleeve it for himself that its he in particular he comes to and not to the rest and yet to go round again conditionally that every man of you beleeve it for himself it is to every such individual indeed consequently both to one and all the rest and if ye all unloose your selves out of the chains and come away but that ye can't do and tis not his will ye should and none must give you the keyes ye shall all be spared and know not which that elect one is for my part nor which of you all it is he in tends absolutely to spare that lyes in his secret will but am sent with his revealed

will to tell you that he that can beleeve it its he that is to be favoured he is the man who ere it is and though am sure his love is to but one and are peremptorily personally possitively ordained to dye yet to go round again if ye all beleeve his love to you ye shall all live if any dye tis his own fault because he beleeves not the kings love to him and comes not away out of his fetters and nothing else and though he can't come out of his fetters yet let him know its but just that should leave him there because his father offended the king before he was born its enough for them that he is so rich in mercy to the whole thousand as to save one and proclaim salvation to all with no intent of pardon that he may take the more advantage on the rest by their refusal to come when they cannot to do execution on them with ten fold more wrath rigour and severity then if the pardon never had been proclaimed to them at all

in much what such a rambling confused manner do our and ministers of gods grace consideratis hold out their gospell to all men as embassadours from god to them all
one while extolling extending it over all gods works to all men and otherwhiles when they have carryed it about long in a vast circuit and circumference of commendatory conference to go round again in their niggardly they wind it about and wrap it all up within the narrow corner of their conceited wheel within a wheel or little world of a few elect ones only extenuating it till they allmost quite extinguish it in their talk preach it welnigh into nothing witnesse i.o as is shewed more at large in the book aforesaid and t.d also telling us indeed that god offers salvation to all men but intends it only to a few

contradictions confusions and rounds about the doctrine of perfect freedom from sin attainable in this life


as to salvation from sin in this life which christ gives to all that follow him in his light
one while they teach it to us themselves as attainable here by the grace of god as the qua do in these or the like deliveryes of themselves in their preachings and writings according to the scriptures people ye must deny all ungodlinesse and worldly lusts and live godly righteously and soberly mark in this present world the grace of god that bringeth salvatioe to such as take heed to it and receive it not in vain appears to all men and teaches them so to live but that they turn from it and turn it into wantonnesse and if we walk in the light as god is in the light we then have fellowship with him who hath none with sin and sinners and not only so but also the blood of iesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin and though we cannot say we have no sin since we and all men have sinned yet if we confess our sins god is faithful not only to forgive us our sins past but which is a further matter to cleanse us from all unrighteousnesle having therefore such promises let us cleanse our selves from mark all filthiness of flesh and spirit who knows any more then all perfecting holiness in gods fear the blessed men psal
are the saints or holy ones that do no iniquity but walk in gods way and though ye think well of your selves because your sins are little yet no sin is so little but if liv'd died in its damning therefore take heed of the least iniquityes while ye have time and space given you to repent from them in leave forsake foregoe them live

according to the scripture which allows of no sin which is written that men might not sin which is able through faith to make a man of god perfect and wife to salvation from sin which is perfect to its own end which is salvation which end it attains not hereafter for its of no use then and therefore must do it here or no where so that if you dye in the least of your sins unrepented from better ye had never been born for there's no purgatory in the world to come as the pope sains but as the tree falls it lyes as death leaves you judgement finds you if ye lye down in your graves in your sins you will rise out of them full of sorrowes listen unto christs ministers who are given for the work of the ministry for the perfecting of the saints the edifying of the body till we all come to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullnesse of christ himselfe so as to be as he is in this world and whoever saith he abides in him ought so to walk as himselfe walked in whom was no sin and who hath true hope in him purifieth himselfe as he also is pure and a multitude more sayings of like sort we may hear them utter

otherwhiles that is when the qua call men to the same living without sin telling them these things are possible to be done by gods grace who of his good pleasure hath wrought in men to will and to do so that by the power and sufficiency of that they may now work out their own salvation if they neglect not this day of gods long suffering and salvation wherein god would succour them if they will and that god requires not by either his ministers or their scriptures impossibilities from his creatures under such paenalty as eternall damnation if not performed then to go round again they tell us other matters which as contradictory as they are to those we must notwithstanding or else be held for hereticks believe from them to be the truth viz
that tis most false to affirm that the scripture the perfection whereof they plead to lye in nullâ aliâ re in no other thing then its sufficiency to its end which it can't attain hereafter if not here sith there it ceases as to all its uses either doth or can obtain its end which end they say also is salvation from the sin that destroyes the soul dum in hoc mundo haremus so sayes ex
while we have a being in this world
then they make as if the ministry of them who wrote the scriptures were such as their own is viz a meer antick mockage of men a conclave of contradictions confusions absurdities and rounds a ministry of flat falsities not to say fooleries a of impossibilities wherein they stand all their dayes calling upon all men for money as homines domini in nomine domini in the name of god on pain of his eternall displeasure and their demnation to do what they are to believe to as an article of their faith on pain of the hereticks condemnation all men can never possibly do god empowering but very few by true grace to do ought at all of what he requires nay not empowering any one at all to do all that viz to cease from all sinning against him in the time of this life wherein he requires it to be done by them as being never possible to be done in that to come if neglected here yea then the doctrine of full freedome from sin here is contrary to the tenour of the scripture quoth yea in short no better nor worse then a very doctrine of devils quoth and rumsey both in their book which is so largely answered already in mine above said

so then we have the ministers mind in this poynt tripliciter or rather quadrupliciter

at least about the time of the saints perfect purgation from all sin
first it is somewhere that they all confesse at first
secondly tis not here in this world cry they that comes too near the copyhold of the qua and we would not be ensnared with their beguiling doctrine
thirdly tis not in that to come cry they this puts us poynt blank into the purgatory of the pope we must beware of that lest fleeing too farre from the qua snare we fall into the papists pit
fourthly tis not in any world between this and that to come for there's no such middle world that we know of therefore fifthly to goe quite round to where we were before we began for incidit in seyllam qui vult vitare charybdim it's somewhere as we said at first but we know not where which to go round again is as much as to say for ought we know just at all

howbeit some are not so well aware yet of the traps they talk themselves into thereby but that they will be taking on them precisely to determine where it is when we closely urge them but their testimony hangs as handsomely and is as well tangled together as the links of a pair of pothangers where of every one draws a different way from another for some if askt when the full purging is it is say they while the soul is passing between here and heaven after its departed from the body this as a informes me was ds answer to l.h when askt at sandwich in an assembly of many the precise time and period of the perfect purging so making a purgatory after death notwithstanding which it seems is in the aire and therein only different from the popes which is seigned to be under the earth others that have put the question to say tis a little before the soul departs out of the body to whom when have redoubled my query thus if a little before the soul depart why not a little sooner sith before is but before let it be a longer or a lesser while and if a minute why not an how if an hour why not a day and so caeteris paribus the same means attended to why not a month a year and years many as well as few have received no answer and good reason why because there's none to give and so we take it for granted from them that it's before death however as we say if at all though these contradict t.d who sayes with the pope it's after death others not knowing which to say seeing according to our argument which is thus viz perfect purging if at all must be in this world as the qua say or in that to come as the pope says who seigns a purgatory there for the remnant of sins that remain unpurged away here or else in another world betwixt this and that to come which chimara who ere heard of being now somewhat wary left if they say before the soul go out which is in this world they yield to the qua and if after it's gone out which is the world to come they appeare too near a kin to the pope in his poynt of purgatory affirme it to be in the very undefined span alphabet or moment or instant of the souls departure which is not in tempore it seems not in any time at all but in instanti and so sith instans non est tempus but as it were punctum temporis the instant being but a poynt of time and not properly time it self it seems that

accidit in puncto quod non speratur in aevo

that happens in a poynt of time which could never be so much as hoped to he attained in all the life time before

thus the divines dance between this world and that to come not knowing

yet where purgatory is nor daring to say distinctly one thing nor other whether here or hereafter in this world or that hovering like caesar at rubicon with one foot over the dore sell other on this side one in t'other out one in that world t'other in this world saying with him yet may go on and when afraid yet may go back so tis

somtimes one way then another somtimes both wayes the and t'other somtimes one o'th two take either somtimes twixt both worlds in neither some say si'th aire some say t's i'th earth of knowledge where tis there's a dearth
some say t's here there some some riddle nor here nor there but just i'th middle

contradictions and various absurdities riddles and rounds about their rule of scriptures

as to their doctrine about the scripture or letters and not the spirit and lights being the word of god the fixt firme foundation stable standard truest touchstone or tryall of all truth only sure inalterable invariable infallible rule of holy life they tell us one while not the light within but the hebrew and greek texts and transcripts only

that those that are inconsistent with the sense in their stations of more or lesse weight or moment are but private obscure and novell not above two or three hundred years standing in some late but no antient copies yet by and by to go round again denyes not but that some are not only of such publick and open observation as to be obvious to the view of all but also of long standing witnesse his words
there are quoth he in some copies of the new testament and those some of them of good antiquity diverse readings in things or words of lesse importance and those which are of importance quoth he
have been already considered by others specially glassius is acknowledged the proof of it lyes within the reach of most in the copies that we have and shall not sollicit the reputation of those who have afforded us others out of their own private furniture and pag
of his epist
he grants that there are corruptions mark and various lections in the greek copies of the scripture and our grant quoth is founded on this experience that we evidently find various lections in the greek copies we enjoy and so grant that which ocular inspection evinces to be true and though i.o having yielded the greek text to be corrupted which is enough to prove his foundation faulty and fallible if the hebrew text were to a tittle entire fills up that gap again with this defence viz tet there are none able to shew out of any copies yet extant in the world or that they can make appear ever to have have been extent that ever there were any such various lections in the originalls of the old testament neverthelesse to go round again notwithstanding what hath been spoken quoth he
we grant that there are and have been various lections in the old testament and the new and so falls a shewing in many pages together many varieties in the old testament himself to save his antagonists the labour of shewing what he tells them they are not able to shew some of which are not obscure and private as sayes they are but publick and open as i.o sayes not as sayes they are of no importance but of importance and inconsistent with the sence as sayes to go round again not novell and of late only as sayes they are but as sayes to go round again of longer standing of some good antiquity

thus all this while gives and takes grants and begs back again abates exacts the whole again allows and pulls in again owns and denyes lets go and commands home again his assertion till by a little and a little he hath let it go and

granted it all away and then to go round again fearing he hath let it go too far from serving his turn does what in him lyes though hoe a liquid nihil est by a little and a little to fetch it all in again to his first pretended purpose he goes on granting from ore shooes to ore boots till in the quagmire wherein he quavers too and fro in his quarrel for his foundation he sinks first up to the ankles then up to the knees anon up to the loynes by and by up to the neck

and lastly fearing lest he hath gone so far in granting to the weakening of his own assertion of the texts integrity to a little that he shall hardly ever recover it to stand for truth in that ex sui site primitive posture wherein he at first exerted and propounded it unlesse he utter somwhat more like a man more to the purpose then all those childish pedling put offs i.o urges a knocking argument from the multitude of the copies to the impossibility of the texts being corrupted thus viz
there was a multiplying of copies to such a number that it was impossible any should corrupt them all willfully or by negligence which hath as much reason in it as his other confident conclusions have for riddle me this ye rabbies why might not the same fate fall out to one copy of scripture in its transcribing as to another and if the fate and fault of falsity and mistake to some why not to all yet if it were never such a solid consequence we need not deny it who still saves us the labour of confuting knocks it down and confounds it himselfe while elsewhere he argues from the multitude of copies to the impossibility of their escaping corruptions for to go round again that so many transcriptions quoth he should be made without some variation undefined span alphabet that is impossible thus running out in hast to recover his lost assertion he runs himselfe or'e head and eares in the gulf of most contradiction and irrecoverable confusion yea how many various lections and various contradictions to himself are to be found yet heres not all in os opposing of that one plain undeniable truth viz
that there are various lections in the copies of the very originall texts of the scripture which they call their rule which though they say truly witnesse

that a rule and grid should be certain which will not deceive and that which is variable and alterable cannot be a persons rule for it is the property of a rule to be invariable and the same at all times the rules measures weights dialls squares and what other things are made if they be varyed they cease to be rules for rules should be sized and certain and confesse also that error minimus in principio fit major in medio maximus in fine the least errour in a foundation makes a thing not fit to be a foundation and so if the scripture be not intire to a little so but vel undefined span alphabet one jot or tittle fail and every letter be not preserved by gods providence from being lost they must needs cry out undefined span alphabet they have no footing nor foundation for their faith and see no means of being delivered from utter uncertainty in and about all sacred truth witnesse i.o ep
and much more of that sort in his book as its more at large talkt with in the second of my four exercitations and do confesse also the scripture is not only flexible and lyable to be changed easily at every criticks will and the transcribers might and did fail and mistake so that various sections are thence arisen witnesse
and epist
where he tells how many wayes its easie for a critick to alter it

yet to go round again and face about half way at least they plead the said confessedly variable and much varied text to be the only fixt firm foundation sure basis stable standard right rule true touchstone and such like yea and to go the whole round and face quite about as they were that it is neither so varied nor variable by reason of the loving care and aspect of god over the transcribers whom yet for all he would not guid infallibly whose promise and providence which cannot fail are engaged to preserve the hebrew greek texts in their integrity to a tittle but that its most fit to be own'd as the most perfect and only steady rule and foundation

moreover how entirely true soever the transcriptions are the translations which is all the rule the people have unlesse the priests prattle must be their rule are confessed to be most various and abominably and wofully corrupted witnesse who is scarce more busie to evince the entirenesse of his hebrew and greek text then in evidencing the erroneousnesse of all translations some of which that are most a client and of most account among most priests as the septuagint are gone off quoth from the original in a thousand places twice told
and yet to go round again the only infallible rule and sure word of god which they tell the poor people that they have is the scripture text as it is thus translated for they to them either the infallibility of their own ministry or of the holy chair and any present guidance of any by the infallible spirit also
thus they run the rounds trace to and fro and dance up and down in their dark minds about the transcriptions and translations of their text which they take to be their rule which transcriptions translaions were they never so certain and entire by answering to the first originall copies yet are not capable to be to all men any other then a lesbian rule or nose of wax for as much as even where men have them as halfe the world has not they are liable to be wrested and actually twisted twenty wayes by interpretours whose expositions senses and meanings which are as many and various as the thoughts and conceits and inventions of the men are who comment upon them must be the rule to such as can read them neither in hebrew and greek nor in their own neither and whereas we ask them who tell us that scripture rightly interpreted only is the right rule of the faith by what rule shall we know whether the text be rightly interpreted yea or nay and not rather wrested and what is the rule according to which men are to interpret that rule of their faith i.e that scripture to go round again they tell us the analogy of faith and when we query how it may be known that that faith is right according to which the scripture is if rightly to be interpreted to go round again they tell us the scripture rightly interpreted and when we ask them how it may be known assuredly uncontroleably infallibly that the scripture is at all of god and not a cunningly devised fable invention of men they tell us by the testimony of the spirit which say they is necessary onely allsufficient to that purpose see the articles of the clergy of england about the scripture and when we ask them but by what shall we try and find assuredly infallibly that that spirit is of god and not a false one that tells us the scripture is of god to go round again they tell us by the scripture

moreover as when others deny his asserted authority purity integrity of

the text pleads it to the least tittle and yet to go round again falls flatly to affirm the of it himself so when he dreams those poor deluded fanatical souls as he calls them call'd qua who yet own it as usefull helpfull profitable perfect to its own end through faith in the light to the man of god do deny the perfection of the scripture to its proper end then i.o strikes up in such strict strains of proving the living power efficacy perfection of the said scripture to its own proper end which he sayes is the effecting and perfecting of mens eternall salvation without any help of the spirit and light within stretching it out into such a singular absoluteness this way as that which by it self alone is regula perfectissima ex

ita perfecta omnibus numeru absoluta ut nihil opus sit ulla alia revelatione per spiritum out internum as revelatio omni respectu perfecta ex

potens servare animas restituens onimam potent a dei ad salutem so that inania mutilia sunt alia omnia principia
which all is more fully inculcated at large in greek and english
where he sayes its absolutely call'd the power of god and that to its proper end the rod of his power without other helps and advantages that hath efficacy and power in it to save souls living effectual sharper then any two edged sword as heb
and much more to that tune adoring and extolling the external text with the honour and veneration thats due to god christ and his spirit light and living word in the heart alone

but when i.o comes to quarrel with those poor deluded souls the iews for the self same adoring and glorying in their enjoyment of the naked letter and seeking for life and salvation in the scriptures without the light and spirit within which he and his are found in and condemned by the qua for at this day as they were by christ of old and when he comes to quarrel with the qua for asserting that doctrine of devills as they call it viz attainablenesse of perfect freedom salvation of the soul from sin in this life then runs and rambles round about and about again with as great an ardency as he danced the other way before saying ex

falsissimum est sacram scripturam dum in hoc mundo haeremus respectu nostri totum suum finem obtinere aut obtinere posse it's most false to say the scripture or doth or can obtain its whole end in respect of us while we live here and if we ask where then does it do it in the world to come no neither then scripturae usu its use will then cease its accimmodated to our present state only and if we ask does it do it at all yes quoth he or else it cant't be perfect as assert it to be for ex

disciplinae cujusvis perfectio
in english thus the perfection of every discipline stands in it's relation to its end so as that is to be held perfect which can and that imperfect which potis non est cannot effect its own end and the perfection of the scripture can consist in no other thing then its sufficiency to its own proper end which is the perfecting our eternall salvation which salvation though the scripture be perfect and does accomplish it yet to go round again it can accomplish it neither in this world nor that to come and so not at all and to go round again is imperfect and further yet

that its not so absolutely perfect nor effectually powerfull to this end of saving souls so as to need no other revelation by the spirit or light within as he

says tis witnesse its inefficacy to the iews who are as busie in it to no urpose as himself of whom to go round again sayes

thus the iews enjoy the letter of the scripture yea they receive it sometimes with the honour and veneration due to god alone their possession of it is not accompanied with the manifestation of the spirit will out which as we see in the instance of themselves the word is a dead letter of no efficacy for the good of souls they have it for their further ruine yea while they keep the scripture quoth of the iews and of i.o and such literal christians as he is we shall never ment weapons out of their own armory for their destruction like the they carry the weapon that will serve to cut off their own heads

thus though who sayes elsewhere the scripture is without need of other helps or advantages or revelation by the spirit or light within per se sola sufficiens living absolute full of power and efficacy to save souls and yet rides the rounds so here as to say that without the spirit the word and that's more then the qua dare say howbeit he means thereby but the scripture is a dead latter of no efficacy to the good of souls yet horrendo percussus scotomate he stayes not here but having said the letter is dead rather then the qua he so hates shall be owned by him in saying the that himself sayes hee'l ride round back again to his first stage that he may not seem to side with them and therefore in ex

where i.o brings in the qua arguing strongly against the letters being the only most perfect rule thus est litera mortua spiritus vivisicat quis litera mortua ipse sit mortuus idhaerere the scripture is a dead letter the spirit quickens who but he thats dead will adhere to a dead letter as his rule brings in himself weakly answering thus viz to go round again to the confounding of all his own former sayings that the letter is dead falsissima est ista assertio scriptura est verbum dei quod vivum est et efficax ne{que uspiam litera esse mortua dicitur i.e
that's a most false assertion the scripture is that word of god which is living and efficacious neither quoth he trapezuntius like who forgot his own name forgetting its the name of i.os own imposing in the same book is the letter any where at all said to be dead
os rounds and contradictions to himselfe about the hebrew punctation

moreover as to hebrew ponts capers about quavers up and down and runs round like a blind horse in a mill one while asserting them coavo'us with the consonants of such necessity that without the owning of these to be of divine original men are left which is as much as to say all the iewish church were so left from moses to ezra if the points were added but by ezra and his companions and not by moses at the first writing unto great uncertainty in all translations and expositions of the scripture
that who owns them not as so and are otherwise minded then those who maintain the antiquity of the vowels and accents so as that the hebrew language was written with them from the beginning not only make doubtfull the authority of the scriptures but even pluck it up by the roots sith without the vowels and notes of distinction it hath nothing firm and certain
that he that reads it without points as the church did before ezra if ezra was the first author of them is as one that rides a horse without a bridle that may be carried he knows not wither whereupon relating the opinion of radulph cevall to be that the hebrew language was plainly written with them from the beginning this mans judgement quoth

is also mine yea
he makes the foundation of all questionable upon the supposition of the novelty of the hebrew points insinuating it as a just consequence which great and wise men suppose naturally and necessarily flows from the opinion of the novelty of the vowels and from the state of the hebrew language and bible unpointed

otherwhiles notwithstanding not knowing whether he had best assert them to be so ancient or no he to go round again at first faces halse about and leaves those who held them up as high as moses to prove it saying only he shall not oppose them that maintain the points coaevous with the letters and yet after a while does no less in effect then face quite round about and oppose them in the same sentence by this confident assertion viz
no wayes but as we now enjoy them we shall manifest that they were compleated by undefined span alphabet the men of the great synagogue ezra and his companions
and
pleading against such as hold them to be more novel and of no higher invention then from the tiberian missorites on his own and their behalf who affirm ezra and his companions to have been the authors of the points he sayes their sayings whom he opposes cast a probability that ezra laying aside the old letters because of their difficulty together with the new introduced the points to facilitate their use which if so then he leaves all ages of the jewish before ezra even the true saints meerly for want of the hebrew vowels and accents as men riding horses without bridles who were carried they knew not whether but so the saints then were not and though the generality of the iews were yet twas not because they had no vowels accents and points to attend to as their guides though am of os mind tis like they then and till ezra's days had none but because they refused to be led by the light within and guided by the holy spirit which for all their attendance to the letter they as stephen said acts
had allwayes resisted
thus to the contradiction of his first· selfe is run round down the hill from moses as low as esdras about his punctilio's and hebrew points but there he reckons to stand and keep his ground against all that come against him to bring him and his ancient rich possession of pins and points any lower or at least so low as the tiberian missorites and here he fights like a man in a or frensie left all be for ever lost if he can't make it uncontroleably manifest that the points are better guides then may be expected from such bad men as the tiberian massorites and first to make that good to the begetting of an infallible and divine faith of the points divine original and not such a humane one as they must have if from the massorites that these charecters the hebrew points mark as we have them are not to be ascribed to the massorites as their authors he does not more make severall silly consequences then he does himself confound them even as fast as he makes them

first not to meddle here with those many paedantick proofs and put offs which have elsewhere viz in the exer of my book call'd the country correcting the university sufficiently already disproved he treats it out throw a great part of his two treatises with no other tool then that toy of tradition or a taedious vain uncertain talking of some learned humanists iews and christians in proof of the points original before the massorites against

other some full as as the other and in an extravagant way argles against the arguments urged by not only learned iews and iesuites elias levita bellarminus but also confessedly learned protestants luther zwinglius prideaux against his pretended antiquity of the points from ezra vagarying abroad unreasonably in the high road of forgeries and fables then which as he sayes himself
in nothing more hath the world been cheated answering conjecture with no more then conjecture laying about him like a thatcher thawcking author upon author story upon story tittle upon tattle fancy upon fancy humane fallible persuasion against humane fallible perswasion and yet in his conclusion not only shooting a thousand years short of moses from whom he would at first have drawn them but also not adventuring to vent himself about their compleat being and beginning from ezra at any certainty or clearly but thus cloudily only viz let any man judge whether from such a heap of uncertainties any thing can arise that may be admitted to give testimony in the cause in hand and so say either for or against on one side or tother for quod utrobi{que incertum est non est vel hinc vel illinc certum whats uncertain between two concludes nothing either way for certain and so he falls as short of making it evident that they were first from ezra as they do who say they were at first from the massorites or iewish rabbins but suppose his argument from the tradition of some men had been as tis not from all men downwards nemine contradicente none to vye with the rest if he go about thereby to manifest as he does the undoubtednesse of his consequence and conclusion yet he hath confounded it himself if no other man had ever stirred against the businesse whilest to go romnd again he tells us
the constant tradition of more then a thousand years carried on by innumerable multitudes of men great wise and sober from one generation to another doth but set open the gates of hell for mahumetans as well to prove the goodnesse of their alcoran and
because this tradition is pretended with great confidence as a sure bottome foundation for receiving of the scriptures in effect so tis say by for the receiving the points from ezra not the massorites and that not without the tradition of as learned to vye with the reporters shall quoth he a little further inquire into it
tradition which is report of men from those who are gone before may be either of all men of the world or only of some of them if of all either their suffrages must be taken in some convention or gathered up from the individuals as we are able and have opportunity if the first way of receiving them were possible which is the utmost improvement that imagination can give the authority inquired after yet every individual of men being a lyar the whole convention must be of the same complexion and so not be able to yield a sufficient basis to build a faith upon cui non potest subesse falsum that is infallible and cannot possibly be deceived much lesse is there any foundation for it in such a report as is the emergency of the assertion of individuals

thus with the whirlwind of his own round about doctrine layes all his long traditionary tales for the antiquity of his tittles on the ground again with his own talk of the invalidity of tradition to beget such a divine infallible faith and certainty as men must have about the scripture which he makes the rule basis and foundation of all faith and certainty in other things so

diruit aedificat mutat quadrata rotundis

secondly treats out two more arguments for the antiquity and divinity of his tittles whereof if no man should intermeddle to confute them the one confounds and utterly overturns the other

the first whereby alas poor man he hampers himself and to as little effect most horribly to evince the points to be as high as ezra at least which salves not his assertion of the texts integrity however were it granted him and not so novel an invention as of the tiberian massorites is an extraordinary excentrick boundlesly bitter invective as against the iewes in general in their rancor against christ wickedly attempting the restoration of their religion under barchochab and rabbi iuda by the compiling of their talmuds and much other inpertinent stuffe and story of which himself very truly confesses in verba that its all nothing to his own purpose so specially against the tiberian massorites in particular the supposed authors of the hebrew pun ation for half a hundred pages together not caring how he vilifies them so he may but bring men to beleeve so badly of them as not to own them as the inventors of the vowels and accents but ezra or some holy men guided therein at least by the infallible direction of the holy spirit his argument which he hath from dr lightfoot drawn close up out of
in form is on this wise the pointing of the bible savours of the work of the holy spirit not of wicked blind but the tiberian massorites were wicked blind mad men possessors of the letter without the spirit desperately engaged to oppose the truth under gods curse one of whose fundamentals was opposition to the gospel feeding themselves with vain fables

and mischievaus devices against the gospel labouring to set up a new religion under the name of the old in despite of god so striving to wrestle it out with his curse to the utmost men of a profound ignorance in all learning and knowledge but what concerns their own dunghill traditions and innumerable fopperies addicted to such monstrous fopperies as their successors in after ages are asham'd of and seek to palliate what they are able idolaters crafty raging serious in nothing childish about serious things how much deceitfulness froth venome smoak nothing in their disputations therefore considering the importance of the hebrew vowels and accents to a right understanding of the scripture we need clear yea undeniable unquestionable evidence and testimony and so say there is as clear and unquestionable given this way as who is concerned to give infallible proof his way gives to the contrary to prove the rise and spring of the points to be from these men that is the tiberian massorites

this is one of os arguments which how it lacks little confutation by any thing but its own apparent folly and evident weaknesse and blindnesse a child may see it intimates as if wicked men could not possibly find out and affix such a thing as the figure of accents vowels and points to facilitate to themselves the reading of any character whatsoever as if it must be some more then divine and supernatural work to devise the shape of the hebrew vowels more then tis for the greek or english or others to devise theirs whereas if had not for hast run himself out of the remembrance of things that are so obvious and ordinary that none but ignoramus and trapezuntius

himself could easily forget them what more common and frequent then for men that are ignorant and enmity against god to have the skill and faculty of inventing not only tittles accents points and vowels but also letters consonants and characters figures and those of diverse sorts and shapes long and short hand to expresse themselves by in writing and printing in their respective native languages trow who invented undefined span alphabet and our a undefined span alphabet at oi eu ou and the several kinds of figures for different sounds and what nation hath not some of that wit that england hath so much of as to find out many sorts of chirography and brachography for their own conveniences and who invented first that so great so skilful so useful and eminent work of typography it selfe so many exact wayes of cutting and setting and stamping so many different characters of all languages might it not be done by men who heeded not the inspirations of the spirit by men moved meerly with love of mony and hope of gain in which way the bible comes out lyable to the common fate of all other books as to matter of falsification by misprinting how many differing characters and sorts and sizes of letters of greek hebrew english are and have our bibles themselves been written and printed in and doth not himself
tell us of an universal character attempted by diverse and ready to be brought forth by his dr wilkz ward whereby to expresse all his apert simple and double sounds vowels and dipthongs which says will doubtlesse give universal satisfaction to learned and prudent men when he shall communicate his thoughts on it and yet denyes wilkins ward or any man else in these dayes to be inspired or guided by the infallible spirit

how worthlesse and frivolous then what childishnesse lightnesse what froth smoake nothing are the thoughts of and his dr lightfoot whom he there cites
who can scarce beleeve it possible that the points should hominem sapere proceed from such a school as the tiberian university or savour of the work of any humanists or wicked men or of any other then the spirit of god but if this argument of had any such force in it as were worth reselling as indeed it hath not yet if we should say nothing to it
backs it with another so strongly that he breaks the very back of this so that it can bear nothing of the burden he layes on it nor be of the least import whilest after all his talk of the wickednesse of these men in proof of their unfitnesse and unlikelinesse to be the authors of such a businesse as the points least this should fail to go round again still he adds this as another argument thereof viz the likelinesse of it that there were never any such men as these massorites in the world at all

so odde and antick is os extream eagernesse in driving on his design against them that talk of the tiberians as the authors of his superlatively prized points that rather then any should imagine those men to have invented them he streins and stretches his twatling strings so far as not to deny but own tell us
that there was an university and school of such tiberians and so describes the men who and what they were and when they liv'd viz after the finishing of the last talmud
only that they were men so and so and so ill mannered and qualified magicians and what not that's evill as not likely to be inventers of so rare a businesse as vowels

and accents
secondly lest all this should not be of force enough next by a denyall of it to fright souls into a faith and fancy that there were never any such men in the world at all to which purpose he uses such suppositive doubtful negative expressions concerning it as whereby to cause it to become questionable and render it doubtfull whether there ever were any such or nay men they were quoth he if any such were who were so and so

and
of all the fables that are in the talmud know more incredible than this story quoth he that men who cannot any story mark he sayes it appears not by any story there were such and yet in the very line above sayes tis a story in the talmud was there ever any man found so confounding in a treatise and so ready in this work of running the rounds or other record be made to appear that they ever were in rerum natura not observed not taken notice of by any learned man iew or christian should find out so great so excellent a work

to which say that though of all the contradictions that gives to himself this is not the first nor greatest nor clearest to say as he does

that learned dr lightfoot observes and takes notice of the university and school at tiberias and of the doctors among the tiberians by name out of the talmud viz iuda chamina chsija barba iochannan ionathan and the rest of the gemarists and of whom sayes the jewes generally beleeve not only that there were such men but also that the points had a reviving by them according to the observation and notice of azarias and yet to say as he does that it cannot be made to appear by any story or other record that ever there were such and that they are unobserved and not taken notice of by any learned man iew or christian yet of all the ridiculous passages that are in the talmudical treatise of this is not the least not to say the most incredible that men of whom it cannot by any story or other record be made to appear that they ever were in rerum natura should according to or by os strange story of them be made to appear to any reasonable man to be idolaters magicians wicked blind and mad men surely they must first appear and be observed to be in rerum naturâ before they can to or by any save such blind seers as can see nothing at all better then they can see things as they are appear be observed much more described by name to be in natura hominum improboru and if any man beleeve with that those men can appear to him to be wicked men
in esse cognoscibili who cannot be made to appear at all that they ever were at all in essereali il'e give them leave to upraid me with thou of little faith wherefore dost thou doubt it for my beleevable faculty is indeed too narrow to entertain or contain that self gainsaying story for a truth credat apella he that can beleeve it let him am an infidel as to that foolish figment and if these two contrary tales can be both true my reason can't reach the reason of these

but among the numerous odd passages that passe from in this point about the proof of the points antiquity that which is yet more observable as to my present purpose is that when he hath roled sysiphus his stone a great while pervenire ad summum to get up to the top to prove the pedigree of his punctation as high as moses if it might be if not from ezra at least seeing

he could not hold it up in the utmost hight nor carry it clearly into a coaevousnesse with the scripture according to the strictnesse of his position condescends to come down by the rounds of his ladder half way first to the dayes of ezra and in the prosecution of his undertaking to manifest it as at first he makes no doubt to do that they were compleated by ezra and his companions finding himself uncapable to carry the matter against such as derive their descent from the iudaical rabbins or tiberian maslorites clearly up so high as ezra but only cloudily by foisting flinging and casting out at least but forgery against forgery fable against fable and a heap of uncertainties against the heap of uncertainties of others for so he will needs call the most cogent and more then probable evidences of all his confessedly learned antagonists elias capellus luther prideaux
though his own pleas considerations repulses and replyes are in the eyes of all impartial ones suppose should say but as twere enough ad hominem to impeach his position of utter falshood though might say more uncertain at last he sinks down by the rounds as low as the massorites dayes and so per force by little and little yeilds up as far as is demanded from him assenting with azarias
that the iews generally beleeve these points to have been from moses at least from ezra not denying that the use and knowledge of them received a great reviving by the gemarists and massorites when they had been much dissused and
with the same azarias ascribing them as to their virtue and force to moses or god on as to their figure and character to ezra as to the restauration of their use unto the massorites in which he hath come quite round with much ado and granted enough to prejudice his own position to the utter overthrow of the truth thereof for as to the virtue and force none can deny them to be coaevous with the hebrew language it selfe but tis the figure and character only the question is about and that is yeelded to be but from ezra and since ezra to have been much dissused but to have received their great reviving and restoration to the use they now stand in which is the thing pleaded for against from the massorites and so howbeit makes no doubt
but to manifest it that they were as we now enjoy them compleated by ezra and his companions yet instead thereof he hath confessed in effect that as we now enjoy them since last dissused they were revived restored and compleated by the massorites whom he disclaims as having any hand in them
there remain sundry more and rounds runs in about the points of which for a tast take one more here though touched on elsewhere and then sar aquod suffocat as more then enough from so enough from me as to that point of the hebrew punctation
shall manifest quoth that its fit they i.e the points should be all taken out of the if they have the original assigned to them by the prolegomena i.e from the massorites yet
grant quoth the points to have the original pretended yet to go round again they deserve all regard and are of singular use for the right understanding of the scripture so that its not lawfull to depart from them without urgent necessity yet to go round again and face quite about as ye were professe quoth if could be throwly convinced that the present hebrew punctation were the figment and invention of those men i.e the massorites should labour to the utmost to have it utterly taken away

out of the bible nor should in its present station make use of it any more to have it placed in the bible as so great a part of the word of god is not tolerable

contradictions and rounds of about the manner of the first giving out of the scripture

the word the scriptures quoth come forth mark unto us from god without the least mixture or interveniency of any medium obnoxious to fallibillity as is the wisdome truth integrity knowledge memory of the best of all men or capable of giving change or alteration to the least iota or syllable yet to go round again we live quoth many yeares from the last person who received any part of the scripture from god have not received it immediately from god
so speaking of the first pen men of the scripture their tongue quoth i.o in what they spake or their hand in what they wrote was no more at their own disposall then the pen is in the hand of an expert writer
yet to go round againe their mind quoth and understanding was used in the choyce of words for they did use undefined span alphabet words of choyce
yet ex

verba disposita sunt per spiritum sanctum neqt ad exprimendum sensum quem ipsi de mente et voluntate den conceperunt ingenio ac arbitrio ipsorum scriptorum sunt permissa aut relicta to go round about as ye were the words were at the disposall of the holy spirit neither to expresse the sense they conceived of the mind and will of god were they left to the dispose arbitriment will or choyce of the writers themselves

finally as so abundantly as is above shewed contradicts and confounds himself in many matters about the scriptures or outward text so about the sence and meaning of one text of the scripture wherein they all disagree with the qua like ishmaels is against all his fellows hands every of his fellow fighters hands whom have here to do with who from the same text sence against the quakers is against him to the confounding of him which text is ioh
where the true light is said to enlighten every man coming into the world for howbeit cloudily concludes with all the other three viz t.d r.b i.t in concluding and crouding that most universall terme undefined span alphabet every man within the little compasse and narrow corner of his wheel in a wheel
the elect men only saying synagogically with the rest hoc est syncategorema istud omnis non absolute sed relate ad electos dicitur this is the consignification of that term its meant not absolutely but relatively to the elect yet when he sayes non dicitur christum illuminare omnem hominent venientem in mundum sed quod ipse veniens in mundum omnem hominem illuminat christ is not said to enlighten every man that comes into the world but that becoming into the world lighteneth every man and that this is the sence of those words the falsenesse silliness of which sence the insufficiency nothingness of it also to serve his turn against the qua if granted him have shewed in the book it self to which this is but an appendix here not only each of his three friends forsake him for t.d himself among all his many meanings meddles not with this but two of them viz i.t and r.b who backs i.ts
book make bold to fight against him for it as well as the qua do witnesse their words
there is a doubt whether it should be read thus that was the true light coming into the world which inlightneth every man by a trajection or as ours read it as the words are placed that was the true light which inlightneth

every men which cometh into the world
grotius after cyrill and austin and some others see how the divines are divided and the founders confounded among themselves likes the former as best but first such trajection disordering the words
the phrase being as fitly interpreted of birth as of appearing as a teacher rather chuse the reading of our translators and
they tell us over again how coming into the world here is related to every man coming and not to christs coming into it and how they before gave reasons against os sence

so having been walking the rounds with these men to give the world a review of the riddles they are wrapt in and the manifold contradictions they are by the network of their own hands snared catcht and tangled in about their letter till am come with them to that main text at which they leave me because it talks so plainly of the true light which they love not and leave them to dance about still in the darknesse of their own divinations proceed in the light in which see them though they being out of it see not themselves to open briefly to all people who love not to live with them rather in their darknesse then in christs light the mist of darknesss wherein they mope about and dance the rounds in their discourses about the light in their fiery fluttering against which the wicked now is as he ever was snared in the work of his own hands psal
higgaion selah consider and note it

contradictions absurdities and rounds concerning the light in the conscience which the qua testifie to
as concerning the true light or gift of gods grace in every man the four men aforesaid do as all their fellowes do uno ore babble somwhat about it and bear witnesse either for or against it but each mans witness agrees no better together within it self then that they give about the other matters abovesaid
somtimes they call it light truly really naturally and properly so and not metaphorically nor by way of allusion to what is so witnesse
it is spirituall morall intellectuall light that hath the preheminence as to a participation of the nature and properties of light
otherwhiles the same who excluded it from the name of metaphoricall by that of naturall and proper to go round again do conclude it to be metaphoricall as in opposition contradistinction to both naturall and proper witnesse who confounds his own foresaid saying
with another division ex

where under that same term of metaphoricall he distinguishes that light he calls morall spiritual intellectuall as respecting and exercising mens minds whether in matters morall civill or spirituall from that which respects bodily sight which he call'd naturall and proper

somtimes they call this very light whereby duties and divine things are discerned universall and common to all as the qua do in some measure though not to all in the same but when so then no other but naturall as in opposition to supernaturall and spirituall witnesse t.d pamp
naturall and supernaturall light are two an though all have the one yet few the other and ex
lumen internum omnibus commune naturale est
the light within common to all is naturall and to be called so
if this light that is common

be not naturall the very intellect is not naturall
so
concessimus reliquias primavae lucis esse in omnibus sed eas esse spirituales id pernegamus some relicks of the primitive light we grant to be in all but deny these to be spirituall nihil non naturale nihil spirituale communicatum nothing but what's naturall nothing thats spirituall is common or communicated to all so also bax tom
a naturall light from christ is yielded to be in every man pag

otherwhiles this very universall light in all which before was said to be not supernaturall or spirituall but meerly naturall to go round again is by these men yielded to be at least more then naturall and so no lesse according to ds division of light into two then supernaturall and spirituall witnesse against themselves r.b i.t
it can hardly be avouched that that knowledge in morality and divinity which they people that never had the law nor gospell made known to them as the jewes and christians have had attained to was by meer light of nature and in baxters epistle
he tells us of a common supernaturall light given to the unsanctified
might also call in iohn horn and the two thomas moores that push with him against the truth as witnesses of the same confusion that is among all the priests in this matter who in their book stiled a fuller discovery
affirm the light wherewith christ lighteth every man is both naturall and spirituall but as my businesse lyes mainly with the other four men so george whitehead hath sufficienly thrust down the vain thoughts already of those three in his book stil'd the hee goats horn broken so let them passe
witnesse also who though he together with i.o
nor doth it in the least impair this self evidencing efficacy of the scripture that it is a morall and spirituall not a naturall light owns the scripture specially the light in the scripture or holy matter contained in the scripture to be a morall spirituall supernaturall and not a naturall rule or light yet affirms it to be common or universall in some measure in the hearts of all even the very heathen
pamp
the matter contained in the scripture quoth he is a rule to all men so far as tis revealed to them and was so before twas put into writing and so much of it as is written upon the hearts of the heathens is a rule to them rom
thus who before made the one light to be two viz naturall and supernaturall here to go round again makes that light which is in the scriptures and in the heathens hearts rom
truly one and the same and no lesse then supernaturall and spirituall witnesse also who calls the light often naturall yet to go round again ex

splits this one light which they all somtimes falsly call no more then naturall into a light which is both naturall civill supernaturall and spirituall as it were all at once this light quoth he or faculty of understanding so he foolishly calls it splits it self into meerly naturall

and civill and supernaturall spirituall which discerns spirituall matters and all things in order to the last end and this inward spirituall light quoth he or faculty of understanding spirituall things spiritually is various
where note how falsely calls the light no

other then the faculty of understanding which he calls elsewhere truly enough but naturall and yet to go round again calls the very faculty of understanding which is common to all men as men by the title of this inward spirituall light which discerns spirituell things and that spiritually in order to the supernaturall and ultimate end salvation
and this inward spirituall light common to all that discerns spirituall things spiritually in order to that ultimate end sayes is various too and very well he may if it may be divided again into those two severall sorts into which i.o it for whereas here he calls this light in the conscience which the qua call to lumen internum spirituale
an inward spirituall light which discerns spirituall things spiritually in order to the supernaturall spirituall and ultimate end yet a little lower viz to go round again he calls it meer darknesse it self by which no divine saving thing can be seen witnesse his words

this light within common to all however attended to is quoth he in no respect saving but in all divine matters so far as to the ultimate end meer darknesse and blindnesse

one while again they deny this light to be the visive i.e intellective faculty or eye of the soul or to be given for any such end as so much as to remove the defect of the visive faculty witnesse i.o
light will not remove the defect of the visive faculty light is not eyes
otherwhiles to go round again it is the very visive faculty as ex

this light or faculty of understanding which is meerly naturall
this inward spirituall light or faculty of understanding spirituall things spiritually
so

lux quae proprie mentem respicit seu facultas illa intelligendi est undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet oculus acies mentis the light which properly respects the mind or the faculty of the understanding is the sight the visive force the very eye of the mind
one while they tell us that its true among the gentile philosophers there was light that guided well and that in the law there was light and that no light that is truly such though dimene and imperfect as say they that of the philosophers and the law was is to be rejected witnesse r.b i.t

otherwhiles some light yea even the philosophers light which led them well as they say asore in some did in most things lead men into crooked and dangerous wayes therefore unlesse men love and it be best to be led into crooked and dangerous wayes to go round again to be rejected witnesse against themselves r.b i.t in the self same page the next line but one after the other witnesse also i.o against them both who ex

sayes of the spirit and light within the qua calls to among other things that he calls incerta periculosa inutilia minime necessaria rejicienda at{que detestanda that they are to be both rejected and detested
thus when they begin of their own accord among their own supposed friends somtimes these men commend

and extoll and call men to heed this light in the conscience which the qua call to so eminently that the qua scarce need more words to recommend it to men in as to its excellency divinity usefullnesse profitablenesse needfullnesse and necessity to be heeded and obeyed then the same which our divines themselves who hate it do seem to set it out in

otherwhiles that is when any qua begin to call men to it to commend and extoll it among their parish people though in their own forms of speech about it and when the qua desire them as they will prove themselves true ministers of christ with paul to labour to turn all men to the light within themselves then to go round again either they'l be silent or if they sing anything at all concerning it sing out no more so loudly as before to the praise and glory of it but rathe what they are able they sing their old new song to the turncoats tune of truth turned out of doores in way of dispraise and disparagement and utter detestation of it to the utmost as if twere the vilest kind of canting in the whole world to utter one word in order to the begetting of any people into so much as any measure of any good opinion at all of a light within so that may truly say of these seers as the poet once of one of caesars singers

omnibus hoc vitium est cantoribus inter amicos vt nunquam inducunt animum cantare rogati injussi nunquam desistunt

to shew the world how sepharically these ministers sing out the high praises of the light of christ the light of the world the light in the conscience when they please to begin of themselves· and to go round again how symphonically they set it at their heels in opposition to the qua rather then the qua shall prevail with them to say any thing of it that is any better then nought shall hereunder shew both their voluntary calls to and commendations of their unjustly occasioned cautions about condemnations of this light of christ in the conscience of men when the qua commend and call to it and set the one of these immediately under the other only premising this that whether they speak of the light which themselves call christ which the letter holds sorth and testifies to or the light wherewith god shines and shews his will and mind in some measure in the hearts and minds of all men even heathen philosophers or others which we call christs light though they do not we mean however they divide these no other but that one law of god which the letter is the copy of which is spirituall holy just and good which confesses to be the heathens rule so far as is written in their hearts
christ the light of the world and his light in the heart which the scripture testifies of abundantly not any such thing as mans own thoughts wisdome imaginations inventions
which the heathen became vain in rom
which the qua call all men out of and the divines that lead men by no other are themselves yet led by more then any steering by nothing but their own many minds and meanings on the scripture
some few calls to and commendations of the light with cautions to take heed to it collected out of many more that are in and his book


it concerns us say they to take heed how we dote on our own

reason or the most exact writers of morality and neglect the light which christ hath brought into the world let us be wise so to use candles as not to burn that we so make use of all the reason humane wisdome and virtue we have our selves or discern in others writings or examples that yet we chiefly eye and follow the grand light the sun of righteousness the lord jesus learning him by studying the great counsell of god which he revealed and denying our selves take up our crosse and follow him as his disciples christ is to be chosen and followed as our light an exhortation to use christ as our light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world be induced to imbrace and follow the lord christ as the great light of the world besides the evidence out of scripture to prove him to be sent from god a light into the world
his sayings and doings do amply confirm it

and
they go on thus

though the jewes contradicted and blasphemed the romane emperour raged lucian jeered libanism wrangled iulian calumniated papists corrupt gnosticks hereticks fanaticks quakers here they abominably bely the truth for the quakers call all and only to the light of christ adulterate and cloud the truth of christ they do but pisse against the sun the light of christs doctrine the truth of the gospell doth and will shine forth nor can all the cavills say they of moderne atheists or the dust raised by new phantasticks take away the brightnesse of christs light or hinder its enlightning others then themselves and shall we after all the arguments given of christs being the true light follow after ignes fatuos who these be but that fraternity who would have men follow their fancies and not christs light in the conscience which is that the quakers call to know not what reall comfort or spirituall help to holinesse or heavenly directions do they give to lead men to god better then christ hath done may you not discern a vain glorious spirit a proud carnall spirit in them what do their censures of others shew but a mind to extoll themselves their affected speech looks carriage but a desire to hide their falshood what do all the devices of iesuits popes and their agents tend to but either by force or subtlety to set up the monstrous powers of the man of sin and their own domineerlng over mens consciences underhim recte quidem sed et etiam de te fabula parochialis sacerdos what is in their conclave but pollicy in their counsell but deceit in their iesuists and casuists but jugglihg shall we go after such masters and leave christ remember we that one is our master even christ when any shall sollicit us not to adhere to christ as our teacher reject them christ hath warned you say they and so say too as concerning any that lead forth from his light within therefore saith he go not forth after them nor follow them if any say low here is christ or there and so do all priests and professors and their teachers in their sundry forms and outward observations in which they look for the kingdome which comes not in them believe it not
we will not venture our lives upon mountebanks and will we our souls upon deceivers shall we follow our own conceits which often prove foolish and neglect christs doctrine which say we still is his teaching light and counsell in the conscience which alwayes proves wise and safe no no let us answer as peter lord to

whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternall life

alas what can we expect but if we follow blind leaders as all are that teach the things of god otherwise then christ and his apostles did who say called all along to walk in the light within we should fall with them into the ditch into everlasting perdition on the otherside there is so much plain and clear light in christs doctrine as will guide our feet in the way of peace away then with all such obtruded insinuating teachers as indeavour to hide from us the light of christ shining in his doctrine recorded in scripture let's say none but christ none but christ that christ which preached dyed at ierusalem that word of his which is written in my bible of which the bible testifies say that its near in the heart to heare and do it shall be my light to the testimony of jesus which sayes tho scripture is the spirit of prophecy the sure word of prophecy that as a light shineth in the dark place of the heart and is to be taken heed to to his everlasting gospell stick

so bixt
ep
speaking of the qua do they affirm that all men have the light of reason who denyeth it of any but idiots and infants do they maintain that this light is from iesus christ both as the authour and restorer of nature and by whom among us is this denyed do they say that repaired or reprived nature may be fitly called grace about this also we have no mind to quarrell with them so they will not exclude supernaturall grace thereby as we do not but hereby conclude it do they hold that common supernaturall light is given to many at least of the unsanctified and who contradicteth them in this do they hold that as the sun is appointed in nature to be the light of every man that cometh into the world though shutting our eyes may exclude it so christ is by office the sun in the world of grace giving men actually all the gracious light they have being sufficient himself to enlighten all and giving them an illuminating word which is sufficient in its own kind to do its own part though many are blind and for their sin are deprived of the communication of this light why all this we maintain as well as they do they say that all this light within us and without us is to be hearkened to and obeyed why what man did they ever speak with that's a christian no christians indeed say but too many antichristians that denyeth it

see what a deal of the quakers doctrine concerning learning only at christs light is here uttered by these men r.b i.t who yet hate the self same doctrine at their hearts when the quakers teach it also in many other places they teach much more to the same purpose putting men on to attendance to the light yea even the light within every man as
this light usefull for two ends first to restrain men from excesse of sin
as he gave a law to the iewes because of transgression to restrain them or abate punishments so to other people he gave a law in themselves to prevent the extirpation of the nations by bridling them in their lusts thorow conscience of sin and fear of punishment
secondly besides this god hath another end that they might be inexcusable who sinned against the light in them and god justified in his sentence and judgment upon them

observe how this light within is owned by them as the law of god which t.d affirming the work of the law only to be there

yet denyes to be in the heathens hearts to the contradiction of these men and of himself also in that other plaee
pamp
where to go round again he confesses much of the holy matter of the scripture to be written upon the hearts of the heathens and that to be their rule say as the law of god which is spirituall holy just and good and to be obeyed for else transgression of it could not be sin deserving judgment for sin is no other then the transgression of the law

so
they go on thus if the light shine into thy soul from christ so as any convictions or discoveryes of truth from christ get into thee and some convictions they confesse all by the light within take heed thou hold it not in unrighteousnesse nor seek to quench it rom
wrath to all that hold truth in unrighteousnesse when lust imprisons light no entrance for the light of christ into that soul there must be a love of the light its the greatest sign of a man willfully evill when he hates the light and its a good sign of a man truly good when he can delight in that light mork which discovers his own euills

what light is that which discovers a mans own evills but the light within the letter without doth de jure only the light within doth de facto discover mens own evill christ hath determined this to be the great condemnation that men love darknesse rather then light or else the heathen could not be condemned say who have and yet hate the light within for they have no letter without for thats the sign they side with the prince of darknesse and men that do truth come to the light that their deeds may be manifest
the more light is rejected the more purely voluntary any sin is when men are willingly ignorant they are incurably evill
each person is to make their use of the light within him so far as it is light and usefull
certainly it concerns every man so far as to look to the light within him mark that he do not as tis said of some job
rebell against the light which text in iob interprets of the letter but to the confutation of truly with us of the common light within men a mens conscience is so far a law to him that though it cannot of it self justifie which is contrary to rom
which sayes their inward thought as well excuses the heathen when they do well as accuses when they do ill and excusation and justification or to excuse clear justifie are all one yet it may condemn him

so
they go on thus god hath imprinted in all even the most barbarous people some relique of light though in some it is so small that may be say we for all have not the same but all some measure of gods light which these men somtimes call darknesse delusive and dangerous and degrees vary not the nature of the case that it can hardly be perceived whether there be any sense of sin or wrath of duty or reward of god or devill heaven or hell
secondly some people that never had the gospell nor the law made known to them as the jewes and christians have had yet have attained to so much knowledge and practice of morall duties

mark morall duties are the main things of the law and required in the morall law viz
to do as we would be done by which faith christ is the law and prophets math


the sum substance and upshot of all and more then all offering and sacrifice so that the iews failing in these weightiar matters viz iudgment mercy faith all outward oblations and observations were abhorred that in some acts of righteousnesse temperance chastity fidelity and such vertues they have equallized at

least in respect of their outward demeanour toward men if not exceeded not only iewes who had the scripture as our scribes have and search as much in it but also the more shame for the most of you filthy fruitlesse faithlesse christians the while whom very heathens will therefore judge the most christians thirdly and in the knowledge of god though therein they were most defective yet they attained to so much knowledge and right apprehension of him as enabled them to correct the vulgar errours concerning god

see how far beyond our vulgar christians and very christian clergy men that have the letter to boast talk trade on the light within hath led the very ethnicks that have heeded it by these mens own confession but they go on yet further preaching up the light with the qua thus
it will concern those who own

christ as their light to judge themselves and their wayes by his light this act of self judgment is within faith i.o seconding that morall instinct of good and evill that is imprinted by god on the conscience from the innate light therein it is the great benefit of the light that it doth make manifest eph
thus by the light of christ the evill of our wayes is reproved the wayes of god approved now this is no small benefit to have the light to discern our errors which without light from christ we should never have understood a wise christian will be often judging himself by the light of the law discovering his transgressions that needs be the law in the conscience which de facto shewes every mans own sins to himselfe it will be needfull not only to use the light of christ to judge our selves by but also to order our actions by
am the light of the world saith christ he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness
there cannot be unsafe walking by christs light there is no danger when christ our light goes before walk in the light saith christ while ye have the light lest darknesse come upon you how many millions are there of souls perplexed and tortured all their life with fears and doubts for want of walking by the light of christ in scripture which say is that in the conscience which the scripture mainly calls to and chusing rather to walk by a light and sparks of their own kindling alias their own wisdome conceits sences and meanings on the scripture traditions in worship and such like which they call light which in the end either goes quite out or burns so dim as to leave them in darknesse of spirit and horror of conscience and no marveile since such as neglect the word preached which is that word of faith i.e which men are to beleeve in unto life which the scripture testifies and the apostles preached to be nigh in mens hearts to heave and do it should follow the mares of humane reason the examples customes and dictates of men and in conclusion ly down in sorrow isa
such foolish fires will lead to nothing but bogs and precipices but christ the true light when his gospell is followed which is the light in the heart cor
guides the feet of men into the way of peace the light of christ is to be used as our weapons or tools to defend ourselves or to work with let us put off the works of darknesse and put on the armour of light the truth is light is the chiefest instrument for safety and worke if a man be without light he can neither defend himself nor offend an enemy he that would make use of christs light must be armed with his doctrine he that would

improve the light must be a doing the businesse which the word of christ directs him to and to that end it mark must dwell richly in him
make use of the light of christ for thy comfort and rejoycing it is it which removes doubts griefs fears despair in life or death
oh how sweetly might men live how comfortably might they dye if they did make use of it

thus highly do these two men r.b i.t speake of the light of christ within which the qua preach yea that in the very heathen though they oft call it naturall yet they recommend it as that which told the truth to the heathen which they holding in unrighteousnesse were under wrath and without excuse before god because they glorified him not as god but were fill'd with unrighteousnesse and did the things which by that of god in them they knew judgment was due to and that they were worthy of wrath
ignorance of the law being not to be pleaded by them say they who sin against the innate light of their own spirits for as much as that fact must needs be voluntary which is done against the knowledge and judgment of a mans own conscience and yet somtimes to go round again they tell us that when their saints sin through infirmity only as judges david did when he was guilty of murder and adultery which when they doe they act against the knowledge and judgment of their own consciences their facts are not voluntary but altogether yea utterly against their wills yea
they seem to judge themselves much belyed by the qua for denying the light within and set themselves to vindicate themselves from that as a false aspersion as if they were men that do truly own the light within as much as any yea they there make a use of application of their doctrine about the light that enlightneth every man that cometh into the world to justifie themselves against the qua as owners and honourers of the light within and to warn men that they act not against their light within to this purpose we may infer say they a plea for our selves against the unjust accusations of the qua who use to charge publick preachers with denying the light within each man whereas such light is not at all denyed by them each person is to make use of the light within that he do not rebell against the light a mans own conscience is a law to him

this and much more do these men when they are pleased to begin of themselves confesse to the excellent usefullnesse and sing out to the praise of the light of god within each man but if the qua fall in with them in the same work and commend the same light for tis no other but that of christ the qua cry up in the same words with the priests then in enmity against the qua they set themselves to cry it down with as much indignation and detestation as they cryed it up with approbation and high commendation before then to go round again they sing a new song in contempt of it to the time that hereunder followeth inveighing most heavily and bitterly against the quak for this businesse of warning men to take heed to the light within to that of god in their consciences calling both it and them no lesse then all to nought witnesse their clamours against the qua for this very thing in baxt
epist
their i.e the great pretence when they dishonour the scripture and the ministry is to lead men to a light within them and this is their cry in our assemblies and our streets hearken to the light and word within you and the sufficiency of this they clamourously defend
so

they i.e the quakers assert that there is a light in every man sufficient to guide him to god of it self that it is a rule to shew duty and sin that theres no need

of other teaching of man that this is one in all that it is the gospell this is the main prop of the new religion or frenzy of the quak and leads them into pernitious courses

so
a mans own light cry they speaking of that of god in the conscience of all men which somtimes themselves call no lesse then gods law in them which is in them but not of them nor naturall but spirituall holy just and good cannot warrant of it self without the scripture a mans actions to be lawfull which he doth according to that light and yet sayes much of the truth of the scripture is written on the hearts of the heathen and that so much of it as is there written is their rule so by consequence mens rule can't of it self warrant mens actions to be right that are regulated by it oh the rounds of these men yea tomb and baxter blush not in proof of that their lye as boldly as blindly to assert in the same page that paul in his bloody persecutions and sins followed the light within him and counted it his great sin that he had so done though they confesse as before that all light in all men is from god and christ and that the light some of which all men have from god and christ though dim in regard of its small measure gives them to discern sins dutyes and divine attributes and leads them to much of god and more morallity fidellity chastity temperance righteousness which the letter sayes are the fruits of the spirit then most christians have attained to yea so blasphemously seeme they to speak in the same page of the light within which the qua follow and call to which is no other then that of god in men that convinces them of sin as to intimate that men may as the quakers say they do follow the light within them and yet their practice be of the devill the prince and ruler only of the darknesse in men and not from gods spirit yea say they there if following the dictates of a mans own conscience i.e the leadings of the light in it could warrant his actions the most horrid acts of idolaters papists pagans mahometans fanaticks mad men should be free from censure and controul

thus to their own shame confusion and self contradiction who one while speak well of it they speake abominably of the light within as if all the wickednesse that is in the world came to passe by following the light within the conscience the going away from which into mans own vain imaginations and vile inventions into the dark for not taking heed to the of god his light in the heart is the only cause of all abomination without which light shining and mens loving the darknesse and evill deeds which it condemns more then it there could be neither sin as sayes nor condemnation iohn
rom

as to go round again to their own confutation themselves intimate in the very next words
which are thus

if a man do that which he thinks to be evill that is by the lights dictating it so to be in his own conscience as they hinted just before though it were good and lawfull in it selfe it would be sin to him yea that man that doth good against his conscience is hut an hypocrite in so doing though the thing in if self be right and good when a man doth evill which his conscience tells him is so he commits a sin of the highest degree as to him that knowes to do good and doth it not to him it is sin iam
that is sin in an high degree hence great horrour of spirit hath attended them that have omitted good which their conscience told them they should do and much more horrour in them that have done evill against their conscience as in the case of iudas spira and other instances

might be given without which acting against conscience there's neither sin nor horrour say we with john and christ ioh
ioh
but peace as themselves hereunder confesse i.e assurance of gods acceptance acquittance noncondemnation justification

and therefore say they if the qua intended no more then this by bidding men look to the light within them and no more then that do we intend god knows though the blind guides who can't see wood for trees hating us are minded to make men mistake us as miserably as themselves mistake us that men should take heed that they omitted not the good their own consciences told them they ought to do and that they did not the evill their consciences judged to be so we should accept of their warning
surely it will concern you as to look that your conscience be not erroneus as it ever is when and never is say but when it erres from the light of god within it for the heart is a dark place of it self but as the true light shines in it pet


and heeds not that
so when your conscience is rightly informed to follow it and when it goes wrong as it never does say but when it goes from its guide the light yet to suspend the act which it condemns till by the light it come to approve of what it ignorantly condemned if you desire peace it seemes then by these men as well as the qua doctrine that peace is no where to be had but in walking according to the light in the conscience there will say they be no plea to acquit him before god or to quiet his own spirit who proceeds to act according to the light in his own conscience and a sin against the light of nature so they stile that voyce of god in the conscience still is so much the more damnable in that it is against the most irrefragable evidence mark how they somtimes yield the light in the conscience of all to be a far clearer evidence then that of the letter it self and more dangerous to resist in reference to which they somtimes to go round again call the light within but obscure meer darknesse and blindnesse and not so dangerous nor damnable to resist but rather dangerous yea no lesse then damnable to follow he that doubteth say they with paul is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatever is not of faith is sin mark how themselves affirme with paul and us that faith without which nothing is pleasing to god out of which all that's done is damning to be a faith in that light of christ which is in the conscience
wo be to him cry they as we also do who condemns himself in what he allowes and contrariwise say we and paul and consequently themselves happy is he and he only who is not condemned in himself that is by the light in his own conscience in what he allowes

thus absolutely do these somtimes themselves blesse approve and applaud the light which otherwhiles they brawl and bark against when its own children the qua appear to justifie it somtimes to go round again as absurdly do they bolt out bitternesse and blasphemies against that light which forgetting how unawares they confesse the truth to the qua otherwhiles they so eminently applauded as good and of god making it somtimes pernitious dangerous yea in the highest degree damnable to neglect it at othertimes to go round again pernitious dangerous and in the highest degree damnable to attend to it as

among the gentile philosophers there was light but dim no light truly such is to be rejected philosopphers light guided men well in some things yet to go round again in most did lead them into crooked and dangerous wayes which position of these blind guides is such an ignis fatuus such a will with a

wish or whimsicall piece of guidance as they falsly render the light it self to be which they call so as if one and the same light of god should be a safe and sure guide at one time and such a misleading unsafe guide and foolish fire at another as
will lead into nothing but bags praecipices or as if the least measure of the light of god could lead any man into the least measure of iniquity yea somtimes they call this light of god in the conscience which is gods own voyce in nature at least as i.o sayes his law and most immediate counsell to a man no other then mans own counsell way that leads to cursing witnesse

where they say thus to leave a person to his own imagination lust to walk in his own counsell his own way which is all one as to leave him to the light within him is the greatest curse and judgment to a man from god for refusing to hearken to gods voyce
therefore the light within each person is of it self no safe guide and the qua prescribe that to men as their rule which god counts their curse yet to go round again
the light within each person is by creation and inward work of the spirit so to be left to the inward work of the spirit is it seems with these men the greatest curse yet to go round again as before
the qua charge publick preachers with denying the light within each man whereas such light is not at all denyed by them but is acknowledged to be a great benefit to mankind and
it concerns those who own christ as their light to judge themselves and their wayes by his light and the light within is his light witnesse baxt
epist above cited this light is from christ both as the authour and restorer of nature all this light within us and without us is to be hearkened to and obeyed its the greatest benefit of light that it doth make manifest by the light of christ the evill of our wayes is reproved the wayes of god approved we know the righteousness of god and our own unrighteousness this is no small benefit to have light to discern our own errours which without light from christ and his light within say by which only every man knowes de facto what he is we should never have understood a wise christian therefore will be often judging himselfe and self judgment saith is from the light indelebly implanted by god within each mans conscience by the light of the law which law is light saith the letter prov

discovering his transgressions yet to go round again
oh that all that talk of the light within them would follow the light about them light within you whatever the qua tell you will leave you in perplexity when you shall have most need of comfort but to go round again if you believe in the light of christ as its held out to you in the gospell that is the letter with them which letter yet testifies the light of the gospell of christ to be shining from god within mens hearts cor
you shall see the light of life
therefore to go round again be perswaded cry they and so they conclude their book to disclaime the pretended new light within you as your sufficient guide to god and chuse the light of christ from heaven in his gospel to walk by which christ say speaks and shines from heaven to men now no where immediately but in mens hearts and consciences though men write and speak as from him here on earth whom speaking there by his spirit from heaven it's more dangerous to turn away from then from them that speak but on earth and it say they and so say will guide and comfort you surely and sweetly to eternall life

so have shewed how these two children of the night and darknesse an who were wont to bite and tear one another about the tradition of infant baptisme do both concurr in their divinity doings against the qua and the light within to bawl out somthing uno ore against both far better then their joynt talk concurres together within it self and so run the rounds and dance the hay up and down in and out and somtimes round about that the reader of them can hardly discern or find whether they be fuller of concessions to the qua by their confessions to and commendations of the light within or of denyalls contemnings and condemnations of it for at severall times somtimes more expressly somtimes more implicitly they are found in both in a most egregious manner one while as if parturirent montes mightily magnifying the light within for a great way together as if we might warrantably take them to be some trusty friends to it another while minifying vilifying nullifying it into nothing but some blind lump of darknesse like the lizard making many good prints upon it with their in that sandy way wherein they passe and then dashing them all out again with a long bushy tail or tale of it to the contrary like the blind night flying and fluttering up into the air with a mighty humming noyse of encomiums about it and then dropping down into a piece of cow dung as the devill serv'd him who is the author of it who after he had set him upon the highest pinnacle of the temple he would fain have thrown down thence to destruction so deal these by the inward light or word of gods speaking in the heart which after in words they with have magnified over all gods name they thrust it down as he does below every name yea and every thing almost that hath any name at all and as after in a sound of words they have set it out as glorious next to god as the sun in its brightnesse render it under many reviling opprobrious titles well nigh as odious as satan himself in his princely and their own priestly blindnesse so that which side soever of those two sides and sorts of sayings or double tongu'd talk of the light the truth stands on yet unlesse contradictories can it's certain all cannot be true which they utter of it and if the worst should be true as absit blasphemia far be it from any good man to beleeve their blasphemies of it are then the best is false and that at best proves themselves no better then but if the best they say of it be true as most true it is then and till they both repent in dust and ashes before the lord for their sin in belying his light can expect no better from him then what is due to all blind truth blasphemers

as for he sayes the least of all these four in contradiction to himself about the light howbeit as is above shewed not so little but that its seen that eodem cum illis haeret luto he sticks in the same quagmire together with them but as for i.o he is more over head and eares in it as to this poynt then all the rest
shall only take two or three more turns upon that wheel of his on which he is unwearied in running round and so make an end with them altogether at this time

and first let us see what saith by way of concession to us against himself about the light in all mens consciences
first tr


he writeth thus viz

god declares his soveraign power and authority righteousness and holinesse by the innate or ingrafted light of nature and principles of the consciences of men
that indispensible morall obedience which he requireth

of us as his creatures subject to his law is in general thus made known unto us then citing and writing out at large that text rom
for the gentiles he goes on thus by the light which god hath indelibly implanted in the minds of men accompanyed with a morall instinct of good and evill seconded by that self judgment which he hath placed in us in reference to his own over us he doth reveale himself unto the sons of men and that we may know and be ascertained that this thing is no deceivable pretence but that god doth so indeed reveale himself thereby he adds

the voice of god in nature is effectuall it declares it self to be from god by its own light and authority
there is no need to convince a man by substantiall witnesses that what his conscience speaks it speaks from god whether it bear testimony to the being righteousness power omniscience or holiness of god himself or whether it call for that morall obedience which is eternally and due to him and so shewes forth the work of the law in the heart it so speaks declares it self that without further evidence or reasoning without the advantage of any considerations but what are by it self supplyed and then without an outward ministry letter or writing surely or if it did not yet the letter without that came from the light within is of the lights own supplying it discovers its author from whom it is and in whose name it speaks undefined span alphabet those common notions and generall presumptions of him his authority that are inlayed in the natures of rationall creatures by the hand of god to this end that they might make a revelation of him as to the purposes mentioned are able to plead their divine original without the least contribution of strength or assistance from without thus far i.o writes the truth of the light within saving here and there the interposition of that epithite naturall

thus far have set down os words that all may see how far he accords with them in these words in the same things about which he quarrells with the not knowing what to make of their inward word and light they talke of which is indeed wholly though himselfe fees it not excepting in his often undervaluing of the light within by that name of naturall as in opposition to the qua which otherwise while he sees it serves his turn so to do against another sort of his antagonists he magnifies in words and makes as honourable with all his might as the qua do and together with them he grants that its the voyce of god a means of the knowledge of god and of his will of divine originall and authority calls for that morall obedience a higher matter then he thinks for which is eternally and indispensably due to god speaks in the name of god and from god so infallibly in the heart that it needs no other evidence assistance advantage and then not the letter to witnesse that it speakes from god is his law to which his creatures are to be subject is ascertain'd to be no deceivable pretence but that indeed by which god doth reveale himself to the soul of man that light which god hath indelibly implanted in the minds of men is accompanyed with a morall instinct of good and evill seconded with a in us in reference to gods own over us shewes the work of the law in the heart so as they are left wholly inexcusable who will not learn and know god from thence neverthelesse to go round again he pinches it back at first after he hath done magnifying it with the diminitive termes of the light of nature low dark obscure winekling light that scarcely peeps out of the most pernitious darknesse enlightening

mearly in morall matters duties morall good and evill sufficient to leave men without excuse not save nor bring them to the true knowledg of god only that which was given to man at first before he fell the state of the first man and at last a thing altogether faigned a deceivable pretence grossely imagined every ones private light making as many rules as men
that inward light the revelation that comes from which is uncertain dangerous unprofitable no way necessary to the knowing of god and his will therefore to be rejected and detested
a means of the knowledge of god and of communion with him boasted of by the fanaticks an addition to the written word of god which is most heavily damned by the spirit of god among that of confabulation with angells and others id genus furfuris of the like bran that which we are sent to that we may get the knowledge of god or any direction in our duty to him at no time and no where at all by god a principle of revelation most uncertain fallacious both as to it self and what things it reveals a meer faculty of the understanding know not what light of no correspondency with the scripture and word know not what divine soul of the world mingled in all things which is every thing and truly nothing a light which however attended to is in all divine things as to the utmost end meerly darknesse and blindnesse it self

these and many more id genus furfuris etfarraginis are the depressive debasive denominations whereby having first advanc'd the light within and law of god in heart into its proper place prerogative titles and authority as gods vicar on earth which office the pope and clergy have long usurped as a faithfull witnesse right reverend recorder and subordinate iudge for god and between god and man in the conscience doth after thrust it out again from its throne rob it of its recordership detrude it from its true title divest it of all its authority digrade it from its turn it down from the bench to the bar and there like a iustice of neither peace nor truth pass his scornfull sentence on it and damn it into utter darkness among a crue of counterfeits fanatical fancies meer figments imaginations the whole rabble of such like malefactors deceivers as any may see who having so much skill will be at so much pains as to consult those pieces of his latine piece that are to that end here cited in the margent

wee see then that though these men agree all together to witnesse against the truth yet their witnesse agrees not together within it self their assertions assent not but assault one the other about the self same subject the light some saying as they said of christ he is a good man others nay but he deceiveth the people one while tis divinae originis lumen vox dei effectualis non hominem sonat est dea aut a deo certe lux dei seipsam declarans et suara per quam deus infallibiliter revelat seipsum hominibus quid verbis opus est cum ipsa loquitur quid testibus ad extra ad convincedum lex dei in corde mentibus hominum insita ibi loquens judicans in nomine domini dei quod seipsum exhibet cognoscendum anon again in hoc domini incipit omne malum then tis pestis labes nequitia ipsa nequitia nequior

one more iigge of about the light of god we testifie to as one and the same gift or grace of god in all as to its nature though different in measure is this which is in part toucht on above and then leave them all to dance in the dark all together if they will till they are as weary as am in tracing after them he may well say undefined span alphabet of it yet verè nihil for he first makes it every thing and at last just nothing as any one may find comparing his first treatise with his last tract of theses one while he calls it metaphoricall not pròper otherwhiles proper not metaphoricall one while natural as opposite to civill and not morall spirituall nor supernaturall otherwhiles and in other respects he makes it civill morall spirituall and in effect supernaturall as in opposition to naturall one while ironically some certain divine soul of the world mixt with all things yea all these things abovesaid yea all things also undefined span alphabet otherwhile verè nihil truly nothing one while common to all and universall but then not saving otherwhile sufficient and saving but then particular only and peculiar to few not common nor universall yea the light is made little lesse then a monster of all shapes a nescio quid a certain naturall supernaturall civill morall spirituall reall metaphoricall sufficient insufficient efficacious ineffectuall usefull useless safe dangerous peculiar common speciall generall particular universail every thing which when all comes to all is none knowes what but a meer just nothing so here is a unity thus parting it self into a plurality divided first into a duality then turned into a trinity then quartered into a quaternity then extended into an universality or certain omniality and then as some nihil in nil revertens returning back into a particularity and narrowed up nearer into a neutrality till it resolve and annihilate it self at last into a very nullity

thus the priest's work who talk for self

is tangling talk against it self gainst truth a prate a piteous preachment that can't make good its own impeachment
as dr owens doctrine does who heeds not well which way he goes baxter's tomb's dansons dances round and round again in th self same ground it staggers to and fro and reels skips up and down and runs on wheels starts aside like some broken bow crosses christ like cris crosse in th row whoso can feel in it may feel as twere a wheel within a wheel a net gin trap a snare's in it a whirlpool gulf bottomlesse pit wind dust husk chasse no stable steeple a tale that takes unstable people a toy a cloud mist smoak a fogg no quakerisme but some quavering bogg a a quagmire that sucks who's in his feet out hardly plucks himself who's in gets seldome out it self's more seldome in then out it flutters like some blind night bat now here now there this way now that now it is one thing then another and now and then nor one nor other

christ's light springing arising up shining forth and displaying it self thorow the whole world from under that priestly darkness wherewith it hath been clouded and overcast by the space of one thousand two hundred sixty years in this our world
sect
our testimony and that truth to which we bear testimony who by those to whom wo is forasmuch as they tremble not at the word of god are scornfully stiled quakers is no different thing nor another but plainly one and altogether the same which all the holy men and prophets of god have held forth as also christ himself and all his apostles and ministers as many as have spoken as they were moved of god from the beginning of the world to this very day

for even as they whose testimony who even few or none either believed or received so we who are of her children of all and only whom wisdom is justified give testimony to wisdom it self not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world who come to nought but to that hidden wisdom which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known they would not crucifie the lord of glory the wisdom of god is a mystery even the light of the lord god and jesus christ who are light and in whom is no darkness at all yea to that glorious light that is now arising to enlighten that holy city new ierusalem where now there is to be no more night into which nothing shall in any wise enter that defileth


concerning which light christ himself said to paul being now truly converted to it which he persecuted before throw the blindness of his mind now send thee to the nations to open their

eyes and to turn them from the darkness to the light from the power of satan unto god that they may receive remission of sins an inheritance among those that are sanctified by faith that is in me


neither was this the business and ministry which paul onely received of god that he might fulfil it but iohn testines that this was the message which he together with the rest of christ ministers had received from himself to declare which was also the beginning not any new thing however it might seem new as being clouded till the darkness was past and the true light shined again out of the darkness that sometime clouded it but the old thing which was from the beginning namely that god is light and in him is no darkness at all and that if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have mutual fellowship with him and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin

moreover that who saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now


concerning which light of god of which the scripture every where speaketh and from which inlightning the penmen thereof the scripture it self was given forth which also was which also shined in the heart of man long befere the scriptures were we together with the scripture the writers thereof do testify this self same thing namely that a certain measure certain beams were of old and now are given of god in the conscience of every of them to the sons of men who although god made them after his own image upright blameless have yet sought out to themselves both various and vain inventions and corrupted their wayes and erred and as to any help they can have from themselves are in a manner wholly perished from the true god from the true knowledge of him whom

truly to know is life eternal and from all communion with him to shine in their dark heart as a light in a dark place to bring them back through the of their evill deeds word and thoughts and of that whole chaos of confusion and corruption that came in by the fall which condemnation this light will bring on all that take good heed to it and through the mortification of that old man and body as well as of death as sin with all its earthly members and in a word of all whatever in man is contrary to the image and will of god and turn them back unto god unto that primitive state of purity righteousness and innocency from which they departed to worship images in their own imaginations to know and to worship the true god who is a spirit truly in spirit in truth with which worship onely the lord is worshipped according to his will and lastly to enjoy such spiritual peace communion with him as none are by any means possible as is aforesaid capable of while they are alienated from him by the darkness of iniquity while they remain in their transgression incorrigible and unconverted



for both iews and gentiles as it is written are concluded all under sin there is not one righteous no not one there is none that under standeth there is none that seeketh after god they are all gone out of the way they are altogether become unprofitable there is none that doth good no not one their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poyson of asps is under their lips their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet is swift to shed blood wasting and misery is in their wayes and the way of peace they have not known there is no fear of god before their eyes so that every mouth is stopped and the whole world become guilty before god for al have sinned and short of the glory of god


this is the state of all seperated by the fall from the light into the darkness among whom even all of

what oever sex nation language condition or age at least that is capable to discern between good and evil say all may say within themselves we are lost we are gone down headlong into the utmost darkness into extream damnation from god neither is their any other way to life exhibited but by iesus christ the light of the world by some measure of light at least shining from himself enlightening as it's said every man that comes into the world shining in darkness in the dark consciences of men though the darkness comprehend it not holding by the hand also as it were leading by the hand those that being in nared in chains of darkness thrust down into the pit do not winke with their eyes to the further blinding of them but according to the councel of christ himself believe in the light whilst they have it that they may become children of the light for am the light of the world saith christ he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life also am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth in me may not remain in darkness

came not to damn the world but to save the world


in this manner therefore is christ the salvation of the world as he is the light of the world destroying the works of the devil who hath wrought in the darkness to the setting up of a principality and a kingdom to himself in the hearts of men and redeeming men from the power of the prince of the darkness of this world unto god who is light and to see light even the light of life in his light


in like manner doth the prophet isaiah affirm christ to be given of god for a covenant to the people for a light to the nations to open the blind eyes and to bring out of prison them that sit in darkness even the blind which have eyes and see not

and after him paul testifieth that christ was set as a light to the nations that he might be the lords salvation to the ends

of the earth
simeon also speaking by the holy spirit of the child iesus calls him that salvation of his which the lord had prepared before the face of all people to be a light to lighten the nations and the glory of his people israel


in as much therefore as christ is the light of the world he is the saviour of the world and so far only are men saved by him as they believe in him who is the light and in that light wherewith he doth enlighten every man in his own conscience and set themselves to walk after it which leads no man into iniquity and so far forth are all men liable to condemnation before god as they walk not in this which is in them howbeit not consenting to any but testifying against all iniquiry even the least and also reproving and condemning it even in them who are not in it but walking contrary to it in the darkness


for although god in his great love gave his son for a light not that he might damn the world but that the world through him might be saved and be that believeth in him is not condemned yet he that believeth is condemned already and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world into the inmost consciences of men there manifesting good and evill but men love the darkness rather then the light because their deeds are evill for he that doth evill harsth the light neither cometh to the light his deeds should be reproved but who so doth truth he cometh to the light what his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god


and al though all that obtain justification are justified freely by the grace of the lord through the redemption that is made in iesus christ alone yea cursed be he and cursed will he be that seeks for justification any other way for he who is the light of the world is also that corner stone which however it be set at nought by a thousand and thousand of the is yet

made the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other nor is there any other name save that of christ the light under heaven given among men whereby they must be saved

nevertheless no further is any man accepted of god or justified by christ or the grace of god in christ then as he is directed by christ the light and is by the grace of god by that inward with of god by the light of god and christ in his conscience which is given of god for this very end that it may teach and lead taught and led unto repentance from the unfruitfull works of darkness


for this light shewes the riches of the goodness and long suffering and forbearance of him who is long suffering not will that any should perish but that all should come to us by repentance is that very grace of god bringing salvation that hath appeared to all men teaching all that will learn what it teacheth that denying ungodlyness and worldly lusts they should live soberlys righteously and godly in this world which kind of life will otherwise be to late to begin to live in the world to come which grace being received in vain how much more being despised by the hardness of the heart refusing to repent wrath is treasured up against the day of wrath and the revelation of the righteous judgement of god who will render unto every one according to his works to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and immortality eternall life but unto them that are contentious and obey not the truth but obey unrighteousnes indignation and wrath for

tribulation and anguish is to come upon every soul of man that worketh evill but glory honour and peace to every one that worketh good hath to the jew and also to the greek for there is no respect of persons with god but in every nation he that him and manketh righteousness is accepted with him but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul rateth


and howsoever the world which is call'd christian together with

the manifold sects professors and meerly nominal christians and ministers thereof may dream that they have christ their redeemer very often calling him lord iesus continuing in the mean time in all disobedience to his light yet the foundation of the lord standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth who are his and let every one that nameth the of christ depart from iniquity


for the day of the lord draweth nigh wherein both every man and his deeds shall be made manifest for the day which is the light shall declare them for they shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans works of what sort they are and in that day all those shall be awakened and shall know that as concerning the truth they have erred far from the mark and that not every one that saith unto christ lord lord shall enter into the kingdome of heaven but he that doth what christ saith and what the will is of his father is in heaven and though they have prophecyed in his name and done great things nevertheless for as much as they departed not from iniquity they shall be doom'd from christ with from me ye workers of iniquity know you not


then shall the whole multitude of transgressors of the law of the light of god in the conscience by which all even those that have not the law written in an outward letter are a law to themselves having the work of the law written in their hearts that the lamb of god came not to tolerate but to take away the sin of the world and that iesus was sent not to give liberty to sin but to set his people at liberty from their sins and that in the greatest liberty wherwith christ freeth his people there is the least licence and that the father having raised up his son hath sent him to blesse men they turning away every one of them from his iniquitie that those blessed ones to whom the the lord imputeth not sin iniquities forgiven whose sin is covered are such in whose spirit there is

no guile and that there is in no wise any remission of sins unto those who still accustome themselves to a dayly commission of them


moreover the great and terrible day of the lord now cometh wherein the light which is risen in the of men shall dayly more and more clearly shine forth in which also the book of conscience must be opened that of it all men may be judged according to all things that are written therein where by the light which is gods faithfull witness all sin is written down in the sight of god as with a pen of iron in which day by the light god will come night to us to judgement and then the righteousness grace and mercy of god shall be revealed towards all who standing still in his light wait for him to come as a redeemer to them from their impieries that they may be saved from the wrath that is to come upon all the children of disobedience by which light the wrath of god shall be manifested from heaven in their own against all ungodliness unrighteousness of men who retain the truth in unrighteousness in which day god will reign down upon the wicked snares fire brunstone and an horrible tempest all which things shall be the portion of their cup


moreover in the hand of god there is now a cup and the wine thereof is red and it is full of mixture and he poureth one of the same and iudgment is begun at the house of god and god hath begun to bring evil upon the people upon whom his name is written and his nature image is imprinted they whose portion it is not in such a measure as they have drunk of the cup of abomination and fornication have drunk also of the cup of indignation and wrath before they could take the cup of salvation and the name of the lord in no wise therefore shall the wicked go unpunished but the worshippers of the beast and those that receive his image must drink also of this wine which is poured one of the

mixture into the cup of his indignation and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angells and of the lamb yea the very dregs hereof the top whereof the children of the light and of the day have tasted the children of the night and of the darkness that is all the wicked ones of the earth shall drink and wring them out


wherefore whilst in the long suffering of god opportunity is not wanting unto you whilst the day of your visitation is neer unto you from god let my councell be accepted of you all and turn your selves to the light of christ in your own consciences and take councell thereat for ever which seriously and sincerely minding you shall be taught by christ himself whose testimony to you from heaven that is to your both externall internall and eternall peace and salvation and shall be brought to christ himself and to see him and his father from both whom it comes to the saving knowledg of whom there can be no coming any other way whatsoever for as the sun of this outward world is not seen but by that light which flows from it self unto us so neither is the sun of righteousnesse but by that measure of light how little soever it be that shines from him in the heart


for although the scripture which speakes of the light and directs to the light maketh mention of the father and of the son so that there ye may read of them and speak of them also according to what ye there read yet this the scripture it self witnesseth that none can know either the father or the son but he to whom the father and the son do mutually reveal each the other whose revelation also is made within

for that which may be known of god sufficient to salvation is manifest in men saith paul for god doth manifest it in them and the gospell is preached in every creature which is under heaven

by the light of god in the conscience so that they are left inexcusable before god

who else would be excusable blameless forasmuch as though they know god yet they glorify him not as god neither like to retain god in their knowledge but knowing the judgement of god that they which do such things as they do are worthy of death yet not onely do the same but have pleasure in those that do them


in the mean while we do not affirm christ himself to be in all men who yet is known to be in all that are not reprobates as that hope of glory nevertheless all for there is no difference but what is made by different degrees of light which do not vary the nature of the thing have some measure or other of his light at least one talent committed to them that they may trade therewith to profit withall which using well and doubling they have entrance into the joy of their lord but hiding of which and not gaining therewith they shall be thrust out at last from the light they have into the utter darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth this light therefore shines in all even the in some measure although not in all in the same measure

to the measure of which light of christ which in you is you will do well to take heed while you have it as unto a light shining in a dark place to give you the knowledge of your salvation and guide your feet in the way of peace and that you may find true rest to your burdened and wearied souls and lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth nor at what he stumbles


this light is the law of god for the law is light saith the wise man

written not with luke but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone as of old for a figure hereof by the finger of god but in fleshly tables of the heart in which may be read and understood not onely as in the scripture and the law without the right that is what you should do and should be but the fact also that is what you do

and what you are for to know thy self whom if thou knowst not thou knowst not christ whom if thou knowst not its no profit to thee to know other things this comes no other way then by an inward beholding of thy self in that more inward namely the light of christ by which god shines in the conscience which light leads those that follow it to hear that true and living word of god of which the scripture declares

that its powerfull and mighty and sharper then any sword piercing even to the dividing of the soul and spirit and of the marrow and reines discerning the thoughts and cogitations of the heart before which all things are naked bare that it is as fire and as an hammer breaking the rocks in pieces and causing all things to tremble at the hearing thereof which was in the beginning before the scripture was which testifies of it concerning which the scripture both old new doth truly testify it's not far off but nigh in the heart and mouth that thou maist do it even that very word of faith the apostles preached


this light is that good old way older than the eldest among the sects of this age whether of iewes or christians who all in the mean time namely both catholiks and lutherans and calvinists baptists every one professing themselves to be the antient est have divided the grand tree of the old roman church into so many branches lesser boughs and little twigs that the whole body thereof wil ere long be sick even unto death she who hath been so long the mother of so many children is almost now devoured of her own children
this light say is that antient way unto which god by the prophet ieremiah called back the israelites when degenerated from god into their own traditions saying stand in the wayes and see and ask for the antient paths where that good way walk therein and you shall find rest unto your souls but they said we

will not walk therein hearken to the voice of the trumpet but they said we will not hearken


this light is a teacher that cannot deceive for it is the testimony of god which is greater than the testimony of man nor yet can it flatter for it reproves every one justly not justifying the wicked and condemning the innocent but telling every one the truth concerning himself directly as the case is and no otherwise accusing and excusing then god himself from whom it is for if by that which is shining from god in thee thy own heart condemns thee there is no god without that holds thee guiltless but when by that thy heart condemns thee not then maist thou have boldness before god


finally this light is that perfect law of liberty of which whoso is a hearer and not a doer he is like a man that beholds his natural face in a glass which so soon as ever he hath beheld and is gone away he straitway forgets what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into it and continueth therein and is not a forgetful and an idle bearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed

henceforth therefore who ere thou art who wouldst know thy self do not seek thy self out of thy self but behold thy self within in that inward light which inwardly gives the not only of the good and perfect mind and will of god concerning thee but also of thy own mind and of thy whole self and that so perfectly that concerning these and even all things pertaining to the salvation of the soul and the kingdom of god with the righteousness thereof and what haereditary right thou hast therein which is nigh wch is within saith christ to the pharisees

who never entred into it there is no need that thou shouldst go forth of thy self in order to a further evidence and understanding of them yea thou knowest more than enough already if of the good will of god thou knowest more than thou

livest up to for what good is only known and not done tends only unto thy condemnation in all openness and plainness and not in knowing what is to be done but in doing what is already known stands the salvation of the sons of men


moreover what hinders unless they be delighted in the blinding of their own eyes the stopping of their eares and the hardning of their hearts in rejecting the councell of god to their own perdition but that the wicked may come to the life of god from which they stand estranged for the way to that life howere it's narrower and straiter by reason of the cross of christ which is dayly to be taken up by those that follow him then that wide and broad way that leads to destruction for which cause it is that so many enter in by this and so few by the other yet is together with that which tends unto death so plainly made manifest by the light that unless it be to such as are willingly ignorant it cannot easily be hidden


for the fruits of the spirit or works of the light which are righteousness love goodnes faith gentlenes sobriety temperance chastity which who so brings forth to god lives with god and sees god are manifest to every one that doth not wink against the light in his own conscience and the works of darkness or of the flesh such as are adultery fornication uncleannes lascivicusness idolatry hatred variance emulation wrath strife seditions heresies envy murders drunkenness revellings and such like which whoeever doth shall never enter into the kingdom of god are manifest saith the scripture

and that not so much by the scripture as by the light to which the scripture testifies and by which they were manifest in the consciences of men before the scripture was and are made manifest at this day where the scripture is not by which also they would have been made manifest if the scripture had never been for all things that are reproved saith the spirit

in the scripture are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light


to this therefore all apply your minds to this come in this walk and continually abide even in the spirit of god which reproveth the world and comforteth the saints called redeemed and chosen out of the world here stand continually that ye may both know your selves and comprehend false spirits with the works and children of darkness who are comprehended and discerned by the spirit by the light although these comprehend neither it nor its children and that grace mercy and peace may be multiplyed to you from god the father and from iesus christ whose councell in the conscience whosoever hearkens to shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from even the fear of evil for this is a brazen wall to a man to be inwardly conscious to himself of no evill not to wax pale at the sense of any crime

but who so turnes aside from the light leaving the pathes of righteousness to walk in the wayes of darkness as he is inwardly condemned of himself so both errour terrour do meet him at every turn so that howbeit he carryes outwardly a shew of laughter and mirth yet he goes often grievously griped and within waxes pale at the sense of that which the wife of his own bosome is ignorant of


all these things abovesaid which at first were written in latine more privately for the sake and use of a singular eminent friend in germany are now with no other alteration then the case requires not without god himself also moving thereunto given forth more publikely as well in english as in latine in service to you academians and all others to whom we are ready according to peters councell to render a reason of the faith which is in us with meekness and fear having a good conscience and to this end that both ye whose eares being turn'd away from the

truth are turned unto fables ye who itching and attending to no other business then telling and hearing some new thing suppose we bring certain strange and new doctrines to your eares may know that we bring no new things but all the old things even the which by gods ministers were uttered from the very beginning which al we know either to your salvation or greater condemnation your selves shall once acknowledge even for ever


of which yet we are not slack to warn by admonition to awaken you forasmuch as though to say the same things that were said before its not grievous to us yet for you it's safe who by over much incogitancy inadvertency may truly say are ignorant of what ye know

which truly if in the same light and with the same sincere spirit with which they were written they may be throughly by any it shall repent neither me to have written nor you to have read what is here written

but if otherwise and if this friendly of your salvation shall stir up in you the spirit of enmity malignity and receive from you rather an ignominious repulse then an healthfull hearkening thereunto it shall please me enough that in this work have pleased god am clear of the blood of your souls and ye at last shall remember at least yet not without repentance though too late that ye were warned from god

non veni ut damnem mundum sed ut servem mundum


hoc modo itaque christus est salus mundi ut est lux muudi destruens opera diaboli qui in tenebris operatus est ad erigendum sibi regnum principatum in cordibus hominum redimens a potentia principis tenebrarum hujus seculi ad deum qui est lux ad videndum lucem etiam lucem vitae in luce sua


eodem plane modo dicit esaias propheta christum fuisse a deo traditum in faedus populi in lucem gentium ad aperiendum caecos oculos ad extrahendum carcere sedentes in tenebris etiam caecos qui oculos habent sed non vident

et post illum testatur paulus christum constitutum fuisse lucem gentibus ut sit saluti a domino ad extremitates terrae

nec non simeon per spiritum sanctum de jesu puerulo epum suam quam

quamvis de dito deus lucem non ut damnet mundum mundus per eum servetur qui credit in cum non condemnatur qui tamem non credit vel jam condemnatus haec est condemnatio quod venit in mundum hominum conscientias malum manifestans sed deligunt homines potius tenebras quam quia opera eorum sunt mala quisquis enim quae mala sunt agit odit lucem ad me redarguantur opera ipsius qui vero veritatem aut manifesta fiant opera ipsus quod sunt in deo operata

magnusille tertibilis dies domini jam advenit in quo lux quae orta est in conscientiis hominum magis ac magis quotidie elucescet in quo liber etiam conscientiae aperiendus est ut ex illo judicentur omnes secundum omnia quae ibi scripta sunt ubi per lucem quae est testis dei fidelis peccatum omne inscribitur in conspectu dei tanquam cum penna ferrea in quo per lucem prope nobis veniet deus ad judicium revelabitur justilia gratia miserecordia dei in omnes in luce sua sistentes expectant eum venturum liberatorem eis ab impietatibus ut salvi fiant ab ira illa ventura in omnes inobedientiae filios per quam patebit ira deie caelo in ipsorum conscientiis adversus omnem impietatem injustitiam hominum quiveritatem injuste detineant in quo die pluet deus in improbos laqueos ignem sulphur horribilem procellam hujusmodi omnia erunt portio eorum poculi

quamobrem dum in longanimitate dei non deest vobis opportunitas dum a deo adest vobis dies visitationis vestrae concilium hoc nostrum capiatis omnes dehinc convertatis ipsos ad lucem christi in vestris ipsorum conscientiis exinde consilium capiatis in eternum quam se io sincere animadvertentes a christo ipso cujus testimonium vobis de coelo haec est ad pacem salutem vestram tum externam tum internam tum eternam dedocibimini ad christum ipsum ad videndum eum patrem ejus a quibus deducemini ad quorum cognitionem salutarem quocunque alio modo perveniri non potest sicut enim non cernitur sol hujus mundi nisi per lumen quod ab ipso profluit ad nos ita nec sol justitiae nisi per mensuram illam lucis quantumvis parvam quae ab eo fulget in corde


etiamsi enim scriptura quae de luce loquitur ad lucem dirigit de patre ac de filio verba facit ita ut de his possitis legere ac loqui quod ibi legitis hoc tamen ipsa testatur scriptura cognoscere vel patrem vel filium nisi cui pater filius revelabunt quorum revelatio etiam est introsum

quod enim de deo cognosci potest sufficienter ad salutem manifestatur in hominibus inquit paulus

nam deus in ipsis manifestum fecit praedicatum est in omni creatura quae sub caelo est lucem dei in conscientia adeo ut inexcusabiles coram deo relicti sunt qui aliter excusabiles essent

inculpati siquidem cum deum norint non tamen ut deum glorificant nec visum est illis deum in notitia retinere sed dei jure agnito nempe eos qui talia faciuut ipsi dignos esse morte non solum ea faciunt sed facientibus ultro consentiunt


interea tamen non dicimus christum ipsum esse in omnibus qui in omnibus esse notus est qui non sunt reprobi ut spes illa gloriae veruntamen omnes nam non est distinctio nisi per varios gradus lucis qui non variant rei naturam mensuram lucis suae aliqualem unum saltem talentum habent sibi commissum ut negotiati sint cum eo ad utilitatem quo bene utentes duplicantes ingressum habent in gaudium domini sui quod vero occultantes et non lucrantes cum eo detrusi sunt tandem a luce quam habuerunt in tenebras illas exteriores ubi est fletus et stridor dentium aliqualiter itaque in omnibus etiam ethnicis lux haec lucet licet non aequaliter in omnibus

ad christi lucis mensuram quae est in vobis est benefacietis si attendatis dum habeatis velut ad lucernam splendentem in obscuro loco ad dandum vobis cognitionem salutis vestrae ad dirigendum pedes vestros ad viam pacis ut animabus vestris oneratis fatigatis veram requiem inveniatis ne vos tenebrae deprehendant nam qui ambulat in tenebris nescit quo vadat nec ad quod impingetur


haec lux est lex dei nam lex est lux inquit sapiens

inscripta non atramento sed spiritu dei vivi non in tabulis lapideis ut olim in figuram hujus per dei digitum sed in carneis tabulis cordis in qua non solum legatur intelligatur ut in scriptura lege ad extra de jure quid ageres quid esses sed de facto etiam quid agis quid

es nam noscere teipsum quem si ignoraveris christum haudquaquam noveris quem si nescis nihil est si caetera noscis hoc non aliunde venit nisi per internum tui ipsius intuitum in intimiori hoc speculo nempe luce christi per quam splendet deus in conscientia quae lux ducit sequentes eam ad audiendum verbum illud verum vivum dei de qua scriptura loquitur

quod est potens efficax ac penetrantius quovis gladio aucipiti pertingens usque ad divisionem animae simul ac spiritus compagumque medullarum dijudicans cogitationes conceptus cordis cui omnia sunt manifesta nuda quod ut ignis est malleus confringens rupes causans ut ad audiotionem ejus tremebunda redduntur omnia quod in initio fuit priusquam scriptura fuit quae de eo testatur de quo scriptura tum vetus tum nova veraciter testatur quod non procul sed prope est in corde in ore ut faciatis etiam hoc ipsum verbum fidei quod apostoli praedicabant


haec lux est bona illa via antiqua antiquior quam antiquisima inter sectas hujus seculi vel jusdaeorum vel christianorum qui omnibus interim viz tum catholicis tum lutheranis tum calvinistis tum bapristis se esse antiquissimos profitentibus in tot ramos ramulos ramusculos veteris ecclesiae romanae truncum diviserunt ut totum corpus ejus ad mortem brevi aegrotabit quae tot tam diu fuerit filiorum mater pene devorata jam est a filiis suis haec lux inquam est antiqua illa via ad quam per jeremiam revocavit deus israelitas in suas ipsorum traditiones a deo degeneratos dicens sistire cernite ac quaerite pro antiquis semitis ubi est bona ilia via ambuletis in illa invenietis requiem animabus vestris sed dixerunt non

ambulabimus in illa auscultate voci tubae sed dixerunt non auscultabimus


haec lux est doctor qui non potest decipere nam est testimonium dei quod testimonio hominum majus est nec potest nam unumquemque redarguit juste non justificans improbum nec condemnans justum sed unicuique verum dicens de seipso prout res ipsa est non aliter accusans aut defendens quam deus ipse a est si enim per hanc quae est a deo in te lucens cor tuum te condemnat non datur deus ad extra te pro justo habens vbi vero per hanc cor tuum te non condemnat securitatem coram deo habeas


denique haec lux est perfecta illa libertatis lex cujus qui est auditor non effector is similis est viro consideranti faciem suam nativam in speculo qui simulatque consideravit seipsum abit statim oblitus est qualis esset in quam vero si quis introspexerit permanserit in illa nec est auditor obliviosus nec otiosus sed actor operis hic beatuserit in opere suo


dehinc itaque quicunque teipsum nosceres ne te quaesiveris extra sed reipsum introrsum intuearis in luce illa interna quae non modo mentem ac voluntatem dei de te bonam perfectam sed tuam ipsius mentem ac totaliter teipsum tibi discernendum intus tam perfecte exhibet ut de hisce aeque ac de omnibus ad animae falutem ad regnum dei pertinentibus cum justitia ejus quale tibi jus est haereditarium in illo quod prope est quod intus est inquit christus pharisaeis

qui tamen nunquam ingressi sunt in illud non opus est ut egrediavis foras in ordine ad ulteriorem evidentiam intelligentiam imo fatis jamjam intelligis si de beneplacito dei agnoveris plus quam agis cedit enim tibi in condemnationem

tantum quodcunque bonum agnitum est non actum in aperto facili nec in cognoscendo quid agendum est sed in agendo quod notum est salus filtorum hominum


quinimo quid impedit nisi in excacatione oculorum obturatione aurium obduratione cordium suorum rejectione consilii dei in perditionem suam delectentur quominus ad vitam dei a qua alieni sunt perveniant improbi via enim ad hanc quantumcunque angustior strictior est prae cruce christi quae indies tollenda est ab iis qui eum sequuntur quam lata spatiosa illa quae ducit in exitium qua de re tam multi per hanc tam pauci per illam introeunt per lucem tamen una cum ea quae ad mortem tendit fit tam plane manifesta us nisi sponte ignorantibus non potest facile occultari


fructus enim spiritus ceu o·pera lucis qualia sunt justitia charitas bonitas fides lenitas sobrietas temperantia continentia quos qui deo profert cum deo vivit deumque videt cuiquam contra lumen in conscientia sua non conniventi sunt manifesta opera tenebrarum ceu carnis sunt adulterium scortatio impuritas lascivia idololatria veneficium inimicitia lites a mulationes excandescentia rixae dissidia haereses invidia caedes ebrietas commessationes his similia qualia quicunque agunt regni dei haeredes non erunt manifesta sunt inquit scriptura

idque non tam per scripturam quam per lucem cui testatur scriptura per quam manifesta fuerint in conscientiis hominum antequam scriptura fuit hodie manifesta fiunt ubi scriptura non est per quam etiam manifesta forent fi scriptura nunquam fuisset
omnia enim quae redarguantur inquit spiritus in scriptura

per lucem manifesta sunt lux enim est illud quod omnia manifesta facit


ad hanc itaque animos vestros adhibeatis omnes ad hanc veniatis in hac ambuletis perpetuo mane atis etiam in spiritu dei qui redarguit mundum consolatur sanctos ex mundo vocatos redemptos electos hic horatim sistatis ut vosmet ipsos sciatis comprehendatis malos spiritus qui per lucem comprehenduntur ac dijudicantur licet hi nec eam nec filios ejus comprehendunt ut gratia miserecordia pax multiplicetur vobis a deo patre a jesu christo cujus consilio in conscientia quicunque auscultaverit habitaverit secure quietus erit etiam a metu mali hic enim est mutus ahaenus homini interne

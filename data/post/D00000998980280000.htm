my lord

the great blessing of peace being the improvement of arts and that of war so long as this mass of earth continues in its fabrick of creation beyond all dispute most useful to cultivate this art in time of peace is no less the interest of mankind than it is in summer to provide food and raiment for the winter peace and war succeeding

each other by short intervalls so naturally and almost with the motion of the sun in the zodiack
the practice then of this art since first man begun to loose the reins of his choller continued through a long tract of ages to this hour having rendered it no less honourable than its first institution was necessar it cannot but be agreeable to the genius of mankind to prosecute an art necessary useful and honourable
nor is the use of arms even the length of an imaginary war to be intermitted in the highest crisis of the most serene peace unless the one half of the world resolve to become slaves to the other liberty being scituate like the brain which though it rest secure in the immediate embraces of a pa mater yet if not guarded by the triple contravallation of a dura mater scull and pericranium the first being a very tender membrane were not able of it self to protect it from injury so peace if not fortified by a continual guard and a constant exercise of arms is not able of it self to preserve it self nor maintain the liberty of the great monarchies or smallest estates and republicks as the jealous practice of luca geneve ragouse and many other states do fully evidence nor do think that nation worthy of peace who neglects the use of arms when they have attain'd it

besides my lord if were umpyre in the quarrel betwixt those two famous rivals of the world peace and war could almost declare the first more injurious to the latter than the latter to it war both procuring and preserving peace but peace somewhat ungrate in a few years ofttimes destroying its rival rendering the spirits of men by soft ease and its consequences so unapt for war as by this subtile insinuation of peace like that of the serpent in paradise nations have on a sudden forfeit their liberty honour and peace it self
this consideration made the poet justly exclaim of the state of the roman empire in his time nunc patimur longae pacis mala saevior armis luxuria incubuit victumque ulciscitur orbem
the repose of a few moneths in capua made soon an army that had jumpt over the pyrences and alps as though they had been mole hills sweep'd with their very breath their way to cannae and from thence cut out a passage to rome and became so terrible as fame it self could hardly represent the valour of it in her magnifying glass this same formidable and well disciplin'd army a few moneths ease made no less contemptible and ridiculous than a company of drunken boors at a fair
whereas the practice and use of warlike exercises in time of peace preserves and maintains it firmly no nation being more secure than that which is perfect in the art of war
the conquest of the soft and peaceable eastern nations was but the business of an ordinary compagne or two to the meanest of the roman generals those effeminate gallants hugging so their delilah of peace as they permitted her to cutt their hair and deprive them of both strength and courage but to disturb the peace of the western or northern nations accustomed to war was a province only for a caesar a germanicus an agricola or the like nec facile vincuntur vincere non vinci assueti

pray what did all the romans huffings upon the rhine for some hundred years produce when they thought forsooth they had secured that vast continent betwixt the alps and the what says their noble and ingenuous historian why after he has reckoned up a great many consuls generals emperors affronted disgraced and defeat in subduing those stubborn warriours many legions cut off much time and treasure spent germani sayes he magis triumphati quam victi sunt they were forc'd for honours cause to rest contented with an imaginary conquest of that warlike nation a virtue so transmitted to their posterity that how dear the germans yet esteem their liberty may appear by our weekly gazetts
nay this very day we know

that the turk having found the business with the sterne and martial pole too hot has now tack'd about and is forced to turn his conquering arms against the more peaceable and soft russian whom if not assisted by the other europaeans he may bring in some distress
to relate how much our nation however traduced by our unkind scribling neighbours has maintain'd its liberty against a
assailants and though sometimes by powerful armies yet never losing courage or embracing the title of conquered as those who brag more of their valour have done but still rallying and recovering their ground not to be conquered by arms but a glorious succession only were my lord to make an historie of an intended epistle dedicatory and therefore rather to be pointed at than tyrannicallie to impose the patience upon your lordship of an ample rehearsal which should in this place attempt the same might be said of this piece as the stoick said of the city mindas the ports were so big and the town so little he was afraid it might escape out at the ports
upon these grounds then my lord having endeavoured to prove that the exercise of war is the only bullwark of peace do now subsume at least presume that amongst all the methods of war known in historie that of archery being since the memory of man universally practised though now by the use of almost only reserv'd for sport is the most noble and useful and by consequence the most necessarie to be cultivate whilst now we are blessed with peace that we may be in readiness for war the bow having been before the invention of guns the only received weapon and if well used am confident of equal force in battel though not of so much noise as the musquet now only in use amongst those whose predecessors excelled in archery and the use of bow

since then my lord your lordship has thought it worth your paines to revive in this nation the almost extinguished art of archery and by your own example worthie of one descended of so noble and ancient a line of ancestors famous

both in peace and war to encourage all the nobility gentry and commons of this kingdom to resume the exercise of an art so much hitherto neglected
as the whole nation with one voice do owne the obligation to your lordships generous endeavours hoping that from your lordships original many thousand copies may be quickly dispersed and transmitted to posterity
so having the honour to be of that worthy society of which your lordship is pleased to recieve the title of captain and not in good capacity to attend your lordship in the complement of parade being yet but a bad proficient in the art am ambitious by another art in which pretend to some smattering knowledge to demonstrate in the ensuing poëtical essay how much in the general concurrence of the nation a particular person may express himself

my lord your lordships most humble and most devoted
archery reviv'd
to rake the bowels of antiquity in seting out the praise of archery or rouze our valiant predecessours ghosts of whose bold actings grave tradition boasts only to show us how in every age our archer did excell in martial rage or state the question twixt the bow and gun which of those champions have most honour won or which o'th two in field most useful are to carry on the motions of a war were a brave subject such as might infuse thoughts worth the labour of a nobler muse to mould in verse than any pretend to be of my acquaintance and if penn'd by one whose envy'd leasure doth licence with what in others we can scarce dispense though done in fashion of a scantling proëme would bear the name of an heroick poëme
but who am allow'd by sullen fate to live in silence cause our wits do hate all native product and with pain do read ought that derives its birth from this side tweed cannot safely trade in such a theme unless enter'd in a strangers name and so perhaps it may procure esteem for where our own will strictly survey'd be a strangers would at least pass
yet maugre all those of fate i'le venture on it and expatiate

a little on the subject specially in honour of a brave fraternity whose joynt endeavors might with ease contrive a better art then this far more revive an art scarce yet extinct an art which all once practis'd an art epidemicall
yet will not extoll this art so high as with it's rivalls may beget envy decrying wars inventions of late no i'le not bend my bow at such a rate lest while in praise of archery sing the bow too much bent may the string
nor will give directions for the bow that were to teach an art do not know but modestly i'le comment on the game in praise of all who bear an archers name
for many one do talk as all men know of who ne're shot in his bow
if arts perfection do consist in that we thereby nature strive to imitate and every art derives it's excellence from it's proximity to nature thence archery may be tearm'd the noblest art which humane genius ever did impart
it so approaches nature tis the same and differs from't in nothing but the name
the bull wih horn the lyon with his paw defends himself and fights by natures law and man by the same rule his bow doth draw
the bow so ancient in it's primtive use as it appears dame nature did infuse the knowledge of it to be learn'd by nought but proper instinct and so cheaply bought as those who ne're were blest with knowing art yet in this knowledge have been fund expert
witness those heroes who practis'd the game

before invention did receive a name
before the race of man yet understood what twas to bath their shafts in humane blood before their choller did advance so far as to engage them in a civill war
these only us'd their bows to purchase food so much as frugal nature then allow'd fierce in the sport and eager in the chace of all alive save their own species
yea whn the race increas'd and private jarrs at first squander into open wars the bow did chiefly serve them to annoy each other which before they did employ in sports more innocent and with such force they'd use their bows as neither foot nor horse could then sustain their fury nothing more destructive of mankind and where before through herds of beasts their arrows would make way they now were forc'd to fight themselves at bay agaist each other whil'st the birds and beasts who look'd upon mens battels as their feasts would stand aloofe untill the angry bow had done it's office and revenged so their quarrel then they would advance apace and feed upon the bleeding carcasses tearing the bowels of the yet of such as on their ancestors did feed these were the only victors of the prey these masters were who ever had the day
plump with such food they'd to the woods resort vvhere man pursuing of his native sport vvould kill those conq'rors and so feed upon his own flesh in a piece of venison
thus did the active bow make sport and war assisting man in what he e're would dare so fortunately as it soon became the proper instrument of a vvarriors fame
vvhen bold columbus plough'd the western seas and with rude keele disturbed natures ease approaching gently to that happy shore vvhich never had seen masts or sails before some thousand indians with their bows in hand appear'd to dispute his descent on land those naked varlets who no art did know pray who did teach those lads the use of bow from th'other world by seas so separate as amongst some it has begot debate how these came thither from mount ararat from affrick then europe or asia had they this art no sure by natures law they learn'd this art at first for from which the art of war did soon commence
nor can we think that from those savages this noble art to our world cross'd the seas since ages before that discovery each part o'th world practised archery
all this kind nature taught then t'evidence her care for mans food and his she generously taught her sons to know no other weapon but the nervous bow of which the constant and delightful use did soon the art of archery produce an art so gracfull as doth plainly show what pleasure nature taketh in the bow strong nerves streight joynts a daring constant eye are requisite for compleat archery all which a compleat nature do imply
the bow doth courage health and strength improve refresheth nature gently doth remove noysome distempers purifies the blood encreaseth natures heat digests the good and wholsome nutriment expells the bad cherisheth jovial minds revives the sad

dejected spirits who at any price should much frequent this generous exercise
in fine this art with nature so complies it hath the same friends the same enemies who e're loves health and strength will love this art practise it often hugg it in his heart and who loves neither but desires to dye is both this art and natures enemie
this art our ancestors so well did know how both in war and sport to use the bow that when their rage did coole and softer peace allow'd their weary'd spirits some small surcease from wars consuming toyl least idleness might damp their courage and perhaps oppress thir active vitals they would still foment their generous sports with the same instrument
each youth with bow and quiver furnished with store of pointed arrows mustered in time and places ord'red by the law in select bands this fair militia vvould with such art and vigour use the bow and of their action make so goodly show such flights of arrows at one lusty draught of brauny arms whom exercise had taught vvould pierce the trembling azure altogether vvith such a force as one should scarce know whether those sprightly archers lov'd best peace of war making those sports only preliminar to bloody conflicts
for when th'exercise o'th bow had made them gallantly despise all then with such delight vvith bow in hand they'd march up to the fight as if they were in butts to snoot at white
vvho then had view'd our armies would have said he see the pride of nature there displaid to see whole squadrons of tall archers stretch

their joynts at once as if they meant to reach their enemies with fists and then advance with gracefull pace as if they were to dance full stretched nerv's and bodies full erected with cheerfull aspect which they much affected then letting flye their arrows all at once they'd make the welkin whistle for the nonce
rebounding strings such musick would affoord as did arion when thrown over boord
vvhich had pythagoras heard he had declar'd that of his planets nought with this compar'd
these gallant vvarriors fought with such a grace their bodies falling covered the place vvhere e'rst they stood and now depryv'd of breath they yet appear'd even gracefull in their death
a feather'd arrow in each bleeding breast the valour of our archers would attest
the winged shaft did seldome misse its aime such was the cunning of the noble game
vvhat brave exploits have been perform'd by bows who has but tasted hist'ry fully knows they're famous in the mouths of every boy vvho has at schools rehears'd the siege of troy
the amazonian valour to this day famous in hist'ry plainly doth display how much this active art was in esteeme by which a few girls did procure the name of brave redoubted vvarriors and tis known how terrible the name of amazon was to the eastern nations and how far these lasses did extend their fame by war against the greatest monarchs then in power whose guards one would ha'thought might soon devour such troops of naked sluts yet by this art in which bove others they were then expert

they have brought strong and numerous armies low and made the sword and lance stoop to the bow
the parthian archer in his cunning flight would with his arrows so renew the fight as those who did pursue their victory vvere conquer'd by this subtile archery
the scythian now by name of tartar known has won great honour by this art alone fighting on horse back with his great armies he does quickly overthrow and to this day the archer scythian is terrible to th pole and russian
the english monarchs in their warrs of france did by the bow their honour much advance in three great battels famous to this hour of cressie pottiers and of agineour vvhose grave historians do confess they owe these successes entirely to the bow
nor has our nation less practis'd the game and by the bow deserve their share of fame vvitness our warrs with romans picts and danes
vvhose memory in marble yet remains where the brave archer oft did overthrow well order'd legions with his faithful bow by this our kings their crown and scepter held by this the english force we oft repell'd maintaining stoutly those inumane jarrs scarce by the union yet made civil warrs
since first the balliols unhappy case umpyr'd by edward longshanks broke the peace the two brave nations living formerly in strictest bonds of love and amity begun to bristle and have ever since till become subjects of one glorious prince dispute the case so warmly as god knows what slaughter on each side by stubborn bows have been perform'd what romans saxons danes and normans spar'd that blood on british plains by british hands so prodigally spent shows that our bows in vain were never bent from trent to tine from thence to th'banks of tweed forth tay and clyde who cannot plainly read the history of our islands warrs and thence may understand both nations excellence in knowledge of the use of warlike bow better than from speed hollingshed or stow who by their bold writing prerogative do alwayes place us on the defensive
though some of their own vvriters do averr the one as oft as th'other vanquisher
but as our difference one succession wrought so has another to this island brought a fair attonement making quarrels cease and save in words has bound us to the peace
all these were feather'd vvarrs and justly claime no small proportion in the vvings of fame our nation in the bow did much delight whether they were for sport or meant to fight
though now with use of so indu'd the bow has almost gone in desuetude if so the ancient scots who still remain in their first love did not yet entertain this princely art which else would sure expire if like the embers of an evening fire the northern climate had not all this while cherish'd this art and keep'd it on the file glenlivet battel where historians say the arrows did obscure the light of day for some good space doth openly declare how much in this art the bold highlander excells to those to those alone we owe the reliques of th'almost extinguisht bow
hence a most noble hero much inclin'd yet to revive this art has now design'd t'erect again the arms of archery and counterballance bold antiquity in a most flourishing society
to whose endeavours since the nation owes the now received exercise of bows were as knowing in thalîas art as these are in the use of bows expert i'de sing the boistrous thundring cannon dumb in the clarind of their encomium
yet am hopeful by this rude essay may to quainter muses show the way and usher in of some more happy brain the richer fancy and excite their pen
and now though did promise formerly de not warrs late inventions decry yet warm i'th subject cannot refraine but must a little on our times complain who have caress'd these late inventions so as they've too much neglected th'use of bow
pity then such an art should be by th'airy fanfara's of monsieur gun that roaring gallant who the world doth choak by his continual storms of fire and smoak
that flaming hector whose asiduous use has made the world a meere vesuvious
proud of his conquests o're the generous bow in brazil peru and in mexico where with his there smoak and thunder he broke the all assunder
on him do all now doat and plainly show a general contempt o'th noble bow
our gallants now in gun do so delight as they their worthy ancestors do slight upbraiding them for their so mean a choise as that o'th bow an exercise for boyes compar'd with their that spurious rogue by heavens anger only now in vogue

who doth derive his genealogie from an officious piece of chymistry conceiv'd without nature or arts consent and thrust into the world by accident
yet has this monster gain'd so great applause as both to vvar and peace he now gives laws yea at this time our gunners possibly do look upon this show of archery as a meer formal piece of pageantry
well gentlemen who knows but in the nation bow may yet become in fashion this is but its first tryal and we hope our archers shortly may the nay perhaps ere all be done he'l quash the roaring language of the gun
mean time speak good of archers and be low for all your fathers shot once in a bow finis

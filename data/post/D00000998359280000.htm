certain reasons and argvments of policie why the king of england should hereafter give over all further treatie and enter into warre with the spaniard
for the first which is leaving off all treaty
because the english in all treaties taken in hand with the spaniard and the house of austria and continued so many yeares with such labour and charges hath not only bin vnfortunate but also scornfully abused by the spaniard who is exceedingly disagreeing from the honest mind and meaning of the english
for so many yeares while things stood stronger on the side of the english nothing hath been effected by treatie and who can presume that any thing will be effected now when things are brought into far worse case

the king by seuen diuers treaties and ambassages hath effected iust nothing in this cause which concernes the peace of germany

and the whole estate of his sonne in law

in the yeare
by the earle of carleil

by sir vvotton at uienna

by sir conway and sir vveston in the same yeare

by the lord digby

by sir vveston in the same
by the lord chichester baron of belfast

by the prince in spaine
besides how many curriers haue been sent how many letters written and what adoe been made by ordinary ambassadours and ministers


the honor of the king and kingdome requires that this tye of treaties which they haue been entangled in all this while should now be broken off
for if they should continue that course which hath brought no benefit to either themselues or to others or to the common cause who can excuse them besides they should expose themselues to co~tempt and scorne by stumbling so often vnpardonably at the same stone with their friends and subiects they should bring themselues into suspition and hate by continuing a thing so dangerous to strangers they shold not onely increase the ill opinion which the

world hath conceiued of their secure cariage but also they should giue all men good cause to forsake them hereafter if they should chance to haue need of them


by treaties the english haue not onely got and gained nothing but farther all the businesses of themselues and their friends haue euer gone backward to the worse the spaniards going forward alwaies with a high looke and a brazen face and wisely making vse of the faire forewind of fortune turning their countenance to the english and their mind to their owne aduantage


the meaning and of the spaniard is directly opposite to that of the english
for his endeuour is by treaties to circumuent to gaine time to vndoe his enemies by delayes to aduance his owne profit and dominion to despise peace as to him and his great power to nourish warre especially in germanie where by the dissention of the princes diuersity of religion assistance of his friends he may be sure not only to lose nothing but to gaine to fish safely in troubled waters
but the intention of the english

is honest viz to giue peace to europe and to euery one his owne neither doth he intend to get benefit to himselfe rule ouer others
and how can these contradictories be reconciled by treaties


the very adverse part doth ill interpret and take these treaties of the king as if thereby he intended nothing else but to gain time and to waite for the reuolution of fortune or the occasion of change with a minde altogether estranged from any peaceable composition and onely pretending an intention of treating as the archbishop of mentz doth in expresse words write of the king to the elector of saxon

reasons for the second of vndertaking warre with spaine

the faith promised mutually to one another which they haue violated the breaking of the couenants confirmed by solemne stipulation the iniuries offered the deeds and instruments of the couenants falsified and

such like as these which follow all or any one of these are esteemed of all nations iust cause of entring into warre

now then must we declare how faith hath been violated and the solemne conditions of the league haue been broken by them
the last yeare a surcease of armes for moneths was propounded of the spaniard accepted of the english and vpon certaine articles vpon both parts agreed vpon was set downe in instruments signed and sealed
but the spaniard and their complices both at the very time in which they sealed the articles and also afterward did many wayes violate and pervert them both by leauing out what was agreed vpon inserting vvhat vvas not couenanted at all
that instrument of truce vvas exhibited and communicated in the empire in the moneth of march many weeks before it was either concluded or signed in england
in the meeting at iutterbock to the end that the warlike preparations of the princes of germanie might be hindered and in hungarie to gabor that he should not stirre it was exhibited long before it was concluded as if it had bin

fully concluded and sealed
and marke their cunning and false practise by this exhibition of it and a false perswasion which they added to it that all things should shortly be accommodated were the princes of the empire so moued and perswaded that they compelled the duke of brunswick to lay downe armes and to depart out of the bounds of germanie denying him all prouision and passage
but the instruments of the truce were not subscribed by the english but in the of april old stile or the first of may new stile and after in the moneth of august ratified by the elector palatine
moreouer in those instruments and deeds giuen abroad there to germanie by the other partie these words in the third article declaring them enemies of the empire and of our allies were left out as words that might giue iust cause of offence to the princes of the empire when they should see such a hard declaration extorted and wrung out of the english
but in the instruments signed in england those words were expresly set downe notwithstanding the exception made against them by the kings sonne in law


in the last article in their deeds it was left out that the king of england should send his deputies for the interest of his son in law when yet in that consisted the very hinge and controuersie of the businesse and the foundation of the mind and will of the king of england as it is expressed in the english instruments

there is also a falshood to be noted in the subscription of the day
in the english is expressed the of april english stile in theirs the first of may
moe things may be brought to shew that there was either falshood or else double deeds

furthermore it was also expresly prouided by way of caution that all things should abide in the palatinate in the place and state as they then were during the truce that all acts of hostilitie should cease that neither allies nor friends should be offended but that both parts should enioy the peace of the league
but spaniards and their complices did doe still in the time of the truce exercise all kinds of hostilitie by confiscating of their goods who haue withdrawne themselues from the ruine of their countrey by abolishing religio by dismembring transferring vnto others

the better parts of the palatinate as was done with the lordship called the bergstras with the diocesses of bleyensteine and nevenhane others by imposing continuall seruitudes and by often extorting new contributions fro the oppressed by drawing out the bloud and soule of the afflicted and by wasting and wearing out all the poore subiects with their insolent tyrannie
the very spaniards alone haue in that part which they hold in the palatinate imposed an exaction of aboue thirty thousand dollars a moneth ouer and aboue the ordinary impositions
verdugo in his proposition when he imposed this exaction was not afraid to affirm that it was done with the knowledge and sufferance of the king of england that he did to moue the people
this extorsion hath now continued diuers moneths and is yet still exercised lastly the spaniards and their complices did neuer for all the truce lay downe armes in the empire but went on with victorious warre against the friends of the king of england and his sonne in law yea we yet see them to proceed on still scorning breaking this league of the truce making it a net to catch their enemies in


the spaniard hath by force and armes possest himselfe of the patrimony of the innocent infants the grand children of the king of england hath cast his daughter and son in law out of all their estates and dominions and doth detaine the palatinate against the hope he hath giuen and promise which hee hath so oft made of restoring it he hath besieged the citie of frankendale the dowrie of his daughter invaded it in hostile maner neither would he vouchsafe to raise the siege at the most earnest entreaty of the king of england he compelled the forces of the king of england and his generall sent thither to depart out of the palatinate scoffing and deriding the protection of england by which hee had falsly perswaded him that the palatinate should be safe


forsomuch as the spaniard doth oppresse the allies and friends ioyned in conferation and bloud with the king doth cast them out of their dominions doth pursue them with hostility euen against his faith giuen there is no other course left to help them but by armes treaties in this case will proue vnprofitable


the safety of the king and kingdome requires warre
for it behoues vs then to look to our selues when our next neighbours houses are on fire
princes lose both power and strength when their allies do perish
the encrease of a potent neighbor whose friendship is vnsafe as it cannot be without iust suspitio so is it also dangerous and hurtful
the liberty of germany now ready to perish is to be relieued and the conseruation of it doth greatly concerne both the english and all the princes of europe
germanie is the heart of europe for so nature seems to haue placed it the palatinate is the motion in the heart according to the lawes
if germaine as the heart be possest by the spaniard who striues to get the dominion ouer all europe the rest of the princes shall not long draw or enioy any vitall life or spirits
the heart therefore must be succored if you would haue the rest of the members or the body to be safe
but by these weake remedies of treaties you shal do no good stronger things are to be applyed the disease still encreasing


necessitie requires warre
great preparations for warre are made by the spaniard

here neare at hand his mind and intentions are well enough knowne
a potent prince makes no reckoning of friends when he finds opportunity to oppresse them
the english are now brought into that extremity by their owne foresaid counsels that vnlesse they do preuent by war they wil shortly be preuented
the spaniard knows ful wel that he may not trust them any longer and that it is the part of an vnwise man to stay for the first blow which is commonly the crisis of the future war by which we may take a scantling of the euent of it which is vsually ouercome by preuention and diuersio according to the saying of that prudent king
politicians say that he which consults of breaking and making war hath already broken and that he is not well advised or wary enough who neglects to preuent his enemy
the spaniard who is naturally distrustful doth without question construe take this consultation alteratio of minds in england for a breach and a war and experience will shortly shew it if prudence take not place but if he see the english men remisse he wil say that they want not stre~gth but corage and that it is base feare that keeps them back


the king of england in the yeare
the of nouemb set downe the conditions of peace what he would haue to be obserued and kept by his son in law and sent them to the emperor for his finall declaration and did the withal protest of the effusion of bloud that would follow of the warre which he should be compelled vnto if the emperour wold not subscribe vnto those co~ditions
but the emperour and the spaniard haue not only deluded the conditions but went boldly on with war against the innocent infants the kings bloud
and is he not now bound in honor to recouer what he prescribed by war which he threatned and denounced that the conditions were not performed


suspension of arms was promised at vienna to the lord digby who brought the emperors lettets with him to bruxels concerning that businesse yet by collusion was the contrary giuen in charge to the infanta and sent thither either before or at the same instant insomuch that that suspe~sion was changed into a most cruell war which was executed with the more immanity because the king of england hath vndertaken the protection of the

palatinate and was pleased to strengthen and defend it with his own garrisons
and when the lord digby had in the kings name long and exceedingly solicited but in vaine the raising of the siege at franckendale this answer was giuen him that it was against the honor of the spaniards to leaue a citie which they had once besieged without the expresse commandment of the king of spain

in the very time of the treaty at bruxels was hendelberg taken and spoiled

if he could not then obtain by treaties and entreaties a thing vncertaine and subiect to chance which was not in their hands but only in hope wil restitution of those things which they are possest of be now procured by those former means the spaniards as they will doe nothing for loue so will they also refuse nothing when they are compelled by feare and force as one of themselues hath confessed


the proscription which is the head of the euils which haue followed by which the kings son in law was declared infamous al his grandchildren pronounced fallen from al right of successio was most earnestly solicited by the archduke albert and was consulted of

in the spanish ambassadours house
and is there not then iust cause that the father should by warre vindicate the honour of his son


the restitution of the palatinate cannot be procured by treaty for this course hath bin often tried and vsed euen by the prince himselfe but euer in vain
therefore there is now no other meane to be vsed saue the way of warre

the honour of the king and kingdom requires that now these wrongs be fought to be righted by warre the last arrow in necessities quiuer and the onely meane now left of preseruing reputation
he doth but draw on new iniuries who neglects to reuenge the old especially so intollerable as haue been offered to the english
but if now after they haue raised so good opinion hope of themselues in the world they should grow faint and fall backe into their former lethargie they should lose all faith and reputation
cease to shew how magnanimious princes are more bound in honour to recouer the estates of their friends which they haue taken into their protection then their owne goods

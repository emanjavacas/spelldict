brief declaracion of the Lordes Supper, written by the syngular learned man, and most constaunt Martir of Iesus Christ, Nicholas Ridley Bishop of London prisoner in Oxforde, a litel before he suffred deathe for the true testimonie of Christ.
For thy sake are we killed all daye long, and are compted as shepe appointed to be slayne.
Neuertheles in all these thinges we ouercome through him, that loued vs. Anno.
VNderstande (good reader) that this great clearke and blessed Martir, bishop Nicholas Ridley sought not (by setting furthe this notable godly piece of learned worke) the vayne glorie of the world, nor temporal frendship of men for his present aduauncement, muche lesse he hunted hereby for Bishoprikes and benefices, as all his aduersaries (the enemies of Christes truthe and ordinaunce) the Papistes co~monly doo: but hauing consideracion of the great charge of soule committed vnto him, and of thaccompte therof which the iustice of God wolde require at his handes, intending therwithall to be founde blameles in the great daye of the Lorde, seing he was put aparte to defende the Gospel.
he not only forsoke landes, goodes, world, frendes, and him selfe withall, and testified the truthe specified in this boke by his learned mouthe in the open presence of the worlde: but also (to leaue a sure monument and loue token vnto his flocke) he hathe regestred it by his owne penne in this forme ensuyng, and sealed it vp with his blood.
Forasmuch than as he hath approued him selfe no vayne disputour, no wethercocke, nor hipocrite, seyng he hathe willingly geuen his lyfe for the truthe: and inasmuche also as his loue and most constaunt christian conscience speaketh frely vnto thee, gentill reader: beseche thee for Christes sake and thyne owne, lende him thine indifferent heart, and pacient hearyng. [leaf motif] MAny thynges confounde a weake memorie: a fewe places well weighed and perceaued, lyghten the vn+dersta~dyng.
Truthe is ther to be searched, wher it is certayne to be hade.
Though God dothe speake the truthe by man, yet in mannes worde (which God hath not reuealed to be his) a ma~ may doubt, without mystrust in god.
Christ is the truthe of God reuealed vnto man from heauen by God hym selfe, and therfore in his worde the truthe is to be founde, which is to be embraced of al that be his.
Christ biddeth vs aske, we shall haue: searche, and we shall fynde: knocke, and it shal be opened vnto vs. Therfore our heauenly father, the autor and fountayne of all truthe, the botomles sea of al vnderstanding, sende downe (we beseche the) thy holy spirite in to our heartes, and lyghten our vnderstanding wyth the beames of thy heauenly grace.
We aske thee this (O merciful father) not in respecte of our desartes, but for thy deare sonne oure saueour Iesus Christes sake.
Thou knowest (O heauenly father) that the controuersie about the Sacrament of the blessed bodye and blood of thy deare sonne, our saueour Iesu Christ, hathe troubled not of late only, ye churche of Engla~de, Fraunce, Germanye, and Italie, but also many yeares agoo.
The fault is ours (no doubt) therfore, for we haue deserued thy plague.
But (O Lorde) be mercifull, and releue our myserie with som light of grace.
Thow knowest (o Lorde) how this wicked world rolleth vp and downe, and releth to fro: and careth not what thy will is, so it maye abyde in wealthe.
If truthe haue wealthe, who are so stowte to defende the truthe, as they? But if Christes crosse be layed on truthes backe, than they vanyshe awaye straight, as waxe before ye fire.
But these are not they (O heauenly father) for whom make my most moane, but for those sely ones (O Lord) which haue a zeale vnto thee: those meane, which wold and wishe to knowe thy will, and yet are letted, holden backe, blynded by the subtilties of Satan and his Ministers, the wickednesse of this wretched worde, and the synful lustes and affectiones of the fleshe.
Alas Lorde, thow knowest that we be of our selues but fleshe, wherin ther dwelleth nothing that is good.
How than is it possible for ma~ without the (O Lorde) to vnderstande thy truthe in dede? Can the natural man perceaue the will of God? Lorde, to whom thow gauest a zeale of thee, geue them also (we beseche thee) ye knowlage of thy blessed will.
Suffre not the~ (O Lorde) blyndlye to be ledde, for to stryue against thee as thow diddest those (Alas) which crucified thine owne so~ne: forgeue them (O Lorde) for thy deare sonnes sake, for they knowe not what they doo.
They do thinke (Alas, Lorde) for lacke of knowlage, that they doo vnto the good seruice, euen whan agaynst thee they doo most extremely rage.
Remembre, Lorde (we beseche the) for whom thy martyr Stephan did praye, and whom thyne holy Aopstle Paule did so truly and earnestly loue: that for their saluacion, he wished hym self accursed for them.
Remembre (O heauenly father) the prayer of thy deare sonne, our saueour Christe, vpon the crosse, whan he sayd vnto thee: father forgeue them: they knowe not what they doo.
With this forgeuenesse, good Lorde, geue me (I beseche the) thy gra+ce, so here briefly to set furthe the sayenges of thy sonne our saueour Iesu Christ, of his Eua~gelistes, and of his apostles, that in this aforesaide co~trouersie, the light of the truthe, by ye lanterne of thy worde maye shyne vnto al them that loue the.
Of the Lordes last supper do speake expressely the eua~gelistes, Matthewe, Marke, Luke: but non more playnlye nor more fully declareth ye same, than dothe S. Paule, partly in the
As Matthewe and Marke doo agree muche in wordes, so do likewise Luke and S. Paule.
But al. iiij. no doubt, as they were all taught in one schole, inspired wt one spirite, so taught they all one truthe.
Whan eue~ was come, he sate downe wt the .xij. &c.
As they did eate, Iesus toke bread, and gaue thankes, brake it, and gaue it to the disciples, and sayed.
And he toke the cuppe, gaue thankes, gaue it to them sayeng: Drynke ye al of this: for this is my blood of the newe testament, that is shedde for many, for the Remission of synnes.
saye vnto you, will not drynke hencefurthe of this frute of the vyne tree, vntil that daye, whan shall drynke that newe in my fathers kingdome.
And wha~ they hade sayed grace, they went out, &c.
And as they eate, Iesus toke bread, blessed, and brake, and gaue to them, and saied: Take, eate, This is my body.
And he toke the cuppe, gaue tha~kes, and gaue it to them, and they all dranke of it.
And he sayed vnto them: This is my blood of the newe testament, which is shedde for many.
Verily saye vnto you, wil drinke no more of the frute of the vyne, vntil that daye, that drinke that newe, in the kingdome of God.
Here Matthewe and Marke do agree not only in ye mater, but also almost fully in the forme of wordes.
Marke hathe one worde, Blessed: which signifieth in this place all one.
And where Mat+thewe sayeth: Drynke ye all of this Marke sayeth: they al dranke of it
And wher Matthewe sayeth: of this frute of ye vyne Marke leaueth out ye worde (this) and sayeth, of ye frute of the vyne
Now let vs see likewise, what agrement (in forme of wordes) is betwene S. Luke and S. Paule.
Luke wryteth thus: He toke bread, gaue tha~+kes, brake it, and gaue it to them, saye~g: This is my body which is geue~ for you This doo in the remembraunce of me.
Likewise also whan they hade supped, he toke the cupp, sayeng: This cuppe is the newe testament in my blood, which is shedde for you.
The Lorde Iesus, the same night, in the which he was betrayed, toke bread, and gaue thankes, brake, and sayed: Take, eate: this is my body, which is broken for you.
After the same maner he toke the cuppe, whan supper was done, sayeng This cuppe is the newe testament in my blood.
This doo, as often as ye shall drinke it, in the reme~brau~ce of me.
For as often as ye shall eate this bread, drinke this cuppe, ye shal shewe ye Lordes death, vntil he come Here wher Luke sayeth, which is geuen: Paule sayeth, which is broken
And as Luke addeth to the wordes of Paule spoken of the cuppe (which is shedde for you) so likewise Paule addeth to the wordes therof, This doo, as often as you shall drinke it in the remembraunce of me
The rest that foloweth in S. Paule bothe ther and in ye
chap. perteyneth vnto the right vse and doctrine of the Lordes supper, Thus the Euangelistes S. Paule haue rehearced the wordes worke of Christ, wherby he did institute ordayne this holy sacrame~t of his body blood, to be a perpetuall reme~brau~ce vnto his co~myng again of him self (I saye) yt is of his body geue~ for vs, of his blood shedde for ye remission of synnes.
But this reme~braunce which is thus ordayned, as ye autor therof is Christ (bothe God and man) so by the almightie power of God, it farre passeth all kyndes of remembraunces, that any other man is able to make eyther of hym selfe or of any other thing.
For who so euer receaueth this holy Sacrame~t thus ordayned in reme~brau~ce of Christ, he receaueth ther with either deathe or life.
For S. Paule sayeth of ye godly receauours in ye
chap. of his furst epistle vnto the Corinthia~s: The cuppe of blessing, which we blesse, is it not the partaking or feloweship of Christes blood? And also he sayeth.
The bread which we breake (& meaneth at the Lordes table) is it not the partaking or feloweship of Christes bodye? Now the partaki~g of Christes body and of his blood vnto the faithfull and godly, is the partaking or feloweship of life immortalitie.
And agayn of the badde and vngodly receauours, S. Paule as playnly sayeth thus: He that eateth of this bread, eand drynketh of this cuppe vnworthily: is giltie of the body and blood of ye Lorde.
how necessary tha~ it is, if we loue life, wolde eschue deathe, to trye and examine our selues, before we eate of this bread, and drynke of this cuppe: for elles assuredly, he that eateth and drynketh therof vnworthily, eateth drynketh his owne damnacion, bicau+se he estemeth not the Lordes body: yt is, he reuerenceth not the Lordes bodye wt ye honour that is due vnto him.
And that which was sayd, that wt the recept of the holy Sacrament of the blessed body and blood of Christ is receaued of euery one, good badde, either life or deathe, it is not me~t, that they which are dead before God, maie hereby receaue life: or the lyuing before God can hereby receaue deathe.
For as non is mete to receaue natural fode, wherby ye natural life is nourished, except he be borne liue before: so no man ca~ fede (by the recept of this holy sacrament) of the fode of eternal life, except he be regenerated borne of God before.
And on the other syde, no man here receaueth damnacion which is not dead before.
Thus hitherto without all doubt, God is my witnesse, saye so farre as doo knowe, ther is no controuersie among them that be learned, in the churche of Englande (concerning the mater of this sacrament) but all doo agree, whether they be newe or olde: and to speake playne, and as som of them doo odiously call either other: whether they be protestauntes, papistes, Pharisees, or gospellers.
And as al doo agree hitherto, in ye aforesayed doctrine, so al do deteste, abhorre co~de~ne ye wicked heresie of ye Messalonianes which other wise be called Euticheres, which said, yt ye holy Sacrame~t ca~ nother do good nor harme.
Al do al so co~de~ne those wicked Anabaptistes, which put no difference betwene the Lordes table and the lordes meate, their owne.
And bicause charitie wolde, that we should, (if it be possible, and so farre as we maye with the sauegarde of good co~science, mayntenaunce of the truthe) agree with all men: therfore me thinkes, it is not charitably done to burthen any man (either newe or olde, as they cal them) further, than such doo declare them selues, to dissent from that we are persuaded to be truthe, or pretende therto to be controuersies, wher as non suche are in dede: and so to multiplye the debate, the which the more it dothe encreace, the further it dothe departe from the vnitie, that the true christian should desyre.
And agayn, this is true, that truthe nother nedeth nor wilbe maynteyned with lies.
It is also a true prouerbe, that it is euen synne, to lye vpo~ the deuil: for though by thy lye thow doest synne neuer so muche to speake agaynst the deuil, yet in yt thou lyest, in dede thow workest the deuilles worke: thow doest him seruice, and takest the deuilles parte.
Now whether than they doo godly and charitably, which either by their pen in writing, or by their wordes in preaching, doo beare the symple people in ha~de, that those which thus doo teache beleue, doo goo about to make the holy Sacrament (ordayned by Christ him self) a thing no better than a piece of common bread: or that doo saye, that suche doo make the holy Sacrament of the blesed body and blood of Christ nothing elles, but a bare signe or a figure, to represent Christ non otherwise, than the Iuye bushe dothe represent the wyne in a tauerne, or as a vile persone gorgiouslye apparailed· maye represent a kyng or a prince in a playe.
Alas let men leaue lyeng, and speake the truthe euery one, not only to his neighbour, but also of his neighbour: for we are membres one of an other, sayeth saint Paule.
The controuersie (no doubt) which at this daye troubleth the churche (wherin any meane learned man, either olde or newe, dothe stande in) is not, whether the holy Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, is no better than a piece of co~mo~ bread or no: or whether the Lordes table is no more to be regarded, tha~ the table of any earthy man or no: or whether it is but a bare signe or figure of Christ and nothing elles or no.
For all doo graunt, that S. Paules wordes doo require, that the bread which we breake, is the partaking of the body of Christ, and also doo graunt hym that eateth of that bread, or drinketh of ye cuppe vnworthily, to be giltie of the Lordes death, and to eate and drinke his owne damnacion, bicause he estemeth not the Lordes body.
All doo graunt, that these wordes of S. Paule (whan he sayeth: If we eate, it auantageth vs nothing: or if we eate not we want nothi~g therby are not spoken of the Lordes table, but of other common meates.
But now let vs see, wherin the dissen+sio~ dothe stande.
The vndersta~ding of it, wherin it chiefli sta~deth, is a steppe to the true searching furthe of the truth.
For who can seke well a remedie, if he knowe not before, ye disease? It is nother to be denyed nor dissembled, that in the mater of this Sacrame~t ther be diuerse poyntes, wherin men (counted to be learned) can not agree.
As whether ther be any Transubstanciation of the bread, or no any corporal carnall presence of Christes substau~ce, or no: Whether adoracion (due onlye vnto God) is to be done vnto the Sacrament or no: and whether Christes bodye be ther offred in dede vnto ye heaue~ly father, by ye priest or no: and whether ye euil man receaueth the naturall bodye of Christ or no.
Yet neuerthelesse as in a man diseased in dyuerse partes, commonlye the originall cause of suche diuerse diseases, which is spredde abroade in the body, doo come from one chefe membre, as from the stomacke, or from the head: euen so all fyue aforesayed doo chiefly heng vpon this one question: which is, what is the mater of the Sacrament: whether is it the naturall substaunce of bread, or the natural substaunce of Christes owne body? The truthe of this questio~ truly tryed out and agreed vpon, no doubt shal ceasse the co~trouersie in al ye rest.
For if it be Christes owne natural body, borne of the virgine: than assuredly (seing that all learned men in Englande so farre as knowe, bothe newe olde, grau~t there to be but one substaunce) than saye, they must nedes graunt Transubstanciacion: that is, a chau~ge of ye substaunce of bread, into the substaunce of Christes bodye.
Tha~ also they must nedes graunt the carnall and corporal presence of Christes bodye.
Than must the Sacrame~t be adored with ye honour due to Christ him selfe, for the vnitie of the two natures in one persone.
Than yf ye priest do offre the Sacrament, he dothe offre in dede Christ him selfe.
And finally the murtherour, the aduouterour, or wicked ma~ receauing the Sacrame~t, must nedes than receaue also the natural substau~ce of Christes owne blessed bodye, bothe fleshe and blood.
Nowe on ye other syde, yf after the truthe shalbe truly tryed out, it shalbe founde, that the substau~ce of bread is the naturall substaunce of the Sacrament, although for the chaunge of the vse, office and dignitie of ye bread, the bread in dede sacramentally is chaun+ged into the bodye of Christ, as the wa+ter in Baptisme is sacrame~tally chau~ged into the fountayne of regeneration, yet the natural substaunce therof remayneth all one, as was before: yf (I say) the true solucion of that former question (whervpon al these controuersies do heng) be, that the naturall substaunce of bread, is the material substaunce in the Sacrament of Christes blessed body: than must it nedes folowe, of the former proposicion (confessed of all that be named to be learned, so farre as do knowe, in Englande) which is, that ther is but one material substaunce in the Sacra+ment of the bodye, and one only lykewise in the Sacrament of the blood: that ther is no suche thing in dede and in truthe, as they call Transubstanciacion: for the substaunce of bread remayneth stil in the Sacrament of the bodye: than also the natural substau~ce of Christes humane nature, which he toke of the virgine Mary is in heaue~, where it reigneth nowe in glorie, and not here inclosed vnder the forme of bread: than that godly honour, which is only due vnto God ye creatour, may not be done vnto the creature without idolatrie and sacrilege, is not to be done vnto the holy Sacrament.
Than also the wicked, meane the impenite~t murtherour, aduouterour, or suche like, do not receaue the natural substau~ce of ye blessed body blood of Christ.
Finally tha~ dothe it folowe, ye Christes blessed body blood, which was once only offred shedde vpo~ the crosse, being auaileable for the sinnes of al the hole worlde, is offred vp nomore, in'the natural substau~ce therof, nother by ye priest nor any other thing But here before we go any further to searche in this mater, to wade (as it were) to search trye out (as we may) ye truthe hereof in the scripture, it shall do wel by the way, to knowe, whether they that thus make answere solucion vnto the former principal questio~, do take awaye symplie and absolutly the presence of Christes body blood, from the Sacrament ordayned by Christ, and duely ministred according to his holy ordinaunce and institucio~ of the same.
Undoubtedly they doo denye that vtterlye, either so to saye, or so to meane.
Hereof yf any man do or will doubt, the bookes which are writte~ already in this mater of them, that thus doo answere, will make the mater playne.
Now than wil you say, what kynd of presence do they graunt, what do they denye? Bryefly they denie the pre+sence of Christes body in the naturall substaunce of his humane assumpt nature, and graunt the presence of the same by grace: that is, they affirme and saye, that the substau~ce of the naturall body and blood of Christ is onlye remaynyng in heaue~, and so shalbe vnto the later daye, whan he shall come agayne in glorie (accompanied with the Au~gelles of heauen) to iudge bothe the quicke and the deade.
And that the same natural substau~ce of the very bodye blood of Christ, bycause it is vnited vnto the diuine nature in Christ ye seco~de person of the Trinitie.
Therfore it hathe not onlye lyfe in it selfe, but is also hable to geue dothe geue lyfe vnto so many as be or shalbe partakers therof: that is, yt to all yt do beleue on his name, which are not borne of blood (as S. Io. sayeth) or of ye wil of ye fleshe, or of ye wil of ma~, but are borne of God: though the selfe same substaunce abyde styll in heauen, and they for the tyme of their pilgrimage dwel here vpon earthe: By grace (I saye) that is, by the gyfte of thys lyfe (mencioned in Iohn) and the propreties of the same, mete for our pilgrimage here vpon earth, the same bodye of Christ is here prese~t with vs. Euen as for example, we saye, ye same Sunne which (in substau~ce) neuer remoueth his place out of the heauens, is yet present here by his beames, light, and naturall influence, where it shyneth vpon the earthe.
For Goddes worde and his Sacramentes be (as it were) the beames of Christ, which is Sol iusticiae the Su~ne of ryghteousnes.
Thus haste thou hearde, of what sorte or secte so euer thou be, wherin dothe stande the principall state and chiefe point of all the controuersies, which do {pro}prely perteyne vnto the na+ture of this Sacrame~t.
As for the vse therof, graunt ther be many other thinges, wherof here haue spoken nothyng at all.
And now least thou iustly mightest complayne, and say, that haue in opening of this mater done nothyng elles, but digged a pitte, and haue not shut it vp again: or broken a gap, haue not made it vp agayne: or opened ye boke, haue not closed it agayne: or elles to cal me what thou lustest, as neutrall, dissembler, or what so euer elles thy lust learnyng shall serue to thee to name me worse.
Therfore here now wil (by Goddes grace) not only shortly but so clearely· playnly as ca~, make ye to know, whether or ye aforesaid two answeres to ye former principal state chief poi~t dothe lyke me best: yea and also will holde al those accursed, which in this mater (yt now so troubleth ye churche of Christ) haue of God receaued the keye of knowlage, yet goo about to shutte vp ye doores so, yt they the~ selues wil not entre in, nor suffre other that wolde.
And as for myne owne parte, co~sydre, bothe of late what charge cure of soule hathe ben co~mitted vnto me, wherof God knoweth, howe sone shalbe called to geue acco~pte: also now in this worlde, what perile dau~ger of ye lawes (co~cernyng my life) am now in at this p~se~t tyme.
What folye where it tha~ for me, now to disse~+ble wt God, of who~ assuredly loke hope by Christ to haue euerlasti~g life? Seing yt suche charge dau~ger (bothe before God ma~) doo compasse me in rou~de about on euery syde: therfore (God willing) will frankely frely vttre my mynde, though my body be captyue, yet my to~gue my pen (as long as maye) shall frely set furthe, that which vndoubtedly am persua+ded to be ye truthe of Goddes worde.
And yet wil do it vnder this protestacion, call me protestau~t who iusteth.
My protestacion shalbe thus: that my mynde is euer shalbe (God willing) to set furthe syncerely the true sense and meanyng (to the best of my vnderstanding) of God+des most holy worde, not to decline from the same, either for feare of worldly daunger, or elles for hope of gayne doo proteste also due obedience submission of my iudgement in this my wryting, and in all other myne af+faires vnto those of Christes church, which be truly learned in Goddes holy worde, gathered in Christes name, and guided by his spirite.
After this protestacion, doo playnly affirme and saye, yt the seconde answer made vnto the chief question and principal poynt, am persuaded to be the very true meanyng and sense of Goddes holy worde: that is, that the naturall substaunce of bread and wyne is the true material substaunce of the holy sacrament of the blessed body blood of our saueour Christ: and the places of scripture, whervpon this my faithe is grou~ded, be these, bothe co~cerning ye sacrame~t of ye body, also of ye blood.
Furst let vs repete the begynnyng of the institucio~ of the Lordes supper, wherin al ye three eua~gelistes, and S. Paule almost in wordes doo agree, sayeng that Iesus toke bread, gaue tha~+kes, brake, and gaue it to the disciples, sayeng.
Here it appeareth playnly, that Christ calleth very bread, his body.
And that which he toke, after he hade geuen thankes, he brake: and that which he toke and brake, he gaue to his disciples: that which he toke, brake, and gaue to his disciples, he sayed hym self of it: This is my bodye.
So it appeareth playnlie, that Christ called very bread his body.
But very breade ca~not be his body in very substau~ce therof: therfore it must nedes haue an other meani~g.
Which meanyng appeareth playnly what it is, by the next sentence that foloweth imediatlye, bothe in Luke in Paule.
And yt is this: Doo this in reme~brau~ce of me.
Whervpon it semeth vnto me to euident, that Christ did take bread, called it his bodye, for that he wolde therby institute a perpetual reme~braunce of his body: specially of ye singular benefite of our redempcion, which he wolde than procure and purchace vnto vs, by his body vpon the crosse.
But bread reteynyng still his owne very natural substaunce, maye be thus by grace, (and in a sacrame~tal significacio~) his body: wher+as elles the very bread which he toke, brake, and gaue them, could not be in any wise his natural body.
For that were confusion of substaunces, and therfore the very wordes of Christ ioyned with the next sentence folowing, bothe enforceth vs to confesse the very bread, to remayne still, and also openeth vnto vs, how that bread may be and is thus by his diuine power his body, which was geue~ for vs.
But here remembre, haue red in some writours of the contrarie opinion, which doo denye that, yt which Christ did take, he brake.
For (saye they) after his taking, he blessed it, as Marke doth speake.
And by his blessing, he chaunged the natural substaunce of the breade in to the natural substaunce of his bodye: and so although he toke the bread, and blessed it, yet bicause in blessing he chaunged the substaunce of it, he brake not the bread, which than was not ther, but only the forme therof.
Unto this obiection haue two playne answers, bothe grounded vpo~ Goddes worde.
The one will here rehearse: the other answer will differre, vntil speake of the Sacrame~t of the blood.
Myne answer here is take~ out of ye plaine wordes of S. Paul, which dothe manifestlye confounde this fantastical inuencion, furst inue~ted (I wene) of Pope Innocentius after confirmed by the subtile sophister Duns and lately renewed nowe in our dayes, with an eloquent stile muche finesse of wytte.
But what can craftye inuencion, subtiltie in sophismes, eloque~ce or fynesse of wytte preuayle against the vnfallible worde of God? What nede we to striue and co~tend what thing we breake, for Paul sayeth, speaking vndoubtedly of the Lordes table: The bread (sayeth he) which we breake, is it not the partaking or feloweship of the Lordes bodye? Whervpon it foloweth, that after the tha~kes geuyng it is bread which we breake.
And how ofte~ in the Actes of ye apostles, is the Lordes supper signified by breaking of bread? They did perseuer (sayeth S. Luke) in the Apostles doctrin, co~munion, breaki~g of bread.
And again i~ an other place, wha~ they were come together to break bread &c. s. Paul which setteth furth most fully in his wryting bothe the doctrine ye right vse of ye Lordes supper, ye sacra+me~tal eating dri~king of Christes bo+dy blood, calleth it fyue times bread, bread, bread, bread, bread.
The sacramental bread is the mysticall body, and so it is called in scripture·
Now noma~ was euer so fonde, as to saye, that that sacrame~tal bread is transubstanciated and chaunged in to the substaunce of the congregacio~.
Wherfore no man should likewise thinke, or saye, yt ye bread is tra~substa~ciated chau~ged in to ye natural substaunce of Christes humayne nature.
But my mynde is not here to wryt what maye be gathered out of scriptu+res for this purpose, but only to note here briefly, those which seme vnto me, to be the most playne places.
Ther+fore contented to haue spoken thus muche of the sacrame~tal bread, will now speake a litel of ye Lordes cuppe.
And this shalbe my thrid argume~t grou~ded vpo~ Christes owne wordes.
The natural substaunce of the sacramental wyne remayneth still, and is ye material substau~ce of the sacrament of ye blood of Christ: Therfore it is like wise so in ye Sacramental bread.
know that he that is of a co~trary opinion, wil denye the former parte of myne Argument.
But wil proue it thus, by the playne wordes of Christ him self, bothe in Mathewe and in Marke.
Christes wordes are these: after the wordes said vpo~ the cup.
saie vnto you (saieth Christ) wil not dri~ke he~cefurthe of this frute of the vyne tree, vntil shall drinke that newe in my fathers kingdome.
Here note how Christ calleth playnlie his cuppe the frute of the vyne tree.
But the frute of the vyne tree is very natural wyne.
Wherfore the natural substaunce of the wyne dothe remayne still in the Sacrament of Christes blood.
And here in speaking of ye Lordes cup, it cometh vnto my remembraunce ye vanitie of Innocentius his sa~tastical inuencion, which by Paules wordes did confute before, here did promise somwhat more to speake, that is this.
If the transubstanciacion be made by this worde (Blessed) in Marke sayed vpon the bread, as Innocentius that pope did saye: Than su+rely seing that worde is not sayed of Christ, nother in any of the euangelistes nor in S. Paule vpon the cuppe: Ther is no transubstanciacion of the wyne at al.
For wher the cause dothe faile, ther can not folowe the effecte.
But the sacramental bread the sacra+mental wyne doo bothe remayne in their natural substaunce alike, and if the one be not chaunged, as of the sacramental wyne it appeareth euide~tly: than ther is no such transubstanciacion in nother of them bothe, All that put affirme this chaunge of ye substaunce of bread wyne in to the substaunce of Christes bodye and blood (called Transubstanciacion) doo also say this chaunge to be made by a certain forme of prescripte wordes and non other.
But what they be that make the chaunge, either of the one or of the other, vndoubtedly eue~ they that doo write most fynely in these our dayes, almost confesse playnlye, that they can not tell.
For although they graunt, to certayn of the olde autors, as Crysostome and Ambrose that these wordes (This is my body) are the wordes of consecracion of the sacrament of the body: yet saye they, these wordes maye well be so called, bicause they doo assure vs of the consecracion therof, whether it be done before these wordes be spoken or no.
But as for this their doubt (concerning the sacrament of the bodye) let it passe.
Let vs now considre the wordes which perteyne to the cuppe.
This is furst euide~t, yt as Matthewe muche agreeth wt Marke, likewise Luke with Paule, much agreeth herin in forme of wordes: so in the same, the forme of wordes in Matthewe and Marke is diuerse fro~ that which is in Luke Paule: ye olde autors doo most rehearse ye forme of wordes in Matthewe Marke: bicause wene they semed to the~ most cleare.
But here wold knowe, whether it is credible or no, that Luke and Paule, whan they celebrated the Lordes supper wt their congregaciones, that they did not vse the same forme of wordes (at the Lordes table) which they wrote, Luke in his gospel, and Paule in his epistle.
Of Luke, bicause he was a phisicion, whether some will graunt, that he might be a priest or no, and was hable to receaue ye ordre of priesthoode, which (they saye) is geuen by vertue of these wordes sayed by the bishop: Take thou autoritie to sacrifice for the quycke and the dead.
can not tell, but if they shoulde be so strayt vpon Luke, either for his crafte, or elles for lacke of suche power geuen him by vertue of thaforesaid wordes: than wene, bothe Petre and Paule are in daungier to be deposed of their priesthoode, for the crafte either of fyshing, which was Petres: or making of te~tes which was Paules, were more vile, than the the science of phisike.
And as for those sacramental wordes of the ordre of Priesthoode to haue autoritie to sacrifice bothe for ye quyck and the dead, wene Petre Paule (yf they were bothe alyue) were not hable to proue, that euer Christ gaue them such autoritie, or euer saied any suche wordes vnto them.
But will let Luke goo, and bicause Paule speaketh more for hym self, will rehearse his wordes: That (sayeth Paule) which receaued of the Lorde gaue vnto you.
And so he setteth furth the hole institucio~ right vse of the Lordes supper.
Now seing that Paule here sayeth, that which he receaued of the Lorde, he hade geuen them, and that which he hath receaued and geuen them before by worde of mouthe, now he rehearseth wryteth the same in his epistle: is it credible that Paule wolde neuer vse this forme of wordes, vpon the Lordes cuppe, which (as he sayeth) he receaued of the Lorde, that he hade geuen them before, and now rehearseth in his Epistle? trust no man is so farre from all reaso~, but he wil grau~t me, that this is not likely so to be.
Now than if you graunt me, that Paule did vse the forme of wordes, which he writeth: Let vs than rehearse and considre Paules wordes, which he sayeth, Christ spake thus vp+on ye cup.
This cup is the new testame~t in my blood: this do as often as ye shal drinke it, in the remembraunce of me.
Here wold knowe, whether that Christes wordes spoke~ vpo~ the cuppe, were not as mightye in worke, and as effectuall in significacion to all intentes, constructiones and purposes (as our Parliame~t men doo speake) as they were spoken vpon the bread.
If this be graunted, which thing thinke no man can denye: than further reaso~ thus.
But the worde (is) in the wordes spoken vpo~ the Lordes bread dothe mightily signifie (saye they) the chaunge of the substaunce of that which goeth before it, in to ye substau~ce of yt which foloweth after, yt is, of the substaunce of bread in to the substaunce of Christes bodye, whan Christ sayeth: This is my bodye.
Now than if Christes wordes which are spoken vpon the cuppe, which Paule here rehearseth be of the same might and power, bothe in working and signifieng: Than must this worde (is) whan Christ sayeth: This cuppe is the newe testament &c. turne the substau~ce of the cuppe in to the substaunce of the newe testament.
And if thow wilt saye, that this worde (is) nother maketh nor signifieth any suche chaunge of the cuppe, although it be saide of Christ, that this cuppe is the newe testament, yet Christ ment no suche chaunge, as that.
Mary Sir, euen so saye I, wha~ Christ sayde of the bread, which he toke, and after thankes geuen brake and gaue them, sayeng: Take, eate, this is my body he ment no more any suche chaunge of the substau~ce of bread in to the substau~ce of his naturall bodye, than he ment of the chaunge and Transubstanciacion of the cuppe in to the substaunce of the newe testament.
And if thow wilt saye, that the worde (cuppe) here in Christes wordes dothe not signifie the cuppe it self, but the wyne, or thi~g conteyned in the cuppe, by a figure called Metonimia for ye Christes wordes ment, and so must nedes be take~: thow sayest very well.
But praye the by the waye, here note two thinges, Furst that this worde (is) hathe no suche streynght or significacion in the Lordes wordes, to make or to signifie any transubstantiacion.
Seco~dly, that the Lordes wordes wherby he instituted the sacrame~t of his blood, he vseth a figuratyne speache.
Now vayne than is it, that some so earnestly doo saye, as if were an infallible rule, that in doctrine in the institucion of the sacramentes, Christ vsed no figures, but all his wordes are to be strayned to their propre significacio~s: wha~ as here what so euer thou sayest was in ye cuppe, nother yt nor the cup it selfe (taking euery worde in his propre significacio~) was ye new testame~t, but in vnderstanding that which was in the cuppe, by the cuppe yt is a figura+tiue speache: yea also thou cannest not verifie or truly saye of that, whether thou sayest it was wyne or Christes blood, to be the newe testament without a figure also.
Thus in one sen+tence spoken of Christ, in the institucion of the sacrament of his blood, the figure must helpe vs twyse.
So vntrue is it, that some doo wryte, that Christ vseth no figure in the doctrine of faythe, nor in the institucion of his Sacramentes.
But some saye, yf we shal thus admitte figures in doctrine, than shall all the articles of our fayth, by figures and allegories shortlye be transformed and vnlosed.
saye it is lyke fault (& eue~ the same) to deny ye figure, where ye place so requireth to be vnderstanden, as vaynely to make it a figuratiue speache, which is to be vn+dersta~den in his propre significacion.
The rules wherby ye speche is knowen, whan it is figuratiue, wherby it is none, S. Augustine in his boke De doctrina christiana geueth diuerse lear+ned lessons, very necessarie to be knowen of ye studentes in Goddes worde.
If (sayeth he) the scripture dothe seme to commau~de a thing, which is wicked or vngodlye: or to forbidde a thing that charitie dothe require, than knowe thou (sayeth he) that the speche is figuratiue.
And for exa~ple he bringeth the sayeng of Christ, in ye
Except ye eate the fleshe of the so~ne of ma~, drinke his blood, ye can not haue lyfe in you: it semeth to co~maunde a wicked or an vngodly thing.
Wherfore it is a figuratiue speche, co~mau~ding to haue co~munio~ felowship wt Christes passio~, deuoutly holsomlye to laye vp in memorie, that his fleshe was crucified and wounded for vs.
And here can not but maruel at some men, surely of muche excelle~t fynesse of wyt, of great eloque~ce, that are not ashamed to wryte say, yt this aforesaid sayeng of Christ is after S. Austin a figuratiue speche in dede: howbeit not vnto the learned, but to the vnlearned.
Here let any man that but indifferently vnderstandeth the latine tongue, read the place in S. Austen: if he perceaue not clearly Augustines wordes mynde to be co~+trary, let me abyde therof the rebuke.
This lesso~ of S. Augustine haue therfore the rather set furthe, bicause it teacheth vs to vndersta~de that place in Iohn~ figuratyuely.
Euen so surely the same lesson with the example of S. Augustines exposiciones therof, teacheth vs not only by the same, to vnderstande Christes wordes in the institucion of the Sacrament bothe of his body and of his blood figuratyuely, but also the very true meanyng and vnderstanding of the same.
For if to commaunde to eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, and to drinke his blood semeth to commaunde an inconuenie~ce and an vngodlynesse, and is euen so in dede, if it be vnderstande~ as the wordes doo sta~de in their propre significacion: and therfore must be vnderstanden figuratyuely spiritually, as S. Augustine dothe godly and learnedly interprete them: Than surely Christ commaunding in his last supper to eate his body, and to drinke his blood, semed to co~maunde in sounde of wordes, as great and euen the same inconuenience and vngodlinesse, as did his wordes in the
chap. of S. Iohn~: and therfore must euen by the same reason, be lykewise vnderstanden and expounded figuratyuely spiritually, as S. Augustine did the other: Wherunto that exposicion of S. Augustine may seme to be the more mere, for that Christ in his supper, to the commaundement of eating and drinking of his body blood addeth, Doo this in the reme~braunce of me
Which wordes surely were the keye, that opened reuealed the spirituall and godly exposicion vnto S. Augustine.
But haue taried longer in setting furthe ye forme of Christes wordes vpon the Lordes cuppe, written by Paule and Luke, than did inte~de to do.
And yet in speaking of the forme of Christes wordes, spoken vpon his cuppe, cometh now to my remebrau~ce the forme of wordes vsed in the latine Masse, vpon the Lordes cuppe.
Wherof doo not a litell maruaile, what shoulde be the cause seing the latine Masse agreeth with the euangelistes and Paule, in the forme of wordes sayed vpon the bread: why in the wordes sayed vpon the Lordes cuppe, it diffreth from them all, yea and addeth to the wordes of Christ spoken vpon the cuppe, these wordes, Misterium fidei that is, the mysterie of faith, which ar not redde to be attributed vnto the sacrament of Christes blood, nother in the euangelistes nor in Paule, nor so farre as knowe, in any other place of holy scripture? yea and if it maye haue som good exposicion, yet why it should not be aswell added vnto the wordes of Christ vpon his breade, as vpon his cuppe, surely doo not see ye mysterie.
And bicause see in the vse of the latine masse the sacrament of ye blood abused, whan it is denyed vnto the laye people, cleane contrary vnto Goddes most certain worde: for why, doo beseche the, should the sacrame~t of Christes blood be denyed vnto the lay christia~, more tha~ to ye priest? Did not Christ sheade his blood aswell for ye laye godly ma~, as for ye godly priest? If thow wilt saye, yeas that he did so.
But yet ye sacrame~t of the blood is not to be receaued without the offring vp sacrificeing therof vnto God the fa+ther, bothe for the quicke and for the dead: and no man maye make oblacion of Christes blood vnto God, but a priest, and therfore the priest alone (& that but in his Masse only) maye receaue the sacrament of the blood.
And call you this (Maisters) Misterium fidei? Alas alas, feare me this is before God Misterium iniquitatis the misterie of iniquitie, suche as S. Paule speaketh of, in his epistle to the Thessalonians.
The Lorde be mercifull vnto vs, and blesse vs, lighten his countenaunce vpon vs, and be mercifull vnto vs. That we may knowe thy waye vpon earthe, and among all people thy saluacion.
This kynde of oblacion standeth vponTransubstanciacion his cousyn germayne, and they doo growe bothe vpo~ one grou~de.
The lord wede it out of his vineyard shortly (if it be his bles+sed wil pleasure) ye bitter roote.
To speake of this oblacio~, how muche is it iniurious vnto Christes passion? How it can not, but with highe blasphemye and haynous arrogauncie, intolerable pryde, be claimed of any man, other than of Christ hym self? how much and how playnly it repugneth vnto the manifest wordes, the true sense and meaning of holy scripture in many places, especially in the epistle to the Hebrues: the mater is so long, and other haue written in it at large, that my mynde is nowe, not to intreate therof any further.
For onlye in this my scribling, intende to search out and set furth by the scriptures (according to Goddes gracious gifte of my poore knowlage) whether the true sense and meani~g of Christes wordes in ye institucio~ of his holy supper, do requyre any Tra~substa~ciacio~, as they cal it: or that the very substau~ce of bread and wyne doo remayne still in the Lordes supper and be the material substaunce of the holy Sacrament of Christ our saueours blessed body and blood.
Yet ther remayneth one vayne Quidditie of Duns in this mater, yt which bicause some that write now doo seme to like it so well, that they haue strypped him out of Dunces dustye and darke termes, and pricked hym and paynted hym in freshe colours of an eloquent stile: may therfore deceaue the more, except the errour be warely eschued.
Duns sayeth in these wordes of Christ, This is my body this pronowne demonstratyue, meanyng the worde (this) if ye will knowe, what it dothe shewe or demonstrate, whether ye bread that Christ toke or no: he answereth no, but only one thing in substaunce it poynteth, wherof the nature or name it dothe not tell, but leaueth that to be determyned and tolde by that which foloweth ye worde (is) that is by Praedicatum as the logician dothe speake: and therfore he calleth this pronowne demonstratiue (This) Indiuiduum Vagum, that is, a wa~dring propre name, wherby we maye poynt out and shewe any one thing in substaunce, what thing so euer it be.
That this ymaginacion is vayne and vntruly applyed vnto these wordes of Christ, This is my body: it may appeare plainly in ye wordes of Luke and Paule, sayed vpon the cuppe, co~ferred with ye forme of wordes spoke~ vpo~ ye cuppe in Mathewe and Marke.
For as vpo~ the bread it is sayed of al, This is my body so of Matthewe and Marke it is sayed of the cuppe, This is my blood
Than if in the wordes, This is my body the worde (this) be (as Duns calleth it) a wa~dring name, to appoynt and shewe furthe any one thing, wherof the name and nature it dothe not tell: so must it be likewyse in those wordes of Matthewe and Marke vpon the Lordes cuppe, This is my blood
But in the wordes of Matthewe and Marke, it signifieth and poynteth out ye same, that it dothe in the Lordes wordes vpon the cuppe in Luke and Paule, wher it is sayd This cuppe is the newe testament in my blood &c. Therfore in Matthewe Marke the {pro}nowne demonstratyue (this) dothe not wandre to poynt only one thing in substaunce, not shewing what it is, but telleth it plainlie what it is, no lesse in Mathewe and Marke vnto the eie, than is done in Luke and Paule, by putti~g to this worde (cuppe) bothe vnto the eie, and vnto the eare.
For taking the cuppe and demo~strating or shewing it vnto his disciples, by this {pro}nowne demonstratiue (this) and sayeng vnto them, Drinke ye all of this it was than al one to say.
This is my blood, as to saye: This cuppe is my blood meanyng by the cuppe as the nature of the speche dothe require, the thing conteyned in the cuppe.
So likewise without all doubt, whan Christ hade taken bread, geuen thankes, and broken it, and giuing it to his disciples sayed, Take and so demonstrating and shewing that bread which he hade in his handes, to saye than, This is my body to haue saied, This bread is my body
As it were all one, if a man lacking a knyfe, goi~g to his oisters, wold say vnto an other, who~ he sawe to haue two kniues, Sir, praye you lende me the one of your knyues.
Were it not now all one to answer hym, Sir, holde will lende you this to eate your meate, but not to open oysters withall: and holde, will lende you this knyfe to eate your meat, but not to open oysters.
This similitude serueth but for this purpose, to declare ye nature of speche withall, wher as the thing that is demonstrated and shewed, is euidently perceaued, and openly knowen to the eie.
But good Loord, what a wonderfull thing is it to see, how som me~ doo labour to teache, what is demonstrated and shewed by the pronowne demonstratyue, this, in Christes wordes whan he sayeth: This is my body: This is my blood how they labour (I saye) to teache, what that (this) was than in dede, wha~ Christ spake in the begynnyng of the sentence the worde (this) before he hade pronounced the rest of the wordes, that folowed in the same sentence: so that their doctrine maye agree with their Transubstanciacion: which in dede is the very fou~dacion, wherin al their erroneous doc+trine dothe stande.
And here the Tran+substanciatours doo not agree amo~g them selues, no more than they doo in the wordes which wrought the Transubstanciacion, whan Christ did furst institute his Sacrament: Wherin Innocentius a bishop of Rome of the later dayes, and Duns (as was noted before) doo attribute the worke vnto the worde (Benedixit) Blessed but the rest for the most parte, to Hoc est corpus meum, This is my body &c. Duns therfore wt his secte, bicause he putteth the chau~ge before, must nedes saye, yt (this) whan Christ spake it in the begynnyng of the sentence, was in dede Christes body.
For in the chaunge, the substaunce of bread did departe, and the chaunge was now done in Benedixit (sayeth he) that went before: and therfore after hym and his, that (this) was than in dede Christes body, though ye worde did not importe so much, but only one thing in substaunce: which substaunce after Duns (the bread being gone) must nedes be the substaunce of Christes body.
But they that put their Tra~+substanciacion to be wrought by these wordes of Christ, This is my body and doo saye, that whan the hole sentence was finished, than this chau~ge was perfected, and not before: they ca~+not saye, but yet Christes (this) in the begynnyng of the sentence before the other wordes were fully pronounced, was bread in dede.
But as yet ye chaun+ge was not done, so long the bread must nedes remayne, and so long wt the vniuersal co~sent of al transubstau~+ciatours, the naturall substaunce of Christes body can not come: and therfore must their (this) of necessite demo~+strate shewe the substaunce, which was as yet in the pronou~ceing of the furst worde (this) byChrist, but bread.
But how can they make and verifie Christes wordes to be true, demonstrating the substaunce which in the demonstracion is but bread, and saye therof, This is my body yt is (as they saye) the natural substaunce of Christes body: except they wold saye, that ye verbe (is) signifieth is made or is chaunged in to
And so tha~ if the same verbe (is) be of ye same effecte in Christes wordes spoken vpo~ the cuppe, and rehearsed by Luke Paule: the cuppe or the wyne in the cuppe must be made or turned in to the newe testame~t, as was declared before.
Ther be som among the Transubstanciatours, which walke so wylylie and so warely betwene these two aforesaid opiniones, allowing them bothe, and holding playnly nother of them bothe, that me thynkes, they may be called Neutralles, Ambodexters, or rather suche as can shifte on bothe sydes.
For with the later, they do allowe the doctrine of the last sillable, which is that transubstanciacion is done by myracle in an instaunt, at ye sounde of the last sillable (um) in this sentence, Hoc est corpus meum.
And they doo alowe also Duns his fantastical imaginacio~ of Indiuiduum vagum that demo~strateth as he teacheth, in Christes wordes, one thing in substaunce, than being (after his mynde) the substaunce of the body of Christ.
maruailous thing, how any ma~ can agree with bothe these two, they being so co~trarie the one to the other.
For the one sayeth, the worde (this) demonstrateth the substau~ce of bread: and the other sayeth, no not so, the bread is gone, and it demonstrateth a substaunce which is Christes body.
Tushe sayeth this thrid man, ye vndersta~de nothing at al.
They agree wel ynough in the chief poynt, which is the grounde of al: that is, bothe do agree and beare witnesse, that ther is transubstanciacion.
But their processe and doctrine therof do eue~ aswel agree together, as did ye false witnesse before Annas and Caiphas agai~st Christ: or the two wicked iudges against Susa~na.
For against Christ the false witnesses did agre no doubt, to speake all against hym.
And the wicked iudges were bothe agreed to condemne poore Susanna: but in examinacion of their witnesses, they dissented so farre, that all was founde false, yt they went about, both yt wher in they agreed, also those thinges, which they brought for their proues.
Thus muche haue spoken, in searching out a solucion for this principal questio~, which was, what is the material substaunce of the holy Sacrament, in the Lordes supper.
Now least shoulde seme to set by myne owne conceate, more than is mete: or lesse to regarde the doctrine of the olde ecclesiastical wrytours, than is conuenient for a man of my poore learning and simple wytte for to doo.
And bicause also am in dede persuaded, yt the olde ecclesiasticall wrytours vnderstode the true meanyng of Christ in this mater: and haue bothe so truly and so playnly set it furthe in certayn places of their wrytinges, that no ma~ which will vouchesafe to reade them, and without preiudice of a corrupte iudgement wil indifferently weighe the~, co~strue their myndes non other wise, than they declare them selues to haue ment: am persuaded (I saye) that in reading of them thus, no man can be ignoraunt in this mater, but he that will shutte vp his owne eies, and blyndfelde hym selfe.
Whan speake of ecclesiastical wrytours, meane of suche, as were before the wicked vsurpacio~ of the sea of Rome was growe~ so vnmeasurably great, that not only with tyrannical power, but also with corrupte doctrine, it beganne to subuerte Christes gospel, to turne the state, that Christ his apostles set in ye church, vpside downe.
For the causes aforesaid, wil rehearse certayn of their sayenges: and yet bicause take them but for wytnesses and expou~ders of this doctrine, and not as the autors of the same: and also for that now wil not be tedious, will rehearse but fewe, yt is three olde writours of the Greke churche, and other three of the Latine churche, which doo seme vnto me, to be in this mater most playne.
knowe ther can be nothing spoken so playnly, but ye craftye witte furnished with eloquence, can darken it, and wraste it quite fro~ ye true meaning to a co~trary se~se.
And knowe also, ye eloque~ce, crafte, and fynesse of wytte hathe gone about to bleare mennes eies, to stoppe their eares in thaforenamed writours, that men should nother heare nor see, what those autors both wryte and teache so playnlye, that except men shoulde be made bothe starke blynde and deafe, they can not but of necessitie, yf they will reade, and weye them indiffere~tly, bothe heare and see, what they doo meane, whan eloque~ce, crafte, and fynesse of wytte haue done all that they can.
Nowe let vs heare the olde wrytours of the Greke churche.
yeares agoo: a man for the excellencie of his learnyng so hyghly estemed in Christes churche, that he was co~pted· iudged ye singular teacher in his tyme of Christes religio~, the co~fou~der of heresies, the scholemaister of many godly maters, an opener of the hyghe mysteries in scripture.
chap. of S. Matthewes gospel, sayeth thus: But yf any thing entre into the mouthe, it goeth away into the bely, is auoided into the draught.
Yea that meate which is sanctified by the worde of God prayer, concerning the mater therof, it goeth away into the belye, is auoyded into the draught.
But for ye praier which is added vnto it, for ye proporcion of the faithe, it is made profitable, making the mynde hable to perceaue and see that which is profitable.
For it is not the material substaunce of bread, but the worde which is spoken vpon it, that is profitable to ye man that eateth it not vnworthely.
And this meane of the typical symbolical (that is, sacramental) bodye.
Thus farre go the wordes of Origene, where it is playne, furst that Origene speaking here of the sacrame~t of the Lordes sup+per, as the last wordes do playnly signifie, dothe meane teache, that the material substaunce therof is receaued, digested, auoyded, as the material substaunce of other bread meates is, which could not be, if ther were no material substau~ce of bread at all, as the fantastical opinio~ of tra~substa~ciacio~ dothe put.
It is a worlde to see ye answer of ye papistes to this place of O+rigene.
In ye disputacio~s which were in this mater in the Parliament house, and in bothe the vniuersities of Cambridge and Oxforde they that defended transubsta~ciacio~ sayd, that this parte of Origene was but set furth of late by Erasmus, and therfore is to be suspected.
But howe vayne this their answer is, it appeareth playnly.
For so may al the good olde autors, which laye in olde libraries, are set furthe of late, be by this reason reiected, as Cleme~s Alexandrinus, Theodoretus, Iustinus, Ec+clesiastica historia Nicephori other suche.
An other answer they hade, sayeng that Origine is noted to haue erred in som pointes, and therfore faithe is not to be geuen in this mater vnto hym.
But this answer well weighed dothe ministre good mater to ye cleare confutacion of it self.
For in dede we graunt, that in som poyntes Origene did erre.
But those errours are gathe+red out and noted both of S. Ierome, and Epiphanius, so that his workes (those errours excepted) are now so muche the more of autoritie, ye suche great learned men toke paynes to drawe out of hym, what so euer they thought in him to be written amysse.
But as concerning this mater of the Lordes supper, nother they nor yet euer any other auncient autor did euer saye, that Origene did erre.
Nowe bicause these two answeres haue ben of late so confuted and confounded, that it is wel perceaued, that they will take no place: therfore some which haue written sence that tyme, haue forged twoo other answerres, euen of the same molde.
The former wherof is, that Origene in this place spake not of the sacrament of bread or wyne of the Lordes table, but of an other mystical meate: of the which S. Augustine maketh mencion to be geuen vnto them, that were taught the faithe, before they were baptised.
But Origenes owne wordes in .ij. sentences before rehearsed, being put together, proue this answer vntrue.
For he sayeth, that he meaneth of that figuratiue and mystical body, which {pro}fiteth them, that doo receaue it worthi+ly, alluding so playnlye vnto S. Paules wordes spoken of the Lordes supper: that it is a shame for any learned man ones to open his mouthe to the contrary.
And that breade which S. Augustine speaketh of, he ca~ not proue that any such thing was vsed in Origenes tyme.
Yea though that coulde be proued, yet was ther neuer bread in any tyme called a sacramental body, sauing the sacramental bread of the Lordes table, which is called of Origene the typical and symbolical bodye of Christ.
The seconde of the two newe fou~de answeres, is yet most monstrous of al other, which is this.
But let vs grau~t (saye they) that Origen spake of ye Lor+des supper, and by the mater therof was vnderstanded the material substaunce of bread wyne: what tha~, say they? For though ye material substau~ce was once gone, departed by reason of Transubstanciacion, whiles the for+mes of the bread and the wyne did re+mayne, yet now it is no inconuenie~ce to saye, that as the material substau~ce did departe at the entring in of Christes body vnder thaforesayd formes: so whan the sayd formes be destroyed and do not remayne, than cometh agayn the substaunce of bread wyne.
And this say they, is very mete in this mysterie, that that which beganne wt the miracle, shall ende in a myracle.
Yf hade not redde this fantasie, wolde scarcely haue beleued, that any learned ma~ euer wolde haue set furth suche a foolishe fantasie: which not onlye lacketh all grounde, either of Goddes worde, reason, or of any auncient wrytour, but is also cleane contrarie to the common rules of schole diuinitie: which is, that no miracle is to be affirmed and put without necessitie.
And althoughe for their former miracle, which is their Transubstanciacio~, they haue some colour, thoughe it be but vayne, sayeng, it is done by the power and vertue of these wordes of Christ, This is my bodye yet to make this seconde miracle of returnyng the materiall substaunce agayne, they haue no colour at all.
Or elles pray them shewe me, by what wordes of Christ is ye seconde myracle wrought.
Thus ye maye see, that the sleightes and shiftes which crafte and witte can inuente to wraste the true sense of Origene, can not take place.
But nowe let vs heare one other place of Origene, and so we wyll let him go.
Homilie Super Le+uiticum sayeth, that ther is also euen in the foure Gospelles, and not onlye in the olde Testament, a lettre (meanyng a literall sense) which kylleth.
For yf thou folowe (sayeth he) ye lettre in that sayeng: Except ye eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, drinke his blood.
Yf in that place the lettre dothe kil, wherin is co~mau~ded the eating of Christes fleshe: than surelye in those wordes of Christe, wherin Christ co~maundeth vs to eate his body, the literal sense therof likewise dothe kill.
For it is no lesse crime but euen the same and all one in the literal sense, to eate Christes bodye, to eate Christes fleshe.
Wherfore if the one doo kil, except it be vnderstanden figuratiuely and spiritually: than the other surely dothe kill likewise.
But that to eate Christes fleshe dothe kil so vnderstanden, Origene affirmeth playnly in his wordes aboue rehearsed: Wherfore it can not be iustly denyed, but to eate Christes body literally vnderstanden, must nedes (after hym) kill likewise.
The answer that is made to this place of Origen of the papistes, is so folishe, that it bewrayeth it self, without any further confutacion.
It is the same, that they make to a place of S. Augustine, in his boke De doctrina Christiana: Wher as Saint Augustine spea+keth in effecte ye same thing that Origene dothe here.
The papistes answer is this: To ye carnal ma~ ye literal sense is hurtful, but not so to the spiritual.
As though to vnderstande that in his propre sense, which ought to be taken figuratiuely, were to the carnall man a daungerous perile: but to the spiritual man non at all.
Now to Chrisostome, whom bring for the seconde wrytour in the greke churche.
He speaking agaynst ye vnholy vsing of ma~nes body, which after S. Paule ought to be kept pure and holy, as the very te~ple of the holy goost, sayeth thus: If it be a fault (sayeth he) to translate the holyed vesselles, in the which is conteyned not the true body of Christ, but the mysterie of the body, to priuate vses: how muche more offence is it to abuse and defile the vesselles of our body? These be the wordes of Chrisostome.
But trowe that here many fowle shiftes are deuised, to defeate this place.
But in this place neuer fault was fou~de with hym, vnto these our dayes.
And whether this autor was Iohn~ Chrisostome him self the Archebishop of Constantinopole, or no: that is not the mater.
For of all it is graunted, that he was a writour of that age, and a man of great learnyng: so that it is manifest, that this which he wryteth, was the receaued opinio~ of learned men in his dayes.
Or elles vndoubtedly in suche a mater, his sayeng shoulde haue be~ im+pugned of som yt wrote in his tyme, or nere vnto the same.
Naye (sayeth an other) if this solucio~ will not serue, we maye saye, that Chrisostome did not speake of the vesselles of the Lordes cuppe, or such as were than vsed at the Lordes table, but of the vesselles vsed in the temple in the olde lawe.
For here Chrisostome speaketh of suche vesselles, wherin was ye which was called the body of Christ, although it was not ye true body (sayeth he) of Christ, but the mystery of Christes bodye.
Now of the vessels of the olde lawe, the wrytours doo vse no suche maner of phrase: for their sacrifices were not called Christes body.
For than Christ was not but in shadowes and figures, and not by the Sa+crament of his body reuealed.
Erasmus which was a ma~ that coulde vnderstande the wordes and sense of the wrytour, although he wolde not be sene to speake agaynst this errour of transubstanciacion, bicause he durst not: yet in his tyme declareth playnely that this sayeng of this wrytour is non otherwise to be vnderstanden.
Yet can (sayeth the thirde papist) fynde out a fyne subtil solucion for this place, graunt all that yet is sayed, bothe allowing here the wrytour, also that he ment of the vessels of the Lordes table.
For (sayeth he) the body of Christ is not conteyned in them, at the Lordes table, as in a place, but as in a mysterie.
Is not this a prety shifte, and a mystical solucion? But by the same solucion than, Christes body is not in the Lordes table, nor in the priestes handes, nor in the pixe, and so is he here no where.
For they will not saye, that he is either here or ther, as in a place.
This answer pleaseth so well the maker, that he hym self (after he had played with it a litel while, and shewed the fynesse of his wytte eloquence therin) is content to geue it ouer say: but it is not to be thought, that Chrisostome wolde speake after this fynesse or subtiltie: and therfore he returneth agayn vnto the seconde answer for his shoore Ancor, which is sufficie~tly confuted before.
An other shorte place of Chrisostome will rehearse, which (if any indiffere~cy maye be hearde) in playne termes setteth furth the truth of this mater.
Before ye bread (saieth Chrisostome Ad Cesariu~ Mo+nachu~) be halowed, we cal it bread, but ye grace of God sanctifieng it by the meanes of the priest, it is deliuered now fro~ the name of bread, and estemeth worthy to be called Christes body, although the nature of bread tarye in it still.
These be Chrisostomes wordes: wherin praye you, what can be sayed or thought more playne against this errour of transubstanciacio~, than to declare, that the bread abydeth so still? And yet to this so playn a place, som are not ashamed thus shamefully to elude it, sayeng: we graunt, ye nature of bread remayneth still thus, for that it maye be sene, felt, and tasted: and yet the corporal substaunce of ye bread therfore is gone, least two bodies should be confused together, Christe should be thought impanate.
What contrarietie and falshead is in this answer, the symple man maie easily perceaue.
Is not this a playne contrarietie, to graunt that the natur of bread remayneth so still, yt it maye be sene, felt, and tasted: yet to saye, the corporal substaunce is gone, to auoide absurditie of Christes impanacion? And what manifest falshead is this, to saye or meane, that if the bread should remayne still, than must folowe the inconuenience of impanacio~? As though the very bread could not be a sacrament of Christes body (as water is of baptisme) except Christ should vnyte the nature of bread to his nature, in vnitie of persone, and make of the bread, God.
Now let vs heare Theodoretus, which is the last of the thre Greke autors.
He that calleth his natural body, corne, and bread: and also named hym self a vyne tree: euen he the same hathe honoured the Symboles (that is the sacramental signes) with the names of his body and blood, not chaungeing in dede the nature it self, but adding grace vnto the nature.
what can be more playnly sayed, than this, that this olde wrytour sayeth? that although the Sacramentes beare the name of the body and blood of Christ, yet is not their nature chau~ged, but abydeth stil.
And wher is tha~ the papistes transubstantiacion? The same wrytour in ye seco~de dialoge [[undefined span duplicate] [[undefined span duplicate] of ye same worke against thafore+said heretike Eutiches wryteth yet more playnly agaynst this errour of transubstanciacion, if any thing can be sayed to be more playne.
For he maketh the heretike to speake thus against hym that defendeth the true doctrine, whom he calleth Orthodoxus
As the sacramentes of the body and blood of our Lorde are one thing before the inuocacion, and after the inuocacio~ they be changed, and are made an other: so likewise the Lordes body (saythe the heretike) is after the assu~pcion or ascension in to heauen, turned in to the substance of God the heretike meaning therby, that Christ after his assension, remayneth no more a ma~.
To this Orthodoxus answereth thus, sayeth to ye heretike: Thow art taken (sayeth he) in thyne owne snare.
For those mystical symboles or sacrame~tes after the sanctificacion doo not goo out of their owne nature, but they tarye and abyde still in their substaunce, figure and shape, yea are sensibly sene groped to be ye same they were before.
At these wordes the papistes doo startle: and to saye the truthe, these wordes be so playne, so ful, so cleare that they can not tell, what to saye, but yet they will not ceasse to goo about to playe the cuttles, and to cast their colours ouer them, that the truthe, which is so plainly told, should not haue place.
This autor wrote (saye they) before the determinacion of the churche.
As who wold saye, what so euer that wicked man Innocentius the Pope of Rome determined in his congregacions with his monkes and friers, that must be (for so Duns sayeth) holden for an article and of the substau~ce of our faithe.
Some do charge this autor that he was suspected to be a Nestorian, which thing in Calcedon counsail was tried and proued to be false.
But the fowlest shifte of all, and yet the best that they can finde in this mater, whan none other will serue: is to saye, that Theodorete vnderstandeth by the worde (substaunce) accide~tes and not substaunce in dede.
This glose is like a glose of a lawer vpon a decree, ye text wherof beginneth thus: Statuimus, that is, We decree
The glosse of the lawer ther (after many other prety shiftes ther set furthe) which he thinketh will not well serue to his purpose, and therfore at the last to cleare the mater, he sayeth thus after ye mynde of one lawer.
Vel Dic (sayeth he) Statuimus, id est, abrogamus yt is: or expou~de we do decree, that is, we abrogate or disanull
Is not this a goodly and worthy glose? who will not say, but he is worthy in the lawe, to be reteyned of counsail, that can glose so wel, and fynde in a mater of difficultie, such fyne shiftes? And yet this is the lawe, or at least the glose of the lawe.
And therfore who can tell, what perile a man maye incurre to speake against it, except he were a lawer in dede, which can kepe him self out of the briers, what wynde so euer blowe? Hitherto ye haue hearde three wrytours of the Greke churche, not all what they doo saye: for that were a labour to great for to gather, and to tedious for ye reader: But one or two places of euery one, the which how playne, how ful, and how cleare they be against the errour of transubstanciacion, referre it to the iudgement of the indifferent reader.
And now will likewise rehearse the sayenges of other three olde auncient wytours of the latine church, so make an ende.
And furst will begynne with Tertullian, whom Cipriane the holy martyr so highly estemed, that whan so euer he wolde haue his boke, he was wont to saye: Geue vs now the Maister.
boke agaynst Marcion the heretike, saieth thus: Iesus made ye breade, which he toke, and distributed to his disciples his body, sayeng: This is my body.
That is to saye (sayeth Tertullian) afigure of my body.
In this place it is playne, that after Tertullianes expolicion, Christ ment not by calling the bread his body, the wyne his blood, that either the bread was the naturall body, or the wyne his natural blood, but he called the~ his body and blood, bicause he wolde institute the~ to be vnto vs sacramentes: that is, holy tokens and signes of his body and of his blood: that by them reme~bring and firmely beleuing the bene+fites procured to vs by his body which was torne crucified for vs, and of his blood which was shedde for vs vpo~ the crosse: and so with tha~kes receauing these holy sacraments, according to Christes institucion, might by the same be spiritually nouryshed and fedde to the encrease of all godlynesse in vs here in our pilgrimage iournaye, wherin we walke, vnto euerlasting lyfe.
This was vndoubtedly Christ our saueours mi~de, and this is Tertullianes exposicion.
The wranglyng that the Papistes doo make to elude this sayeng of Ter+tullian, is so farre out of frame, that it euen wearieth me to thinke on it.
Tertullian wryteth here (saye they) as none hathe done hitherto before him.
This sayeng is toto manyfest false: for Origene, Hilarie, Ambrose, Basil, Gregorie Nazianzene, saint Augustine, and other olde autors, lyke+wyse doo call the sacrament, a figure of Christes bodye.
And where they saye, that Tertullian wrote this, whan he was in a heate of disputacion, with an heretike, couetyng by all meanes to ouerthrowe his aduersarie.
As who saye, he wolde not take hede, what he dyd saye, and specially what he wolde wryte in so hyghe a mater, so that he might haue the better hande of his aduersarie.
Is this credible to be true in any godlye wyse man? How muche lesse tha~ is it worthy to be thought or credited in a man of so great a wytte, learning and excellencye, as Tertullian is worthilye estemed euer for to haue ben? Lykewyse this autor in his furst boke agaynst the same heretike Marcion, wryteth thus: God did not reiect bread, which is his creature: for by it he hath made a representacio~ of his body.
Now praye you, what is this to saye, that Christ hathe made a representacion (by bread) of his body, but that Christ hade instituted and orday+ned bread to be a sacrament, for to represent vnto vs his body? Now whether the representacion of one thing by an other, requireth the corporal presence of the thing which is so repre+sented or no, euery man that hathe vnderstanding, is hable in this point (the mater is so cleare of it self) to be a sufficient iudge.
The seconde doctour and wrytour of the latine churche (whose sayenges promysed to set furthe) is S. Augustine: of whose learning and estimacion nede not to speake.
For all the churche of Christ bothe hathe and euer hathe hade hym for a man of most singular learnyng, witte, and diligence, bothe in setting furthe the true doctrine of Christes religion, also in the defence of the same against heretikes.
This autor as he hathe writ+ten most pleynteously in other maters of our faithe, so likewise in this argument he hathe written at large in many of his workes, so playnly against this errour of transustanciacion, yt the papistes loue least to heare of hym, of al other wrytours: partly for his autoritie, partly bicause he openeth the mater more fully, than any other doth.
Therfore will rehearse mo places of him, tha~ hertofore haue done of the other.
And furst, what can be more playne, than that which he wryteth vpon the
psalme, speaki~g of the sacrament of the Lordes body and blood: and rehearsing (as it were) Christes wordes to his disciples, after this maner.
It is not this body, which ye doo see, that ye shall eate, nother shall ye drynke this blood, which the souldyours, yt crucifie me, shall spill or sheade.
doo commende vnto you a mysterie, or a sacrame~t, which spiritually vnderstanded shall geue you life.
Now if Christ hade no moo natural and corporal bodies, but that one which they tha~ presently bothe hearde sawe, nor other natural blood, but that which was in the same body, and the which the souldiours did afterwarde cruelly shede vpon the crosse: and nother this body nor this blood was (by this declaracion of S. Augustine) either to be eaten or dronken, but the mysterie therof spiritually to be vnderstanded: than conclude (if this sayeng and exposicion of S. Augustine be true) that ye mysterie which the disciples should eate, was not the natural body of Christ, but a mysterie of the same spiritually to be vndersta~ded.
Christes fleshe and blood was in the olde testament promysed by similitudes and signes of their sacrifices, and was exhibited in dede and in truthe vpon ye crosse, but the same is celebrated by a sacrament of remembraunce vpo~ ye aultare.
he sayeth, that in these sacrifices, meanyng of the olde lawe, it is figuratiuely signified, what was than to be geuen: but in this sacrifice it is euidently signi+fied, what is allready geuen (vndersta~+ding in the sacrifice vpon the aultare) the remembraunce and tha~kes geuing for the fleshe, which he offred for vs: for the blood which he shedde for vs vpon the crosse as in the same place and euidently ther it maye appeare.
An other euident and cleare place, wherin it appeareth, that by the sacramentall bread, which Christ called his body, he ment a figure of his body.
Christ did admytte Iudas vnto the feast, in the which he comme~ded vnto his disciples the figure of his bodye.
This was Christes last supper before his passion, wherin he did ordayne the sacrament of his body, as all learned men doo agree.
epistle to Bonifacius teacheth, how sacramentes doo beare the names of ye thinges wherof they be sacramentes, bothe in Baptisme, and in the Lordes table, euen as we call euery good frydaye, the daye of Christes passio~: and euery Easter daye, the daye of Christes resurrection: whan in very dede ther was but one daye wherin he suffred, and but one daye wherin he rose.
And why doo we than call them so, which are not so in dede, but bicause they are in like tyme and course of the yeare, as those dayes were, wherin those thinges wer done? Was Christ sayeth (S. Augusti~) offred any more but once? And he offred him self.
And yet in a sacrament or represe~tacio~ not only euery sole~ne feast of Easter, but also euery day, to ye people he is offred: so yt he dothe not lye, yt sayeth: He is euery daye offred.
For if Sacrame~tes hade not so~ similitudes or likenesse of those thinges, wherof they be Sacrame~tes, they could in no wise be sacrame~tes: for their similitudes and likenesse commonly they haue the names of the thinges, wherof they be sacrame~tes.
Therfore as after a certayn maner of speche, ye sacrame~t of Christes body is Christes body, the sacrament of Christes blood is Christes blood, so likewise the Sacrament of faithe is faithe.
After this maner of speche (as S. Augustine teacheth in his questiones Super Leuiticum Co~tra Adamantinu~ it is sayed in scripture, that .vii eares of corne be seuen yeares: seuen kyen be vii. yeares, ye rocke was Christ: blood is ye soule: the which last sayeng (sayeth S. Augustine in his boke Contra Adimantinum) is vnderstanded to be spoken in a signe or figure.
For the Lord himself did not sticke to saye, This is my body, whan he gaue the signe of his body.
For we must not considre in sacrame~tes (sayeth S. Augustine in an other place) What they be, but what they doo signifie: for they be signes of thinges, being one thing in them selues, and yet signifieng an other thing.
For the heauenly bread (sayeth he, speaking of the sacramental bread) by some maner of speache is called Christes body, whan in very dede it is the Sacrament of his body. &c.
What can be more playne, or more clearly spoken, than are these places of S. Augustine before rehearsed, if men were not obstinately bent to mayntene an vntruthe, to receaue nothing what so euer dothe set it furthe? Yet one place more of S. Augustine will allege, which is very cleare to this purpose, that Christes natural body is in heauen, and not here corporally in the Sacrament, and so let him departe.
treatise, which he wryteth vpon Iohn~, he teacheth playnly and clearly, how Christ being bothe God and man, is bothe here after a certayn maner, and yet in heauen and not here in his natural body and substaunce, which he toke of the blessed virgin Mary: speaking thus of Christ and sayeng.
By his diuine Maiestie, by his prouidence, and by his vnspeakeable inuisible grace, yt is fulfilled which he spake: Beholde am with you vnto the ende of the worlde.
But as concernyng his fleshe which he toke in his incarnacion, as touching that which was borne of the virgine, as concernyng that which was apprehended by the Iewes crucified vpon a tree, and taken downe from the crosse, lapped in lynen clothes, and buryed, and rose agayn, and appeared after his resurrection, as concernyng that fleshe, he sayed: ye shall not euer haue me with you.
Why so? For as co~cernyng his fleshe, he was conuersau~t with his disciples .xl. Dayes, and they accompanyeng, seing, and not folowi~g hym, he we~t vp in to heauen, is not here.
By ye prese~ce of his diuine maiestie he did not departe: as concernyng ye prese~ce of his diuine maiestie, wc haue Christ euer wt vs: but as concernyng ye presence of his fleshe, he sayed truly to his disciples: Ye shall not euer haue me with you.
For as co~cernyng the prese~ce of his fleshe, the churche hade hym but a fewe dayes: now it holdeth hym by faithe, though it see hym not.
Thus muche S. Augustine speaketh repeting one thing so often: and al to declare and teache, how we should vnderstande the maner of Christes being here with vs: which is by his grace, by his prouidence, by his diuine nature: and how he is absent by his natural body which was borne of the virgin Mary, died, and roose for vs, is ascended in to heauen, and ther sitteth (as is in the articles of our faithe) on the right hande of God, thence (& from non other place sayeth S. Augu+stine) he shall com on the later daye, to iudge ye quycke the dead.
At ye which daye the righteous shall than lifte vp their heades, and the light of Goddes truthe shall so shyne, that falshead and errours shalbe put in to perpetual confusion: righteousnesse shal haue the vpperhande, and truthe that daye shal beare awaye ye victorie, al thenemies therof quyte ouerthrowne, to be troden vnder foote for euermore.
Lorde, Lorde, beseche the hasten this daye, than shalt thow be glorified with the glorie due vnto thy holy name, and vnto thy diuine maiestie: and we shal syng vnto thee, in al ioye, and felicitie, laude and praise for euer more.
For me thinkes, S. Augustine is in this mater so full and playne, and of that autoritie, that it should not nede after this his declaracion, being so fir+mely grounded vpon Goddes worde, and so well agreing with the other auncient autors, to bring in for the co~+firmacion of this mater any moo: and yet sayed, wolde allege three of the latin churche, to testifie the truthe in this cause.
Now therfore ye last of all shalbe Gelasius which was a bishop of Rome, but one that was bishop of that sea, before ye wicked vsur+pacion and tyrannye therof spredde burst out abrode in to all the worlde.
For this man was before Bonifacius yea and Gregorie the furst: in whose dayes bothe corruption of doctrine and tirannical vsurpacion did chiefly growe, and hade the vpperhande.
Gelasius in an epistle of the twoo na+tures of Christ, Contra Eutichen writeth thus: The sacramentes of the body and blood of Christ, which we receaue are godly thinges, wherby and by the same we are made partakers of the diuine nature, and yet neuerthelesse the substaunce or nature of the bread wyne dothe not departe nor go awaye.
Note these wordes beseche you, and considre, whether any thing can be more playnly spoken, than these wordes be agaynst the errour of tra~substanciacion, which is the grou~de and bitter roote, wherupon spring all the horrible errours before rehearsed.
Wherfore seing that ye falshead dothe appeare so manifestly, and by so many wayes so playnly, so clearlye and so fully, that no ma~ nedeth to be deceaued, but he that will not see, or will not vnderstande: Let vs all that doo loue the truthe, embrace it, forsake the falsehead.
For he that loueth the truthe, is of God: and the lacke of the loue therof is the cause why God suffreth men to fall in to errours, and to perishe therin: yea and as S. Paule sayeth, why he se~deth vnto them illusiones, yt they beleue lies, vnto their owne condemnacion: bicause (sayeth he) they loued not the truthe.
For Christ hym selfe sayeth vnto his father: Thy worde is truthe.
The loue and light wher of almightie God our heauenly father geue vs, lyghten it in our heartes by his ho+ly spirite, through Iesus Christ our Lorde.

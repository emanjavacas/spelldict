this second part of the protestant priuate spirit like a infant is at length after long trauaile come to light
may iustly terme it an agrippa because it vvas hardly brought forth
it caused many great and long gripings in the mothers vvombe in the conception and

framing but passed difficulties both greater and longer in the byrth printing so hard it is for an israelite among the aegyptians to conceaue beare such infants
it vvas in danger to haue byn stifled vnder midvviues hands one vvas long sought for hardly obteyned and farre fetched and yet as a stranger not so skillfull but that many errours are committed
if therefore it come to thy vievv maimed imperfect blame not the authour excuse the printer

thou vvilt meruaile hovv this second part gets birth and breath and comes to light before the first
the reason is this like to tvvo tvvins they strugled in the birth and passing the hands of diuers midvviues this fell to the lott of one more ready and skillfull and so got the precedence of vvhich yet in part vvas its due as being first formed composed and that before the other vvas

intended
for supposing the aduersary as common knovvne to vvit the priuate spirit vvithout discussing the quarrell it assaulted him at the first and so aymed to vvound heresy in the head

but vvherfore then is this called the second the other the first part because the matter or subiect so requires this being a confutation of the priuate spirit the ground of all protestancy the other a proofe or declaration that the same spirit is such a ground to the protesta~ts vvhich at the first supposed vvas aftervvard thought fit to be at large proued that therby it may appeare that this priuate spirit is by the sayd protestant doctrine made not only a ground but a sole and vvhole ground of their fayth and religion yea that all other true grounds are for that end by them neglected and reiected
which proofe of being a ground the order of doctrine so requiring

because it is precedent to the reproofe of the same there fore the other part though later composed and diuulged claimes the title of the first this of the second part

in the meane time if this thus hardly brought forth and thus svvadled in the cloutes of many imperfections both of pen and print may giue thee content thy content giue vente and the vente help on to the birth of the other my hope shalbe that as this part may satisfy thee in the disproofe of this supposed false ground so the other vvill more satisfy first in the proofe of the true grounds assigned by catholikes next in the contempt of the same grounds vsed by protestants and that for the establishing of their false ground vvhich in the first part is fully performed

of vvhich if eyther the one or both may ground or co~firme thee in the truth

true grounds of truth this thy good shalbe the fruite desire of my paynes and my paynes shall thinke themselues at thy hands sufficiently requited by thy good prayers vvhich desyre for my selfe and further endeauours all to the honour of god and good of his holy church

chap
of these six meanes which they be
sect

thovgh according to hierome

haereses ad originem reuocare refut are est to reduce heresies to their origen is to refute them that is to shew not only the tyme when they did begin but also the head or fou~taine from whence they did spring is a sufficient proofe both of their nouelty and falsity so to haue shewed the priuate spirit to haue beene the origen mother which hath begot all late heresyes

which as a brood of such a damme haue descended from her which in the first part is fully performed is a sufficient proofe that the same heresyes are degenerate from all diuine verity and are as so many poisoned streames descended from an infected fountaine
and though all who disclaime delude the vsual receaued grounds of christian religio such as are scripture tradition church councels sea apostolike and fathers and appeale euery man to his owne priuate spirit do make this their spirit the orige of their fayth which also in the former part is hope sufficiently and copiously conuinced that the chiefe and prime protestants before cited haue done might suffice to conuince their doctrine of falsity for that it is descended fro a mother of such impiety though say this that hath beene thus proued might be a sufficient motiue to breed a dislike of this priuate spirit and of the doctrine springing from it yet because that out of it all sorts and sects of heresyes especially lately engendred haue issued as so many vipers out of a dunghill and because the confutation of it is the confutation of all heresies in their origen and as it were a brusing of all late nouell opinions in the head or a strangling of them togeather wiih their mother in her wombe for to proue the fountaine to be poisoned is to proue the streame to be infected and to conuince the mother of adultery is to proue the child liable to it is a worke profitable and hope worth the labour to descend into a particuler confutation of this priuate spirit and by speciall and seuerall kindes of arguments such as are the authority of holy scripture the testimonies of auncient fathers the principles of holy fayth the euidency of solid reason the absurdities both doctrinall and practicall that ensue vpon it and the fruits and effects which haue beene produced by it to lay open the deformity falsity and impiety of this priuate spirit and to shew the inconueniences absurdities and blasphemies which ensue vpon the making it the whole ground of fayth the sole interpreter of scripture and the only iudge of all controuersies of faith religion which as is before in the former part shewed all protestants haue

done and yet do

for the better performance of which vndertaken taske and the more both orderly to proceed and more clearely to vnderstand the same as in the former part we proued six groundes of christian and catholike fayth vpon which it is built and shewed that as the catholikes do imbrace them all the protestants do reiect and delude them all so it will not be amisse in this part first before we enter the particuler confutation to propose to the iudicious readers consideratio also six helps or meanes

by which ordinarily god vseth to worke true catholicke fayth in the hart of euery true beleeuer and to shew that as they are all and euery one of them concurring to the true fayth of euery catholik so they are all wanting to all sortes of protestants and to their faith and religion whereby both catholikes protestants may discerne as well by what kind of causes and meanes true fayth is produced as vpon how solid a grou~d and foundation the same is builded and so al may the better be enabled to iudge whether of the two religions that is catholike or protestant be not only more solidly grou~ded but also more diuinely produced

for which we may note that as these six meanes or helpes are necessary to fayth so three of them are necessary in respect of the obiect belieued and three in respect of the subiect belieuing
in respect of the obiect

the first is the materiall obiect or articles to be belieued which as they are supernatural and aboue the capacity of our vnderstanding so are they to reason not euident and cleare but obscure both in their verity that they are true and in their reuelation that they are reuealed by god and therefore are by fayth for the authority of god affirming belieued
and these are the trinity the incarnation resurrection transubstantiation iustification glorification and the rest which we belieue

the second meane is the formall obiect

or motiue why we belieue which is the prime verity reuelation or testimony of god who as he hath reuealed all mysteries that we are to belieue and as we are to belieue them because

god hath reuealed them so did he at the first reueale them all to the prophets and apostles from whome we are to receaue by scripture or tradition all reuelations of all mysteries of fayth whatsoeuer are by any till the worlds end belieued without expectance of new reuelations by any new spirit for so did christ himselfe make knowne to the apostles

all which he heard of his father
and therupon the apostles

are co~manded to preach the ghospell to all creaturs
and all faithfull are sayd

to be built vpon the foundation of the prophets and apostles that is vpon the reuelations made by christ vnto them and by them deliuered by

scripture or tradition to vs

the third meane is the proponent cause or condition necessarily required to our beliefe which as an infallible rule and iudge

is immediatly to propose to vs the verity certainty both of the articles reuealed and of the reuelation of them for as the articles are aboue our capacity and the reuelation may to vs be doubtfull and both are obscure and as the scripture and tradition are not only hard obscure but also mute and vnable either to explicate themselues or expresse to vs the resolution of al doubts which may arise therefore some iudge or proponent cause in respect of vs is necessary which must be not only infallible and vniuersall in it selfe and able without errour to satisfy all doubts but also knowne and visible vnto vs that by it we may know the verity of all both articles and reuelation as also scripture tradition which proponent cause except god had prouided and left vs he had left vs destitute of a necessary meanes to fayth which is to deliuer and declare to vs what god hath reuealed and so had not prouided vs sufficient helps to attaine to the certainty of beliefe and this is the authority of the church of god

or the spouse of christ as afterwards shall be proued
and thus are necessary in respect of the obiect
the materiall obiect what we belieue

the formal obiect why we belieue
the proponent cause to assure vs of the verity both of what why we belieue

in respect of the subiect who belieues are also necessary other three helpes first a speculatiue iudgement of the

vnderstanding grounded vpon credible testimonyes and probable reasons of perswasions which doe make appeare euident to mans natural iudgme~t that this faith is credible and worthy of beliefe and prudently may be accepted as more credible more worthy of beliefe then any other of pagans iewes or heretikes whatsoeuer though it be not as yet for these reasons belieued as true
these euident testimonyes of credibility which according to diuers dispositions doe diuersly moue and perswade some of them one person and some another and which are only humane not diuine and leaue as yet an impression only of euident credibility not of diuine verity as they are in scripture required

thy testimonies are made credible exceedingly so are they ordinarily to men of reason so necessary to their conuersion that the will which is not moued but with reason or shew of reason for nihil volitum nisi praecognitum cannot giue consent to any verity of fayth except it first be perswaded by some direction of these motiues of credibility
wherupon ordinarily those who are conuerted from infidelity to christianity without some one or other of these motiues may be sayd to be too credulous for qui cito credit leuis est corde

he that giueth credit quickly is light of hart as on the contrary they who are not moued by them sufficiently proposed

are stulti tardi corde ad credendum foolish and slow of hart to belieue and thereby are vnexcusable from sinne but they who with desire and deligence with deuotion humiliation and resignation do endeauour and duly doe enquire seeke out the truth of religion are by inuincible ignorance excused from all sinne of positiue infidelity vntill their vnderstanding be conuinced by euident reasons of perswasion that the one religion is false and damnable the other true and infallible
thus these reasons of credibility are the first help or meanes in the subiect to illustrate the vnderstanding and conuince it of the credibility of the thinges belieued

secondly a pious motion affection or disposition of the will which directed by the former motiues of credibility and inspired by the speciall guift of grace either preuenting or infused doth first it selfe giue consent and submit itselfe

to obedience of fayth then doth determinate the vndersta~ding to giue assent to the verity of the mysteries proposed
this pious disposition

first is supernaturall proceeding fro the grace of god

who workes in vs both to will and to acco~plish

and begins in you a good worke and so our first motion to fayth is of grace
seconly it is free proceeding from our free power and will

he that beleeueth and is baptized shalbe saued but he that belieueth not shallbe condemned
and so our free will concurs also to fayth and saluation or resists by incredulity to damnation
thirdly it is necessary to the conuersion of the faithfull is the cause why some who haue slender yet sufficient motiues of credibility weake motions of grace are freely conuerted whereas others who haue stronger both motiues and motion do obstinatly resist will not be conuertd according to that

certaine belieued these things which were spoken by paul certaine beleeued not
and

how often would gather togeather thy children thou wouldest not and this is the second help or meane working in the will

the third and last help or meane in the guift or habit of fayth which
is a permanent guift or quality produced by god infused into our vnderstanding
it doth enable and lighten the vnderstanding which otherwise of it selfe is as able to see and belieue the high mysteries of fayth as the eye without light is to see colours to giue assent and beliefe to whatsoeuer articles are by holy church proposed as reuealed by god

by fayth we vnderstand or belieue that god is
it is the beginning and first ground of saluation iustification by which we first know god

the iustice of god is reuealed by fayth by which we liue in god

the iust liueth by fayth and by which we are prepared to iustification

vvith the hart we belieue vnto iustice we are iustifyed by

fayth
it is sometimes both obtained before grace of iustification be had and also kept after that is lost so that many haue this habit of fayth who haue not the habit of charity

many of the pharises belieued in him but did not confesse him

if should haue all fayth and haue no charity
it may be lost that only by infidelity or refusing to belieue

as it was in

hymenaeus philetus and in those

who erred from the fayth

made shipwracke about the fayth

and fell from fayth

and thus it is lost in all heretikes who fall from fayth into heresy and so loose their habit by which in baptisme they were enabled afterwards to belieue truely
and these three to wit the credible testimony to conuince the vnderstanding to accept the articles as credible the pious affection of the will to encline the will to obedience of faith and the guift or habit of faith to enable both will and vnderstanding to consent and assent to the diuine reuelations are those which are required on the part of the subiect or person who belieues

the order and necessity of the former meanes
sect
ii

the second consideration may be to ponder first

the order and manner of proceeding
secondly the necessity and efficacy of these six helpes or meanes of fayth all as they are compared one with another and all as they haue their operation in vs
and first for the order we may obserue that the ma~ner which by god ordinarily is vsed according to these meanes to prepare and help an infidell or heretike of discretio to his conuersion to true fayth is this
mans vnderstanding by reason of credibility motiues of perswasion is induced and disposed to accept this fayth

as credible and such as in prudence may and is before any other to be beleiued and his iudgement by certaine markes and signes apparent and easy to euery ones capacity is perswaded that this church and company of belieuers is rather then any other the true church of christ by which he is to be directed in all particulars of his beliefe


he is directed by the churches authority how to discerne betweene the verity and falshood of thinges declared and betweene certainty of reuelation diuine illusion diabolicall
and by it is proposed and declared to him what in particuler he is to beleeue as true and what to condemne as false


the wil

is inclined by grace to subiect it selfe vnto obedience in consenting to fayth to determine the vnderstanding to yield assent to fayth


the guift or habit of faith is infused into the vnderstanding that it may yeild a firme and infallible beliefe or assent to the articles of fayth thus made probably credible by reasons of credibility thus proposed by the churches authority and thus made of infallible verity for the authority or testimony of god reuealing and affirming them to be true
in which act of assent consistes the essence and perfection of diuine and supernaturall fayth

by which is apparent both the manner and order how ordinarily god workes true fayth in euery christian by these meanes and also how faith is resolued and grounded vpon euery one of these meanes in particuler

for if we respect the disposing meanes by which we are prepared to accept of our fayth as credible it dependes vpon the exteriour motiues of credibility and so our fayth is resolued into them dispositiuè
if we respect the directing meanes which propose and declare to vs in particuler what we are to belieue our faith depends vpon the authority of the church and so it is resolued into it directiuè

if we respect the efficient mea+nes by which it is wrought in vs it depends vpon the guift or habit of faith and so is resolued into it effectiué

but if we respect the formall meanes and finall resolution why we doe belieue it it depends vpon the diuine reuelatio of god and so is resolued into it formaliter

and finaliter
of which the preparatiue meanes that is the credible testimonies are precedent to faith and leaue only an human perswasion of the credibility of the verityes
the directiue meanes that is the churches authority is also precedent exteriourly proposing what in particuler and why we are to belieue
the effectiue meanes that is the habit of faith doth interiourly co~curre with the will and vnderstanding to the act of beliefe
and the formall motiue or meanes that is reuelation of god is the formall finall and last resolution why we belieue infallibly such verityes to be true
so that if one aske by what we are before prepared and disposed to belieue the truth it is by the credible testimonies if by what we are directed

guided to know the truth it is by the churches propositio if by what we are assisted and enabled to assent infallibly to this truth it is by the habit of faith if for what and why we doe actually formally and finally assent belieue the same truth it is for the reuelation of god
as therefore the samaritans at the first were prepared by the womans relation who told them that surely it was the messias who had told her all that she had done to thinke it probable that he might be the messias and the woman was as it were a proponent or propounding cause to them of him

many of the samaritans belieued in him for the word of the woman giuing testimony that he told me all thinges whatsoeuer haue done
but afterwards hauing heard and conuersed with our sauiour himselfe for two dayes they now sayd

not for thy saying woman do we belieue for our selues haue heard and do know that this is the sauiour of the world indeed
so all christians are first prepared by credible testimonies directed by church authority to the knowledge and certainty of that truth but afterwards when the diuine reuelation it selfe as the word of our sauiour is made knowne to them then do they now formally and finally not for the testimonies of credibility or church proposition but for the diuine reuelation it self giue firme and infallible assent and beliefe to the verityes or articles of fayth

and thus catholike fayth is that which is for probable testimonies accepted as credible by church proposed as infallible by an infused habit effected as supernaturall by diuine verity reuealed as truth infallible and necessary to be belieued
this fayth is that which is the beginning and ground of iustification the way and gate to saluation

vpo which the church of christ is founded and is as the life and soule of it which maketh vs members and partes of christs church we being by it and baptisme inserted into his mystical body which maketh vs certainly infallibly belieue either expresly or implicitè all whatsoeuer articles of sayth god hath reuealed to his church by his apostles which is a necessary meane instrument or dispositio to our iustification and saluation without which none are iustified and

by which informed with charity all are iustifyed which is one entire fayth in all faithfull who for one motiue and by one proponent cause do belieue all one doctrine which being one and entire belieue as they ought eyther all articles of fayth explicitè or implicitè or none at all which by refusing to assent to any one article in which is questioned the ground of all is by infidelity lost to all and to conclude which distinguisheth a catholike from an heretike in that whosoeuer hath this fayth is a catholike and whosoeuer wants it or looses it is an infidell or heretike and so out of state of grace and saluation
and thus much for the order and manner of gods working of fayth by these meanes in vs

secondly for the necessity and efficacy of these meanes though all and euery one in particuler be ordinarily necessary to true and diuine supernaturall faith the credible testimonies as exteriour motiues to conuince our vnderstanding

that it may prudently accept of this faith as credible and worthy of beliefe the motion of grace and habit of fayth as interiour assistants that the will may not resist but piously incline to consent determine the vndersta~ding to assent and that the vnderstanding may obediently yeild assent to the misteries of fayth the materiall obiects as those which we are to belieue and the formall as that why we are to belieue all which are absolutly necessary to make fayth credible free and supernaturall and without them all faith is but humane false or fained yet in respect of vs and of our certainty of beliefe a proponent cause and that infallible which can be no other but the churches authority is most important and necessary
and first that a proponent cause is needfull all grant because faith

being by hearing and hearing by the word of christ some preacher or teacher is necessary to propose and teach vs what is to be belieued by vs for as fayth depends not vpon reason but vpon authority that of god affirming this or that to be true and commanding it to be belieued so this authority thus affirming this verity must be made knowne to vs by some directing or proponent meanes or els we cannot come

to the knowledge of it

that this directing and proponent cause must be infallible so that it cannot erre it selfe

nor propose to vs an errour or falshood to be belieued for a truth is proued for since god requires of vs a certainty infallibility of fayth and this our certainty must be had by some direction and proposition by which it is proposed made knowne to vs what we are certainly to belieue it must needes follow that this proponent cause must be certaine and infallible or els our fayth directed and guided by it cannot be certaine
thence it followes

that they who admit a proponent cause as the protestants do their church and yet do admit it to be fallible and subiect to errour as all of them do their church cannot haue any certaine and infallible fayth at all as wanting a necessary certaine and infallible meanes to propose and teach them this certaine and infallible fayth which is confirmed by augustine who sayth that if gods prouidence rule and gouerne humane matters we may not despaire but that there is a certaine authority appointed by the same god vpon which staying our selues as vpon a sure step we may be lifted vp to god

thirdly this certaine infallible proponent or directing cause is which church that it may infallibly direct vs we securely rely vpon it first iesus christ selected and made it not only his inheritance

which he hath chosen

or his house which he builded and gouerned

or his temple of which himselfe is priest

but also his dearest spouse

vvhich he espoused to himselfe alone in fayth and truth

as a virgin pure and vnspotted without corruption

yea as his owne body and one body with him

vvhich as head he nourisheth cherisheth and sanctifieth making her glorious without spot

and which he hath purchased with his pretious bloud
secondly he priuiledged it first with his owne presence promising to be

with it all dayes euen to the consu~mation of the world
next with the presence of the holy ghost

the spirit of truth that he may abide with you for euer

and shall not depart out of thy mouth and out of the mouth of thy seed and out of the mouth of thy seeds seed for euer
and for what end

that he may teach you all thinges

that spirit of truth shall teach you

all truth
thirdly he armed it with all power and authority

to remit or retaine all sinnes to bind or loose whatsoeuer is to be bound or loosed in earth or in heauen

to correct punish with the rod of correction

to excommunicate and deliuer vp to satha

and to determine all questions or controuersies as it should seeme good to the holy ghost and it
fourthly he established and co~firmed it

as the pillar and foundation of truth that being in it selfe grounded in truth and also grounding others in the same it should stand so firmely

that the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it
fifthly he gaue to it commission and charge

to teach all nations and to preach the ghospell to all creatures
sixtly he gaue vs warrant and security that we might safely heare and obey it

he that heareth you heareth me
seauenthly he gaue vs charge and command by precept of obligation that whatsoeuer

they shal say to you speaking of the scribes and pharisies in moyses chaire but fortiori of the pastours and prelats in peters chaire that doe you
eightly he threats and terrifyes vnder great punishment first of danger and of contempt of himselfe by contemning it

he that despiseth you despiseth me
secondly of infidelity and losse of his fauour and grace

he that will not heare the church let him be to thee as the heathen and the publican
thirdly of hell and damnation for euer

he that belieueth not shalbe condemned

all which doe proue not only an authority and that infallible in the church to direct and teach vs

but also an obligation in vs to obey submit our selues for fayth to the direction and instruction of it
and least any should doubt of this church what it is the holy ghost explicates the meaning of our sauiour tells vs that it is

some apostles some prophets and other some euangelists and other some pastours and doctours to the consumation of the saints vnto the worke of the ministery vnto the edifying of the body of christ vntill we meet all into the vnity of fayth
which pastours he will giue vs according

to his owne hart who shall feed vs with knowledge doctrine
and how shall they feed vs by preaching and proposing to vs the doctrine of fayth for as hearing is a necessary meanes to belieuing

how shall they belieue him whome they haue not heard so preaching and proposing what is to

be belieued by is necessary to hearing so to belieuing

how shall they heare without a preacher by which is apparently proued the necessity and infallibility of church authority for a propounding and directing cause in matters of fayth and religion

all which may be confirmed first by authority of holy fathers among whome will cyte irenaeus

and augustine for the rest
irenaeus that learned doctour and holy martyr sayth vve ought not to seeke among others the truth which we may easily take and receaue from the church seeing that the apostles haue most fully layd vp in her

all thinges which are of truth that euery man that will may take out of her the drinke of life
for which those thinges that are of the church are with diligence to be loued and the tradition of truth is to be receaued

augustine sayth the truth of the scripture is holden of vs when we do that which pleaseth the vniuersall or whole church the which is commended by the authority of the scriptures themselues that because the holy scriptures cannot deceaue whosoeuer feareth to be deceaued with the obscurity of this question let him require the iudgement of the church which without any ambiguity the holy scripture doth demonstrate
in which is affirmed first that all truth is left by the apostles in the church not in scripture only
secondly that the same truth is to be learned and receaued of all by the sayd church
thirdly that the truth thus receaued is most true and is to be loued and followed of all
see more of the fathers aboue in the first part to whome add a confirmation out of luther against himselfe and his followers who sayth that the church neither can

nor ought to teach errours no not in the least thinges since god is the mouth of the church and as god cannot lye so neither can the church

secondly by reason for since of all the rest of the means and rules also of fayth there may be and often is question doubt as for example of the articles which be true which not of reuelation which is reuelation of god which an illusion of the enemy of the motion of the spirit which is of god which of nature which of sathan of the inclination of the will which is a pious disposition and which an

illuding affectation of tradition which is diuine apostolicall or ecclesiasticall which not of scripture which is true which false of true which is the incorrupted translation which corrupted of the incorrupted tra~slation which is the true sense which is false and of the true sense which is to be belieued as fundamentall and necessary which is not to be belieued as fundamentall but only voluntary
of all which since say there euer hath beene and now is great question contentio some infallible directing iudge propounding cause is a necessary meane to end these all like controuersies and to settle and resolue vs in the assured certainty of the one or other or els will the contention be euer endlesse and we in our opinions restlesse
among which seeing no other can be assigned but the church and that god hath giuen so large commission and priuiledge for that end to it as we haue produced it remaines that the church and church authority is of all necessary meanes of fayth the most necessary for vs to settle and satisfy vs in the certainty of our diuine fayth
and thus much of the order necessity of these six meanes and chiefly of or the proponent cause

how the protestants want all these six meanes of fayth
sect
iii

the third consideration is to reflect how that of all these six meanes necessary to diuine fayth

the protestants haue not any one but are defectiue in all
these meanes are either external as the credible testimonies which by euidence of reason conuinceth that such a faith is credible and may prudently be belieued

and church proposition which by the credit of authotity assures that the same is true and is to be belieued both which are externall to the person belieuing or eternall

as the articles which are belieued and the reuelation why they are belieued both which are of eternal verity and certainty or internal

as the pious disposition of the will by grace preuenient and the actuall

assent to fayth in the vnderstanding by the infused guift of fayth both which grace and guift do operate and cooperate to the act of diuine supernaturall and catholike fayth that these say all and euery one of these meanes are wanting in protestants to their fayth beliefe proue

and first that they want all testimonies of credibility

which may perswade any man prudently to accept of their fayth we may suppose and note that these testimonies or motiues are of three sortes

such as may perswade iewes and gentils to become christians

such as may confirme catholikes to continue christians

such as may induce heretikes to returne to be catholikes
of the first sort are many alleaged by ancient fathers dionysius areopagita

iustinus martyr clemens alexandrinus tertullian cyprian lactantius chrysostome augustine against the gentils all cited proued by

valentia
as for exa~ple in respect of christ the dignity of his person the efficacy of his preaching the verity of his predictions and the vertue of his miracles
in respect of christian doctrine the manner of the propagation of it not by power eloquence nobility or liberty but by the simplicity of simple poore and vnlearned mens preaching

and that to a faith aboue reason contrary to the inclination of flesh and bloud
the confirmation of it by miracles

martyrdome prophecies sanctity of doctrine and order of discipline the opposition of it by the violence and persecution of iewes and pagans and by the eloquence

reasons of rethoricians and philosophers all in vaine
in respect of the scripture the antiquity of it as extant before any writings of any philosophers the consonancy of it

in the agreement of the old testament with the new and of both in themselues
in respect of the professours

their excellent wit eloquence learning and vertue in it their conuersions from infidelity to it their wonderfull constancy and fortitude in defending and dying for it
all which haue beene vrged as strong motiues against gentils to conuert them to it
of the second sort which may confirme catholikes

or such as confirmed augustine in his catholike beliefe against the maniches which he recites to haue beene
the consent

of people and nations

authority begun by miracles nourished by hope

increased by charity and confirmed by antiquity

the succession of priests from the seate of peter to the then present bishop of rome

the name of catholike neuer vsurped by heretikes speaking to strangers but vsually attributed by them to catholikes all which did iustly keep me sayth he in the bosome of the catholike church

of the third sort which may reduce heretiks are such as the nicen councell in the creed augustine

and others did alledge to conuince the heretikes of their tyme that is
vnity of the present church with the ancient in doctrine and vnity of the partes with the head by fayth vnity among themselues by charity and to their pastour by obedience

sanctity of doctrine which induceth sinners to holinesse

and conuerts infidells to christianity and sanctity of persons who exercise good workes of piety confirme their doctrine and holinesse by miracles and prophecies

vniuersality in name by which it is called catholike
in place by being or hauing been extended

in preaching or professing to all or most nations

at the least successiuely
in tyme by being ancient in beginning from the apostles and constant in continuing from them vntill this present against al persecution of gentils

iewes or pagans

succession of pastours and prelats who by lawfull succession from some apostolicall sea

or from some who haue authority from it and by lawfull ordination from them who are lawfully ordeined can deriue their succession and ordination from the apostles
these are markes and testimonies which distinguish the true church of christ from al conuenticles of heretikes do conuince euidently that to be the true church where they are to be found and that to be false where they are wanting

which supposed it is to be proued
first that the protestants want all these testimonies of credibility

which should make euident the credibility of their fayth and religion either to pagans to conuert them or to heretikes to reduce them or to their owne followers to confirme them
and first because it will be to tedious to touch euery one in

particuler we will select the most principall and for the first sort which may conuert paga~s it is certaine

that whatsoeuer of the former motiues the protestants can alleadge either concerning christ his doctrine his scripture or his professours to proue christian religion credible to a paga they receaued them all from vs and our church from which they haue receaued what they haue either of christ of scripture of sacraments of christian religion in generall therefore what these proue or confirme they proue confirme our church and doctrine not theirs

for the first of the rest if we seeke vnity of doctrine

among them it is not to be found
they haue not vnity either with the primitiue church and fathers whose doctrine they reiect in free will merit iustification

prayer to saints and most points now in controuersy as in the first part is at large proued nor with any head or supreme gouernour of which sort they admit none on earth but disclaime all supremacy in any person whatsoeuer for matter ecclesiasticall nor yet among themselues

who are diuided into many diuisions and subdiuisions of sects and heresies that long agoe the number exceeded a hundreth now are so many that they cannot be numbred
in all which as they want all vnity so they want all meanes to settle any vnity in that they admit no iudge to decide any controuersy and to silence any persons contentious

if we seeke for sanctity either of doctrine or of persons by holynesse of life or miracles it is not to be expected among them for their doctrine which is for example that euery motion though naturall of concupiscence is sinne as well without as with consent that all workes though the best are sinne that no good workes doe merit that no iustice is inherent but imputatiue that only fayth iustifies that the commandements are impossible that man hath not that god ordaines and creates men to saluation or damnation without respect to their endeauour or workes this doctrine say is a speciall retractiue to detaine any man from attaining to any sanctity and perfection of life as impossible and not in his power
for any kind of miracles

they are so

destitute of them to confirme their new doctrine that they disclaime all and because they haue none they affirme that none are now wrought or if any be wrought that they are false feygned or diabolicall
for holinesse of life they confesse it to be so far from them that as

luther confesseth men are dayly worse being possessed now with seauen diuells more then before yea with whole troupes of diuells and are more couetous crafty cruell and wicked then when they were papists
and the like is confessed by caluin musculus and others cyted by

becanus and the protestants apology
if we seeke for vniuersality they are ashamed to stile themselues by the name catholike

which is vniuersall but by the name of protestant or for distinction of protestants by the name lutheran caluinist

or the like
vniuersality of place they cannot challenge because their doctrine neuer extended out of the limits of a few northern countryes in europe nor euer entred africa

asia or america
vniuersality of tyme they cannot chalenge because their church had its first being but about an hundred yeares agoe

and this so apparently that we can nominate the yeare when the authour who the place where the opinions what the mantainers and abetters by whome this doctrine had first being in the world and the opposers who at first did yet continue to gainsay it so as they disclaime expresly from this marke not only denying it to be any marke of the church but also confessing that their church was according to some of them seauen hundred to others a thousand to others twelue hundred to others foureteene hundred yeares euer from christ as before is proued either not at all or altogether latent and inuisible

if we seeke for succession of ordination from the apostles they either beg it from the roma church which they account antichristian or els take vp a new one at their owne handes and are prelates and pastours of their owne creation and for want of ordinary vocation from christ are content with an extraordniary of their owne inuention
by which

and much more for breuity omitted is euident that all testimonyes of credibility sufficient to make their doctrine seeme probable and worthy of credit are wanting

to them and their church



that the protestants want the two externalll meanes of fayth which is proposition by which they should be assured confirmed in the certainty of their diuine reuelation mysteries reuealed in the certainty of their spirit and motions by it and in the certainty of their scripture and meaning of it is proued because whether we take the church authoritatiue for the chiefe pastours and prelates by whose authority it is gouerned or representatiue for the general councels in which the whole body in the assembly of bishops is represented or collectiue for the whole multitude of all faythfull belieuers through the whole world dispersed take it say in which of these senses you will in all which it is the true church of god and of infallible authority yet in none of these doe the protestants receaue any infallible direction or confirmation fro it
for if we respect their pastours and prelates

they are not directed by them or obedient in fayth to them but by the liberty and priuiledge of their spirit euery priuate person hath authority to censure and iudge them
if we respect generall councells they disclaime all as before is proued

or if they approue any it is so farre as their decrees do agree with the fancy of their spirit to which they subiect them and so longe as they are pleased to obserue what is comma~ded by them in which they will be free without obligation to obey them

if we respect the whole body of the church they in their generall tenents doe generally hould that it may erre and faile in doctrine and fayth and for practise do boldly affirme that for many ages it hath fallen and failed not only in doctrine of idolatry superstition and heresy but also in very extancy and being of a church as hauing beene inuisible not extant but dead buried and corrupted for so many ages togeather as in the first part is proued and thus they cut off al infallible authority of church proposition which more then the other meanes

they do in plaine tearmes expresly reiect and condemne


that the protestants want the first internall means of faith that is a pious disposition or inclination to belieue

what is proposed by the church as reuealed by god is proued because as a pious inclination of the will moued by the grace of god doth apply and determine the vnderstanding of a willing and well disposed person either to labour and seeke out such motiues testimonies as do make the truth of religion seeme probable or to assent to such as are already proposed vnto it

so the obstinate disposition of a willful protestant doth refuse to giue any credit or beliefe to any reasons though neuer so euident or to any definition of the church though euery way most certaine but resolues with out amendement to persist in his preiudicate opinion notwithstanding any reason or authority to the contrary
by which his obstinacy


he fals into heresy by willfully following his owne opinion which he chooses and carelesly conte~ning the authority of the church

in that it defines

he looseth his fayth which he receaued in baptisme fals into infidelity partaking with heretikes

he belieues no articles of fayth to which he assentes though truly firmly

and for the testimony of god by any diuine and catholike fayth which depends vpon an infallible meane that is church proposing authority but by humane fayth wholy relying and lastly resoluing his beliefe eyther vpon the authority of some deceauing maister or vpon the testimony of some wrested scripture or vpon the euidency of some deluding notes and markes or vpon the seeming apparency of his owne spirit

and conceit

he separates himselfe from the vnion of the body of christ from the benefit of the merits of his passion from the communion of his saints both in earth and heauen and from all participation of hope of glory in gods kingdome to come so remaines as a dead member cut from the body as a dry bough deuided from the tree as a darke glimse of light separated from the sunne as a small streame stopped from the current of the fountaine all which as they do presently decay and dry or come to nothing so he


that the protestants want the two internall meanes and help of fayth that is the infused and permanent guift of fayth inherent in the vnderstanding and both enabling

and illuminating it to the producing of the act of diuine supernaturall fayth is proued because protestants who hold that fayth doth iustify and that iustification is not by any inherent guif and quality but by the extrinsecall fauour of god not imputing our sinnes vnto vs must needs by consequence hould so for the most part do hould that there are no infused and permanent guiftes or habits of fayth which concurre or help to our iustification but that all is wrought by the motion of a transeunt spirit which motio as it worketh according to them in them by it selfe only wholy all internall good workes without any cooperatio of man or mans freewill so it is only a motion which worketh in whome it will when it will and how it will al and whatsoeuer it wil in man to his iustification and saluation by which it is euident that as in all their opinions they are neyther constant nor permanent but are wafted with euery wind of new doctrine and so fly from the beliefe of one thing to another so they are not guided by any permanent guift or quality

but by certaine flashes motions of an vncertaine spirit which leads them from one vncertainty to another and so leaues them in al vncertaine


that the protestants want the first of the eternall meanes or helps of fayth that is the materiall obiects or articles of beliefe which are to be belieued as reuealed by christ vnto the apostles and by the apostles left to their successours and by them to vs and posterity is proued

because they belieue many thinges as obiects of fayth which are not reuealed eyther in scripture or traditions of which are many instances giuen in the former parte so do they not belieue many articles which are reuealed both in scripture and tradition for which cause they reiect all tradition and in it many mysteries of fayth which the apostles left only by tradition

and refuse many partes of scripture and that chiefly because they containe many points of doctrine which they will not belieue

because as they admit many points of doctrine into the number of their articles of fayth which the ancient church condemned for heresies as contrary to apostolicall doctrine witnesse

the ancient condemned heresies of heluidius vigilantius arius iouinian and others by them reuiued so they co~demne many pointes of doctrine as erroneous superstitious or idolatrous which the ancient church receaued for articles of fayth as agreable to apostolicall tradition witnesse all the poyntes of doctrine which the magdeburgenses and others before cyted condemne as errours and staines in the ancient fathers in euery age since christ in both which they erre in the materiall obiects of fayth as well in receauing condemned heresies for apostolicall verities as in co~demning receaued apostolicall verities reuealed by christ for erroneous heresyes


because as they admit speciall fayth only whose obiect is only their remission of sinnes and iustification for diuine fayth by which they are iustified so all other fayth by which they belieue for example the trinity incarnation passion and resurrection and ascension of christ with the rest of the articles of faith vsually belieued they acknowledge for no other but for a general faith common as well to the damned and diuells as to them which faith in the diuel and damned as it is no voluntary and free act proceeding from a pious disposition of the will nor a diuine and supernaturall worke depending vpon any authority of god reuealing but a meere naturall and necessary act of conuincing their vndersta~ding eyther by force of experience or by euidence of reason or by apparent and euident notes of credibility or by some manifestly knowne testimonies of god of the verity of that which they belieue and tremble at so in the same manner their faith of the same articles by their owne confession is not diuine but a meere humane fayth grounded vpon some generall receaued opinion or vpon some meere human authority and so what they conceaue of the generall articles of faith

they do not receaue them as any articles of doctrine and supernaturall fayth but as generall receaued positions humane coniectures and their owne and chosen opinions


that the protestants want all diuine reuelation for which as the formall cause and the finall resolution they

should belieue al which is by god reuealed is proued

because what they belieue they belieue not for that it was reuealed to the apostles by the holy ghost eyther at pentecost when it did visibly teach and confirme them

or in successe of tyme when vpon occasion as at the conuersion of gentils it did reueale to them all the mysteries euer after to be belieued which reuelation made to the apostles is the formall cause of fayth nor yet for that it is proposed to them by church infallible authority as a condition necessary to know what is reuealed but for that it is reuealed to them a new by their owne priuate spirit from which they receaue all their directions and certainty both what is reuealed why it is reuealed and also by what meanes it is reuealed

because the meanes by which christ doth manifest and declare vnto vs his diuine reuelations they eyther plainely reiect or wholy subiect to their priuate spirit for the authority of traditions by which part of the diuine reuelations are deliuered to vs and the proposition of the church by which we are secured of the certainty of them they reiect and deny
the authority of the scripture which is an other meane by which god hath reuealed his truth and which they chalenge as the only means both of knowledge certainty of diuine reuelations they wholy subiect to their priuate spirit by which they are assured which is true canon which is true edition which true tra~slation which true sense of it
and so for diuine reuelation they haue neyther any at all nor yet any meanes to know or attaine vnto it
and thus much of the protestants want of all the necessary helps meanes by which true and diuine supernaturall catholike fayth is produced conserued and increased in the soule of euery faithfull belieuer and member of christs holy body and church

how the catholikes and protestants differ in these six meanes and how the protestants make their priuate spirit the only meanes of all
sect
iiii

the fourth consideration is to reflect vpon the aduantage which we catholiks haue against the protesta~ts and the difference that is betweene vs and them in these meanes of fayth and how that the protestants do substitute one only deluding and deceitfull meanes that is this their priuate spirit in place of all the six former meanes of fayth

and first for the materiall obiect they professe to belieue


only the doctrine which is reuealed in scripture

that only which is reuealed in that one parte of scripture which they are pleased to accept as scripture by their spirit

that only in that part of scripture which is according to their preco~ceaued opinion so interpreted by their spirit so that scripture alone and that not in whole but in part and that part of scripture as it is expounded by their priuate spirit containes all the articles of their fayth
we catholiks do professe to belieue first al that which haue been wrot by the apostles or prophets in holy scripture that in the whole bookes of scripture as anciently they were by a councell of carthage

augustine others receaued all in that sense as it was by ancient church expounded

all that which hath been by the same apostls deliuered to posterity by word of mouth and tradition

all that which hath beene declared to vs out of scripture or tradition

by definition of generall councells


all that which by continuance of practise hath beene by holy church euer reuealed


all that which by vnanimous consent of holy and learned doctours fathers and saints hath beene belieued in this we differ and haue the aduantage for the articles we belieue

secondly for the formall obiect of finall resolution of fayth they belieue what they belieue

eyther for that their sense doth so perceaue it or for that their reason doth so persuade it or for that their priuate spirit doth so suggest it and so they make their sense or their reason or their owne priuate spirit and phantasie the formall motiue and finall resolution of their fayth
we belieue what we do belieue for that god hath reuealed it and that not a new and to some one in particuler but anciently to the apostles

and by them generally to all their successours and by successio to vs so that our doctrine and our beliefe of it is grounded not vpon any our owne sense our owne reason our owne priuate conceit all most fallible and most subiect to illusion and deceit but vpon gods diuine reuelation as he is the prime verity and verity it selfe and that not newly but of ancient euer since christ reuealed that not personal

made to me or one alone but apostolical first reuealed to the apostles themselues that not priuate to euery one seuerally but generall to all faithfull vniuersally that

not interrupted at certaine tymes by fits and to certaine persons made knowne but continued

by succession at all times by all faithfull and in all places receaued that not fallible without ground subiect to priuate illusion but most infallibly grounded vpon diuine reuelation and church proposition subiect neither to be deceaued

nor yet do deceaue and in this we differ

and haue the aduantage for the meanes of fayth eternall

thirdly for the inward assistance of gods grace and the cooperation of it they challenge only certayne motions or flashes of a fickle spirit which whether it be by illumination or illusion whether of grace or nature whether supernaturall of god sensuall of nature or diabolicall of sathan they haue no meanes to discerne or ground to be certaine and by it as dust by a whirle wind they are carryed vp and downe in a round without freedome reason

or operation of their owne to what fancy and conceit it violently wheels and forces them
we are assisted and enabled by the diuine guift of an internall and permanent spirit

or habit of faith which infused into vs and alwayes remayning in vs is at any instant ready with vs and the cooperation of grace in vs to worke both a pious inclination of the will to dispose it without obstinacy obediently to consent and also an actuall assent of the vnderstanding illuminating and enabling it firmely to assent to what is reuealed and proposed
also we admit and receaue besides this habituall grace other actuall and diuers motions of grace and of it some either excitant first to excite moue vs or adiuuant to assist vs being moued some either operant which workes in vs without vs and our cooperation or cooperant which workes in vs togeather with vs and our cooperation with it some either sufficient by which we are enabled to be conuerted or efficient by which we are actually conuerted
and in this we differ from them and haue the aduantage for the meanes of faith internall both for the will and vnderstanding

fourthly for the credible testimonies and motiues of persuasion

which may in reason persuade any man prudently to accept any religion as worthy of credit they haue not any which may either induce any which was neuer of it nor reduce any which are fallen from it or establish any who are entred into it that their faith doctrine and religion is credible as is before proued
we haue many those forcible reasons perswasions and credibilities which may in prudence persuade any pagan neuer admitted to it or heretike reuolted from it or catholike setled in it that our faith doctrine religion and church may and ought prudently to be accepted is credible and worthy of beliefe
we haue

vnity with the ancient and primitiue church with the learned and holy doctours and fathers with the holy saints and martyrs whose faith and life we professe to imbrace imitate
we haue vnity with one head our chiefe bishop and pastour whose definitiue sentence doth resolue our doubts

doth decide our controuersies doth end our contentions in faith and manners
we haue vnity of faith among our selues

all of vs though distant in place though different in manners though contending for temporall state

or dominion yet liuing and agreeing in obedience to one spirituall superiour in vnity of one faith in conformity of one seruice sacraments and ceremonies
we haue sanctity and holynesse both of doctrine which giues holy precepts

and rules to auoid sinne for the loue of god feare of hel to seeke perfection by mortification internall supressing our and and externall taming our passions affections with pennance of fasting watching discipline and the like
and also of good life

by frequent exercise of prayer meditation contemplation by dayly practise of pennance of patience in persecution by perfect resignation to holy obedience pouerty chastity
we haue miracles

those frequent apparent of prophesying curing of all diseases raising dead dispossessing of diuels the like all wrought in confirmation either of our faith or sanctity all for the conuersion of pagans and heretikes of which in all ages tymes we haue many memorable of most nations now christian conuerted to our religion
we haue vniuersality

not only of name by retayning the title of catholikes by which we are vsually distinguished from al sects no sect doth vsurpe it to distinguish them one from another but also of place

as being generally dispersed in all the parts of the world europe asia africa america and also of tyme

as being reputed the old religion and being indeed so old as haue byn yeares since christ his apostles who institued and imbraced it
we haue continued succession and ordination of prelates and bishops manifestly orderly deduced

without interruption of persons or chang of doctrine by a perfect enumeration of successours apostles and apostolical seas vntill this present tyme these our present prelates patriarches and popes
we haue the rare examples of millions of martyrs

confessours virgins who haue with their bloud life defended and honoured our confessed faith doctrine the strange punishments of persecuting pagans iews heretikes who haue with their sword and cruelty opposed and persecuted it
in all which we differ from them and haue the aduantage of them in credible motiues


for infallible proponent cause as they do not require or assigne any

yea as before do expresly reiect all chiefly the true that is church authority so they cannot produce any which either can be a proponent cause or if it could is yet either infallible or so much as credible for them selues and their religion
for their scripture is not to them a proponent but if it were true scripture a reuealing cause because in it is reuealed truth of which reuelatio there is need of a proponent cause to declare which is scripture which is among many the true sense of it
their priuate spirit which yet they make their proponent cause is so farre from being either infallible or credible that it is not only most fallible and subiect to deceaue yea and actually doth deceaue and hath deceaued so many but also most incredible without any apparence of probability eyther to them who haue it or to others who follow it that it can be true or direct

and declare any truth at all
we haue a proponent cause so certaine and infallible which is church authority that it hath for the infallibility of it the predictions of prophets the promises of christ the declaration of the apostls the confirmation of miracles the approbation of holy fathers the practise of all antiquity what not all to proue the verity and infallibility of it in directing and declaring to vs what and why we are to belieue
and in this proponent cause also we differ and that principally from the protestants and so haue the aduantage prerogatiue ouer them in the externall meanes and so in all the meanes required to fayth

for the priuate spirit in particuler if it were a sole necessary ground

meanes of fayth as the protestants without ground suppose it if euery christia lawfully might necessarily ought to rely vpon it which yet none can for the certainty of his fayth religion if it were a secure ground to build vpon and a certaine meanes as it is not to attaine to true fayth and saluation yet with as great reason yea with more probability might we catholikes both chalenge it rely vpon it then the protestants may or ca

and
for the certainty of the spirit that they haue infallibly

the spirit of god more then we what can they chale~ge for it more then we what certainty can they claime more then we if they alleadge their bare word say they haue it we can alleadge ours and say also we haue it
if they alleadge scripture say they haue it for them we also can alledge the same and say we haue it for vs yea and had it before them for that they had what they haue of it from vs
if they alleadge they haue the true sense of scripture for them and their priuate spirit we can alleage we haue the same and the same meanes to attaine it as they many of vs haue as great learning and knowledge in tongues as they as great a care and desire of truth as they as diligent paines and industry as they as feruent prayer and deuotion to find and obtaine it as they
if they alleadge the sense and feeling of this spirit within them we can alleadge and feele as much sensible deuotion and more spirituall as many inspiratio~s illuminations these more certain as great promptnes and readines to obey gods motions that with more humility then they yea in all these we haue and can alleadge more then they

the conformity in iudgement with the ancient fathers councels and church with whome we agree

the direction and authority of our holy mother the spouse of christ our church which we obey

the subordination and vnion of our selues with our pastours superiours of the church to whome we are subiect subordinate
and all this haue we more then they all making vs more certaine then they all better grounded then they

so that we may confidently say with the apostle in quo quis audet audeo ego
vvhat they dare we dare what they can we can what they may chalenge for the probability of their spirit we can may chalenge the same yea more then they plus ego with more reason and probability vpon better safety security
in the certainty therfore of this spirit if it be secure we are equall with them yea many degrees aboue them

secondly

for the necessity of hauing the true spirit of god in vs and the efficacy or effect of the operation of it with vs we catholikes are so far from denying either that

we hould a necessity and that absolute of both affirming that as a principle of our faith that no person whatsoeuer ca truly and duly belieue any article of faith much lesse al nor do any one worke auailable to saluation

much lesse saue his soule without the special presence assista~ce of the grace or spirit of god in him
in as much therfore as concerns the necessary being and working of this spirit of grace of god in vs in some thinges we and the protestantes agree in other we differ
we agree
in that both of vs graunt and require an operation and assistance of this spirit of god not only to true faith but also to good life
in that both of vs do graunt require this operatio to be so necessary in euery one that neither right faith nor vpright life can be attained or performed but by it that as the prime principal cause and agent

in that both of vs do graunt require this necessary and operating spirit to be so priuate particuliar internall in euery one that it hath an effectual operation or cooperation in him that so effectual that to it is attributed the effect of our conuersion saluation
and thus farre we agree

thirdly
we differ fro them in these

in the name vsual manner of appellation for we cal it the grace of god which as before

is of diuers sortes some gratis giuen as the guift of languages cures some iustifying as faith hope charity some actuall as excitant adiuuant operant cooperant sufficient effectual the rest before mentioned
they call it the spirit or priuate spirit or motion of god as inspiring and working whatsoeuer good is wrought in them

we differ in the extension of it for we affirme this grace to be extended offered and giuen sufficiently though not effectually

to all so that all and euery one of reason haue sufficient meanes and ability to know god by faith and to loue him by charity so far as is needfull for their saluation
they affirme their spirit to be restrayned offered and giuen only to the elect faithfull whome they make all one and that all others neither haue nor can haue it

but are by the absolut will and decree of god debarred from it therby made incapable of it

we differ in

the manner of operation of it for we affirme that grace doth worke or cooperate with vs and we with it so that the grace of god and our as two concurring causes though grace the more principall do ioyntly effect and produce euery good worke of faith hope or charity or the rest in vs whereby our good works haue of grace that they are diuine supernaturall and of our selues that they are voluntary and free of both that they are meritorious of more grace present in vs and of glory in heauen to come to vs
they doe attribute so much to the worke of their spirit in them that they take away all cooperation of our in vs wherby they make man as dead without all action or operation to any spirituall and good workes make the spirit whole worker of all in man

fourthly
we differ in the nature and permanency of this grace or spirit

for we acknowledge grace to be an inherent quality permanent guift infused into our soule which doth enlighten enable our vnderstanding to giue assent by faith to the diuine mysteries proposed and inspire our will to be sorrowfull by contrition for our sins committed which guift once infused is not so permanent perpetuall but that the habit of charity is lost by mortall sinne against charity the habit of hope by desperation against hope the habit of faith by infidelity against faith
they or many of the deny all infused guifts of faith hope charity or the rest admit only a transeunt motion or operatio of the spirit which working in man without mans cooperation when what how and in whome it pleaseth is neuer totally or finally lost after it be receaued doth make a man alwayes faythfull and beloued of god and doth giue that vertue to all his workes though neuer so bad that they make them gratefull and acceptable to him so that according to them no worke of a faithfull man though neuer so bad can make any enmity betweene god him god neither imputing it as an offence to him

nor man incurring the displeasure of god for it

fiftly
we differ in the effect and operation assigned to it for we assigne the function and office for example

of the guift of faith to be the eleuation enabling of our vnderstanding to giue assent to what is reuealed by god deliuered in scripture or tradition and proposed by church authority of the guift of hope to be the inflammation of the soule to loue god as our chiefest end to desire him as our greatest good to hope for him as our good absent and to delight in him as our good present of the guift of charity or grace to be the forgiuenes of our sinnes the sanctification of our soule adoption to be the sonnes of god title and right to the kingdome of heauen and a valew dignity of merit to our good workes

they assigne to their priuate spirit a double effect the one of proposing the obiect the other of working in the subiect
in respect of the obiect it proposeth to them

what they are to belieue and why they are to beleeue it and how they are to know both
in respect of the subiect it workes in them say they a firme and infallible assurance of all the former thinges belieued so that they stand sure and certaine not only of the scripture the sense of it

and of their doctrine and verity of it but also of their spirit that it is of the lord and of their saluation that it is as due to them as it is to vse caluins owne words due to christ and that they can no more loose heauen then can christ

nor be no more damned then can christ
in which they attribute to their priuate spirit all the reason of credibility exteriour and all the operation interiour both in the will and vnderstanding which they haue of the certainty of all their faith and saluation
by all which is apparent that as they made it the sole ground foundation which is in the former part at large proued on which their faith is built so they make it the sole meanes as is here proued and the totall cause materiall formall finall and efficient both exteriourly reuealing proposing and persuading and interiourly working or rather deluding them in the obstinacy rather then certainty of their supposed faith
and this priuate spirit and this effect of it is that which they rest vpon and that which in this second part we intend by the assistance of gods grace to confute and disproue

the private spirits interpretation of holy scriptvre deciding of controuersies iudging of mysteries of fayth co~futed by holy scripture

describing this spirit
sect


the holy ghost in holy writ borh foreseeing and also forshewing to vs the abuse of this priuate spirit the better to forewarne vs of it to arme vs against it doth not only in generall as it doth many other abuses but euen in particuler and as it were on set purpose both plainely decipher and describe it also fully confute and condemne it
out of it therefore we will draw our first arguments of confutation and by it conuince

of falsity this deceitfull and deceauing spirit
and first to begin with the new testament for the more full instruction of our selues and the plainer confutation of this spirit will for one proofe conioine in one argument the testimonies of the chiefest apostles that is of iohn peter and paul

first iohn
epist chap
doth plainely giue admonitions against this spirit

belieue not euery spirit but try the spirits if they be of god
secondly both iohn and paul doe giue the reasons why we should not belieue but try these spirits

iohn
because many false spirits are gone out into the world
paul
tim

because in the last tymes certaine shall depart from the fayth attending to spirits of errour and doctrine of diuells
againe
cor
for that satan himselfe doth transfigure himselfe into an angell of light that is doth make shew of workes of piety iustice and deuotion thereby to allure men by opinio of him to his traps of errours damnation

thirdly both peter paul do shew in what sortes of persons is this spirit what fruits and effects it produceth in them
paul briefly calls the persons

rauening wolues who after his departure will enter among them and men who arising out of themselues will speake peruerse thinges and draw many disciples after themselues
peter more fully describes the effects of it shewing

that it makes false prophets and lying maisters who bring in sectes or as it is in the greeke heresies of perdition

who blaspheme the way of truth

walke in the concupiscence of vncleanesse contemne dominion

allure vnstable soules

promise liberty

speake proud thinges of vanity

entangle those who flye from of the world

and turnes from the holy commandement and knowne way of iustice

and being vnlearned vnstable depraue the scriptures to their perdition
these are the effects of this spirit which that we should not belieue for the foresayd reasons the apostle did giue the foresayd caueat or admonition

in which we may note
first for the former admonition that there are diuers reasons why we are not to belieue euery spirit

because there are so many and diuers

spirits as one

the spirit of god which is of god
another

the spirit of man which is in man
another

the spirit of the world which is of worldly thinges
another

the spirit of the diuell which is euill
one

which is the spirit of truth
another

the spirit of lying and errour
one

the spirit of wisedome and vnderstanding
another

the spirit of giddinesse

because the effects of these spirits are often doubtfull not certaine of what spirit they proceed

because the similitude and manner of their operations motions is many tymes great and hard to be discerned

because the art and meanes how to discerne and iudge of them is very hard not certaine

because the guift of discerning them is extraordinary rare and giuen to few of all which is fully treated in the ensuing chapters therefore great reason there is not to belieue the suggestion of euery spirit great danger there is in following the direction of euery priuate spirit great discretion must be vsed before that any man though learned and holy much more simple and sinnefull can either in wisedome and prudence giue credit or with safety and security rely himselfe his fayth and saluation vpon any priuate spirit or motion of it
reason therfore and experience the doctrine and caueat of iohn that we should not belieue euery spirit

secondly we may note for the tryall of these spirits


how and by what rule this tryall is to be made

who and what sort of persons are to make it and apply the rule
for the rule and meane of trying these spirits catholikes assigne it to be the spirit of gods church or of the chiefe pastours in it gouernours of it as consenting

or at the least not dissenting one with another and as vnited and no way separated by schisme or heresy from their head so that what spirit soeuer is squared by this spirit directed by it and conformable in fayth and manners to it is infallibly the spirit of god
and what spirit of whomesoeuer is contrary to it diuided from it or separated from communion or society of it is certainly not the spirit of god but of man the world or the diuell
and this is a way certaine to try spirits and discerne which is true or false good or bad of god or the

enemy
for sith the spirit of god is as god is one and not diuided

one god one lord one spirit one and the same spirit
in one spirit we are baptized into one and in one spirit made all to drinke and sith the church of god is directed by this one and the same spirit this spirit of truth this

paraclete the holy ghost which shall teach all truth it followes that whosouer are partes of this church and members of this body

you are the body of christ and members of member must haue their spirit vnited with it ordered by it and subordinate to it
and see whatsoeuer spirit is contrary to it or diuided from it cannot be the spirit of god but the spirit of the enemy of god
this is apparent out of authority of holy scripture

the protestants for the most part will haue this rule of triall to be scripture for so is their common tenet that al spirits are to be tryed by the word of god yet some of them of more quick insight finding this to be insufficient because sayth caluin they who say thus

say somewhat but not all for except we haue the spirit of prudence to discerne it will little auaile to haue the scripture on the fingers ends therefore they assigne the consent of church or councel for vnity sake thus saith caluin to be this publicke rule or meanes against those mad men who bragge of the spirit
but being vrged yea caluin vrges it himselfe whether a man shall rest on the councels determination he resolues noe
for sayth he euery spirit of euery priuate belieuer shall iudge of this decree and determination of the councell
if so then as the publicke councell shall try and iudge the spirit of euery priuate man so the spirit of euery priuate man shal againe try iudg the spirit of the councel
and then what end or pause wil be of trying and iudging betweene euery priuate mans spirit the councells spirit and what certainty can be in either this therefore is a round or circle no meanes or rule to try spirits if they be of god as in the eight chapter is more fully declared
and this for the rule of trying spirits

for the persons who by office haue right to try spirits and apply this rule and meanes though the catholikes prohibit none yea perswade all for their owne satisfaction to do it so they do it by the direction of the former rule

according to the modell of it yet the proper office function to do it they assigne only to the pastours and directours in gods church who by the authority of their function and the ability of their learning should in reason be more fit to discerne these spirits and direct the people in the discerning of them and also by this direction establish keep a subordination of inferiours to superiours or of the sheep to the pastour and nourish and maintaine an vnity of of faith and doctrine among both

the protestantes giue this right and office of discerning spirits to all and euery faythfull person to whome they giue liberty euery one to try and iudge their pastour yea all pastours prelates cou~cels and their spirits
whereby as they infringe all ecclesiasticall subordination so they are expresly contrary to paul who doth assigne for one of the guifts of gratiae gratis giuen which is not common to all the guift to discerne spirits thereby also do open gappe to all confusion and dissentio and thus faile not only in the meanes how but also in the persons by whome spirits are to be tryed

out of all which· reason thus

that spirit which we are forewarned not to belieue which is to be tryed by another spirit and that spirit by another in infinitum that spirit into which sathan

transfigureth himselfe deceauing many and making many false prophets and rauenous wolues that spirit which brings in

sects of perdition drawing ma+ny out of the church which causeth so many to

blaspheme the way of truth to walke in concupiscence

to contemne dominion

to allure vnstable soules

to promise liberty to speake proudly

to depraue scriptures

to turne from the commandement

and to draw disciples after it that spirit which cannot be discerned whether it be the spirit of god man or the diuell whether of truth or falshood of wisedome or giddines and in regard it hath so great similitude in effect and operation one with another that spirit say cannot be an infallible rule and iudge to interprete scripture iudge of fayth decide controuersies and direct euery man in the way of his saluation this is euident and needs no proofe

but such is the priuate spirit which euery priuate person

and challenges to himselfe as is before proued and by experience confirmed in that euery heretike ancient or late hath by force of it separated himselfe from gods church broached so many blasphemous opinions contemned so highly all promised licentious liberty of the ghospell depraued so fowly holy scriptures and drawne so many into perdition after them all which shall more at large afterwardes be confirmed therefore it doth follow that this priuate spirit cannot be a rule of fayth able to assure and secure euery one in his beliefe and saluation
and thus much of the first proofe out of scripture against this priuate spirit

out of
pet

making the same spirit authour and interpreter of scripture
sect
ii

the second proofe is out of peter who
pet


prouing the power and present co~ming of christ first by the of some in his transfiguration next by a more firme testimony in respect of the iewes that is

the holy scripture which he commends for the effect which is to lighten as light in a darke place and for the authour which is the holy ghost hath among the rest these wordes vnderstanding this first that no prophecy of scripture is made by priuate interpretation for not by mans will was prophecy brought at any tyme but the holy men of god spake inspired with the holy ghost
in which wordes peter makes first a serious premonition vnderstanding this first as a point of principall and important consideration
secondly he layes downe his assertion in wordes plaine powerful against this priuate spirit that no prophecy of scripture that is no sense and meaning of scripture for so are they called

some prophets because they did expound the secret hidden mysteryes of scripture and foretell the ioyes of heauen to the iust as ambrose

and anselme with all others do expound it is made by priuate interpretation that is according to chrysostome not by the spirit which many bragge of as the spirit of god

but falsly pretending it do speake that which is their owne

according to clement not according to the proper vnderstanding of our owne wit
yea according to caluin not by our owne proper sense for what we produce out of it is prophane

the sense therefore according to the plaine wordes and generall consenting interpretation of all is no priuate spirit of any priuate man expounding scripture according to his owne priuate sense and proper conceit and fancy is a fit meanes to interpret gods holy word of which thirdly he giues this reason because not by mans will or by any selfe seeming humane conceit was prophecy brought at any tyme that is the sacred and holy sense of gods holy word neuer at any tyme brought forth and penned but the holy men of god the prophets and apostles spake and dictated what they wrote inspired with the holy ghost that is because the holy ghost was the author of the wordes and sense of holy scripture in the mouth and handes of those who first penned it therfore must the same holy ghost be the expositour of the sense of it in the mouthes of them who rightly vnderstand it
and this to be the true sense of this place witnesse besides the former testimonies not only the rhemists bellarmine

and others but also caluin himselfe saying the spirit which spake by the prophets is the only interpreter of himselfe

out of which place and wordes inferre first that as the true text of scripture it selfe so also the true sense

and meaning of it is a meane and ground of christian religion first and principally to be knowne
secondly that this true sense is not to be made by any priuate interpretation of the priuate spirit of euery priuate person
thirdly that it is to be made by the same spirit of god which was the first authour and dictatour of it

and out of this inference and euidence of wordes argue thus
that spirit which must be the true and infallible interpreter of holy scripture is and must be the same which was the first author and writer of it as is heere proued but that spirit which first wrote the text of holy scripture was not a guift or spirit communicated to euery priuate person though faythfull but only to the prophets and apostles the first and prime pillars and pastours

of gods church as is euident
therefore this and the same spirit or guift which is giuen to expound the same scripture is not a spirit giuen to euery priuate belieuer but only to the pastours and pillars of gods church who as they are the successors of the former first pillars and apostles so also they receaue the same spirit to interprete the same scripture which their predecessours wrote
as therfore the true spirit resided chiefly in the first pastours pillars of christs church to write holy scripture so also the same spirit resides chiefly in their succeeding pastours and prelates to expound it and not in euery faythfull and simple belieuer who can only read it

out of
cor
prouing the interpretation of of scripture to be a guift gratis giuen not common to all faythfull
sect
iii

the third proofe is taken out of those places of scripture

which attribute this guift of interpreting scripture not gratiae gratificanti or to iustifying grace which is common to all faythfull belieuers and adopted children of god

but gratijs gratis datis or graces freely bestowed which are speciall to some persons only and those not alwayes saints holy men
for which we may note that paul
cor
of the
guifts of the holy ghost which there he recounts and of which foure to wit
curing diseases
working miracles
prophecy of future euents
discerning of spirits are transeunt motions and fiue to wit
wisedome
knowledge
fayth
kindes of tongues
interpretation of languages are according to deuines permanent habits of these say doth paul assigne
both them and their proper function to be about the deciding or explicating of matters of beliefe interpreting of holy scripture that is
wisedome which is to explicate the high mysteries of the trinity incarnation predestination and the like

knowledge which is to explicate either matters of manners

what we are to do and how to liue or mysteries of fayth by examples comparisons and philosophicall reasons

fayth which is eyther without feare to professe and preach what is belieued or by contemplation to penetrate and explicate the deep mysteries of beliefe

and to wit kindes of tongues interpretation of languages which is to explicate obscure and hard places of scripture to interprete hymnes and prophecies in strang languages and to translate the scripture into other tongues
all which in their seuerall function and in diuers manners are imployed in discerning iudging and interpreting of mysteries of fayth difficulties of scripture

secondly we may note that these guifts doe not necessarily depend and follow vpon iustifying grace

and so are not common to all faythfull or true children of god but are speciall guifts graces bestowed some vpon one person some vpon another euery one as the spirit of god pleases
not all vpon euery one
this is apparent first out of the text which sayth that to one certes by the spirit is giuen the word of vvisedome to another the word of knowledge to another fayth to another interpretation of languages to another grace of doing cures of miracles of prophecy of tongues of discerning of spirits
againe are all apostles as heades are all prophets as eyes are all doctours as tongues are all miracles and hauing the grace of doing cures as handes do all speak with tongues doe all interprete the scripture as maisters no surely
for he hath giuen some not all to be apostles some not all to be prophets other some not all to be euangelistes other some not all to be pastours and doctours to the consummation of the saints into the worke of the ministery eph
secondly the same is apparent by the comparison of this mysticall body with a naturall body which also the apostle vseth
for as all members haue not the same operation but some haue one some another the eyes to see the hands to worke the feet to walk the head to discourse so in the mysticall body all and euery one though faythfull haue not the same and all guiftes but some one some another as some haue the guift of cures some of miracles some

of tongues so also some haue the guift of wisedome science and interpretation but all haue not euery one of them therfore some must as maisters teach some as scholers learne some as heades direct and instruct some as members be directed and instructed so that as all members are not one member so neither hath one member all operations or functions but according to diuision of graces is also diuision of ministrations and operations

out of which it doth follow first that the guift of interpretation of holy scripture and explicating of high mysteryes of fayth is a guift not generall and common to all the faythfull as depending and following necessary vpon fayth or grace but speciall and particuler to some as gratis giuen to whome it pleaseth god to giue it
secondly that all faythfull and iust persons cannot be directed by this extraordinary guifte in their iudgement of fayth decision of controuersies and interpretation of scripture because it is not giuen to euery iust man as is proued not yet only to the iust

but sometymes to the vniust as to those who cast out diuells in our sauiours name and yet he knew them not that is

did not approue and commend them
and out of these argue thus

to interprete scripture and decide controuersies of fayth is a guift not giuen generally to all the iust or faithfull by vertue of their iustification but extraordinarily bestowed vpon some only as a grace gratis data but the priuate spirit according to the protestant doctrine is a guift giuen to all and euery faithfull by vertue of their iustification not gratia gratis data to some therefore the protestant priuate spirit cannot be a guift giuen to interprete in euery one the holy scripture and iudge of all controuersies of fayth
the maior is the doctrine of the holy ghost
the minor is the doctrine of the protestants
and so the conclusion following out of both is most certaine

out of ezech
describing in false prophets this priuate spirit with the effects punishment of it
sect
iiii

the fourth proofe is out of the prophet ezechiel who chap
doth describe and decypher to vs
this priuate spirit what it is

the persons in whome it is


the effects which it worketh

the punishment which ensues vpon it
therefore he describes that spirit to be the same with this priuate spirit that is the spirit of their owne hart

which the prophets follow
this spirit is in the the prophets of israell that prophecy

in the the daughters of the people which prophecy
both of them being the people of god

and chosen israelites

the effects of it

are

blindnes they see nothing

vanity they see vaine thinges

lyes they diuine lyes saying our lord sayth whereas haue not spoken
chap
saying peace and there is not peace

fraud which as foxes in the desertes
tyed by the taile of malice and seuered in the heades of doctrine doe destroy the vinyards of christ
cant
as dawbing of a wall made by the dawbers of clay or morture but without temper of chaffe or straw
as cushions and pillowes made by delicious women and layd vnder mens heades to lull them in security and catch their soules
in both which with faire exteriour shew and hopefull promises they deceaue the people feeding some with a security of future good terrifying others with danger of future euill that they might kill the soules that is denounce that they shall be killed who dye not and viuificate the soules that is declare that they shall liue which liue not lying to the people that belieue lyes

the punishment it brings with it is woe to the foolish prophets
woe to them that sow cushions and make pillowes will destroy the wall and accomplish my indignation in it my hand shall be vpon the prophets in the councell of my people shall they not be and in the scripture of the house of israell they shall not be

written neither shall they enter into the land of israell
they shall diuine no more and will deliuer my people out of their hands

loe heere is described the nature the authour the effect and the punishment of this spirit

in all which if we compare spirit with spirit person with person effect with effect and punishment with punishement

we shall find the priuate spirit of the protestants properly described in this false spirit of the false prophets
this false spirit of the false prophets was a spirit of their owne a spirit of their owne hart that is of their owne inuention according to their fancy because as sayth the prophet hieremy

they did falsely prophecy to you in my name and sent them not sayth our lord
the priuate spirit of the protestants is a spirit of euery mans owne and his owne hart euery one hath his owne spirit and that priuate and singular to himselfe
euery one sayth his spirit is of the lord whereas our lord hath not sent either them or their spirit
these false prophets were some men some women all prophetes of israell
daughters of my people
all reputed among the faythfull children of god and yet false prophetes and false prophetesses were they both
the protestants who chalenge this spirit

are all prophets that is interpreters of the word of god they are in their opinion all faithfull elect children of god all endued with this spirit which is giuen to all common to al men women by it euery one of them doth prophecy and interprete scripture
the fruits and effects of this spirit were blindenesse vanity lying and deceit by which they in hypocrisy made faire shew of piety but within wanted temper of good morter of true piety to daw be their wall and with flattery layd soft cushio~s of hopefull promisses vnder the elbowes of euery mans humour to please their fancy and all to catch soules and deceaue gods people
the protestants spirit which vaunts so much of knowledge verity sincerity and piety what is it but a trappe baited with so many faire baites to catch so many soules their church what is it but a wall without temper or morter of the true spirit or word of god to vphould it from falling and erring their doctrine what is it

but cushions and pillowes of faire promises of certainty of truth and saluation deceauing all who belieue it killing or denouncing damnation to them who dye not and viuificating or assuring saluation to them who liue not their preachers or prophetes what are they but as their blind vaine lying and deceitfull spirit by which they are guided that is men most blind in errours of doctrine most vaine in oste~tation of truth most lying in falsely accusing others and most deceitfull in shifts euasions against manifest truth

lastly as the punishment which fell vpon these prophets their blind lying vaine deceitfull spirit was not only a woe and a curse of gods indignation against them a diuision dissolution of the wall among themselues but also a separation of them from the councell of gods people from the house of israel and from entrance into the land of promise so the punishment which fals vpon this spirit them who are deluded by it is no lesse then a dissolution of all vnity in religion a separation from the church of god from the body of christ from the society of saints from the vnity of whose spirit by the singularity of this their priuate spirit as they are separated in this life so by incurring the woe indignation of god against them as well as the former prophets they must needs be diuided from him and his kingdome in the next life
and this is the fruit of this spirit in all prophets and professours of it and the end and punishment of them who are conducted by it

out of which it followes

that as this priuate spirit

was in the old prophets so it is in these new preachers interpreters of the word of god as in them it inuented new and false prophecies and predictions so in these it deuiseth new and false errours in fayth and vaine and deceitfull expositions of scripture

that as in them it was a spirit of blindenesse lyes vanity and deceit by which many were lead into dangerous and damnable errours fell into great and grieuous punishments so in these preachers and interpreters it hath the same effect and brings vpon them the like punishments

that as then before christ

this spirit possessed and seduced both men and women prophets

prophetesses so now euer since christ it hath done the same

as hierome notes of the tymes before him simon magus had his helene nicolaus his troupes of women marcion his minion sent before him to rome montanus his prisca priscilla ptolomeus his flora apelles his philomela arius the emperours sister donatus his rich sucilla elpidus his agape and priscilianus his galla all prophetesses of like spirit with the prophets all hands and helpers to diuulge their heresies
so in these our later dayes euery new maister had his mistris and euery preacher his partner all participant of the same spirit thus had dulcinus his margaret luther his catherine caluin his ideletta buraea beza his candida and euery new doctour as carolostadius oecolampadius bucerus martyr

sanctius and who not euery one his sister and in the spirit of the lord
out of all which conclude argue thus
that spirit cannot be a fit interpreter of scripture nor a sufficient iudge of controuersyes which is a spirit of euery ones owne hart a spirit blind lying vaine and deceitfull a spirit seducing men women a spirit which separates from the society of the faythfull and infers a woe and indignation of god
but such is the priuate spirit which in the old law seduced false prophets and in the new law deludeth the false preachers as holy scripture of the former experience of the later doe both testify therfore this priuate spirit cannot be a sufficient iudge of fayth a fit interpreter of holy scripture

out of iob
declaring in eliu his friends spirit the manner of proceeding of this priuate spirit
sect


a fifth proofe is out of iob
the patience of iob hauing beene tryed in the losse of his cattle his family his children and in the vexation of his body vpbraiding by his wife was after all this assaulted by his friends
these sayth the glosse represent the fashions of heretikes who vnder the shew of aduising vse the arte of seducing for which iob before he began to dispute with them sayd he

would shew them to be fabricatores mendacij

cultores falsorum dogmatum

framers of lies and worshipers of false opinions
of these three of them being conuinced by the speaches of iob and made silent therby the fourth eliu the busite a young man of a more feruent spirit the sonne of ram that is excelsus or proud a new maister riseth vp angry against iob because he sayd he was iust before god
against his friends because they could not answere iob with reason
and beginning first to commend himselfe and his silence because was young was affraid to speake and then to condemne his elders saying that the ouldest are not the wisest neither doe the old wen vnderstand iudgment and lastly to shew of what race he is come and to our purpose he sayes as see the spirit is in man and the inspiration of the omnipotent doth giue vnderstanding
and also will answere my part and will shew my knowledge for am full of wordes and the spirit of my belly streyneth me behould my belly is as new wine without a vent which breaketh new vessels
will speake and take breath a little will open my lippes and will answere
god hath made me as he hath made thee chap

heare yee wise me my words and yee learned harken to me cap



heere is a description of a new spirit

and of one full of it a caluinist or puritan in the highest degree he hath the spirit of god the inspiration of the omnipotent vnderstanding aboue others his belly is full of the spirit and words seeking vent as wine out of a new vessell he will speake talke and answere that which his auncestours and wise men could not he hath reason which they had not he is inspired by the omnipotent which they are not he is inspired that iob is vniust because he sayd he was iust before god
that the ancients are destitute of wisedome and iudgment of the spirit of god of all truth verity that he hath the spirit of truth and that all truth is to be learned of him this spirit in a hoat puritan sayth as sedechias the false prophet who had a lying spirit in his mouth sayd to micheas the true prophet hath the spirit of the lord left me

and hath it spoken to thee no sure for the spirit of god hath forsaken the whole church to which yet it was promised by

christ so that it hath erred is fallen and become antichristian but the spirit is certainly in me it infallibly teaches me truth tels me the meaning of scripture assures me of saluation it cannot depart from me and my mouth the mouth of my seed for euer thus sayth the caluinist out of his spirit as this eliu and sedechias sayd out of theirs

out of which argue thus that spirit which is the same with the spirit of these false prophets who were so seduced and armed by it against the saintes and prophets of god cannot be a fit spirit to interprete scripture iudge of doctrin and to make a sole ground of beliefe but such is the priuate spirit now and alwayes hath beene in all former heretiks and false prophets therefore it cannot be a fit iudge of controuersies and an infallible interpreter of scriptures

out of tit
shewing the spirit of an hereticke
sect


the sixth proofe is taken out of an admonition giuen by paul against heretikes tit
in these wordes a man that is an heretike after the first and second admonition auoid knowing that he that is such an one is subuerted sinneth being condemned by his owne iudgement
in which wordes we are to note
first who is an heretike that is to be auoided


the reason why he is to be auoided
first therfore as heresy is a voluntary errour in the vnderstanding against some verity of fayth obstinatly defended by him who hath once belieued so an heretike is he who hauing once professed the christian fayth doth erre in some article of it doth with obstinacy defend his errour for which is requisite

that he haue receaued the christian fayth at least in baptisme by professing it

that he erre in some point or points of fayth not in al for then he is an apostata

that he be obstinate in his opinion or errour of which sort are not they who according to augustine defend their opinions though false and peruerse with no stubborne stomack

or obstinate hart especially if it be such as themselues by bold presump+tion broached not but receaued it of their deceaued parents

and doe seeke the truth warily and carefully being ready to be reformed if they find it such
these are not to be reputed among obstinate heretikes
but those according to the same augustine who in the church of god haue any crazed and peruerse opinion if being admonished to be of a sound and right opinion they resist obstinatly and will not amend their pestiferous opinions but persist in the defence of them are thereby become heretikes going forth out of the church and are counted for enemies that exercise vs againe he an heretike that when the doctrine of the catholike fayth is made plaine and manifest to him had rather resist it and chose that which himselfe held
according to whome and the doctours of our tyme he is sayd to be obstinate in heresy who willing witting doth maintaine any thing against the catholike church or which is all one who knowes and reflectes that his opinion is contrary to the sentence of the catholike church and yet neglecting the authority of the church which proposeth it for true doth persist in his opinion
and this is an heretike who after admonition being growne thus obstinate is to be auoyded reiected and refuted

secondly the reason why we are to auoyd an heretike is because that such an one sinneth in obstinacy and is subuerted without hope of amendement being condemned by his owne iudgement undefined span alphabet that is sayth tertullian

because he chose that for which he is damned by willfully adherring to his owne opinion and conceit where the origen of his sinne subuersion and condemnation is his prefering his owne conceit

before the determination of the whole church of god which is proper to those who rely vpon their owne spirit and prefer it before all euen the whole church of god
out of which it followes first

that the origen of all heresies is a mans owne proper and priuate conceit which he preferring before the iudgement of the whole church chooseth to follow his owne opinion rather then the determination of the church
and out of this argue thus
all who rely and build vpon their owne priuate spirit iudgement and opinion

for matters of fayth

religion preferring it before the sentence of the whole church and pastours of it are heretikes sinnefull subuerted to be auoided according to paul but such are all those who make their priuate spirit the rule and iudge of their fayth religion and exposition of scripture as is apparent because neglecting the direction of the spirit of god which directs his whole church they preferre before it their own priuate spirit which directs themselues therefore are iustly condemned and so to be auoided as heretikes

out of diuers places of scripture condemning the relying vpon our owne iudgement
sect
vii

the last proofe which will vse is out of these places of scripture which as in generall they exhort vs not to be wise in our owne conceit nor to trust in our owne opinion iudgement so in particuler they do condemne this relying of euery man vpon his priuate spirit which is nothing els but his conceit and opinion
first the wiseman sayth

leane not vpon thy owne prudence be not wise in thy owne conceit

the way of a foole is right in his owne eyes but he that is wise heareth counsaile

there is a way that seemeth to a man iust but the later end thereof leades to
say sayth

vvoe to you that are wise in your owne eyes and prudent before your selues
moyses sayth

you shall not doe there the thinges that we do heere this day euery man that which seemeth good to himselfe
of all which paul giues a reason and denounceth a punishment because

hauing not glorified god they are become vaine in their imaginations and their foolish hart hath beene hardened for saying of themselues that they be wise they are become fooles
and

to them that are of contention obey not the truth wrath and indignation

in the flame of fire giuing reuenge to the that know not god and that obey not the ghospell

out of which places argue thus they who leane on their owne prudence are wise in their owne conceit are vpright in their owne eyes are wise and prudent before themselues doe that which seemes good to themselues say themselues are wise these become

vaine foolish contentious know not god obey not truth resist the ghospell and are cursed according to holy scripture
but such are all they who in mysteries of fayth in matters of religion and in expositions of scripture forsake the direction of the spirit of god promised and giuen to his church and rely and depend vpon their own spirit or self seeming conceit who by it choose their fayth and vpon it ground their saluation as all protestants do who are guided by this priuate spirit therefore in this miserable and desperate case of ignorance vanity folly obstinacy and cursednes are all those who in their fayth religion and exposition of scripture are thus guided directed and instructed by their priuate spirit

and if these sayinges of scripture be verified in affaires morall or domesticall publique or politique which are in the compasse of our naturall iudgement reason of which they are properly vnderstood and in which experience also teaches that they who in any arte science or negotiation most rely vpon their owne iudgement and follow their owne wayes do often commit the greatest errours and fall into the deepest dangers wheras they who are aduised by others and goe the ordinary way doe for the most part proceed more securely and succeed more prosperously then much more is the verity of them confirmed in mysteries of fayth which are aboue our capacity in verities of religion which are not measured by reason and in explication of scripture which is a

booke sealed and that

with seauen seales which none in heauen or earth could open or looke vpon but the lambe

nor any spirit interprete it but that which did make it
in all which euery mans proper iudgement must needes be weake and euery ones priuate spirit doubtfull whether it can attaine to the true and proper vnderstanding of them
all which is confirmed by the authority of that famous doctour augustine who sayth quis mediocriter intelligens

non plané viderit vvho though of meane capacity doth not plainely see that it is more profitable and secure for the simple to obey the wise then to liue according to ones owne direction and if this course be safer in small matters as in tilling of ground marrying of wiues

education of children and ordering of ones family much more it is in religion for humane thinges are more easy to be knowne and in diuine things there is more danger of sinne and offence
and againe no science or trade

though meane and easy is learned without a maister what therefore can be more audacious and temerarious then to seeke to vnderstand bookes of diuine mysteries without interpreters and againe men to vnderstand a poet do seeke for a maister

asper cornutus donatus and others and darest thou without a guide aduenture vpon the diuine bookes which be full of diuine mysteries as all confesse and darest thou giue thy iudgement or interpretation of them and thus is this priuate spirit defining of fayth decyding of controuersies and determining of religion confuted by authority of holy scripture expresly confuting and condemning it and the aforesayd function assigned to it
he who wil see more testimonies to proue the right iudge of controuersies and the infallible interpreter of scripture which are the authority of gods holy church and the chiefe pastours of it let him read bellarmine

where he shall see the practise and testimony of antiquity and the euidence of reason all at large cited for the same

the private spirits interpreting of holy scriptvre and iudging of mysteries and controuersies of fayth confuted by the testimony of holy fathers
chap
iii

we haue confuted this pretended power and authority of the priuate spirit by the authority of gods holy word it remaines that we do the same by the testimony of ancient holy fathers

for which we may note that as augustin alleadging the fathers before him against the pelagians sayd that he would not assume to himselfe to alleadge the sentences of all fathers

nor yet all the sentences of them whome he alleadged but some sayings of some few which yet are such as will cause our aduersaries to blush and yield if eyther feare of god or shame of man will ouercome

so great an obstinacy in them
so we will not vndertake to alleadge either all the fathers or al the testimonies of those· whom we alleadge no more then we haue done al the prophets or apostles or all the authorities of them whome we haue cyted which labour in both we leaue to the who are more expert in both yet hope we haue collected some and those in euery age such as being wel pondered seriously discussed may suffice to satisfy the reader that in their iudgement this priuate spirit is an vnfit interpreter of holy scripture and an vnable iudge to decide matters of fayth

secondly we may note that though none of the ancient fathers did in particuler write of this subiect nor yet on set purpose confute it

yet these sayinges and sentences of theirs sought and picked out as so many dispersed flowers of their seuerall gardens and coupled togeather as into one may serue for a taste of their generall opinions iudgement in this matter especially since their assertions were neuer contradicted nor their persons euer censured by any for them

thirdly we may note that those fathers who doe either attribute this prerogatiue of interpreting scripture to the church or pastours of it as the most cyted by bellarmine before quoted doe or derogate the same from all humane and proper wit and iudgement as some of these heere cyted in their words do do both of them as much as if in expresse tearmes they had done it condemne this priuate spirit and power of it as incompetent for a iudge of fayth
because they who interprete scripture and assigne the fathers councells or church for approued and authorized iudges in this case must needs condemne those who forsake them and oppose themselues and their iudgement against them which all they doe who rely vpon their priuate spirit and prefer their iudgement of it before the iudgement of the church and fathers

because all who are guided by this priuate spirit and rely vpon it doe in effect rely vpon their owne iudgement and opinion and so either erroneously mistaking themselues or abusing the spirit do insteed of the spirit of god make their owne conceit fancy or imagination

the iudge and vmpire of all
these being supposed we will descend to particulers and cyte some of these fathers and their testimonies in seuerall ages

first therefore to the first age of the apostles to descend downe
clement

the scholer of paul and coetaneall with the apostles sayth it is to be obserued that when the law of god is read it ought not to be read or vnderstood according to the meaning of euery mans owne wit for there are many thinges in holy scripture which may be wrested to that meaning which euery one volu~tarily presumes to frame to himselfe but this cannot be
loe the sense which euery ones wit and iudgement which they call their spirit presumes to frame cannot be a true and infallible sense of scripture

in the second age irenaeus a doctour and martyr who hierome calles virum apostolicum an apostolicall man speaking of the heretiks of his tyme sayth euery

one sayth that his owne fiction which he hath deuised of himselfe is wisedome that he vndoubtedly vnspottedly and sincerely doth know the hidde mysteries
these heretikes made the inuention of their own braine the vndoubted spirit of wisedome to vnderstand the hidden mysteries of fayth
tertullian speaking of heretikes who differ among themselues sayth euery

one doth tune what he receaues according to his owne liking in the same manner as he who taught them made it according to his owne liking
againe shewing that diuersity of doctrine brings corruption of scripture he sayth they

who are resolued to teach otherwise then the church must change the meanes of doctrine that is scripture since how came the heretikes to be strangers and enemies to the apostles but by the diuersity of doctrine which euery one according to his owne liking either made or receaued againe vvho

are rauenous

wolues but subtill senses and spirits that lye close to molest the flocke of christ vvho are false prophets but false preachers vvho are false apostles but adulterous ghospellers againe

he is to be counted an heretike who forsaking that which was first doth choose to himselfe that which was not before
againe heresy is called in greek of election by which one chooseth to beginne or follow it therefore paul sayd that therefore an heretike was damned because he chose to himselfe that for which he is damned
it is not lawfull for vs to introduce any thing vpon our owne opinio nor to follow that which others introduced vpon their owne opinion
and

he calles adams sin an heresy because he chose it rather vpon his owne then gods election
heere are deceitful spirits euery ones owne spirit liking will purpose resolution opinion and election described to be that which makes men heretikes and strangers from god rauenous wolues false prophets and adulterous ghospellers and damned heretikes and changes the sense of scripture
out of which the same tertullian

affirmes that heresy is a matter of humanae temerity not diuine authority which alwayes so amends the ghospell vntill it corrupt it
that all doctrine is true not which came from a priuate spirit but which agrees with the apostolicall mother and originall churches and that is without doubt to be held which the church receaued from the apostles the apostles from christ christ from god all other doctrine is preiudicated as that which sauoureth against the verity of the church of christ
againe that

to deale with heretikes by scriptures is but to turne ones stomacke or breake his braine to loose his speach by contending to rayse choler by hearing their blasphemy since what the most expert scripturist can alleadge they will deny and what he denies they will defend eyther by denying scripture or by adding or detracting

from it
valentinus sayth he

receaued that which was most for his purpose and formed the scriptures to his owne opinions but not his opinions to scripture
and so as augustine saies they

contend not for the true meaning of scripture but for their owne opinions making that which is the opinion of their owne to be the meaning of scripture

in the third age clemens alexand in his learned bookes stromatum which he wrote according to baron anno
shewing not only that heretikes alleadge scripture but also how they vse it sayth though

they who follow heresies presume to vse the propheticall scriptures yet they neither vse all of them nor these they vse entirely but choosing those sayings which are doubtfull they draw them to their owne priuate opinions

this is one of the chiefest sleightes of this their priuate spirit to wrest doubtfull sentences to their owne aduantage make that which is vncertaine in it selfe certaine and a point of fayth

in the same age cyprian that doctor suauissimus martyr beatissimus as

august
calles him speaking of some whome the diuell leades from one blindnes of the world to another darkenesse of errour sayth they

call themselues christians and while they walke in darknes they thinke they are in light the diuell flattering and deceauing them who transfigures himselfe into an angell of light and subornes his owne ministers as ministers of iustice affirming night to be day damnation to be saluation and shadowing desperation vnder pretence of hope perfidiousnes vnder pretence of faith antichrist vnder the name of christ
againe shewing how heresies and schismes arise out of disobedience of the people to one pastour and iudge in place of christ he sayth no

man should make any stirre against

the colledge of priests no man after diuine iudgement after the suffrage of the people after the consent of should make himselfe iudge not now of the bishop but of god
no man should deuide the vnity of christs church by discord being proud should by himselfe coyne and set abroad a new heresy
againe

the beginning and endeauour of heretikes and schismatikes is to please themselues and to contemne their superiour with swelling pride they goe out of the church and set vp a new altar breake peace and vnity
againe in

doctrine as well diuine as philosophicall it is neyther safe nor fit that persons vnlearned and ignorant of that which belonges to those sciences should venture to discusse that they know not and to be maisters of what they are ignorant
in all which the effect of the priuate spirit is described to be to question examine that which is determined by bishops and councels to make it selfe iudge of all to diuide the vnity of the church to broach new heresies and in conceit and respect of it selfe to contemne all superiority to teach that they know not and to be maisters of what they vnderstand not

in the fourth age ambrose a man so worthy that augustine

reuerenced him as his father who begot him in christ so praysed him that he not only calles him happy the flower of latin writers but all the roman world sayth he with me admire him his grace constancy labours perils both in workes and wordes yea sayth he pelagius the heretike so extolled him that he durst not reprehend him his exposition of scripture but acknowledged that in his bookes aboue others did shine the bright+nesse of the roman fayth
this holy saint and doctour sayth those

are heretikes who by the wordes of the law impugne the law for they set a proper sense vpon the wordes that they may commend the wickednesse of their owne opinion by the authority of the law
againe it

is a very dangerous thing if after so many prophesies of the prophets after the testimonies of the apostles after the bloud of martyrs thou darest presume to discusse the ancient faith

as new after so many guides dost remaine in errour and after the toiles of so many departed this life darest contend in idle disputation let vs reuerence therefore our owne fayth in the glory of martyrs
heere is this priuate spirit and two effects of it the one to interprete scripture according to euery mans owne liking the other to examine and question againe that which hath beene iudged by the pastours of gods church and to censure them and their iudgement both condemned by ambrose

hierome one whome prosper calles vitae

exemplum mundi magistrum
an example of life and the maister of the world whome augustine

calles one most learned skillfull in three tongues desires to conferre with him to adhere to him and to be instructed by him sent his books to be censured of him and commended others as orosius

who trauelled for that end from spaine to palestine to learn of him
and whome damasus

the pope and many from all the partes of the world consulted with about obscure places of scripture
this great lampe of gods church sayth heretikes

whatsoeuer they speake they thinke it to be the word or the law neither doe they vouchsafe to know what the apostles or prophets thought but doe apply certaine incongruous testimonies to their owne sense and meaning as though it were not a great most wicked manner of teaching to depraue the sentences of scripture and to draw them contrary to their sense vnto their owne will
a deuise proper to this spirit to thinke all it sayes to be scripture and to wrest all scripture to its owne liking
againe he sayth that

heretikes of the guifts of nature haue made to themselues idols not which they receaued of god but which they

made out of their owne braine
that

they haue turned the holy speaches and senses of scripture into idols which they haue framed out of their owne heart
that

hauing lost their iudgement they worship the idols which they haue framed of their owne hart and are possessed with the spirit of spirituall fornication
that

of the sense of scripture they haue made idols of diuers opinions and abominations of offences
that

they vse the diuine wordes and testimonies to their owne sense and do giue them to drinke to those whome they deceaue and with whome they haue fornicated
that

in all questions they follow not the authority of scripture but the opinion of human reason
that

they snatch certaine sentences out of scripture and sowing them togeather doe set them to that matter to which they cannot agree and so do set them as pillowes vnder euery ones elbow to delude them
thus

doe sayth he all heresies deceaue and draw to death by faire promises all sortes of ages and sexes giuing them not solid bread of scripture but broken and cut peeces of crummes
thus

did the manichees gnostikes marcion take testimonyes out of the pure fountaine of scripture but did not interpret them as they were written but co~uerted the simple mea+ning of gods word to signify that which themselues would haue
all

this they did bragging of their receauing the spirit of god which yet they had not but the spirit of the diuell by which they were carryed

into diuers factions
such an angell and diabolicall spirit did possesse and fill philomela apelles his virgin
co~cerning which spirit he concludes that it

is called heresy ab undefined span alphabet of election by choosing euery one that doctrine which seemes to him better vnderstanding the scripture otherwise then the holy ghost meant it by which he is an heretike
the su~me of which gathered out of these dispersed places is that all heretikes being deceaued by the spirit by their owne opinion and their owne selfe seeming conceit do choose to themselues what sense of scripture seemes most pleasing to them and therby make it an idoll of their owne inuention

by which they deceaue themselues and delude others
eusebius

confirmes the same saying of the seuerians that they interpret the sense of scripture according to their owne liking

in the fifth age augustine one so highly commended both by ancient fathers and late protestants that as before is at full cyted they both count him as a maister of all learning as a fountaine incorrupted a doctour among the interpreters of scripture as a sunne among planets as the greatest of the fathers the worthiest deuine that euer gods church had
this great doctour and saint sayth heresies

haue no other origen then this that euery heretike prefers his owne opinion drawne from his owne proper spirit before the commo opinion of the church
againe nothing

makes them heretiks but this that misvnderstanding the scriptures they obstinatly defend their owne opinions
the

holy scripture is dangerous to these who will wrest it to their owne peruerse hart who whe they ought to liue according to the will of god they liue according to their owne will and they will haue that to be the meaning of scripture which is their owne when that which is the scriptures ought to be theirs

againe

thy truth lord is neyther myne nor this mans· or that mans but all mens whom thou callest publickly to the communio of it and whereby thou dost terribly admonish vs that we seeke not to haue truth priuate least we be depriued of it for whosoeuer doth challenge to himselfe that which thou dost propose to be enioyed by all and will make that proper to himselfe which is common to all that man is driuen from the common to his owne proper that is from truth to falsehood
wherupo he reprehends

the pelagians because they vnderstood the scripturs according to their own priuate sense the donatists because

eyther by too much louing their owne opinion or enuying their betters they went so farre vpon their diabolicall presumption as sacrilegiously to separate holy communion and bring in schisme or heresy and the manichies you

see that your worke is to take away all authority from scripture and make euery mans mind and conceit authour of what is to be belieued or not to be belieued in holy scripture that is that you will not subiect your selues to scripture but will make scripture subiect to your selues
thus doth augustine condemne this spirit for that it doth prefer it selfe and owne opinion before the commo iudgement of the church doth falsely interprete scripture doth draw the meaning of scripture to its owne wil yea the will of god to the same
and he condemnes the pelagians donatists and manichies for that by it they expounded scripture and deuided themselues from the communion of holy church

with augustine agrees cyrill of alexandria

heretikes should do well if they would seeke the true sense of scripture and not turne all according to their owne will
and with them both vincentius lyrinensis if

any would seems a prophet or maister that is maister of spirituall thinges let him chiefly desire vnity

and equality that is that he do not prefer his owne opinion before others nor doe departe from the generall opinions of all men
because

all doe not take the holy scripture in one and the same sense some do interprete one way others another way the same sentences so that as many senses are made as there be men
therefore it is very necessary by reason of many turninges and windinges of errours that the line of catholicall and apostolicall interpretation be directed according to the rule of the ecclesiasticall and catholike sense
heere is aduise giuen not to wrest all to our owne liking and spirit but to keep vnity and direct the interpretation of scripture according to the rule of catholike sense

after all these venerable

beda

the honour of our nation in the eight age sayth as the prophets did write deliuer and speake not their owne wordes but the wordes of god so also the reader of them must not vse his owne proper interpretation least he decline from the sense of the truth
therfore we affirme that no man presume to expound scriptures according to his owne pleasure
what more plaine

will adde to these the testimonyes of luther and caluin vttered in confutation of others but against themselues
luther

speaking against swenkfeldius sayth it must not trouble vs that some do glorify of the spirit and little esteeme the scriptures
but sayth luther good friend the spirit goes this way that way also was in spirit and haue seene spirits if may glory of my owne perhaps more then they shall see in a yeare and my spirit doth shew it selfe in something where theirs is yet in a corner
note that the swenkfeldians and the caluinists agree in that

both of them rely on the spirit and make it the ground of their fayth they differ in that the former refuse scripture and rely only on the spirit these later admit scripture but both for canon and sense of it subiect it to their spirit so that the spirit in the one reiects scripture in the other it censures and lordes it ouer scripture
whether is worse let any be iudge
caluin also speaking of the same swenkfeldians

sayth if that spirit was good it would be the same with the spirit of the apostles and ancient faythfull people but their spirit would not be iudg without scripture so say we if caluins or the caluinist spirit were true it would be the same with the spirit of the ancient church and fathers
also against the vbiquitarians he sayth satan

hath bewitched their mindes with horrible witchery
and satan by turbulent spirits doth endeauour mans

hart hath so many secret places of vanity is subiect to so many holes of lyes is couered with so much fraudulent hypocrisie that it often deceaues it selfe
againe many

false doctours belye or counterfeite the title of the spirit many mad men start vp who rashely make ostentation that they are endued with the spirit of god
they

are fooles who amazed at the honourable title of the spirit dare not enquire after the matter it selfe
many

braggo of the spirit yet speake in their owne priuate name goe out in their owne name vtter out of their owne sense
thus do these patrons practisers of this priuate spirit wound themselues in thus stabbing the same in their aduersaries
for what they affirme against them is verified against themselues

but what can these spiritualists as we may call them say to all these testimonies of fathers or rather what shall we say to them about the same conceaue nothing can be sayd better then that which augustine in the like case of originall sinne sayth against the like heretikes the pelagians for hauing cyted most of the doctours before his tyme both of the greeke and latin church as irenaeus athanasius cyrill nazianzen chrysostome basil olympius reticius

fourteene more whose workes are not now extant as eulogius ioannes ammonianus porphyrius fidus zozimus zoboenus nimphidius cromatius iouinus eleutherius clematius all greeke doctours and cyprian hilary ambrose innocentius yea hierome of his owne tyme all doctours of the latin church and all to proue originall sinne and necessity of grace against iulian the pelagian he speaketh of the fathers in this manner these

fathers haue cyted no more least it should be too tedious to read them yet such as are not so light that you may scorne to weigh the yea so great that you may groane vnder the burthen of them
these

are they whose so great consent ought to moue you and who are not a conspiracy as you call them of ill tongued men but who flourished in the catholike church are sound in doctrine and armed with spirituall weapons who fought stoutly against heretickes and haue passed ouer their labours and slept in the bosome of peace vvho

hauing liued holily and ouercome the errours of their tyme and departed gloriously out of this world before you came into it
these

though they were not then present when this controuersie began and is now on foot so could not by word of mouth giue a definitiue sentence yet when they wrote and sayd these thinges they were then such as had not any either friendship or falling out with you or vs
they were angry neither at you nor

vs had compassion of neither
what they found in the church they kept what they learned they teached what they receaued from their fathers they deliuered to their children
you and we did not plead before these iudges and yet they decyded our cause neither you nor we were knowne to them and yet we do produce their verdict for vs against you we did not about this matter contend with you and yet they pronounce vs victors
that

which they belieue we belieue what they teach we teach what they preach we preach yield to them and yield to vs consent with them and consent with vs if you will not by them be a friend to vs yet be not for vs an enemy to them which yet you must be if you remaine in this errour therfore leaue it and leane to them
can

pelagius and celestius luther and caluin so farre preuaile with you that for them you dare forsake so many and so great ancient doctours and defenders of the catholike fayth ouer all the world hath tyme made such a confusion of great and small matters is darkenes so become light and light darkenes that pelagius celestius iulianus do see and hilary gregory nazianzen ambrose are blind vvere

it not better to yield to them who are better and stronger and to maister your owne presumption then to insist vpon your owne animosity and conceit which you desire should preuaile because it is your owne vvere

it not better to

yield to these christian doctours or rather to christ in them and to restore your selfe to them from whome you are departed how

gratefull would these be to you if you did belieue the catholike fayth and how terrible must they needes be against you when you oppugne the same catholike fayth which they sucked from the teat which they eate with their meate which for milke and meate they gaue to little ones and great ones which they plainely and stoutly defended against their enemies euen you not then borne by such planters waterers builders pastours nurses the holy church increased therefore stood amazed at the prophane termes of your nouelty and as the head of a serpent abhorred troad vnder foot bruised and kickt away your new opinions which did lurke and crawle to deceaue the virginity of the catholike church and corrupt the chastity of it which it hath in christ as did the serpent seduce eue
the fayth of these is to be defended against you as is the ghospell against wicked and professed enemies of christ euen that catholike and christian fayth which as it was first deliuered in scriptures so by these fathers it hath beene hitherto kept and defended and shall by gods grace euer be kept and defended
thus

augustine against the pelagians their new doctrine for the fathers and thus we against the protestantes and their priuate spirit and new doctrine for the same
and this may suffice for the testimonies of fathers

the private spirits interpretation of holy scriptvre deciding of controuersies and iudging of matters of fayth confuted by reasons drawne from the difficulty of discerning of spirits
chap
iiii
of the diuersity of spirits
sect


in the former chapters we haue confuted the protesta~t priuate spirit by authorityes of holy scripture and by testimonies of ancient fathers it remaines that we doe the like by euidence of reason and in this chapter by reasons drawne fro the difficulty of discerning of spirits of which if the priuate spirit be not able to discerne and iudge which be good or bad which true or false much lesse is it able to discerne iudge

the motions and effects of them that is which scripture the sense of it is true or false which fayth and doctrine is good or bad

for the better vnderstanding of which difficulty of discerning of spirits we may note first how many sortes of varieties and distinctions of spirits there be

according to the nature and property of spirits gregory distinguishes them thus

some are without mixture of body some with mixture

spirits without mixture are either increate as god the father a spirit god the sonne a spirit god the holy ghost a spirit all one god al one spirit good without quality great without quantity euery where without place alwayes without tyme doing all without action mouing al without motion containing all and contained in nothing and present in all by his essence power and presence and yet aboue all or els create which are either happy in glory as the angells in heauen which are as

administring spirits for vs or els damned in hell as the diuels who as

roaring lyons seeke to deuoure vs both which doe differ either in specie or kind or at the least in degrees of power and greatnes some being in the highest some in the midle some in the lowest hierarchy euery hierarchy hauing his order and euery order his particuler angels and diuels belonging to it
spirits mixt with bodies flesh are either such as are mixed with flesh and dye with it as the sensuall soule of birds and beastes or such as are mixt with flesh but dye not with it as the reasonable soule of man which is a meane betweene angells to whome he is inferiour and beastes to whome he is superiour communicating with the one in the immortality of soule with the other in mortality of flesh

according to their estate

and condition these spirits are some good as god angels saints others bad as diuels men wicked aliue or damned in hell others indiffere~t as the natural spirit of man and sensuall of beastes some are blessed in heauen as angells and saints others damned in hell as diuels and the damned soules others in the way and out of danger as the soules in purgatory or in the way and in danger as the soules of men liuing some are meere

intellectuall as god and angells others more sensuall as beasts others rationable mixed of both as man some alwayes without bodyes as angels and diuels

others alwayes with bodyes as beastes and birdes others sometymes with body and sometymes without as the soule of man liuing or dead before and after resurrection

according to the effect and operation

bernard distinguishes six kindes of spirits

diuine of god

the spirit is god

angelicall of angels

he hath made spirits his angells which alwayes worke good

diabolical of the diuell

he sent immissions by euill angells

carnall of the flesh

puffed vp by the sense of the flesh

worldly of the world

you haue not receaued the spirit of this world which worke alwayes bad

humane of man

the spirit of man which is in man which of all is indifferent and when it is assisted with grace is good when stayned with sinne is bad

to which may be added the spirit of truth and of lying the spirit of wisedome and giddines and the spirit of the knowledge of truth and errour of which is spoken before cap

of which spirits for our purpose these chiefly are to be noted that is the spirit of god of angells of diuells and the spirit of the soule of man dead in heauen in hell or in purgatory and of man liuing according to the dictamen either of our naturall reason or of the light of diuine fayth and grace
and thus much of the variety and differences of the nature of spirits which are to be discerned

secondly we may note that these seuerall sortes of spirits haue seuerall sortes of operations in man and do seuerall wayes manifest and shew themselues in him and to him for as in the naturall life of man besides the powers vegitatiue and sensitiue by which he liues and moues god and nature hath prouided certaine more subtile spirits that is the vitall spirits in the hart which passing through the arteries do help to vitall operation as nutrition and augmentation and sensible spirits in the braine which passing through the veines do assist to the sense of feeling touching and the rest so also in the spirituall life of a christian man besides the permanent guifts of the holy ghost and habits of faith

hope

and charity infused in baptisme and pennance togeather with grace god doth communicate also certaine extraordinary helpes and guifts to the soule which as certaine beames of his diuine light and sparkles of his celestiall loue assist and enable it to a higher knowledge of god and good thinges and to a more perfect practise of vertue and perfection and these are diuine illuminations inspirations or visitations and visions which are of two sortes the one meere spirituall and internall the other sensible and externall

the first sort of spirituall motions arise immediatly from foure heads

from god who illuminating the vnderstanding with a heauenly light clearely to discerne what is true or false what good or bad inflaming the will with an ardent desire to loue sincerely him and his goodnes and to doe his holy will and commandement and enabling the rest of the faculties with an inuincible fortitude to performe couragiously what is to his greater honour glory doth when or how he pleases and by meanes and in tyme best fitting as prayer meditation reading or such spirituall practises speake instruct and direct the soule by speciall illustrations inspirations and confortations

from the good angell who by good cogitations and motions exciting the dulnesse and drowsinesse conforting the infirmity and weaknes of the soule and conseruing the same from danger of enemies is alwayes ready to assist vs in prayers and good workes and to defend vs from all occasions and temptations

fro the spirit of grace which with the light of fayth flame of charity inhabiting in vs doth continually knock at the dore of our heart and in our sleep awakes vs in our sicknesse strengthens vs in our distraction so recollects vs that with alacrity we may proceed in all exercises of piety and with facility ouercome all assaults of our enemy

fro the dictamen of reason and light of nature which pricked forward by the synderesis of a good conscience doth as a preacher continually exhort and moue to a prosecution of good and an auersion from euill and as a maister doth still direct and instruct vs how to behaue our selues in our combat against the law of sinne and the angell of sathan

which make continuall opposition against it all which as a vigilant watchman doe still watch at the superiour part of the soule to wit the memory will and vnderstanding eyther by an infused light or by species formed and framed in the phantasie and do inwardly knocke awake admonish and incite our soule to the knowledge of truth the operation of god

the other sort of spirits is sensible and visible

by visions and apparitions and these are sometymes imaginary presenting inwardly to the phantasie and imagination

a shew and apparition either of wordes spoken or of persons appearing in their own person or in some other like to the or in some figure representing them others sometymes are visible and corporall seene heard or felt in some corporall body formed and framed of the ayre and assumed moued by a spirit which in them speakes walkes and exercises sensible actions as though it were a true and liuing person both which kindes happened often to the patriarches and prophets of old and to many in these later tymes sometims waking sometymes in their sleep

and are both of them either by way of oracles as augustine calles them when some graue person appeares and fortells what is to be done

as did onias and hieremy to iudas or by way of visions

when thinges haue the euent indeed as they appeare in shew as happened to peter who

saw an angell whe indeed the angell did free him out of prison or by way of dreames

when apparitions of mysteries are shadowed in figures not vnderstood in sense and signification such as was pharao his eares of corne and his statua

all which whether interiour or exteriour though they be properly diuine of god and good angels of which is frequent mention and examples both in the old and new testament yet because they are sometymes diabolicall of the diuell who by suggestions and illusions doth imitate them and sometymes naturall dispositions or diseases of body whose affections and imaginations are not much vnlike to them and because of the later sortes that is visions and apparitions of which is the greatest difficultie examples

in scripture and ancient histories for will forbeare latter tymes are many and authenticall how sometymes god sometymes angells sometymes diuells sometymes soules out of limbo paradise purgatory hell heauen haue appeared therefore will first produce some examples of euery one

and then shew what difficulty there is in discerning one of them fro another

for apparitions of god we haue examples how he appeared to

adam in paradise to

noe in the arke to

abraham in haram in ma~bre in the mountaine to

moyses in the fiery bush in aegipt in the mountaine and in the tabernacle and to

agar in the desert to

samuel in the temple and to all the prophets and many of the patriarches in all which it is sayd our lord spake our lord appeared which he did in the shape now of a man as to adam now of three men to abraha now of a wrestlar to iacob now of a fire to moyses now of a cherubim to

ezechiel now of

a thorne to isaias now of

an old man in a white vestement to daniel though it be more probable that not god in person but an angel representing god did appeare

for apparitions of angells we haue exa~ples expresly of them how they appeared to

lot to forewarne him of the destruction of sodome to

iacob to encourage him against esau to the

israelites to direct them through the desert to

gedeon to make him captaine against madian to

tobie to accompany him in his iourney to

elias to send him to reprehend ochozias to

dauid punishing and killing the people to

zachary and to the virgin mary reuealing secret mysteries to the
which apparitions if we respect the place were made either in the garden as to our

sauiour or in the fieldes as to

iacob or in the desert as to

agar or in the house as to

gedeon or in the fornace as to the three

childre or in the temple as to

zachary or in prison as to

peter

or at the sepulcher as to mary magdalene
if the state of persons they were made to our sauiour himselfe to christians as peter to iewes as ioseph and the patriarches to gentils as heliodorus and the three kinges to men as zachary to women as the maries to old persons as abraham

and sara to young as daniel to good persons as lot

and bad as the sodomites
also some before christ some after christ some in christs tyme some in the law of nature some of grace so that in all tymes and at all places

to all sorts of persons these reuelations of angells haue bin made

thirdly for apparitions of diuells wherof some are sayd to be pythonici or some paredrij or familiars some catabolici or possessors and tormentors of men

some oniropompi or dreame makers we read of their visible apparitions to omit their imaginary how they haue appeared often and in many shapes sometymes of beastes as of a serpent to

euah and leonard of

corbie of a dogge following them to

simon magus and cornelius agrippa of a horse to an earle of

mascon of a cocke to

pachomius of a crow to

romualdus of a foxe to

hilarion of a dragon to

margaret and to gonzales of castile of lions buls beares and wolues to

anthony of a dog to

dunstan ordinarily of a cat to witches and of wolues

to terrify of bees and flyes to trouble distract

men
sometimes of men or women and to

apelles like a beautifull woman as to our sauiour christ like a venerable ma

in his tentation to saul in some opinion as

samuel by the pythonise to

martin as a king with a diademe to a boy in gregory as a blacke

more to robert the abbot as a frisled

ruffin to maximus as a mariner with a ship to euagrius as a cleargy man to macarius as a reaper of corne and an apothecary to nathanael as a carrier whiping his

horse
in all which he alwayes appeared in some deformity as either in a body blacke pale durty stinking or terrible or with a face foule blacke and deformed or with a nose hooked a mouth wide eyes hollow or fiery feet club or clouen toes like clawes or some great deformity of body as is

obserued god not otherwise permitting it the better to discouer

him sometymes in the night to men eyther waking as to

luther when he taught him to abrogate the masse or sleeping as to

zuinglius in what colour he knew not when he taught him to expound the wordes of the sacrament figuratiuely and to

oecolampadius when he kild him in his bed sometymes in the day as to

carolostadius when in the pulpit he stood by him sometymes he appeared in shape of saints angels and christ and god himselfe

of which see examples afterwardes sometymes of incubi and succubi lying with men or women and by art getting of children sometyms of centaur's scylla's chimera's gorgons cerberus harpyes and other monsters terrifying me sometymes seeking adoration to be worshipped as gods which they require of witches sometimes shewing a seruiceable obedience as when to magicia~s they eyther at certaine wordes of magicke or at certaine constellations of starres or vpon certaine dayes of the weeke as friday at night they ryse vp appeare and disclose thinges secret as treasures or foretell thinges to come as the euents of batels or the like
all which in what shape they please to who god permits the diuells performe

fourthly for apparitions of soules out of limbo before christ we haue the examples of moyses from limbo and elias from paradise to our sauiour and the three apostles

in the transfiguration of onias the high priest and hieremy

the prophet to iudas machabeus and the people of samuel the prophet

according to

augustine and others to saul the king telling him sayth ecclesiasticus the end of his life and exalting his voice out of the earth in prophesy or as it is in the greeke after he had slept or was dead prophesying

fifthly for apparitions of soules out of purgatory we haue ancient exampls of paschasius a deacon seene by germanus· capuanus in the bath of angulanus of iustus freed by
masses of his brother copiosus of another helping a priest at the bathes and helped out of purgatory by his masses al three cyted by gregory

the great and of the sisters of

malachias and

thomas of aquine both appearing relating themselues freed by their brothers masses
with

many other of later tymes too long to be set downe

sixthly for apparitions of the damned in hell to omit the apparitions of infidels such as are related of romulus to

proclus exhorting the roma~s to worship the gods of homer to appion the

gra~marian telling him his owne country and friends of achilles to apolonius of seuerus to

heliogabalus of castor pollux

in the latine warre of the ghost at athens related by pliny to be leane faced long haired and handes and feet

chained to omit say these infidels we haue of christians the examples of theodoret

the arrian king carryed betweene iohn the pope and symachus the senatour both whome he had killed into vulcans forge of chilpericus

the wicked king of france seen by guntran the king carried between three bishops into a hoat caldron of a bishop of

ancona seen by elias an hermit standing before gods tribunal and caryed to hell of a nunne

in laurence church cut in peeces before the altar of eubronius an apostata appearing to one whome he had vsed cruelly and carryed into
and so many more too pittifull to be remembred

seauenthly for the apparitions of the soules in heauen we haue the examples first of our sauiour to paul in his way to damascus

to peter flying from rome and saying he went to rome to be crucifyed againe

to carpus bishop of crete

with multitudes of angells reprehending him for too seuerly punishing a lapsed brother to peter bishop of alexandria complayning that arrius had torne his coate

to martin in the halfe coate which the day before he had giuen for his sake to one naked next of our blessed lady recount only those which are ancient to

iames in spaine at saragossa for erecting there a chapell now in great veneration to

gregory thaumaturgus in a glorious shape to

musa a virgin in gregory his dialogues for the amendement of her life to

iohn damascen restoring his hand cut off for defending images to

cyrill admonishing him to be friends with chrysostome to

narses in all his battailes against totila to

cyriacus an abbot for the burning of nestorius writings to the

architect of constantine the great building a

church to the sonne of a

iew cast into an heat ouen by his father for receauing the blessed sacrament among christians to pope liberius and

patricius about building maria ad niues to

rupertus an abbot giuing him a quicke wit and vnderstanding of scripture
all which are of our lady
of other saints we haue the apparitions of

peter and paul to constantine and curing his leprosie of

philip iohn euangelist to gregory thaumaturgus shewing a worke of piety to be done of the

apostles at constantinople in tha~ks of iustinian building them a church of

iames to charles the great helping him to recouer galicia from the sarazens and to rainerus and alphonsus kinges of spaine against the moores also of

saint agnes to constantine the great his daughter geruasius

and protasius to ambrose potamiena

origens scholler to the torturer foreshewing his martyrdome

felix nolanus defe~ding his citty nola

thoodore martyr admonishing euxouius to auoid meates sacrificed to idols

cosmas damian curing iustinian sore sicke

peter and paul terrifying attila from sacking of rome to omit what is related in this kind by basill of mamant by nazianzen of his brother caesarius by hierome of paula by paulinus of ambrose by euodius of steuen by prudentius of fructuosus and his company by lucianus of gamaliel by palladius of colluthus by theodoret of iohn baptist by athanasius of ammon
and who desires to see more may read in delrio the like apparitions in euery age of christ how some appeared as our sauiour and valeria in the first
how potamiena and others in the second
how our blessed lady iohn cyprian and diuers african martyrs in the third
how our sauiour our lady peter paul agnes agatha spiridion artemius caesarius triphillus two bishops and others in the fourth age
how iohn baptist martin geruase and protase ambrose eulalia fructuosus felix in the fifth age
how our lady iohn peter and paul bartholomaeus steuen eutichius tetricus iohn silentiarius in the sixth age
how our lady iuuenall eleutherius leocadia in the seauenth age and so downeward in all ages vntill this present

tyme or neere
all which being not only ancient for the tyme as being within the first
years but also made credible by the sanctity of them who did appeare by the grant of them to whome they did appeare and by the authority of them who belieued and related that they did thus appeare may in prudence and piety be credited and cannot without leuity and temerity be condemned or reiected
and thus much of the variety of spirits and the certainty of their apparitions
it remaynes that we shew the difficulty in discerning these spirits and the apparitions of them and by the same conuince the insufficiency inhability of priuate spirit to discerne good spirits from bad reuelations fro illusions and true fayth doctrine from false erroneous

of the difficulty to discerne these spirits
sect
ii

the first difficulty of discerning thes spirits ariseth vpo the difficulties which are in particular about these seuerall sortes of spirits the apparitions visible made by them

and first of the spirit of god great difficulty hath anciently beene made whether god did appeare in his owne proper body or in one assumed that is whether he had such a body

or such partes of a body as appeared in shew and are by scripture attributed to him that is whether he had head eyes hands feet and the rest of the partes of a body or not also as yet great difficulty is made supposing as it is most certaine that he is a meere spirit whether god himselfe did appeare in assumed bodies or some angell in his place representing his person if himselfe should haue appeared whether the father the sonne or the holy ghost and if the holy ghost whether he assumed that flesh of a doue or of tongues for example in which he appeared in the like manner as the second person assumed the nature of man and of this doue thus assumed whether it may be adored and prayed vnto as god and the holy ghost which assumes it

of the spirits of angels

great difficulties are made of

their nature whether it be corporall or meere spirituall if spiritual whether all be of the same or of diuers species or kinds whether all be incorruptible by nature or by grace whether made before or with the world how they can know god and things on earth how they know things to come or contingent and how they can vnderstand one another how by what vertue they moue themselues and other things how they are distinguished in orders and hierarchies how they haue and performe the custody of men
concerning their assumed bodies it is doubtfull difficult whether they informe them or assist only in them how and of what matter they doe make and frame them how and what operation or motion they exercise in them whether any vitall or externall operations as of eating or drinking or any sensual or external as of hearing or seeing or any internall as of passion or affection or any intellectual as of discoursing and discussing of sinning and meriting how they illuminate one another the higher the lower how they present visions and cogitations to men whether to their phantasie only by the phantasie to the soule or imediately to the superiour part of the soule also

of the diuels great difficulties be made how they fell fro grace by what sinne of pride or enuy into what place of hell only or the aire earth also in what number more then the blessed or fewer how they are tormented with materiall fire and how they carry their torme~ts with them while they torment others and yet the fire torments not those others in whome they are how they enter possesse and torment men in what number by whole legions in what manner with such instruments of tortures how they frame and assume bodies whether of dead men of beastes and the like or made of the ayre how they can abuse women and beget children how they cause thunders lightenings stormes how they tempt men oppose the angels hate god and all good how they are deuided into orders hierarchies how a subordination and confusion stands among them with many such like

of the soules departed are many difficulties as whether

in person samuel himselfe or a diuell for him appeared before saul whether moyses from limbo and elias from paradise before christ whether their apparitions be internall only to the phantasie and imagination or externall corporally to the senses also if internal whether the soules can or angels for them do produce these phantasies if externall whether their apparitions be personal in their own presence or representable by angells for them if personall in their owne presence whether the soules in purgatory o~ly or those in heauen and hell also do in presence personally appeare if all of them whether present in their own bodies in which they liued or in others by them assumed if in assumed and made bodies whether made by themselues or by angels for them if in bodyes made by angells whether they can informe and giue life or els inhabite giue only motion to them if only motion what quantity they can moue greater then their owne body was or lesse to what distance further off or neerer by what vertue naturall or superadded they can moue them what operation they can exercise in them whether naturall of working mouing or vitall also of eating and sleeping or sensual also of delectation or auersion and which is most intellectuall of reasoning speaking if they vse reason whether they know what is done on earth how they know it by reuelation from god or by relation from angells or by species or formes of their owne retayned of old or acquired anew whether they vnderstand where they are and what they doe whether they in purgatory can by prayer and satisfaction be freed whether they who are in heauen or hell can increase their ioyes or paines with many more such like

of all which if one should aske any ones priuate spirit or the diuers spirits of diuers ones and seeke for a certaine resolution of them what answere would their spirit affoard or what agreement would be among them or their answers or what certainty can be builded vpon any of them surely such is the difficulty in all these and many more doubts that let any one spirit of one man or many spirits of

many men resolue them the hearer shall find such opposition in their resolution and so great difficulty in discerning which of these is a good spirit which a bad which vision is imaginary which corporall which effect is of god which of the diuell which is to be belieued and followed which to be forsaken and abhorred that he shall find himselfe more doubtfull then before and deeper plunged in difficultyes the further he proceeds in inquiries
and thus much of the first reason of difficulty to discerne the difference of spirits

of the difficulty and vncertainty of the rules of discerning spirits
sect
iii

the second difficulty of discerning these spirits ariseth vpon the variety and multiplicity of the rules meanes which on the one side men holy learned experienced after much practise of deuotion great labour of study long experience of tyme either by illumination fro god or by diligence industry or by subtility of obseruation haue made obserued and in large treatises left to posterity for the discerning of these spirits

and which on the other side are so vncertaine and doubtfull that what by the infirmity of man to discerne them what by subtilty of the euill spirit to deceaue in them few can with any certainty and infallibility rely

and depend vpon them

first therefore for my owne and the readers instruction will set downe the rules out of diuers and large treatises collected which vsually are giuen for discerning these spirits

and next shew the grounds and reasons of the vncertainty and fallibility of them and out of both inferre the insufficiency and inability of euery mans priuate spirit to make an infallible estimate and iudgment of them and therby to rely

for himselfe and his estate of saluation vpon this his spirit and the opinion of it

svbdiv
rules to discerne which are good spirits and which are bad

and first for the meanes signes

or rules of discerning these spirits good or bad though there be no great difficulty or vncertainty in discerning spirits which are euill as the spirit of the diuell and his instruments the flesh and the world for that the good spirit of god of an angell or of grace cannot suggest those wicked cogitations nor performe those vnlawfull actions which the bad spirits both can and do as for example they can neither lye deceaue blaspheme nor persuade heresy infidelity periury and sacrilege nor commit vncleanesse and lewdnesse by way of incubi or succubi nor obey inchaunters magicians witches for wicked vses nor worke and leaue in good soules doubts troubles and despaire of god saluation neither vse they to appeare in horrible and deformed shapes of beasts and monsters all which and such like are proper to the bad spirit sufficient rules signes to discerne him by these fruits and effects
yet because the bad spirit the diuell both can and doth often counterfeit and in shew performe the same exteriour actions which the good spirit doth as by examples shall afterward be shewed therefore will propose only the rules and signes which are giuen for the discerning of the good spirits of which is the most difficulty and vncertainty and of their motions illuminations and inspirations

first therfore for the discerning of the good spirits

vnder which title include all sortes of motions which come imediatly either from god or from angels or from grace the difference of which doth not much import since they are all good and of god mediatly or immediatly the rules and signes to discerne them are taken some from the obiect

matter which is proposed some from the manner circu~stances how it is proposed some from the fruits and effects which it worketh

the rules and markes drawne from the obiect matter

are
first that the good spirit inspires moues only to verity

and true faith not to falsity and heresy nor to any thing which is contrary to the grounds rules of true faith
and so whasoeuer is contrary to faith and the grounds of it as scripture tradition church councels consent of fathers is not from the good but the bad spirit

secondly that it moues only to matter of piety

and sanctity and to nothing contrary to good life and manners or to the law of god or naturall reason
therefore what is sinne impiety by commission or omission against reason or grace is from the bad not the good spirit
whereuppon it follws that as the prophet saith the spirit of god is corne and fire

a hammer because it nourisheth strengthneth with verity vertue as food it enlightneth enflameth with illuminations and infla~mations as fire and beateth mollifieth with contrition mortification as a hammer but the spirit of sathan is as a dreame and chaffe because it followes things apparent not true things vaine and not solide things that tend to ill not to good
wherfore when it proposes things either true or good it is neither to be belieued in the one nor followed in the other because in the end and application it doth deceaue and brings danger in both

thirdly that it moues sometimes to these verities and vertues as to know loue and follow god in generall only leauing the application and particulers to the direction of others for the matter the manner the tyme the place or the like as it did paul to be a christian leauing him to ananias to be instructed what he should belieue and do
and iephta to make a vow according to the prophet isay who yet by his owne spirit

as faith ambrose choosing the particuler erred and did amisse

fourthly that when it moues in particuler to extraordinary works as for example of pennance fasting as it did antony

simeon stelites katherine of siena to fast many weekes and monthes or of obedience as it did abraham to offer in sacrifice his sonne and others to walke on the water set vpon lyons or the like or of martyrdome as it

did some virgins and martyrs to cast themselues into the water or fire to preuent tentation or confound the tyrants al which it did for the fuller triall of the persons the greater honour of god or more edification of others when say god moues or inspires to these extraordinary workes then ordinarily he doth it with that sense of certainty that he leaues no doubt of it in the soule with that vehemency of motion that the soule presently proceeds to execution with that subtility of attention that in the operation the soule can hardly attend to any thing els but that which is good and of god

the rules and markes drawne from the manner of proceeding of the spirit are
first

that when the spirit doth worke any good motion immediately in the superiour part of the soule as in the vnderstanding reuelations and illuminations of truth in the wil inspirations and inflammations and ardent desires of good in the memory attention and adhesion to god in the same manner as it doth the habits of faith hope charity and the rest all without any mediatio or ministery of any species in the outward senses or of phantasies in the interiour imaginatio to which the power of the bad spirit is limited that then it is the spirit of god which somtimes enters in knocking at the dore of the soule by holy vocations and admonitions to call it from sinne to grace fro vice to vertue somtimes hauing got entrance doth worke labour in the soule either inlightening the darkenesse or inflaming the coldnesse or moistening the drynesse or righting the crookednesse or mollifying the hardenesse or awaking the drowsinesse or curing the sicknesse reuiuing the senslesnes which it finds in the same
somtims it proceeds so far as now to infuse a copious light of knowledge reuealing secret senses of scripture deep mysteries of faith high points of contemplation now to instill a pleasant dew of consolations and comforts in spituall practise and of content and sweetnes in enduring afflictions now to perfume it with a fragrant odour either of the incense of deuotion or of the myrrhe of mortification or of the sweet sent of all heroicall vertues and perfections

wherewith the soule is rapt as it were out of the sense of bodily feeling vp to a glimpse to a taste to a sweetnes to an vnion with god so farre that it is no more where it liues but where it loues now wholy absorpt rauished and inflamed and transformed into god and god into it
all which are a signe of the spirit of god

secondly that the spirit of god thus setled in the soule doth as it were with two eyes looke out abroad into all things
that is with the one of pure intention which seeks not our owne honour profit pleasure and content in any thing but god and his honour glory and praise in all our words actions visitations consolations or desolations the other of discretion

which proceeds in measure not going further in any practise then our ability will extend in weight valewing things of necessity before things voluntary of iustice before charity of obligation before supererogation in degree first mouing then walking then running and lastly flying and that by step to step from the botome to the top imbracing first the feet next the knees then the hands so to the face and presence of our sauiour in order contenting our selues with wayes ordinary plaine facill vsuall and commodious to our selues others not aspiring to works effects extraordinary high prodigious miraculous beyond reach of our reason and without benefit to any
and in all it perseuers proceeds with vigilancy and diligence without stop interruption or retiring in the course of vertue and perfection

the rules and signes drawne from the effects and operations of this spirit

are that the spirit of god for the most part hath and doth cause such a spirituall sauour and taste in the soule where it is that as a man is knowne by his voice and visage as hony is discerned by the taste sweetnes so the motions illustrations and the voice and speach of god are discerned and knowne by a certaine proper diuine and spirituall taste and sweetnes which men accustomed to them and practised in them can by a supernaturall instinct of grace as a child doth his mother by a naturall instinct of nature better discerne in the~selues

then expresse to others and fullier satisfy and content themselues with them then giue any reason of them saying with the prophet

dauid that they taste and see that our lord is sweet with the apostle that they

abou~d in knowledge and all vnderstanding approuing the better things yet they know not with the euangelist

whence it cometh or whither it goeth why it is caused or how long it remaines but only they tast and feele it and so rest satisfied in it

thirdly that the spirit of god doth worke in the heart a true and solid humility

whose acts and effects are
to feare refuse or at the least vnwillingly accept these extraordinary visitations being offered preferring the ignominy of mount caluary before the glory of mount thabor

to conceale and hide not relate and speake of these gifts being receaued but discouering them only in confession for counsell and that lesse willingly then sinnes

to desire to be conte~ned in matters not only honorable of the world but spiritual as to be reputed wicked by persons not wicked but good so long as no scandall is thereby likely to ensue

to wonder that so worthy guifts should be in so vnworthy a person that god should bestow so much good vpon one so bad

to feele rather a shame and confusion for the deformity of sinne then a ioy conte~t in the dignity of the gift

not to desire these great and extraordinary visitations but more ordinary acts of loue purity and humility

not to esteeme of ones selfe better for them but to account others more holy without them

not to presume vpon any security or fauour for hauing them but rather to feare greater obligation vnworthinesse and ingratitude for not well vsing them

fourthly that the spirit of god doth worke a perfect obedience

first of the will against selfe loue secondly of the vnderstanding against selfe conceit both of them first to the will of god to runne the way of his commandements secondly to the will of man that is superiour vnder god to be ruled by him
thus did the holy hermites accept it as a signe of gods spirit in simeon stelites when being commanded to come to them and giue an account of his austere

life he presently obeyed and prepared to descend from his rocke to them

fifthly that the spirit of god doth worke vpon this resignation

a true mortification
first exteriour of the body to tame the pride of the flesh
next and chiefly interiour of the mind to asswage the rage of passion and affection both for that end to attaine to purity not only of mind but also of body

because visions and apparitions much more motions and inspirations though they come saith one in the likenesse of saints of our lady or of christ are alwayes suspitious if they bring impurity of sensuall motions

sixthly that the good spirit of god doth bring with it peace

and tranquillity ioy and gladnesse comfort and consolation of the mind expelling feare bridling passions supressing affections and subiecting all manner of perturbations to reason and grace
and though it cause some terrour desolation or perturbation yet it is at the first entrance when it begins and that in sinners in whom it finds resistance whom yet in the end it leaues in comfort and consolation
and though it be short and for the most not of long continuance yet it is not only frequent often coming and often going and alwayes leauing a good relish after it but also effectual in euery one according to his state as in an incipient in the purgatiue way rooting out vices in a proficient in the illuminatiue way planting of vertues in a perfect man in the perfect way exercising perfection of action and contemplation
and these and such like be the rules and signes they giue to discerne good spirits

svbdiv

difference betweene good and bad spirits

the same holy men the better to distinguish these spirits giue also certaine distinctiue signes by which comparing the effects of the good and bad spirits togeather the difference betweene them may the better be discerned
and first for exteriour visions apparitions

shapes or shewes

of good and bad spirits they assigne differe~ce
first in forme

that good spirits appeare alwayes in the shape of man and that comely and beautifull the bad spirit in the shape often of beasts and monsters and these vgly and deformed

in matter

that the good spirit persuads alwayes to verity vertue but the bad spirit alwayes to falshood and wickednes eyther in the beginning or end

in workes

that the good do help and assist vs in doubts or infirmityes the bad do reuenge and punish our defects or iniquities

in place

that the good appeare in places holy in which piety is practised the bad in places prophane where wickednes is co~mitted

in tyme

that good appeare ordinarily in the light as angels of light but the bad in darkenesse as angels of darknesse

for persons

that the good appeare to good men to encourage them in goodnesse the bad to bad men to draw them to more badnesse

for holy thinges

that good do affect and desire but the bad do fly abhorre thinges holy and consecrated

as the presence of the blessed sacrament of reliques agnus deies the signe of the crosse the name of iesus the inuocation of saints with many other of which examples are copious and certaine in diuers good authours

secondly for the internall motions of the good and bad spirit they assigne these kindes of differences

that the good spirit obserues an order and conueniency of age and state in persons of tymes and seasons in affaires communicating wisedome grace and guifts agreable

to the state of persons religious or secular

to the dispositions of yeares for those which are young or old


to the conueniences of tymes ioyful or sorrowfull reducing by degrees and meanes in order and season all sortes of persons from great sinne to great perfection
the bad spirit obserues no such order but confusedly and vpon the sodaine seemes to eleuate to high thoughts wonderous actions which are nether ordinary nor profitable for the prese~t makes shew to exalt on the suddaine from the deepest of sin to the highest step of perfection thereby to exalt them to pride and and to feed them with nouelty and curiosity

that the good spirit desires nothing in particuler for it selfe and owne profit or delight nothing with importunity and impatience but all with resignation to the will of god so farre as it may be to his honour and glory the bad spirit desires much for its owne will pleasure all with importune and vnseasonable vehemency and perturbatio

that the good spirit moues to inward humility contempt of ones selfe and the more it increaseth in vertue the meaner conceit it workes of ones selfe and the better of others the bad spirit moues to outward humility in exteriour thinges that it may seeme humble and lowly but workes an inward conceit of ones selfe and willfullnesse in all actions and proceedinges

that the good spirit causes one to confide much in god and distrust much in ones selfe the bad spirit causes one to esteeme highly of his owne conceit to presume much vpon ones owne force and litle to feare his owne state danger
that the good spirit is willing to suffer much for gods cause and the more it suffers the more it is contented the bad spirit murmurs and repines and is impatient at al crosses and afflictions and is disquieted and vexed against those by whome they are any way caused or procured

that the good spirit is mercifull and compassionate shewing pitty and mercy

where it may shew iustice seuerity the bad spirit is seuere fierce cruel and reuengefull euen vpon those who do subiect and humble themselues

that the good spirit shews a respect and reuerence euen to the saints seruants of god for the honour it bears to god and also to their reliques and images for the respect it beares to them the bad neglects both and refuses to giue any respect or honour to either

that the good proposes the yoke of christ as easy the grace of god as sufficient and superaboundant to keep his commandements thereby to enable men to performa~ce thereof the bad proposes the performance of gods commandements as impossible and gods mercy as facill before sinne is committed thereby to allure to sinne his iustice

as rigide and terrible after sinne be committed thereby to draw into desperation

that the good spirit if it worke any miracles illuminate with any reuelations or reueale any secrets of the hart

or euents to come doth do all peaceably without any extraordinary motions of sobbing sighing exulting or grieuing without ostentation of any such guift or grace moderatly without any vehemency of desire of them or conceit of ones selfe or contempt of others for them compassionatly without aggrauating of offences receaued or benefits exhibited and humbly with submission to the iudgment of superiour authority and with conformity to their censure and correction
the bad doth all contrary it proceedes in perturbation without peace in vehemency without discretion in exagerations without measure in obstinacy without relenting in any thing from that which it once conceaues

that the good spirit vses those wayes and spirituall meanes which god hath for that present age tyme

and place accommodated as most fit for the spirituall good of soules then liuing
therefore as in former ages he prescribed the instinct of naturall reason in the law of nature the vse of ceremonies in the law of moyses and either strange guift of miracles and languages or ardent desires of martyrdome or rigide austerity of pennance in the primitiue ages of the law of grace so now in these ages not communicating so frequently the guift of miracles nor affoarding so vsually the benefit of martytdome nor exacting so seuerely the former austerity of penna~ce it moueth vs to a more zealous performance of these deuotions which in this tyme the diuell more violently oppugnes to wit frequentation of sacraments vse of meditation duties of obedience veneration of saints visitation of reliques and holy places and the like
the bad spirit peruerts all this order it affects nouelty it seekes curiosity it followes after rarities it ayms at singularity it lookes for prodigiosities and contents it selfe with nothing but straines to extrauagancy it seemes to know all striues to do all seekes to go beyond all and

flyes in his owne conceit aboue all both measure reason discretion

that the good spirit keepes in all a tranquility of the mind

with a conformity in all thinges to the will of god whether it be the rooting out of vices the planting of vertues the exercise of mortification and deuotion all conioyned with a pure iniention of not seeking ones owne but gods honour and with a discreet moderation in being neither too credulous in belieuing all nor too obdurate in belieuing nothing but with aduice and temper to examin all and not rashly to receaue or reiect any
the bad spirit runs in all the contrary race in some thinges it is troubled and disquieted with feares and scruples in others loose dissolute without care or conscience at sometymes feruent and headlong in deuotion beyond measure at others stupide and dull without sense or feeling in some practises of small importance violent vehement and impatient without reason in others of moment negligent carelesse and heedlesse without any esteeme or regard in purposes of good wauering and inconstant in iudgment of others credulous and temerarious
all which omitting much which might be sayd more may suffice to discerne the multiplicity of signes of good spirits and the difference of them from bad
it remaynes to shew that neither these rules to discerne good spirits from bad nor the difference betweene good spirits and bad are so certaine nor the applying them to euery particuler euent so easy that the spirit of euery priuate man can of it selfe proceed in it and securely rest himselfe vpon it

svbdiv

the difficulty to iudge of these rules and differences of spirits

notwithstanding therefore that these rules signes of a good spirit and these differences from a bad be by spirituall men well and truly thus assigned and notwithsta~ding that it be true that they serue for good and morall directions to discerne those spirits and that any man may

proceed probably in his iudgment vpon them yet that they neither are in themselues so certaine and infallible nor yet are for so certaine assigned that euery man may infallibly rely and rest vpon them without any further directour but that these both may and often do faile in many particuler euents and that many are deceaued in the vse and application of them is by these reasons heere briefly and by examples afterwardes more at large produced euidently proued

first because such is the excellency both in nature and operation of these spirits especially angells

and diuels aboue the nature and capacity of man and such is the weaknes and obscurity of mans vnderstanding in these sensuall organs of our corporall frailty and such is the inconstancy and vncertainty of euery priuate spirit in euery particuler person that admit these rules and differences were certaine yet neither is the vnderstanding of euery man so intelligent that he knowes them nor his spirit so that it can discerne them nor his art and cunning so skillfull that he can alwayes vpon euery occasion duly and infallibly apply them but that necessarily vpon ignorance errour or partiality and affection in many cases he may and must needes faile in them
for as all sciences law and phisicke

mathematicke and musicke logicke and rhetoricke with the like and all arts and trades of nauigation negotiation military or manufactory the rest haue their principles documents and these some of them demonstratiue and certaine which yet few or none can out of their owne wit industry without both a maister to teach tyme to learne apply and vse certainly in the practise of particulers so in this science of discerning of spirits which yet is so much more difficult then the former by how much the spirits are more subtil the operations more like the rules more vncertayne and the danger of erring more great a simple and vnlearned man may yea often many most learned and intelligent doctours witnesse for example origen tertullian and all learned heretikes ancient and moderne haue been grosly deluded and dangerously deceaued while insteed of the spirit of god of truth and of light they haue followed

the spirit of sathan errour and darkenesse and by it haue beene conducted not only themselues but also millions by their examples into the pit of perdition and damnation

for as the apostles being troubled with the storme of the sea when they saw our sauiour walking vpon the water

did thinke he was a ghost so there be some who either vpon perturbation pusillanimity scrupulosity tentation or malice do imagine euery motion of god in themselues and euery vision

reuelation or extraordinary worke or miracle in others to be either mere fancies imaginatio~s of man or else ghosts and illusions of sathan
others there be who on the contrary vpon too much leuity credulity of disposition or vpon too much weaknesse and infirmity of the braine or vpon too much pride and presumption of the~selues

do conceaue euery idle imagination of their owne spirit and euery false suggestion of the spirit of sathan to be a vision inspiration or illumination of christ in which being perswaded that euill is good and good euill that darknesse is light

and light darknesse that bitter is sweet sweet bitter they do sometimes belieue and adore a ghost insteed of christ other while neglect contemne christ as a ghost somtimes do belieue and preach errours and falshood as though they were truth otherwhile condemne truth and diuine verity as though it were idolatry and superstition somtimes do imbrace vices sinnes as vertues otherwhile censure workes of zeale charity and humility as acts of passion basenesse and hypocrisy somtimes do giue credit to their fancies and imaginations of their owne or sathans spirit as if they were the spirit of god otherwhile reiect the inspirations illuminations vocations of god as illusions of sathan
and thus while they walke in two extremes both a like perilous that is to neglect christ as a ghost and to follow a ghost as christ to refuse that which is of god as if it were of the diuel to follow that which is of the diuel as if it were of god they belieue falshood and condemne truth they imbrace painted shadowed vices and contemne solid and true vertue

and so follow away which seemes to them iust but the later end thereof leads to death

and are themselues those wicked vvho are so secure as though they had the workes of iust men
and this is the first reason

drawne from the infirmity of man why these rules cannot be to vs certaine and infallible

the second reason is because such is the craft

and subtilty of sathan the wicked spirit that as he can transfigure and shew himselfe in the glory of an angell so can he transforme his actions into the actions of an angell and do the same which the angels do
therfore whatsoeuer exteriour actions either of charity humility or piety deuotion mortification or other vertue a good man by the inspiration of god doth a bad man by the instigation of sathan can doe the like
in which though a difference will appeare in the intention and the end both which in the good are good and in the bad are bad yet in the exteriour action the diuell can so cunningly carry himselfe and so craftily couer his intention that a quicke eye shall hardly of a long tyme discerne him
in this manner hath he carryed himselfe in all or most hereticks ancient and moderne couering himselfe vnder the veile of the honour of god zeale of soules verity of doctrine sanctity of life word of god and the like of all which in many of them he made a faire shew and thereby deceaued many
wherfore paul foretels

that many should come in later tymes who shall giue eare to spirits of errours and doctrines of diuells
and chrysostome did affirme

that all heresyes and all opinions of heretikes are from the diuell
and polycarpe did call

marcion the of the diuell
thus doth

ioannes cassianus auouch that himselfe was an hearing the diuel confesse that he was the authour of the heresy of arius and eumonius
thus doth

clemens romanus

iustinus martyr liuing in their tyme witnesse of simon magus that by the diuell and magicke he was counted a god and had his statua to simon the great god and that menander his scholler deceaued many of antioch by magicke
thus

irenaeus auerres of marcus anaxilaus and others that by a familiar diuell they did wonders and tell things to come· epiphanius

of carpocrates and the gnostickes that they did by familiar diuels and inchantments allure to lust dominiere

ouer the people and make shew of wonders
the like doth

theodoret of basilides and massilianus and eusebius of theodotus and montanus cyrillus of buda innocentius of marcion hierome of priscilianus in spaine seuerus of one anatolius who made himselfe first elias then christ and by counterfeit miracles deceaued rufus a bishop in the same countrey
caesareus affirmes of the albigenses that by the diuell they walked on the water to confirme their doctrine till a priest extraordinarily moued cast the blessed sacrament into the water at which they suncke and the sacrament was by an angell preserued
malmesbury and baronius witnesse that fuldo bishop of chartres saw the diuell stand by berengarius and as it were with his hand calling many to come to him
thus did the emperour maximilia the first witnesse bredenbach see the diuell in a bodily shape sit on the shoulder of luther at auspurge anno
and therby foretould what troubles should arise after his death
thus doth luther confesse of himselfe that he had his doctrine of abrogating the masse of the diuell
zuinglius that he had his figuratiue doctrine from the spirit blacke or white he knew not
caluin that his veyne of rayling was not ingenij but genij not of his nature but his spirit which cannot be a good spirit because it is a spirit of rayling therefore a bad
luther affirmes of

carolostadius of

oecolampadius of

bucer of

marcus cauikanus of

the anabaptists alberus of

osiander lindan of

campanus that they had commerce and directions from the diuell
king iames often did affirme of knocks witnes

barkclay that he was a magitia
and this of the anabaptistes by many experiences is consta~tly related that to read and remember the scripture they are taught by the diuel by whome they are thought to be willingly without torments so possessed that he speake and continue in them till they returne to the catholike fayth
by all which examples and many more most lame~table is proued not only the craft and subtilty of sathan which is more fully shewed in the next section but also which is by them heere intended the vncertainty fallibility of the former rules and meanes to discerne these spirits

since sathan can so cunningly transforme himselfe into an angell and his suggestions into gods seeming inspirations that it is hard to discerne viam colubri super petram

the third difficulty of discerning these spirits

ariseth from the subtilty the malice and the power of the diuell for as the diuell is in subtilty of knowledge a serpent which was more subtile then all the beastes of the earth in venime of malice a dragon out of whose mouth

frogges of venime· and poison did proceed and in power that great behemoth

whose taile being as trees of cedar and his bones as barres of brasse doth deuour riuers and swallow iordan in at his mouth so whatsoeuer the deepest vnderstanding that euer discoursed can inuent whatsoeuer the extremest malice that euer was conceaued can exagerate and whatsoeuer the greatest power that euer was preualent in any creature can execute all ioyned with the longest experience that tyme can affoard the same is couched togeather in this our mortall and potent enemy the diuell who as iob sayth of him

compasseth the earth and as peter sayth seeketh whome he may deuoure like a lyon

all which is imployed to deceaue vs poore and miserable men against whome in enuy to god whose image we carry he layes his trapps

and sets his snares to catch our soules and carry them into the pit of perdition

svbdiv

sathans subtilty by inward suggestions

this subtile malicious and powerful serpent

dragon and behemoth the diuell doth by three wayes of subtilty counterfeit the spirit of god and good angells by which he makes the discerning of these spirits doubtfull

and difficult
the first is by a secret and lurking manner of temptation

for the most shrowded vnder the habit of some kind of piety or deuotion in which with a subtile progresse he proceeds by a certaine gradation from publicke apparent temptation to a secret fraud and illusion by which searching the veines and feeling the pulse of euery mans disposition and by his exteriour wordes or gestures sauouring the state of his soule whether he be in sinne or not and in what sinne carnal or spiritual the dispositio of his mind to what he is inclined to heauinesse or myrth idlenesse or voluptuousnes ambition or couetousnesse the inclination of his passions affections in what they are most veheme~t to passion or affection to loue or hatred reuenge or lust the infirmity of his mynd in what part he is most weake in his vnderstanding or will his irascible or concupiscible or sensible part and the oportunity or occasions of sinne in which he is most easily catched
he craftily obserues when he is idle and vacant from some good imployment in what he is watchlesse and carelesse in the custody of his senses or phantasies to what he is inclined or affected in his delectations or auersions and there he sets the snares of his subtilty and layes the engines of his powers towardes that part where he findes him most weakly sensed most negligently guarded or most apt to bite at his bait

first therefore he plainely publicke known sinnes as murther adultery blasphemy and the like if they suffer the repulse he closely suggests secret and interiour sinnes as enuy hatred contempt obstinacy or such like if these take no hould he watches oportunities and occasions of familiarity and company to sinnes sensuall and delectable and vses meanes and instruments to auarice and ambition and if none of these will draw men to bite he baites a fresh with the memory of sinnes past or possibility of sinnes to come

if none of these catch he fishes for lesser sinnes and smaller imperfections he labours to worke a conceit of an impossibility of perfection a neglect of vertue an omission of smaller dutyes

which if they faile he rests and forbeares to tempt and so lulles the soule into a sleep of

security that there by he may at vnawares catch it in a trick of treachery

that while it least apprehends the danger of sinne he may more easily catch it in a trape of sinne with which tricke if he do not catch it into his trappe he baites a fresh with a new deuice of subtilty he comes as a new man in a shape disguised in a new manner of fashion

he shapes himselfe a painted coate of vertue and perfection and comes out now disguised in a coate of piety deuotion that therby he may allure to impiety and superstition now veiled vnder the maske of humility and meeknesse the better to couer his pride and tyranny now cloathed with a cloake of equity and iustice the easier to exercise his reuenge and cruelty now painted with faire colours of zeale charity and beautifyed with the fairenesse of the word of god and truth thereby the more cunningly to conceale his deformity of malice and heresy and to intrude his owne word of falsity and impiety
and by this art he makes slacknesse in ones charge seeme mildnes prodigality in ones estate shew as liberality auarice appeare as frugality obstinacy to be accounted constancy basenesse to stand for humility slouth for quietnes rashnesse for fortitude perturbation of mind for solicitude of others good
and thus as he cloathes vices with the robes of vertues so he disrobes vertue staines it with the infamy of vice as mortification with a note of dissimulation piety of hypocrisy charity of impiety zeale of reuenge obedience of seruitude deuotion of superstition adoration of idolatry christ of antichrist
whe none of these shewes and shapes of vertue will preuaile

he will not sticke to persuade good thinges and pious actions but then it is either to the lesse to withdraw from the greater good as by too much rigour of exteriour to forget the interiour mortification by too exact performance of ceremoniall obseruations to omit interiour perfection by too excessiue care and solicitude for the zeale of others good to forget or neglect the obligation of their owne good
or if he persuade to any greater good then it is either with too great vehemency feruour to consume ones ability without discretion or with too much obstinacy and pertinacity

to adhere to ones owne opinion against obedience or with too vehement perturbation and disquietnesse of mind to distemper the peace tranquility of reason or with too timerous scrupulosity of imaginatio of sinne to the disquiet of conscience
by which and such like he intends to make men vnconstant in good purposes slow in heroicall resolutions fearefull in pious executions he makes them dull in deuotion carelesse in amendement precipitate in proceeding and obdurate in custome of sinne and wickednes
in all which the wolfe in sheeps cloathing the serpent with a womans face and the lyon with a lambes skin that is the diuell in the shew of an angell

deceaues many and makes as gregory sayth vices seeme vertues and vertues vices makes men looke for a reward when they deserue a punishme~t makes of high cedars of perfection vnprofitable bra~ches of hel fire

svbdiv

examples of sathans inward suggestions

by this subtilty he persuaded the iewes vnder pretence of sanctifying the sabaoth to condemne our sauiour for curing diseases on the sabaoth

he preuailed with iudas vnder colour of relieuing the poore to censure mary magdalene anointing our sauiour for wast
he deluded nicolaus vnder colour of community of all thinges to make also wiues common

he wrought with origen vnder shew of perfection of continency to geld himselfe and in pretext of piety and mercy to grant a generall saluation of diuells and all damned

he drew the montanists and after them tertullian vnder pretext of more mortification of fastes continency from second mariages to forsake the church condemne it of liberty and loosenesse
he preuailed with nouatianus in shew of greater detestation of sinne to deny remission of sinnes after relapse
with the apostolickes in imitation of the apostles themselues to allow no mariage at all and to oblige all to make all thinges common
with the messalians or eutichs in estimation of prayer to pray alwaies and make that alone sufficient to saluation
with the pacificatours for the good of peace to tolerate the orthodoxe

and the eutichian doctrine togeather
thus he persuaded the donatists in desire of martyrdome to kill themselues
the flagellantes in esteeme of disciplining themselues to prize discipline as baptisme
of later tymes he induced the anabaptists as aspiring to extraordinary holynesse to haue women goods and all in common and makes in them shew of reuelations visions
and as yet he persuades many for feare of dishonouring god not to pray to saints for feare of idolatry not to worship reliques in estimation of scripture to refuse all traditions and in shew of attributing more to christ to take from a man all merit and satisction from saints all intercession from angells all custody

from the church all superiority
thus vnder the winges of piety hath the diuell hatched many heresies and vnder the veile of perfection shrouded his most wicked abomination of all falshood and impiety
we read also in particuler how he perswaded one hierome a monke in cassians tyme

vpo presumptio of gods deliuery for his merits to cast himselfe into a well
and another in imitation of abraham

to attempt the killing of his sonne which he had done if the child had not run away
we read also of ancient tymes how in a solemne festiuity of the gentils made at caesarea philippi he caused a certaine pagan victime cast into a fountaine first to vanish out of sight and then carryed it vp into the ayre till by the prayers of asterins

the same remayned and did swimme on the water
also in later tymes he so farre preuailed in one guido an heretike that in his life and at his death he was esteemed a saint after his death being discouered for an hereticke and his body to be burned the diuell defended it from the fire and eleuated it into the ayre to astonishment of all till being subdued by holy thinges he cryed out we haue defended thee guido so long as we could now we must leaue thee

svbdiv

sathans subtilty by imaginary illusions

the second way of his subtilty is by an inward kind of

suggestion which appearing in the shew of diuine reuelation doth lead many into the pit of eternall perdition making them belieue they are inspired by god when indeed they are deluded by sathan

whose suggestion in their apprehension runs current for gods reuelation
of which we haue examples both ancient moderne most frequent

how he deluded cerinthus with many reuelations as from certaine of the apostles

witnesse caius and dionysius alexandrinus

marcus an of that tyme with many prophesies witnes irenaeus

montanus with many both visions

reuelations and prophesies by maximilla quintilla and with much seeming deuotion and mortification which deceaued euen that learned tertullian witnesse apollinaris

miltiades apollonius and serapion in eusebius

martiades and martianus who made archangels creatours of the world with many harmonies symphonies

or propheticall reuelations witnesse epiphanius

manes the authour of the maniches iulian the apostata vincentins the donatist with many such like witnesse augustine

and theodoret
in like manner he hath deluded many of late with such like feigned reuelations as the lollards in england as the begards or beguines in belgia the illuminated in spaine as munzer the founder of the anabaptists and many of his followers campanus in germany francis de la crux in india
yea many in england who either would haue sacrificed their children as in crauen in yorkeshire

diuers anno
questioned for it at yorke attempted or els did sacrifice them as one gray a who for killing and cutting in peeces his owne sonne and vttering treasons against king iames was executed at dublin in ireland

in which kind of illusions he hath gone so farre as to persuade some that they were saints our lady our sauiour yea the trinity it selfe
thus in india he persuaded a famous doctour

deluded by the familiarity of a woman who was instructed as she feigned fro an angel that he should be not only a king pope who should translate the popedome to india but also was more holy then angels had the hypostaticall

vnion of god offered him

was the redeemer of the world quoad efficacia for that end should worke miracles which by scripture shew of miracles to the admira+tion of al euen to the fire death he defe~ded
thus in spaine he persuaded gondisalues that he was the sonne of god eternal immortal the sauiour of all euen the damned

which he

published in a booke pretended by him to be dictated by the holy ghost
in france he deluded one

eun a britaine another at bourges a third at burdeaux all of them to thinke that themselues were christ
in poland he persuaded one

melstincke in the tyme of sigismonde at cracouia to make himselfe christ and with twelue apostles to passe vp and downe the country and make shew of miracles in dispossessing of diuels raysing of the dead doing by magicke thinges to the vulgar strange and admirable till discouered they by whiping were forced to confesse their illusion
in the he persuaded

dauid george that he was the nephew of god borne of the holy ghost a third dauid the true messias sent to adopt men children of god and to fill heauen
also a

religious woman that one while the diuell another while iesus christ did speake in and that she had power to consecrate which she presumed to do the body of christ by the power of our sauiour speaking in her
in england he persuaded in queene elizabeths tyme one moore to belieue himselfe to be christ and geffrey his companion to preach it till by whipping at a cart they both disclaimed it
and hacket also after them to belieue that he was also christ come with his fanne in his hand to iudge the earth which coppinger arthington defended till hacket was hanged for it
by all which most lamentable examples of sathans deluding so many and some so learned

it is more then apparent that notwithstanding the former rules of discerning spirits yet sathan can so assimilate himselfe and his suggestions to the spirit and inspirations of god good angels

that it is hard to discerne viam colubri super petram the way of this adder vpon the rocke of mans hart and to find out his turninges and windinges among so many his trickes of

deceit and subtilty
of which yet in the next section more are discouered and by variety of more examples confirmed

svbdiv

sathans subtilty by exteriour visions

the third art the diuell vseth is by illusion of sensible visions and apparitions that when his inward motions either to sinne knowne or secret or to sinne vnder the shadow of vertue cannot preuaile or his suggestions insteed of reuelations are discouered

then he transfigures himselfe into visible shapes and apparitions not of a serpent as he did to eua but sometymes of a holy man
sometymes of an angell sometimes of our lady and our blessed sauiour himselfe and the trinity and appearing in the forme of the as though he were one of them
he by that dissimulation seekes to lure soules to his whistle and to catch them in his net of perdition

in this manner he appeared to our sauiour in the shape of some venerable man as is before proued and tempted him to know if he were god he presumed to approach to the presence of god

and stood among the sons of god to assist before our lord

as though he had byn one of them to obtaine licence to persecute iob
thus he clymed vp to the throne of god and intruded himselfe among the hoast of heauen as micheas saw him about our lord and his throne

and offered to go forth and be a lying prophet in the mouth of all the prophets to deceaue achab and make him belieue that he should fight prosperously against the king of syria
thus in imitation of the angell in zachary

he made to zedechias the false prophet of achab hornes of iron and prophesied though falsly

vvith these hornes shalt thou strike syria till thou destroyest it and so brought to achab and iosaphat to fight to both their dangers and achabs destruction
thus did he appeare to the virgin and martyr iuliana in the midest of his torments vnder dioclesian

in the shape of a glorious angel telling her he was the angell of our lord sent for that end to wish her to auoid the torments by counterfeiting the offering of sacrifice because god was not so cruell as to expect

the fortitude of brasse in mortall bodyes and had deceaued her if god had not by her prayers sent a voice from heauen to bewray him and confort her

thus he appeared to an hermit witnesse ephrem in the shape of an angel shining like the sunne at midnight in his cell while he was singing told him he was so blessed that none was like to him thereby to exalt him to pride had not his humble confessing him to be a sinner and calling vpon iesus him vanish away in smoke

thus he shewed himself to simeon stylites vpo his pillar witnesse antonius his scholer in the forme of an angel with a fiery chariot and horses saying he was sent to take him as another elias to heauen because the angells apostles martyrs and prophets with our lady desired to see him had deceaued him if with the signe of the crosse which he made as he was about to set his foot into the chariot he had not driuen him away
in the like sort he appeared to iohn the hermite who foretould theodosius of his victory and would haue had him to adore him
thus he deceaued a certaine monk witnes cassianus to whome after many false reuelations

he shewed the christians with the apostles mourning and moyses with the iewes reioycing thereby persuaded him to circumcise himselfe and become a iew
thus in the shap of moyses witnesse socrates he persuaded many iewes in creete to cast themselues from a rocke into the sea

in assurance to passe the sea dry foot and so to enter againe into the land of promise

sometimes this audacious dissembler hath not beene afraid to assume to himselfe thereby the easier to deceaue the shape and representation of the mother of the sonne of god and of god of the trinity it selfe

thus of ancient we read how he appeared to martin glorious like a king richly adorned and crowned saying to him am christ who am descended fro heauen to visit thee had deceaued him if martin inspired by god to know him had not sayd will not belieue that christ will come in any forme but that in which he was crucified at which he vanished away
how he appeared to secundillus a deaco in the shape of christ in

his cell saying am christ to whome thou so much prayest thereby not only persuaded him to leaue his cell and to go abroad into the countrey and do good but also did by him cure diseases and do strange cures whereupon being by his superiour reprehended became penitent commanding the diuell that if he were christ he should shew the crosse on which he suffered

he thereupon and at the signe of the crosse vanished away and left him
how he appeared to other two mentioned by gerson and bonauenture in the same forme saying am christ to whome the one shutting his eyes and saying desire to see christ in heauen not on earth and the other saying am not worthy to see christ because am a sinnefull man the diuell vanished
how he appeared to pachomius saying am christ and am come to thee my faythful seruant

which the holy man by the perturbation of his mind perceauing to be a diuel with the signe of the crosse made him to vanish
how to valens a monke he appeared like christ

accompanied with many angells and caused him to come forth of his cell and adore him left him so distracted and raging that they were forced to bind him

of examples of later tymes we read that he molested the holy man ignatius in the founding of his order of the society

not only interiourly by suggestions which he did at his study when by high and mysticall illuminations he withdrew his attention from his learning the grammer rules to which he had seriously applyed himselfe but also by visible apparitions

when at manresa in his first entrance into a spirituall course he appeared in the forme of a beautiful person with many colours and eyes compassing the crosse before which he prayed which ignatius by the pensiuenes and perturbation of his mind discouering caused him by his prayer to vanish

that in the alpes the diuell hauing seduced a priest

who had the sacrament about him to go in curiosity with him to see a wonder brought him to a pallace most beautiful pleasant where a lady in a throne was presented by many prostrating themselues before her with rich guiftes vntill the priest offering the sacrament

to her thinking it was our lady she and all vanished away and left him in a strange place many miles distant from his habitation

thirdly to an hermite

and a religious man deceaued by him in germany in a desart place to which they were carryed he appeared in the shape of christ a king and our lady a queene both glorious set in a rich pallace vpon a shining throne with thousands of angells and saints about them and receaued al adoration from them till by the sacrament which the religious had in a pixe offered to them al vanished away

that he appeared to certaine women about milan the yeare
in the habit now of a monke now of vrsula with many virgins with her and now of our sauiour amo~g whome he persuaded one to be religious and leaue the world and would not desist till she tould him

she would not do any thing without the aduice of her ghostly father
and to conclude we read how while norbert the fou~der of the praemonstratenses was meditating vpon the trinity

the diuell appeared with three heads telling him that for his deuotion he had deserued to see the trinity which by the perturbations of his mind he perceauing to be the diuell defied him and so was rid of him
all which with many more the diuels apparitions and illusions in histories most authenticall recorded what are they but so many conuincing arguments to proue both the difficulty of discerning spirits and also the impossibility of euery priuate spirit to do it

the difficulty to discerne spirits proued by scripture
sect


the last reason

to proue the difficulty of discerning spirits is authority which is a confirmation to all the former experiences and examples of holy scripture and holy men placing the guift of discerning of spirits among the guifts of graces gratis giuen to some the discerning of spirits doth shew that as the rest of the guifts to wit miracles

tongues prophesies and interpreting of scripture of which before and the rest are rare extraordinary and giuen to few and that vsually and necessarily conioyned with grace or fayth in euery faithfull belieuer so also this of discerning spirits is in like manner a guift not co~municated to euery faythfull belieuer who hath the spirit of god but rarely and extraordinarily to some who haue the priuiledg of this benefite bestowed vpon them for the benefit of others
for as it is proper to god both to be and to be called

ponderator spirituum the weigher and discerner of spirits in the same manner as he is the knower of harts

vvho only knowes the hartes of all the children of men so doth he communicate this guift to some speciall persons whome he makes as the prophets cal them

proouers and strong proouers in my people who shall know and prooue their wayes in the same manner as in the common wealth are tryers of gold to discerne true from false
and to these by a speciall prerogatiue he giues this guift that they

may prooue spirits if they be good and

try them as gold is tryed in the fire and

separate the precious from the vile declaring when it is good or a good angell who knocks at the doore and when it is sathan and the bad angell who transfigures himselfe into an angell of light
and as this guift is rare giuen only to some so it is for the most part giuen to superiours

who are to direct others in the way of vertue and perfection amo~g these to them who are men humble as cassianus affirmes and very spirituall also because not the sensuall man but the spirit of god perceaues the thinges which are of god

these partly by long experience partly by wholesome documents partly by diuine inspirations attaine to this perfectio of discercerning spirits
by which is apparent that the science of discerning spirits is hard and difficult because it requires so speciall and supernaturall a guift which is so rare and extraordinary and that to speciall kind of persons for the good of others

which is also confirmed by the testimony of holy men who haue laboured much and beene experienced long in this science
bernard a man extraordinarily spirituall

confesseth that he knew not vvhen the spirit entred or when it departed which way it came or which it went

sometyms he could perceaue it to be present or to haue beene present but neither when it came or how it went
gerson a man learned who laboured and writ much about this discerning of spirits

after much discussion sayth that it is a most hard thing to discerne among so many spirits since in diuerse and contrary spirits there is sush a similitude of inspirations
thomas kempis one much enlightned in spirituall affaires sayth marke the motions of thyne own nature and my grace for in very contrary and secret manner these are moued and can hardly be discerned but by him that is spirituall and inwardly enlightned
ludouicus puentes also a maister in spirituall wayes sayth that it seemes often an inspiration of god which is an impulsion of sathan and it often carryes a shew of spirituall loue which is indeed false and carnall loue

and thus it remaines conuinced by reasons drawne from the verity and similitude of spirits by the subtilty and craft of sathan who so often and many wayes transfigures himselfe into an angell by the infirmity of mans vnderstanding so vnable to penetrate them and by authority of scripture and testimony of holy men so experienced in this science that the art of discerning of spirits is most hard and difficult in it selfe and aboue the reach and capacity of euery priuate mans ability

out of all which it doth follow
first

that visions and apparitions are often tymes doubtfull and dangerous and so rather to be feared whether they be true or false and to what end they do tend then to be desired or esteemed as signes of holynesse and perfection
for as the guifts gratis giuen prophesy curing of diseases and dispossessing of diuells are giuen sometymes to persons lesse perfect in vertue if not vicious in life and vnbelieuers for fayth witnesse the prophesyes of the sybils being gentils of christ of

baalam a sorcerer of the starre of iacob of

caiphas most wicked of christ dying for all of

saul a reprobate who had the spirit and was among the prophets all which had the gift of prophesy
witnesse also the sonnes of the

pharisies who cast out diuels the seauen sonnes of

sceua with

the exorcists of the iewes who dispossessed many of diuels so also these visions and apparitions are neither so proper to holy men but that often they are communicated to bad and wicked nor yet so certaine that they are alwayes of god or good angells but that they often proceed from satan and as the visions of those spirits so also the guift of discerning the same is neyther so proper omni and soli to all and only the good and faythfull but that it is sometymes giuen to them who are lesse holy and more wicked of life
whereupon holy and wise learned men as augustine bonauenture and gerson aduise and persuade that not only such visions and apparitions are to be feared yea auoided and not desired but also ordinary persons who haue them and make shew or ostentation of them are not to be applauded or admired for them as pious but seuerely to be reprehended suspected as proud and dangerous who are not content to tread the high way and beaten path to perfection but will seeke out new and walke in wonders aboue the~selues
also many holy persons who haue beene extraordinarily visited from god with them haue alwayes with that warinesse accepted of them that they did vse great diligence to examine them before they would confide in the
thus

iacob secretly and diligently considered the visions of ioseph his sonne related to him

iosue doubted therupon examined the angell who did appeare to him like an armed man whether he was of their side or of the aduersaries

samuel heard our lord when he called him in the night samuel samuel but did not answere till he rose and went to heli the high priest to know what he should do

elias seriously deliberated whether our lord did appeare in the whirle wind or in the commotion or in the fire or in the soft whispering wind
and our

lady cogitabat did muse or study that is maturely and long sayth euthymius consider what kind of salutation that was whether of god or the diuell
and the like did the bishop of cyprus at the apparition of barnaby
and ambrose at the inue~tion of geruasius and protasius
and other holy saints in all such like occasions fearing alwayes illusions of sathan insteed

of apparitions of angells

secondly
it doth follow that it is necessary to auoid all these and such like dangers

to haue euery one a spirituall directour and maister on whome as better experienced by practise more illuminated by god in his place functio he may more securely rely then vpon his owne spirit or iudgment
for as the wayes in which men walke are many the right way to heauen not easy to be found as in the way being found there are many either pits to fall in or theeues to robbe and spoile vs as the science we are to learne is very heard and intricate to which our natural wit cannot attaine and the diseases infirmities of our body are many great for which we are vnable to trauell so long and laborious a iourney so haue we need great need of a guide to lead vs in a way so vncertaine and dangerous of a maister to instruct vs in a trade so hard and vnknowne and of a phisitian to cure vs of so many infirmities and diseases
and as no man hath power to absolue himselfe of his sinnes as no man is made iudge in his owne cause as no man is permitted to minister phisicke to his owne body so god hath ordained that no man shal be instructer directour of his owne soule nor conductour of himselfe in his way to life but stil depend vpon others to direct and instruct him in the same
for thus our sauiour first himselfe for example

would sit hearing and asking among the doctours as though he were a scholler
for this cause he sent his vessel of election paul

to be instructed by ananias and would not immediatly himselfe direct him what to doe
for this god would not instruct moyses in the mountaine himselfe but sent him to iethro a gentill by him to receaue direction how to gouerne his people

for this augustine being old refused not to be instructed by his companions yet yong
and thus we read that some who haue had familiar conuersations with angels

were yet permitted by them to hould some errours in doctrine till they humbled themselues to others and by them were instructed
for which it is a generall rule that he who will not be a disciple to another shalbe a maister of errour and that he who makes himselfe maister to himself puts himselfe to be scholler

to a foole
all which if it be true in morall sciences mysteries of faith most true it is in discerning of these spirits in which the difficulty is greater the da~ger of errour no lesse


to conclude it doth follow that since there is such variety of spirits some good as of god of angels and of saints

and some bad as of diuels of the damned of the flesh and of the world sith there be so diuers kinds of motions apparitions of these spirits some intellectuall some imaginary some sensible and visible sith there are so great difficulties to be resolued about these seuerall apparitions so great similitude in their motions and apparitions so many rules and differences vpon long experience haue beene giuen to discerne them and so great skill cunning is requisite to apply them sith there be so many and so dangerous wayes to take as of pagans iewes turks heretikes all differing condemning one another all depending vpon the motions of these spirits sith such and so high is the excellency of the nature of these spirits to be discerned such and so weake the infirmity of man to discerne them such and so subtile malicious and powerfull is mans enemy the diuell to deceaue in them by counterfeit dissimulation of piety or by forged illusions insteed of reuelations or by outward apparitions in forme of saints angels or god all by verity of examples confirmed sith so speciall extraordinary so rare and vnvsuall is this gift of discerning these spirits sith say all this is so as is proued with what reason and iudgment can any man make this priuat spirit or rather conceit of his owne braine a competent sufficient and infallible iudge to discerne and decide al these questions and difficulties arising vpon them what madnesse senslesse presumption is it for euery silly simple and vnlearned person man or woman all of which challe~g this spirit to assume so much to themselues and presume so farre vpon their owne conceit as to discerne and declare which of euery one of these spirits is of god the deuill or nature which is good or bad which true or false either in the~selues or others and vpon this presumption to ground the certainty of their religion faith and saluation

what greater temerity and rashnes can there be then to build a worke so great and important as is the eternity of saluation or damnation vpon no more solid and certaine a ground then is the proper conceit of euery priuate motion of an vncertaine spirit surely if men were not blind or bewitched and that either willfully or foolishly blinded or bewitched and both so deeply that they eyther will not or cannot see what both sense reason doth dictate to their owne conscience what both authority and testimony of god and holy men doth lay before them what both examples experience of so many ages doth confirme vnto the surely they could not but often doubt and distruct many tymes stagger and relent their owne iudgment conscience doubtlesse pricking them in this their ostentation of the certainty of their spirit they could not but sometyms enter into consideration yea and feele a sensible touch of trepidation in soule and stand in a wonder and amazeme~t at themselues how they dare venture so far and stand so confidently in so weighty a matter vpon the judgement of so vncertaine vnconstant vnwarranted yea corrupted deceitfull and partiall a iudge as is this their priuate spirit conceit imagination
what man of reason and discretion or of care conscience will not hould it farre more secure and safe in these points of eternity with euery good catholike to ioyne his spirit with the spirit of the saints and seruants of god now reigning in heauen to subiect his spirit to the spirit of gods holy church heere on earth guided infallibly by an infallible spirit of god and by conforming themselues to this spirit to imbrace and follow that fayth and religion that doctrine and discipline that sacrifice and sacraments which so many saints and holy men so many confessours and learned doctours so many churches and councells in all ages throughout all countryes belieued in their harts professed by their liues defended by their writinges and sealed and confirmed with their liues bloud and thus much for the first reason against the priuate spirit drawne from the difficulty to discerne spirits

the private spirits avthority to interprete scripture and iudge of fayth confuted by reasons drawne from the true and infallible authority and meanes of interpreting holy scripture
chap
vvhat interpretation authority and meanes are necessary infallible for the sense of scripture
sect
svbdiv

what interpretation of scripture is necessary

the better to vnderstand the reasons drawne from the infallible authority and meanes of interpreting of holy scripture by which the priuate spirits authority is confuted we may consider
what interpretatio that is which is required as necessary

what authority as infallible is required to this intetpretation and

in whome it is resident

what meanes are to be vsed and followed as certaine by these interpreters to this interpretation
out of all which may be inferred and proued the insufficiency of the priuate spirit to be eyther authour or meanes of this interpretation of scripture

first therefore when we speake of the sense and interpretation of scripture

we speake not of that sense and interpretation which is only probable and credible but of that which is certaine and infallible
not of that which is only for the pulpit and documents of manners or which is for the schooles and subtiltyes of diuinity but of that which is for doctrine of fayth and articles of beliefe
not of that which is only to confirme and increase vs in that fayth which we already belieue but of that which is to persuade and produce fayth a new eyther in our selues when and why we first belieue or in others whome we persuade first to belieue
and this is that sense of scripture which as it is being rightly vnderstood in the sense which the holy ghost intended a firme and solide foundation of true fayth so being falsly vnderstood and wikedly peruerted by false teachers it is the mother or nurse of al heresies
for as nothing is persuaded as worthy of beliefe but which is true or vnder the shew of truth and as the scripture is by all granted to be most true so all vse the text of scripture as a meane to persuade that which they would haue to be belieued as true the true teachers in the true sense the false in the false sense both cyting the wordes and text but the one in that sense and meaning which the holy ghost intended

the other in that which they themselues inuented
which course of false sense as the diuell first beganne when he would haue by scripture persuaded christ to cast himselfe downe headlong saying it is written

he hath giuen his angels charge ouer thee so the members of sathan follow the same way and labour by the same scripture to seduce the members of christ as the faythlesse the faythfull the sacrilegious the religious the heretikes the catholikes
for the iewes would by scripture haue proued that christ was not only not messias saying search the scriptures and see that from gallilee

a prophet ryseth not but also that he was a malefactour and such a one as ought to dye

saying vve haue a law and according to our law he ought to dye
and the same is continued both by turkes who receaue both the old and new testament but interpreted according to mahomets alcaron and also by all heretiks who seek to fill their books not o~ly with words of scripture but sayth vincent
lyrin
with thousands of testimonies thousands of examples thousands of authorityes out of the law the psalmes the prophets the apostles which expounded after a new and ill manner would thereby throw downe soules from the tower of catholike fayth to the pit of wicked heresy being as our sauiour sayth of them false prophets or teachers who vnder the garments of sheep that is sayth vincent
lyrin the wordes of the prophets and apostles are rauenous vvolues infesting the fold of the church and deuouring the flocke of christ and saying christ is heere or there that is as origen expounded it in this or that text of scripture who thus transfiguring themselues into the shew of apostles or preachers of christ do labour to transfer the people into another ghospell who depraue the scripture to their owne and others destruction and by the wordes of the law sayth ambrose

impugne the law and do frame a false sense of the wordes of the law that they may confirme their owne peruerse opinions by the authority of the law
against al whome we may note the wordes of hilary

saying that heresy is about the vnderstanding not the text of scripture the sense not the words is the sinne
and of hierome that the ghospell is not in the wordes

but the sense of scripture not in the outward rine but in the inward marrow not in the leaues of wordes but in the root of the sense

svbdiv

who haue authority to make the interpretation of scripture

secondly this sense and meaning of scripture because it is not facil and easy to be knowne to all by reason of the great obscurity in the wordes the great fecundity in the sense and the great profundity in the mysteries or articles

belieued which cannot by euery one nor by any one without the assistance of the same spirit which penned it be vnderstood therfore is necessary some authentical certain and infallible authority for the true vnderstanding of this authenticall certaine and infallible sense of scripture
this authority because it is in the catholike church chiefly in the pastours and prelates of the same for the better gouernement of it in true doctrine vpon whom god hath bestowed the infallible assistance of his holy spirit as is afterward proued therfore their authority is necessary for the finding out the true and certaine sense of scripture
whensoeuer therfore the chiefe pastour or pastours of the church vsing the meanes for it appointed of which in the next proposition do either ex cathedra or in a councell confirmed approued or by a generall consent propose deliuer and declare any sense or exposition of scripture as true and to be belieued as an article of faith in any controuersy against heretikes then is that sense to be receaued for their authority as authenticall certaine and infallible

from whence ensues that though in matters of philosophy and reason we must rather attend what is said the by whome it is said and respect rather the force then the authority of the person who sayes it yet in matters of faith we must first respect them who preach and the authority and commission of their person and by it iudge of their doctrine preached
for if the person be lawfully sent if he haue lawfull commission if he be a lawfull pastour not deuided by heresy or schisme from the whole body then the people are to attend to him and for his commission to receaue his doctrine but if he want mission commissio if he teach of himselfe and his owne authority if he produce the doctrine not of the but of his owne inuention let him teach what he wil proue it how he wil he is not to be heard nor belieued by the common and vulgar people to whom it belonges to be obedient subiect to the authority of their pastour

not to iudge of the verity of his doctrine more then in generall whether it be consonant or dissonant from the vniuersally receaued doctrine of

the church for they are to

obey their pastours to remaine in the same rule

in the faith first deliuered

in that which they heard from the beginning

to auoid profane nouelties of words

not to receiue any other ghospel

or doctrine

but that which they learned and receaued from the beginning leauing the particulars to the testimony of others either equal to their pastour in function or superiour to him in authority
which point is to be noted against the manichees of old and the protestants of late who respect not the authority of the preacher but the force of his reason attend not to the commission of the pastour who he is that teacheth but to the plausibility of his doctrine what it is and how far it is pleasing to their priuat spirit disposition or iudgment

svbdiv

what meanes are to be vsed to make this interpretation and of foure rules of infallible interpreting of scripture

thirdly
the meanes which are to be obserued vsed and followed by these pastours or prelats for the securing vs of this true sense of scripture are these

the rule of faith that is the catholike and vniuersally receiued doctrine of faith and piety which was deliuered by the apostles receiued by posterity

the generall practise or obseruatio custome or tradition of the whole church in pointes where the doctrine is not certaine

the auncient exposition or consent of the holy fathers and doctours of the primitiue church where the former do not appeare

the decrees and definitions of the councels either generall or prouincial approued by generall and the conformity to them in all expositions doubtfull
are as so many rules or conducts according to which the certaine and authenticall sense of scripture is by the pastours of gods church to be squared and guided

first that the rule of fayth is to be presupposed obserued and followed in the finding out the true sense of scripture is proued

this rule of fayth is by paul who often

doth mention it called sometymes a rule which bringeth peace vvho

haue followed this rule peace be on them
sometimes a rule in which they are to remaine to auoid dissentions let

vs remaine in the same rule that we may iudge the same
sometymes his rule which he deliuered to them and by which they are to increase in fayth your

fayth increasing according to our rule
sometymes a reason of fayth according to which is giuen the guift of prophesy or interpretation of scripture donations

or prophesy according to the rule of fayth
and in effect it is no other but the

doctrine they receaued

the fayth preached through the whole world

the disposition or forme of true doctrine which they had learned and is committed to them the

doctrine which they receaued fro the beginning vvhich

was first euangelized to them or

the precepts of the apostles and ancients or

rather of our sauiour deliuered by the holy prophets and apostles and

the word of god which remaines for euer
that the knowledge of this rule or doctrine of fayth is presupposed to the true knowledge and vnderstanding of scripture is proued both by scripture and reason
by scripture the prophet isay sayth as cyprian

and augustine do both of them read and vnderstand it except you belieue you cannot vnderstand that is sayth cyprian the iewes cannot vnderstand the scripture except they first belieue in christ
augustine sayth there be some of you who vnderstand not and therefore they vnderstand not

because they belieue not let vs first adhere by fayth that we may be reuiued by vnderstanding
and in another place fayth must go before vnderstanding that the vnderstanding may be the reward of fayth
therefore fayth and the rule of fayth is necessary before the vnderstanding of scripture

secondly the scripture for the sense is a booke sealed with seauen seales these seales none can open but he who hath the

key of dauid
this key of dauid is giuen only to them who are faythfull with dauid therfore the key of faith is requisit to the opening the sense of the booke of scripture which is confirmed by hierome

who alleadging the same words sayth the law is spirituall and requires reuelation that it be vnderstood
for proofe of which he produceth the example of the eunuch who read but vnderstood not the scripture till philip did expound it to him made him faythfull and so became of a scholler a maister

thirdly euery learned scribe in the kingdome of heauen is like to a man the maister of a family who bringeth out of his treasure new and old
the scribes were the maisters and interpreters of scripture but they were in the kingdome of heauen that is in the church by fayth and so did interprete the new and old testament which augustine alleadging to the same purpose against the manichees sayth you

vnderstand not because you belieue not as sayth say for you are not instructed in the kingdome of heauen that is in the true catholike church of christ for if you were you would produce old and new out of the scriptures
therfore one must be a scholler in the church by fayth before he can come to vnderstand the scripture as a maister

fourthly paul sayth to timothy thou hast learned holy scriptures from thy infancy which are able to instruct thee to saluation by fayth which is in christ
if the scriptures instruct by fayth then fayth is prerequired before we can be instructed by them or vnderstand them

fifthly the holy fathers and doctours of the church haue by the breach of this rule as a signe discerned heretikes and by the authority of it as a strong argument confuted the same
thus were discerned marcion valentinus and basilides by their deprauing the rule of truth

witnesse

irenaeus
thus paulus samosatenus by his forsaking the canon of the church and flying to strange and adulterous doctrine
thus montanus by his vttering strange words contrary to the custome of the church deriued by tradition and succession from the apostles witnes of both

and thus all heretikes by their forsaking the rule of christianity witnesse

they being all esteemed to haue truth on their side who walke according to the rule which the church receaued from the apostles the apostles from christ witnes

tertullian
thus did hierome

confute and confound the heresy of the luciferians by the light of the sunne of the church

gregorius nazianzen the same by the doctrine abhorring the same

millenarians by their transgressing the limits of the holy church of god and the hope of propheticall and apostolicall tradition in fayth and doctrine and the

and other heretikes by the style of christianisme and the phrase of the apostles receaued from the fathers
augustine

the pelagians by the grounded custome of the church hastening to baptisme infants

by the most ancient knowne and vndoubted rule of fayth truth

and by the authority of the church so commended in
the

donatists by the authority of the church and by apostolicall tradition
and both irenaeus origen and augustine did confute all heretikes by the tradition of the apostles manifest to the whole world in the church sayth

irenaeus
by the ecclesiasticall tradition dissented off by none sayth

origen
by the catholike church whose not receauing any opinion is sufficient sayth

augustine to confound any heresy
therfore the doctrine and practise of the ancient fathers was to discerne and confute all heretikes by this rule of fayth

sixthly the same is proued by reason because the scripture is the booke of the faythfull not the faithlesse therefore as it was writ to the faythfull as the conuerted iewes

romans

corinthians so it is vnderstood truely only by the faythfull as the christians not by the infidels as the iewes turkes and heretikes who haue and read the wordes but vnderstand not the sense meaning because the veile is yet ouer their eyes in the reading of it for want of fayth therefore the letter that is the words and reading of it doth kill them and is to them a ministration of death and only the spirit that is the vnderstanding of it doth giue life to them who haue fayth
of which necessity of fayth prerequired to the vnderstanding of scripture see stapleton de principijs doctrinalibus where the same is further proued out of the ancient fathers testimonyes to wit augustine irenaeus origen athanasius cyrill of alexandria theodoret and vincentius lyrin who sayth that the holy and learned men did interprete the holy scripture according to the traditions of the catholike church and the rule of catholike fayth
and againe that the line of propheticall and apostolicall interpretation must be directed according to the rule of the catholike and ecclesiasticall sense
which and much more he alleadges against the custome of heretikes who haue alwayes the scripture in their mouth and out of it do confirme their errours

out of which may be inferred how vntruly and fraudulently the protestants do generally auerre that in the scripture the spirit of god is and is to be sought and found and that by industry and reading of the words and text the spirit is to be found
whereupon they make the words of scripture as they are heard or read not only the organ or instrument of faith as much as wee make the sacrament instrument of grace but also the sole instrument which with diligence read or heard they prescribe as the only meanes to receiue faith and saluation

for first as a man consists of body and soule and the body of it selfe being senslesse dead is the inferiour rt the soule being life and giuing life is the principal part without which he is not man so the scripture consists of the words or text which is read or heard and is only the body barke

or couering of gods word and of the sense and meaning which is vnderstood belieued and is the life soule

and substance of the scripture
now the words as they are written or spoken consisting of letters syllables words are dead without life and common to gentils iewes and hereticks with the faithfull yea in the same manner as the law is called a law of sinne so are they by paul

said to kill to be ministration of death
because according to august
the letter read and not truly vnderstood

or not performed is occasion of heresy and sinne some gathering out of it as out of the flower poison of heresy like the spider others hony of faith like the bee
the sense and meaning as it is truly vnderstood belieued which is properly the word of god is an effectuall meanes more piercing the any sword an operatiue vertue to saluation but to whome

to all that belieue
and to whom it is so proper

that it is by faith only conceaued and attained and by faith only belieued vnderstood

secondly
as the bare letter words

and text of scripture without true sense are not the word of god so they do not containe the spirit of god or the holy ghost in them neither is the holy ghost thus inherent resident or to be sought found in the scripture but in the hart and soule of the writers of scripture that is the prophets or apostles in whom as it did remaine and dictate to them what they writ so did it reueale and manifest to them the true sense meaning of the same though perhaps not alwayes the whole complete meaning and all senses of the scripture for by reason of the fecundity of senses in gods word many

or al of them were not according to augustine alwayes reuealed to the same apostles or prophets but some reserued to the authour of it the holy ghost it selfe
and as the spirit of god is not inherent or resident in the bare words sillables or text of scripture so the spirit or spiritual true sense of scripture is not to be sought or found only in or out of the bare words

and their grammaticall signification but out of the rule of faith expounded according to the ecclesiasticall and catholike doctrine of beliefe
not by humane labour and industry of study but by the meane of faith and diuine reuelation
for the words are translated into other languages different from

that in which they were originally written and haue diuers and various significations and senses as litterall moral allegoricall and anagogicall and are by seuerall expositions drawne to suport diuers seuerall yea contrary faithes and religions
also great labour diligence and study haue beene vsed by many men of great wit learning and knowledge in the expounding seeking out the true sense of scripture who yet haue beene so far from finding it as that they haue inuented many false and heretical meanings and therupon grounded many wicked and damned heresies

out of al which it doth follow that the words of scripture and the diligent and frequent reading or hearing of it are so far from being a necessary meanes of faith much lesse the sole whole meanes to it that faith is a meanes necessary presupposed to the vnderstanding of scripture
for if the scripture consist not in the words and letter only but in the sense vnderstanding principally and if the sense depend not vpon the bare words but vpo the ecclesiastical catholicke rule tradition of faith as is proued then must faith be prerequired as a help and meanes to find out the true sense of scripture
and they who will read scripture must bring faith with them as a help and meanes to vnderstand the scripture and not ground their faith vpon their reading of scripture which being diligently read though it may serue to co~firme and nourish faith in ones selfe or to illustrate and defend it to others and in both being according to the rule of faith interpreted a light to direct them in the way of piety and to enflame them with the heat of charity yet it can neither be a first and firme ground to cause and produce first and certaine faith in any for a man must bring faith to belieue it nor a sufficient meanes to resolue all points of faith necessary to saluation as besids other reasons the practise of so many heresies diuided pretended to be grounded all vpon it doth conuince and the experience made for example of three persons iews turks or pagans all ignorant of christian religion all turned to a bare text of the bible all willed to seeke out and resolue in particular articles formerly or presently controuerted in

christian religion will no doubt by their seuerall contrary resolutions confirme the same
and thus much of the rule of faith as a necessary meanes of expounding scripture

the second meanes of expounding the holy scriprure

is the generall practise or obseruation the publike custome or tradition of the whole church in the exercise of any religious seruice or worship or in the practise of any sacrifice sacrament or ceremony in which as the church it selfe cannot erre so it may be a guide in expounding the scripture to keep others from errour that where the doctrine of the church is not euident there the practise and obseruation of the same may serue
this practise we will proue by the practise of the chiefe doctours in gods church for by this did the ancient fathers expound many places and conuince many heretikes
by this practise admitting the lapsed to penna~ce did epiphanius conuince the nouatians who reiected them
by this practise of saying glory be to the father

the sonne and the holy ghost did basil conuince origen about the deity of the holy ghost vrging his owne practise with the rest against origens owne doctrine against the rest

by this practise of baptizing in the name of the father the sonne the holy ghost did theodoret conuince arius

who denyed the equality of the sonne with the father
by this practise of exorcising breathing vpon infants in the sacrame~t of baptisme did augustine affirme the bishops of palestine to haue expounded that of rom
in whome all sinned

of originall sinne deriued from adam by propagation not imitation only

by this same practise of the church praying for the conuersion of infidels and perseuerance of the faythfull did he proue against the same pelagians grace of predestination and perseuerance
by the same practise did he reconcile those places of scripture of eating all that is set before vs

and of not eating with sinners
and to omit many other by the same practise of the church not rebaptizing them baptized by heretikes did he refuse to adhere to cyprian and his opinion and confuted him and all the bishops of africa

cappadocia bythinia and the rest who maintained the contrary
and to conclude by this practise which he had learned publikly pages missing

eusebius

did also alleadge iustinus miltiades tatian clemens irenaeus meliton and others against artemon

the same that did these fathers did also the generall councels
the first councell of nice by the testimonyes which they had from the fathers witnes athanasius did decree against arius
the councell of ephesus following the confessions of the fathers sayth it selfe and alleadging sayth vincent lyr in particuler most of the east and vvest doctours as maisters confessours witnesses iudges held their doctrine followed their counsell belieued their testimony obeyed their iudgment and so pronounced their sentence of fayth against nestorius
the councell of calcedon following sayth it selfe the holy fathers the faith of the fathers the exposition of the fathers doth determine what is pious and catholike fayth against eutiches
the sixth generall councell witnesse both the letters of pope agatho and the synode it selfe doth produce the testimonyes of fathers for the exposition of scripture and thereby condemned the monothelites
the seauenth generall councell and the second of nice doth the same witnesse the letters of pope adrian against the
and the councell of vienna witnesse the letters of pope clement in their definitions
so that all antiquity whether in priuate disputations or in publike definitions hath alwayes vsed the testimony of fathers as a meane in declaring the authenticall sense of scripture against heretikes

the fourth and most infallible meane of expounding the scripture is a councell either generall or prouinciall confirmed by a generall in which whatsoeuer is not obiter by the way nor as a proofe only but on set purose and as a conclusion or definition deliuered and defined that is without all question or examination to be receaued as a certaine infallible and authenticall sense of scripture
which to omit all testimonies before cyted for the authority of councels is proued by the practise of the faythfull in all councels

for in the nicen councell were many places of scriptures for proofe of the consubstantiality of christ produced and discussed and the orthodoxe fathers vrged and pressed diuers texts of the same
the arians answered and

interpreted them and vrged likwise many against the same
the conclusion was the fathers of the councell preuailed and concluded both the doctrine of christs diuinity the sense of the places of scripture alleadged for it
this definition was to all posterity so forcible that though the arians vsed all force of temporall power

which afterward was wholy for them though they summoned as athanasius saith aboue ten cou~cels or conuenticles against that one though they sought in a councell at hierusalem to restore their bishops deposed and in a councell at antioch to bring in a new forme of faith couched in words not vnlike to the nicene forme and in a councell at smirna did affirme craftily the sonne to haue beene before his mother and before all times and not a creature like to others though in the councell at ariminum they deceaued many catholicke bishops and cunningly obtruded undefined span alphabet for undefined span alphabet like substance for the same substance which in greek differed only in a letter though they sent legates into italy france and al places with faire shewes and promises of vnion of subscribing and of submitting themselues but cunningly and disemblingly as the protestants did at the first and chiefly melanchton bucer about transubstantiation yet to all posterity and succeeding ages those places of scripture haue euer beene receaued and beleiued in that sense which the councell then interpreted and vrged them so that that councel hath beene a rule euer since for the exposition of them to all faithfull and true belieuers in christ
in like manner in the councell of ephesus

hauing discussed diuers places before controuerted whether they were spoken of the natures or persons of christ resolued that they were to be vnderstood of plurality of natures not persons in christ
and though nestorius the eloquent patriarch of constantinople and many bishops with him withstood the councell and though theodoret the most learned catholicke bishop of that age long opposed cyrill about the same yet the authority of the councell so far preuailed both then and euer since that all faithfull euer after haue alwayes receaued expounded them in the same sense as true and condemned the contrary

as false
and the like might be produced of other places for the humanity of christ against the manichees and apollinarists
for his two natures against the eutichians and monothelites
for the holy ghost against the macedonians eunomians
and so for transubstantiation against berengarius and the sacramentaries which for breuity are omitted

and thus much of these foure rules or meanes to wit
the rule of faith

the practise of the church

the consent of fathers and
the decrees of councels by which the pastours and prelates of gods church are to be directed and vpon which we may infallibly rely for any true certaine authenticall infallible sense of scripture
there be other helps which are good and profitable

as the consideration of the antecedents and consequences of places the conference of one place with another the obseruation of and the skill examination of the originall texts but because they are neither certaine nor infallible but only probable yea often doubtfull and somtimes deceitfull nor yet proper and peculiar to christians but co~mon to iewes pagans heretiks and all sortes and also not to our purpose for the present therfore we will omit them and shew that the priuate spirit which the protestants most insist vpon and which we vndertake to confute neither is nor can be any certaine and infallible meanes of interpreting scripture as they do both in doctrine and pactise mantaine

that the priuate spirit cannot haue this infallible authority and be this infallible meanes
sect
ii

these being supposed for the finding out the authority certaine and meanes necessary for true interpretation of holy scripture it remaines to be proued that the priuate spirit of euery particular man neither hath in it any

certainty or authority nor yet can be a fit meanes vpo which any certaine and authenticall exposition of scripture can be grounded
which is to be performed two wayes

by reasons drawne from the property and condition of the holy scripture and the sense and meaning of it

by reasons drawne from the property and condition of the priuate spirit and the vncertainty and deceitfulnes of it

svbdiv

by reasons drawne from the nature of holy scripture which is to be expounded

first therefore for the holy scripture

such is the difficulty of it which ariseth partly from the ambiguity of the words including diuers significations partly from the fecu~dity of the significatio~s affording multiplicity of senses partly from the profundity of the matter inuolued in misteries obscure and exceeding our capacity such say is the difficulty of the scripture which aryseth out of these grounds that no priuate man nor any priuate spirit of any man can secure himselfe of the certainty of any much lesse of all of them
for if we respect the words and text of scripture

this spirit cannot vpon any ground assure any man that either this booke rather then another is the diuine word of god or of this booke that this is the true and complete canon or of this canon that this is the first and originall text or of this text that it is the right authenticall translation or of this translation that any one rather the another is the true and canonical sense or of these senses that one more then other containes all articles and points necessary to saluation all which are yet necessary to be expounded
this spirit cannot expresse and assure what booke is canonicall and what not
it cannot accord the lutherans and caluinists whether the epistle to the hebrewes of iames
of peter the
and
of iohn nor the catholikes and protestants

whether the bookes of machabees toby iudith hester be canonicall or not
it ca giue no reason why there should be admitted into the canon of scripture the gospels of mathew marke luke

and iohn and not the gospels of thomas nathanael matthias thadaeus bartholomew iames iohn andrew paul nicodemus the hebrews the egiptia~s with that of peter or the nazarits
it can giue no reason why the epistles of paul iames iohn iude peter should be admitted and why not those of barnabas of luke the rest of peter of paul that to the laodiceans the to the corinthians the to the thessalonians
it can giue no reason why the acts writ by luke should be and not the acts writ by peter by paul and by andrew thomas iohn philip and matthias nor the periods of paul thecla nor the constitutions of the apostles or the booke of hermes or enoch why the apocalyps of iohn should be amittted not the apocalyps of peter paul thomas

stephen elias nor the death of our lady the circuite of iohn the sentences of bartholomew the ascension of esie all which haue beene extant and by some challenged as canonicall as may be seene in doctour stapleton

it cannot resolue and assure what bookes were originally writ in hebrew

what in the chaldean what in the greeke or latine tongue who they were that writ the bookes of the old testament and whether they be the same which were first written and the same sound and vncorrupted
whether this hebrew text be the same either in character or letter of which is question or in wordes of which many doubt which was first written
what is the sense signification phrase or stile of any hebrew word
whether the greeke of the septuaginte which the apostles followed be sound and incorrupted and to be preferred before the hebrew
whether the ancient latin vulgar or others of later translation as of erasmus luther oecolampadius bibliander beza castalio tremelius and others be to be followed
whether of any english translations the catholike translation of the rhemist or the protestants of tindall of king edward of the bishops of geneua or of king iames are to be receaued as true which is to be rejected as false
none of these can the priuate spirit in euery ordinary man nor yet in the learned protestant certainly decide and resolue
it cannot satisfy and assure when the wordes are in

the literall or mysticall sense to be vnderstood

and for the literall when it passeth from speaking of thinges carnall to thinges spirituall from temporal to eternall from the kingdome of israell to the kingdome of christ as often in the psalmes and prophets it doth
as for exa~ple from the kings of syria and israell to our lady

christ
from the king of babylon to

lucifer
from salomon to

christ
from the barly bread to the sacramentall

bread
and for the mysticall sense when it is to be vnderstood morally for manners when allegorically of christ or the church militant when anagogically of glory or the church triu~phant
when the same wordes beare a proper

and when a figuratiue sense and of the figuratiue sense when the figure is synecdoche the part for the whole
when metonimya the signe or cause for the effect
when it is catechresis by which the inuentour of a thing is called father cittyes are called daughters posterity is called house
when by hiperbole or exageration the whole world is put for much all for many
when by liptote or diminution idols are called vaine thinges vnprofitable
when by analoge one person tyme number gender or signification is set for another
when by two thinges are put for one as signes and tymes for signes of tymes
when by prolepsis or anticipation places citties are named by names which afterward were giue them
when by analoge or mutation one sense as seeing is set for another as hearing tasting
when by hetorosis the abstracte as abomination for the concrete as abominable
by haebraisme causalites or similituds ar omitted tenses are changed persons or matters are supposed when an occasion is set downe for a cause the euent for the effect the diuel for sinne eternity for a long time
when sinne is meant for sinne it selfe or for a sacrifice or punishment of sinne god for an angell a desire of doing for the deed an act as of seeing for the obiect of feare for the thing or person feared
when lawes are called by names of precepts statutes iustice iudgement testimonies or testame~t
when works of the law of nature or of faith are tearmed only works or faith
when christ is taken for the person of christ the head or for the body of christ the church or

for both
when father is meant essentially for god or personally for the first person only
when by the church is meant the church militant or triumphant the whole body or principal members
when predestination is to glory or to grace
when obduration is actiue by our selues or permissiue by god
when christian liberty is for liberty from sinne or misery fro the law of moyses or christ or from obedience to princes or prelates
all which and many more are difficulties vsuall and controuerted in the scripture both of the old and new testament

this priuate spirit in euery man cannot explicate when the figure is not only in the words but in the matter when one thing is a figure of another as the paschall lambe of christ the red sea of baptisme the ma~na of the eucharist mount sion of the church or when one thing is a figure of many things as ionas of christ and the iewes the rocke of the baptisme of the faithfull and the punishment of the vnfaithfull the flood of noe of baptisme and of damnation
when one and the same thing is a figure in one sense not in an other as the fornicating wife of osee was of the iewes as she sinned in fornication before mariage not as she liued chast after mariage

this spirit cannot explicate in euery one many seeming contradictions as that

the sonne shall not beare the iniquity of the father and

that god doth visit the iniquity of the fathers vpon the children to the third and fourth generation
that

the gifts of god are without repentance and

god repented that he made saul king
that

in the arke was nothing els but two tables of stone and

in the arke were the pitcher of manna the rod of aaron and the tables
that

do not answere a foole according to his folly and

answer a foole according to his folly
that god made not death and

life and death are of god
that

the disciples should take nothing in the way not a rodde and

should take nothing in the way but a rodde
that

if giue testimony of my selfe my testimony is not true and

if do giue testimony of my selfe my testimony is true
that

mary came to the monument when it was yet darke and

she came when the sunne was risen
that

a man is iustified by faith without works and

a man is iustified by works and not by faith
that if did

please men should not be the seruant of christ

and

please al men in all things
that

pauls companions at his conuersion with many others did heare a voice and

did not heare a voice
all which with many more many very learned both ancient as augustine and moderne as diuers interpreters haue with great paines in great volumes laboured to reconcile

this spirit cannot vnfould many bookes chapters and places in scripture most difficult as the first chapter of genesis about the creation of the world the bookes of kings

paralipomenon and the acts of the apostles· about genealogies and reignes of kinges
the prophesy of daniel about the seauenty weekes
of ezechiel about the temple
of iohn in the apocalips about the angels the seales the trumpets the phyals

the dragon the whore and the rest in which saith hierome are as many misteries as words
if one should aske this spirit in euery ordinary protestant how it will explicate and reconcile moyses who according to the hebrew and vulgar edition omits cainam betweene arphaxad sala

and with him
yeares in the genealogy of adam with luke who folowing the greek of the septuaginte doth adde caina

how it will accord the hebrew text which accounts but
yeares from noe to abraham with the septuaginte who account
yeares adding more then the hebrew
yeares almost to euery generation or person
how it will accord the hebrew text which from adam to noe reckons vp but
yeares with the greeke of the septuaginte which reckons vp
yeares somtimes adding somtimes detracting from the former
how it will make an agreement betwixt the history of moyses in genesis and the relation of luke in the acts

in abraha~s departure out of haram moyses

by computation affirming it to haue beene before the death of his father thare for abraham

was
years old when he departed and was borne in the


yeare of his father thare who liued


and so abraham departed out of the land when thare his father was
yeares old that is yeares before he dyed and yet steuen sayth

he departed after thare his fathers death

in the tyme of the

israelites mansion in aegypt moyses by computation affirming it to haue beene but
yeares which paul

confirms accounting from the promise to abraham till the departure out of aegypt but
years that is
before the entra~ce and
after the entrance till their departure and yet luke

and steuen affirme from the entrance till the departure to haue beene

in the number of persons that entred into aegypt with iacob moyses saying that they were but


or


and steuen and luke saying that they were



about the buriall of iacob in this
in the place moyses saying it was in hebron ouer against

mambre and luke and steuen saying it was in

siche

in the seller of the field or sepulcher moyses affirming abraham to haue bought it of ephrem the sonne of

seor and luke and steuen of the sonnes of

hemor which hemor sayth

moyses sold it to iacob not abraham and was according to moyses the father of sichem not as luke and steuen say the sonne of

sichem

in the buyer of the same sepulcher moyses affirming that

iacob luke that abraham bought it of them

in the price of the sayd sepulcher or field moyses affirming iacob to haue bought it for a

lambes or to haue got it by the sword or bow from the

amorrhoites luke and steuen affirming him to haue bought it for siluer

if one should aske how the bookes of the kinges and paralipomenon and the acts can by this spirit be explicated and made agree

in the yeares of saul who
reg
is sayd to haue beene a child of two yeares old when he began to raigne and to haue raigned two yeares and yet
reg
he is sayd before his raigne to haue been higher by the shoulders vpward then any in israell and act
to haue reigned
yeares

about the computation of tyme from the diuision of the land vnder iosue to samuel which according to luke and paul in his speach in the synagogue at antioch act

according to the greeke and protestant edition are
yeares but according to the computation made by raigne of the iudges are but
for
reg
the temple was built
yeares after the departure out of aegypt from

which if there be deduced
from the departure till the diuision of the land and also
of samuel and sauls raigne
of dauids togeather with
of salomons raigne which in all make
as they are collected out of scripture there remaines from the departure out of aegypt till the building of the temple not
years as luke relats but only

about the raigne of ioram king of iuda and ochozias his sonne after him for ioram began to raigne when he was
years old raigned
years which

for his whole life is
yet ochozias his sonne who succeeded him is sayd to haue beene
yeares old when he began to raigne
para
by which he being
yeares old when his father dyed being but
should be two years elder then his father who begat him a question to hierome inexplicable

about the raigne of ioachim or iechonias king of iuda who is sayd
paral
to haue beene but eight yeares old and
reg to haue beene eighteen years old both of them when he began to raigne

about ioram king of israel who is sayd to haue begun his raigne
reg
in the second yeare of ioram king of iuda and yet
reg to haue begun the same in the eighteen yeare of iosaphat who was iorams father and raigned
yeares

about the supputation of tyme as it is counted by the raigne of the kings of iuda and of israel for from the beginning of the kingdome of israel in the first of roboam king of iuda till the end of the same in the sixth of ezechias when samaria was taken are
yeares according to the raigne of the kinges of iuda and yet in the same tyme according to the raigne of the kinges of israel are only
yeares

to all which if we adde the difficult places which according to peter are in the epistles of paul

as for example how are to be interpreted that of
cor
gold siluer hay stubble the day of our lord fire and to be saued by the fire
that of
cor
how to be baptized for the dead
that of hebr
it is impossible for those that fall to repent
if we adde the difficult places which in the euangelists are hard as for example in marke

who cites the prophet esay for malachy
in matthew who cites ieremy for zachary

in luke who adds a generation of cainam to the same cyted by moyses

and makes
generations from dauid to christ

where matthew makes but
in iohn who maks the day of christs passion the day before the festiuall day the rest of the euangelists the day of the feast
if we add the difficult places of which many holy and learned men of ancient time doubted

sent for explication some to august as marcellinus a noble man and martyr volusianus gouernour of rome and paulinus simplicianus euodius and honoratus all bishops
some to hierome as marcella and principia suna and fratella hebidia and algasia noble and religious women as vitalis dardanus euagrius damasus holy and learned bishops
and lastly if we adde all those places which all ancient and moderne heretikes haue in so many articles of fayth abused and corrupted for the establishing of their new inuented heresies if say we adde all these to the former it will by them appeare that the priuate spirit in euery man can be neither a competent nor yet a sufficient meanes to expound and interprete the true certaine sense of scripture neither in places difficult to be vnderstood nor in points necessary to be belieued
and this is the first kind of reason drawne from the nature of scripture against the priuate spirits interpretation of it

svbdiv

by reasons drawne from the priuate spirit which should expound scripture

secondly other reasons are drawne from the nature and condition of the priuate spirit

which whether it be in a priuate person who wants lawfull ordination and authority or in publike doctour pastour or bishop who diuided by heresy or schisme doth not conforme his spirit to the comon spirit of gods church and generall rule of fayth yet that it cannot be a competent iudge of fayth and decider of controuersies is proued by these reasons

first because this priuate spirit is excluded as vnable and vnfit to interprete the scripture and that by scripture it

selfe for peter hauing commended the propheticall word or the wordes of scripture made by the prophets

as being a candle shining in a darke place doth giue this caueat as principally to be vnderstood that the sense of it is not to be made by any priuate interpretation that is though the scripture be a light yet as it is a light not to gentils iewes or infidels who vnderstand it not so it is not a light to heretikes who by the priuate spirit make a priuate interpretatio of it why because by mans will prophesy was not at any tyme brought but the holy men of god spake inspired by the holy ghost that is as the holy men of god the apostles inspired by the holy ghost spake and dictated the word of god when it was made so the interpreters of the same word ought not to bring in any exposition of the same word of god vpon their owne will and sense but vpon the inspiration of the same holy ghost when by them it is interpreted so that we should receaue the sense of scripture from the same spirit from which we receaued the text of scripture
as therefore no priuate spirit but one and the same spirit of the prophets and apostles of christ made the scripture so no priuate spirit

but the common spirit of pastours and prelates of christs church should determine and iudge of the sense of scripture
of which place and others see more in the first chapter

secondly because as truth and faith is not priuate to one

nor singular in any but common to all and generally receaued by all the faithfull for so saith augustine thy truth lord is neither myne nor this mans or that mans

but all mens whom thou callest publickly to the communion of it terribly admonishing vs not to haue it priuate least we be depriued of it for whosoeuer will challenge that as proper to himselfe which is giuen as common to all and will haue that only to himselfe which is for all men that man is driuen from the common to his owne that is from truth to falshood so also the spirit of truth is not priuate to any one but common to all the faithfull for if the spirit of the teacher be not common with the spirit of all teachers it is not a

spirit as it ought to be which is one keeping an vnity of spirit in the bond of

peace making me of one mind in one spirit labouring together for the faith of the

ghospel but it is a spirit of dissentio

which comes in his owne name

speaketh lies of it selfe

leadeth disciples after it selfe and seeketh as a thiefe to kill and destroy


and if the spirit of the hearer be not conformable to the teacher then it is not a spirit of god nor of truth because he who is borne of god heareth the voice of the spirit

and to heare the voice of vs

saith iohn that is of the pastour is a signe to discerne who knows god and who hath the spirit of truth not falshood
but if he on the contrary do follow a stranger

do heare the voice of strangers

do harken to a prophet who ariseth and saith let vs follow strang gods whom thou knowest

not that is new pastours vnknowne who they are or whence they come it is a signe of a spirit which followes not god nor is directed in truth
therfore the spirit of god is not a spirit priuate and singular by it selfe but a spirit common and generall to all the faithfull vniting the sheepheard with the flocke and the flocke with the sheepheard both in the fold of iesus christ in vnity of one spirit and faith

thirdly because this priuate spirit is not only euill but also most vncertaine and fallible for it is vncertaine in whom it is

whether in luther caluin seruetus or rotma and why not as well in bellarmine as in any of them it is vncertaine to him who imagines he hath it whether it be the spirit of god of nature or of sathan and most vncertaine altogeather vnknowne to any but him who challengeth it
it is vncertaine whether that sense it suggests be the certaine meaning of the holy ghost or the inuention of ones owne braine
it is vncertaine whether those interpreters of scriptures which follow it and others who follow them as caluin luther osiander beza or others do expound the scripture in the sense of the holy ghost or of their owne
it could not accord the lutheran deuines of saxony in the conference at altemburge
whether the scripture was to be receiued as interpreted by luther only as the duks deuines of iene lipsia prescribed or as by luther and mela~cthon also as the electours deuines of wittemberge resolued
it could not

agree luther melancthon with zwinglius oecolampadius at marspurge
about the sense of these words hoc est corpus meum whether they are meant properly or figuratiuely
it could not combine in vnity at wormes
the twelue catholicke doctours with the twelue lutheran about many points of controuersy nor the lutheran doctours among themselues of whom seauen the maior part excluded fiue the lesser that is amsdorpius gallus and others the rigid lutherans
it cannot pacify to this day the dissentions about the sense of scripture betweene the lutherans swinglians caluinists vbiquitaries osiandrians swenk feldians trinitarians puritans familists anabaptists and others in number infinite and in contention vnplacable
so vncertaine it is in all so vncertaine it leaues all

fourthly

because it is not only false and vncertaine in expounding the scripture but also it is opposit to the spirit and iudgement of the whole church of all generall councels and of all auncient fathers reiecting and condemning them and preferring it selfe in euery preacher or parochian before them
it will in euery vnlearned protestant

with caluin examine all the spirits of all men· according to the rule of the word of god it selfe say will examine and iudge them
it will with luther affirme and stand to it also

that it will permit none to be iudges but all to be obedient to it
it will with whitaker resolue that all iudgment of fathers councels and church is only humane and only its owne is diuine of which contempt of fathers and councels see the first part chap

fifthly because it is not only false fallible opposite to the spirit of gods church but is the very author and supporter of all heresies as stapleton well notes saying

out of this priuate spirit to which they stand stifly for the exposition of scripture haue issued and flowed all the stincke of heresies and new opinions which haue infected the whole world
and indeed

as euery hereticke diuided himselfe from the church and forsooke the spirit of it so by his new spirit he inuented a new heresy of his owne and sought to draw people after him
all which both concerning heresies rebellions shal in the third part at large be demonstrated

sixtly because all the partes and properties of an infallible iudge are wanting in this spirit as shall appeare in the next chapter
and thus much against the priuat spirits authority of expounding scriptures by reasons drawne from the obscurity fecundity and profundity of scripture and from the falsity fallibility and vncertainty of this spirit

out of which it doth follow first that since the protestants build their saluation only vpon faith and their faith only vpon the scripture and the scripture and the sense of it only vpon the spirit

which is so vncertaine fallible and doubtfull therefore their whole faith and state of saluation is very vncertaine fallible and doubtfull as builded vpon a ground so vncertaine fallible and doubtfull

it followes

that they who in shew rely so much vpon scripture who extoll it so much read it so diligently seeme to be so cunning in it and to build so much on it do not indeed rely build vpon the scripture but vpon their owne spirit or conceit by which they set vpon the scripture what sense they please and draw the sense to what doctrine they please and make the doctrine to serue to what times and turns

to what ends and vses they please

it followes that the catholikes whom the protestantes so much accuse of neglect of scripture do more solidly safely rely on it then the protestants do and do with more security and certainty ground their faith vpon it then they do for the catholikes receiue the scripture as the word of god as much as they more parts of it then they they reuerence it as much as they and haue kept it from corruption longer then they
they ground their faith and beliefe vpon it as strongly as they did the same before it was knowne to them yea deliuered it to them and to many mo besides them
for the true sense and right vnderstanding of it they do not rely vpon euery mans priuate spirit or conceit as they do but vpon the iudgement of the church infallibly assisted by the holy ghost vpon the testimony of the catholike and apostolicke rule of faith vpon the conformity of the auncient practise and obseruation of the church vpon the generall consent of the holy and learned fathers and doctors of auncient time vpon

the infallible decrees of general and oecumenicall councels all of impartiall and authenticall authority which they do not
and by this catholiques are more secure of the true sense of scripture then they haue their faith better grounded vpon the scripture then they and haue their spirit better warranted by god more secured that it is from god and surer combined with the spirit of the auncient catholicke and apostolicke church with the spirit of the holy and learned doctours and saintes of god with the spirit of the generall and receiued councels of gods church none of which they haue
and by this we haue our beliefe grounded vpon a certaine infallible authenticall sense of scripture which they haue not
and thus much of this priuate spirit that it cannot be a fit and certaine rule or meanes truly and infallibly to interprete the holy scripture

the private spirits avthority to iudge controuersies of fayth confuted by reasons drawne from the nature of a iudge of fayth
chap
vi
the properties of a iudge of fayth
sect


thovgh the iudge of the sense of scripture and of controuersies of faith be all one and therfore that which hath beene spoken of the one might also suffice for the other yet because faith extends it selfe larger then the scripture because the true iudge of faith from the false may be the more clearly discerned the functio~s of this priuate spirit may be also more plainly confuted therfore adde in this chaprer these reasons drawne from the office of a iudge of controuersies to shew the insufficiency of this spirit to be a iudge of the
in which

we may note for this iudiciary power and authority

what it is and what properties and conditions it requires

in whome it is and who are to exercise this authority

how it is to be ordered and what rules are to be followed in the exercise of it which being distinctly and fully considered the inability and insufficiency of this spirit to make a iudge of faith will more clearly appeare

first therfore we may note that as in a temporall where contentions arise

offences are committed and tittles are questionable that besides the lawes established there are necessary also iudges to determine causes to decide titles and to punish offences so also in the spirituall of the church where controuersies are of a higher nature questions no fewer in number and the offences more grieuous in quality some personall iudge or iudges are no lesse yea more necessary to discerne verity in all doubts to establish vnity in all contentions and to punish obstinacy in persons who offend
some iudge therfore is necessary as well in spirituall causes as in temporall as well for matters of doctrine as of iustice and as well in pointes of faith as of manners
this iudge because all faithfull belieuers are obliged to belieue

and obey his sentence as true and iust though not in consequences appendixes of faith yet in materiall and substantiall foundatitions of faith though not in schoole questions pulpit conceites which infringe not the solidity of faith yet in maine articles and principall mysteries of faith vpon which is co~posed a complet edifice of true religion though not in probations and allegations for the proofe of pointes of faith yet in the determinations and conclusions of the points or articles themselues though not in case when is intended only to confirme the weake to satisfy the curious or to confound the proud yet in case when is intended to condemne any doctrine as heresy vnder anathema and to declare and define expresly for the common and publicke good of the whole church any verity of doctrine formerly by the practise of the church receaued or by the assent of the faithfull at the least virtually belieued
because say all faithfull are

obliged to belieue and obey this iudge and his sentence in pointes and articles substantiall defined and concluded by sentence definitiue against heresy for the good of the whole church therfore it is necessary that this iudge vpon whome depends the verity of beliefe and the saluation or damnation of so many who by a true or false faith are saued or damned haue these properties or conditions in him in his authority

that he be visible and manifest in person so that he may know and be knowne heare and be heard speake and be spoken vnto and therby haue a publicke court giue publick audience examine publicke causes pronounce publicke sentence betweene parties who contend and in contentions which are debated

that he haue power and authority warrant and commission to giue iudgment pronounce sentence and to compell parties to obedience and performance

that he haue warrant of infallibility in this his sentence that he cannot erre or determine errour deceaue or be deceaued in this his verdit corrupt or be corrupted by partiality in his iudgment
all which are as it were essentially necessary for this iudge for if he be not publicke knowne in person others cannot haue accesse to him nor he vnderstand the causes of others if he be not certaine and infallible in his sentence he cannot determine matters of certainty nor can others be secured by him if he want authority and power to oblige and compell he cannot end the controuersy and establish peace and vnity in the church which is the end of his iudgment

further because this iudge is to haue this infallible authority

and that all are obliged to rely vpon him and his iudgment that he may the more securly proceed in his iudgment and others more confidently rely vpon it therfore he must haue some rule likwise infallible and certaine by which he may be directed in his iudgment and some solid foundation vpon which he may build his definitiue sentence
this rule or foundation because it is to be a rule ground of iudgment and that for persons in number so infinit and for causes in substance so important therfore it can require no lesse then these and such like properties for the

solidity of it and the security of iudgment by it
in respect of it selfe

that it be so certaine infallible that it can neither deceaue or be deceaued

that it be so continued and not interrupted that it cannot decay or perish

that it be so firme and immutable that it cannot be changed or corrupted
in respect of the persons whom it is to direct

that it be so knowne and visible that it may be discerned by all sortes who haue need of it

so markable notable that it may be a signe distinctiue to distinguish true from false beleeuers

so necessary and important that without it no certainty can be had

so vniuersal general that it may satisfy all sortes of people iewes or infidels heretikes or catholikes yong or old vnlearned or learned
in respect of the matter or mysteries which are to be determined

that it be so fundamentall that it be contained among the chief articles of the creed or plainly expressed in scripture

so sufficient that it be able to explicate determine all articles and doubtes in religion

so complet that it containe virtually be able to resolue plainly all questions and conclusions of faith which may at any time vpon any occasion arise
all which are necessary for such a rule and foundation vpon which so important a matter as faith and religion is grounded
and this is the first thing to be obserued for the properties and conditions both of the iudge and his rule of faith

the whole body of the church cannot be this iudge
sect
ii

secondly we may note that this infallible authority to iudge of controuersies of faith is giuen neither to the whole body and congregation of the church of god as the rigid lutherans with brentius do hould· nor to the secular princes and parlamentes as all the lutherans at first and the of england do yet defend nor to the and priuate persons as caluin and the caluinists do maintaine nor yet is it residing in the wordes

and text or scripture as the ordinary preachers pretend but only is giuen to the pastours and prelates of the church of christ who are lawfully by authority from apostolicall succession ordained and catholickly continue without diuision of heresy or schisme in the same and among them principally to the chiefe head and pastour the successor of peter and bishop of rome
all which concerning euery one shall be briefly proued

first therefore although the whole body of the church collected

haue the infallible assistance of the holy ghost that it cannot erre or be deceaued in faith yet hath it not the same assistance that it may ought to be iudge determiner of faith
for as in a naturall body the soule doth informe and giue life to the whole body and euery member of it but doth not discourse and giue vse of reason to the whole or euery part but only to the head so the spirit of god assistes the whole church with the priuiledge of freedome from errour in faith but doth not likewise giue to it the of authority to teach and iudge of faith and direct others in the same for which cause god hath giuen a measure of donation

diuisions of graces and ministrations and made some not al apostles doctours prophets that some may rule others be ruled some teach and others be taught some be superiours to iudge and direct others be inferiours to be iudged and directed and so an order and subordination a peace and vnity may be obserued and kept in the whole body among the members of christs church
whereof see more in the next fourth section

secular princes cannot be this iudge
sect
iii

thirdly that this infallible authority is not in secular princes or their assemblies and parlaments either as particuler members of the church against melancthon or as princes and superiours among the rest against brentius so that they can and may lawfully and infallibly

iudge of controuersies make ecclesiasticall lawes giue authority to preach and prescribe a forme of doctrine a manner of seruice and an order of sacraments and sacrifice though it be largely by many proued against the supremacy of princes in causes ecclesiasticall and requires a treatise more large yet in briefe it shall by these reasons be proued

first

because kinges and princes are in the church of god and spirituall affaires as sheep to be ruled and ordered not as sheepheardes to rule and gouerne they are

lambes to be fed by peter

sheep of the fold of christ members of the church of god and seruants of the family of christ
thus did the ancient and holy fathers freely tell and admonish them and the christian and good emperours themselues acknowledged it
gregory nazianzen

told valentinian that the law of christ did subiect them emperours to his power and tribunall and that they were holy sheep of his holy fold
ambrose

told theodosius the great that he was a sonne of the church and that a good emperour is within not aboue the church
theodoret

sayes of constantine the great that as a louing sonne he did propose busines to the bishops and priests as fathers
constantine himselfe co~fesses that god gaue priests power to iudge of emperours witnesse

ruffinus that they were bishops within the church he without it witnes

eusebius
valentinian the elder confesses that he as a laye man might not interpose himselfe in church affaires but the bishops and priestes had care of such affaires witnes

sozom
and that himselfe was to submit himselfe to them witnes

paulus diaconus
and theodosius the great obeyed ambrose

his excommunication departed out of the chancell at his command and co~fessed that thereby he had learned to know what difference there

was betweene an emperour and a bishop witnes

theodoret and

nicephorus

secondly because the offices of the bishops and emperours are diuers and distinct the one of bodyes and goods the other of soules and fayth the one of life and death for offences against the king and the other of sinnes and sacraments belonging to gods lawes mans conscience the one is temporall of the kingdome and the other is spirituall of the church flocke of christ which the hereticall emperours forgetting were stoutly and zealously admonished and reprehended by the holy bishops vnder them for the same
as for example co~stantius the arian
by hosius

of corduba willing him not to medle with ecclesiasticall affaires nor to commaund them but to learne of them because to him god had committed the empire but to them the church

by

leontius of tripolis because being ruler of military and politicke affaires he should not rule in thinges that belong only to bishops

by

hilary of arles wishing him to writ to iudges of prouincies that they should not presume or vsurpe to intermedle with the causes of clergy men

by

athanasius of alexandria that he and such who will be presidents in ecclesiasticall iudgments who will make the tribunals of the court the seales of deciding ecclesiasticall causes themselues princes and authours of church affaires are the abomination of desolation yea euen antichrist himselfe
valentinian the yonger seduced by his wife was told by

ambrose of milane that he had no imperiall right in thinges that are diuine for

the court doth belong to the emperour but the church to the priest

and being called by the emperour to reason with auxentius the arian he answered that if a conference was to be made of fayth it was to be made by the priestes as it was vnder constantine who prescribed no lawes but gaue free iudgement to priests
that it was neuer heard that in a cause of fayth lay men did iudge of bishops
that if we looke into scripture or ancient tymes bishops vsed to iudge of christian emperours not emperours of bishops
thus ambrose imitating athanasius who sayd when was it euer heard that the iudgement of the church did receaue authority from the emperour many synods and iudgements haue beene yet did neither any bishops persuade any emperour any such thing nor any prince shew himselfe curious in any ecclesiasticall affaires
valens the arian was asked by eulogius the priest in edessa hath the emperour the dignity of priesthood we haue a pastour whome we must obey
anastasius the eutichian was told by gelasius the pope that though he did rule ouer me in earthly things yet he did subiect his necke to the prelates in diuine thinges
thou

knowest that thou oughtest to be ruled nor to rule in order of religion

thou knowest that thou art to depend of this iudgement not they to be brought to thy will
mauritius was admonished by gregory the great that priests are as gods among men therefore ought to be honoured of all kinges
and michael was let vnderstand the same by the nicolas
leo the was told by iohn

damascene that the church ought to be ruled not by lawes of kinges but by the written and not written institutions of ancestours
and to conclude iohn chrysostome sayd freely to his owne deacon if any duke consull or the emperour himselfe come vnworthily represse repell him thou hast greater power then he
where we may note that these emperous were thus by these fathers reprehended for assuming ecclesiasticall iudgment either as heretiks or as tyrants nor yet for doing it alone without the bishops but only and simply as emperours who hauing only temporall power ouer the did assume ecclesiastical ouer the church
which also is further proued by the confession and practise of the best of the christian emperours for constantine the great acknowledged that

the bishops had power to iudge him and when he did iudge of the cause of caecilianus bishop of carthage he did it so that he asked pardon of the bishops for

it
valentinian the elder would haue them to iudge in a cause of fayth and ecclesiasticall order who are not vnlik either in office or title that is priests of

priests
marcians commissioners referred themselues to the councell of calcedon to be taught in fayth and himselfe wills that priests determine what is to be obserued in

religio
and though he himselfe went to the councell

yet it was not to determine but confirme the fayth not prescribing lawes sayth ambrose but leauing the priests free iudgement and making the priests themselues

iudges as he did in the councell of aquileia

theodosius the second sent to the councell of ephesus but not so much as to talke of matters of fayth holding it vnlawfull for those who are not of episcopall order to medle in ecclesiasticall affaires
the same did iustinian in his constitutions and basil in the eight generall councell

thirdly because power not only to preach but much more to iudge of doctrine of fayth for the authority to iudge is

the strong meat of perfect men whose senses are exercised to the discerning of good and euill was committed to bishops as of greater difficulty then the office or preaching giuen to priests and is a spirituall grace or guift giuen by imposition of handes to spirituall men according to that of the apostle neglect

not the grace that is in thee which is giuen thee by prophecy with imposition of the handes of priesthood
therefore as power to minister sacraments is proper to priests so also to iudge of controuersies is proper to bishops lawfully ordained by authority successiuely descending from the apostles
for which cause to priests and prelates not to kings and princes it is sayd thou

shalt seeke the law out of the mouth of the priest
my

wordes shall not depart out of thy mouth and out of the mouth of thy seed and out of the mouth of thy seedes seed for euer


will giue you mouth and wisedome which all your aduersaryes shall not be able to resist
it

is not you that speak but the spirit of my father which speaketh in you
he

that heareth you heareth me
he

that knoweth god heareth vs
he

that is not of god heareth vs not sayth one of the spirituall pastours for which guift caiphas prophesy was a guift of his functio or priesthood according to

augustine though his ill life was the cause of ignora~ce of what he prophesyed

lastly because many inconueniences and absurdities would follow if this authority were annexed to the kingly scepter not to the priestly function for it would follow that fayth could not continue one and the same neither in all persons nor in all tymes nor in all countryes because princes in all tymes and places are of disposition various in iudgement different in faction opposite and in subordination

neither depending one of another nor alwayes respecting religion or religious persons more then may besteed them for their temporall and priuate endes and vses
wherefore as ieroboam of old and queene elizabeth of late

did relinquish the old and introduce a new religion for reasons more politicke then diuine rather to establish their doubtfull titles then religiously to serue god so would kinges by vertue of this their authority if it were in them either in policy or vpon affection be still altering religions and setting vp new most for their owne endes and dispositions by which we should haue as many alterations of religion as of kinges and as many churches as are kingdomes and as great opposition in faith as is in states and
all which may appeare by an example in engla~d where while the authority in iudging in matters of faith was in the prelats religion continued
yeares the same from ethelbert till henry the eight but after that power of iudging was assumed to the scepter by king henry the
the supremacy by one the same king was in three yeares thrice changed from the pope to the clergy from the clergy to the archbishop from the archbishop to the king and afterwards as many religions were a new broght in as kings were a new crowned to wit one by king henry another by king edward a third by queen mary a fourth by queen elizabeth a fifth of puritans would haue been vnder the same queen if power had not preuented it and what may be yet lies in the power of the king and parlament
it would also follow that a man should be obliged alwayes to follow the religion of the king to change with the king and so should not be obliged to be certaine of any or to dy or suffer for any religion but should belieue and preach obserue and practice what the king prescribes and the parlament ordaines all which are against vnity and certainty of al faith and religio
lastly it would follow that for
years after christ whe the emperours were pagan and not christian either pagans must be iudges and deciders of the true sense of scripture and of all controuersies of faith or that there was for that time

no iudge of them at al also when princes become hereticks as constantius and valens did or apostata's as iulian did that either true christians should be obliged to obey and follow pagans apostata's as iudges and vmpiers of their faith or else that they by falling into heresy or apostacy should loose their regall power and authority and subiects should be freed from their duty and obedience to them
none of which our protestants will admit as being indeed too too absurd

the cannet be this iudge
sect iiii

fovrthly that this infallible authority is not in the lay people and priuate persons of the church

is proued

because they want knowledge and vnderstanding to discusse and penetrate either the articles which are belieued or the meanes for which they are to be belieued as being for the most part men simple and vnlearned for which cause they were neuer admitted to any councels as arbitrators or iudges of faith but alwaies directed by their pastours in their obedience to faith

because they haue no warrant or commission giuen them for this end either expressed in any scripture or approued by any tradition or practise of the church or mentioned by any testimony of fathers or councels therfore are not to assume or exercise it till they proue it

because of al sortes they are the most fallible vncertaine and vnconstant in their opinions and practises and therfore are left alwayes to be ruled ordered as the people are in the temporall not to rule and gouerne as magistrates and iudges

because it would follow that all should be iudges pastours to determine none should be subiects to obey or sheepe to be fed that the church gouernment should be democraticall of people which of all is the worst that euery ma should haue a religion of his owne without any vnion with any or subordination to any that the people should preach and minister sacraments as well as priests or prelates should

excommunicate censure and punish one another as well as bishops make decrees for faith and manners as wel as councels
in respect of all which inconueniences and absurdities which are so many testimonies against this authority of the people our sauiour did speake to the people in parables

and without parables he did not speake to them but to the apostles and pastours

he gaue knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen
to the people he spake of things easy and publicke as their sins and vices vertues good life but to the apostles and that separated from the people of his death resurrection the holy ghost the day of iudgment and such like mysteries
with the people he did conuerse before his death not after his resurrection he

manifested not himselfe to all the people but to the apostles as pastours and witnesses preordained of god he appeared after his resurrectio

did eate and drinke with them and commaunded them only not the vulgar sort

to preach to the people
to the people it is said obey

your prelats be subiect to them but to the pastours take

heed to the whole flocke wherin the holy ghost hath placed you bishops to rule the church of god
to the people it is said suffer

the cockle to grow but to the pastours

take away the euil one from among your selues
to the people it is said do

that which they the pastours say but to the pastours he

who heareth you heareth me and he

that knoweth god heareth vs
by of them is knowne which is the spirit of truth which of errour
of the people it is said how shall they belieue him whome they haue not heard how shall they heare without a preacher but of the pastours


how shall they preach vnlesse they be sent all which conuince that our sauiour intended to make the people not pastours but sheep not rulers but subiects not iudges to commaund but seruants to obey in matters of faith and religion

the scripture cannot be this iudge
sect


fiftly that the scripture cannot be this iudge to determyne and end al controuersies is proued

because

this scripture in respect of vs requires a iudge it selfe to determine and assure vs which is true canon true originall text true translation true sense the rest as before therefore to vs it cannot be a iudge

because all or the greatest difficulties all or the maynest questions and all the hoatest contentio~s which haue passed either among catholike doctours or betweene catholicks and hereticks are about the scripture and the sense of it none of which scripture it selfe could euer yet end and decide without some other iudge and vmpier plainly to pronounce sentence in the cause and immediatly vnder punishment to oblige the parties to belieue and obey the sentence

because the scripture is mute dumbe vnable to speake heare or pronounce sentence and is apt not only to be lost alteted and corrupted as de facto it hath beene but also to be drawne wrested and interpreted to contrary senses and opinions by any sort of interpreters in any cause and question as the lamentable practise of so many hundred of heresies hereticks in all ages doth witnesse

because the scripture in it selfe is neither cleare and euident nor doth euidently and expresly containe and declare all the senses of it selfe all the mysteries of beliefe all the questions of controuersies all doubtes in diuinity many things being both now by protestants and catholicks belieued and hauing beene by all faithfull in all ages practised which neither for practise were grou~ded vpo only scripture nor for the doctrine of the are expressed in any scripture

because many haue beene conuerted to faith without any reading or knowledge of scripture many controuersies haue beene decided without any sentence of scripture many faithfull haue liued in the world and beene directed in their faith before any writing of scripture
as for example all in the old law for
yeares before moyses all in the new law for a good time after the sending of the holy ghost dispersion of the apostles and many nations after christ for
years who witnesse irenaeus neuer did see nor heare of the bible and many thousands of saints and soules who did neuer see read heare or vnderstand any scripture at all and yet did liue holily in

earth and do raigne gloriously in heauen

in the scripture are two things

the letter and the sense as the body the soule
the letter according to augustine doth kill that is the externall litterall sense of the words sometimes doth kill cause errour but the spirit that is the true sense which the holy ghost intended

doth quicken auaileth to saluation
but that neither the letter nor the spirit can be a compete~t iudge of controuersies

is proued

not the letter because the letter or the words in the bare literall sense are occasion of errour and heresy for so they were to the iewes who in reading of moyses the law had the veile set ouer their eyes and vnderstood not christ contained and signified in the ceremonies of the law

and so it hath beene to all heretickes who forsaking the sense intended by the holy ghost proposed by the church

and following the letter expounded by their owne spirit haue falsly vnderstood the scripture grosly fallen into errours

thus the letter deceaued sabellius who expounding that of iohn and the father am one of vnity of persons not of substance falsly defended in the deity to be not three but only one person which had three names offices or properties of the father the sonne the holy ghost creating redeeming and sanctifying mankind as the patripassia~s defended the father to haue suffered on the crosse as one and the same person with the sonne
thus the letter deceaued the arrians

who expounding that of iohn the father is greater then of christ absolutly and completely as whole christ not as man according to his humanity did thereupon deny christ to be god equall to the father

thus it deceaued the macedonians who expounding that of paul the spirit searcheth all things euen the profoundites of god concluded not as they ought that the spirit pierceth co~prehendeth all things as god but thus that he who searches doubts who doubts is ignorant who is ignorant is not god and so the holy ghost who searches all is not god

thus it deceaued the manichees who held the old testame~t to be co~trary to the new because for instance the old said that

god created all things that god ceased fro labour

the seuenth day that

man was created according to the image

of god
and the new said the contrary that

the word created all things that

god worketh vntill now and that you

are of your father the diuell
not conceauing according to the spirit and true sense that god created all things by the word as by an idaea that god rested from his worke of creation and yet worketh by conseruation that man was created to the image of god by nature and of the diuell by malice
thus the pelagians denying originall sinne to haue descended from adam to vs literally interpreted that of ezechiel the

sonne shall not beare the iniquity of the father

not only of sonnes who are not partakers but also of sonnes who are partakers of the iniquity of the father as all are of adams sinne in whome

all sinned and who receaued as head the promise of keeping or losing paradise by precept of for bearing or eating the apple for himselfe and his posterity after him
thus it deceaued others who applying literally that of iohn the flesh profiteth nothing some

in the apostles time to the resurrection of the flesh others of late to the reall presence in the sacrament the one therupon denyed the resurrection of all bodies the other the reall presence of christs body both vpon one ground not distinguishing the spirituall from the carnall manner of one and the same body
by which they might as well inferre that the flesh of christ by his incarnation and passion profiteth no more then according to them it doth by his resurrection and manducation
by which proofe of authority and examples it is apparent that the external letter of scripture cannot be iudge of controuersies

that the internall sense of scripture cannot be iudge

is likwise proued because this true sense intended by the holy ghost is often obscure hard and vncertaine as is certaine and before proued
this obscurity breeds controuersies as experience dayly teaches and that these controuersies cannot be ended iudged by is proued

because is the thing in question contention therfore is the thing to be iudged and decided

not the iudge who is to giue iudgment and resolue the parties contending in iudgme~t
as for example a question is about

the sense of those words of the gospel this is my body of those of the creed he descended into hell catholikes vnderstand them as the words import of the reall presence and of the locall descension both of christs body protestants expound them of a figuratiue presence by remembra~ce of him in the sacrament and of an infernall suffering of in his soule vpon the crosse
now of these senses which is true which false the sense of the words cannot iudge betweene catholicks and protestants but some other iudge is necessary to confirme the one and confound the other so to end the controuersy

because many places of scripture are so hard and obscure

as the true sense of them cannot be truly discerned but by church practise and tradition as for example whether those words of mathew teach all nations

baptizing them in the name of the father and of the sonne and of the holy ghost do proue a necessity of the vocall pronuntiation of these wordes for the forme of baptisme as all protestants with vs do grant or require no more but a mentall intention it sufficing only to baptize in the name of iesus as act


doth insinuate
whether those of iohn except a man be borne againe of water and the holy ghost he cannot enter into the kingdome of god inferre a necessity of water for the matter of baptisme as the lutherans with vs grant and the words import or that the water and the holy ghost be all one as caluin expounds
also why the protestants should not inferre as well a precept and necessity of a sacrament of washing of feet out of those words of our sauiour and you

ought to wash one anothers feet after the example of christ who did and commanded it as they do out of those of mathew

eat yee drinke yee inferre a necessity of receauing vnder both kinds because our sauiour did commanded the like
now these and such like require a iudge to iudge of the sense

and reason of them cannot themselues iudge and decide themselues to vs by which is euident that neither the letter nor the sense of scripture can be a competent iudge of all controuersies of faith and scripture

lastly the same is proued by the analogy of a temporal iudge in causes ciuill with an ecclesiasticall iudge in causes

spirituall for as controuersies aryse in ciuill causes the so do they arise also in matters spirituall and the church
as therfore there are customes lawes iudges to decide causes ciuill so there is tradition scripture and a iudge to decide causes spirituall and as customes and lawes are a rule not a iudge to decide the one so also are tradition scripture a rule not a iudge to decide the other
as well therefore is requisite besides scripture some other liuing and speaking iudge in matters of fayth religion to iudge and end the controuersies among christia~s as is necessary besids law some other personal iudge in affaires of the to debate and decide contentions among neighbours
the necessity of both which chiefly appeares when either the parties are contentious and not willing to yield or that the law is obscure and wantes explication or seemes contradictory and requires reconciliation or is penned in tearms generall and stands need of some restriction in causes particuler
all which sith they fall out as well in scripture as in common or ciuill lawes some iudge or iudges are as well necessary to expound scripture as they are to interprete lawes and thereby to end controuersies
and thus is sufficiently proued that neither scripture and the word of god nor princes and kinges gouernours of the nor the lay common people among the faythfull nor yet the whole body and congregation of the church of god can be a fit iudge to pronounce sentence and determine matters of fayth and religion

bishops and prelats of the true church are this iudge
sect
vi

it remaines to proue that this iudiciary power

and authority to heare and examine to decide and determine as a iudge authentical and infallible in matters of fayth belongs only to pastours and prelates of the church and that they hauing receaued lawfull ordination by power successiuely

descending from the apostles by which they enter as sheepheardes not theeues and still remayning in vnity without heresy or schisme by which they continue true pastours not wolues that they say thus ordained and vnited are the only and true iudges of fayth religion
this position as much importing for the certainty of fayth in all persons and mainly confuting the authority of the priuate spirit in euery priuate person is fully to be proued

by the authority of the old testament the practise of the priests in it

by authority of the new testament and the practise of christ and his apostles in it

by authority of the church euer after christ and the practise of all bishops prelates in it

first therefore out of the old testament we haue an expresse law made by god himselfe for this iudiciary authority of priests

in these wordes if thou perceaue that the iudgment with thee be hard and doubtfull betweene blood and blood cause and cause leprosy and not leprosy and thou see that the wordes of the iudges within thy gates do vary aryse and go vp to the place which our lord thy god shall choose thou shalt come to the priests of the leuiticall stocke and to the iudge that shall be at that tyme and thou shalt aske of them· who shall shew thee the truth of the iudgment and thou shalt doe whatsoeuer they that are presidents of the place which our lord shall choose shall say and teach thee according to his law and thou shalt follow their sentence neither shalt thou decline to the right hand nor to the left hand but he that shal be proud refusing to obey the commandment of the priest which at that tyme ministreth to our lord thy god· and the decree of the iudge that man shall dye
in which wordes
the priests haue authority and commission to iudge of all causes

the people are willed to go to them for iudgment in doubtfull causes

vnder paine of death they are commau~ded to stand too obey their iudgment without appeale to any higher court of prince or other

in which we may note
the institution and beginning of this authority of the priests in the old law

the progresse and continuance of it

the end and cessation of it

the institution of it

was for all cases of the law of commandment of ceremonies of iustifications that

is of the law morall of the ten commandments ceremoniall of seruing god and iudicial of gouerning the people though in this place be mentioned only two causes that is of blood and leprosy
these causes were determined in two courts or councells the one greater at hierusalem called synedrion consisting of the high priest as chiefe and
with him as assistantes in which greater causes were iudged and appeales from the lower councell were admitted and this was by god himselfe

instituted
the other lesser in euery citty consisting of
persons who had the hearing and determining of smaller causes and was by moyses

at the aduice of iethro his father in law instituted
by these two councells were all causes iudged of these the priests were presidents and iudges and of the greater the high priest for the tyme was supreme iudge whose sente~ce in all causes

and vnder paine of death all were obliged to obey

the continuance of this law and doth appeare

by the facts of some of the kinges chiefly of

iosaphat king of iuda which repaired this councel being decayed and made amarias the high priest president for those things which belonged to god and zabadias for the office of the kinges

by the wordes of the prophets especially of malachy who sends the people to the priests

to require the law from his mouth because he is the angell of the lord of hoasts
of aggaeus who bids them

aske the priests law
and of the wiseman who

wils his sonne to seeke no further because the words of wisemen are as prickes and as nailes deeply stricken in which by the councel of maisters are giue of one pastour
therfore this sentence is the last iudgme~t which admits no appeale

the end cessation of this law

and tribunall of moyses doth appeare by the beginning of a new tribunal of christ
for as with the death of christ the obligation of the law the sacrifices of the law and the prophesies vnder the law ceased and the verity of them being in his passion fullfilled so also the iudiciary power both of the priest and of the law diminished as the greater power of the new christ increased
and the assistance of the holy ghost by degrees failed them and their councell as by

degrees the power of christ was more plainely manifested the grace of the holy ghost more abundantly bestowed of which out of scripture we haue this proofe

and experiment whereas the high priest with the priests scribes and gathered three councells in the life of christ all about the person of christ
in his infancy at the co~ming of the to consult where he was borne whe herod would haue killed him
before his passion after the raysing of lazarus

to aduise about his apprehension when caiphas vpon malice aduised his death and as priest prophesyed of the iewes saluation by his

death
at his passion when by false witnes they condemned him as guilty of death and thereupon procured his

death in the first the holy ghost fully assisted them and their councell that their determination was both true and iust in the second the holy ghost assisted in part the high priest in that his verdict of the iewes saluation by one which verdict proceeded from the guift of prophesy annexed to his priestly function and in part forsooke him in that is was iniust for that he did vpon malice condemne him in the third the holy ghost quite forsooke them both in verity of the sentence as falsely accusing christ of blasphemies and in the iustice of the same as wrongfully condemning him to be worthy of death
by which is declared how farre the priests iudiciary power before christ did extend it selfe how long it did endure in what manner by degrees it did cease and end out of all is conuinced that neither prince people or priuate person but the priest in that tyme had power to decide and iudge all controuersies of the law of fayth

secondly this authority of priests and prelates is proued out of the new testament

and that two wayes

by the commission authority which our sauiour gaue to the apostles and by their practise of it

by the same commission giuen to the same apostles not only for themselues and their owne tyme but also for their successours and all tymes ages
that our sauiour gaue this iudiciary power to his apostles and to them only is proued
by the authority and commission he gaue to peter as the head


by the same which he gaue to the rest as the principall me~bers and directours of the church vnder this head

to peter as head he first promised it the he prayed to confirme him in it

he promised it in that he promised to make him the foundation of the church by giuing him the title of a rocke saying vpon this rocke will build my church for what a maister is in a house what a gouernour is in a citty what a king is in a kingdome and what a head is in a body the same is a foundatio in a building peter in the church therefore to peter was heere promised to be the head the foundation and the gouernour of his church

in that he promised to make him the gouernour of the church in a representatiue manner giuing him keyes of it

to thee will giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen
for as the deliuering vp the keyes of the citty to any is a signe of giuing vp the charge and gouernement of it to him so the promise of giuing to peter the keyes of the kingdome of heauen was a promise of giuing power authority to gouerne as a iudge the kingdome of heauen that is his church

in that he gaue him power to bind and loose that is to retaine or remit by way of absoluing or not absoluing to commaund and punish by way of dispensation censure sentence or iudgement not only persons whomesoeuer but also causes whatsoeuer whether of crimes and offences against lawes or in doctrine and opinion against fayth
and so the promise was made
to the person of peter

of authority to be iudge and gouernour

in all causes of doctrine or offe~ces whatsoeuer

christ prayed to his father for confirmation of this authority vpon peter prayed for thee

that thy fayth faile not and thou once conuerted confirme thy brethren that is that he might be firme in his fayth and thereby with his power confirme and settle others in the same

out of which lucius felix marcus leo agatho paschalis popes with bernard after them cited by bellarmine doe gather the infallibility of peter and the popes power in iudgment of fayth
lastly christ inuested peter in this authority and iurisdiction when he gaue him commission and charge to feed his sheep feed my sheep feed my lambes

in

which he gaue authority to peter singularly as to one who he calls simon the sonne of iohanna and from whome in particuler he drawes before hand a triple confession of his singular loue to him aboue the rest
he giues also him authority to feed that is to exercise all pastorall charge and function which requires
that he feed with spirituall food all his sheep within the fold of his holy church according to ezechiel

are not the flocks fed of the pastours and psalm

our lord doth gouerne me in greeke feed me nothing shalbe wa~ting to me he hath placed me there in a place of pasture

that he cure the sheep that are sore gather those who are dispersed reduce them that wander and defend those who are assaulted by the wolues

according to that of ezechiel and my sheep were dispersed because there was no pastour and they came to be deuoured of the beastes of the field and were dispersed
my flockes haue wandered in all mountaines and in euery high hill
that which was lost will seeke

that which was cast away will bring againe and that which was broken will bind vp and that which was weake will strengthen and that which was fat and stronge will feed them in iudgment

that he rule gouerne discerne iudge and chastise according to that of scripture thou

shalt feed that is gouerne my people israel and be captaine ouer israel
thou

shalt rule them in an iron rod
behould

iudge betweene beast and beast of rams and of bucke goates betweene

the fat beast and the leane
out of which is apparent
that our sauiour gaue to peter in these wordes feed my sheep a pastorall charge ouer al his sheep that is all christians who are the sheep of christ

that this pastorall charge consists in collecting curing directing defending and iudging these sheep of christ

that peter by this charge had power to preach minister sacraments correct offenders and iudge of all doctrine as chiefe head and gouernour in the church of christ
and so it is conuinced that this iudiciary authority was giuen to peter as head of the rest

that the same was giuen also to the rest of the apostles is proued because as christ did communicate to his apostles power and authority which was proper to himselfe to

forgiue sinnes vvhose

sinnes you forgiue in earth shalbe forgiuen in heauen and to offer sacrifice

do this so also to the same did he communicate these priuiledges proper to himselfe that as he was maister of all one

is your maister christ so also he made them maisters not

only of infants but also

of nations that they should

teach all nations
as he was light of men so

they should be the light of the world
as he gaue

testimony to the truth so

they should giue testimony and be witnesses of him to the end of the earth
that

as the father did sanctify him so

he prayed to his father to sanctify them
as

he was sent by his father into the world so he sent them
as by a voice from heauen it was sayd of him

heare him so by his owne mouth he sayd of them

he that heareth you heareth me
the apostles therefore were appointed for maisters specially sanctifyed made the light of the world ordained witnesses of his truth sent with authority and commission as himselfe was for that end that they should be heard and obeyed as himselfe was and the same power they receaued from him not only themselues challenged and practised after him and with him but also their successours after them and with them
for as christ was giuen

a light of the nations so they sayth luke· were

also the light of the nations
as

the spirit of god was on him to euangelize to the poore so god chose them sayth luke that

the gentils by their mouth should heare the word of the ghospell and belieue
as

he did reconcile the world to himselfe so he sayth paul placed

in them the word of reconciliation
as he came an embassadour from his father to

be a messenger of iudgment to the world so sayth paul we

are legates for christ
as our sauiour sayd of himselfe he

that is god doth heare the wordes of god therefore you heare not because you are not of god so doth iohn say of them· he

that knoweth god heareth vs and he that is not of god heareth vs not
therefore as christ thought it no robbery to be equal to his father in diuinity so they thought it no iniury to him to be in some sort participant with him in his power and authority

and that christ gaue this authority to the apostles not

only for themselues and their owne time but also for their successors

and for all ages so that it is to reside and remaine in the pastours and prelates of holy church their successors continually till the end of the world is euident for if he haue this authority as necessary for the peace and gouernement of his church and if the church stand as great need of it in all ages as in that time of the apostles as it is certaine it doth then without doubt it was as well giuen to the pastours of the future tymes of the church as to them of the present for which end christ sayth paul gaue

some apostles some prophets some euangelists some pastours and doctours and for what end for

the consummation or perfection of saints that is of all faythfull for the worke of the ministery to teach his truth for the edification and propagation of his body to conserue and increase his church for

the vnity of fayth vntill all concurre in one least

men be wauering and vncertaine in faith like little ones least they be carryed with euery wind of doctrine least they be circumuented by craftines in errour
all which dangers as they remaine in all tymes so the remedy prepared against them must remaine for all tymes
whereupon peter did not only himselfe exercise this authority but at his departure gaue the same to the pastours of pontus galatia and bythinia to whome he writ his epistles willing them to

feed the flocke of god which is among them
paul did not only practise it himselfe but also left it to the pastors of ephesus

to rule the church of god
to titus to

ordaine priests through all citties in creet as he had disposed
to timothy to

commend to faithfull men what he had heard of him and willed the conuerted iewes to

obey their gouernours· and be subiect to them because they watch as being to giue an account of their soules
whereupon not of the apostles only but of all pastours and only of pastours it is sayd

my spirit which is in thee and my wordes which haue put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed fro this present for euer
what is this word my

spirit which is in thee but to compare the prophesy and the performance the paraclete the spirit of truth which the father will giue to you what are the wordes in thy

mouth but the wordes and vnderstanding

which thou father gauest to me gaue to them and they receaued of me what is thy seed and seeds seed but those who are to

belieue by their word in me what is from this tyme for euer but that

will be with you euen to the consummation of the world and so doth the prediction of the prophet concurre with the performance of our sauiour
to all pastours and only of pastours it is sayd sonnes

are borne to thee for thy fathers and thou shalt make them princes ouer all the earth that is according to augustine for apostles thou shalt haue prelates
to al pastours and only to pastours it is sayd he

that heares you heares me
and he

that knowes god heares vs and he that is not of god heares vs not
that is sayth cyprian all

gouernours who by subordination succeed the apostles
because sayth augustin in

the chaire of vnity he hath placed the doctrine of verity
of al and to all pastours it is sayd how

shall they preach except they be sent no

man assumes to himself honour but he that is called of god as aaron
to all and only of pastours it is sayd if

he heare not the church let him be to thee as the heathen and publican that is sayth

chrysostome and theophilact if he heare not the pastours of the church
and if he be worthy to be esteemed so who despises them that admonish him of his fault much more worthy is he to be deemed so who despises him who instructs him in fayth
to all and only pastours it is sayd that

the gates of hell shall not preuaile against the church
in so much that all the promises of and perpetuity in fayth co~sists chiefly in this infallible authority of the pastours who are to instruct in fayth direct in fayth and to iudge of fayth and what promises are made to the church are made chiefly to the pastours as the principall partes of it and by the to the rest as inferiour
to them therefore is giuen the

word of reconciliation the

dispensation of the mysteries the

function of embassages the

testimony of truth to all nations
they are the fathers who beget spirituall children by the preaching of the word who nourish them with the food of the sacraments who rule them by good lawes and discipline and who defend them with their spirituall power

authority
they only haue the

keyes of the house of dauid which they shall open and none shut
the

keyes of the kingdome of heauen against which shall not preuaile and the

kingly priesthood
all because in and by their priestly function and authority christ doth forgiue sinnes doth reconcile to him the world doth make lawes doth exercise his power and establish his kingdome of heauen and doth

raigne in the house of iacob for euer
and thus is the iudiciary authority of the church in the pastours and prelates of it lawfully ordained and peaceably vnited proued by the testimony of holy scripture

the same is further proued by the practise of the church in all tymes and ages for when any controuersy did arise any new opinion did start vp or any practise was doubtful and questioned the decision and iudgment was referred neither to the whole body of all belieuers nor to the princes kinges and emperours the chiefe protectours of the church not to the the greatest number in the church not to the scripture written word only which is a rule not properly a iudge in the church but to the chiefe pastours and prelates the directours gouernours of the church

who collected togeather in some councell either prouinciall which sufficed in cases where the cause was either not important or other could not be collected or generall which was gathered when the cause was great the aduersaries potent and the assembling conuenient had the hearing examining and iudging of the cause referred to them and did censure the persons and put a finall determination to the cause question
thus we read that the question about the obseruation of legall ceremonies was determined in the councell of the apostles at hierusalem

the controuersy about the obseruation of easter on the
day as the iewes vsed or the sunday after as is now by christians vsed was by diuers councels decided as at rome vnder pope victor at hierusalem vnder narcissus in france vnder irenaeus in pontus vnder palma at corinth vnder bachillus and lastly at nice vnder pope syluester
thus was the nouatians and their sect denying pennance and absolution

to them who failed in persecution condemned by the prelates and bishops of italy at rome of france at arles and of africke at carthage
thus was sabellius and his heresy

denying the trinity of persons condemned by the prelates of aegypt at alexandria
the donatists and their schisme

denying the validity of baptisme ministred by heretikes co~demned at rome arles and carthage and other places by the bishops of the same countryes
paulus samosetanus

and his errour affirming christ to be pure man was condemned by the bishops of asia in two synodes at antioch
thus were the manicheans condemned at ancyra the archontickes at neocaesaria eustachius at gangra in armenia priscillianus at toledo in spaine pelagius in palestina melitum carthage constantinople
and macedonius apollinaris photinus sabellius eunomius at rome berengarius at vercells and rome luther and his fellowes at ments treuers and colen in germany and macline cambray and other places in the
all which and many more were censured and iudged by the bishops called in synodes prouinciall

in like manner by the prelates collected in generall councells

were censured and iudged the causes of greater heresies and contentions as that of arius in the first cou~cell of nice and the diuinity of christ defended

that of macedonius in the second generall at constantinople

and the deity of the holy ghost confirmed
that of nestorius in the third generall at ephesus and the vnity of one diuine person in christ decreed
that of eutiches

in the fourth generall councell of chalcedon and the verity of two natures in christ concluded
that of peter and seuerus of antioch

petrus of apamea cyrus of edessa anthymius acatius of consta~tinople in the fifth generall at constantinople

and their persons with origens errours condemned
that of cyrus of alexandria sergius pyrrhus and paulus of constantinople and their monothelite heresy of one will in christ

in the sixth generall at constantinople condemned and the two wills in christ determined
that of leo and copronymus emperours and the with them in the seauenth at nice censured and the worship of images defended

that of

photius and the deniers of the procession of the holy ghost from the sonne

in the eight generall at constantinople reiected and ignatius the patriarch confirmed
all which were in the greeke church
in the latin and west church bishops also proceeded

and iudged in the generall councels as in the ninth and tenth generall at lateran against the sarazens

and vnder calixtus ii and innocent ii
in the eleuenth and twelfth also of lateran against the waldenses and ioachim the abbot vnder alexander the iii and innocent iii

in the thirtenth fourtenth of lyons against fredericke the emperour and the errour of the greeks vnder innocent iv

and gregory the
in the fifteenth at vienna against the begards and others vnder clement the
in the sixteenth at florence against the greeks vnder eugenius the iv

in the seauenteenth at lateran vnder leo the against schismatikes
and lastly in the last at trent vnder paul iii
iulius the iii

and pius the iv against the lutherans all heretikes of late
in all which and others examination was made and iudgment giuen not by princes or the whole body of the cleargy but only by bishops and prelates the chiefe pastours of the church who only and not the former were as appeares by authority of scripture and the continued practise of the church the true authenticall and infallible iudges of controuersies of fayth and religion

the priuate spirit cannot be this iudge
sect
vii

it remaynes to proue that this infallible and authenticall authority to iudge of controuersies of fayth neither doth

nor can reside in euery particuler faythfull person nor that the priuate spirit of euery one which is heer intended can be a competent iudge of all controuersies of religion
this is conuinced by diuers proofes drawne from diuers heades
the first proofe is drawne from the former reasons which disproue this authority to reside either in princes or in the or the whole community of all faythfull

belieuers for all the reasons which proue against them and their spirit proue much more against euery priuate person and this spirit in particuler

the second proofe is drawne from the former reasons which proue this authority to be communicated only to the prelates and chiefe pastours of the church for if the spirit of god for this end be giuen only to them as it was to moyses to iudge the people then it was not for the same end giuen to all and euery one of the common people and euery ordinary faythfull person among them

the third proofe is drawne from the essentiall partes of an authenticall and infallible iudge because in this spirit are to be found neither ability to know persons nor authority to iudge causes nor infallibility to pronounce a certaine sentence and iudgment
first therefore this spirit cannot know and examine the state and disposition

the cause and question of the person who is to be iudged neither can the person who is to be iudged know that this spirit remaynes in him who is to iudge or that authority by it is giuen to iudge
for this spirit say they who chalenge it is knowne that it is the spirit of god only to them who haue it how then shall it be knowne to others who are to be iudged by it how shall the people know the spirit of the pastour that they may be directed by it or the pastour know the spirit of the people that he may direct the how shall any conuersation in discipline of good life any communication in doctrine of fayth any subordination in obedience to lawes be obserued among these person vncertaine one of anothers spirit and authority by it how shall the sentence of absolution vpon the faythfull or of conde~nation vpon the faythlesse be iustly denounced how shall the doctrine of truth be preached or the doctrine of falshood be confuted and the people obliged to belieue the one and to forsake the other how shall iustice be ordered obedience obserued authority maintained lawes executed and penalties inflicted where neither the inferiour can know the spirit of the superiour vpon which spirit his authority dependes nor yet the superiour can any way force or compell

the spirit of the inferiour who yet will chalenge an equality of preheminence and priuiledge of the spirit with him

secondly this spirit cannot challenge to it selfe any such power or authority or shew any authenticall warrant from god

that it is the spirit of god either in scripture tradition or practise of the church all which before do reiect and condemne it
it cannot exercise any function which belonges to this authority as to censure or absolue to oblige or vnity to punish or reward any fault co~mitted or person committing it
it cannot with equality of tryall heare or examine the cause nor denounce and pronounce any sentence which can oblige
it cannot admonish threaten terrify and enioyne any punishment by the rodde of iustice
it cannot compell correct and punish any by way of exteriour iustice or enforce the one party to yield subscribe and submit to the sentence of iustice
it cannot bridle in the hand of the one the fury of iniustice or deliuer to the handes of the other the right of iustice
it cannot conuince the one of his errour against truth nor secure the other of his possession of truth
it cannot compell the one to cease from wronge or giue redresse to the other in his wrong
what power hath the spirit of one man to threaten to command to correct or punish the spirit of another what authority can one spirit alleadge which another cannot as well challenge what prerogatiue of spirit can the pastour assume of which the spirit of the people may not as well presume vpon what priuiledge can any superiour stand vpon which and the same any inferiour may not or will not as well insist the inferiour can as co~fidently assure himselfe as certainly auouch and as resolutly resolue himselfe that he hath receaued the

spirit of the sonne of god dwelling in him
that he hath the

spirit of his sonne abiding in his heart by which he cryeth abbae father
that

god hath giuen him also the pledge of the spirit the

spirit of adoption vvhich

doth giue testimony of his spirit
that

his spirit doth search all thinges yea the profundities of god
that

his spirit doth try all thinges yea prophesyes doth

try all spirits

if they be of god and that he is

a spirituall man doth iudge of all thinges and himselfe is to be iudged of no man because he hath the sense of christ and knoweth the sense of our lord that may instruct him
where is then the authority of the pastour ouer a flocke endewed with this spirit or the power of the superiour to correct a people full of this spirit how shall the one compell to obey and the other haue the liberty of the spirit not to obey what order or subordination what discipline gouernement can be established among such spirits or men ruled and directed by such spirits

thirdly this priuate spirit cannot giue any certainty

or infallibility of the verity of his iudgment for it cannot assure and secure any that it is a spirit of god not sathan of light not darknesse of truth not falshood of a true not a false prophet
it cannot assure secure any that his iudgment for example of predestination iustification certainty of saluation of only fayth is not a presumption and illusion and rather hereticall then catholike doctrine
it cannot assure and secure others either that the spirit is true or that the iudgement of it is vpright or that the doctrine of it is true all sectes and heresies whether caluinist or lutheran rigid or milder whether protestant or puritan whether brownist or familist whether anabaptist or arian whether swenkfeldian or libertine challeng it for the certainty of their doctrine as true are taught and directed by it as true and yet some or all of them must needes be false as being contrary euery one to another euery one condemning another and all condemned by the authority of gods church and by the spirit of god instructing and assisting it
by all which it is apparent that the priuate spirit wanting visibility to be knowne authority to iudge and infallibility to secure cannot be an authenticall iudge of controuersies of fayth

fourthly

the fourth reason against this priuate spirits infallible authority to iudge of fayth is drawne from the properties of a rule foundation of fayth before assigned all which are wanting in it
for first it wants the promise of any certainty and infallibility it hath no promise

or

warra~t in scripture that it is the pillar

and ground of truth· the

house the temple the kingdome of christ that hell gates shal not preuaile against it that

he who heareth it heareth christ who

contemneth it contemneth christ and

who obeys it not is as the heathen and publican that

it shall remayne with euery man shall teach euery man all truth and instruct euery man in all which christ shall speake to him
all which yet are promised to the holy church and the spirit of god in it

secondly it wants continuance and duration for as it is a priuate spirit in euery one and can continue no longer then the person in whome it is and with whome it begins and ends

liues and dyes so it hath no promise of scripture to endure from age to age· from generation to generation from saboth to saboth

as long as the sunne and moone shall endure till the end of the world to the seed and seeds seed for all generations
all which are yet promised to holy church and the spirit of god in it

thirdly it wants immutability and freedome from alteration or change for as we see it changes in euery place tyme

and person yea as often as the moone breeding as hilary sayd of the arians a monthly yearly fayth and as one of them confesses what to day they hould you know but what to morrow

neither you nor they can know in what head of religion do they agree who oppugne the bishop of rome if you examine all from the head to the foot you shall almost find nothing affirmed by one which another will not auerre to be wicked the deuines do dayly differ from themselues coyning a monthly fayth
thus it changes in all doctrines and in opinions of scripture some affirming this part to be scripture which others deny some inuenting one sense and others a contrary and it so alters from sect to sect from heresy to heresy from catholike to lutheran from this to caluinisme from that to anabaptisme from thence to arianisme and so on to iudaisme turcisme and atheisme
and as this alteration de facto workes in protestants so also it hath no promise of constancy that it is

a rocke a

pillar a foundation as

the sunne before god as sure as

the day and the night that it hath

an euerlasting couenant which shall stand for euer and for

an eternall glory and not be giuen ouer
all which is yet promised to the church and the spirit of god in it

fourthly it wants visibility

and publike manifestation to vs not only that it is the spirit of god of which before but much more in whom it remaines for as that which is in one cannot manifest it selfe to another so others cannot manifestly know that it is in any one
aske for example the lutherans who follow luther and his spirit the caluinists who follow caluin and his spirit the anabaptistes who follow rotman and his spirit the who follow seruetus and his spirit the libertines who follow quintinus and his spirit or any precisian who follow a precise preacher and his spirit how they know that luther doth enioy this spirit more then caluin or caluin more then rotman or rotman more then seruetus or seruetus more then quintinus or any one of them more then the pope and catholike church vnder him they can giue no reason more for one then for another shew no cause why they follow one spirit more then another or why they should be persuaded confirmed directed to the fayth of any one more then another
this spirit therefore hath not the conspicuity and visibility of being

as a tabernacle in the sunne

the sunne in my light

a candle vpon a candlesticke or

seauen candlestickes in the temple a

citty vpon a hill

a mountaine in the top of mountaines eleuated aboue the little hills that it may be seene and knowne of all the world
all which yet are agreable to the catholike church and the spirit of god in it

fifthly this spirit wants combination or connexion by which it may combine all faithfull in one bond of vnity and concord

and so distinguish a true church from a false a right belieuing catholike from a deceitfull heretike and a right way to heauen from an erroneous path to perdition
it is priuate and particuler in euery man diuerse and contrary in most men
it did suggest of old one beliefe for example in sabellius another in marcion another in nestorius another in apollinaris and eutiches and it hath suggested of late one in luther another in zuinglius a third in

caluin a fourth in munzer a fifth in seruetus and aboue
in this last age in so many new maisters and founders of new sects

all whose hartes are diuided and

like the aegyptians run togeather against the aegyptians and

by diuision make the kingdome of christ desolate
and yet all of them call this their spirit of the lord all build their beliefe vpon it all are directed by it in their contrary doctrine and beliefe
aske any one or all of them how they are instructed who they follow by what they are directed all answere by this spirit all appeale to this priuate spirit and yet all want that spirit which

keepeth vnity of the spirit in the body of peace

which should continue them in one minde

in one agreement and iudgement

in one hart and soule in one way and path

and make them all one as christ was one in his father
which spirit notwithstanding resides and dwels in the catholike church

sixthly this spirit wants vniuersality as vnable to resolue all doubts and questions which arise

either about scripture in the obscurity profundity and multiplicity of senses or in the seeming contradictions figuratiue locutions and seuerall interpretations of the wordes the various texts and reading the many of yeares in numbring the different translation of words from the originall or which arise about the mysteries belieued as the vnity of the the trinity of persons in the blessed trinity the person the natures the wills the body the soule of christ the nature of grace sinne iustification sacraments church prayer to saints for the dead purgatory and thousands such like which this spirit could neuer decide and end either in tymes ancient or of late but with contention it begunne all these differences in contention it proceeded in them and neuer ceased till by contention it consumed it selfe and ended them
it cannot sufficiently conuince any one either pagan or infidell either turke or iew either heretike or obstinate person that they are in errour and haue not the spirit of god as well as true christians
it cannot conuert reduce or confirme any to the verity of true fayth who is either ignorant of fayth or

staggering in his fayth or obstinate against faith
it can giue no probable reasons of persuasion propose no credible testimonies of inducement deliuer no conuincing arguments of certainty of fayth and doctrine and in effect can shew no grounds sufficient in prudence to persuade any iudicious man to accept as credible the religion of christia~s more then of iewes turkes or pagans therefore it cannot extend it selfe to all nations

enlarge the place of his tents stretch out the skins of his tabernacles

increase the sea with knowledge

sucke the milke of gentils and be nursed with the tette of kings

it cannot conuert the multitude of iles

bring in the riches of the gentills

preach pennance and remission of sinnes

from hierusalem to the vttermost of the earth

from north to south from sabaoth to sabaoth

from the ends of the earth
all which yet as they were promised to holy church so are they performed in it and by the spirit of god in it

seauenthly this spirit wanteth all warrant and commission from god either expressed in holy scripture or mentioned in the creed of the apostles or deliuered by any tradition or defined by any councell or contained in any rule of fayth or deduced out of any principle of religion or confirmed by any practise of antiquity that all men must rely on it be ruled by it and be obedient to it for the certainty of their fayth and religion we find no preheminence or prerogatiue attributed to it that it is either

the kingdome

the citty

the inheritance

the house

the temple

the spouse or

the body of christ which yet the church of god by his spirit in it hath
we read of no authority it hath either

to bind or loose sinnes

or to offer sacrifice or to minister sacraments or to instruct in all truth

to teach all nations or to punish offenders with the rodde of correction of censure of excommunication giuing vp to sathan which yet the church of god by his spirit hath
we haue no expresse warrant or commaund to do

what it shall say to vs do to heare and obey it as christ himselfe and that

vnder paine of despising christ

of being an ethnicke and publican

and of damnation
all which yet we haue of the church of christ and of the spirit of god

dwelling in it and directing it
all which properties and conditions since they ought to be in a rule iudge of faith as is before shewed and are all and euery one wanting in this protestant priuate spirit as is heere manifest it remaines euident that for these reasons it cannot be a sufficient or competent iudge of all controuersies of fayth and religion

the protestant private spirits avthority to iudge of controuersies of fayth confuted by reasons drawne from the nature and certainty of fayth
chap
vii
the properties of fayth with the priuate spirits manner of proceeding
sect

this priuate spirits authority to expound scripture and to resolue questions of fayth we haue confuted by reasons drawne from the nature of an infallible both interpreter of scripture and iudge of fayth
it remaines that we co~fute the same by reasons drawne fro the nature and infallible certainty of fayth of which this spirit is assigned by the protesta~ts to be a principall if not a sole and whole meanes or instrument to cause it

for which we may note that the protestants doe


ground their saluation vpon only fayth which say they doth only iustify

they ground this their fayth vpon only scripture

which according to the containes al things necessary to be belieued

they ground this their scripture and the sense of it only vpon the priuate spirit by which alone excluding all authority of tradition or fathers they expound the scripture so that the priuate spirit is to them the principall or sole ground of their sense of scripture their the principal or sole ground of their fayth this their fayth the principal or sole ground of their saluation
what certainty therefore they haue of scripture fayth or saluation dependes vpon the certainty they haue of this their spirit which if it faile and proue not to be true and of god but deceitfull and of sathan then failes with it the truth of their sense of scripture the truth of their fayth and religion and the truth of their hope or certainty of saluation
whereupon it followes
that they can haue no more certainty of their fayth and saluation then they haue of this their spirit which is the ground of their fayth and saluation

that what conditions or properties are required to certainty of fayth the same are required in this spirit which is to them the prime mayne in effect the sole meanes or grounds of faith

that if we demonstrate that the properties and conditions which are necessary to fayth are wanting in this priuate spirit then we conuince that this priuate spirit cannot be either a sufficient ground wheron to build faith or a competent iudge wherby to determine controuersies of fayth

which being supposed let vs examine these properties of faith

what and how many they be and applying them to the priuat spirit shew that they are all euery one wanting in it

therfore this diuine and supernaturall faith as it is necessary to saluation for according to paul without

faith it is impossible to please god
and according to augustine it is certaine that none can come to true happinesse except he please god

and hat none can please god but by faith for faith is the foundation of all good things faith is the beginning of mans saluation

without faith none can come to the fellowship of the children of god because without it neither in this world doth any man obtaine the grace of iustification nether in the next shal he possesse eternall life so also it must necessarily haue these properties or conditions that is it must be one certaine entire and catholike faith manifested by diuine reuelation by apostolicall mission and preaching confirmed by miraculous operations and made credible by conuincing testimonies of credibility
all which as they are peculiar to true faith either connexed to it or concurring with it so are they all wanting to this priuate spirit and haue no affinity or similitude with it as in particuler shalbe shewed

the priuate spirit cannot be a meane of vnity in fayth
sect
ii

therefore fayth is one witnes paul one lord one baptisme one fayth witnes leo

except it be one it is not fayth
witnes irenaeus

all belieuing in one and like manner all points all teaching deliuering in one and the same manner all thinges and all hauing one soule and one hart which though it differ in language yet is the same in tradition
one say in all persons both in the materiall obiect because the same articles of fayth are belieued by all and also in the formall obiect because for the same motiue and in the same manner they are belieued by all in all places tymes
which one fayth as one soule in many partes of the body doth make one church in all the partes of the world

but that this priuate spirit neither is nor can be one in all who claime and challeng it as neither inclining and mouing them all to belieue either one and the same thing or in one and the same manner or for one and the same motiue nor yet combining them in any vnity either of one and the same church or of one and the same discipline

or gouernment or of one and the same scripture and sense of it is apparent and proued

first because this spirit is priuate proper and peculiar

in euery one without subordination to any without connexion with any or without dependance vpon any
it is singular and seuerall in euery one hauing a kind of operation which is for the manner singular for the motiue different and for the effect opposit in euery one
it wanteth one and the same either authority of god for warrant or reuelation from god for motiue or proposition by church for surety or direction of one visible head for gouernment as a linke and combination of all the spirits in one vnity either of sacraments seruice or ceremonies or of faith discipline and exposition of scripture
wherupon it withdraweth al men from the high way of vnity diuerts them into of diuision

conducts them into the downfall of schisme and heresy and so precipitates them headlong into a gulfe of infidelity and perdition


because as experience teaches vs it hath hatched all the viperous sects schismes and heresies which this last age in such aboundance brought forth into the world
it vpon the first breathing of the new ghospell deuided the followers of it into lutherans

sacramentarians anabaptists and subdeuided the lutherans againe into the zealous the ciuill and the disorderly lutherans and subdeuided yet againe the zealous into
the ciuill into
and the disorderly into

subfactions and petty heresies
it subdeuided the anabaptists into
seuerall factions and the sacramentaries into so many new opinions in seuerall countries inuented by so many seuerall new maisters as that within the space of an
years fewer some as gualter reckon vp
others as rescius
others as hedio a protesta~t within
yeares after luther
all inuented and nourished by this spirit
and for multiplicity of scripture senses it deuised as one
yeares ago collected no fewer then
and as another since hath obserued no fewer then
seuerall expositions all out of foure wordes hoc est corpus meum
which dissention and diuision was euen in caluins time so memorable and markable that he himselfe confesses that this age hath brought forth horrible monstrous sects so that many staggering and knowing which to follow haue cast

away all care of any religion at all
by which is apparent that this scripture neither doth nor can beget any vnity or concord in fayth and religion and so cannot be a fit instrument to beget and conserue fayth

that it cannot be a meanes of certainty of fayth
sect
iii

secondly fayth must be certaine

and infallible to vs more certaine sayth chrysostome are we of things we see not then of thinges we see
yea so certaine as that it admits no deliberate and voluntary doubt not only actuall

but not so much as possible
for as fayth is an inward assent of the mind which we giue to that which god who is the prime verity and can neither deceaue

nor be deceaued hath reuealed to vs by meanes of the preaching and teaching of the true church so our assent must be as certaine as is the verity of god vpon which it dependes that is so certaine that it admit no more deliberate doubt

incertainty or fallibility then doth the word of god vpon which it depends
which certainty of fayth because luther caluin and zuinglius extend to euery mans particuler saluation they consequently affirme that euery man must be as certaine of his saluation as he is certaine there is a god that he can no more loose his saluation then christ can loose it

but that no such certainty can be in this priuate spirit proue besides that which is in the former chapter shewed by these reasons
first because no certaine and infallible rule or ground can be giuen certainly and infallibly to know that this spirit in any man is a spirit of truth not of errour of light not of darknes of god not of sathan or not humane therfore there is no reason why any should build vpon it as certaine

secondly because that they who admit a certainty of it admit it only in the persons who haue it

not in others who follow them who haue it wherupon all who follow

the spirit and doctrine of any other whosoeuer as the co~mon both people and preachers do follow that which to them is fallible and vncertaine and so build vpon a ground fallible and vncertaine

thirdly because experience conuinces that this spirit hath deceaued doth daily deceaue many for whatsoeuer either sense of scripture or doctrine of faith or certainty of saluation the spirit of one man doth certainly assure him as true the spirit of another man doth as certainly assure him that the same is false as for example the spirit of zuinglius oecolampadius· caluin and other sacramentaries assures them that the sense of hoc est corpus meum is figuratiue that the body of christ is not really and corporally present in the sacrament and that they in this faith are infallibly sure of their saluation but the spirit of luther assures him that the sense of the words is literall that christs substance is really and corporally present with the substance of bread and that the sacramentaries are heretiks and damned who hould the contrary
the like doth the spirit of the anabaptists libertines and others assure them of other such places against both lutherans and caluinists
and the spirit of the arians assures them of the like against all the former
and all this is wrought by this spirit all conceauing a certainty in it yet all opposit and condemning one another by it
what certainty therfore can there be in any of these spirits what infallibility more in luther then in caluin what in caluin more then in rotman what in rotman more then in seruetus or what in any one of them more then in any other sectary what can any one claime or challenge for the certainty of his spirit which the other cannot as infallibly claime and challenge for the certainty of his euery one of these assure themselues that their spirit is of god
euery one of them all are certaine of their sense of scripture of their faith and of their saluation by it yet euery one defends a contrary faith inuents a contrary sense of scripture condemns the contrary part of heresy is certaine by his spirit of the others damnation as the other conceaue themselues certaine of their owne saluatio
what certainty

therfore can there be amongst so opposit certainties surely none but to be certaine that all of these spirits are most vncertaine and fallible yea wicked and damnable that the state of all who depend of them is pittifull and miserable

that it cannot be meanes of the integrity and perfection of faith sect
iiii

thirdly faith as it is one and certaine

so it must be entire and catholicke that is the doctrine of it must both in all points be wholy and entirely belieued also by all persons be vniuersally and catholikly professed
it must be in all and euery point completely belieued because euery point by god reuealed and by the church proposed to vs is of equall verity certainty and necessity of beliefe
therefore as the keeping of all the commandme~ts doth oblige all and the breaking of any one is a transgression of the law so the belieuing of all articles of faith either actually and expresly as the learned doe or virtually and implicite as the vnlearned do who expresly belieuing the principall and most necessary to be expresly knowne do in not doubting or oppugning the rest virtually belieue al the rest in that they belieue them as the church doth teach them doth in like manner oblige all and the voluntary doubting or misbelieuing of any one is an heresy against fayth and doth violate the integrity which should be in fayth of which the fundamentall reason is because all articles of fayth are belieued for one and the same infallible motiue and reason that is for the reuelation of god made knowne by infallible proposition of the church of which whosoeuer denies the authority in one point infringes the infallibility of the same in all points for if the reuelation of god or proposition of church may faile in one it may faile in all so can giue no certainty of any out of which followes that an heretikes who obstinatly misbelieues one article reuealed and proposed is intensiuè no lesse

an infidell that is as destitute of any diuine fayth as is pagan who belieues not any one christian article at all because what he belieues in any he belieues not vpon a right true and solid motiue of beliefe that is the reuelation of god and proposition by church which if he did he would for the same belieue also the rest

it must likewise be catholikly and vniuersally belieued

that is what was by the first faythfull the apostles others in the first ages belieued must also be by the succeeding faythfull in the next ages likewise belieued and what is in most places and countryes and hath been by the most faythfull in most countryes generally belieued the same must also by others likewise faythfull in other countryes be generally belieued
by which catholik beliefe of the same doctrine in all or the most places persons and tymes is made one catholike church among all persons in all places and all tymes

but that this protestant priuate spirit cannot produce any such one

and the same fayth either entire and whole in euery point or catholicke and generall in all persons places and tymes that it cannot incline all persons in all tymes and places to belieue all points of one entire catholike fayth is proued
first because it is neither one in all persons neither hath any lincke or combination of any vnity to combine in one all persons as neither proposing to all persons all articles of fayth by one the same motiue nor combining all persons dispersed in tyme and place in one lincke of one fayth for it is singular seuerall priuate and proper in euery one without any subordination or connexion among any as is apparent by the former insta~ces of luther zuinglius caluin rotman osiander illyricus quintinus seruetus blandrata and others who all as so many ruptures out of one riuer hauing broke the bankes of catholike vnity did at seuerall tymes and places diuide themselues into seuerall currents of opposition and runne al a course contrary one to another without meanes or hope of euer meeting or reuniting againe

secondly because it is a spirit of separation diuision

and disunion in that whomesoeuer it possesses it doth separate them as disioynted members from the vnion of gods holy church the spouse and body of christ and doth diuide and cut them into seuerall peeces and mammocks of sects schismes and heresyes
for as euery one receaues a new part or portion of this new spirit he chooses to himselfe a new opinion of doctrine labours to erect and set vp a new conuenticle of new belieuers and makes himselfe the head or follower of a new sect or heresy and so all or heretikes who in all ages from christ downewardes haue separated themselues from his church and erected a new fayth and synagogue haue had their origen and beginning from this spirit haue made their progresse and proceeding by this spirit and haue ended themselues and their dolefull and desperate presumption in the obstinacy of this spirit
in all which the scope and marke they aymed at was thereby to free themselues from all order and subiection thereby to arrogate to themselues all authority and dominion thereby to exercise what liberty they best affected and to belieue and teach what doctrine they most fancied and best fitted their conceit humour

thirdly because this spirit is inuisible insensible inperceptible and vnable to be knowne or vnderstood as they graunt by others or any saue only they who imagine they are possessed with it
and as it is inuisible and vnknowne so it is composed of an inuisible and vnknowne company meeting in inuisible and vnknowne congregations ministring inuisible and vnknowne sacraments making an inuisible and vnknowne church consisting of inuisible and vnknowne both pastors who preached and people who heard the doctrine of it for many ages togeather of which they can assigne neither tyme when nor place where nor people who were taught by them can produce no acts or monuments no recordes or registers either of people who belieued professed this their faith or of princes who did honour and defend it or of persecutours who did oppose and persecute it or of any men women or children who were baptized and liued or dyed in

it
they can nominate no citty or country no priest or prelate no prince or potentate no confessour or martyr who belieued professed honoured and defended in paper or pulpit by word or sword the fayth of this spirit and why because the directour is a spirit inuisible which compasseth a church of persons insensible who preach a doctrine incredible and performe actions not memorable
all which is nothing els but an inuinsible argument of an impossible fiction inuented in the idle braines of spirits to disguise the nouelty of a new new deuised religion
and this is all the integrity or vniuersality of fayth that this priuate spirit can effect or affoard

that it cannot be a meanes of fayth which is got by hearing
sect


fovrtly this faith which is thus one and certaine thus entire and catholicke is also ordinarily by one and the same way and meanes imparted vnto vs that is by hearing this hearing proceeds from preaching this preaching is deriued fro mission

according to that of paul how shal they belieue him whom they haue not heard how shall they heare without a preacher how shall they preach except they be sent so that faith it by hearing hearing is by preaching of pastours and preaching is by mission from the authority of superiours
of which the reason is because faith is an argume~t or proofe of things that do not appeare either to our sense or reason but are aboue our vnderstanding and capacity therfore we cannot attaine to it by euidence of reason but by credit of authority
to this authority that we may giue credit we must conceaue and heare it this hearing that we may be obliged to accept it must by be proposed and preached to vs and this preaching that it may the better secure vs of it must be from lawfull mission by ordinary succession deriued and so lawfull mission from apostolical authority infallible preaching or proposition of pastours and a pious disposition in vs to heare and belieue

what is thus proposed are the meanes by which according to paul true faith is attained

but this priuat spirit quite ouerthrowes all this excelle~t order and subordination ordayned by christ iesus

proposed to vs by the holy ghost
for first it alone without any disposition of hearing without any proposition or preaching of church pastours without any authority of apostolicall mission and ordination teaches and directs in particuler euery one man woman or child which is true scripture which is true sense of it and which is true doctrine collected out of it therfore euery one thus made faithfull by this spirit stands need neither of disposition to heare what is to be belieued nor of preaching to belieue what they heare nor of mission and ordination to secure them of what is preached because this spirit supplies the effect of all both ordination proposition and disposition of hearing therfore all order and discipline all subordination and subiection all sacraments or preaching are needlesse yea fruitlesse in gods church
as this spirit secures alone so without sacraments it sanctifies alone
as it instructs all in faith so it corrects all in errours against faith· and as it is directed by none but god so it is subordinate to none but god alone obliged to none obedient to none it is immediate as they which haue it imagine from god it wil be subiect only to god it will be directed only by god it alone inspires all what they are to belieue alone works all what they are to do and alone secures all that they cannot faile of their end and saluation and so alone to all is all in all that is the beginning progresse and end of all grace and goodnesse
thus is the spirit to them if you will credit them

secondly it alone hath warrant and commission power and authority in whomsoeuer it is whether he be yonge or old simple or wise vnlearned or learned secular or spirituall to examine censure to giue sentence and iudgment in any cause or controuersy ouer any pastour or prelate vpon any councell or church particuler or generall present or past late or auncient
for as caluin

and kemnitius for example by the prerogatiue of this their spirit tooke vpon them to censure and correct by their examine and antidote not only the late generall councel of trent but also the auncient generall councels of nice constantinople chalcedon and ephesus yea the whole church of god and all doctours in it for many ages togeather as is before shewed so euery ghospeller who hath got but a tast of this spirit and can but read the scripture in english will by the same prerogatiue of this spirit assume to himselfe the same authority to examine the same examiners to censure the same censurers and to iudge the spirit of the former iudges yea to examine censure and iudge all pastours doctours fathers councells and churches and to determine which of them haue erred what sense of scripture is to be preferred and what fayth and religion is to be imbraced
all which as these new protestant maisters first practised vpon the ancient fathers so these their new discipls haue learned to practise the same vpon them their maisters and do as well censure them as they did their predecessours and that worthily for what they taught and practised against their fathers is a iust punishment that their children should learne and practise the same against them

that it cannot be a meanes of fayth which requirs credible testimonies
sect
vi

fifthly this fayth as it is obtained by piously hearing the infallible preaching of pastours lawfully ordained and sent

so also it requires besides diuine reuelation reasons and motiues of credibility forcible to moue the vnderstanding to accept as probable this doctrine of fayth thus by preaching proposed and by god reuealed for as before he that giueth credit quickly

is light of hart
and reasons of credibility such as are miracles sanctity vnity conuersions of nations

and such like before mentioned doe make a true fayth more credible according to that of dauid thy testimonies are made too credible

but that this priuate spirit cannot giue any such credible testimonies

or produce any probable motiue to conuince any one that it is a true spirit of god or a certaine meanes of faith is proued because it cannot alledge any consent of people and nations nor any authority of miracles to vse augustines words nourished by hope increased by charity and confirmed by antiquity

such as confirmed augustine in his faith it cannot alleadge any vnity which it causeth either with the head christ or with his body the church not any sanctity which it worketh by works memorable for piety or miraculous for power and vertue not any consent of vniuersality by which it hath been imbraced in all places at all times by all nations and persons no not in ancient time by any persons renowned for holinesse and learning not any succession of pastours prelates doctours or saints who haue relied themselues their faith saluation vpon it it cannot produce any one euident either authority of holy scripture or any one tradition of apostolicall time or any one practise of auncient church or any one decree of generall councels or any one testimony of learned doctours or any one probable much lesse conuincing argument of reason that either all or any one man must or may settle his beliefe in it interprete the scripture by it rely his saluation vpon it deduce all resolutions of fayth all questions of controuersies all doubts of religion from it and giue peremptory iudgment and sentence of all pastours and prelates of all saints and doctours of all churches and councells of all doctrine and religion according to the suggestion of it which yet the precise protesta~ts do both in doctrine professe and in practise performe

that it cannot be a meanes of fayth which obliges all to belieue and accept it
sect
vii

sixthly fatyh to whome it is by god reuealed by church proposed and by credible testimonyes conuinced

obligeth them to accept it

and to giue credit and testimony to it to be directed and ordered by it and to submit their iudgement in obedience of fayth vnto it according to that of paul bringing into

captiuity all vnderstanding vnto the obedience of christ and

as children of obedience

receauing grace for obedience to the fayth
whereupon it is sayd

he that doth not belieue shalbe condemned
because when it is sufficiently deliuered declared what we are to belieue and do they who by negligence do not imbrace and follow it are inexcusable and so deserue damnation
and as they who are obliged to attaine to the end are obliged to vse apply the meanes necessary for that end without which the end cannot be attained so because we catholikes for our part do hould a pious disposition to heare that which is authentically preached and proposed by pastours lawfully ordained and because the protestants for their part do hold the motion and suggestion of the priuate spirit to be a necessary meanes for the attaining vnto fayth it followes that as the one is bound to giue audience and obedience to al preaching of pastours lawfully sent and proposition of church defining what is to be belieued and practised so the other is bound to heare and obey euery motion and suggestion of this their priuate spirit speaking in them and inspiring them what to do and belieue

but that this spirit cannot vnder any precept naturall or diuine oblige any one much lesse all men to accept credit and rely vpon it and to make it their rule and foundation their iudge and vmpier the assurer and securer of their their fayth their religion and their saluatio as it is of it selfe more euident so by these reasons it is confirmed

first because as it is often before touched no man hath any certaine meanes or ground wheron to build a certaine resolution of the certainty either of this spirit or of euery motion of it that it is of god not of nature or sathan

because no such precept is intimated in any scripture tradition councel or

because it would follow that men should be obliged to belieue and follow

spirits contrary and motions of them contrary and so senses of scripture contrary fayths and religions contrary and opinions of saluation contrary for as luther had one spirit and one motion of it caluin another spirit and a contrary motion of it osiander a third spirit and an opposit motion of it so like manner swenkfeldius rotman seruetus quintinus moore hacket and an hundred more sectaryes had euery one of them distinct spirits and contrary motions of them in the sense of scripture which they expounded in the articles of their fayth which they belieued and in the certainty of their saluation vpon which they presumed so euery one being obliged to belieue and follow their owne spirit the motion of it in the fayth and saluation diuers should be obliged to belieue and follow contrary spirits and contrary motions of contrary spirits and so contrary senses of scripture contrary faithes and religions and contrary certainty of saluation which is as absurd as in religion absurd may be
also because as the wind blowes so the spirit moues sometymes one way sometymes another sometymes to this thing sometymes to to the contrary suggesting now one meaning of scripture now another now one fayth then another and sometymes doubts of all faith and suggests no fayth at all often dispaires of all grace and leaues no hope of assurance of any saluation at all it would likewise follow that men should be obliged sometimes to belieue no fayth at all sometymes to dispaire of all grace goodnes and saluation and sometymes to haue as deep a conceit of their damnation as other tymes they haue of their saluation
whereby still following a wauering spirit and tottering motions of it they should wauer and totter betweene vncertaintyes and contrarietyes and remaine alwayes vncertaine in themselues and contrary to others and so be like cloudes without water carryed with euery ayre like waues of the sea tossed with euery wind foaming out their owne confusion like wandering stars

to whome a storme of darkenesse is reserued for euer
and thus much of reasons drawne from the nature and properties of fayth which may suffice to conuince that this priuate

spirit and the motion of it are so farre from being any necessary meanes of fayth and religion that they cannot so much as consist with any but are opposite to all true fayth and religion

the private spirits avthority to iudge of fayth confuted by circular absurdities which follow thereupon in the groundes of their fayth
chap
viii
of the nature of a circle and the differences of circles
sect
nothing doth make more to a plaine vnderstanding the absurdity of this priuate spirit then the absurdities which doe follow vpon it against both faith reason
these absurdities are of two sortes
the one circular inuoluing an absurd manner of proofe proceeding by way of a circle condemned by all principles of philosophy and diuinity
the other doctrinall as we may tearme them inferring a doctrine absurd and dissonant from all principles of fayth piety and reason
in this chapter we will shew the circular absurdities in the next the doctrinall which doe follow vpon this priuate spirit and the protestants doctrine taught by it

for the circular absurdities we may note

of a circle

what a circle and a circular proofe is

the difference betweene a circular proofe lawfull

vnlawfull
therby iudge and make an estimate of the catholike and protestant mutuall obiection the one against the other in this kind
first therefore aristotle in his demonstrations hauing proued that in euery demonstration we must come to some principles or propositions imediatly knowne of themselues

and not demonstrable by another medium or proposition disproues two sortes of philosophers the one affirming that there can be no demonstration of any thing at all the other contrariwise affirming that there may be demonstrations of euery thing eue of the first principles or propositions which by a circular demonstration say they may be demonstrated by the conclusion as the conclusion is demonstrated by the premises admitting therby a circular demonstration of the conclusion by the premises and of the premises againe by the conclusion
this latter errour of circular proofe he co~futes by three reasons

because it would be petitio principij

or the begging of the question which as before in his former bookes of resolution he resolued was when the medium or proposition prouing any thing is either the same which is to be proued or more obscure or as obscure or knowne after the thing to be proued
all which inconueniences this circular manner of probation doth inferre making the probation either the same or equally or more obscure then the thing to be proued

because it would follow that idem should be prius posterius notius ignotius respectu eiusdem knowne vnknowne first knowne and after knowne in respect of the same
as when the premises do demonstrate the conclusion they must be first and better knowne then the
and againe· when the conclusion doth demonstrate the premises it should be first and better knowne then the premises so the same conclusion shalbe prius notius as demonstrating the premises and posterius ignotius as demonstrated and proued by the premises both being vnderstood of the same premises

because this circular proofe is to proue the same to be the same because it is the same as the conclusion to be true if

it be true or because it is true
as saith aristotle si a est est si est a est ergo si a est a est
in which as a is proued to be a because it is a so the conclusion is proued to be true because it is true
whereupon aristotle concludes that euery circular proofe and demonstration which is regressus ab eodem ad omnino idem that is when we returne fro one thing to the same thing againe and from one proofe to the same proofe againe is vitious and vnlawfull in logicke
and thus much of the nature of a circle

secondly for the difference betweene a proper circle

which is bad and an improper which is good and lawfull we may note also that euery kind of circular and reciprocall proofe is not vnlawfull for some is reciprocall betweene the cause and the effect as betweene rationale and risibile betweene the sunne the day
and thus may be proued the effect by the cause priori as est risibile quia est rationale est dies quia sol lucet or on the contrary the cause by the effect posteriori as est rationale quia est risibile or sol lucet quia est dies
other proofes are reciprocall betweene two causes of diuers kindes as betweene the efficient cause and the finall in which sense we proue phisicke to be good because as the efficient cause it causeth and worketh health and health to be good because as the finall cause or end it moueth to take phisicke
or betweene the efficient and materiall cause as when we proue the entrance of the wind to be the cause that is efficient of opening the window and the opening of the window to be the cause that is materiall of the entrance of the wind
or when we proue the aboundance of raine by the aboundance of vapours as by the materiall cause and the aboundance of vapours by the aboundance of raine as by the effect
all which kind of reciprocall or circular proofe of the cause by the effect and the effect by the cause or of one cause by another is good and allowed in logicke as being improperly a circle
only that which is disallowed and by aristotle all condemned is that proper manner of circle which is
when in the same kind of cause one thing is proued by another and this againe by the former which is either

idem per idem or ignotum per ignotius

when this reciprocall proofe is made by one and the same cause in one and the same manner of proofe

when to one and the selfe same person this one thing is thus proued by another and this againe by the former the one mutually prouing the other as when the premises demonstrate the conclusion and the conclusion againe the premises both being otherwise vnknowne
as when the maister proues the seruant to be innocent and the seruant the maister both being before suspected as guilty
in which the same thing is notius ignotius prius posterius that is more knowne and lesse knowne first knowne and after knowne both in one and the same respect and in respect of one and the same person and so a thing vnknowne is proued by another more vnknowne which is that vnlawfull circle or circular manner of demonstration disallowed and condemned by aristotle
by which is manifest what a circular proofe is and of circular manners of proofes which is improper lawfull and which proper and vnlawfull

thirdly both catholicks and protestantes do mutually accuse one another of this vicious and circular arguing and manner of proofe
the protestants accuse the catholicks because they proue the authority of the scripture by the authority of the church and the authority of the church by the authority of scripture
for aske a catholicke how he knowes the scripture to be infallible and true he will answer because the church tels him it is so aske him how he proues the church to be infallible and true he wil answer because the scripture sayes it is so and so he proues the scripture by the church and the church by the scripture
the catholicks accuse the protestants because they proue the scripture by the spirit and the spirit by the scripture for aske a protestant how he knowes the scripture to be true and the true sense of it he answers because the spirit so tels and assures him aske him how he knowes the spirit that it is of god and speakes truth he answers because the scripture tels and assures him so and so he knowes the scripture by the spirit and the spirit by the scripture

the catholikes cleared from the obiected circle against their doctrine
sect
ii

the question therefore is whether the catholiks betweene scripture and church

or the protestants betweene the scripture and the spirit and otherwise do fall into this kind of vitious argumentation and proofe in ma~ner of a circle
and that the catholikes are free from this fault and do make their proofe to seuerall sortes of persons in seuerall kinds of causes by a partiall manner of proofe and thereby do still proue one thing vnknowne by another more knowne to those persons is first to be proued

for which we may note that the catholikes require to fayth for so much as is for our purpose two thinges

first a preparation to prepare vs to accept the thinges belieued as credible and in prudence worthy to be belieued which is wrought by credible testimonyes such as are miracles consent sanctity antiquity and the rest before me~tioned by which our vnderstanding is euidently conuinced to iudge and accept of the christian religion as more worthy or credit then any other
secondly they require a firme assent or beliefe to the articles of fayth proposed as true and of infallible verity which is wrought by the habit of fayth and dependes vpon the diuine reuelation of god declaring in scripture or tradition and proposing by holy church what and why we are to belieue vpon which reuelation thus proposed we settle our last resolution of fayth and the certainty of it as vpon the former credible motiues or humane fayth we setled our preparation or acceptation of fayth and the credibility of it
now if we compare or apply these togeather it will euidently appeare that in neither is committed any circle because the former that is the acceptation depends vpon credible motiues which are as the samaritan womans word making it seeme probable that christ was the messias and the later that is the assent to fayth dependes diuine reuelation which is as our

sauiours word reuealing to them that he is the true messias and so both haue seuerall grounds and principles on which they depend the one credible testimonies the other diuine reuelation wherby comparing them togeather no appearance of any circular proofe can be found betweene them

for the actuall assent and beliefe it selfe whereby we infallibly belieue the mysteries reuealed though we belieue the verity of scripture reuelations by the authority of church proposition and church proposition for the authority of scripture reuelation whereby scripture reuelation doth giue vs testimony of church proposition and againe church proposition of scripture reuelation yet that this reciprocall testimony and proofe is not any proper and vitious circle is proued
first because it is in diuerso genere causa

in diuers kinds of causes which before out of aristotle is admitted for good and lawfull for the testimonyes of scripture reuelation to the infallibility of church proposition is causall as a cause

and that formall why we belieue and assent to church proposition
but church proposition is only conditionall as conditio sine quae non to know scripture reuelation and so they are reciprocall in a different manner of proofe the one that is scripture priori as including diuine reuelation the other that is church posteriori required only as a condition
the former as a formall precedent cause the latter as a subsequent annexed condition
both of them not much vnlike to our sauiours testimony of iohn baptist and to iohns testimony of our sauiour the one as of god and infallible the other as of an holy man credible or to the testimony of our sauiour the woman to the samaritans the one as giuing certainty the other as proposing credibility of his being the messias or to the former example of rationale and risibile of the and the day of the vapours and raine of the opening the window and the entring of the wind
all which reciprocally proue one another as the cause and the effect or as seuerall causes
and all which doe much resemble the testimony of scripture to the church and of the church to the scripture which is likewise in a seuerall kind of causality

and a different manner of probation

secondly because this reciprocall proofe is not ad omnino idem as aristotle requires to a proper circle that is

the one is not the totall and sole cause of knowing the other
for church proposition is not knowne only by scripture reuelation and no other way but also by other proofes signes and credible testimonies conuincing that church authority is necessary and infallible to distinguish true sense of scripture from false and to end controuersies about scripture
and therefore as aristotle admits that though the premises haue proued the conclusion yet the conclusion may againe proue the premises that in eodem genere causae so that the conclusion be proued by another medium then by the premises
so though the scripture reuelation proue church proposition yet church proposition may againe reciprocally proue scripture reuelation so it be knowne by another meanes as we see it is then only by scripture reuelation for this according to aristotle is only an improper circle and not a bad and vnlawfull circle

thirdly because this reciprocall proofe is not to one the same person who is ignorant or doubtful of both but to diuers persons and such as suppose the one
for to a catholike who admits as belieued church propositio we proue by it or reuelation and so an vnknowne thing to him by another thing supposed and knowne to him but to a protestant who admits as by him belieued scripture reuelation we proue by it church proposition so to him a thing vnknowne by another more knowne
but to a pagan who admits neither scripture reuelation nor church proposition we proue neither of them one by another but both the one and the other by other probable motiues and credible testimonies more agreeable to his natural capacity and by them persuade him first to accept as credible church proposition and by it scripture reuelation by which scripture and church or scripture expounded by church we persuade him to assent and belieue the articles reuealed
in all which we proue ignotum per notius the vnknowne by the more knowne to him and so preparing him

to giue credit to one do by that induce him to belieue the other
by which meanes we still proceed from a thing knowne to an vnknowne to that person and so auoyd the circle and begging of the question into which the protestants runne and there sticke fast
in which note the difference betweene them and vs for they proue reciprocally and circularly the scripture by the spirit and the spirit againe by scripture in the same kind of proofe to wit formally as shalbe shewed we proue scripture by church and church by scripture in diuers kindes of cause to wit the one causall and the other conditionall as is shewed

they proue the one by the other no otherwise knowne then by the other as the scripture by the spirit which spirit is only and by no other meanes knowne then by scripture and contra as shalbe shewed but we haue more means to know the church then by scripture as is shewed

they proue one by the other to the same person to wit the protestant doubtfull of both we to diuers persons who suppose belieue the one so ad hominem by that we proue the other
al which as it is true as presently shalbe shewed so it shewes an apparent difference between the protestant circular ma~ner of proofe of scripture by spirit and of spirit by scripture and of our catholike improper circle and lawfull manner of proofe of scripture by church and of church by scripture
and thus much to cleare the imputation layd vpon catholikes for their circular manner of proceeding in their proofe of scripture by the church and of church by scripture

the protestants diuers manners of circles
sect
iii
svbdiv
the circle betweene the scripture and the spirit

it remaynes to shew that the protestants doe seuerall wayes fall into this vnlawfull circular manner of probation

for which we may note how the protestants for their doctrine of fayth iustification and saluation

do make this gradation concatenation of one point with another
the first ground of all they make gods free and irrespectiue election or predestination of some to his grace and saluation his like reiection condemnation of others to damnation


to these elect and only to them god giues true fayth and certaine assurance of their saluation

to these faythfull only to them he giues the infallible assistance of this his priuate spirit

to this spirit and only to it he giues the true and certaine vnderstanding of the holy scipture the sense of it
so that
election
fayth
the spirit
vnderstanding of scripture is as a chaine of many lincks whereof all are so connected euery one with another as he that hath one hath all and he that wantes one wantes all
for say they the vnderstanding of scripture is giuen only to them and to all them who haue the spirit the spirit is giuen only to them and to all them who haue fayth fayth is giuen only to them and to all them who are elect and so all and only the elect are faithfull all and only the faithfull haue the spirit all· and only they that haue the spirit vnderstand scripture
and so primo ad vltimum all o~ly the elect must haue true fayth spirit and vnderstanding of scripture
in which election is the mother and foundation the vndersta~ding of scripture the fruit top of al their perfection
this is the connexion of their doctrine concerning their faith and saluation
now as co~cerning the knowledge infallible assurance of all these which according to their groundes euery one of them must haue of himselfe to wit that he is elect faithfull and hath the true spirit of god the right vnderstanding of scripture as concerning say the assurance of all these and the meanes of this assurance whereupon depends their saluation if any shall demand of them whereupon they ground this their certainty and assurance of all these that is their election fayth spirit which are inseparable and infallibly according to them ensuing one vpon another it will appeare by their answere that they haue no groundes at all but that

they runne in a round and circle rowling and wheeling from one ground or principle to another and from that to the former backe againe without any firme or setled grou~d and resolution whereon to stay themselues and their fayth whereupon they skip forward and backward from one to another that is from the scripture to the spirit and from the spirit to the scripture againe from the spirit to fayth from faith to the spirit againe from faith to election and from election to fayth againe and so from election to scripture againe and from scripture to election backe againe
for aske a protestant how and by what meanes he vnderstands the scripture he answers by the spirit
and aske him how and by what meanes he knowes that he hath the true spirit he answers by scripture
and so knowes the scripture by the spirit and the spirit by scripture
againe aske him how and by what meanes he is assured of his faith he answers by his spirit and scripture but how is he sure of his spirit and scripture by his fayth backe againe
further aske him how and by what meanes he is assured of his election he answers by his fayth his spirit or the scripture and yet his election is the ground of his fayth spirit and vnderstanding of scripture
so that
the scripture proues the spirit and the spirit the scripture

the spirit proues his fayth and his fayth the spirit

his faith proues his election and his election is the ground of his fayth with it of his spirit and knowledge of scripture also
so that as many linckes as are in their chaine so many circles and circular proofes are made by them and all in vaine and to no purpose at all as shall be shewed

and first of their first circular proofe betweene the scripture and the spirit it shalbe plainely proued that they fall directly and headlong into aristotles proper

and so much condemned circle prouing the scripture by the spirit and the spirit by the scripture againe in one and the same kind of cause to one and the same person and by one sole and whole manner of proofe
in all which we haue before cleared our selues and our doctrine from the obiected circle against vs
for which we may obserue two principles of

protestant doctrine the one that the scripture only is the rule and meanes to come to the knowledge of the certainty of all thinges to be belieued wherupon they reiect all tradition vnwritten word of god and rely only vpon the written word for the sole and complete rule of fayth
the other that this written word is to be interpreted and vnderstood only by the spirit of the lord which as it is particuler and priuate in euery man so euery man must be directed by his priuate spirit in the vnderstanding and interpreting of the scripture and in the collecting out of it what he is to belieue wherupo they reiect all authority of church councels or fathers and make only the priuate spirit the rule and iudge of interpreting scripture as in the first part is at large proued

which being supposed it will euidently appeare how the protestants runne this circle betweene this priuate spirit and scripture
for aske a protestant how he knowes infallibly which is scripture and which is true sense of it he answeres by the internal testimony of the priuate spirit assuring him it is so
aske him how he infallibly knowes this his internall testimony of his spirit is the testimony of the holy ghost he answers by the scripture assuring him it is so for my sheep heare my voice
aske him againe

how he knowes infallibly this is scripture and this the true meaning of this scripture he runnes backe to the testimony of his spirit
and againe how he knowes that this his testimony of his spirit is the spirit of god he returnes to the scripture againe
thus he wheeles in a round betweene scripture and spirit prouing the scripture by the spirit and the spirit by the scripture an vnknowne spirit by an vnknowne scripture and an vnknowne scripture by an vnknowne spirit one vnknowne by another as vnknowne
and if aristotle did hould it an absurd demonstration proof to proue the conclusion by the premises and the premises againe by the conclusion in the same manner of proofe which was as he reasons as much as to proue a by and againe by a which is either idem per seipsum or ignotum per aequè ig notum and if augustine did count it absurd for the

manichees to proue their fundamental epistle to be canonicall because manes held it to be so and manes to be a prophet or apostle because his fundame~tall epistle did affirme him to be so wherein he himselfe gaue testimony to his epistle and his epistle to him as the maister giues to the seruant and the seruant to the maister when both are in question and if it were absurd for any to belieue simon magus and selena or hellena or montanus and his priscilla and maximilla prophetesses or mahomet and his sergius the arian to be true prophets because one did affirme and proue the other his companion to be a prophet both being suspected and vnknowne and both wanting other kind of proofe then mutuall and circular affection one of another then in like manner it is as great absurdity and folly for one to belieue the scripture and sense of it because the priuate spirit affirmes it to be the true sense and againe the priuate spirit to be the true spirit of god because the scripture interpreted by that priuate spirit affirmes it to be so
in which manner of proofe all the conditions do concurre which aristotle requires to a proper and vnlawfull circle or circular demonstration
for
they proue circularly and reciprocally one another as the spirit proues the scripture and the scripture againe the spirit in which is regressus ab eodem ad idem

they proue circularly one another in eodem genere causae for the spirit is the formall cause why they belieue the sense of the scripture and that sense of scripture is the formall cause why they belieue that to be the spirit of god

they proue one another totally and wholy that is the sole and whole reason why they belieue that is the sense of scripture is the spirit and the sole whole reason why they belieue this is the spirit is that sense of scripture framed by that spirit

they proue one another not only circularly wholy and in the same manner of causes but also to one and the same person
for as this spirit can assure only him who hath it not another that this is true sense of scripture and this true sense of scripture can assure only him not another that this is the true spirit for according to their doctrine no man can be assured of anothers spirit that it is of

god but only himselfe who hath it so doth this priuate spirit and this scripture both assure one person to wit him that hath it and that circularly that this spirit is of god that this scripture is truly vnderstood by this spirit which is most proper to that circle condemned by aristotle for vnlawfull
and thus much of the first proofe

secondly the same absurdities which aristotle infers vpon a circular demonstration betweene the premises and co~clusion do follow vpon this circle betweene the scripture and the spirit
for
the same thing doth proue it selfe
for if by a proue and againe by proue a then proue a by a or if proue the conclusion by the premises and the premises againe by the conclusion then proue the conclusion by it selfe as aristotle reasons
so if proue the spirit by the scripture and the scripture againe by the spirit then proue the spirit by the spirit it selfe for the spirit which proues that the scripture is true by the same scripture proues that it selfe is the true spirit therefore the same is proued by the same

the same thing is prius notum posterius notum in respect of the same thing
for as the conclusion is knowne after the premises as it is proued by them and therefore the premises as it proues them so the spirit is knowne after the scripture as it is proued by scripture to be the spirit and knowne also before the same scripture as it proues it to be scripture and so it is posterius prius cognitum respectu eiusdem first knowne and after knowne in respect of the same

the same thing vnknowne is proued by another vnknowne
for as when simon magus vnknowne to be a prophet is proued to be a prophet by his selena as vnknowne or when montanus is so proued by his maximilla or manes by his epistle and mahomet by his sergius the one vnknowne prophet is proued by another vnknowne so when this scripture and sense of it is knowne by a spirit as vnknowne doubtfull as is the scripture and sense it selfe then one vnknowne is proued by another as vnknowne which is against all manner of lawfull proofe where one ignotum vnknowne must be proued by another notius more knowne
whereupon follow these absurdities

that the

spirit doth proue it selfe

that it doth proue ignotum por ignotum that is the vnknowne sense of scripture by the spirit vnknowne

that this spirit is prius posterius notum in respect of the same scripture
by which absurdities as aristotle did disproue the philosophers circular demonstration of the conclusion by the premises and of the premises againe by the conclusion so we disproue the protestants circular proofe of the spirit by the scripture and of the scripture by the spirit
and as augustine did reiect the manichees proofe who by manes did proue their fundamentall epistle and by their epistle manes and as the fathers reiected the proofe who by montanus proued maximilla to be a prophetesse and by maximilla montanus to be an apostle so do we reiect the protestants proofe who by the scripture will proue their spirit to be of god and by the spirit the sense of scripture to be true
and as a iudge should be partiall and vnwise who should admit the maister to cleare the seruant and the seruant to cleare the maister when both are accused as guilty of the same crime so should we be partiall and vnwise if we should admit their spirit to proue their sense of scripture and their true sense of scripture to proue their spirit when both are in the same circle and both vnknowne and doubtfull
by which we see that protestants walke in a circle and performe that which dauid sayth

the wicked walke in a circle
and that which augustine out of the
psal sayth vvhat is this circuit to go round not to stand to go in a round of errour where they trauell without end for they who go on forward begin in one place and end in another but he who goes in a round neuer ends
this is the labour of the wicked as is shewed in another psalme the wicked walke in a round
thus augustine and that truely for they haue neither beginning from which to deriue nor end wheron to rest themselues and their groundes of doctrine but caput circuitus the head the ground and foundation of their doctrine consists in a circle in which they still wheele in a round out of which they can neuer vnwind themselues and by

which they can neuer proue any thing to be true as aristotle sayth
and thus much of the first kind of circle made by the protestants betweene the spirit and the scripture let vs proceed to the second betweene the spirit and fayth

svbdiv

the circle betweene the spirit and fayth

secondly that they commit another the like circle betweene their spirit and fayth

is likewise proued if first we consider and compare two of their pointes of doctrine generally receaued
the one that they are iustified only by fayth and that vpon it doth depend their spirit by which they interprete scripture so that fayth is the root and origen of the spirit and presupposed to it
the other that the scripture interpreted by the spirit of god or the spirit of god interpreting scripture is the only whole meanes to attaine to fayth and so is the ground and meanes of fayth and therefore presupposed to faith
which supposed aske a protestant how and by what meanes he assures himselfe that he hath true and certaine fayth he answers by his spirit interpreting the scripture or by the scipture interpreted by his spirit which is all one for so they answere but reply that that cannot be because his fayth and the knowledge of it as the mother and origen of his spirit which interprets scripture is according to the former principles precedent and presupposed before the spirit and the knowledge of it therefore the spirit cannot be a ground meanes of fayth which is precedent and presupposed as the cause of this spirit
againe aske him how and by what meanes he assures himselfe that his spirit thus interpreting scripture is the true spirit of god he answers by his faith but reply that cannot be because the scripture interpreted by this spirit or this spirit interpreting scripture is according to the latter principle the sole and whole meanes of fayth therefore it cannot be knowne by fayth sith it is the meanes of fayth presupposed to it
either therefore must

their principles be false that a man is iustifyed by fayth which is the origen of the spirit and that the scripture is the sole meanes of fayth or els if they stand to this their doctrine this circle and absurdity must follow that fayth is first presupposed and knowne before the spirit as the cause of it the spirit is likewise first presupposed and knowne before faith as the meanes to it and so fayth is before the spirit and the spirit before fayth and fayth is knowne before the spirit and the spirit knowne before fayth
and so both fayth and spirit are prius posterius ech of them both first and last knowne in respect of the other which is to incurre the former circle and also the absurdities by which aristotle confutes it

the circle betweene election vnderstanding of scripture

thirdly that a third circle is committed to omit a fourth betweene election and fayth of which the same may be inferred as was betweene faith and the spirit betweene the first and last lincke of this chaine

that is betweene election and the certainty of it and the scripture and the vnderstanding of it shal out of two other principles compared appeare
the first that only the elect and predestinate are endewed with fayth and all the reprobate excluded from it
wherupon also followes that only the elect haue the true spirit of god and right vnderstanding of scripture which according to them are the effects and fruit of fayth and that election is the ground of all fayth spirit and vnderstanding of scripture
the second that they haue certainty by fayth of their election and that by the word of god which doth assure and secure them that they are predestinate so the word of the lord is the meanes of their knowledge and certainty of their election
out of which two positions reason thus election is the ground of fayth of the spirit and of the vnderstanding of scripture according to the former principle because only the elect haue

fayth the spirit and true sense of scripture therefore it is presupposed as knowne before fayth the spirit and sense of scripture and is the ground of them all which once supposed the rest do necessarily follow vpon it and fayling the rest must also faile with it
on the contrary scripture and the true vnderstanding of it is their meanes and only meanes to know the spirit fayth and election according to the latter principle because all their fayth and assurance both of fayth and election is grounded vpon scripture therfore true vnderstanding of scripture must be precedent and presupposed as foreknowne before the knowledge and assurance of election which is to be knowne only by scripture as the only meanes to know it
now according to these principles aske a protestant how he knowes his election he must and doth answere by scripture which is his only meanes to secure him of his fayth and election therefore the true meaning of scripture must be first knowne before either spirit fayth or election can be knowne and assured because it is the only meanes to know them and the last resolution whereon to setle them
on the contrary aske him how he comes to know and be certaine of his true vnderstanding of scripture he must returne backe againe doth answere by the spirit which assures him which is scripture and true sense of it
aske further how he is certaine of his hauing the true spirit he answers by fayth by which he belieues that he hath the true spirit
aske yet lastly how he knowes and is certaine of his fayth he answers because he is elect and chosen and therefore must needes haue faith heere then is election which was before the thing in question now made the last ground of resolution vpon which all the rest as fayth spirit and scripture are to be grounded by which they are resolued knowne as before scripture was made the first meanes and last resolution vpon which spirit faith and election are grounded and by which they are knowne
hence then appeares the circle betweene election and scripture whether shalbe first knowne and be as the meanes to know the other
shall election that cannot be because it must be knowne by

fayth fayth by the spirit and the spirit by scripture then scripture should be first knowne
shall scripture be first knowne that it cannot be because the vnderstanding of scripture depends vpon the spirit the spirit vpon fayth and fayth vpon election therfore election must be first known
scripture therefore must be first knowne as the meanes to know the spirit fayth and election and election must be first knowne as the ground of all fayth spirit and scripture
scripture therefore must proue election as the meanes to know it and election must proue scripture as the ground of the true vnderstanding of it as the premisses must proue the conclusion and the conclusion the premisses as maximilla did proue montanus montanus maximilla to be prophets as manes did proue his fundamentall epistle to be apostolicall and the epistle him to be an apostle
scripture therefore must be first knowne before election and election must be first knowne before scripture both first knowne and both meanes to know first ech other
if both be first which shal be last if both go before which shall follow after let any protesta~t by his spirit vnfold this ridle solue the argument so leaue leape out of the circle
and thus much of the third circle and circular manner of proceeding betweene election and scripture

svbdiv

the circle betweene the spirit of euery man and a generall councell

fovrthly one circle more which obserued out of caluin in his commentaries vpon iohn vpon these wordes try spirits cannot omit because it is notorious and important as being betweene spirit and spirit that is betweene the spirit of euery priuate person and the spirit of a generall councell and with it will close vp this chapter of circular absurdities
caluin

in the foresaid place affirmes
though against himselfe and his owne fellow sectaries that many false doctours do belye and counterfeit the title of the spirit
that mad men ryse vp who rashly brag

that they are endewed with the spirit
that they are fooles who amazed at the empty sound of an honourable title of the spirit dare not inquire after the matter it selfe
that many boast of the spirit yet do come in their owne priuate name and do speake out of their owne proper sense and meaning
all which is true but proper to the protestants

he sayth because of these so many false and counterfeit spirits he enquires how we shal proue and try these spirits to which he answers that they who assigne the word of god as the meane and rule to discerne these spirits ne{que nihil ne{que totum dicunt say somewhat but not all
for except sayth he we haue the spirit of prudence it will little or nothing auaile to haue the vvord on our fingers end whose interpretation or sense is not certaine to vs
therefore according to caluin the scripture alone is not the complete rule or meanes to try spirits
what then
therefore he sayth

euery priuate man hath power and freedome to iudge of spirits that is euery faythfull
the faythfull therefore by their priuate spirit shall try and iudge of spirits
but heere he obiects if so then there will be no certainty of fayth but all religion will perish because there are so many mad spirits which brag of themselues that they are the spirit of god that quot capita tot sensus how many men so many opinions
what then must be the remedy
therefore he admits that the publike iudgment of the church and the determination of an holy councell is necessary to suppresse mad spirits and to settle vnity
this is well for so haue cou~cells some authority but how farre shall al men and their priuate spirits be obliged to rely themselues and rest their iudgment vpon this determination of the councell shall there be a pause and rest of triall and all spirit heere rest and be silent no surely that he will not wherefore
he addes and concludes in which he ouerthrows all that god will not haue vs tyed to the decrees of euery councell

though holy and pious because sayth he it may be they did not call rightly vpon god it is certaine that they for the most haue erred
what then heere must be an examen of the councell that the spirit of it may be tryed
the councell therefore which was made iudge must againe be iudged but by whom by euery faythfull man who by his priuate spirit hath as before

power and liberty to try all spirits euen of councels and to call as he sayth in another place in question all spirits of all prelates bishops and councels to the rule of gods word
loe heere his circular vaine deluding manner of proceeding
there are many mad and bragging spirits it is true
these spirits must be tried it is true
the councell is the fittest and surest meanes to try them it is true
but what shall this councell which hath power to try iudge of these spirits be againe tryed and iudged by euery one of these spirits which will as all will iudge it selfe the spirit of prudence according to caluin it must
then which what is more fond or friuolous what more circular and endlesse that which tryes shall by the same be tried againe
he that did iudge shall by him whome he iudges be iudged againe
the councell shall try and iudge euery priuate spirit and euery spirit shall try and iudge againe the councell
and why because forsooth it may be doubted whether the councell did rightly call vpon god
as though forsooth the same may not as well and much more be doubted of these priuate spirits among which are so many mad foolish and bragging spirits which need a tryall and that by a councell as is grau~ted
surely if this be admitted then are tryalls endlesse and circles will runne on forward backward in infinitum
the councell shall iudge the spirit and the spirit shall iudge the councell againe and the councell it againe and so againe and againe without end one shall iudge and another
if this be not a circle what is if this be not a worke endlesse and infinite what can bee if this be not a meere illusion and deluding of man and a ground groundlesse a question endlesse a circle infinite a proceeding vaine and senselesse in which yet the protestants proceed in their grounds of fayth will refer it to the iudgement of the indifferent reader and so conclude that the protesta~ts run in a round of circles prouing one thing by another and this other by the same and that in the first grounds principles of their fayth and saluation

the private spirits avthority to iudge of controuersies of fayth confuted by doctrinall absurdities following vpon it against fayth
chap
ix idolatry and heresy compared and of foure heads and origens of all late heresies proceeding of the priuate spirit
sect


in the last chapter we haue shewed the circular absurdities which do follow vpon this priuate spirit in the proofe of protestants groundes of their fayth and saluation
in this we are to proceed to the doctrinall absurdityes which follow vpon the same against all faith piety and reason
wherein first we will lay downe the principall points of the protestant fayth and the consequences ensuing vpon it and afterwardes

we will shew what absurdityes do follow first in generall out of the same heades and doctrine next what in particuler do follow
against the articles of the creed and all fayth

against the petitions of the pater noster and all hope and prayers

against the ten commandements all morall vertue good life
and lastly by comparing the catholicke and protestant doctrine togeather we wil shew how the one doth giue all honour and glory to god to christ to his saints his church his sacraments his law his grace and to man also and that the other doth as much derogate and take away all honour and giue all dishonour to the same

which that we may the better vnderstand we may co~ceaue how the diuell that rebell against god

and the enemy of man as he labours by all meanes to auert man fro the loue of god and to conuert him to the loue of the creature so his chiefe desire is to depriue god of his honour due to him and to deriue the same to his creatures thereby to draw man to an affectation of deity to rob god of his honour and to giue it to man
thus in paradise he perswaded our first parents that they should be as gods as himselfe had before in heauen attempted to be like to the highest
for this end this pluto or lucifer of his proserpina that is infidelity his spouse begat two daughters the first and eldest is idolatry the next and second heresy
idolatry he begat in the law of nature which raigned long from soone after adam vntill some yeares after christ
heresy he begat in the law of grace which presently after christ rebelled and sought to tyranyze against christs church
idolatry insteed of one god made many and the true honour of one god diuided to many false gods
heresy insteed of one fayth introduceth many false opinions diuides the vnity of christs church in many sects
idolatry was ingendred as snakes of dunge out of the corruption of vertue and piety and out of the increase of lust ambition and cruelty
heresy in like manner sprung vp out of disobedience pride and lust being like as one egge is to another to idolatry of one viper begat another of one heresy many till at length a whole brood

and sinke full of viperous heresies burst out and infected a great part of the christian world
when therefore by the light of iustice christ iesus idolatry the elder sister with her the long night of pagan darknesse was expelled according to that of apollo me puer hebraeus diuos deus ipse gubernans cedere sede iubet tristemque redire sub and the true light of christian verity piety shined in the church of christ then began the second sister heresy as an obscure mist to couer the sunne of true fayth and to bring in a new darkenes of nouell and erroneous opinions into the church of god

and as heresy is a kind of idolatry

both being vipers of one venter or rather idolatry it selfe for so do cyprian tertullian hierome augustine and other fathers expres+ly tearme it because not only the authour

but the worke being all one and the same heresy doth frame out of mans braine a new idoll of false opinions and proposes them as diuine reuelations from god whereby it either detracts from christ and his truth which is simple totall and indiuisible some point of verity or els addes to the same some falsity in the same manner as idolatry takes from god his true deity and honour due only to him and giues the same to man to whom no deity or godhead is due so this heresy following the stepps of idolatry hath in this our late age made the same manner of beginning progresse as idolatry did in the first age
wherefore it will not be amisse to obserue the manner and to compare the progresse and fruit of both

first therefore idolatry the first borne of satans imps the greatest enemy of god hauing raised vpon earth a generall commotion and rebellion against the only true god and lord of heauen and earth

and wrought in man a conceit of deity and an affectation of the diuine excellency thereby to depriue god of his only and all due honour and to deriue the same vnto man his creature and vassall

did first feine in the mindes of men an imagination that before the world was made all was a chaos that this chaos made to it selfe finem fundum a depth a bottome like an egge which being sitten and hatched brought forth a called

planeta this man woman broughr forth substance motion and generation of these was begot caelum and terra heauen and earth
heauen begat six men called titans that is oceanus ceus tyus hyperion iapetus and cronus who was saturne
the earth begat six women thya rhea themis mnemosyna thetis and hebe which marrying one to another of saturne and rhea were borne pluto neptune and iupiter
saturne receauing from some oracle that he should be expulsed by his sonnes deuoured pluto and neptune intended to haue done the like to all his male children but rhea to saue iupiter gaue a stone insteed of the child to be eaten by saturne which stone being deuoured thrust out of saturns belly pluto neptune the one into hell the other into the sea wherby they were made gods pluto of hell and neptune of the sea and iupiter being sent by rhea his mother to heauen was made the god of heauen
thus were saturne and rhea made parents of gods

and iupiter the chiefe god this iupiter was notorious first for cruelty for he not only killed his vncles the titans and deuoured his daughter medea and tormented his sonnes tantalus and titius

but also butchered and tormented his owne father saturne secondly for lust he passed so farre that by incest of his owne sisters iuno and ceres

he begot of iuno vulcan the god of smithes and of ceres proserpina the queene of hell as likewise out of his owne braine he begat minerua and out of his thigh bacchus
also by adultery of other mens wiues he begat mercury of maie the wife of atlant apollo and diana of latona the wife of cea the graces thalia euphrosine and aglia of hermion the wife of cleanus eudimion of phenissa the wife of alphion musaeus of helena the wife of pandion with many others
not thus content he transformed himselfe into diuers shapes as of an husband and begat of alcmena hercules and of cassiopeia andromedes of a sheepheard and begat of mnemosyna the nine muses of a satyre and begat of anthiope amphion zetas of an eagle and begat of egina eacus of a vulture and begat of a nymphe the palisci in sicily of a swanne begat of hellen leda and of a goose nemesis like a bull he begat of europa minous rhadamantus sarpedon like a beare

he begat of mantea arctos and like a pismire mirmedon of euradremusa being also transformed and shewing himselfe as a starre he begat castor and pollux of leda as gold perseus of danae as a shower of raine ganean of manta
thus a man as wicked as great was made the greatest god his chiefe actions of wickednes cruelty parricide incest adultery fraud were deifyed for diuine
and as the god iupiter so also the other gods begat younge gods and made them like themselues gods thus neptune of a begat trito of amphitrite the cyclopes brontes sterape pyracmon
thus venus had by vulcane cupid by bacchus priapis
thus mars begat cygnus apollo phaeton
and so the gods begat so thicke and so fast young gods that the number of the gods increased according to varro to the number of thirty thousand according to others to many more yea to an infinite number
for when thus idolatry had once taken roote in me~s imaginatio it grew vp to that height that it made gods some greater some lesser some of men some of women as of the greater gods of men mercury mars neptune saturne ioue vulcan apollo
of women iuno vesta venus ceres

minerua diana as of the lesser gods bacchus eolus hercules were thetis aurora bellona women goddesses

and it made gods and adored with diuine honour not only good men but bad also and them for their bad actions as iupiter for his former vices saturne for parricide mars for cruelty mercury for fraud venus for lust iuno for enuy and dedicated to them in signe of diuine honour certaine creatures as to iupiter a goat to diana a hart to ammon a ramme to ceres corne to bacchus wine to vulcane fire to osiris water and to others a fish from which creatures in honour to them they did either alwayes or at certaine tymes abstaine
likewise they honoured their sepulchers as the monuments of gods as the syrians did that of adonis the aegyptians that of osyris the troians of hector the lenconissi of achilles the people of pontus that of patroclus and the people of rodes that of alexander the great

thus did idolatry deify bad men and women and for their bad actions make them gods and giue them diuine honour

thus it made gods some common for all some speciall for particular actions

and occasions
of the speciall gods it made esculapius a god of the sicke februa a goddesse for agues pauor a god for courage bacchus for drunkenes siluanus against dangers in sports meretrix for harlots fessoria for trauellers fortuna for good lucke simula for good memory quies for rest murcia for fatnes genouia against slouth thetrica for actions and comedies esculanus for gold siluer pecunia for mettals iugatinus against thunder tutellina against haile flora against frost rubigo against wormes and locusts agrestis for the fields pelonius against the enimies of the earth spinenis against weeds in corne segetius for sowing corne matura for ripening corne ruana for reaping corne belus for warre victoria for victory honorius for lamentina for cadrea for dore barres and hinges cloatina for the priuies
and which is most to be admired this idolatry so far deluded the wise valiant romans that it perswaded them to build temples offer sacrifice to these gods and goddesses for any commodity or necessity as to volumnus volumna for espoused persons to cantius for wise children to lucina for safe

to opis for the child new borne to vaginatus to keepe it from crying to ganinus for safety of it in the cradle to runinus for good sucking and nursing to stellius to preserue it from lamenesse to adeon that it might loue the mother to mentalis that it might be witty and studious and to berecinthea the mother of all these gods
and one of the romans a philosopher most famous in camillus time among the for his piety temperance for it is said of him that for sixty yeares he liued
he neuer went out of the walles of rome neuer was heard speake idle word neuer spent idle hower neuer had contention with any neuer was noted of any publicke crime by name bruxellus did so increase and multiply the number of the gods in the citty of rome that whereas he found only fiue gods receaued them that is iupiter mars ianus berecinthea vesta he left among them
as many as there were families
thus did gods multiply and increase among that warlike people euery family

hauing a speciall god and many still new gods vpon any new occasion

neither did this idolatry thus rest but proceeded on further first to deify and make gods of the passions of men

as of ira fuga and voluptas which they adored next to giue diuine honour to beasts yea and to sensles creatures thus did whole nations worship for gods the philistines dagon a fish the egiptians apis an oxe the babilonians a dragon and golden statua the israelites a golden calfe and a brasen serpent the persians the sunne the acacians the moone to which they offered sacrifice in like manner as the romans did to iupiter

the grecians to iuno the africans to mars the macedonians to mercury the corinthians to apollo the armenians to bacchus the ephesians to diana

quis furor est quae tanta animas daementia cepit vt volucrem turpemque bouem toruumque draconem canem supplex homo pronus adoret

sayth sedulius
thus did others for want of greater adore as gods some as the chaldeans the planets of saturne iupiter mars sol venus and mercury others as the grecians oceanus of the sea stix acaron of riuers others as the egyptians eolus of the winds herbes in the garden as of leekes garlike and onions yea saith one the basest wind crepitus ventris

felices gentes quibus hac nascuntur in hortis
numina

saith iuuenall of the egiptians
of diuers of which in holy scripture mention is made as of

asteroth the goddesse of the sidonians of

baal the god of the samaritans of

belphegor the god of the moubites of

beelzebub of acaron of

chamos the god of the moabites

rhemnon of the syrians of

norgal of the cutheans

micha in mount ephraim

priapus the god of maaca the mother of asa

hercules the god of the tirians

adonis of the israelites which many others
in al which this idolatry as we see ouerflowed so farre the bankes of all reason and religion that hauing once made a breach and robbed god of his honour it bestowed the same vpon the vilest meanest sort of creatures and that so vnreasonably and senslesly that it is a wonder how men of reason could be so void of

reason as to beleeue professe and follow it
this was the proceeding of idolatry

heresy in like manner as the second impe of sathan which succeeded idolatry and was raysed of her ashes and corruption that it might the better sow the seed of infidelity

and roote it selfe stronger in worldly and carnall affections did in imitation of her elder sister idolatry seeke to rob christ iesus of the verity of his diuine reuelations and his spouse the church of the sincerity of true fayth and religion and transferred the same vnto erroneous and hereticall falsities
for which it inuented and framed in mens conceits an opinion of a priuate spirit which it made the mother and deuiser of all errours and heresies of which as in the primitiue ages of christs church it begat in the braine of manes marcion sabellius arius macedonius nestorius eutiches and others the wicked errours against the trinity of one god three persons in the deity against the sacred incarnatio of one person and two natures in the person of our sauiour christ by which as by so many bastardes of impiety such an infinit brood of heresyes haue since that tyme beene inge~dred in the christian world that the increase of the hath filled or rather defiled a great part of the east church both in asia africke and left behind them the stincke of no fewer then
rotten heresies and hereticall opinions so also in this last age of christ it begat in the braines of an apostata frier martin luther which it coupled with a like apostata nunne and of other apostataes bucer martyr bale knox whome it in like incestuous bed of double apostacy and of all sort of impurity such a number of brats or rather vipers of hereticall opinions and errours as neither the number of them can be recounted of which some haue found out
and more nor can the mischiefe of dissention and cruelty be conceaued with which they haue pestered the most florishing kingdomes of europe and brought in an horrible confusion and desolation in place of former piety and religion

in which we may obserue that as idolatry made chaos or confusion the mother of all so hath heresy made the priuate

spirit which is nothing but a chaos or confused conceit which euery one hath of his owne opinion the mother and conceauer of all hereticall opinions
as idolatry diuised that out of planeta the or fruit of chaos issued heaue and earth and of them so many gods goddesses so hath heresy caused that out of the commixtion of a friars and nuns concupiscence such a number of hereticall opinions and wicked practises should receaue their origen and progresse
as the pagans made iupiter a man of life most wicked and exercised in all practise of cruelty and incestuous carnality a god and the chiefest among the gods so do the protestants canonize luther a man of a most carnall proud and enuious both disposition course of life as an apostle an euangelist a prophet and a man of god
as saturne the false god by idolatry was made the father of many gods chiefly of three iupiter neptune and pluto who also begat many petty gods and filled the world with many innumerable false gods whereby adoration was giuen euen first to men then to the basest and meanest creatures so luther the false apostle and prophet by the instigation of his priuate spirit did beget and deuise foure most monstruous imps of hereticall doctrine and impiety out of which as so many vipers such a number of erroneous and wicked opinions haue flowed that the light of true fayth and religion hath beene obscured and the beauty and splendor thereof hath beene attributed to most false errours fond heresyes
and thus hath heresy succeeded and imitated her elder sister idolatry

now these foure heades or principall heresies

which the priuate spirit the eldest daughter of heresy did beget in luther and his followers braines and out of which as sequels issued such a number of falsities and heresies are these
the first is that the church and bishop of rome is fallen from being the spouse of christ to be the very antichrist himselfe as wholy opposite to christ

and corrupted with all abominable errours of idolatry and superstition out of which haue issued these and such like brats of heresy that therefore the visible and knowne church was latent inuisible

and not extant for many ages and that true fayth and doctrine was banished from the same visible church which was only the roman church and that for many ages some of them say six some ten some twelue some fourteen ages euen since the apostles tyme all which tyme truth lay smothered ouerwhelmed and buried in the dregges of antichristian errour superstition and idolatry
that all the councels prouinciall or generall were the assemblies of antichrist
all the fathers and doctours were deceaued and subiected to antichrist
all the christian people princes or prelates liued in the externall obedience of antichrist
that no lawfull mission or vocation no right ordination or consecration no continuall succession or deriuation of pastours was for all this tyme to be found in the church
that no preaching of the word of god no administration of sacraments no offering of sacrifice no saying of seruice no discipline of church orders and gouernment was holy and lawfull for so many ages till god extraordinarily raysed vp martin luther and by his spirit reformed all
whereupon since that tyme hath ensued as the fruits of the wombe of this priuate spirit and new doctrine all neglect and contempt of church orders lawes or obseruances as of masse and mattins of fasting and festiuall dayes of single life and chastity of obedience and pouerty of pennance and mortification of confession and satisfaction of benedictions and peregrinations and of all workes of austerity piety and deuotion
hence hath ensued all rapine robing of churches and all destruction of monasteries and religious houses all prophanation of holy thinges all cruelty against priests religious men all incestuous and sacrilegious lewdnesse against vowed persons all rebellion against princes for religion all contempt of them and their lawes as not obliging in conscience and all liberty of life and manners to practise whatsoeuer profit or pleasure proposed as most plausible to euery mans humour and disposition

the second and next ofspring of this spirit was iustification by only fayth

in which as they all agree in generall

so it hath beene the mother of many notorious new impietyes from whence as out of a issued these and such like prophane paradoxes as that this fayth is a sole fayth not informed with charity or good workes

a speciall fayth assuring certainty of saluation a perpetuall faith neuer lost a rare fayth giuen only to the elect a fayth couering not curing sinnes imputing not making vs iust apprehending not possessing the iustice of christ
a faith that admits no good workes no merit no profit no necessity yea no possibility either of being iustifyed by any or of hauing power to do any good workes at all because all works euen the best workes of the best men are sinnes and that mortall deseruing eternall damnation though by fayth not imputed to the elect
hence it is that the keeping of the law is impossible that no lawes oblige in conscience that grace is not sufficient that man hath no and cannot but sinne and offend that sacraments are not instrume~ts and meanes but seales and signes of this iustice and iustification by fayth that baptisme is to be giue only to the faithfull and children of the faythful that the eucharist is a signe or figure of christs body receaued only by the faythfull elect
with many such like which hang vpon the former principle

the third and next borne impe of this spirit is the doctrine of originall sinne which against the pelagians luther admitting did yet against the catholike church maintaine to be naturall concupiscence which in the state of corrupt nature remaining in man is very originall sinne it selfe
this originall sinne say they doth corrupt and infect the whole man and all and euery action in man proceeding from it with sinne doth cause that a man in all euen in his best actions doth sinne and can do nothing but sinne and so can neither merit by any good

worke nor satisfy for any sinne doth hinder all internall grace and iustification which should abolish sinne doth take away all ability of all possibility of keeping the commandements or so much as any one of them all obligation to performe any precept of the loue of god or man morall or diuine and so all endeauour and labour to do pennance to seeke perfection to take vp the crosse of christ and mortify our passions and follow him as being needlesse

fruitlesse and impossible by the infection of this concupiscence which they make to be originall sinne

the last and youngest of this spirit is the doctrine of predestination of which though luther layd the egge yet because caluin did hatch the brood maintaine aboue any other before him it is imputed to him as the first hatcher of it and as his bastard is by many lutherans and arminians reiected
the doctrine of which is this that god out of his absolute and irrespectiue will as he predestinated ordained and created some to saluation so by the same will he like wise predestinated ordained and created others to damnation the one because it was his will that they should be saued the other meerely because it was his will without any fault sinne or demerit in them foreseene that they should be damned
to which damnation that he might bring them he did for that end create them and ordained that first adam then all his posterity should sinne that for this sinne he might execute his sentence of damnation for which end he did cause sathan to tempt them to sinne to moue and force them to sinne yea did himselfe take from them all liberty not to sinne and worke in them immediatly by his operation all their sinne and obdurate them in that sinne and for that end that they should haue no remedy or help against sinne he denyed them the benefit of the death of christ and his merits the benefit of vocation to grace of sufficiency of grace of iustification by grace or of glorification by the meanes of grace to all those whome he had thus appointed to damnation and to sinne
on the contrary to them whome he had ordained to be saued he ordayned likewise the death passion of christ as a meane

for that end to them only and by it gaue effectuall vocation sanctification and glorification to them only and of these only who are his only children he maks his church
to these only let them do what they will he imputes no sinne but couers all their sinnes with the cloake of the iustice of christ accounts them iust and notwithstanding all their sinnes loues them as his children esteemes them as his darlinges and enthrones them as heires in his kingdome of heauen among his saints and angels
all which and such like opinions in number infinit and in impiety horrible as so many swarmes of locusts and gnates engendred out of the corruption of all good christianity and conceaued in the wombe of double apostacy and sacriledge between a frier and a nunne by the heat and smoke of this fiery spirit of frensy haue as so many clouds shaddowed the light of true fayth as so many foxes deuoured the lambes of christs sheepfould as so many rootes of ill weedes ouergrowne and choaked the haruest of christs fields and as so many vipers poysoned the soules of an infinit number of christians whereby is left nothing but ruine and vastation of all ancient monuments of piety nothing but horrour and confusion in all discipline and orders of religion nothing but impiety and desolation of all fayth and beliefe in many flourishing kingdomes of christianity
of which as any one in former ages would haue sufficed as a plague to haue infected any country with heresy so al of them compiled in one bundell can bring no lesse then a general mortality of all goodnes in so many countrys infected by the

of absurdities which follow vpon the first head of contempt of all and relying vpon the priuate spirit
sect
ii

bvt let vs proceed and consider in particuler what fruits and consequences and what absurdities contrary to all reason honesty and piety do flow and follow out

of these principles positions
and first to begin with their first principle

and the issue following from it which is their contempt of their condemning the roman church as antichristian and theit bold affirming the true church of christ for so many ages to haue decayed perished and to haue beene inuisible not knowne wholy ouerwhelmed with errours of superstition idolatry antichristianity


it followes that for so many ages that is
or
as before was neither true church or congregation neither lawfull pastours and preachers neither right sacrame~ts or sacrifice neither any diuine seruice or worship of god among any visible company of people in any part of the christian world

it followes that in all those ages all the fathers and doctours all the bishops prelates all the confessours virgins and martyrs and all the councels generall or prouinciall that all the foure doctours of the latin church and the rest with them al the doctours of the east church all the learned among the all ancient bishops of the primitiue church al the cleargy vnder them all the foure first generall councels and the other twelue after them with the prouinciall councels confirmed by them

the bishops and confessours in them that all the holy virgins confessours and martyrs in tyme of most of the ten persecutions and of the arian and emperours that all the emperours of rome constantinople or germany of the east or west all the kinges of italy spaine france england scotland swethland denmarke or poland all and euery one who before luther were christians and professed the christian religion that all these with the people who professed the same christianity with them vnder them were all seduced by a false fayth and false christianity and all liued and dyed in the seruice not of christ but antichrist
into what heart of any christian can it enter that for so many ages no doctour with his penne no prelate out of the pulpit no co~fessour in prison no martyr at his death no councell by their decrees no emperour with his sword no people or pastour in any parish should haue publikly professed· maintayned and confirmed

the true fayth of christ and true doctrine of saluation but all of antichrist and damnation

thirdly it follows that all the predictions

and prophecies of the prophets before christ all the promises and assurances made by christ himselfe or by his apostles to his church either of the extension and amplitude of christes church from sea to sea from north to south to the vttermost end of the world to all people and nations to all iles and kingdomes to all kinges and princes or of continuance succession of the same as long as the sunne moon shall endure from sabaoth to sabaoth from age to age fro generation to generation without interruption or discontinuance from that tyme till the worlds end or of the holy ghosts assistance and continuance with it as the pillar and ground of truth against all the waues and stormes of the sea of this world against all the swordes and violence of persecutors and tyrants and against all principalities and powers the gouernours of this darknesse and the very gates of hell it selfe it followes say that all these predictions haue beene false and not verifyed as castalion and dauid george both protestants conuinced by experience of the not being of a protestant church haue confessed it followes that the prophets of the old testament who foretould them were false not true prophets that the apostles of the new testament who confirmed them were vnlawfull and faythlesse messengers and that iesus christ who planted watered promised to giue increase to this his church was not the on+ly true omnipotent god but either a false deceauer who promised that he knew should not be performed or els a weake worker who could not performe that which he had promised to wit this amplitude succession and firmity of his church thus wholy frustrated and made void according to the former principle and doctrine
all which is wikedly confessed vpon the former groundes by dauid george ochinus and others

fourthly it followes that turkes iewes and gentils haue had a more flourishing state of a church kingdome and professours as hauing beene more visible potent and

dilated for many continued ages in many distant partes of the world then the christians who haue had neither prince prelate people or scarce any publike professours of true christianity for one age together vnder any one king in any one prouince of the world
that mahomet and antichrist or the diuel by them did with more prudence and power with more piety and policy establish enlarge protect their faith and common wealth which so long continued then iesus christ who is true god and man did or could do his faith and church which so soone after his departure erred failed and decayed
where is the greater glory of the second temple

then of the first where is the

ends of the earth giuen to it for a possession where are the

kings and queenes who as nursing fathers are to haue protected it where are the people and nations who with the

gold of arabia and saba were to haue inriched it where are the iles and kingdomes who from the vttermost

ends of the world were to haue waited vpon this church of christ more then any other of iews turks or pagans what was christ lesse true lesse good lesse faythfull lesse able and potent in the establishing and preseruing his kindgome then were moyses or mahomet cyrus or romulus in setling and enlarging their synagogue sect or surely it followes horrour and blasphemy if these positions and points of the protestants priuate spirits doctrine were true and warrantable

of absurdities which follow vpon the second head of sole fayth
sect
iii

secondly out of the second principle and doctrine depending on it which is that a man is iustified by only faith

which is a faith speciall of euery ones owne predestination iustification and glorification so certaine and so sure as that there is a god or that christ is saued so perpetuall that it can neuer be lost and peculiar only to the elect depending vpon their priuat spirit and the rest before mentioned it followes first
that a man is not only

without all doubt or so much as any feare certaine of his predestination past iustification present

and glorification to come but also that he is more certaine of it then he is of the trinity of the incarnation passion resurrection ascension and coming of christ which he belieues only by a faith not supernaturall and diuine but historicall generall and common as they say to the reprobate and diuels yea more certaine then was of his saluation whom they affirme to haue feared doubted distrusted and despaired before his death of his saluation as is afterward shewed
yea as certaine must they be as certaine they are that god is one god or that iesus christ is in heauen or as if iesus christ were present and so told them which are their owne words and comparisons which is both absurd and impious absurd because they haue scripture to auouch the being of one god and the saluation of christ but which auouches to euery ma this his saluatio in particular they haue neither scripture nor reason impious because what greater impiety and blasphemy can be conceaued then to make christ god and man doubtfull of his saluation and themselues sinfull and wicked wretches certaine of theirs

secondly it followes that euery protestant may and must by faith belieue as certaine that of which neither authority of scripture testimony of church

or euidence of reason doth yield any argument of certainty but only his owne priuate spirit and conceit doth suggest and perswade this certainty of euery one his owne iustification and saluation and yet that the same protestants may doubt yea refuse to assent and belieue such articles of faith as both expresse authority of scripture euident proposition of church and confessed testimony of auncient tradition fathers and councels doth fully and frequently deliuer and approue such are many articles now in controuersy as freewill merit good works reall presence prayer to saints for the dead and such like
all which for example caluin and euery protestant do as firmly notwithstanding all the former confessed testimonies reiect and condemne as they belieue the certainty of their owne saluation which notwithstanding

that it be not mentioned or motioned in particular in any such or the former testimonyes they do most vndoubtedly and firmely apprehend and belieue
in which among all absurdities what can be more absurd then without any other reason or testimony but ones owne conceit so firmely to adhere to a thing of importance so vncertaine both in it selfe and in experience and yet not belieue many thinges in themselues so probable and so mainly by so many testimonies confirmed and approued which what is it els but to belieue what euery one will and best likes to reiect what he will not belieue or doth dislike him and so to make euery ones owne will conceit or affection the rule of his fayth and beliefe

thirdly it followes that euery protestant is not only as sure of his own saluation as he is of christs that he ca~not be damned except christ be damned which

luther

caluin

zuinglius expresly though absurdly hold but also that he is as iust holy as any confessour martyr apostle or the mother of god yea euen as iesus christ himself
for sith all are iust according to them not by any iustice internall and inherent in the soule but externall and imputed by fayth which fayth apprehending the iustice of christ which was in him makes it the iustice of euery one in particuler for which he is accounted iust it followes that this iustice of christ which is equally imputed to all the iust doth equally couer all sins maks equally iust all persons yea all as iust as iesus christ whose iustice is theirs and with whose iustice they are equally couered and thereby counted equally iust before god
whence ensues that all are as iust at the first instance of their iustification as christ was both at first and euer till his ascension and that they cannot increase in iustice

be made more iust and iustified still because from the first instant of their iustification they haue all the iustice imputed to them which christ had euer inherent till his ascension in him

are as iust at the first as he euer was at first or last
which though absurd senselesse and impious yet it hath not wanted expresse defenders among them as luther who affirmed all faythfull to be as iust as peter paul our

lady and all saints
as

bucer who affirmed euery minister to be as iust as was iohn baptist then whome was not by the testimony of our sauiour

a greater among the borne of women
and

zuinglius who affirmes that god fauours no lesse euery faythfull christian then he doth christ himselfe and that euery one hath as great right to heauen as christ hath

fourthly it followes that not only all faythfull christians but that all people whether good or bad iewes gentils christians or pagans yea all who euer haue liued or euer shall liue in this world shalbe all saued as sure as christ is saued
this is deduced out of the protestant doctrine two wayes first out of diuers their positions which by many of them chiefly by

caluin are belieued and taught as
that only fayth doth iustify and that it being once had cannot be lost

that this fayth is promised to all faythfull and their seed as it was to abraham and his seed that therefore all the children of the faythfull are sanctifyed in their mothers wombe as being within the couenant made to their parents and their seed as caluin stifly maintaines

that the sacraments and chiefly baptisme are seales or signes of fayth and so are to be ministred only to the faithfull and the children of the faythfull for which farellus at geneua refused to baptize a child whose parents were papists and caluin approued the fact

that therfore the children of the faythfull shalbe saued though they neuer be baptized as the english catechisme teachs because they are borne of faithfull parents so are in the couena~t and sanctifyed before they be borne
if al this should be true

it would follow that because the couenant and promise of fayth and saluation was made for example to abraham and his seed that because abraham had fayth was sealed with the signe of fayth was iust by fayth must continue in fayth and was saued by fayth that therefore his seed ismael and isaac and as isaac so his seed iacob and esau and as iacob so all his seed all the twelue patriarches his sonnes were likewise included in the couenant were all borne of faythfull parents all sanctifyed in their mothers wombe all sealed as faythfull with the circumcision the signe of faith all made iust by fayth all continued in the same fayth and so all saued in heauen by vertue of that fayth
and as they so their seed and children and their childrens children from generation to generation must be likewise included in the couenant be likewise sanctifyed in their mothers wombe be likewise sealed with the signe of the couenant or circumcision be likewise iust by fayth continue iust in fayth and be likewise saued by fayth
and the same which it inferred of iacob and his children and childrens children vnto the worldes end may also be inferred and auouched truly either more generally of adam and all his posterity or more particulerly of any one faythfull and his posterity for euer
for if adam and eue or this particular faythfull person were faythfull iust and saued then their children after them and their childrens children for euer were likewise faythfull iust and saued because as the parents had the promise of fayth made to themselues and their children so their children were borne sanctifyed of these faythfull parents were sealed with the signe of fayth circumcision or baptisme were made iust continued iust by fayth were saued as iust by fayth and as these children so also all their children and childrens children by the same reason were all included in the couenant or promise of fayth were al born sanctifyed by fayth were all to be sealed with the signe of fayth were all made iust by fayth all co~tinued iust by fayth so are all saued by fayth and so all the posterity of adam nati natorum quotquot nascentur abillis as they were included in the promise of fayth made to their parents and them

and therby were all faithfull and continued and ended all faythfull so were they all saued
by which it should follow also not only that all the whole world should be saued and none damned but also that fayth iustification and saluation should descend by inheritance from generation to generatio as landes should by entayle which cannot by any fine or recouery be cut off sold or lost
and as they are all thus faythfull iust by fayth apprehending the iustice of christ and had the iustice of christ equally imputed to them for their iustice so are they all equally iust as iustifyed by the same iustice of christ and all equally iust with christ as hauing the same iustice theirs which was christs and so are all iust and perfect as any saint or christ are all as certaine of saluation as any saint or christ and shalbe all as blessed in heauen as is any saint or christ with whome as they had the same iustice in earth so for the same they shall haue the like glory in heauen
which absurdity as of all absurdities it is most absurd so doth it follow out of the same absurd doctrine

secondly the same absurdity is inferred out of another of the protestants vsually receaued position of doctrine

which is that euery man shallbe saued by only fayth and that by a speciall fayth by which he is bound infallibly to· belieue that he shalbe saued if he wilbe saued out of which their receaued doctrine reason thus

whatsoeuer euery man in particuler is bound to belieue as an article of fayth necessary to his saluation that is true certaine whether he do belieue it or no
but euery man in particular is bound to belieue as an article of his faith necessary to his saluation according to the protestants that he shalbe saued
ergo that euery man in particuler shalbe saued is true certaine according to the protestants doctrine whether he belieue it or no

the maior proposition is true and not deniable in any diuinity because all articles or points of fayth which all are bound to belieue as necessary to saluation and vnder paine of damnation are most certainly true aeternae veritatis antecedenter

and before they be actually belieued whether they be belieued or not by them who ought to belieue them
for so that there is a blessed trinity of three persons one god an incarnation of the sonne of god a resurrection of the body and the like is certainely true in it selfe though the arians nestorians and other heretikes doe not belieue it which yet they are bound to belieue as necessary to saluation
therefore if euery man be bound in like manner to belieue his owne saluation as certainly and as neccessarily as he is bound to belieue the trinity incarnation resurrection that as an article of his fayth it followeth that his saluation is as certainly true as his resurrection whether soeuer he do belieue or not belieue either or both of them and so it is inferred that he shalbe saued as well as ryse againe though he do not belieue it which is confirmed because the obiect of fayth or thing to be belieued hath in it eternall verity before the act of mans fayth doe conceaue or belieue it and therefore is belieued because it is and before was true but is not made true because it is now belieued fayth not making but supposing his obiect which as it houlds true in the verity of the resurrection incarnatio trinity and others point of fayth which are belieued because they are true are true whether they be belieued or not so it must hould true in the verity of euery mans saluation if it be a point of euery mans fayth
for if the certainty of his owne saluation be the obiect of euery mans fayth which he ought to belieue then the same certainty or obiect is true before it be belieued and so it is true that he shalbe saued before he do belieue and true it is whether he so belieue or no

the minor proposition or subsumption that according to the protestants euery ma is to belieue his owne iustificatio and saluation is so certaine that it is their common receaued doctrine that only fayth doth iustify that this only fayth is a speciall faith that this speciall fayth hath for his only obiect which it belieues remission of his sins his iustificatio saluation by christ that this beliefe is a diuine fayth a sauing fayth as certaine a fayth as that by which we belieue that there is a god a iesus christ a heauen or hel so certaine that

it admits no doubt or vncertainty but includes an infallible assured confidence of the promises of god to vs of our saluation
thus sayth caluin

that iustifying faith is a certaine knowledge of gods fauour to vs that

euery one must vndoubtedly be sure that god is mercifull vnto him
beza

that fayth is not to belieue in god or in the word of god which fayth the diuells haue

but a firme perswasion of our election in christ a

certainty by which we are more certaine then of any thing that life euerlasting is due to vs luther

that fayth is a constant firme perswasion without doubt or wauering of gods grace good will due to vs

so certaine that it is aboue all other certainty
bucer

that fayth is nothing but a certaine perswasion of our saluation of christ
the

confession of auspurge of saxony luther lobecius pareus whitaker reynoldes perkins that a man is iustifyed by belieuing and that without wauering or feare of his owne infirmity that his sinnes ere forgiuen that he is iust and shal be saued
yea sayth iewell he must be so certaine as if christ was present and so told him sayth pareus as certaine as that christ dyed for the remission of our sinnes sayth luther and zuinglius as certaine as he is of christs saluatio yea so certaine that except christ be damned he cannot be damned
whereupon they all hould that the obiect of iustifying fayth is not to belieue that christ is god and man was borne dyed and rose for vs nor to belieue the scripture and the word of god in it which is a generall or historicall fayth and common to the reprobate the diuells but to belieue that himselfe hath his sinnes pardoned him is iust and shalbe saued and that god is mercifull to him doth account him iust and will saue him the certainty assurance of which doth iustify him before god
all which may be seene in the authors owne wordes in smiths collation
this is that speciall fayth by which alone protestants hould that euery man is iustifyed saued and without which euery one is damned
therefore this faith is necessary to saluation necessitate medij and as a thing so necessary doth oblige euery one in particuler vnder paine of damnation to haue it because by it all are saued and

without it all are damned
therefore true is the minor proposition that as according to the protestants this faith alone is necessary for euery one to saluation so euery one is bound to haue and so to beleeue it vpon paine of the losse of his saluation

vpon which premises which in the first moode and figure inferre the conclusion followes that according to this protestant position of iustification saluation by only speciall faith that euery one whethersoeuer he belieue or no whether he be faithful or infidel elect or reprobate must be saued
which absurdityas it is most absurd so is the same more fully illustrated and deduced out of the same principle after this manner

speciall faith or infallible assurance of saluation is necessary to saluatio as well to iudas a reprobat as to iames an elect and as iames is saued by it so is iudas damned for want of it according to the protestants therefore vnder paine of his damnation iudas is as well bound to haue it as iames is because it being a necessary meane to saluation the want of it is iudas damnation as the hauing of it is iames his sauation
iudas therfore and that which say of iudas say of all the reprobate is as much obliged vnder paine of his damnation to belieue as an article of his faith that he shalbe saued as iames or any elect is but whatsoeuer iudas and all the reprobate or infidels are bound to belieue as an article of faith necessary to their saluation as wel as iames and the elect must needs be true and that certainly and infallibly true whethersoeuer they do belieue it or no therefore it must needs be true that as well iudas and all the reprobate shalbe saued

as iames and the elect
the fundamental reason of which is this all diuine faith of which kind and that the most chiefe the protestants will haue this their speciall faith to be depends vpon diuine reuelation fro god this reuelation supposeth truth in the obiect or thing reuealed the obiect of truth or thing reuealed is aeterna veritatis and true in it selfe before it be belieued and so true whether it be belieued or no
the obiect therefore of this speciall faith which euery one as well reprobate as elect is bound vnder paine of his damnation to belieue and which is the

remission of his owne sinnes his iustification and saluation is and must be aeternae veritatis is and must be true before it be belieued is and must be true whether it be belieued or no and so it is and must be true that euery man as well reprobate as elect hath remission of sins iustification and saluation it is was eternally true before it was belieued and so is true whether it be belieued or no and so that his sinnes are remitted he iustified and saued whether he belieue or no
and as there cannot be giuen an instance in any other article of faith necessary to saluation in which this reason which indeed is the ground of all faith doth not conuince that the article is true whethersoeuer it be belieued or no so no reason nor answer in any reason according to the same ground of true faith can be giuen why it should not hold good also in this act and obiect of this special faith which if it be diuine faith must participat of the nature essence of all diuine faith
therefore it must follow that either this speciall faith is no diuine faith but an illusion and phantasy or if it be diuine that this absurd absurdity must follow vpon it that man may be saued without any faith and that all shalbe saued whether they haue any faith or none

which is yet confirmed further by these two parities the one diuine the other humane the former thus

as the resurrection of euery man being an article of faith which euery one is bound to belieue is true that is euery man shall ryse againe whethersoeuer he do beleeue it or no so the iustification and saluation of euery man being likewise an article which euery one is bound to belieue or else is damned is likewise true that is he is iustified or saued whethersoeuer he do belieue or no
the reason of both is because remission of sins iustification or saluation of euery one being as well an obiect article of ones faith as the resurrection of euery one is they are both presuposed as true to faith not composed and made true by faith so both alike eternally true both alike true antecedent and before the act of faith and so both true whether they be belieued or no
the later thus as king charles for example whome god preserue is right

and lawfull king of england whether he be by all subiects for such belieued and receaued or no and the obligation that al subiects haue so to acknowledge receaue him vnder paine of treason doth suppose him to be their true king for else it were not truly treason to refuse him so all articles of faith and amongst the rest this of proper saluation are true whether they be belieued or no and the obligation that euery one hath to belieue them and so this vnder paine of damnation doth suppose them and this to be true for else could none vnder paine of damnation be bound to belieue either them

or this of his saluation
therefore as king charles his title and right of being king supposing that all are bound vnder paine of treason to receaue him is good whethersoeuer euery one of his subiects do belieue it and so receaue him or no so the truth of euery mans saluation supposing euery one is bound vnder paine of damnation to belieue it as true is certaine and infallibly true whethersoeuer euery one do so belieue it or no and so shall be iustifyed and saued whether they belieue or no
which absurdity as it is most absurd so the protestant principle of sole and speciall fayth out of which it necessarily followes must needes be absurd and false

the same absurdity may be inferred and is seconded by other like absurd positions of some particuler protestants as by that position of zuinglius who maintained that theseus hercules socrates and aristides all pagans are equally with peter and paul in heauen by that of some of fox his martyrs who as himselfe recordes of them taught that euen a mahometan turke or sarazen may be saued if he trust in god liue well by that of puccius in germany of syr william hickman and some of his fellowes in lincolnshire heere in in england which is also too common in the simple peoples mouths that all men at the last shalbe saued

and that god will suffer none to be damned whome he created
all which as absurd do inferre and second the former absurdity

fifthly it followeth that a man is iustified by a fayth which is in it selfe
false
contradictory
sinnefull
rash
presumptuous
preiudicious to all hope charity and

good life and
iniurious to christ as he is a redeemer a a iudge a priest and also doth make him ignorant sinnefull damned as shalbe proued by euery one of these heades in particuler
and first that this speciall fayth is a fayth not true but false is proued thus
first because a true fayth is of thinges reuealed by god in scripture or tradition and proposed by the church in practise or definition but that either so many of so contrary religions as lutherans caluinists anabaptists familists arians or that any one in any one of these professions is predestinated iustified glorified as they all belieue is neither reuealed in any scripture or tradition from god nor confirmed in any practise or declaration of holy church therefore not a true but a false fayth

a true fayth cannot perswade and propose beliefes doctrines which are contrary and condemne one another but this speciall fayth persuades a beliefe doctrine and certainty of saluation which is contrary and condemneth one another as the fayth and saluation of the lutherans caluinists anabaptists and the rest in number aboue
which are all opposit in fayth all condemne one another and yet are all sure of their saluation by this fayth ergo it cannot be true

secondly

that this fayth is contrary or contradictory in it selfe is proued thus that certainty of fayth is contradictory which belieueth a fayth and doctrine contrary or contradictory but by this certainty of fayth the lutherans caluinists libertines anabaptists trinitarians and the rest do belieue fayth and religions contrary and contradictory as is manifest by the former instances ergo
againe that fayth is contradictory which doth make the same man belieue co~tradictories but this speciall fayth makes men belieue contradictories as that it doth make him iust and doth not mak him iust ergo
that it maks a man iust they affirme because by it a man is iustified that it makes not a man iust is proued because by it he belieues that he is iust therefore he is iust before he belieues it in the same manner as god is god before he is belieued to be god
or thus a man is iust before he belieue because his iustice is the obiect of his fayth and so presupposed to fayth and yet he is not iust before he

belieue because this iustice is the effect of his fayth by which he is iustified and so is after fayth but to be iust and not iust both before he belieue is co~tradictory ergo
againe that is contradictory which is good and not good which doth make a man iust and not iust but this speciall fayth is good because it iustifyes and not good because it is a sin and that mortall ergo
againe it makes a man iust because by it he is iustified not iust because by it he is made sinfull it being a sinne as euery good worke is in their grounds
againe this fayth doth alone iustify and doth not alone iustify alone iustify because caluin and all protestants affirme it it alone doth not iustify because the same caluin affirmes that baptisme is a signe of remission of sinnes past and to come which remission of sinnes to come dependes vpon the memory of baptisme past and so not vpon fayth only
againe this fayth according to them being a worke of man wholy infected with original sinne is a sinne and so maketh a man sinnefull this fayth doth iustify and so is a good worke but to make a man sinnefull and iust are contrary or contradictory ergo
againe it affirmes that euery good worke euen the least of the best person is a sinne so there are no good workes but all sinnes and it affirmes that fayth cannot be without good workes and so there are good workes but to affirme that there are good works and that there are no good workes are contradictory ergo

thirdly that this faith is a sinne and makes a man sinfull is proued thus
euery good worke euen the best worke of the best man according to them is a sinne because it proceeds from a fountaine corrupted with sinne but this faith which iustifieth is such a good worke which consequently is a sinne therfore it maketh a man sinne and so a man is saued from sinne by a worke which is sinne made iust by an act which is iniust adopted the sonne of god by a worke which offendes god and is made partaker of heauen by an act which deserues hell

fourthly that this faith is temerarious is proued thus
that is rashly and lightly belieued which is belieued without any authority of scripture which according to them is

the only meanes of beliefe but there is no scripture that assures for example that either caluin knox or tindall is predestinated hath his sinnes forgiuen him and shalbe glorified in heauen which yet they belieue say they more certainly by this speciall faith then they do the diuinity birth death resurrection or ascension of christ which they belieue onely by an historical faith therfore they rashly and without ground do belieue it
which is confirmed because to belieue things they see men haue sense to belieue morall or mathematicall conclusions they haue reason and demonstration and to belieue articles of faith they haue reuelation of god in scripture but to belieue euery one that his predestination iustification glorification is certaine to him is made knowne neither by experience of sense nor by euidence of reason nor by reuelation of scripture or any way else therefore it is rashly without ground belieued

fiftly that this only speciall faith is presumptuous

is proued thus as that is desperation which will not hope for saluation by grace so that is presumption both the extreames of hope which will hope for it without good works good life obseruance of the commandements and merits to which life eternall is promised but only and speciall faith excludes all good works all merit

all obseruance of the commandements as any meanes of saluation and as not possible to be done

it is great presumption to expect so great and eternall a reward kingdome and felicity without any labour and paines for it without any promise or warrant of it and that without any doubt or feare of the obtaining it all contrary to expresse scripture which wish vs with feare and trembling to worke our saluation

not to be without feare of sinne forgiuen

and assures vs that no man knowes whether he be worthy of loue or hatred


and all contrary to the practise of all saints who haue vsed such continuance and feruour of prayer such rigour and austerity of penance such retirement and forsaking of the world all to obtaine and purchase it at gods hands
which yet this speciall faith will obtaine by only assuring and securing a man most certainly of it without either condition of works and

good life without any works of penance or satisfaction or without any doubt or feare of loosing it or failing in it

sixtly that this only faith destroyes all hope charity prayer and good works is proued thus
no man can hope for that which he hath no man prayes and makes suit for that which he hath

and cannot loose no man labours to practise that which he deems impossible to performe
but this faith assures them of their predestination that they are predestinate and cannot be damned assures them of gods fauour that they haue remission of sinnes and iustification and cannot loose it and assures them of glorification that they shall enioy heauen and saluation which is as due to them as to christ and can no more faile them then it can faile christ where is then any place for hope it assures the that good works and the keeping of the law is impossible that pennance and satisfaction is fruitlesse yea derogating from the merit of christ that all merit by grace or hope of reward for our good deeds is excluded
that such a loue of god is required to wit an intensiue loue with all the force of our soule and an only loue which admits no kind of loue of any thing else as is possible only in the next life not factible in this life therefore by this faith is excluded all hope of reward for good works all necessity of prayer for obteining the kingdome of heauen all vse of saying the lords prayer for remission of sinnes all fruit of penance or satisfaction for the punishment of sinne all possibility of doing good liuing well and louing of god aboue all things and withall is included a necessity of breaking gods commandements of sinning mortally offending in all actions euen in the best actions of the best men as caluin expresly affirmes and yet withall this infallible assurance of the kingdome of heauen is by this faith obteined and confirmed
who will therfore or needs according to these principles to pray to fast to do pennance to forbeare sinne to bridle his concupiscence to do good works to loue god and liue piously since all are needlesse fruitlesse or impossible by this doctrine surely whosoeuer doth either preach this doctrine of good life works pennance and charity as many moderate ministers

do or do practise in their life and conuersation the same as many well intending protestants do they cannot do it either out of the principles and grounds of their religion which we see require no such thing as all opposit to it but either out of the engrafted light of natural reason which doth teach it or out of the good inclination of their natural disposition which doth moue them to it or out of the principles or morall vertues which morall philosophers haue layd for it or out of the doctrine or example imitation or others who they see· practise it and for the practise to deserue a laudable comendation and worthy esteeme among men by it

seauenthdly

that this speciall only faith doth derogate from the vertue and perfection of the incarnation and passion of our sauiour iesus christ is proued thus that faith which makes our blessed sauiour neither generall redeemer of all nor so much as to be their sufficient redeemer and which makes him neither lawgiuer nor nor phisitian nor true sauiour of mankind and also doth make him ignorant impotent vniust sinfull desperate and damned doth derogate from the vertue of the incarnation passion resurrection and ascension of christ but this only and speciall faith and the assurance of iustification by it doth all this ergo

and first that it makes christ no generall redeemer of all mankind is proued


because it takes away from him the vniuersality of his redemption and the extension of his charity to all men
for though christ shed not his blood for the angels neither was a redeemer of them whose fall was not generall of all angells either in indiuiduo or in specie as was mans who wholy fell and sinned especially in adam and whose sinne was more voluntary and very pardonable in that their vnderstanding was greater and their te~ptation lesser then was mans whome the diuell seduced whose sinne was not voluntary in their owne person but in adam their first father yet least christ should either seeme impotent that he could not or vnmercifull that he would not shew his mercy to any estate wholy either of angells or of men it did beseeme and befit the property of his power and goodnesse that it should shew and extend it selfe to the

whole race of mankind at the least and that he should offer vp his bloud sufficiently for the redemption of all and chiefly as he did of those who sinned not actually and willingly but by the sinne and in the will of another as all by originall sinne did in adam
and as it was conuenient so it is testified of him that

he gaue himselfe a redemption for all that

he is a propitiation for our sinnes and not for ours only but also for the whole world that

he would haue all saued and come to the knowledge of the truth that

he is the lambe of god which takes away the sinnes of the world and

whome god gaue his sonne for the world
which word world includes rather the wicked and reprobate then the elect and iust
but this his generall redemption and dying for all men is by this special fayth quite ouerthrowne in that the defenders of it affirme that christ dyed only for the elect not the reprobate that this fayth is giuen only to the elect not to the wicked which infers that christ was either weake and vnable and the value of his passion insufficient

to recompence the debt of all mens sinne· and that the malice of the sinne was more great in all men then the vertue of god was powerfull in christ or that christ was more cruell in rigour of his iustice to condemne the greatest part of the world for sinne then he was mercifull in the tender bowels of his compassion to offer vp his paines and passion for the redemption of al from sinne

secondly that speciall faith makes christ no perfect redeemer of any no not of those elect and iust for whome according to them he was borne and suffered is proued by these
reasons

because they belieue not that christ who as man did suffer did also as god ordaine himselfe thus to suffer nor that christ who as man did offer his sufferings to god iustly offended and required satisfaction in iustice equiualent to the offence did also as god accept of this suffering for the redemption of mans offence though performed by a person who was without offence nor that christ as ma did vndergo all paines and torments which the malice of sathan and man could inflict for the more copious redemption of man to shew therby the goodnes of god the greatnes

of sinne and the ingratitude of man whereas any one action or any one drop of bloud had beene of more worth in dignity and goodnes then all the sinnes of all men were of value in malice and basenes did also as god giue such a dignity worth and value to these sufferings that the least or any one of them as proceeding from the person of god was a price sufficient to haue redeemed all the sinnes of all men and of as many worldes besides as are men if so many had beene because say they will not belieue this worth and value in the workes and sufferings of christ god and man to be so much infinitly greater then all the grauity of all sins of all men as the goodnes of one god is infinitly greater the the malice of all men therefore they require in the passion of christ the selfe same paines and an equall degree in the same paines of christs suffering for men which was due should haue beene inflicted vpon man
therefore say they as man was to suffer in body and soule so was christ to suffer and did suffer not only in body by shedding his bloud which as corporall auailed little but in soule also which for the sinnes of the soule was to suffer the paines due to the soule
and as man was to suffer the paines of hell in body in soule so was christ to suffer and did suffer all the same paines of hell which man should haue suffered and so was presented before the tribunall of god for man as guilty of sinne feared the iudgment of god against this sinne

doubted and feared the sentence of his damnation for this sinne and wauered betweene blessing and cursing of god betweene praysing and blaspheming of god vttered wordes not only of inconsideration and perturbation but euen of desperation and at last suffered all the paines and torments of hell in his soule vpon the crosse which any damned doth suffer or ought to suffer in his soule for the same sinnes in hell
in which
they deny the fulnesse and perfection of christs redemption euen of the elect in that they deny the infinite excesse of dignity and value in euery action and passio of christ as proceeding from his diuine person aboue the malice of sinne

they doe derogate from the vertue of christs bloud shed by his passion of which the scripture affirmes that

he iustified vs in his bloud

that he redeemed vs

in his bloud

washed vs in his bloud

pacifyed for vs in his bloud

purchased vs with his bloud

and made his new in his bloud in that they affirme

nothing had beene done if christ had dyed only a corporall death

they do extenuate the merit of christ in that they auerre

that in the iudgme~t of god there is no place of merit for christ

they do impose vpon our sauiour horrible impiety blasphemy in that they auouch him to haue doubted feared and wauered in his saluation to haue beene ready to curse and blaspheme and to haue despaired and suffered all the torments of the damned in hell
in all which as they impose this horrible blasphemy vpon our sauiour iesus and make him more sinnefull and vncertaine of his saluation then they are of theirs so they do most impiously derogate from the vertue of his death and passion and from the perfection of his rede~ption and in the effect thereof euen in those elect who according to them he only by his death saued redeemed

secondly because to be a perfect and full redeemer of the elect is requisite that he redeeme them from the seruitude and misery into which by sinne they fell which was the seruitude and misery
of sinne into which being depriued of grace they of themselues cannot but fall and of themselues cannot ryse again you

are seruants of sinne

of sathan to whome by sinne they are made captiue and

cannot of themselues resist his will

of sensuality and the

law in the members repugning to the law of the mind which of themselues they cannot maister

of the law of workes which of themselues they cannot performe but by it remaine vnder

the curse

of hell which for their owne demerit is due to them we

haue made a couenant with hell
but by this doctrine of sole fayth that christ did not redeem euen the elect from any of these captiuityes and miseries especially of sinne sathan sensuality and law of workes nor yet from hell is proued
not from the seruitude of sin because the best man in his best workes according to caluin and luther

cannot but sinne as before and because the iust hath no inherent grace or iustice to sanctify him from sinne but only imputatiue couering his sinne and making

him seeme and shew iust
not from the seruitude of sathan because he wants to resist him and so cannot but yield to his instigation and because he still remaines in sinne both originall and actuall and so by sinne remaines satha~s slaue
not from the concupiscence because it still remaynes in him infects euery action proceeding from him and because according to caluin not to haue concupiscence is impossible and according to luther

to haue a vvoman is as necessary for a man as to eate drinke sleep or as to be a man
not fro the seruitude of the law because the performance of the law and the doing of good workes is impossible and because ma though iust remaines still guilty of the disobedience of the law
not from the misery of hell because while a man remaines a worker of sinne a seruer of concupiscence a transgressour of the law and a slaue of sathan as according to the former confessed doctrine euen the iust and elect do he cannot but be subiect to hell and hell be due vnto him therefore if christ redeeme not euen the elect and iust from the seruitude either of sinne sathan sensuality the law or hell as by this their doctrine he doth not he cannot be a perfect and complete redeemer euen of those elect whom only say they he came to redeeme

thirdly that this doctrine makes christ a bad phisitia

worse chirurgeon of soules to cure them of their sinnes is proued because he infuses neither grace into our soares to cure them nor giues strength to our infirmityes to enable vs nor extinguishes the poyson of originall sinne which still infects our actions but only couers our soares and wounds with a faire cloake of his owne iustice presents vs thus couered before god as iust and imputes no sinnes vnto vs though inwardly indeed we remaine vniust and wicked in soule in hart and in all cogitations wordes or actions
what doth christ therfore surely no more then a chirurgeon who finding a man wounded and his woundes festered and infecting the rest of the body should only couer the same with a faire cloath produce and shew him to the people thus couered and for this cure accountes both the man safe and sound and also himselfe a perfect chirurgeon

or phisitian worthy of honour and reward for his paines
such a phisitian or chirurgeon according to them is our sauiour and such a cure doth he worke vpon all his elect whome he cures and redeemes no beter for he cures not by grace infused either the ignorance of the vnderstanding or the malice of the will or the concupiscence of the affections or the infirmity of the exteriour faculties but only couers and hides them with the cloake of his iustice and so imputes them for no sinnes and accounts the persons iust which is all the cure that our phisitian christ workes on vs in their new doctrine

fourthly that this doctrine makes christ either no at all contrary to the prophets who call him a and to his disciple iohn who sayes he gaue a new commandement or els such a as makes lawes which are neither iust vpright nor agreable to reason and equity is manifest

for either they hould that christ made no lawes and was no at al but a sauiour only who tyed vs to none but freed vs from all lawes and cleared our conscience from all obligation to all lawes from all obedience to all lawes and from any scruple or punishment of transgressing any law naturall morall or diuine of church or of god or of man and by the liberty of his ghospell gaue vs freedome to do what we will to omit or comit what we will without condition or obligation but only to belieue and assure our selues that we are sure to be saued
or if they admit any obligation of keeping any lawes as the morall law of the ten commandement or other they auerre it to be impossible to keep them euen for the iust and perfect though assisted with the help of grace whereby they make god cruell in imposing that vpon vs which we are not able to performe vniust in punishing vs for that which he enforces vs to commit vnreasonable in charging vs aboue our ability in punishing vs for not doing that which we could not do
as afterward is more at large shewed

fiftly that this faith doth take from christ all authority either of iudging at all or of iudging vprightly so makes

him either no iudge or an vniust iudge is proued because in a iudge is requisite
that he vnpartially discusse and examine the cause

that he duely reward the iust
that he iustly punish the offender
but this doctrine leaues no place for discussion of sinnes because according to it all works are sinnes as proceeding from originall sinne and infected with originall sinne and all sinnes are a like great as equally forbid by the law of sinne which forbids as well and vnder as great penalty at least in generall of death damnatio the theft of a pin as of a pound therfore all discussio of this difference is needlesse where no difference among them in greatnesse is admitted

it leaues no place for reward of god workes in that it admits neither any workes to bee before god good nor any persons to be inwardly iust nor any merit to be possible by any worke or person nor any reward to be due to any merit but where neither worke is good nor person iust nor merit deseruing there can be no iustice of remuneration in rewarding either good works or iust persons

it leaues no place to the iust punishing of the wicked for where all persons are either already iudged

and sure to be punished as the infidels and pagans are for he that belieues not is already iudged or shall not at all be iudged nor punished as all faithfull protestants shall not who are sure to be saued where the thing commaunded is impossible to be done or the law commaunding doth not oblige to the doing where god doth ordeine that thing to be do~ne and compels the person to do it where the person commaunded hath neither ability to do the thing commaunded if he would nor yet fredome of will to do it if he could there can be no place of iustice in the lawmaker to punish the fact thus committed or the person committing it
but so it is according to the former protestant doctrine
therfore according to the same christ cannot at the day of iudgment iudge any or at the least not iustly and cannot be either a iudge or at least not a iust iudge according to euery mans works

sixtly

that this doctrine doth bereaue christ of his priesthood and power of sacrificing and offering for sinnes

is proued thus as in all states of nature cerimonall or grace sinnes were committed so in all states were sacrifices ordeined for remission of sinnes and priests appointed to offer for the same
in the law of nature the sacrifice was voluntary the priest was the eldest of the family
in the law of moyses the sacrifice was determined to certaine beasts birds and meates and the priests were aarons posterity and the tribe of leui
in the law of grace the sacrifice is the body and bloud of christ and the priests are christs apostles and who are consecrated by lawfull orders from them
christ as in perso so in his priesthood and sacrifice he surpassed both the eldest of the family in the law of nature and the leuiticall priests the sacrifice of both for they were only men he was god man they were men sinfull he was not polluted with sinne they as men and sinners are far distant from god to whom like to men in sinne for whom they offer he as participating of god to whom and of man for whome he offers is one imediate with both
they offered often and many times as wanting one full price able to make a full redemption at once he offered once for all and that a full price satisfaction sufficient for all
they were annointed with materiall oyle of oliues he with internall oyle of deity aboue his companions
they offered sacrifices many in kind and meane in quality all inferiour to themselues he offered one and that most iust euen himselfe and his owne body bloud of which sacrifice himselfe was
the priest annointed by his incarnation to offer

the sacrifice ordeined by himselfe an hoast to be offered

the temple consecrated to god for his holy offering

the altar in his body which was sprinckled with the bloud of this offering for all which reasons abraham and the priests in him· and in his soines as inferiour offered tithes to melchisedech as superiour and in melchisedech to christ figured by him as the chiefe of all
the sacrifices christ offered were of two sorts both of them one and the same in substance to wit his owne body and bloud but and diuerse in the manner of offering the one on the crosse the other at the supper the one bloudy the other vnbloudy the one in his

owne forme of man visible the other in the forme of bread and wine inuisible the one once and not reiterated as being a sufficient price of our redemption the other often as the application of the former and that often repeated as sinnes are often committed
by the one purchasing to himselfe his church in his bloud by the other conseruing sanctifiyng the same to himselfe by his grace
by the one as a cause meritorious deseruing grace pacifying god and reconciling man to god by the other as an instrument causing grace sanctification satisfaction and actuall remission of sinnes for by it as by baptisme is wrought remission of sinnes and as by fayth hope charity and other vertues is obteined grace and saluation

now sith it is euident that christ was
a priest

according to the order not of aaron but of melchisedech

for euer

sith it is euident also
that a priest and sacrifice are correlatiue and so mutuall that where the one is there the other must be

that melchisedech was a priest

and his sacrifice was in bread and wine

that christ is compared to melchisedech not only in his kingly authority as king of iustice and peace as melchisedech was nor only in his genealogy as being without father as man and without mother as god or without predecessor before him or successor after him in the office of redeemer as melchisedech is said to be without father mother

but also in priestly function concealed on purpose by paul

for the incapacity of the iews as a thing of which he hath a speech great and inexplicable to vtter and in his priestly sacrifice by offering bread wine as melchisedech did and that not for one time but for euer
sith say

all this is euident it followes
that christ is a priest not according to aaron in offering bloud but according to melchisedech in offering bread and wine and that not once by himselfe but for euer by his apostles and priests to whom he gaue commission to offer the same sacrifice which himselfe had done

it followes that to verify christs being priest for euer according to the order of melchisedech there must be a succession of priests and sacrifice in gods church to offer the same sacrifice for euer so to make his priesthood continue

for euer
but by this former protestant doctrine is excluded all sacrifice for sinne all priesthood to offer sacrifice and all holy orders to consecrat priests and so this perpetuall priesthood and sacrifice of christ according to melchisedech is reiected
first in christ himselfe and his owne person whome they deny to haue offered any sacrifice at his last supper
secondly in his priests and deputies to whome they deny all authority of priesthood and all power to offer sacrifice and so admit no sacrifice at all according to the order of melchisedech either by christ or his church and why because only fayth doth iustify satisfy and apply the merit of christ only fayth doth couer all sinnes by the apprehension of the iustice of christ only fayth doth assure all that they are iust shall continue and that they need no other worke sacrament or sacrifice to make or keep them iust but only fayth and so this fayth destroyes all sacrifice therby the priesthood of christ

lastly that this doctrine bereaues christ of his knowledge both beatificall by which from the first instance of his conception he did clearely see god and also infused and that not out of thinges naturall and by accidents infused which by nature and industry may be obtained but also of thinges supernaturall and per se infused of things which are by fayth reuealed to vs such as are the mysteries we belieue and the secrets of harts all which by ancient deuines is admitted to haue beene in christ from the first instant of his conception that say they depriue christ of all this excellency and knowledge and make him ignorant and more ignorant then adam who was created as in perfection of stature and strength of body so also in perfection of all philosophicall and theologicall knowledge in soule by which he gaue names to all beasts

and more ignorant then salomon who was the wisest of men before or after him is proued because they affirme that he

assumed our ignorance that he was ignorant like other children was instructed as boyes are increased in knowledge not only experimentall but also habituall as others do learned and profited in artes and sciences humane and diuine as children do that he was iignorant

of the place of lazarus his

of the iewes fayth who offered the man sicke of the palsy of the both of what kind it was and what fruit it bore and of the day of iudgment not only to reueale it to others but to know it himselfe that he made and needlesse illations nothing to purpose wrested the wordes and sense of the prophets weakly confuted his aduersaries failed in memory and made prayers and petitions vnaduised and not premeditated forced with the vehemency of sorrow in the garden all which are by caluin imputed to him
but if christ was thus ignorant and blind in his vnderstanding then might he be deceaued in his iudgement and so deceaue others and faile in truth of that he sayd or reuealed in scripture then may the scripture be false his fayth and doctrine be false all christians be lead into errour and blindnes then may he be infirme in his operations and sinfull also in his actions
for if the vnderstanding which is the light to lighten and the guide to direct the other faculties of the soule may be blind ignorant inconsiderate and erroneous then may the will which doth follow the light and direction of the vnderstanding and wils nothing but that the vnderstanding knowes also faile in the election of good and so will that is ill and commit sinne and so may christ who is the way the truth and the life fall into errour falshood and sinne and so erre deceaue and commit sinne

to all which if we adde the detestable and blasphemous assertions boldly auerred by prime protestants luther caluin and their fellowes against christ to wit that god made him a sinner vniust guilty and hatefull to himselfe that he was culpable a sinner true and most truly a sinner as other men

a sinner most great most vile and obnoxius to the anger of god that he carried himselfe vncurteously and not like a sonne to his mother that he made a prayer vnpremeditated a vow abrupte inconsiderate contrary to his vocation to be corrected retracted and renounced that he renounced his office of mediatour was forgetfull of our saluation and the charge committed to him that he confessed his effeminate nicenesse esteemed himselfe not to be sent of god did wauer betweene

praising and blaspheming of god did stagger among the waues of tentations vttered words of desperation was ouercome with desperatio did renounce his saluation knew god was angry at him that he stood in need of baptisme was cursed and execrable as commonly the damned are

that he suffered the horrour of a conscience feeling gods eternall wrath did feare and highly despaire in his soule in the same manner the damned did wauer betweene hell and life struggle with the horrour of eternall paines had an horrour of eternall punishment was tormented with the feare of horrible damnation was horribly afraid of the profound abisse of death was in feare to be absorpt by death was stroken with the horrour of the diuine malediction was tortured with anxiety as if he had god his enemy feared his saluation was perswaded that he was vndonne and was striken with the horrour of gods iudgment more then euer any man was or could be in which his horrour consisted the summe of our consolation that he suffered the same paines of hell which the damned do suffer tasted felt

and suffered the true paines or dolours of hell the infernall paines and sorrowes of hell was in the middest of the torments of hell suffered the paine of hell the same paine and punishment with the damned the horrible torments of a damned man the eternall paines for the time the execrable death the second death which is the death of the soule the separation from god felt tasted and endured the eternall death the anguish of hell the torments in hell after death both in his body and soule all which are the very summe and abridgement without adding or agrauating of any one word of the more ample speaches and sentences of the most famous protestant doctours and maisters as luther melancthon illyricus reineccius lobecius hutterus vrsinus paraeus in germany of caluin

beza daneus in geneua of tilenus piscator molinaeus polanus in france of vorstius homius in the and of whitaker perkins and parkes in england and may be seene at large in the learned collation of the right reuerend bishop smith

if say we adde all these execrable horrible and blasphemous assertions against the eternal maiesty goodnesse of the sonne of god and compare them with the infallible certainty and assurance which they make euery one of their owne predestination iustification and glorification of

which by faith they make themselues so certaine as if christ had beene present and said they shalbe saued so sure as they are sure that there is a god or that christ is saued which are likewise at large in the same author faithfully collected

if say we adde all this impiety blasphemy and infidelity which is vented and inuented by this priuate spirit and both practised preached and printed by the chief professors of the same and so diuulged to the vew of the whole world to be belieued and professed of all as the word and the pure word of god as the honour and greatest honour of god iesus christ see not what greater hypocrisy dissimulation what deeper blasphemy and abomination can be vttered or by what meanes a readier or broader way to the subuersion of all christianity and piety and the erection of all atheisme barbarisme can be made and prepared
and thus much of the absurdities which ensue vpon the priuate spirits doctrine of sole speciall and certaine iustifying faith the conseque~t points of doctrine depending vpon it

absurdities which follow vpon the third head that is of concupiscence being originall sinne
sect
iiii

ovt of the third principle or progeny of this priuate spirit and the doctrine hanging vpon it which is

that originall sinne which they make to be concupiscence doth remaine in the regenerate and iust is not remitted or abolished by baptisme but only not imputed and couered by faith doth corrupt the whole man all his actions internall and externall doth staine with sinne all good works euen the best of the best men doth strike dead all freewill liberty to do well doth strangle all inherent iustice and sanctification doth stope all merit satisfaction and pennance and doth set a stay to all possibility of keeping the co~mandements with such other like now paradoxes ensuing vpon it out of this say it followes first
that the whole

protestant church and their spouse of christ which consists only of such elect

and regenerat persons as these is if we may so tearme it a kingdome a citty a temple a house a spouse a body of christ by which termes the true church of christ is stiled consisting of subiects citizens seruants persons and members who in euery action euery good worke euen in the best worke of the best of them do sinne nothing but sinne and cannot but commit sinne and that mortally all whose thoughts words and deeds are sinnes mortall sins damnable sinnes and they by these sinnes are vncleane polluted vniust and full of malice in the sight of god who are not able to obserue keepe or performe any one much lesse all the commandements of god as impossible and not obliging vpon any condition to saluation who are idolaters blasphemers forswearers breakers of the sabboth adulterers murtherers theeues false witnesses either in externall action or in internall desire in which they must needs breake euery commandement who cannot by any one act once in all their life belieue feare praise or loue god as they ought who haue no inward grace vertue or iustice inherent and infused in their soules but all sinne deformity pollution rebellion and contumacy against god and his commandements which are also the very words of the foresaid protestants cited by the foresaid authour who are as pointed faces

of themselues deformed and only by colours made to shew faire as sepulchers of dead men outwardly whited but within dead bodies as wolues couered with the woll of sheep but inwardly rauenous as foolish virgins who haue no oyle in their owne lampes but thinke that others oyle shall suffice them as bodies stemed and stinking with corruption of rottenesse leprosy and ordure and only couered with faire cloathes made of the silke of christs iustice such are all elect iust regenerate and holy protestants of such consists their congregations church and with such is filled their kingdome of heauen by such are catholiks condemned and persecuted heere in england

secondly it followes that any faythfull iust and regenerate protestant may in respect of any pitt of damnation as

well commit theft murder adultery periury idolatry sacriledge incest and all enormous vices

as exercise himselfe in abstinence continency iustice or as read the bible heare a sermon receaue the communion say his prayers belieue loue or prayse god and the like
for as both the one and the other proceed from originall sinne are infected thereby with the staine of sinnes and that mortall deseruing eternall damnation so are neither the one nor the other kind imputed to him for sinnes nor are punished with damnation as sinnes
as both the one and the other are damnable in the reprobate and he for both shallbe punished in hell so neither the one nor the other are imputed to the elect nor he for either can be hindred from heaue
as in both the elect and reprobate workes are not distinguished by the obiect but by the person being all mortall sinnes in themselues so in the reprobate all are mortall in the elect all veniall all pardoned none imputed none punished
and as the good workes in the elect do not merit any reward of glory nor satisfy for any punishment of sinne so the bad workes in the same elect shall not receaue any infliction of punishment neither depriue him of any benefit of iustification both therefore the good the bad are in themselues great sinnes as proceeding from concupiscence which is sinne and as violating the law but both are by fayth not imputed both by the iustice of christ couered and so both in a sort indifferent to be committed or omitted as both deseruing and neither receauing punishment both being sinnes in themselues and neither imputed for sinnes by god
vpon what motiue or ground therefore of religion either of displeasing god or of hope of reward or of feare of hell can a regenerate protestant be induced to auoid sinnes rather then good workes

or to liue vertuously rather then vitiously sith both are mortall sinnes both mortally offend god and both equally are not imputed neither punished

thirdly it followes that any faythfull and regenerate protestant may according to the groundes of his fayth commit any or all the former sinnes yea all the sinnes which any reprobate doth commit and yet remaine a iust regenerate

and perfect protestant
for if faith only doth iustify once had can neuer be lost by any sinne whatsoeuer if no sinnes be imputed but all be by the same faith remitted then may he co~mit any or all the said sinnes and yet retaine faith and iustification and keep his assurance of saluation and so continue still a perfect regenerate protestant and is as high in perfection as strong in faith and as sure of saluation as any saint is in heauen who neuer committed any of the same
what conscience therefore or scruple will he make of any the said sinnes sith he shall receiue by them no losse of faith no detriment of iustice no displeasure of god no punishment of hell

fourthly it followes that in vaine and to no end is all penance and sorrow for sinnes all chastising of our bodies which paul vsed for sin all fasting sackcloth hairecloth or ashes with dauid the niniuites manasses achab and others before christ vsed for their sins that in vaine to no end is all forsaking the vanities and pleasures of the world all abnegation resignation mortification and taking vp the crosse of christ in deserts
monasteries places secluded from the world and chosen for practise of pouerty obedience chastity which marke hilarion paul anthony gregory nazianzen basil augustine benedict bernard and so many ancient and holy saints and religious persons since christ haue euer vsed
because only faith doth iustify and secure them of saluation and doth take away all imputation of any sinne or paine due to sinne and so makes needlesse all satisfaction for sinne

because baptisme which according to caluin is to be ministred only to the faythfull doth remit all sinnes past and to come

because all these actes are sinnes and that mortall as well as feasting lusting deceauing killing and the rest

fiftly it followes that in vaine and to no end are all lawes either of god church or commonwealth in vaine are all tribunals

and courtes spirituall and temporall in vaine are all iudges and magistrates appointed to correct punish malefactours in vaine is all power and iurisdiction of princes or prelates in vaine is all regall authority and

commaund of emperours kinges and princes because all obseruance of any law or of any one commandement euen the least is impossible and a burthen sayth caluin greater then aetna because no prince or prelate hath any authority to make any law which shall oblige in conscience because by the liberty of the ghospell euery protestant is freed from any obligation in conscience and from any lawes of any prince whereupon any malefactour guilty of murder theft or the like may answere the iudge and alleadge their doctrine that the lawes did not oblige in conscience and were impossible to be performed no freewill to do otherwise the god had determined no obligation in conscience to obey the kinges lawes being freed by the liberty of the ghospell that the iudge hath no authority to execute that which the king had no authority to decree no iustice to punish him for that which god forced and willed him to do and which he had no liberty or power but to do no reason to hinder the liberty of his spirit graunted by the ghospell
the traitour and rebell may answere his king and alledge out of the same liberty of this ghospell the same reasons and say that he is as free from obedience to his owne prince as to a forain prince or from the lawes of his owne country as of a forraine country may resist his prince and his lawes ryse and rebell against him oppose and depose yea kill and murther his person in case he do not iustice obserue not his own law defend not the or giue not free passage to the preaching of their ghospel
which as after shalbe shewed they haue in germany france scotland belgia geneua other countryes according to these groundes practised and approued and which the trinitarians and anabaptists do according to the same yet positiuely maintaine and defend
in vaine therefore did god giue

to kinges power from himselfe and vertue from the highest
in vaine do

kings rule by god makers of lawes decerne thinges
in vaine is

all power from god and higher powers to be obeyed
in vaine are we to be

subiect to higher powers not only for anger but for conscience
in vaine are we admonished to

be subiect to kinges and rulers and sent from god to be

subiect to princes and powers to be

obedient to carnall lordes and maisters in feare and trembling to

honour them with all honour to

giue to caesar that which is caesars
in vaine is the king made the head and ruler of the
in vaine doth he make lawes inflict punishments appoint iudges iustices and magistrates sith subiects haue no liberty to obey or not obey them no tye in conscience not to violate them but by the liberty of their ghospell are freed from all and the thinges also are either impossible to be done or if omitted it is without any sinne more then veniall at the most that is not imputed
in vaine and foolishly do they condemne popes for assuming power to declare princes deposed or to depose them in case of extreme necessary to conserue the true fayth of god and the right authority of the church or to preuent the grieuous calamity of the common good sith euery one among them may doe the same and more vpon his priuate authority to right his owne priuate wronge
in vaine foolishly doe they accuse and condemne popes for deposing emperours kinges as gregory the second did leo isauricus zachary did chilpericke the king of france gregory the
did henry the
innocent the
did otho the
alexander the
did iohn of england and the like since they themselues in so short a tyme haue deposed two queenes in scotland one bishop of geneua and by armes laboured to depose one queene of england two kings of france three kinges of spaine three emperours of germany from their temporall right and dominion
all which are lawfull and warrantable according to these grounds of their fayth that no lawes are possible or oblige in conscience that no bad workes are imputed or hinder saluation that the liberty of the ghospell makes all actions free and voluntary that only fayth doth iustify and cannot be lost that no man hath freewill nor can do otherwise the god hath decreed
which positions ouerthrow all duety of obedience and all obligation of duty to any prince

sixtly it followes that in vaine and to no end are all consultations and deliberations of thinges to be done by priuate persons in their priuate affaires or by publike councellours of princes for the publicke good because all in

both must be as god hath decreed and man hath no more to do otherwise then he is determined then he hath not to be a man as he was created
in vaine are all precepts and lawes of doing or not doing going or staying bargayning buying or selling because man hath neither freedome of will nor obligation in conscience to do them more then to reach heauen with his fingar
in vaine are all exhortations either priuate or publicke in sermons or in familiar speaches by preachers parents or friends either from euill or to good to one study or other to one course of life or other to one worke or other because man hath no more power or freedome of will to choose any of them then he hath freedome to cure himselfe of the goute or an ague or restore his arme that is cut off
in vaine and to no end are either terrours and threats of punishment or promises and hopes of reward either prayses commendations of good and dispraises and reprehensions of bad deedes because neither are any deeds in themselues good but bad before god nor is any man more free and able to do the one rather the the other then he is to moue mountaines or to adde height to his stature
to what end therefore are maisters offended with the negligence of seruants doe parents correct the vndutifullnes of their children do princes punish the rebellion or offences of their subiects do preachers reprehe~d the vices of their auditours or exhort them to workes of piety and charity disswade them from actions of sinne and iniquity sith the workes be both alike sinnes do both alike violate the precept and are both alike forgiuen and not imputed sith the lawes do not oblige in conscience and are impossible to be kept sith the parties haue no power or freedome to do the one more then the other but all as by the decree of god and force of their originall concupiscence are forced and necessitated to do it

seauenthly it followes that in vaine and to no end

doth any protestant make any scruple of conscience which needes not as a law to direct as a thousand witnesses to accuse as a iudge to condemne or cleare as an executioner to torment and torture him as it doth other men for their sinnes

vnrepe~ted because where no sinne is imputed where no is admitted where no good worke or obseruation of any commandement is possible where no law of god or man doth oblige in conscience to performa~ce what needs any conscience to torment or trouble it selfe with the guilt of any law infringed with the sting of any iniustice committed with the scruple of any good worke omitted since neither the law could be fullfilled nor the act could be preuented nor any punishment shalbe inflicted nor god offended why should therfore be studied any cases of conscience why should be admitted any chancery or court of conscience why should there be any confession of sinnes secret or any restitution of debts and monyes secret any forbearance of wrong secret when there is no feare or shame of man why shall therefore any protestant in life or at death trouble his conscience or haue any scruple of any good worke omitted of any secret murther committed of any iniustice rapine cruelty periury bribery sorcery practised or of any heresy idolatry or infidelity of any iudaisme turcisme or atheisme belieued followed or perswaded surely he needes not for one dramme of fayth of speciall fayth of apprehension of christs iustice compounded with an impossibility of performing the law with the necessity of mans wil with the liberty of the ghospell and with the certainty of present and future iustification will purge all this melancholy feare and scrupulosity and leaue the soule cleare of any doubt feare timidity or vncertainty of heauen for any whatsoeuer sinnes and offences howsoeuer or by whomesoeuer committed

out of all which former absurdities we may obserue these differences betweene a protestant and a catholike a iust man of the one

and a iust man of the other that
a protestant belieues a fayth which neuer any prince prelate or people neuer any doctour confessour or martyr neuer any councell prouinciall or generall belieued for
and more yeares before luther
the catholike belieues the same which all princes christian all prelates and people reputed true christians all confessours martyrs and saints

all councels generall no fewer then eighten and all prouinciall aboue
haue euer since christ professed and belieued
secondly a protestant belieues a fayth which falsifyeth and frustrateth the predictions of the prophets the promises of christ the preaching of the apostles the mission of pastours the succession of prelates the ordination of priests the vertue of miracles the constancy of confessours the purity of virgins the bloud of martyrs and the vnity sanctity antiquity and vniuersality of the catholicke church· the catholike belieues and professes a fayth which verifies and confirmes all the former and in which they agree in beliefe and profession with them all
thirdly the protestants belieue a fayth which hath lesse authority credibility and motiues of persuasion such as are miracles vnity vniuersality and others to persuade and make it credible then hath the fayth of iewes turkes or pagans the catholikes belieue that which hath vnity visibility vniuersality antiquity sanctity prophecies miracles monuments of piety charity bounty and all reasons of probability to persuade and make it credible
fourthly the protestant is made iust by a speciall fayth of which is no mention either in any scripture tradition councell or father and which neither doctour father prelate prince prouince people or person in the world before them belieued and professed as a sauing and iustifying fayth the catholicke is made iust by a catholike fayth which hath beene generall vniuersall wholy by all people prelates and princes in all tymes and places acknowledged and professed
fifthly the protesta~t is made iust by a fayth by which all the seed and posterity of abraham noe and adam yea all iewes gentils turks heretikes wicked blasphemers idolaters murtherers sacrilegious and incestuous persons which haue beene or shalbe till the worlds end may as well be saued and assured of their saluation as they themselues the catholike is made iust by a fayth by which only they who belieue truly and liue piously or repent and amend faithfully can be iustified and saued
sixthly the protestant is made iust by a speciall fayth which is false as belieuing many pointes for true which yet

are contrary one to another which is contradictory as houlding positions contradicting one another which is sinneful as being a sinne and that mortall as all their good works are which is presumptuous presuming without grace to be made holy without merit to attaine a reward without ma~s owne labour and concurrence to be crowned with the glory of heauen which is iniurious to hope which it destroies by certainty to charity which it maks impossible to do good workes all which it turnes into sinnes and that mortall the catholikes are iustifyed by a fayth which admits none of the former absurdities but is true humble vniforme pious and a foundation for hope charity and good life
seauenthly the protestant is iustifyed by a fayth which derogates from the redemption of christ making it neither vniuersall for all nor perfect for any nor able to cure one ma but is only an apprehension of iustice only a couer for sinne only a conceit that a man is iust when he is assured he is vniust which makes christ neither vpright lawyer for that he makes lawes impossible to be kept nor iust iudge for that he giues neither reward or punishment according to deedes and deserts nor perpetuall priest for that he offers no sacrifice at all or but only that one of the crosse which makes christ ignorant getting by degrees knowledge as other men impotent not able to satisfy sinne but with suffering all the paines euen those of hell due to sinne inconsiderate as making prayers vowes vnaduised and not premeditated sinnefull in staggering between praysing and blaspheming god betweene hope and feare of saluation doubting and despairing of his owne saluation and lastly damned in hell and suffering all the paines therein which any damned do the catholike is iustifyed by a fayth which makes christ a perfect redeemer of his part of all men from all sinnes from all both guilte and paine of sinne a iust law giuer in his lawes which are easy and in his iudgments which are according to euery mans workes a potent sauiour who by one action of his diuine person is able to satisfy for all sinne a person alwayes perfect in all knowledge alwayes immaculate without any the least spot of sinne and alwayes blessed

and glorified with the vision and fruition of god euen from his conception
and thus much a protestant and catholike differ in the points of a iustifying fayth

looke further yet into the soule and persons of the one and the other

a iust protestant hath originall sinne remayning in him a iust catholike hath it taken away from him

the one is inwardly infected corrupted and rotten in sinne the other is inwardly pure sound beautifull adorned with grace

the one hath all his actions stained polluted and made damnable by the infection of his original sinne the other hath many of his actions gracious liuely and made meritorious by grace

the one in all his actions euen the best doth offend and displease god the other in all his actions which are not bad doth honour please god

the one by his good actions deserues nothing but eternall damnation the other by his good deedes deserues eternall saluation

the one is iust only before man and by god esteemed iust though he be internally and indeed vniust the other is iust before god and internally and really indeed iust
the one hath no deformity or guilt of sinne washed cured or taken away but only not imputed the other hath all guilt washed cleansed abolished by inherent iustice grace

the one hath neither power nor liberty to do any good worke the other assisted by grace hath do good

the one cannot performe any one commandement the other by grace can performe them all

the one cannot resist but yield to euery motion of concupiscence the other can and doth by grace resist ill motions

the one cannot loue god praise him feare or honour him in any action the other can do it by gods grace in all his actions

the one cannot increase in iustice or grace but is as iust at the first instant of his iustification as euer the other can and doth become more iust patient humble and charitable

the one may commit any sinne though of murder adultery blasphemy heresy or idolatry and yet remaine iust and not loose his iustice nor the fauour of god the other may and must auoid all the same or the like sinnes least he loose grace and be damned

the one let

him do what he will is sure he shalbe saued and cannot by any sinne be damned except christ be damned the other with feare and trembling doth labour to make his election and saluation by good works sure

the one needs to make no conscience of breaking any law of god or man because neither oblige in conscience and both are impossible to be performed the other thinks himselfe tyed in conscience to performe both

the one though he sinne needs no more but only by faith to assure himselfe his sinne is couered by the iustice of christ and not imputed to him the other if he sinne must haue hope charity contrition confession and satisfaction penance and purpose of amendment to sinne no more

the one laies all the burthen of his sinnes vpon christ and his satisfaction and himselfe rests idle and secure the other by the vertue of the same merit of christ labours with all austerity to satisfy himselfe as far as by grace he can and to do his endeauour to pacify god
now whether of these two estates the former of the protestant or the later of the catholick be more honourable to god more agreable to piety more worthy to be esteeme in themselues and so more to be preferred by man let the indifferent reader iudge and make choice

of absurdities which follow vpon the fourth head that is of absolute predestination to damnation
sect


svbdiv

protestants doctrine of predestination makes men desperate

and atheists

ovt of the fourth principle or daughter of his priuate spirit and the issue or consequences ensuing therupon which are that god hath decreed and ordained and that without any foresight or respect to any sinne originall of adam or actuall of man that those who are damned should be damned only because it was his will and pleasure and for

that end did likewise ordaine that they should sinne did by his will and decree excite and compell them to sinne by his motion did effect and worke in them that sinne and obdurate and harden them in sinne necessitate them without to sinne command the diuell to solicit them to sinne both the diuell and other wicked persons and the sinners themselues being only as instruments to effect this sinne himselfe only being the chiefe worker of sinne wherby man hath no power but to sinne no meanes of christs merits to helpe him out of sinne no benefit of vocation faith or grace possible to cure his sinne and so vpon necessity do what he will he must sinne be damned and go to hell for his sins
out of this doctrine which in expresse wordes is caluins his fellowes follow many absurdityes both in respect of man who sins and is damned also in respect of god who makes him sinne damnes him
in regard of man two absurdities follow the one whereby some are made meere polititians and of no religion at all but libertines of any another wherby others are made desperate without any hope or care of saluation by any meanes in any religion at all

the first absurdity of politicians is this god from all eternity hath appointed and determined of vs without any respect of vs or our workes whether we shalbe saued or damned

if we shall be saued he will saue vs if damned he will damne vs both which as he hath decreed without vs so both he will effect without vs infallibly therfore as god hath decreed without vs so shal we be saued or damned do what we can
what therefore haue we to do with eternity of saluation or damnation vvhat with fayth or christ the meanes thereunto but leaue that to god and his ordination let vs follow our temporall commodities and imbrace our sensuall pleasures which are in our power let vs cast off all consideration of heauen or hell and leaue that to god as he ordained disposed and reserued to his owne will and power
thus may they reason that consequently out of the former principle and thus haue both libertins politicians reasoned and thereupon inferred that with catholikes they may be a catholike with lutherans a lutheran with caluinists a caluinist with iewes a iew with turkes a turke and so with any may be of any religion

vpon this ground sprung atheisme which acknowledges neither any god nor any religion paganisme which worships many gods and is of any religion samaritans who made a religion mixt of iewes gentills turcisme which obserues a religion mixt of iewes gentills and christians libertines in augustines tyme who made no important difference betweene the religion of catholikes and donatists and many both libertins and politicians in this tyme

who admit saluation in any religion and profession and thereby inferre and practise a contempt of all piety and religion a liberty of all sinne and dissolution of life and a carelesnesse of heauen all heauenly cogitations
all which as fruit of one tree do by necessary sequell follow out of this doctrine of predestination which the priuate spirit inuented caluin diuulged machiauell confirmed and the diuell by all liberty of sinne and rebellion hath increased and propagated

the second absurdity which is of men made desperate by this doctrine

which is the mother of desperation is this reason and consequence by which they infer thus am either predestinate or reprobate if predestinate it auails nothing to liue wel or ill because necessarily shalbe saued if reprobate it auailes as litle to liue well or ill because certainly must be damned necessarily therefore liue well or ill must be saued or damned
vvhat therefore need care or do but enioy my lust and liberty sith neither good life can hinder hell or help to heauen if be reprobate nor bad life hinder heauen or further hell if be elect if therefore be reprobate necessarily shall be damned what hope therefore can haue of saluation

thus out of this ground did a religious man of augustines monastery in his tyme reason by the force therof foorsooke his cloister returned to the world liued wickedly

and dyed desperatly
out of the same motiue did lewis a in caesarius tyme liue wickedly and reason thus desperatly if be predestinate no sinnes can barre me of heauen if reprobate no good workes can help me to heauen if be appointed at a certaine day to dy can neither by good life make longer my life nor by bad life preuent my death
and he was in danger to haue dyed thus if a wise phisitian had not in his sicknesse by this reason cured his soule if your day be come certainly

you must dye if not you need not my help
vpon which the landsgraue yet pressing him for help of phisicke he further inferred if you can preserue your life by phisicke though your day be appointed why can you not saue your soule by contrition though your end be predestinate by which reason the landsgraue saw his errour and was brought to contrition and confession and that perhaps with better successe then if he had answered as a diuine might and should thus that if you be predestinate to saluation by meanes appointed by god then certainly you shall be saued if you vse and apply those meanes as by gods grace you may and if you be reprobate and appointed to be damned it is for your sins freely committed then certainly you shalbe damned if you commit these sinnes which you may auoid if you will
by which solution as a iust man cannot presume so a sinner needes not despaire but both with and trembling ought to worke their saluation howsoeuer by god they be predestinate

thirdly it followes because a man is thus by the decree and hand of god necessitated to do what god hath by his immutable and ineuitable will determined and appointed that he no freedome of will freedome say not of grace as iust by which he is freed from the seruitude of all sin nor of glory as blessed by which he is freed from the miseries of this life both which are in the next not in this life but no freedome of nature by which his wil hauing al things prerequired to do may yet freely do or not do
no freedome either in things naturall as to speake or to be silent to walke or stand or in things morall as to giue or not giue almes or in things supernaturall as by grace to loue god or not loue him to sinne or not sinne against god
no freedome either of contradictio or quoad exercitium by which he may do or not do any action as to moue or not moue or of contrariety and quoad specificationem by which he may prosecute any obiect good as to loue his neighbour or bad as to hate him
it followes say that a man hath no freedome or liberty either of contradiction or of contrariety either in things naturall morall or supernaturall
and as man hath no freewill at all in any action which both followes from their positions and they grant so it followes that in vaine

is all labour in man either to exercise vertue or to auoide vice
in vaine is all penance or mortification to bridle his concupiscence or passion
in vaine are all exhortations to piety and deuotion and all disswasions from sinne and iniquity because man hath no freedome of will nor power ability to do either the one or the other or the one rather then the other but all necessarily must be done as god hath appointed and doth worke it
it followes that no lawes or precepts of god or man to bid or forbid can be iust
no tribunals of princes or prelates to punish offenders and reward can be vpright because they are imposed on them who haue no liberty to do or not do them and leaue neither possibility nor obligation to be performed by man
it followes that there can be no vertue in doing well or vice in doing ill no iust iugment in rewarding of good or in punishing of bad no crowne of glory in heauen for iust actions or torment of paine in hell for vniust because in man is no indifferency liberty or freedome to do the one rather then the other but is necessitated by the will of god to do that to which he is ordeined
it followes that no contracts of marriage which require a free consent without feare or force can be valid
no temptation to sinne against which is no power or liberty can be auoided
no lawes against malefactours for any crimes because they are not in their power not to do them can be executed
that no difference remaines betweene a man and a beast for where is no free election there is no will where is no will there is no reason where no reason there is no difference betweene a man a beast why therfore are sins prohibited lawes established sermons preached more to men then to beasts sith men haue no more liberty to do or not do to obey or not obey them then beasts why are actions of lust killing and murdering punished in men not in beasts sith men haue no more freedome to absteine from them then beasts why is man rather commanded to absteine from concupiscence then the fier is from burning why more from swearing then the sunne fro shining why more from lying and stealing then the sea from ebbing and flowing why is he commanded to loue god aboue all

more then to touch heauen with his fingar to keepe the sabboth from working more then to keepe his yeares from increasing why not to sinne rather then not to be sicke sith to the one he hath no more power or ability liberty or freedome then to the other which doctrine how high it blocketh vp the way to all vertue and piety and how wide it openeth the gappe to all vice and liberty shall after be shewed
how contrary it is to al authority of holy scripture how iniurious to god preiudicious to man leaue to be seen in other authours how forcible the co~mon consent of all sortes of people is against it austine shal witnesse who sayes that the sheepheards in the mountaines the poets on the stages

the people in the market the learned in the libraries the maisters in the schooles the prelates in the pulpits and all mankind in the whole world do blase out the freedome of mans will which is so certaine that saith he if there be sinne there must be freedome because sinne is so voluntary

as that it is no sinne if it be not voluntary
how euidently euen by common sense and experience it is to be proued

will referre him who will deny it to scotus his sensible demonstration who with blowes not reasons with cudgels not arguments would haue it proued to him till he confesse he hath liberty and freedome to cease from beating him
and how little credit is to be giuen to the teachers of this doctrine in other high pointes of faith aboue reason who so grosly faile in this so manifest both to reason and sense will referre to the iudgment of the indifferent reader and so passe from the absurdities of this protestant predestination touching man to the same as they concerne god and his goodnes

svbdiv

protestant doctrine of predestination makes god the authour of sinne

how iniurious

blasphemous this doctrine of gods absolute predestination to sinne and damnation is to god and how much it doth derogate from his nature goodnesse and iustice shall by these ensuing sequels and absurdities appeare in that it makes god
the authour of sinne


sinfull

only sinfull
a lying and dissembling sinner

a most cruell tyrant

not a god but the very diuel himselfe
all which shal appeare as euidently deduced out of the former doctrine so that if it be true which many of them teach that as we belieue scripture so we must belieue consequences euidently deduced out of it both as points of faith so in like manner as they belieue the former doctrine of gods absolute and irrespectiue decree of mans predestination to damnation and sinne they must also belieue these consequences euidently deduced out of the same first
that god is made by this doctrine the authour of sinne and not only as the manichees made him a bad god the authour of bad nor as florimus did make him the good god the authour of a bad substance but as simon magus did make him the authour of al bad actions and wicked works is proued

because god according to the defenders of this doctrine doth by his absolut and as montague calles it will

predestinate men to eternall damnation

because god by a secret motion doth compell and necessitate the same men to all sinnes that therby he may haue an occassion to condemne and punish them

because god doth commaunde vrge incite the diuell to tempt and induce them to sinne

because that therfore god is the authour of all sinnes which are by these men commited

because god not content with this cruelty doth diuers wayes delude men in shew exteriourly calling and offering his grace

but interiourly denying and detaining them from grace

because god for that end to damne them depriues them of freewill that they cannot repent and of all benefits of the merits of christ and of grace that they can haue no meanes to be saued

because god neuer frees them from originall sinne into which he had cast them but leaues it in them to corrupt al their actions make them sinfull

because god for these sinnes made them vnable to keepe any the least commandement

because from these sinnes god neuer frees them but only couers the sinne imputes the person iust and so saues all the elect
all which reasons are positions in expresse words affirmed especially by caluin cited at large by becanus by luther melancthon sanctius

martyr beza vvhitaker perkins and other prime protestants cited in their owne words by doctour smith

and are confessed by doctour montague in his appeale to caesar and condemned by lutherans as well as catholicks
out of which doctrine it followes
that those actions which we esteeme sinnes as idolatry periury adultery murder theft· pride malice and the rest are no offences against god because he wils commands and works them himselfe

that they are no sinnes because sinne is against the will and law of god but these are according to the will decree and commandement of god which is the rule according to which all actions are to be squared

that sinne is nothing but as the libertins confuted by caluin do hould an opinion of men because it is not contrary but conformable to the will decree and commandement of god

that god in words forbidding sinne and these actions as sinne doth either dissemble as inwardly willing and working that which exteriourly he prohibits or els is contrary to himsele as willing and not willing the same sinnes

that if there be any sins at all then god who is the principall authour agent and not man who is the instrume~t only is the sinner offender

that men are excusable in committing any or all the foresayd actions because they do that which god wils works and which themselues cannot but worke

that no credit can be giuen to the word of god in scripture because god may as well lye in it as he doth in other bookes of pagans or heretikes of both which he is equally the principal authour and dictatour
all which absurdities as they are most horrible and blasphemous so do they all necessarily follow vpon the former protestant positions and must needs be true if the former protestant doctrine and positions be true

that god is by this doctrine not only the authour of sinne but a very sinner and worker not

only of the materiall entity or action by which sinne is co~mitted but also of the formall malice or defect of goodnesse in which sinne consisteth and so is formally a sinner and committer of sinne according to this doctrine is proued

because the teachers of this doctrine as before call god the principall authour actour and the worker of sinne but as sinne is in like manner as a picture a denominate concreet including the malice as the forme and the action as the matter of sinne as the picture doth the forme of a man and the matter of colours of which it is made so he that affirms god to be the author or worker of sinne doth as properly affirme him to be the authour of the malice in sinne as the painter is sayd to be the authour worker of the forme of the picture and so god is as properly a sinner by being the authour and worker of sinne as the workma is a painter by being the authour and worker of the picture
and though in the catholike doctrine god is no more a sinner in that he is in somesort the efficient cause of the reall entity of the sinnefull action to which as the authour of nature he concurs with man as an vniuersall and indifferent agent to any action then the soule is the authour of the lamenesse in the legge or the writer the cause of the ill writing of the penne the defect formality of sinne proceeding from the particular agent man who is the deficient cause as the formall lamenesse or ill writing proceeds from the legge penne in whome is the defect of lamenesse or writing yet in the protestant doctrine which makes god the authour of sinne formally as sinne thereby to shew his iustice in punishing sinne as sinne and sinnefull men for sinne it cannot be auoided but that god is a sinner as the authour of sinne and that formally as sinne and if it would excuse god from being a sinner in that he wills and workes sinne for a good end to shew his iustice then it would also excuse man from sinne in that he sinned for a good end as if he stole to giue almes or kild a man to send him to heauen by which reason euill might be committed that good might come thereupon which is contrary to paul

secondly because the same teachers make god the principall

willer commander and worker of sinne who that he may iustly punish men for sinne whome he hath vpon his owne meere will without any preuision of their sinne ordained and created to be punished and damned doth therefore ordaine will command worke sinne doth force necessitate them to sinne that for the same sinne he may execute his decree of damnation vpon them but whosoeuer is the principal willer commander and worker of sinne must needes be a sinner and more properly a sinner the the instrument which is vsed or the subiect in which the sinne is committed that is man
therefore god must be a sinner properly a sinner and more properly a sinner then man yea and the greatest sinner of all sinners as the chiefe willer commander and worker of all sinnes which is a horrible blasphemy

svbdiv

protestant doctrine of predestination makes god the only sinner

thirdly that god is by this doctrine not only a sinner but also the only sinner and that the diuell

man are innocent and no sinners at all is proued
because if the diuell in tempting to sin be ruled by the will of god to whose command he obeyes if in alluring to sinne he be co~pelled to obey and do what god doth compell him to do

and if the wicked who sinne are not excusable in that they cannot auoid the necessity of sinning which by the ordination of god is imposed vpon them as caluin affirmes if iudas did necessarily betray christ

and herod pilate did necessarily condemne him as beza affirms if the thiefe be compelled to steale by the compulsion of god that for the theft he may be hanged as zuinglius affirmes

then surely is not the thiefe who is compelled but god who co~pels both the diuell to set on the thiefe and the thiefe who steales the sinner who sinnes
for if the goodnesse and badnesse of the worke in euery action is to be attributed to the principall authour willer and worker of it not to the instrument especially such as want freewill vsed in working

it as the well building of the house is to the architect not to the axe and tooles then is the malice of sinne to be imputed to god the principal and chiefe authour not to man only the enforced instrument of it and so only god is the sinner and man innocent and no sinner at all
which is also confirmed out of that saying of augustine that sinne is so voluntary that except it be voluntary it is not sinne

but it is voluntary only in god according to these teachers not in man in whom it is necessary therefore it is a sinne only in god not in man

svbdiv

protestant doctrine of predestination makes god alyer and dissembler

fovrtly that god is by this doctrine of these doctours a great lyer and a deepe dissembler and deluder that is that either god or these doctours must be lyers or dissemblers is proued because the words of god in holy scripture of these protestant doctours in this point are contradictory therfore if gods word be true theirs must be false or if theirs be true then must gods be false and so god must be either a lier in speaking vntruly in scripture or a dissembler in speaking one thing intending another or they strang lyers in belying him
that gods word theirs are contradictory is apparent by these instances
first god saies that

he wils not inquity that

he hateth iniquity that

he hateth sinnes that

both the wicked and his wickednesse is hatefull to him that

salomon did that which was not liked before our lord that

dauid did displease him the one for his idolatry the other for numbring the people but these protestant doctours say the contrary caluin sayes that

god wils and is authour of sinne

willed the sinne of adam and fall of man that

pharao's cruelty pleased god beza sayes that

god wils and decrees euill and the damnation of man that

god wils and is pleased with that which he doth reuenge and punish
peter martyr sayes that

god wils sinne as a meane to his end

hates not sinne which he workes
perkins sayes that

god willed the sinne and fall of adam wils that sinne be committed
bucana sayes that

god wills sinne by his secret and will all which if they be true then the former sayings of god are false and so god lyes or dissembles of if gods be true theirs are false

secondly god sayth

that he hath not done iniquity that

he will not do iniquity that

they erre that worke euill that

he who commits sinne is of the diuell that

he commaunds none to do wickedly that

he did not command the building of the high place of balaam that

he doth not tempt any man to euill

suffers none to be tempted aboue that which he is able
but contrary to all this caluin sayes that

god not only permits but commaunds euill commands and compells the diuell to be a lying spirit in the mouth of prophets

workes the execration of the faithlesse

is the cause of obduration

of pharao's obduration and cruelty that

wickednesse committed by man proceeds from god luther sayes that

god workes in vs good and euill and works euill by vs
melancthon sayes that

the treason of iudas was as proper a worke of god as the conuersion of paul beza sayth that

god doth worke in vs obduration and is the cause of it
sa~ctius sayes that

god is the chiefe authour of obduration doth worke good and euill in vs

doth reward his owne good punish his owne ill workes in vs that

sinne as sinne and malum culpae is preordained of god that

god ordained men to damnation and their sinnes to damne them forsooke them and denyed them grace that they might sinne

compelleth to wickednesse mediatly by himself and by his speciall action
peter martyr sayes that

god doth solicite to deceaue

doth compell to great sinnes to lye to seduce
all which if they be true then the former sayings of god in scripture are false and so god is a lyer a deluder or a dissembler or they foule lyers

thirdly god sayth in scripture that

he wils not the death of the wicked that

he will not haue any to perish that

it is not his will that one of these litle ones perish

but will haue all to be saued and come to the knowledge of the truth
he commaunds that

none shall worship strang gods that none commit murder adultery and theft

he persuades the wicked to repent to be conuerted and repent from their iniquity and to sinne no more

he inuiteth calleth and stretcheth out his hands and would gather sinners vnder his winges as a henne doth her chickins

he would haue all to come to him
but caluin sayes that

god did ordaine and predestinate many yea the most to damnation and created them for that end for no desert or sinne in them but only for that his will was so to haue it

did create them as organs of his anger to destruction of death and that they might come to that end did either depriue them of power to heare the word of god or did blind and dull them in hearing it doth direct his voice to them not to that end that they may heare· but to that end that they may be made more stupid that

he calls them only by word and after a humane manner not because he would haue them come
beza sayes

he will not haue the reprobate conuerted and saued who are not able to haue any will to be conuerted
piscator sayes

he maks shew in words to will that which he wils not and not to will that which he wil so doth he vse holy dissembling
beza sayes

he commandes that which he will not haue done and promiseth that which he will not performe that

he doth not loue all

neuer did nor euer will haue mercy on all that

he would not haue the death of christ to profit the reprobate

will not haue the reprobate conuerted and saued and that they cannot haue any will to be conuerted
zanctius sayes

he calls all according to his outward will and preaching of the ghospell but according to his secret will neither would nor will haue all to come and be saued
perkins sayes

he will not nor hath so much as any will or velleity no not conditionally that all be saued
and therefore it is not true to say that god will haue all saued
and that when paul sayth so he speaketh according to the charitable opinion of men not according to gods will
all which wordes of these protestant doctours as they contradict

the wordes of god for that god doth not will command and worke euill and that he doth will worke and compell to euill that god hates is displeased with sinne iniquity and sinfull persons and that he wils decrees and ordaines the same that god inuites calles desires wils the saluation of all and that he detaines and withouldes men from coming to be saued are quite opposite and contradictory one to another so therefore must either this protesta~t doctrine be false if gods be true or if theirs be true gods must be false and god either a lyer or a dissembler

he that desires to see more of these expresse contradictions betweene the expresse word of god in holy scripture and the protestant doctours in their writinges let him peruse the foresaid collation

where he shall find at large gods expresse wordes that god wills not iniquity their expresse wordes that god wills iniquity gods words that god doth not worke iniquity their wordes that god doth worke iniquity gods words that he doth not co~mand man to sinne their words that god doth command a man to sinne gods words that god doth not tempt to euill their wordes· that he doth tempt to euill gods wordes that god doth hate all who worke iniquity and their wordes that he them gods wordes that he doth not a wicked man remaining wicked their wordes that he doth iustify such a one gods word that he is angry with the faythfull when they sinne their word that he is not angry with them gods word god is delighted with good workes their wordes that he is not delighted with good workes gods words that god is worshipped with good works their wordes that he is not worshipped with them gods wordes that god is pacifyed pleased with good workes their wordes that he is not pacifyed nor pleased with them gods words that god will haue his commandments kept their wordes that he will not haue them kept gods words that god will haue mercy vpon all men their wordes that he will not haue mercy on all men gods wordes that god doth loue all men their wordes that he doth not loue all men gods words that he will haue all men to be saued their wordes· that he will not haue all men to be saued gods wordes that god wills not the death of a sinner their words that god wils the death

of a sinner gods wordes that god made not death their wordes that he made death gods wordes that god hath no need of sinners their wordes that god hath need of sinners gods wordes that god damnes men for their sinnes their wordes that he doth not damne them for their sinnes gods wordes that god can do all thinges their wordes that god cannot do all thinges
all which contradictions being in the forecited booke place expressed in the wordes of god in scripture in the wordes of the authours themselues out of their owne writings and that only in one article concerning god to omit many other such like contradictions concerning christ scripture church sacraments fayth good workes in generall and particuler sinnes iustification the commandements heauen hell and others in particuler to the nu~ber of
in the same authour expressed in the wordes of scripture and the protestant authours themselues do euidently conuince that in most points of controuersies expresse scripture is against them of which also some particuler instances are giuen in the former part of this treatise and that they doe make god who is truth it selfe a false lying or dissembling god in his holy word holy scripture which they would seeme so much to esteeme and honour

svbdiv
protestant doctrine of predestination makes god a most cruell tyrant

that this protestant doctrine doth make god cruel most cruell and more cruell then any tyrant in this world

shall by these their positions and doctrine before proued appeare

in that they affirme god to haue imposed vpon man lawes impossible by him to be performed as the ten commandements and for the breach of them to haue inflicted paines intollerable as
in that they affirme god to haue ordeined appointed and created that vpon his owne meere will and pleasure without any demerit so much as in them foreseene the greater part of mankind to be damned for euer in the torments of hell

in that

he hath taken from these men freedome of will and ordained decreed forced and necessitated these men to sinne that for this he might damne them and for the same hath damned and doth still damne many
by which doctrine is taken away from god his chiefest attribute of mercy which is aboue all his workes and is attributed to him the chiefest property of the diuell which is extreme cruelty

for first

if god do make lawes which are impossible to be kept and inflict punishment which is intollerable to be endured for the breach of them then are gods lawes more seuere then were the laws of draco the athenian who made lawes so cruell that he inflicted death equally vpon all offences as well lesse as greater

as well for taking a bunch of grapes as for stealing a great treasure as well vpon those who were only idle as vpon those who were murderous because sayd he the least offence deserued death a great offence could not haue a greater punishment then death for which demades sayd such lawes were to be writ not with inke but with bloud and solon did after seauenteene yeares abrogate them all and made new but according to this doctrine gods lawes inflict a death not temporall but eternall and paines not for an hower but for euer as well for euery idle word as for an horrible murder

as well for stealing a penny as a thousand pounds as well for an vnuoluntary suggestion to sinne as a voluntary consent act or custome of sinne· and which is more for not doing that which was impossible for them to do or for committing that which god himselfe forced them to commit
memorable are the tyrannies of the herods in holy scripture
of herod the king who to kill one most innoce~t kild all the innocent children about

bethleem
of herod the tetrarch who to please a dancing wench cut off the head of a holy iohn baptist
and of herod who to please the people kild iames

would haue kild peter if the angell had not freed him out of prison
memorable are the crueltyes of adonibezec

who cut off the fingars and toes of
kinges and fed them with scraps vnder his table
of abimelec who kild vpon one stone the seauenty sonnes of ieroboall
of amman

who would haue

kild all the iewes in all the kingdome of assuerus in one day

memorable were the cruelties of hannibal who of dead bodies of the romans made a bridge

and of his wife who said that a ditch full of bloud was a gratefull spectacle
of mythridates who with one letter caused foure score thousand roman merchants to be kild at one tyme in asia
of the hetrurians who tyed the bodies of the liuing romans to the dead that the one might dye by corruptio of the other
of atrius who kild cut in peeces boiled and set before his brother thyestas his owne children to eate
of ptolomy of aegypt who kild his owne sonne memphis borne of his owne sister and wife cleopatra and sent the head handes and feet to his mother for a present

of the emperour who set rome on fire desired to see all the world on the like fire and wished that all the cittizens had but one head that he might cut it off at one blow

of caligula who held that it was lawfull for him to do what he list with any man
of tiberius who kild the most of the senatours of rome

and left caligula his successour because he hoped he would kill the rest and exceed him in cruelty
memorable were the tyrannies of phalaris of aegrigentum who tormented men in a fiery bull
of diomedes of thrace and of busciris of aegypt who gaue their guests to be deuoured by their horses fed them commonly with mans flesh
of dionysius of syracusa of anno of carthage of eliarcus of heraclea of hyparchus of athens all who deuised torments the more cruelly to kill their subiects and of the persecuting emperours who sought all new deuises of tormenting by racke wheels renting brusing and by lingring death

the more cruelly to execute the bodyes of the innocent christians
wherupon the philosophers sayd cruelty is hatefull to god a monster of madnesse and misery that cruelty

and equity cannot be ioyned togeather that cruelty is a wickednesse not humane but bestiall and which cannot stand with equity

but of all crueltyes the most memorable yea horrible and not imaginable if the diuell himselfe had not inuented and deuised it is this cruelty which they impose vpon god who is a god so good so clement so pittifull and so mercifull

that

his mercy is aboue all his works and

from generation to generation that he disposes all things in mercy and doth with good thinges fill the earth that he not only impose lawes vpon man aboue his ability

for the breaking of these laws should inflict but also that he should will

ordaine decree predestinate yea and create and that certainly ineuitably and immutably as the prime and principal cause only because it was his will and pleasure the greatest parte of mankind that is al who are damned to eternal death destruction and damnation in those intollerable paines of for all eternity
and that he did will command worke yea and compell and necessitate man to sinne that for this sinne he might punish and damne him eternally in hell
this certainly is such a cruelty that if it were true it would follow that this good god was more cruell then the former tyrants euer were for they put men to a temporall death god to an eternal
they kild men whom they found in their kingdome god created and made men that he might damne them eternally
they puld downe them whom they had exalted god exalted these to his liknesse for that end that he might cast them downe to the deepest hell
they murdered a few o~ly of their subiects god the greatest part of the world
they kild them against whome they conceiued displeasure or such as had offended them god damnes the who haue no way offended him or sinned yea whom he forces to sinne that for that sinne he may damne them
they punished with great punishment small offences god with eternall punishment no offences
they punished with death men who did otherwise one way or other both deserue death and must dy god damnes them who otherwise then for his will and pleasure were not to be damned as much therfore as the number is greater the punishment more grieuous and the cause of their damnation lesse so much is god by these doctours made more cruel and tyrannicall then any of the former tyrants

if it were a horrible cruelty for a king to call thousands of his subiects out of the country to the court and there to grace and giue them dignity only for that end that when

he had thus graced them he might presently without any fault committed by them torture torment and with all cruelty by his owne hands murder and butcher them alone after another then surely a greater cruelty it is in god to create and bring out of nothing so many millions of soules as are or shalbe in hell tormented to exalte them to the dignity of his owne liknesse in memory will and vnderstanding and to enrich them with so many benefits of nature grace only for that end that without any desert or offence in them he may in those intollerable flames eternally himselfe torment them yea to cause compell and force them to commit such acts of sinne that for the same he may thus punish and damne them
surely this is a cruelty tyranny so great that a greater cannot be conceiued to be in the diuell nor yet be imagined by the diuell himselfe and yet these protestant doctours do not only impute it vnto god but wil haue it to be a property of god and to stand with his mercy
indeed if to make lawes not impossible to be performed if to oblige men to do thinges impossible to be done if to command men to do a worke and then to deny them meanes to do it if to command and will men yea to force and compel them to do some action and then to punish them for doing the same and that with such horrible paines as of hell if this say be mercy and mildnesse be grace and goodnes then what can be seuerity iniustice cruelty and tyranny if this be gods mercy pitty clemency longanimity grace and goodnes to man what is his iustice and seuerity what is or can be cruelty and tyranny if these be his wayes of mercy what are his wayes of iustice if to punish cura condignum and to reward vltra condignum that is to punish lesse and reward more then is deserued be a property of mercy which all attribut to god then to punish without desert yea to cause and force a man to do euill and then to punish him for it is surely no mercy yea no iustice but vnspeakable cruelty and intollerable iniustice
surely if this may be accounted mercy it is a mercy which is mercilesse a mercy which brings all misery and makes millions most miserable
a mercy which makes mercy more then seuere iustice

mercy most extreme iniustice mercy and most inhumane cruelty all one for what greater iniustice and cruelty can there be in a tyrant or a diuell then to choose and picke out so many millions of soules and without any cause giuen by them to ordaine appoint and put them into eternall paines of there to fry for all eternity and to debarre them of all meanes or ability either of the merits of christ or of freedome in themselues or of any other helpes or meanes whatsoeuer to auoid the same so that vpon necessity they must sinne and deserue damnation vpon necessity must for that sinne be da~ned mercilesse mercy vniust iustice nay cruell cruelty of all cruelties the that cruelty it selfe could conceiue or the diuel himself can either deuise or execute
far be it from thee god of mercy who works all in mercy and whose mercy is aboue all thy works

svbdiv

protestant doctrine of predestination makes god a diuell

lastly that this protestant doctrine doth transforme god into a diuell and so doth depriue him of his only

and all goodnes and therby transpose him into the greatest and vilest euill that can be shall by these ensuing reasons appeare

it is the office or property of satan to man to sinne

yea as an aduersary to lay traps to ensnare man in sinne for which in greeke he is called undefined span alphabet a tempter or undefined span alphabet an entrapper or calumniator and in hebrew sathan an aduersary and so he is called

tempter is said to

tempt vs and to temp the hart to lye to the holy ghost


but this is more proper to god according to this protestant doctrine then to the diuell

because god doth not only tempt and moue a man to sinne but which is more doth will ordaine and predestinate a man to sinne and to al the sinnes which are committed

because god is not only our aduersary to oppose vs but so potently doth oppose vs in so weighty a matter as our greatest good that he directly excludes most from all felicity depriues most of all benefit of

it debarres most from all meanes to attaine it entraps most in all the snares which may hinder their progresse vnto it the diuell is but only his instrument to worke that which he wils and execute that which he before had designed against vs therefore god is more our tempter and aduersary then is the diuell

secondly the office and property of the diuell is to sow tares or ill weeds of sinne in the field of our hearts to choake vp all the corne of grace and goodnes the enemy comes and sowes tares
but god doth this according to this doctrine more then the diuell

because god doth worke inwardly in the hearts of sinners doth excecate and obdurate the minds of men

doth strike them with a spirit of errour giddinesse and madnesse and that not by permission but operation as caluin in particuler affirmes

because god doth will command and worke in vs all the sinnes which are wrought as the principall cause and mouer the diuell being only as the instrument and that not free but forced not mouing but moued and not able to do otherwise then by god he is both commanded and compelled as before therfore the chiefe and principall sower of ill seeds and weeds of sinne is god not the diuell

thirdly the office and property of the diuell is to be authour of all sinnes in generall sinne is of the diuell and of lying in particuler who speakes lies of himselfe and is a lier the father of lies

but this is more proper to god then the diuell according to this doctrine

because the diuell did only in adam by tempting him to eat the forbidden fruit remoue an impediment which did hinder ill to wit originall iustice by which the inferiour part was kept in order without rebellion to the superiour

but god did by his will saith caluin ordaine and decree the fall of adam the ruine of all his posterity the miserable condition into which we are all fallen
therfore god was more properly the authour of adams fal then the diuel

because the diuell doth only tempt to sinne indirectly medially that is either obiectiuè proposing sinfull obiects to the phantasy that the will may consent and delight in them or dispositiuè by altering tempering the organs of the senses

that the appetites may with more facility incline vnto them leauing alwayes a freedome of the will to dissent or assent but god according to caluin doth not only by his ineuitable immutable decree and ordinance will and comma~d the same but also by his immediate effectual irresistable concourse operation to euery actio of sin so works the act of sinne in man that he leaues in man neither any operation at all god working all nor any liberty or freedome god necessitating all who is thereby not only the permitter

but the authour of all sinnes the authour as well of the adultery of dauid the treachery of iudas the hardnesse of pharao the cruelty of achab the incest of absalom the reproach of semei the idolatry of the ten tribes of the chaldean destruction of iudea of the iewes and pilates condemning of christ as he is of the conuersion of paul
therefore god is more and truely the immediate worker of sinnes and lyes then the diuell
diabolicall doctrine

svbdiv

obseruations vpon the former doctrine

vpon good ground therefore did castalio who as caluins scholler best vnderstood his maisters mind

not only by his writinges but from his owne mouth affirme that this doctrine of caluin did transfer god into the diuell

and for the same forsooke both him and geneua and writ against him and this his doctrine
truely did peter vermilius a professour of tigure affirme that this doctrine of caluins is a libertine execrable sacrilegious abominable

and altogeather diabolicall doctrine
iustly did the tigurin sacramentaries anno accuse caluin for this doctrine of great impiety cause his bookes writ of this subiect to be rent in peeces by the hangman and to be burnt publickly in the market place by special edict commanded that none should diuulge in their territories any so horrible and detestable opinions

vpon good reason do as yet the lutherans in germany so detest this doctrine that to cleare luther of it they did expunge out of his works these words god doth worke euill in vs
and most

worthily doe the same lutherans generally disclaime both this doctrine

and caluin for it in so much as one of them heshusius a great superintendent affirmes that caluin writ wickedly of the cause of sinne made god the authour of sinne and in his doctrine is horribly contumelious against god pernicious to man and makes not the diuell but god to be the authoisr of lyes
another of them

a professour auouches that not god but the diuell is authour of this predestination and the god of the caluinists

out of which doctrine and sequels vpon it may be obserued


that neuer any doctrine of atheist pagan iew or heretike was so wickedly pernicious and abominable as this of caluin and his followers is for though some made god idle as epicurus others impotent as lucianus others the authour of euill as the cerdonists marcionists and manichees others miserable afflicting himselfe as the thalmudists others no god at all as the atheists yet all these are more tollerable the these caluinists for it is not so ill to be idle as to be doing ill better to make god do nothing then to make him the worker of all wickednesse
it is more tollerable to make god vnable to do good then to make him the authour and actour of doing ill to make him vnable to requit good then vniust to punish where is no desert of ill
it is lesse blasphemy to make two gods the one authour of good and the other the authour of euill then to make one god and yet to make him the authour and worker of euill and of all euill to call him iust and yet to make him the punisher of that in others which he wills commandes and workes by himselfe to account him mercifull and yet vpon his meere will and pleasure without any cause or desert to ordaine create millions of men to eternall torments and damnation
it was not so great impiety in the iewes to make god mourn sorrowfull for the punishment he wrought on hierusalem as it is in the caluinists to make him well pleased with the vnreasonable tormenting of soules in hell to make it one of the chiefest attributes of gods iustice to appoint men to sinne and then for that sinne to punish and damne them
it is not so foolish to say with the foole there is no god at all as it is to say

god is the authour and worker of all wickednesse and yet

the punisher and reuenger of the same for they by the light of reason will condemne and auoid thefts murders periuries iniustice as lying in their power to auoid but these will may by their owne principles practise and exercise them al as being by god forced and necessitated to them as wanting freedome to auoid them and as fearing no punishment for them
though therefore most wicked yet lesse wicked were the former opinions of iewes heretikes and atheists then these of the caluinists

secondly it may be obserued that no caluinist can be certaine and assured either of any verity of scripture or of any article of his faith or of any assurance of his saluation by his priuate spirit for though he may imagine himselfe to be certaine of the sense of scripture of the articles of his fayth and of the infallibility of his saluation that they are reuealed from god yet he may with all according to his principles of fayth imagine that god who reueales these may reueale tell him which is false for as god according to them is he who effectually procures the sinner to sin who as the principall cause vses the sinner as an instrument to commit sinne who incites compels and necessitates the sinner to sinne who phisically and effectually workes and causes the act of sinne so the same god according to them may procure and incite the apostles and prophets as his instruments compel and necessitate them as the chiefe authour and worker and produce in them as the principall agent lyes and vntruthes and so may by them in scripture reueale an vntruth either of the beliefe of the mysteries of their fayth or of the certainty of their saluation
what certainty therefore can they haue from god of reuelations they receaue from him or of any thing suggested by their supposed spirit as from him againe god according to caluin hath one will exteriour another interiour doth call exteriourly whome he withouldes interiourly speakes to them but to make them more deafe giues them light but the more to blind them doth teach them but to make them more dull doth apply to them a remedy but not to cure them for so are caluins wordes
if so then how can any be sure that the calling

the speaking the light the doctrine and the motion of their

spirit as they suppose of god is not rather to detaine then draw them rather to darken then lighten them rather to dull them then teach them rather to increase then cure their diseases surely if the spirit of god may worke and doth more ordinarily worke the bad then the good doth more vsually make shew to call when he intends they shall not come doth more generally make blind then enlighten make obdurate then mollify make dull then teach and wound then cure and if god do more often intend bad the good obduration then illumination damnation then saluation of most whome he cals inuites and makes shew of intending their good and if the greatest part of the world be thus by god deluded and deceaued then why may not or rather should not euery protestant iustly suspect the same of himselfe why may he not rightly feare that god intends one thing by his inward will and pretends another by his outward will that god doth worke errour and deceit in him rather then truth and verity that he is a lying spirit rather then a true in him surely if god hath deceaued more then he hath taught truth darkened more the he hath lightned obdurated more then he hath mollifyed wou~ded more then he hath cured and damned more then he hath saued iustly may euery one both suspect and feare that god may do the like to him sith no ground reason or motiue he hath of the one rather then of the other and no more assurance of his saluation among the lesser number then of his damnation with the

thirdly it may be obserued that the god of these caluinists and precise protestants is not the same with the ancient christians and present catholikes but the one doth so farre differ from the other

that the one of the caluinists doth will decree and predestinate all sinnes which are committed by men and so makes man sinne by the will decree and predestination of god the other of the catholickes doth will decree and predestinate only good works and all good workes and so doth make man to doe good workes according to the will of god

and doth suffer him to do euill according to the man his owne will
the one doth

command vrge and compell sathan to deuise sinnes

and to sollicite men vnto it the other doth bind hould and hinder sathan that he do not tempt man and doth ayde help and assist man that he be not by sathan tempted aboue his power
the one doth himselfe secretly incite moue

necessitate man to sinne the other doth disswade deterre and enable man against sinne
the one is the principall authour

worker and effectour of all sinnes as sinnes and men only his instruments to do that sinne which he workes by them

the other is no authour nor instrument nor worker at all of sinne as sinne but only the efficient cause of that which is good leauing man to be the deficient cause of that which is malice and sinne
the one vpon his meere will because it is his pleasure without any demerit or sinne in man did ordaine predestinate and create most men to damnation and ordained and predestinated only some few to saluation the other created all men to saluation and had a will and desire that all should attaine to it and be saued and ordained none to damnation but vpon his foresight of their sinne by which they would deserue damnation
the one did will appoint

and decree the sinne of adam and of all mankind for that end only that in punishing the most for it he might shew his iustice in freeing other some few from it he might shew his mercy the other did only forsee permit suffer the fal of adam the sin of all his posterity that for the more illustration

of his own goodnes by co~municating himself to man

of his power by exalting man to be god

of his mercy by making himselfe a redeemer of his enemies

of his clemency in suffering all contumelies and iniuries at the hands of his seruants besides the benefit which redou~ds to man by the liberty of his will

and the benefit of martyrdome and other sufferings for the honour of god
the one doth doth excecate obdurate and harden in sinne those who he hath thus ordained to sinne and damnation and for that end doth deny to them all freedome of will all benefit of christs merits all help of grace all meanes of pardon of their sinne of doing good and of attaining to saluation the other doth call inuite and draw men out of sinne doth

stretch out his hands knocke at the dore of their harts offer the benefit of christs merits the light of his fayth the vertue of his grace sufficient and the reward of his glory abounda~t to all

that they may be conuerted come to him saue their soules
the one not only creates man to sinne and workes in sinne but also leaues him in sinne both original and actuall of which he neuer washes and cures the soules of any euen the iust by infusion of any grace but only couers their sinne with the iustice of christ and so leauing him sinnefull and corrupted only imputes him for iust and accounts him as cleane the other is so farre from causing him to sinne that he washes cures and sanctifyes him from sinne infuses into him grace sanctity by which he is really cleane from sinne may actually obserue gods commau~dments fruitfully do good workes meritorious of life euerlasting

lastly the one is the authour and worker of all sinnes is the only sinner is a most cruell sinner and a deluding sinner yea is one who hath all the bad properties and qualities of the diuell and so is the diuell himselfe the other is good all good only good and goodnesse it selfe pittifull mercifull gracious and bountifull to all calling all seeking all and drawing al from vice to vertue from sinne to grace from the of hell and damnation to the of heauen and saluation as much as in him lyes
as great therefore as is the difference betweene these two gods so much different is the god of the caluinists from the god of the catholikes and the religion of the protestants short of the religion of the catholikes
of which who will see more may read a protesta~t booke lately set out by a lutheran the subiect of which is to proue that the caluinists god is not the same with the god of the lutherans and other christians

of absurdities which follow against fayth and the creed
sect
vi

haue at large shewed and that more largely then intended the fecundity of matter still drawing me on that

as idolatry of god made many gods and that these gods still begat new gods till the number of gods was infinit incredible and absurd so heresy by one priuate spirit got many priuate spirits still euery priuate spirit begat a new opinion and doctrine till both the spirits and the doctrine or opinions grew so many and so absurd that so many horrible and foule absurdities haue issued from them as neither piety reason nor common sense can endure to heare them
one only obseruation of which would desire the readers patience and that to my iudgment not vnworthy the consideration occurs that is to compile and bundell vp as into one view certaine maine and principal opinions of these protestants generally receaued which indeed are the chief points controuerted betweene vs and them and to propose to the eye of euery indifferent reader how smoothly they plaine the way to the downefall of saluation by taking away fayth hope and charity

for whereas god created man for himselfe as his end to honour him and all thinges for man as meanes to help him to this end so he gaue him three helpes or meanes one

to know him another to desire him and a third to attaine him
man hath the meanes to know god by fayth to desire him by hope and to attaine him by charity those are three theologicall vertues which haue god their immediate obiect and are as three meanes to prepare man for his iourney to heauen
fayth as the beginning hope as the progresse charity as the end and consummation of iustification and as three partes of our spirituall building fayth as the foundation hope as the walls and charity as the roofe of our saluation
the protestant doctours by their positions and doctrine do oppugne and ouerthrow all these three as in a briefe su~me they are compiled and proposed to vs fayth as it is deliuered in the creed which in twelue articles shewes vs what we are to belieue
hope as it is contained in the pater noster which in seauen petitio~s directs what we are to hope and pray for
charity as it is comprehended in the decalogue which by ten commandements instructs vs what to do what to auoid
in this and after ensuing sections therefore

we will shew how this doctrine doth oppugne and ouerthrow all fayth in the articles of the creed al hope in the petitions of the pater noster and all charity in the ten commandements and thereby doth prepare the way and loose the reines to all errour in beliefe to all despaire or presumption against hope and to all liberty of sinnes and loosenes of life and manners against charity
and first we will lay downe briefly the chiefe points and positions of the protestant doctrine and next out of them inferre the rest

first the opinions and doctrine of the protestants are these

that

only fayth doth iustify

that

this only fayth makes vs certaine and secure of predestination past iustification present and glorification to come

that

this fayth is proper to all the iust and only to them and the elect

that

this fayth once had can neuer at any tyme be lost nor by any sinne be expelled

that

no sinnes how many or great soeuer be imputed to the elect but all couered with the iustice of christ by apprehension of fayth

that

this fayth is obtayned by the priuate spirit in euery man which assures him of his fayth and saluation

that

all workes of all men· euen the iust and best are sinnes and that mortall as infected with originall sinne and as defectiue from perfect obedience

and fullfilling the precept

that

there is no interiour and inherent grace or iustice but all exteriour and imputatiue

that

the fullfilling of all the commandements or any of them is impossible

that

no humane lawes do oblige in conscience to their performance

that

the sacraments chiefly baptisme are seales and signes of predestination to glory of remission of sinnes and perseuerance in gods fauour and that in baptisme are forgiuen sinnes past and to come

that

man by reason of gods decree and originall sinne hath no liberty or freedome of will to do or auoid bad workes

that

god hath ordained and predestinated vpon his meere will and pleasure without any cause giuen or so much as forseene all who are damned both to damnation and to sinne
all which positions as they are auerred by the learned protestants and preached to the people so they do ouerthrow all the articles of the creed all the petitions of the pater noster and all the precepts of the ten commandments and leade to all loosenesse and dissolution of life as shalbe shewed

svbdiv

in generall

dectroying all fayth

and first that these positions do quite ouerthrow take away all diuine and supernaturall fayth which is the first foundation and of our spirituall building the first preparation to life and iustification the first

root of all true vertue and good workes the first gate by which god enters into our soule the first light which shines in our vnderstanding the first true seruice which we offer to god and the first step by which we beginne to walke our iourney to heauen that this doctrine doth quite ouerthrow this fayth and all the articles of the creed proposed in it is proued

because they distinguish three sortes of fayth

historicall of thinges reuealed and related in scripture and proposed by the apostles in the creed such as are the trinity incarnation passion resurrection and ascension of christ with all other articles which all christians vsually belieue

generall of promises in generall and all graces promised by christ to all as the sending of the holy ghost the coming to iudgment the raysing of the dead and the like which are generall for all

speciall of the promise made to euery man in particuler of his predestination iustification and saluation by which euery one is made infallibly certaine that his sinnes are forgiuen him and that he shal be saued
whereas say they make these three sortes of fayth the first and second of these faithes to wit historicall and generall by which they belieue the articles of the creed promises of god in general they

affirme to be faigned not true fayth a shadow of fayth not a real iustifying faith a fayth which is common to the reprobate and damned euen to the diuels themselues and only the third or special fayth they assigne to be the true diuine and supernaturall iustifying fayth which hath for his obiect the speciall mercy of god to them in particuler applyed the certainty of remission of their sinnes assuredly past and security of their saluation infallibly to come by which they doe as much or more assuredly belieue their iustification and saluation then they do the trinity incarnation or the rest of the articles of fayth
now if this speciall fayth be the only true diuine supernaturall and sauing fayth by it is belieued only one article of the creed that not truly as shall appeare to wit remission of sinnes and the historicall and generall fayth by which the rest of the articles are belieued be only a shadow of fayth a fayth of the damned and diuells then we haue

no diuine and supernaturall fayth of the rest of the articles but belieue them only by a faith which is a fained faith a shadow and no more a guift of god then the fayth of the damned and the diuells in hell
therefore all true diuine beliefe of the articles of the creed is by this special doctrine of speciall fayth quite abolished and taken away from all christians and nothing but a shadow of fayth a fained and diabolicall faith left to them and so by one position of theirs is cut off all diuine fayth or beliefe of all the articles of the creed

secondly whiles they deny all authority of tradition

church councels and fathers and will belieue nothing but what they themselues find in scripture and that as their priuate spirit interprets it while they make their spirit the iudge of all fayth all controuersies of fayth what is to be receaued or reiected belieued or condemned while say

they doe thus they may by the vertue of this spirit call in question the authority and credit of the creed it selfe with the authours of it as not to be found in scripture and the particuler articles they may either reiect as counterfeit intruded or els expound and interpret them as their spirit shal lead them
thus luther and caluin following erasmus for erasmus is sayd to haue layd the egge which luther hatched to haue insinuated that which luther assured

to haue doubted of that which luther downe right denyed made doubt of the authority of the creed whether it was made by the apostles or not
and the seruetians in transiluania witnesse canisius admit it but so farre as it agrees with the word of god

interpreted no doubt by their spirit
thus did beza by his spirit affirme that part of the sixt article he descended into hell

to haue been thrust into the creed
thus caluin and zuinglius following likewise erasmus by their spirit affirmed that part of the tenth article the communion of saints to haue beene intruded into this creed out of some other creed and not to haue beene found in the ancient creeds
thus luther by his spirit changed in his germane creed the word catholike church into christian church
and beza reiected the same word catholike as most vaine and wicked
and thus by their glosses

and expositions vpon many articles as not pleasing their tast they wrest diuers as shall appeare from their natiue proper sense for example he descended into hell that is he descended into the graue so make a new creed in sense and meaning agreable to their spirit and the doctrine of it
of which who will haue a full view let him read andr
iur his nullus and nemo and fitzsimons vpon the masse where their many absurd glosses and expositions are at large discouered and confuted

svbdiv

in particuler against all the twelue articles of the creed

thirdl because by this doctrine and these doctours are oppugned in particuler all the mysteries of fayth in euery article of the creed

which by this briefe enumeration of euery one shalbe made manifest
and first in the first article attributed to peter follow the diuision of augustine and doctour kellison is oppugned
the faith and beliefe of all the articles in generall in the word credo by all who hould that it is only a shadow a faigned diabolicall fayth not a true diuine and supernaturall fayth tending to iustification by which euery christian belieues these articles

is oppugned the vnity of god deum by caluin who houldes that the sonne hath an essence distinct from the father by beza and stegius who hould that the essence is diuided into three persons

by luther who houldes that the diuinity is threefold

by melancthon who houldes that there are three diuinities or essences in god by sanctius who entitles his booke de tribus eloim of three gods

by the tritheits in polonia who expresly hould there are three gods and three eternalls

is oppugned the it selfe and his mercy and goodnesse
by all those who make god the authour willer commander and worker of sinne and damnation because so is his will and pleasure who make him a sinner a great sinner the only sinner who make him a lier a dissembler a tyrant and

transforme him into a very deuill himselfe

as is before proued and deduced

by those who make the diuinity of god passible as with eutiches the auncient condemned hereticke

luther and iacobus andreas do

by those who affirme the diuinity to haue beene not only a mediatour betweene god and man as caluin and beza did but also to haue beene obedie~t to god as melancton and after him many lutherans tigurins also did
and further to haue exercised the office of a priest offering sacrifice to god as iewell did affirme
all which opinions do make many diuinities in god one inferiour to another because where one is a mediatour is obedient doth offer sacrifice to another there must be a subordination subiection and distinction there one must be inferiour and distinct from the other and so there must be many distinct diuinities and these inferiour one to another which is contrary to the nature of diuinity

is oppugned the person of the father

and with him the whole trinity by luther who affirmes that the diuinity is as well three and of three sorts as are the three persons that the word trinity is an humane inuention a word which sounds coldly and is not to be vsed but insteed of it the word god and did therupon thrust out of his letanies that prayer

holy trinity one god haue mercy on vs
and did leaue out of his germane bible those words of iohn alleadged by athanasius cyprian fulgentius to proue he blessed trinity against the arrians there are three which giue testimony in heauen the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
to all which also caluin subscribes who not only affirmes that the prayer holy trinity one god haue mercy on vs doth displease him as sauouring of barbarisme

but also wrests all those places by which the fathers out of the old and new testament did proue against iews and arrians the diuinity of christ to a contrary sense and meaning as the luthera~s

in diuers bookes on set purpose against him haue conuinced
and danaeus

his successor after beza followes him who affirmes that the same word trinity and the same prayer holy trinity haue mercy on vs

is a foolish and dangerous prayer
all which are directly contrary to the auncient orthodox and catholicke doctrine of the trinity three persons

and one god

in the same first article is oppugned the omnipotency of god almighty by beza

vvhitaker others who affirme
that god cannot place one body in two places by replication or other wayes that is christs body in heauen and on the altar at the same time

that god cannot place two bodies in one place by penetration one of another that is that christs body with the stone of the sepulcher at his resurrection with the dores of the house at the entring to his disciples and with the solidity of the heauens at his ascensio could not be togeather in one place but the stone dores or heauen were diuided opened or resolued into some liquid matter

that god cannot draw a camell or a as it is said in the ghospell though a needles eye

that god hath no absolute power to do any more then he hath already done

that the position of the archangell gabriel any word is not impossible with god is not generally to be belieued nor vniuersally to be admitted
al which if they be true that is if the diuinity be passible be a mediatour be a priest and be three and distinct as the person are if god be the authour and worker of all sinne and euill if the word trinity and the prayer holy trinity haue mercy on vs be to be left out as barbarous foolish and dangerous if god cannot place one body in two places or two bodies in one place cannot draw a through a needles eyes can do no more then he hath done then is the deity the vnity the trinity the goodnes and the omnipote~cy of god all which are by this first article belieued by this doctrine and these doctours oppugned and so the fayth of the first article reiected

secondly in the second article attributed to iohn is oppugned the worke of the whole trinity

the creation of heauen and earth
by caluin who will haue only the father properly to be creatour of heauen and earth as to whome alone the name of god by excellency is due and the sonne to be the vicar of the father and to haue the second degree of honour after him

by stenberge seruetus blandrata somarus francus others cyted

by kellison who deny the diuinity of the holy ghost

as the third person in the trinity and admit only a vertue from the father which they call the holy ghost
but if the father be only god if the sonne be inferiour as his vicar and second to him if the holy ghost be only the vertue of the father not a person distinct from him then is only the father and not the sonne and the holy ghost with the whole trinity the creatour of heauen and earth
wherby the second article is oppugned

thirdly in the third article attributed to iames the greater is oppugned the diuinity of the sonne second person iesus christ his only sonne our lord

by luther who detested the word undefined span alphabet or consubsta~tiall signifying the sonne to be of the same substance with the father and made the diuinity of the sonne passible with eutiches

as haue shewed before

by caluin beza and whitaker who admit christ to be sonne of the father but not to be god of the father

or of the essence of the father or god of god as the nicene creed expresseth but god of himselfe and withall affirmes that the father doth not continually eternally beget the sonne

by caluin beza others before cited who make christ as god a mediatour and priest and both to pray and to be obedient to the father and distinguish in him a person of god distinct from the person of a mediatour and therby with nestorius make him to haue two persons
all which if it be true that is if the sonne or second person as god be not co~substantiall with the father if he be not god of god

if he be passible the vicar and second after the father if he be a mediatour and priest obedient to the father if he haue two persons then is he not god coequall and coeternall

and the same in substance with the father nor one only sonne of god but two persons
and so this third article

iesus christ his only sonne our lord is oppugned

fourthly in the fourth article attributed to andrew is oppugned the humanity of christ and virginity of his mother vvho was conceiued by the holy ghost borne of the virgin mary

by the vbiquitarians who make the humanity to haue omnipotency immensity all the properties of the deity

so to do all to be all where and in all places which is proper

to a diuine

not humane nature

by the anabaptists and others who make christ to haue passed through the body of his mother as water doth through a conduct and not to haue taken flesh of her womb
by molineus bucer beza willet and others who affirme our lady to haue suffered detriment of her virginity in the birth of our sauiour and so make christ not to be borne of a virgin which this article affirmes

fiftly in the fifth article attributed to philip is oppugned the vertue of the death and passion of christ who suffered vnder pontius pilate was crucified dead and buried
and that many wayes

in that the vertue of his passio is not according to them generall for al sinners and wicked persons but particuler only for a few elect

that is for some certaine protesta~ts of some one sect who only are the faithful among them leauing all the rest destitut of any vertue from it or of any vocation or iustification by meanes of it

in that those elect it cures not from sinne but only couers their sinne remits not sinne but only imputes it not washes not away the guilt or offence of sin but only frees them from the punishment due to it and enables not a man to resist sinne but permits him in euery action to sinne strengthens him not to keep any one commandement but leaues him so that he must needes breake all

in that it giues to the soule of ma neither any life of grace by which it raises him from spirituall death to life nor any inherent iustice by which it makes him iust before god cleane from any sinne or solid in any perfection of vertue piety and good life nor any vertue by which it enables him to do any good worke to satisfy for any offence or to merit any reward of glory or increase of grace nor any inward vnction by which it adopts him to be and to be called the sonne of god or to be inheritour of the kingdome of heauen

it had in christ as it was endured and offered by him no dignity from his diuine person which did giue an infinit valew and worth to euery action it had no vertue or validity to satisfy gods iustice for any sin to pay a price sufficient equiualent for any sinne it could not by all the paines and torments which christ suffered in

body euen to the sheding of the last droppe of his bloud auaile any thing for mans redemption except he had suffered in soule also
it could not redeeme man from any sinne except christ besides had suffered all the paines due to sinne euen the same torments of hell which any damned doth suffer for sin
it so far ouercame christ that it made him troubled inconsiderate abrupt effeminate doubtfull of gods fauour and forgetfull of his office of a redeemer
it made him wauering staggering desperate renouncing his saluation
it tormented him with horrour of conscience with anxiety of mind with sense of gods wrath and with feeling of the sorrowes paines and torments of eternall death and hell
all which as it is their doctrine of the death and passion of christ in their owne particuler wordes before cyted so it derogates from the vertue of christs bloud the dignity of his passion and is dishonourable sacrilegious and blasphemous to his person and in all oppugnes this article of christs suffering vnder pontius pilate
all which is contrary in our catholike doctrine as shal afterward be shewed which attributes to the vertue and passion of christ that dignity validity and vertue that euery action any passion the least drop of his bloud was sufficient superaboundant to haue pacified gods wrath satisfyed his iustice paid the price of sinne redeemed from sinne hell all the world and infinit worlds more and that it did de facto merit for all men inward grace to wash away remit the guilt of sinne to giue life and beauty to the soule to adopt it to the title of the sonne of god that it did giue strength to man to resist sinne before it be committed and satisfy for it in some sort after it be committed to keep gods commandme~ts to merit a reward at gods handes
of which doctrine whether doth giue more honour vertue to the death passion of christ his suffering vnder pontius pilate for vs

let the indifferent reader be iudge

sixthly in the sixth article attributed to thomas is oppugned both the descension of christ into hell his resurrection from the dead he descended into hell and the third day rose againe from the dead
and first his reall descending in

soule to limbus patrum to free the fathers there and make them blessed or which is propable to the place of the damned also not to suffer but to confound the diuell shew his maiesty is oppugned

by those who deny that any limbus patrum was euer at all and affirme that the soules of the dead patriarches were locally in heauen though not beatifically blessed by the sight of god before christ as

caluin

beza

by those who deny that as yet there is any locall place of hell at all or any reall fire and torments of the damned there as

luther

bucer

brentius

lobecius

perkins

vvillet

caluin the deuines of heidelberge

by those who deny his descension to haue been either in body or soule substantially but only in vertue and effect meritoriously in that he merited the freedome both of the patriarches before him and of vs after him from the paines of hell as bullinger zuinglius the diuines of vvittemberge and others

by those who affirme his descension to hell to haue beene only in body not in soule and that not to the lowest hell but only to the graue or buriall and so act

thou shalt not leaue my soule in hell they change soule into carkasse and hell into graue translating it thou shalt not leaue my carkasse in the graue as beza and bucer

by those who admit his descension to haue beene in soule but yet suffering the very paines of hell and of the damned either after his death in hell

as luther gerlachius and some other mentioned by beza or before his death in the garden and vpon the crosse as caluin vvillet and others before cited

by those who question this article as suspected to haue beene intruded into the creed after it was made as caluin
all which opinions as they either deny any limbus patrum to haue euer beene or any reall torments of hell as yet to be or as they affirme christ to haue descended only in vertue and merit not in body or soule or only in body to the graue or in soule to suffer the paines of hell either after death in hel or before death vpon the crosse and in the garden are all contrary to this part of this article in which is affirmed christs descending into hell that is in soule to limbus to free the fathers and patriarches there and to carry them with him into heauen

secondly his resurrection from the dead in the same article is oppugned

by those who according to beza

deny all resurrection as yet of christs body more then of other mens
by the vbiquitarians

who affirme his body to haue had immensity and therby to haue beene euery where in all places euer after his incarnation

by caluin beza and other who deny his resurrection with the guift of subtility or penetration and affirme that his body could not pierce through the stone of the sepulcher or enter the doors to his disciples without either the remouing or altering of the nature of the dores and stone by resoluing them into some liquid matter

by caluin and others who deny the rysing againe of his bloud that was shed vpon the crosse

thereby the resurrection of his whole and entire body
all which as they deny either any resurrection at all or the complete resurrection of christs body or the resurrection of the same with subtilty or penetration do euery one oppugne this article of christs resurrection from the dead in such due sense as it ought to be belieued

seauenthly in the seauenth article attributed to bartholomew is oppugned both the ascending of christ to heauen

and his sitting at the right hand of god the father by power and dignity equall to him in person and excelling all creatures in his humane nature

by the vbiquitarians who by the of christs body in euery place take from it all possibility of ascending to a new place

by caluin who by giuing to christ a power not equall with god

but vicary or deputary to him and an honour not the same but only second in degree to christ after god the father by denying al situatio either of sitting or standing of christs body in heauen doth oppose both his ascension and sitting at the right hand of god

by the same caluin and others who deny all ascension through the heauens by way of penetration and admit it only by diuision and by cutting off the heauens

by those who yield the patriarches a priority and deny christ the primacy of tyme in ascending to heaue
all which as they either affirme an euery where presence of christs body or a difference of honour christ as

god and god the father or as they deny either any penetration of christs body through the heauens or any priority of his ascending before other soules are all opposite to the manner of christs ascension and sitting at the right hand of god in glory

eightly in the eight article attributed to matthew is oppugned the co~ming of christ to iudge the quicke and the dead by their generall doctrine that god is authour and worker of all sinnes that the commandements of god are impossible that man hath no freewill that there is no reward for good deedes that all sinnes be mortall and damnable
for these supposed no way is left to discusse rightly the differe~ce of sinnes to punish iustly mens sinnes or to reward duly their good deeds

ninthly in the ninth article attributed to iames the lesser is oppugned the beliefe of the holy ghost and of the catholicke church both which augustine makes one article
of the holy ghost in that some as hath been shewed make it only the vertue not the substance of god others expung it out of their letanies
others as the geneuians deny the adoration of it
others as before do make it the authour worker of all sinne the sauiour of all sects who by a perswasion they co~ceiue of it

do euery one assure themselues of saluation which authority reason and experience conuince to be false
of the holy catholicke church in that some reiect the name catholicke as vaine and change it into christian others leaue it wholy out of the creed as superfluous and all of them do generally affirme the church for many ages to haue beene latent inuisible erroneous adulterous and antichristian without either head to gouerne it or authority to end any controuersies and to conserue vnity or to punish offenders in it and without any sanctity in the professours of it whom they make all to be sinners and that in all sinnes generally and in great sins mortally then how can such a church be truely holy vniuersall and infallible in deciding the beliefe of articles determination of controuersies

tenthly in the tenth article attributed to simon is oppugned the communion of saints and forgiuenesse of sinnes
the

communion of saints is oppugned


the communion of saints in earth one with another by denying all meanes of vnity in faith vnder one head and iudge

the communion of saints in earth with the soules in purgatory by denying all prayer for the dead

the communion of saints in earth with the saints in heauen by denying all honour or praying by vs vnto them and all knowledge and praying by them either for vs in earth or others in purgatory
the remission of sinnes is oppugned by denying al power of priesthood in gods church to pronounce any sentence of absolution all vertue in sacraments to haue any operation as instruments in the remitting of sinne all infusion of grace to blot out and wash away all vncleannesse and deformity of any sinne either originall or actuall which according to them are neuer remitted or taken away but only couered and not imputed

eleuenthly in the eleauenth article attributed to iudas thaddaeus is oppugned the resurrection of the body by all who before oppugned the resurrection of christs body and by many who now a dayes euen in england admit a resurrection in a like body but not in the same body which was before

twelthly in the twelth article attributed matthias

is oppugned the life euerlasting

by luther who one while affirmes that the soule is made by propagatio ex traduce not by creation and that the immortality of it is a popish fiction out of the dunghill of the popes decrees anotherwhile

that the soules of the iust of many damned do sleepe senselesse vntill the day of iudgment and that dogges sheep oxen and fishes shalbe in heauen for our recreation


by caluin who affirmes that the soules of the blessed remaine sleeping in the porch are not as yet entred into the kingdome of glory that faith is remaining in heauen that it is foolish temerarious to enquire where the soules of the iust are and whether as yet they be in glory or not
all which many such like opinions of theirs as they are the inuention of this priuate spirit and are both absurd wicked or blasphemous so are they all plaine contrary to the apostles creed and do directly oppugne the articles of it
and thus much of this priuate spirits doctrine as it

oppugneth the articles of the creed and in them all faith and beliefe

of absurdities against prayer and the pater noster
sect
vii
svbdiv

in generall making all prayer needlesse or hopelesse

secondly this doctrine oppugneth the petitions of the pater noster and all manner of prayer and deuotion to god for which we may note that as by faith we come to know god and his reuealed verities so by this hope we are animated to attaine to the fruition of god all that is good for vs
an effect of this hope is prayer by which we are emboldened in hope to obteine to speake to god and aske of him what we stand in need of
prayer therfore as it is according to augustine an eleuating of the mind and a sacrifice to god a reliefe to man a terrour to sathan a safegard to the soule a comfort to the angells the perfect glory the certaine hope and incorrupted preseruer of all religion as it is an incense mou~ting vp to heauen a messenger we se~d to god where our selues cannot yet come a ladder by which we climbe to the throne of god and god descends to our vale of misery a hand which we reach to heauen which god returnes filled with benedictio~s to vs againe so it is not only a speciall vertue commended vnto vs by christ who wils vs to pray and to pray often yea without intermission but also a chiefe practise the particulars wherof christ himselfe did deliuer to vs both for the matter what and the ma~ner how we should pray and make our petition
this he did in the pater noster and the seauen petitions of it which being a compendium of all we are to aske as the creed is of all we are to belieue we make in it besides the preparatory preface which teaches vs to haue confidence in god in that he is to vs not only a maister but a father charity to our brethre

in that he is our father and we all brethren his children by creation and adoption and a reuerence both to gods maiesty as residing in heauen and also to his saints and seruants in whom specially as in the heauens he dwels and reignes by grace as augustine expounds it besides say this preface or preparation we make seauen petitions of seauen seuerall things vnto god in which we desire blessings at gods hands

either positiue of good things to be obtained or preseruatiue from euill things to be auoided
the positiue blessings we craue are either spirituall or corporall the spirituall are
the sanctification of gods name in the first petition that is either true knowledge of him or right honour to him or constant perseuerance in him

the coming of his kingdome in the second that is the dilatation of his church on earth the increase of his grace in our harts the obteining of his glory in heauen

the obedience to his will in earth as it is in heauen in the third that is as gods will is done by angells so it may be done by man as it is done by the iust so it may by sinners as it is wrought in the spirit so it may be in the flesh
the corporall blessings we craue are our dayly bread in the fourth that is either temporall food for the body or doctrinall for knowledge of the vnderstanding or sacramentall of the eucharist and whatsoeuer is conuenient for both soule body these are the four first petitions of positiue blessings
the preseruatiue blessings are from euils from which we desire to be freed those either euils past as sin forgiue vs our trespasses in the fifth against god our neighbours or ourselus by commissio or omission by thought word or deed or euils present lead vs not into te~ptation in the sixt that is permit vs not to fall into any occasion or danger of sin by concupiscence of the flesh vanity of the world and malice of the diuell or euils to come deliuer vs from euill in the seauenth that is from all paine due to sinne originall or actuall by affliction in this life or by torments in the next life either in purgatory or in hell and from whatsoeuer may hinder vs from god and all goodnes in this or the next life
in which are summarily con+tained all the thinges pertaining to the honour of god or necessary for our body or soules in this life or the next

it remaines to shew that the former positions of the protestants do make all these petitions needlesse

or fruitlesse needlesse as of thinges certaine which need to be asked fruitlesse as of thinges impossible which cannot be obtained which is shewed two wayes first in generall of all prayer secondly in particuler of these petitions
in generall thus
that prayer is needlesse which prayes for that which is certaine cannot faile vs as either already past or assuredly possest or to come as for example that christ should be borne or crucifyed which is past or that should be a man or an english man which am sure am or that to morrow the sunne should ryse or that men should rise at the day of iudgment which they are sure to do
againe that prayer is fruitles which prayes for that which is impossible to be had as for a mother to pray that she were a maid and virgin againe or for that an old man to pray that he were young againe and might neuer dye both which are impossible though not both equally
but according to the protestant grounds such are generally all their prayers for if they pray for remission of sins for the fauour of god for perseuerance in fayth or for the glory of heauen their prayer is as needlesse as to pray for the birth of christ past or for the day of iudgment to come because euery one by his speciall faith belieues as certainly that his sinnes are forgiuen him as by his generall fayth that christ was crucified for him as assuredly that he shall perseuer in fayth and come to heauen as that there shalbe a day of iudgment and resurrection of his body therefore prayer for the one is as needlesse as for the other
againe if they pray for gods grace to wash them from sin to keep gods commandements to auoid concupiscence and lust and to loue god aboue all and not to offend him their prayer is as fruitlesse as to pray for gods grace to keep them euer being sicke or euer dying or to leape ouer the sea or fly to the starres because according to them the one is as impossible as the other therefore as hopelesse to be obtained by prayer as the other

to pray for the preuenting of any euil whether it be malum culpae as sinne or malum poenae as punishment and whether it be punishment temporall as losse

of goods affliction of body or death of friends or spirituall as losse of fayth of gods fauour and of the ioyes of heauen or to pray for the obtayning of any good either temporal as riches health or the life of friends or spirituall as the good of gods church the remission of our sinnes and our perseuerance in state of grace or obtaining the kingdome of heauen is both needlesse and fruitlesse because all as well euill as good shall infallibly fall out as god hath according to his owne irrespectiue immutable ineuitable will pleasure decreed and appointed it therefore needlesse it is to pray for the obtaining of good and fruitlesse to pray for the preuenting of euill because both must fall certainly as god hath ordained decreed
what end or vse therfore is there of prayer since the euent and the effect will be the same as well without prayer as with prayer all as god without any respect or foreseene consideration of vs or our deserts or prayers or other works hath according to his owne absolute will decreed and appointed to happen to vs

thirdly willingly to do any act which is belieued and supposed to be a sinne

and that mortall deseruing eternall damnation is vnlawfull sinnefull and damnable and so not to be done with a good conscience but such is all prayer euen the best and deuoutest we can vse according to their principles because euery worke euen the good workes of the best persons according to luther illyricus caluin beza paraeus vvhitaker tindall and others are sinnes

mortall sinnnes damnable sinnes and nothing but sinne euen in the iust and elect though no more imputed to them then their bad workes of adultery murder which they say are not at al imputed to them
therefore all prayer how good or deuout soeuer is a sinne and that mortall and damnable so is vnlawfull sinnefull and damnable and not to be vsed more then swearing lying drinking both being sinnes and neither imputed punished as sinnes in the elect in whome they are couered and both imputed and punished as sinne in the reprobate in whome they are neuer forgiuen
all which is confirmed diuers wayes by the expresse wordes first of luther who affirmes
that no man obtaines any thing

at gods hand for any dignity either in his prayer or in himselfe but only by the bounty of god

also which he constantly auouches that the iust man doth sinne euen in praying according to that of dauid
let his prayer be a sinne

by the wordes of illyricus who affirmes that prayer is no good worke but a begging of wages
and of bucer

and caluin his scholler who both affirme that christ did not prescribe vs to pray in these very wordes of the pater noster but shewed to what end

and with what affection we should pray

by the practise of many precisians or familists in england witnesse smyth who vse to protest they will rather dye then say the lords prayer

by the practise of the purer forte of protestants

who haue left off condemne all saying of canonicall houres and deuotion in the church haue not only turned all publicke praying into preaching neuer vsing any at all in their meetings but also did for example in france pull downe destroy witnesse in one six monthes no fewer then ten thousand houses of prayer

or churches in
citties which they by rebellion kept fro their soueraigne king and prince
by all which is apparent not only how little they esteeme either prayer or houses of prayer but also that according to their grounds all prayer in generall is needlesse and fruitlesse yea sinnefull and damnable and so not to be vsed and practised

svbdiv

in particuler opposing all the seauen petitions of the pater noster

in particuler that by this doctrine is oppugned all euery part and petition of the pater noster shall likewise be proued
for first in the preparation our father which art in heauen

how can they call or esteeme him a louing father whome they belieue to be a cruell and vniust iudge who decreed and created them to sinne that for that he might damne them or what confidence can they haue in the mercy of this father who is thus rigorous to them in his iustice· and more then iustice how can they call or esteeme themselues his children by adoption from whome they receaue

no inward grace of iustification how can they call him our father or the father of all whome they belieue as a father to haue predestinated called and giuen meanes only to a few and as a cruell iudge to haue excluded all the rest and the greatest part of which euery one may iustly feare himselfe to be one from any possibility of vocation grace or saluation how can they expect from him a crowne of glory in heauen of whome they belieue they cannot merit any reward in earth why should they not feare a heauy hand of iustice yea despaire of any kind of mercy from him who beyond iustice hath proceeded so terribly as to predestinate so many to so great paines as are the paines of hell who had deserued or giuen no cause of any paines at all who can imagine that god dwelleth in the iust and elect as in the heauens who are so fowly stayned in euery part of their soule with the deformity of all sinne and iniquity that no one part or action of them is cleare and vnstained from sinne surely they who belieue this of god and his cruelty and of man and his deformity cannot confidently say neither our father which imports gods mercy to man mans confidence in god or vvhich art in heauen which specifyes that as god dwels in the iust so they as the temple of god should be pure and cleane and bright like to heauen

secondly how can they in the first petition say hallowed be thy name and hope that they by true loue honour

and obedience to god can sanctify and make holy his name by their life and actions who belieue that euery action they do euen the best they can do is a sinne and that mortall damnable surely to pray that by actions which are prophane we may sanctify gods name that by workes which are offences to god we may please god that by deedes which are damnable and deserue hell we may prayse god and deserue heauen is a prayer not only so hoplesse as it is not possible but also senslesse that no reasonable man can be imagined to make it

thirdly how can they wih confidence say thy kingdome come that is

that christ may raigne as a king either in his church by fayth or in the faythfull by grace or in heaue

by glory who belieue and professe that christ was not able to preserue his church for so many ages togeather without errour of antichristianity and idolatry no not so much as in extancy or visibility nor yet hath power by grace so to raigne in any his seruants as to maister any sin or temptation to sin or to performe any one commandement or to do any one action which is iust and not sinnefull
surely weake is that king poore is that kingdome where neither the king hath power to protect his subiects from the inuasion of the enemy nor the subiect hath ability to performe any action which may tend to the honour and seruice of the king
againe what needes any man to pray that either christ may raigne in him by grace present or that he may raigne with christ in glory to come who is certaine and sure by his speciall fayth as all protestants say they are that both he is for the present in state of gods fauour and also shalbe for the future in state of glory in heauen surely he that belieues this needs not to pray either for pardon of sinnes which he is sure are pardoned or for his obtaining heauen which he is sure to obtaine

fourthly how can any one in the third petition say thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen vnderstanding that gods will should by vs be performed in doing good deedes and auoiding bad that we should conforme our selues to the will of god both in the materiall obiect by doing that which he will haue done and in the formall by doing it both for the end and after the manner as he will haue it done who belieues
that man hath no freedome or power to worke the will of god

that gods will is wrought in euery action as well bad as good

that the will of god in performing his commandements is impossible

that good workes in this life are neither meritorious nor necessary nor yet possible

that in earth euery man and euery action of his is sinnefull and vncleane and in heauen euery saint angell and euery action of theirs is good pure and perfect
for as it is needlesse to pray that gods will be performed which ineuitably shalbe performed both in good and bad actions in which man hath no liberty or power so it is bootlesse

to pray that men may either be freed from sinne or may do good workes or may fullfill gods commandements or may do his will in earth as saints and angels do it in heaue because according to their beliefe all this in this life is impossible and neither euer was nor euer shalbe by any at any tyme performed
in vaine therefore is it for vs to pray that we may conforme our selues to the will of god either in the affirmatiue precept in doing that which he commaunds or in the negatiue precept in omitting that which he forbids either in the materiall obiect in doing what he commands or in the formall in doing how and why he commands sith both and all are either necessary and so must be done or impossible and so cannot be done

fifthly how can any man say giue vs our dayly bread

vnderstanding either of temporall sustenance for the reliefe of the body or of sacramentall food the body and bloud of christ who belieues either that the decree will and ordinance of god doth impose an infallible and an ineuitable necessity vpon all things whereby all thinges necessary wilbe prouided for vs as god hath ordayned without our prayer or that the eucharist is not the true body and bloud of christ but only a figure or signe of it because the beliefe of the former takes away all necessity of praying for temporall sustenance and the misbeliefe of the latter opposes all desire of the supersubstantiall bread of the body of christ in the eucharist

sixthly how can any man with confidence say forgiue vs our trespasses as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs

vnderstanding by trespasses his debts or sinnes by forgiue remit or take away the same
for if fayth be precedent and presupposed to prayer as it is for els how can we as we ought with fayth and confidence aske and pray and the same faith as they say doth assure vs by a certaine and infallible perswasion that our sinnes are already forgiuen or not imputed then surely in vaine needlesse yea foolish is our petition to haue them remitted or not imputed

if euery good worke be a sinne as they defend and that mortall then by sinne and that mortall such as is the saying though neuer so deuoutly

of this prayer and petition is sinne remitted and so comitting of sinne should be a meanes to obtaine remissio of sinne which is most absurd as though the committing of a new offence should be a motiue to pardon the old

if no sinne be remitted in this life but only couered and not imputed then in vaine and hoplesse is our prayer for remission and taking away our sinnes as of a thing impossible and needlesse and bootlesse is our prayer for the not imputation of the same because as before in the elect they are already not imputed in the reprobate they neuer shalbe imputed either therefore fruitlesse and hopelesse as a thing impossible is the remitting and taking away of our sinnes or needlesse fearelesse as a thing certaine is the not imputation of the same by this petition demanded sith the one is impossible to be obtained and the other is certainly already possessed and enioyed needlesse therefore or hopelesse is this petition of forgiuenes of our sinnes by their principles

seauenthly how can any man with confidence in the sixt petition say lead vs not into temptation that is into no danger or occasion of sinne into no consent or act of sinne to to come who belieues
that god wills and workes all sinnes and occasions of sinnes

that as he hath already decreed so euery action and occasion must be

that by no sinne he can fall from fayth or grace or loose heauen for if all sinne be ineuitably determined then it shall infallibly be wrought by god as he hath determined
and if euery actio in man be a sinne then impossible it is to be freed from it so hopelesse is the praying for that end
and if no sinne can hurt a faythfull christian nor hinder him of heauen or depriue him of grace then in vaine needlesse is all prayer to be freed from temptation to sinne which can neither hurt nor hinder any faythfull person from heauen
in vaine therfore and to no end or benefit is the saying of this sixth petition lead vs not into temptation

eightly how can any man with confidence say the seauenth petition deliuer vs from euill vnderstanding it of the paines and punishments of sinne or impediments of good thinges

to be inflicted either in this life or in the next

who belieues that no temporall punishment either in this or the next life remaines to be endured after the guilt of sin be remitted and that all paine or miserie inflicted by the diuell or man is from god the diuell and man being only instruments and that forced necessitated to it
for where no punishment remaines as due either in purgatory which they belieue not or in this life in which only fayth satisfyes and remits where also the ineuitable decree and hand of god doth will and worke all punishment in body or goods and where all things do fall out infallible as god hath disposed there all prayer to preuent punishments for sinnes or to remoue impediments of good thinges is both needlesse because as well without as with prayer the euent must fall as god hath disposed and also fruitlesse because by it no punishment of sinne or impediment of good thinges ordained by god can be preuented
to what end or with what confidence therfore can any who belieues the former doctrine say these petitions of the pater noster sith by vertue of it all prayer in generall and this of the pater noster in particuler is made either needlesse as of things which are certaine to succeed without it or hopelesse as of things which are impossible to haue any effect by it and thus is shewed how the protestant doctrine is opposite to all hope and doth make frustrate all manner of prayer by which we come with any confidence to obtaine at gods handes any benefit for vs or remoue any euill from vs

of absurdities against the obseruation of all lawes and chiefly of the ten commandements
sect
viii
svbdiv

in generall how all lawes are made impossible and not obliging

we haue shewed how the protestant doctrine ouerthroweth the articles of the creed and the petitions

of the pater noster and in them all certainty of fayth all exercise of hope by making of prayer

it remaines that we shew how it likewise frustrates all precepts lawes which tend to good life by bidding good and forbidding euill and among them in particuler the decalogue of the ten commandements and thereby openeth the gappe and looseth the reines to all liberty of sinne and loosenesse of life to the ruine of charity
for which we may note
that lawes which euer haue beene at all tymes among al nations

vsed as the chiefe meanes to withdraw men from euill and to prepare them to good by punishing the one and rewarding the other haue alwayes by wise men beene esteemed of that dignity and necessity that according to pindarus they are the inuention and guift of god according to chrysippus

that they are very god himselfe who giues them the queene of all actions diuine and humane
according to aristotle they are the rule of iustice and iniustice which we must apply to all actions and by which all businesses and persons are ruled the measure by which we must square what we are to do and what to omit the prince whome we ought to obey

and the captaine whome it is fit to follow
according to tully they are the establishing of right the suppression of wrong
according to demosthenes the sinewes of the citty and the strength of it against the wicked
without which sayth plato

a is not a
and according to which if men did not liue they would nothing differ from beasts

these lawes are some naturall of reason

and a mans conscience some positiue diuine of god which were established either by moyses in the old law and were either morall ceremoniall or iudiciall or by christ and his apostles in the new law and are yet of fayth and sacraments charity or good life some humane which are either canonicall of the church or ciuill for all nations or particuler of seuerall countryes all which being iust promulgated and knowne do oblige and that in conscience vnder sinne to the performance of them

among these lawes the chiefest and most in force are the decalogue or the ten commandments which being lawes morall of good manners and agreable to naturall reasons are not with the ceremoniall

and iudiciall law which were giuen only for that tyme and estate of the law of moyses abrogated but stand still in force

and oblige all men and nations to the performance

in these ten commandements we are commanded to performe our duty to god in the first table and to our neighbour in the second table
to god first honour in our hart by adoring one not many gods in the first commandement

reuerence in word in not prophaning his name by vaine swearing in the second

obedience in fact by keeping his sabboth and festiuall day in the third

to our neighbour we are to giue by affirmatiue precept honour to our parents and superiours in the fourth and by negatiue precept to auoid al wrongs done to our neighbour
by exteriour fact either to his own selfe by killing in the fifth or to his second selfe his wife by adultery in the sixth or to his goods by stealing in the seauenth

in word by false witnesse in the eight

in hart by vnlawful desiring either his wife by concupiscence in the ninth or his goodes by auarice in the tenth commandment
which decalogue of ten commandments doth oblige to performance not only christians who professe the name fayth of christ but also all sortes of men or women endewed with reason whether iewes turkes pagans or whomesoeuer

now that the protestants by their doctrine do abrogate all these lawes not only of church or but also of god of nature of the ten commandments and whatsoeuer leaue man obliged to the performance of none but by the liberty of their ghospell freed from all as hauing it in their free choice whether they wil keep or break any commandement of god church or king and that they do thereby draw backe from the practise of any vertue draw forward to the practise of vice and so remoue al encouragement to vertue and propose all enticements to vice by which they do open a wide gap to all liberty and loosenesse of life and giue a free passage to all concupiscence and sensuality of sinne to what any mans imagination or affection shall lead him that this their doctrine say doth this shall by these and the former positions and illations

vpon them be conuinced

for first they take away from the all superiority by affirming that among christians is no superiour that a christian is subiect to none but only to christ who only is his immediate superiour as

luther

they take away from superiours all spirituall and temporall power to make any lawes affirming as

luther

caluin do that to make lawes and to rule by lawes is proper only to god that no man can forbid that which is not forbid by christ

that they take from lawes all obligation to bind in conscience affirming all as

luther caluin zuinglius beza martyr danaeus vvhitaker perkins others do that no magistrate or lawes are to be obeyed for conscience that all lawes of men are to be abolished that the laws of the apostles oblige not but for scandall that there is no sinne or obligation in conscience to any law but of god

they derogate from gods lawes holding that it is impossible for any man though iust to performe and satisfy the law or to keep the commandements or any one of them that therefore the law commands thinges impossible which is a fundamentall point of christian religion to be belieued and that the contrary which affirmes the keeping of the law to be possible and the gayning of heauen to be proposed co~ditionally if we keep the law is a wicked perswasion
so the confession

of auspurge and england so luther melancthou caluin beza danaeus vvhitaker perkins scharpius adaemus francisci and others

they abolish the morall law of

the decalogue or ten commandements affirming that it is free and nothing belongs to any iust regenerate and pious person that the breach of it to any faythfull shall not be imputed as a sinne nor punished as a sinne thus

luther melancthon zuinglius martyr caluin beza vvhitak
tindaell bucan
bullinger and others whereupon they inferre that the obseruation of the law is not necessary to saluation thus

luther caluin perkins piscator paraeus and martyr that no saint as yet euer did fullfill the law and obey it nor loue god with his whole hart as the law requires thus the

confessions of auspurge scotland and bohemia luther caluin brentius paraeus danaeus others
and that we should not vse any prayer for that end that we may fulfill the law but only that we may endeauour to fullfill it thus

caluin perkins and others doe affirme
to which assertions if we adde their other positions before mentioned

about good works that they are not pleasing to god as any worship to him but are all sinnes that mortall and neither free nor meritorious nor necessary nor profitable nor possible nor any cause of saluation therfore can haue no dignity no merit no reward no crowne of iustice

about sin that god wils works and is pleased with sinne doth predestinate command tempt necessitate to sinne that no sinne is imputed to the elect that no sinne can be auoided that no sinne is any cause of damnation

about iustification that only faith doth iustify that by assuring a man of his iustification which once had can neuer be lost that no iustice is inherent but all imputed that none doth take away any sinne but only couer it that none doth make a man iust before god but only before man
if say

we adde these their positions and doctrine which are their common tenents and before proued to the former it will euidently appeare that their doctrine of it selfe without any wresting or forcing it is a spurre to vice and a bridle to vertue is a retractiue from good life and an attractiue to bad doth stope the way to a mind enclined to morall honesty open the gat to one disposed to loosnesse and liberty

svbdiv

in particular how many wayes the protestant doctrine incourageth to the breach of all lawes and to all lewdnes of life
and first if a man should belieue not only the articles and points reuealed in scripture but also the consequences deduced from them as most protestants hould the may euery protestant out of these their former principles by euident consequence deduced belieue and practise these such like positions and practises which draw from all piety to impurity and which do euidently follow out of the former principles

first therfore he may reason and accordingly practise thus the obseruation of the ten commandments yea of any one is impossible and by the liberty of the ghospell am freed from all obligation to any as well morall as ceremoniall precepts ergo in vaine do labour to keepe them in vaine do e~deauour to abstaine from idolatry periury prophaning the sabboth disobedience to superiours murder adultery theft false witnesse concupiscence or the like because it is as impossible for me to keepe the as for me to leap ouer the sea because by the liberty of the gospel am freed from the obligation as well of them as of the ceremonial precepts and therfore may as well breake the sunday as the saturday as well commit fornication as eat porke or bacon as well omit duty to parents or princes as circumcision or the paschall lambe sith all are equally abrogated and neither sinne nor punishment of either is imputed ergo why shall not as well commit as auoid swearing drinking murder

adultery or the rest why not as well yield to as resist concupiscence why not as well consent as dissent as well follow as forbeare my pleasures as well feed as bridle my appetites and passions because both are against the comma~mandement which is impossible to be kept and neither imputed to me for sinne which by faith is fully remitted

secondly he may reason

and accordingly practise thus no prince or prelate hath any power to make lawes which shall oblige the subiect in conscience ergo am not bound in conscience and vnder any sinne to obey them but may so as publicke scandall or punishme~t can be auoided breake them at my pleasure so it be priuate and vnknowne therfore may vnderhand breake the canons iniunctions of the church and vse simony bribery and the rest therfore need not obserue the lawes of the commo wealth but may bring in or trasport forbidden goods deny tolles taxes or imposts breake any statute either as a magistrate or as a subiect so can auoid scandall and punishment because vnder sinne and in conscience am obliged to none of these lawes and statutes

thirdly he may reason and practise thus

no good works are meritorious none are necessary none are possible all euen the best being sins and that mortall as infected with originall sinne and defectiue from the law ergo in vaine do labour to do good works which are impossible in vaine do labour to serue and please god by them sith al are sinnes and that mortall why therfore shall do rather good workes then bad why liue piously rather then wickedly why do iustice rather then iniustice make restitution rather then commit rapine vse praying rather then swearing frequent sermons rather then tauerns because neither the one nor the other deserue reward or are pleasing to god and both the one and the other are damnable sinnes and deserue hell but neither are imputed as sinnes but both couered by the iustice of christ apprehended by my faith

fourthly he may reason and practise thus

only faith doth iustify iustifying doth infallibly make me as certaine of remission of my sinnes as am of christs death and therby

certaine of my perdestination and election for none are truly faithfull and iustified but the elect and certaine also of my perseuerance and glorification for faith once had cannot be lost what then need to feare either for seruil feare any punishment of hell because am sure of heauen or for filiall feare any offence of god because am sure that he imputes no sinne or offence to me and that neither he will forsake me nor can fall from him or for reuerentiall feare any maiesty and goodnesse of god who wil not be offended for that which is wild wrought by himselfe and because his lawes or precepts are aboue my power and as impossible do not oblige in conscience what need to make any conscience of any sinne either past or committed or to come and in danger to be committed because am sure that none shalbe imputed that none can take from me gods grace and fauour that all by faith are couered and that my baptisme was to me a signe and seale of remissio of al sinnes past and to come what need either contrition or sorrow either pennance or satisfaction either fasting or good workes either prayer or preaching because am sure that all satisfaction is made for me by christ that any sinne of myne is impossible that also my prayer penance are sinnes that my sinnes are already forgiuen that am certainly the sonne of god and so certaine to continue and to come to heauen

fiftly he may reason and practise thus haue no or liberty either of contradiction to do or not to do or of specification to do good or bad but am by the decree and will of god necessitated to do what do what god hath ordeined me to do ergo vnreasonable is god who hath imposed vpon me precepts which haue no power or freedome to performe vniust is god who punishes me for doing that which he wils me to do in which haue no freedome of wil to the contrary impious are magistrats and iudges who punish me for that which god wils co~mands compels me to do impossible is all vertue and vice in me which can be no more vertue or vice in me then in a beast if want freedome of will foolish am who labour to do that which haue no power or liberty to do
in vaine do either lawes

terrify me or superiours admonish me or preachers me to that which haue no power liberty or freedome to omit or commit to choose or refuse
all which followes vpon the want of my freewill and ability to do good

sixtly he may reason and practise thus god hath decreed appointed and predestinated of his owne meere wi

without any respect to me or my demerit whether shalbe damned or saued the one or other as he hath appointed in vaine therefore am solicitous or do labour for either sith without my care or labour that must be which god hath appointed and not my labour can alter further hinder either
againe god doth will command and worke as the principall agent all sinne which is wrought in me why shal therfore detest that which god wils or auoid that which god commands or not do that which god wils commands and works in me againe if be an elect god giues all meanes so certaine of saluation that cannot reiect them if be reprobate he denies me all meanes necessary either of the merits of christ offered for me or of grace and faith for me in vaine therefore is all my labour because if god hath prepared for me meanes effectuall they wilbe applied as they are decreed without me if not they will not be obteined by me and my care let therfore all care of heauen or hell be left to god and his ordination and let vs liue merrily fare daintily spend freely feed our sense and appetit fully and leaue all care or cogitation of heauen or hell to gods decree and ordinance which according to his will not our care will haue the effect which he hath appointed
this follows in reason and thus in reason may any one inferre and reason supposing he belieue the aforesaid false principles

to what vices the protestant doctrine leads

seaventhly for vices in particular how euery one doth receiue life grouth nourishment and encouragement by this their doctrine how men may be whetted

and animated to the free exercise of the same vices by vertue of it may by these reasons appeare

slouth which

saith the wiseman teaches many euils

and is the stepdame saith bernard of vertue the mother of sinne and the root and nurse saith chrisostome of desperation is by this doctrine nourished
for who will labour who assures himselfe that his labours works and sufferings haue neither any reward nor make any satisfaction but that they deserue hell and eternall punishment and that by them he can no more please god performe his will or fulfill his commandements then he can reach the starres or leape ouer the seas and that he hath no freedome or liberty of wil but must do as by god he is appointed and compelled and that only faith and apprehension of the iustice of christ will suffice to his iustification and saluation

secondly chastity which is commended in scripture as deseruing immortall praise by god man

as of more worth then all weight

as the fruit of the spirit

and as that which maks pages or followers of the lambe

christ iesus is indeed according to cyprian the ornament of noblemen the nobility of meane men the beauty of the deformed the comfort of the sorrowfull the augmentour of beatitude honour of religion the diminisher of vices the multiplier of vertue and the spouse of the omnipotent and which was so imbraced in the primitiue church that in some places a thousand in other two thousands in others
in others
men and in others as at ancyra
women professed it in one place and preferred it before the riches and pleasures of the world this precious vertue and pearle is debauched luxury which is as one cals it the gate to hell

the way to iniquity the biting of a scorpion the birdlime of wickednesse and the fountaine of perdition is fomented and increased by this doctrine
for who will labour to liue chastly who belieues as they teach· that chastity is impossible

and no more in mans power then it is not to be a man that a woman is as necessary as to eat drinke sleepe or sneese that marriage is as gold virginity as dung that all are to be condemned as guilty of murther who do not giue themselues to beget children who will abstaine from any

sensuall lust and brutish concupiscence to which his affection leads him who perswades himselfe that a man or woma sins as much in hauing a suggestion or motion of concupiscence though resisted as in consenting delighting or acting the sinne it selfe that it is no more sinne to yield then to resist lust that the sinne is pardoned before hand by vertue of the seale of baptisme and no more imputed by the meanes of faith then though it had neuer beene committed
he surely that is taught this and belieues this and withall that neither this nor any sinne can expell or take away his faith or damne him infidelity only excepted is foolish if he feare sinne and is senselesse and labours in vaine if he seeke and labour to bridle his concupiscence to mortify his affections to resist his temptations or to restraine or not giue himselfe to all sensuality his heart can desire which freely and fully he may do as by this doctrine he is warranted and secured
surely he that belieues thus as thus he is taught needs not feare any detriment to his soule or any punishment of his sinne or any offence of god what therefore can or at least will restraine him from following his fleshly appetites specially in secret

thirdly cruelty which how odious it is

is by diuers examples before declared with all rage ire and reuenge and the practise of them is by vertue of this doctrine dangerously perswaded for who will not be encouraged to inflict any seuere punishment and cruell tortures for any little offence committed against him who belieues that god ordaines soules to such horrible punishments in hell for no offence committed or forseene to be committed against his maiesty who desirous to imitate god will not rather exercise then detest actions of all cruelty and tyranny when he belieues that god is a iudge so seuere cruell and tyrannous that he ordaines and creates men to damnation and sinne and for the same sinne which himselfe commands works in them doth himselfe torment them with those horrible torments of eternall fire in hell who may not be incited to lay vpon subiects and seruants any command though neuer so heauy and intollerable when they read belieue that god laies vpon

al men precepts which are impossible to be performed who will bridle his rage and fury of passion when he perswades himselfe that he offends gods as much in resisting as in yielding to it and that neither gods particular fauour nor his speciall faith and is lost nor any sinne shalbe imputed or punishment inflicted vpon him for the sinne though in his rage he should kill murder and vse all reuenge vpon his enemies what needs therefore any man to feare or care in conscience what secret murder or villany he contriues or works so he can but auoid the shame or the world or the punishment of the lawes

fourthly pride which is the sinne

which god hates is

abomination to god and the begining of all sinne apostacy from god which is according to gregory the root of all euill and the queene of all vices yea according to augustine the begining the end and the cause of all sinnes and which makes vs like to the diuels as humility doth to the angels this pride is by this their doctrine kindled and as by bellowes blowne and set on fire
for what a strong motiue to pride and rebellion against all superiours is it for one to perswade himselfe that he is by his priuate spirit immediatly taught of god vnderstands all doctrine reueiled by god needs no instruction or direction from his pastour but may iudge and censure him yea with him all the ancient pastours doctours bishops and saints of gods church and may preferre his owne priuate iudgment and opinion before the generall iudgment and doctrine of gods church how forcible a perswasion to pride and presumption is it for one to assure himselfe that he is sure of gods fauour and of keeping it· of remission of his sinnes

and of perseuerance in grace to the end and that no sinne or offence can separate him from the fauour of god and from heauen yea that he is as iust and perfect as peter paul and the mother of god that god fauours him as much as he did christ and will as assuredly free him from hell and bring him to heauen he hath done christ and that without any his labour that he hath as much right to heauen as christ hath and can be no more damned then christ can be
which are luthers and zuinglius words
the assurance of all which cannot but be a veheme~t

perswasion to cause any man highly to esteeme of himselfe and to neglect all humility and feare of himselfe and all care with feare and trembling to worke his saluation
by all which is euident that this protesta~t doctrine is a great motiue and incentiue to all idlenesse lust cruelty and pride and so to all other vices and a strong impediment to the practise exercise of all contrary vertues and perfection

svbdiv

bad life
in the common people
in the ministers
in the first reformers of protestant religion confessed to be an effect of this doctrine

which yet that it may more plainly appeare and the more fully by example and practise be conuinced will produce the open confession of many prime protestants by whom this fruit and effect of this priuate spirit and the doctrine of it is confessed in their practise

in generall of all the common people

more particularly of their ministers and maisters

most specially of the chief founders pillars of their religion
by all whose is made apparent that lewd life wicked works and all licentious epicurean liberty among protestants is neither a corruption of the time nor an infirmity of mans nature nor a nationall vice only nor yet an abuse of doctrine or a defect of good order and discipline

but only and truly a proper fruit and effect naturally issuing from the substance of their doctrine and conformable to the principles of it being borne nourished and increasing together with it and by vertue of it gaining breath strength and ability

and first concerning the vulgar and common people· for germany where the ghospel began
luther confesseth that the world groweth dayly worse that men are now more reuengfull couetous licentious then they were euer before in the papacy


that before time when we were seduced by the pope euery man did willingly follow good works and now euery man neither

faith nor knoweth any thing but how to get all to himselfe by exactions pillage theft lying vsury


that it is a wonderfull thing and full of scandall that from the time in which the pure doctrine of the ghospell was first recalled to light the world should dayly grow worse
that no history of the gentils made mention of so diabolicall malice hatred as is found among those to whom the word is preached
the nobility husbandmen and all are growne so wicked that whereas before in papistry they had some shew of modesty now they are growne so mad and furious as though they were all full of diuels
that men who bragge now of the gospell and faith in their words are if they be inwardly examined nothing at all therfore the greatest of those who heare the gospell do deceiue themselues and with their false faith go to hell
that in this only we now shew our selues professours of the ghospell in that we will communicate vnder both kinds throw downe images eat flesh· and neither fast nor pray
this is the witchery of sathan that he will draw men from the pope but not to christ
this luther of his new conuertites the first fruit of his ghospell

melancthon luthers great friend and the glory of the first protestants saith that the case is cleare that in these countries all time and care is spent in drinking banqueting and cups that the people are come to that barbarousnesse that they thinke if they fast but one day they cannot liue till the next night
erasmus sarcerius a prime lutheran acknowledges that it cannot be otherwise but that lust must preuaile sith fornication adultery are accounted among vs for no sins for old and yong do nothing but drinke and dance
and wheras among the ancient germans an adulterer was not so much as heard off now that sinne is growne so common that it is counted but a sporte and iest and often adulterers are more esteemed then honest and shamfast men

smidelinus as famous as the rest saith that since we haue heard that to fast is neither a good worke nor pleasing to god we haue left all manner of fasting and betaken our selues only to bankets and drinkings so that if a man mention but fasting he is suspected that he is turned papist
that our ghospellers are so far from mending their manners that nothing but bestiality gluttony vsury pride blasphemy and prophanation of gods holy name is among them
and that the whole world may see that they are no papists nor put

any trust in good works they do not any good worke at all insteed of fasting they drinck day and night insteed of praying they banne and curse others
and do so horrible blaspheme the name of god

that the like is not heard among the turks
and yet this must be so euangelicall that they notwithstanding dare assure themselues that they haue faith in god haue god propitious to them and are better then idolatrous papists

brentius saith that

such is the corruption of manners in these times and such the desire to do wrong that there is no occasion of confiding in good works for why shall they confide in them which they haue not

ioan
spangenberge saith that it is a true word

and often repeated by many doctors that after the reuelation of antichrist men wilbe so wild that they will neither acknowledge nor haue any care of god but will do as they will what the diuell and the flesh shal suggest
this is now fulfilled for since the lies and deceits of antichrist and the pope haue beene reuealed men begin to belieue nothing and seing they are free from the bands of popery they wilbe free from the ghospell and all precepts of god and make that right and iust which euery one will

caluin saith that

men of his sect are the most wicked and flagitious of all mortall men yea so wicked that words cannot be found to expresse their wickednesse
they are horrible monsters and diuels in mens forme

wolphangus musculus a prime protestant confesseth

that to tell the truth they are become so vnlike themselues that wher+as in the papacy they were religious in their errour and superstition now in the light of the knowne truth they are more prophane then the very sonnes of this world

andreas musculus another famous lutheran also saith

the case thus standeth at this present with vs lutherans that if any be desirous to see a great rable of knaues of persons turbulent deceitfull coseners vsurers let him go to any citty where the ghospell is purely preached and he shall find them there by multituds
it is more manifest then that there neuer among the ethnickes

turkes and other infidels were more vnbridled and vnruly persons with whome all vertue honesty is quite extinct then are among the professours of the ghospell at this day
that to speake of fasting is but

to loose paper and tyme the germans care not now for fasting but for bibbing and banquetting if any shall but mention fasting though he alleadge neuer so much scripture for it he shall presently be counted a papist or an heretike

bucer one of the first and most prime reformers confesseth that the thing which the greatest part do seeme chiefly to haue aymed at by the ghospell is to cast off the yoake of all whatsoeuer manner of discipline pennance and religion which remayned in papistry and to do all thinges according to the will and lust of their flesh
for which it is not vngratefull to them to heare that a man is iustifyed by only fayth and not by good workes to which they haue no desire at all

paulus eberus a prime reformer with luther confesseth

that our whole euangelicall congregation is so full of schismes and offences that it is nothing lesse then that it makes shew to be which while all see with their owne eyes not without cause they doubt whether our euangelicall company be the true church in which so many and so enormous vices are seene

iacobus andreas a great promotour of lutheranisme confesses that

christian and serious discipline commanded by christ and required of christians is esteemed among vs new popery monkery for since we learned to be saued by only faith in christ good works haue been left of sith without them we may be saued by relying vpon christ only and his grace and merits
and that the world may know that they are no papists nor do put any trust in good works they will not do any good worke at all but insteed of fasting will night day lye bibbing and banqueting instead of praying stand swearing
and this kind of life is called by them euangelicum institutum the institution of the ghospell

wigandus a famous man one of the centurians sayth that the youth among the ghospellers become dayly lesse tractable more bould to commit those vices which in former tymes men of years knew not

simon vion cries vvoe vpon hamburge rostocke for their adulteries fornications drunkennesse vsury lying and all vices and woe to saxony for keeping such a light of euangelicall truth in so wicked life and manners so of the rest

to all which we will adde erasmus though not one of

their religion yet esteemed by them as a fauourer a present eye witnesse of them and their life who pronounceth this sentence of them looke sayth he

euery where vpon these euangelicall people and bring me one whome this ghospell hath made of a drunkard sober of a chast of one shamelesse shamfast
can shew many who are become worse then they were before whom knew pure sincere and without dissembling the same haue seene after they gaue themselues to this euangelicall sect to haue learned to talke of wenches to play at dice to leaue of praying to be most reuengefull of all iniuries vaine viperlike in manners

and destitute of all humanity speake by experience
wherupon it grew to a prouerbe witnesse one of their owne among them that when they were disposed to yield to their natural lust they would say to day we will liue lutheran like
all which is spoken of the lutherans in germany

for the protestants of england to omit for breuity other nations

and their life geffrey a great preacher and trauailer confesseth plainely

may freely speake what haue plainely seene in the course of some trauells and obseruation of some courses that in flandres was neuer more drunkennesse in italy more wantonnesse in iury more hypocrisy in more impiety in tartary more iniquity then is practised generally in england and particulerly in london

stubs a like famous preacher who trauelled through all england to see the ma~ners of the people after all his iourney pronounceth this sentence as concerning the people found them in most places dissolute proud enuious malicious disdaineful couetous ambitious carelesse of good workes that for good workes who seeth not that they the papists were farre beyond vs and we farre behind them
in witnesse whereof he recounts what monasteries churches hospitalls bridges schooles· colledges· and vniuersityes were builded by catholickes and pulled downe by protestants

the puritans in their mild defence confesse and say vvhat eye so blind that it doth not gush out with teares to behould the misery of our supposed church meane the great ignorance the superficiall worship of god the fearefull blasphemyes and swearing in houses and streets and the dishonour of superiours the pride cruelty

fornications adulteries drunkennesse couetousnesse vsuries and other like abominations
be hould and pitty the woefull and lamentable state of our church in these thinges and thus much of the state of the vulgar and common sort of protestants in what kind of vertue and perfection this their new ghospell hath trayned them vp for their deuotion life and manners euen in the first and purest tyme of it

for the clergy the lampes conductours of the rest what

and of what note hath beene their life and conuersation in generall both in england and germany will for england to auoid both offence and tediousnesse referre the reader desirous to know the to the owles almanack made by the puritans against the bishops and to the volume of saints pasquill vnto martin iunior

and pasquill and marphorius made by protestants against puritans all printed the yeare
in queene elizabeths raigne and to doctour sutcliffes answere to a libell supplicatory where the puritans are described for their pride malice cruelty couetousnesse vsury gluttony and their chamber cheere and other good matters kept for a rare banquet too shamefull and appearing
all conuincing what is their life and manners and all practised insteed of fasting and other godly exercise
and for germany wil only bring two or three witnesses for the generall to wit wolfphangus musculus who speaking of their clergy

saith if they do any thing vpright iust they do it not sincerly with any good intention but obiter by the way as altogeather neglecting that which is to be done by faithful ministers and are so farre from bringing in errours and superstition of doctrine as formerly was done that they do by their manners giue occasion to the people to fall into an indifferency of religion and epicurisme and into such a neglect of all religion that none neede to feare that by the example of the ministery men should become hypocrites superstitious worshippers of images and for from this care they do aboundantly deliuer themselues and others

ioan· wigandus saith that of the ministers many are parasites and flatterers

who fraudulently excuse the sinnes of great men and kindle coales of mischiefe by which polititians do thrust out sincere preachers out of their places and make them suffer more then women in childbed

paulus eberus saith of them that if we looke vpon the euangelicall doctours we shall find that some moued with vaine glory

others with enuious zeale others with contentions others with other vices do all destroy more with their wicked life then they build with their true doctrine
which shall suffice for the generality of the ministery

for particular persons obseruing that we speake not of the declining and worst age of their church

but of the reforming and best time nor of the vulgar sort of ministers but of their prime men and principall pillars among their reforming ministers nor out of our writers but out of their owne accusation and condemnation of themselues we will in generall looke into the life of some of their principall founders of their religion and se what life and manners in them their new doctrine did togeather with their reformation beget nourish

al which was ominously foreshewed by prodigious monsters first of a calfe at friburge in misnia with a head like to a monkes hood then of a hogge at hall in saxony with a shauen crowne like a priest both in the yeare before that luther cast of his habit and afterwards incestuously conioyned himselfe with one of the nine nunnes which koppen enticed out of the monastery of nimpsen in saxony

and first for luther that man of god

that light of the world that third elias that first euangelist next to christ paul with much more before noted as they call him if we co~sider his life and doctrine what it was while he belieued and imbraced the catholicke faith and compare it with the same what it was after he made his reformation we shall clearly perceaue the fruit and effect of this their new ghospel for life manners
and first for his life before his reuolt he confesseth himselfe and it is confessed by his owne followers that he liued in his monastery punishing his body with watching fasting prayer


that he honoured the pope of meere conscience
that he kept chastity pouerty obedience


whatsoeuer he did he did it with a simple heart of good zeale for the glory of god fearing grieuously the last day and desirous to be saued from the bottome of his heart


which are his owne words
but after he inuented his libertine ghospell he confesseth himselfe

and the same is

confessed by his followers

for lust and sensuality that he esteemed nothing more sweet or louing vpon the earth then the loue of a woman if a man can get it


that it was no more in his power to be without a woman then to be a man that the act of the flash is as necessary and more necessary no more to be stayed or omitted then to eat drinke sleepe purge make cleane the nose

wherupon he confesseth that am burned with the great flame of my vntamed flesh who ought to be feruent in spirit am feruent in the flesh in lust sloth eight dayes are now past wherin neither write pray nor study being vexed partly with the temptation of the flesh partly with other troubles
but

saith he it sufficeth me to know the glory of the riches of god and of the lambe which taketh away the sinnes of the world from him sinne cannot draw vs although we should commit fornication or kill a thousand times a day
vpon which his lust neither respecting his vow made to god of chastity which made it a sinne to commit any act of carnality nor the imperiall law which made it losse of ones head nor the shame of the world at which all wondred many were ashamed scandalized

nor the calamities of the time in which by the insurrection of the boores or common people

incited by him were killed to the number of one thousand and all germany was in misery but impatient of staying so much as one night he secretly at night hauing present only pomeran the priest luke the painter and the lawyer

without any communication with his friends the yeare
coupled himselfe to one of the runagate nunnes enticed out of nympsen by leonard koppen katherine by name a beautifull yonge woman of
yeares of age who within few dayes after the mariage as erasmus sayth was deliuered of a child and so as one fayth of him luther was yesterday a monke to day a bridgroome to morrow a husband and the next a father
which was the first fruit and one of the principall motiues of luthers reformation

but let vs heare his examen of his owne conscience his confession of himselfe vvhat sayth he

haue done all this day two houres cacaui too beastly to be englished three

houres eat and fower houres was idle
againe

vve eat till death· we drinke till death· we eat and drinke till we be poore and go to hell cacamus ad mortem

sit heere senselesse and stupid in idlenesse praying little mourning nothing at al for the church
and laughing at the folly of hierome benedict bernard and francis who labouring to represse the heat of the flesh by praying fasting afflicting their bodyes he sayth

he hath a more easy and ready way so that a wench be not wanting that is to haue a wench alwayes in the house which is the most present remedy for that disease and she as a woman ought to help a friend in that case
and least he should be thought to do otherwise the he taught his doctrine was according to his practise for he taught that to increase and multiply is not a precept but more then a precept which is not in our power to slippe or omit but more necessary then to eat drinke purge and sleep that

the husband shal say to his wife if thou wilt not come let the maid or another come and if that will not suffice dismisse and admit
that

as god seuerely prohibited kill not commit adultery so much more did he command to marry

for prayer and deuotion he taught that

god hath promised to heare our prayers therefore after thou hast prayed once or twice thou must belieue thou art heard and so must pray no more least thou tempt god and abuse his patience in hearing thee
and writing to a noble man he affirmes that

if we pray often for the same thing we shew little trust in god and so with our incre+dulous prayer we more more offend god for to aske the same thing often it nothing els but to conceaue that before we were not heard so do pray against the promises of god
therefore

we must not vse many words with god but let such short prayers as these suffice help vs god
father haue mercy on vs
that

papists do foolishly teach men to pray fast and do pennance only say thou that all thou canst do is nothing and this is to prepare the way for god though in the meane tyme thou do nothing but drinke malmesy and walke vpon roses and pray not word at all
that when

thou prayest whether it be standing or kneeling say boldly lord aske that thou heare me and will that thou graunt my request and so it must and shalbe and thus pray and no otherwise or els say thou will neither pray to thee nor haue thee prayed vnto
and lastly that

no

man can say our father except he ioyne with it curses and execrations for our father is not well sayd without banninges and cursings
this was luthers doctrine and manner of prayer

for other good workes and good life and both for obligation practise of them he taught
that

only faith doth iustify and only that fayth which includes not not hath annexed charity
that

only fayth is necessary to make vs iust all other thinges being free and neither commanded nor forbidden
that

fayth except it be without any the least good workes doth not iustify yea is no fayth

for good workes that

this shalbe a rule for vnderstanding of scripture that wheresoeuer the scripture doth commaund to do goods workes it is to be vnderstood to prohibit them
that

though the papists bring heapes of scripture as commending good workes yet care not for them though they bring more thou papist art very bragge with thy good works and scripture yet scripture is a seruant to christ therefore it moues me nothing
rely thou vpon the seruant will rely vpon the maister and lord of scripture to him yield and know that he will not lye nor lead me into errour
will rather adhere to him then for all scripture to be altered a hairs breadth from my opinion

for the ten commandements

that therefore the ten commandments do not belong to vs christians but only to iewes which is proued out of the text speaking to them whome it brought out of aegypt who were iewes not christians

vve will not admit that any the least precept of moyses be imposed vpon vs

therefore looke that moyses withall his law be sent packing in malam rem with a mischiefe that thou be not moued with any terrour of him but hould him suspected for an heretick cursed and damned and worse then the pope or the diuell

therfore to conclude vp all for sinne he sayth

that true and right saints must be subiect to great and heinous sinnes· and to continue such as they may not be ashamed to pray forgiue vs our sinnes
that

if it be true grace let it bring true not feined sinne god saues not feined sinners be a sinner and sinne stoutly but be more strong in fayth and reioyce in christ
it sufficeth vs to know the lambe from him no sinne can draw vs though we sinne commit fornication or murder a thousand tymes in one day
that

a christian is so rich that though he would yet he cannot be damned

by any so great sinnes except he will not belieue for no sinnes can damne him infidelity
and that himselfe did confesse to his ghostly father staupitius not sins of women but solid and horrible heinous offences


this was the doctrine accordingly the practise of this saint prophet elias euangelist angel and light of the world the singular eminent organ of the holy ghost endewed with so great piety gifts and such a doctour and interpreter of scripture as was not in the world since the apostles as before he is by his followers extolled

all which sayings of luther are in these words cited by gaspar scioppius who was a long time a follower and professour of luthers doctrine

secondly for his malice and enuy not only against the pope and catholiks which was implacable

but also against the sacramentaries his brethren fellow reformers whose part our english protestants follow he is so farre charged by the zuinglians with breach of all christian charity towards them· that he not only cals them hereticks damnable and execrable fectaries alienated from the church of christ whom he curses all concord with them and refuses to haue any familiarity by word or writing· or with them or any of them for euer but also saith they are insatanized supersatanized and persatanized in whose mouth sathan is infused perfused and transfused
for which saith zuinglius of him sathan doth endeauour wholy to possesse him

and say the tigurins his booke is full of diuels immodest railings anger and rage
and say our english protesta~ts he doth breake all christian modesty

and is far beyond the bounds of charity



for his pride and vaine insulting ouer all sorts of princes prelates and opposers of him it is apparent not only by his intemperate writings against henry the
of england and all the princes of germany but also by the plaine accusation of his owne brethren

by the tigurins

who expresly him for pertinacy too much insolency


by oecompadius

who accuseth him of being puffed vp with pride and arrogancy that he is in danger to be seduced by sathan
by conradus regius who laies to his charge such pride by which he doth extoll himselfe in his writings that god for it tooke fro

him his true spirit and in place of it gaue him a proud angry and lying spirit

and to confirme all this he was so arrogant and impudent that beyond all ciuility he arrogantly auouches of himselfe that he is such a one as the world hath not had these many ages

that himselfe is the only mortall man whom satan foresaw to be hurtfull to him
that since the apostles time no doctour or writer hath so excellently and cleerly confirmed instructed and comforted the consciences of the secular states as haue done by the singular grace of god
this certainly know that neither austine nor ambrose who are yet in this matter the best are equall to me heerein
that the ghospell is so copiously preached by vs that truly in the apostles time it was not so cleare
wherupon euen caluin himselfe charges him to be subiect to great vices and wishes that he had beene more carefull in acknowledging them
and himselfe confesseth of himselfe

that his profession is not of manners but doctrine
wishing that he were remoued from the office of preaching because his manners and life did not answer to his profession
which may suffice for a conuincing example to shew what fruit this new doctrine and priuat spirit brought forth in the first founder of it

for caluin beza zuinglius and others the chiefe supporters of this doctrine new religion it might suffice to shew their life disposition for manners

to remember that they were most of them if not all either religious men tyed by vow to pouerty obedience and chastity or els at the least priests in holy orders obliged to chastity and yet euery one of them by the liberty of their ghospell offered vp as the first fruits of it

themselues by execrable apostacy to all lust and sensuality in incestuous copulation either with like professed nunnes or other women subuerted and enticed by them
wherupon as luther an augustine frier began the dance so his schollers bucer a dominican martyr a canon regular bernardinus ochinus a franciscan followed ioyned themselues with professed nunnes and with them oecolampadius a brigittan monke pelican and spanberge franciscans knox a frier zuinglius and caluin priests carolostadius an gebardus an archbishop of colen and vergerius a cardinall chose for their mates other women
in

like manner in england cranmer and sands of canterbury yorke both priests and archbishops hooper of worcester barlow of chicester downhan of westchester scory of hereford barkely of bath and wels couerdale of excester all bishops bale in ireland bucer at and martyr at oxford with infinit more all monkes and religious did al of them plante and disperse the new ghospells doctrine through england by apostating from their vowed chastity to sensuall copulation vnder the title of mariage with wantons like themselues
this in generall say may suffice to discerne the fruit of this new ghospell what it brought forth for sanctity and holinesse of life and by what bellowes it was first blowen and kindled in the professors of it

he that is desirous to see more particulers of zuinglius

and his fellow ministers of zurich leo iude erasmus fabricius and eight other how they demanded of the bishop of constance liberty of marrying wiues for the satisfying to vse their owne wordes of their lust in which they spent say they their whole thoughts and meditation to satisfy their burning desires of the flesh for which they confesse they are made infamous before the congregations haue committed many thinges vnseemely and the people by the example of them are scandalized and speake ill of them
who would see of caluin

what fine bread made of fine flower mixed with sugar cynamon anizseeds and other spices made for him alone he alwayes eat had carryed with him wheresoeuer he dyned what notorious sinnes he is conuinced and accused off euen by protestants themselues

namely by conrandus schusselburg a learned superintendent of rauespurge the neighbour churches in germany who record to the view of all the world with constant asseueration thereof to omit catholike witnesses his sodomiticall lust for which he was burned publickly by the magistrates of noyon in france on the shoulder with a hoat iron and his other notorious vices and lasciuiousnes and withall what a notorious death he dyed not only stincking with loathsome vlcers wormes and lice in his members but also swearing cursing blaspheming despairing and calling vpon the diuell

who desires to read of beza

how shamefully he kept

andebertus a boy as another ganamed and claudia de mossa called by him candida as a strumpet foure yeares and then fled with her for infamy to geneua where he married her and writ shamefull epigrammes in comparing his loue to them both

how being
years old presently vpon her death he marryed another yonge widdow katherine
all which are witnessed of him by hessufius a protestant famous lutheran togeather with the aforesayd schusselburge who in generall besids the former particulers accuse him to haue liued like a hogge in the durt of all obscene lasciuiousnesse flagitious lust and wicked whoordome and adultery celebrated to his owne shame by his owne writings
who desires to read of iacobus andreas as famous a lutheran in germany

for he was chancelour of the vniuersity of tubinge as caluin was at geneua it is diuulged by his owne fellows seleucerus musculus hospinian to haue neuer byn seen so much as to say the lords prayer neither fro bed nor to bed

nor to haue shewne any sparkle of godlines but great lightnesse in his wordes deedes and counsels to haue beene guilty of most heynous couetousnesse adultery sacriledge robbing the poore whose goods he carryed from misnia saxony to tubinge to haue been without any conscience or religion at all and to haue had no other god but mammon bacchus
who say wil see these at large and more of them and of many other prime euangelicall founders to omit cranmer his carrying his wench in his trunke knoxk his marrying his and other marrying many wiues some hauing to the number often or twelue aliue let him read the liues of these and other such like prime protestants collected by brereley out of their own authours

and the protestants apology made by the same authour
by all which it will euidently appeare that as the foresayd protestant doctrine doth blow the bellowes and plaine the way to this licentious liberty and loosnesse of epicurean life and manners so the followers of it induced by the same did as notoriously practise and follow the same so that their life was made agreable to their doctrine and both did run on ioyntly togeather in all wicked and abominable practise of all sinne and iniquity

to which as contrary if we oppose the good life of

catholiks as a marke of their fayth and religion confessed euen by our aduersaries

the one will better illustrate the other
of our first apostles of england augustine mellitus iustus and iohn it is confessed by hollinshead that after they were receaued into canterbury they began to follow the trade of life which the apostles vsed exercising themselues in continuall prayer

watching and preaching despising all wordly thinges liuing in all points according to the doctrine which they set forth
and the like is reported by stow godwin and others
and both godwin fox mention and confesse diuers miracles wrought by augustine through gods hand
all contrary to the former life of luther

of dominike francis bernard and other such like founders of religious orders it is confessed by tindall that they were holy men
by melancthon that they vsed obedience pouerty and chastity without any sinne or impiety
by pantaleon that they were men famous for learning and holynesse
by fox of francis that he cast away all thinges from him outwardly chastised himselfe and liued so austerely that he couered his body with ice and snow called pouerty his lady and was so desirous of martyrdome that he went into syria to the soldan to seeke it
all farre different from the life of the first protestant reformers

of francis xauerius a iesuit and an apostle of india it is confessed by richard hackluite that he was a godly professour and painefull doctour of the indian nation in matters concerning religion
that after great labours iniuries and calamities suffered with much patience he departed indued with all spirituall bles+singes out of this life the yeare
after many thousands were by him brought to the knowledge of christ
of this holy man his particuler vertues and wonderfull workes in that religion all the later histories of the indian regions are full
and by another protestant it is sayd that the

king of portugall hearing of the great miracles he wrought sent his commission to his viceroy there dated in aprill anno to take examination thereof by oath
vvherupon

by certificate it was found that he had cured miraculously the dumbe the lame the deafe and with his word healed the sicke and

rai+sed sundry dead persons to life
that

after his death they found his body not only vnconsumed but also yielding forth fragrant smels

from whence they carryed it to goa and placed it there in the church of paul where yet to this day it remaineth free from corruption of which are witnesses all the inhabitants of that citty and trauellers thither
and by abraham hartwell in his booke dedicated to the bishop of canterbury his lord maister saith that it is reported

how in the discouery of the kingdome of congo the yeare
by odoardo lopez that great and vndoubted were shewed by god in the presence of a whole army
of which the authour sayth that though this conuersion of co~go was accomplished by massing priests after the romish ma~ner yet this action which tendeth to the glory of god shall it be concealed and not committed to memory because it was performed by popish priests and popish meanes god forbid
let the germans shew any such in the peruersion of germany to protestancy

of the catholike people of ancient tyme it is confessed by the centurists that although in this age they speake of the seauen hundred yeares after christ the worship of god was darkened with mans traditions and superstition yet the study to serue god and liue godly and iustly was not wanting to the miserable common people they were so attentiue to their prayers as they bestowed almost the whole day therein they did exhibit to the magistrate due obedience they were most studious of amity concord and society so as they would easily remit iniuries all of them were careful to spend their tyme in honest vocation and labour to the poore and to strangers they were curteous and liberall and in their iudgements and contracts most true

of the catholike prelates of ancient tyme in england he that desires to see their vertues commended let him read godwin

then chaplain to the lord treasurer now one of their new bishops and he shall find giuen by him rare and extraordinary comendations to the bishops of england as dunstan elphege lanfranke anselme rodulph baldwine hubert vvalter edmund iohn peckam robert winchelsey iohn stratford thomas bradwardine simon sudbury hugh hugh pateshall paulinus geffrey plantagenet richard scroope richard poore richard fox iohn morton reginald poole cuthbert tonstall and others
whereas of our late protestant bishops he shall find little or no prayse and yet the writer one of their own bishops

of the ancient common catholike people of england it is confessed by stubs a great enemy to papists

that for good workes who seeth not that heerin they are far beyond vs and we far behind them for example what memorable famous buildings and what ancient monuments haue they left to the world behind the vvhat churches chapels and other houses of prayer did they erect to the end the religion and seruice of god might be continued yea what monasteries abbeyes priories and other religious houses vvhat number of good bridges did they make how many almes houses hospitalls and spittles did they found what high wayes vvhat pauements and causies in summe vvhat famous colledges halles and vniuersities vvhat schooles and free schooles also
is it not a shame vnto vs that our liuing in the tymes of superstitions should notwithstanding so farre passe vs in good workes that we may not be compared with the in any small measure

of the late and present catholiks generally of all cou~tryes syr edwin sandes that great sayth

that there are in great multitude on both sides protestants and catholikes for so there are vndoubtedly men vertuous and learned fraught with the loue of god and the truth aboue all thinges men of memorable integrity of hart and affection whose liues are not deare to them much lesse their labours to be spent for the good of gods church
and some side of a leafe afterwards he further fayth let the protestants looke with the eye of charity vpon them of the papacy as well as of seuerity and they shall find some excellent orders of gouernement some singular helpes for increase of godlines and deuotion for the conquering of sinne for the in vertue and contrarywise in themselues looking with a more single and lesse indulgent eye they shall find there is no such absolute perfection in their doctrine and reformation
and he further sayth of the catholike clergy

that in their sermons much matter both of fayth and piety is eloquently deliuered by men surely of wonderfull zeale and spirit
and

that all countryes are full of the iesuites bookes of prayer and piety in their owne language and wonderfull is the reputation which redoundes thereby to their order
in so much as he

sayth of the late pope clement the eight he is reputed to be a man of good calme disposition deuout in his wayes and thinkes without doubt that he is in the right he will weep very often some conceaue

vpon a weaknesse and tendernes of mind habitued therein by custome others say vpon piety and godly compassion at his masses at his at his fixing vp of his iubilies his eyes are still watering sometymes streaming with teares
he is an enemy to the licentious liues of the fryars

to the pompe secular brauery of cardinals
he is magnificall and cerimoniall in his outward comportment in his priuate austere and humble
and concludeth there that he was a good man a good prince and a good prelate
likewise stubbes confesseth that certainely to speake the truth there is many tymes found conscionabler and playner dealing among most of the papists then among many protestants and if we looke narrowly into the ages past we shall find more godlinesse deuotion and zeale though blind more loue one towardes another more fidelity faythfullnesse euery way in them then is now to be found in vs
now co~paring as the fruit of their doctrine the life and manners of the forecyted protestants with the life and manners of the catholikes the ancient of the one with the ancient of the other the moderne of the one with the moderne of the other the founders of religion of the one with the founders of the other the preachers and teachers of the one with the teachers of the other the commo sort of the one with the common sort of the other and discerning both by their fruites whether are in their life more christian

and are to christia doctrine more conformable inimici nostri sint iudices our enemies whose authority as before is confessed by themselues to be a most strong argument against themselues as they are witnesses of both so let them be iudges of both

the conclusion comparing the priuate spirits doctrine

with the catholike churches doctrine whether leads to the greater honour of god
sect
ix

one thing remaines for the accomplishing of this chapter which is for satisfying of an vsuall triuial ostentation of the protestants that they forsooth do more

in their religion then we in ours honour god iesus christ to compare pararell them and their priuate spirit with vs and our catholicke churches spirit in the principal points of their and our doctrine and therby to propose to the indifferent reader a generall view of both wherby he may discerne how far they with their priuate spirit and doctrine do dishonour and derogate
from god

from christ

from saints and angels in heauen

from holy scripture

fro holy church

from sacraments

from man and his meanes to saluation which are faith grace iustification good works freewill and the rest in all which their doctrine is negatiue and detractiue in euery one
and on the contrary how we and our doctrine do honour attribut to the same god and christ all worthy and due respect of veneration honour in all which as it is affirmatiue in it selfe so it is honourable to god and agreable to reason in all and euery particular point and opinion in controuersy

first therfore for god they dishonour and derogate

from the blessed trinity in that as before some of them do deny the distinction of the three persons some the vnity of one nature some the consubstantiality of the sonne with the father some the deity of the sonne from the father as god of god some the deity of the holy ghost as god some the prayer holy trinity one god haue mercy vpo vs
we with the ancient church acknowledge three persons and one god the second person god of god and consubstantiall with the father and the third person of the holy ghost proceeding fro both the father the sonne in them one holy trinity

three persons and one god

they and their spirit derogate from the mercy of god in that according to them he is cruell and tyrannicall in that he will not haue all saued will not giue sufficient meanes to all to be saued hath willed appointed and ordained millions of soules to be damned and to sinne· that for it he may damne them and accordingly torment the for that sinne which he himselfe willed ordained wrought and compelled them vnto
we and our catholicke church attribute honour to him and his mercy in that according to vs he would haue all saued giues to all sufficient meanes

to be saued creates and ordaines all to be saued wils not the death and damnation of any nor doth damne any but those who for their owne fault and sinne by themselues willingly committed against him his good will and goodnesse do deserue·
they their spirit do derogate from gods goodnesse

in that according to them he who is good al good yet is not pleased pacifyed worshipped or delighted with good works but doth will ordaine commande compell and necessitate bad works and so is the authour of all euill and all euill works in men and doth esteeme impute that which is wicked and sinfull in men for no sinne in them but accounts that which is bad good him that is wicked iust
we our catholik doctrine do attribute due honour to the same goodnesse of god in that according to it god hates detests· forbids and punishes all sinne and sinfull actions conuerts sanctifies purifies and make cleane pure and iust all sinners by his grace duely disposing themselues so reputes them as they are become truely iust in that god is delighted pleased pacified and honoured by good workes which he doth will command and reward in man who according to his will by his grace workes them

they their priuate spirit derogates from his iustice

in that according to their doctrine he is short of iustice in rewarding none who deserue well and do him seruice all iustice in that he ordaines men to an eternall and intollerable paine who haue deserued none

in that he punisheth them for that which he himselfe not only willed and commanded the to do but also wrought and effected in them

in that he creats and dignifies them with his gifts graces for that end that he may himselfe cruelly torture and torment them and that in hell for no other end but to shew his power iustice ouer them

in that he laies precepts vpon them which are impossible for them to performe and commands them to abstaine from that which himselfe forces them to do and wils them to practise that which he giues not power freedome or sufficient meanes to practise
we and our catholicke doctrine do honour and giue due respect to his iustice
in that according to vs he rewards all who deserue well and

punisheth none but those who deserue ill

in that he punisheth all for their owne fault which they themselues committed and none for that which himselfe willed

in that he created all to be saued and gaue them meanes sufficient to be saued in which he shewed his mercy and punisheth with hell those who would not vse those meanes in which he shewed his iustice

in that he gaue precepts and made lawes easy gaue meanes to performe them sufficient punisheth only those who willingly breake them

they and their priuate spirit derogate from his omnipotency

in that according to their doctrine he is not able to place one body in two places in the sacrament nor two bodies in one place in his natiuity resurrection and ascension nor to draw a cable rope or camell through a needles eye nor by his absolut power to worke any more the already he hath wrought
we and our catholicke doctrine do attribut to his omnipotency that he is able to do all the former and what more he pleases to do which is not either wicked and so is against his goodnesse or not contradictory and so implies in it selfe an impossibility to be done
and in these do the protestants their spirit by their doctrine derogate from god and his deity from his goodnesse his mercy his iustice and his omnipotency and impute to him wickednesse cruelty iniustice and impotency
in all which we in our doctrine do the contrary

secondly for christ our blessed sauiour

they their doctrin of the priuate spirit do dishonour him derogate
from his felicity beatitude in this life denying him to be viator and comprehensor that is enduring the paine and miseries of mortall men in his body and enioying the felicity and blessednesse of glorious saints in his soule
in which we do honour him

belieuing that from the first instant of his co~ception his soule had in his body the same blessednesse as now it enioyes in heauen by the perfect vision fruition of god though by dispensation for our redemption the same did not redound to the glory of his body till after his resurrection


from his knowledge they derogate and dishonour

him

in making him ignorant and defectiue of knowledge in many things and as a scholler to haue profited in his booke and learning of sciences and trades as other children do
in which we giue him the honour to haue had all the treasures of knowledge and wisedome to haue vnderstood all the perfection of all sciences and artes and to haue perfectly conceiued all things past present or to come by a diuine infused knowledge from the first instant of his conception in his mothers wombe

thirdly from his primacy and supremacy ouer his church

they derogate and dishonour him in that they deny him as a man sensible and visible to haue beene the head foundation of his church and to haue had any perpetual visible monarchy of the same heere on earth
in which we honour him belieuing that as man he is the head of men of the church and of the visible monarchy of the church which he established for euer and that euery knee ought to bow downe and adore him as the sauior of it and that he hath dominion ouer all by his death and resurrection and did also leaue a visible vicegerent after him by whom we should be gouerned visibly as by himselfe inuisibly

fourthly from his authority to make lawes and iudge vs

they derogat and dishonour him in that they take from him al power to make any lawes or giue any precepts of true faith morall life or good manners for our instruction direction deny him as a iudge to haue exercised any iudgment vpon the liuing and faithfull
in which we giue him the honour to haue beene our law maker our iudge and to haue made a new law of grace abrogating the old of moyses and in it to haue prescribed vnto vs obedience to his precepts of faith and good life

fiftly from his sanctity they derogatiue much and dishonour him greatly in that they call him truly and properly a sinner a great sinner and the greatest sinner of all sinners who sinned in discurtesy to his mother in inconsideration in his actions in forgetfulnesse of his function in staggering betweene praising and blaspheming god· betweene hope and despaire and in renouncing his saluation

for which he was execrable to god cursed with the damned being in all these properly a sinner and not only by the imputation of our sinnes to him as in their opinion euen man is iust by imputation of his iustice to him and so as truly sinfull as euer any man was iust
all which we abhorre as blasphemy belieuing that he suffered paines and payed therby the price of our redemption but was innocent impolluted immaculate incontaminat and segregated from all sinners and sinfull actions bearing the punishment of our sinne in his body but being free from all imputation of the guilt of sinne in his soule

sixtly

from his redemption of mankind they derogate and dishonour him

in that they deny the vertue of his death passion and precious blood to haue been any full satisfaction or redemption of mankind but only the paines and suffering in his soule to haue been accepted as sufficient

in that they deny the vniuersality and fulnesse of his redemption to haue been offered for all men affirming him to haue dyed only for the elect and to haue offered or left no meanes of redemption for the wicked and reprobat

in that they deny the effect and efficacy of the same to haue extended to the abolishing and washing away of sinne to the inward sanctification of the soule by any inward and inherent grace and iustice which should enable it to keep the commandments of god and to auoid mortal offence against god
in all which we honour him and his redemption in that
we belieue and professe that his pretious bloud shed vpon the crosse and his death and passion offered vp to god was a full price a perfect redemption from sinne

that the same was a full price satisfaction and redemption for all the sinnes of all persons in all the world

that the same purchased of his part for all sinners not only are imputatiue but also an inherent and reall iustification by grace which doth wash away the deformity of sinne cure the infirmity of the soule and giue strength to the keeping of gods commandements and to the auoiding of sinne and so the meriting of a reward at gods handes

seauenthly from his merit and satisfaction they derogate

and dishonour him

in that they deny him to haue by it satisfyed the iustice of god for any one sinne or to haue merited to himselfe his owne exaltation to glory or to our workes either any satisfaction for sinne or any merit of reward by his grace
in all which we honour the same belieuing that he fully in iustice satisfyed and offered to god a sufficient price for our sinnes that he merited for himselfe his owne body the glory of his resurrection and to vs not only for our sinnes a full price and satisfaction but also for our good works a vertue by grace both to satisfy in some sort for sinne and to merit a reward of more grace present and glory to come

eightly about his corporall death and passion they shamefully derogate and dishonour him in that they affirme he suffered both in body and soule the paines torments of hell the death of the soule the separation of the soule from god the same infernall and eternall paines which the very diuells and damned do suffer for the tyme and which in rigour are due to sinne and all sinners which except he had suffered he had not satisfyed for vs nor sufficiently redeemed vs
in all which we doe so honour his life and death that we attribute to euery action and passion of his euen to the least drop of his bloud that worth and valew arysing of the dignity of his diuine person that it was sufficient to haue satisfyed for an infinit world of sinnes and that the paines he suffered were only in the sensible and inferiour part of the soule and body but did not touch the superiour part of his soule that they were voluntarily sustained and offerred vp to god for vs and accepted by god for vs as being of more dignity then the offence of all our sinnes was of indignity whereby he neither suffered nor needed to suffer nor could in the dignity of his person suffer any paines ot hell but by the paines of the crosse though by the tendernes of his coplexion more painefull to him then to any other did pay a sufficient price make a full attonement offer a perfect satisfaction and performe the part of a complete redeemer and sauiour for all mankind· and the sinnes of all men

ninthly in the certainty of his saluation they blasphemously

derogate from him

and dishonour him more then themselues in that they affirme euery one of themselues to be infallibly certaine of his saluation and more certaine by his speciall faith of it then by his generall faith of the trinity or incarnation of christ and yet that our sauiour was fearfull doubtfull wauering and vncertaine of his saluation did strugle with the horrour of death feared to be absorpt vp of eternall death was tormented with the anxiety of gods wrath and indignation and that more then any man euer was or could be in which his horrour and desolation consists the summe of their consolation as their owne words more fully before related do expresse
in all which we do so far honour him that we affirme and belieue that the he suffered he willingly offered vp to god for vs that he was sure and secure that god his father did alwayes heare him alwayes loue him alwayes assist him alwayes comfort him that no feare doubt wauering or perturbation did or could euer enter into his will or vnderstanding yea that all that time of his passion his soule had the perfect vision and fruition of god and only his sensible partes endured those paines and torments of the crosse

tenthly

as for his descending into hell they derogate from it and dishonour him in that they affirme he descended either only to the graue in body or also to the lower hell in soule to suffer the paines of it either before his death on the crosse or after it in hell but not to haue freed the patriarchs from limbus by the presence of his soule there
we honour it in belieuing that he descended in soule further then to the graue to which he only descended in body but not so far as to suffer the paines of hell in soule but only to the limbus patrum where he gaue the patriarches there detained present liberty fruition of eternall hapinesse afterwards carried them with him to the place of glory and so triumphed ouer hell led aptiuity ccaptiue

eleuenthly

from his resurrection and ascension they derogate and dishonour him both by denying him the subtility or penetration of his body wherby he was able to passe through either the stone of the sepulcher at his resurrection

or the dores of the house at his entrance to his disciples or the hardnesse of the heauens at his ascension all which they wil haue either dissolued or opened or diuided
we honour attribut more dignity to the same belieuing that by the gift of subtility or penetratio his body did pierce passe through the stone the dores and the heauens at his resurrection and ascension as it did also his mothers wombe at his natiuity with out any diuision dissolution or detriment to the nature of either the one or the other in which also he shewed his subtility and consequently his impassibility or immortality

twefthly from his adoration and inuocation by vs as he is now in heauen they derogate and dishonour him in affirming that as man he is not to be adored or inuocated by vs
we honour him as man so far that we bow downe at the name of iesus praying to him with the blind man the cananean saying sonne of dauid haue mercy on vs


and fall down with the

sages

the wome adore him in al which and many more as they by their priuate spirit the doctrine of it do derogate take from christ his honour his power his goodnesse his beatitude his knowledge his sanctity his certainty of saluation his adoration and the vertue and power of his passion redemption resurrection ascension so do we in our catholike doctrine attribute to same due honour and dignity so both in our doctrine practise giue more honour praise power and glory to god and to iesus christ then they do either in doctrine or practise

thirdly· for the saints and blessed soules in heauen they dishonour them and take from them

their state of beatitude affirming as luther

and caluin do that they yet sleepe and neither know what we do nor yet enioy any present glory and beatitude till the day of iudgment

their perfection of sanctity in affirming as caluin

doth both of angels and saints that their obedience is imperfect that their iustice is defectiue and doth not satisfy god that

their works require pardon and that in them is folly

vanity and frailty

their power of doing miracles by the gift of god which

beza piscator vrsinus and perkins to be a vertue proper only to god not communicated to any creature man or saint

their difference and degree or honour affirming that all are equall in glory beatitude and reward and that no lawrels or crownes of accidentall beatitude are due to martyrs confessours or virgins

their respect and esteeme with god denying that god doth either apply in any sort their merits to vs or doth help and respect vs for their prayers

their knowledge of vs and our affaires on earth denying that they heare vnderstand or know vs or any thing we do heere on earth

their charity towardes vs affirming they neither at our intercessious sollicite or pray to god for vs nor offer vp any petitions and miseries of ours to god

their honour and inuocation by vs denying it to be lawfull to worship them to honour the to inuocate them or so much as saith luther to imitate and follow their example

the custody and of angels ouer vs and their hierarchies and orders in heauen denying or at least doubting of the custody of our angell guardian the difference of al hierarchies and orders among angels
in al which we and our doctrine on the contrary do attribute to them perfect and present beatitude in their soules complete obedience in their performing the will of god vpright sanctity in all their actions extraordinary power in working miracles notable difference of degrees of glory eminent knowledge in vnderstanding our prayers excellent charity in making intercession for vs and due honour and veneration in giuing them adoration inuocation and imitation befitting both the saints for their prayers for vs and the angels for their custody of vs

fourthly for the word of god they abuse it take
from one first and principall part of it to wit all the vnwritten word or which is diuine vnwritten tradition

from the written word they chop and cut off from the old testament fourteene peeces or partes and some of them from the new testament seauen whole bookes from the

canon of scripture


for the translation of scripture they reiect the ancient and follow euery nation euery congregation and euery person a new translation which best pleases them

therby leaue no certainty of the verity of any

for the sense of scripture they contemne that which the spirit of god did inspire to the ancient fathers councels church and follow that which euery mans priuate spirit suggests and therby follow not the meaning of the spirit of god

but that of their owne spirit

for their faith grounded vpon scripture they belieue only those points which their spirit finds in that part translation and sense which they chose and therby make an vncertaine imperfect mained kind of faith and religion

for their iudge and meanes to try which is scripture

and which is true sense of it they admit not any infallible iudgment either of church or of cou~cels or of pastours but leaue to euery man to choose himself what he will belieue to iudge and follow whom he pleases in his beliefe wherby they can haue neither any vnity in faith not any certainty of scripture of scripture sense
we in our doctrine do admit for the word of god not only that which was written in paper but also that which was deliuered in preaching by the apostles
we receiue without any addition or diminution that canon which the auncient church twelue hundred yeares ago receiued that translation which for as many ages hath been approued that sense which the auncient fathers councells and church euer since christ allowed that iudge which hath an infallible warrant from god to iudge truly and impartially of the canon the text the translation the sense all whatsoeuer is doubtfull
and all our practise is to follow the spirit of god speaking in the auncient fathers councels church by which we are secure from errour or falshood about the scripture

and sense of it

fifthly for the church of god they with their priuate spirit dishonor it and derogate from it

from the power and authority of it as not hauing according to them any visible head and gouernour assisted with the holy ghost to direct and gouerne it and to iudge of all causes and controuersies

in it and so make it headlesse and vngouerned
we honour it in acknowledging it to be a visible and perpetuall monarchy with a setled and spirituall both gouernour and gouernement hauing in it an infallible authority to iudge and decide all causes and controuersies

they derogate from the visibility perpetuity and infallibility of the same

making it not only subiect to errour and corruption but to haue erred and perished or at least become inuisible for many ages
we honour it in belieuing that it cannot erre faile perish become inuisible or be corrupted in fayth but that it is the piller of truth against which assisted by the holy ghost the gates and power of hell and heresy cannot preuaile


they derogate from the vnity sanctity vniuersality and succession of the same as notes and markes to distinguish it from all other congregations which they reiect and admit not
we reuerence and respect it as one holy catholike and apostlike church which no other congregation is or can be


they derogate from the vncontrollable authority stability of the decrees of councells and from the infallible testimony of the vnanime consent of the fathers doctors of the church both which they at their pleasure censure condemne
we receaue imbrace and follow them as guids and directours to truth and as witnesses and testimonies of truth belieuing that which they belieue and reiecting that which they before reiected

they derogate from the splendour and beauty of the church in the state of prelates

in the single life of the clergy in the retirednesse of the religious persons in the ornaments of the churches and in the variety of so many orders and professions all which they reiect condemne as needlesse or superstitious
we reuerence and honour the same as tending to the externall honour of god and the magnificence of his church thereby making the church beautifull as the moone elect as the sunne wel ordered as an army of men
and to co~clude they make the church the mystery of iniquity a whore a harlot

and a strumpet the whore of babylon drunken with al abominable filth of superstition and abomination of idolatry and antichristianity with which she hath made all the christian

world all kinges and emperours and that not for one or two ages but for seauen on ten or twelue or fourteene ages according to diuers opinions drunke with the same cup of superstition abomination idolatry and antichristianity and make it a body consisting of persons whoeuen the best and purest are in all partes and in euery action stayned impure sinnefull vniust and wicked
we doe belieue confesse it to be the kingdome the citty the house of god the spouse of christ the temple of the holy ghost the pillar of truth which christ hath purchased washed with his precious bloud made immaculate incontaminate and vnspotted pure holy and perfect before him which no errour of superstition or idolatry can possesse no power of pagans or heretikes or schismatikes or other wicked christians can suppresse no subtilty of heresy infidelity or sathan himselfe can supplant destroy or extinguish

sixhtly for the sacraments they from the number of seauen do curtaile fiue

and leaue only two and from these two they take away from the one that is baptisme
the effect and vertue making it only a signe or seale no cause or instrument of grace and of no more vertue then the baptisme of iohn baptist


they take away all necessity of it making it not needfull for infants whom they will haue saued by the parents faith without it
from the other that is the eucharist they take away both the fruit and the substance of it making it not the reall body and bloud of christ but only a bare signe and remembrance of it
not any sacrifice offered to god but only a sacrament signing or sealing grace and therby robbe christ of all adoration by it as a sacrame~t and of all subiection or acknowledgment of dominion by it as a sacrifice and they robbe the church of all benifit comfort both by the sacrament and sacrifice
we do admit for seuerall states of persons seuerall sorts of benefits by seauen seuerall kindes of sacraments all as instruments of gods power causing grace which assists all sorts of persons in their seuerall states and functions and all excell the sacraments of the old law
for the sacrament of baptisme we belieue it to be a meanes of regeneration from originall sinne by which

all sinne and punishment due to sinne both original actual is fully remitted and by which all persons are admitted into the mysticall body of iesus christ in his holy church and made capable of the benefit of the rest of the sacraments
and for the sacrament of the eucharist we belieue that not only conteines the fountaine of grace but also is offered to god as a sacrifice to apply the vertue of his sacrifice on the crosse for the remission of our sinnes by which is giuen much honour to god and receiued great benefit by gods church much comfort to the faithfull both liuing and dead

seauenthly for faith they and their priuate spirit admit many sorts of faith and in that none at all

and make as many faiths as there are priuate spirits in particuler persons and in that destroy all vnity of faith
we admit one holy catholicall and apostolicall faith one in al and generall to all who in all are directed by one spirit of gods church
they admit a new and faith neuer receiued by any but in some one or other point by condemned hereticks

in whom it was condemned
we receiue an auncient and euer belieued faith euer receiued and approued by general cou~cells ancient fathers holy saints in gods church
they reiect the grounds of faith as scripture traditions church

councells and fathers
we admit belieue and rely vpon them all as grounds foundations wheron we ground and build our beliefe
they admit none of the necessary meanes of faith neither any common reuelation of god

but priuate of their owne spirit nor any proposition of church but their owne fancies nor any credible testimony and motiues of perswasion to make their beliefe probable nor any habit of faith to assist the vnderstanding in belieuing nor any pious affection to incline their will to assent nor any assent by a diuine supernaturall and christian faith but by a general and as they call it a fained and diabolicall faith by which they belieue the articles of their faith
we do settle and rely by our faith in respect of the obiect reuealed vpon the reuelation of god the proposition of church the motiues of credibility and in respect of persons belieuing vpon the infused gift of faith the pious inclination of the will by grace

and the infallible assent caused by the former diuine helpes and grounded vpon the former infallible foundations as before is at large proued

they admit into the vnity of their faith all hereticks and schismaticks collecting and scraping from them all raggs and scraps of broken and condemned opinions and heresies and yet will not admit into the vnity of their inuisible church any sinners wicked or reprobate persons but all and only the elect and predestinate
we reiect from communion of all faith with vs all condemned hereticks and schismaticks and condemne with the ancient church them and all their condemned opinions and admit into the externall communion of our church all those who not cut off by excommunication agree with vs in vnity of fayth that therein their life and manners may be reformed and amended by the example of others by vertue of sacraments preaching of the church and pastours of the same
in all which they and their spirit take from fayth all vnity in it all groundes of it all meanes to it all supernaturall vertue in it all dignity all certainty all necessity and all vertue and efficacy following vpon it and so leaue no more but an human faigned and diabolicall fayth or a shadow of fayth and no theologicall diuine fayth at all
all which is contrary in our doctrine of fayth

eightly for man they by their priuate spirit derogate and take away from him
all freedome liberty of wil naturall to him as following vpon his being a reasonable soule and distinguishing him from brute beastes
we attribute that freedome by which he concurs with gods grace and his motions to his owne good and is the authour of his owne euill


they take from him all infusion and habits of grace which do giue life beauty and ability to the soule
all which we admit both of fayth hope charity and all morall vertues to enable and assist vs in the exercise of all piety

they take from him all inward iustification adoption

and perfection and leaue him only an exteriour imputation of the same supposing god to account impute him iust but to leaue him sinnefull and vniust
we admit in man an inward reall and true iustification sanctification or adoption

by grace which inwardly infused and remayning doth expell away sinne renue and reuiue our soule and adopt vs heires to the kingdome of heauen by which god making vs pure and iust doth therefore account and repute vs such

they leaue a man after his iustification

impure vniust sinnefull and vncleane in all the workes of his soule and in euery action of the same making all the best workes proceeding from him to be sinnefull and hatefull to god and deseruing eternall damnation and so leaue him destitute of any merit or reward
we make him pure iust and cleane by grace which doth giue life to the soule as the soule doth giue life to the body and therewith doth impart to it motion vertue beauty and power to do good to please god and to merit a reward at his handes by which man increasing in grace and merit doth also increase in perfection and glory

they take from man all benefit all necessity all possibility of doing good workes of keeping gods law

of abstayning from sinne and thereby make him sinnefull as well in doing good as euill as well in refraining as committing euill
we attribute to him ability to auoid all sinnes possibility by grace to keep gods lawes as easy and sweet and to do not only workes of precepts which are commanded but also workes of counsell and more then are commanded

they take from man all benefit of prayer as of thinges either needlesse which otherwise are certaine and sure to be obtayned or hopelesse as impossible to be done or obtayned by vs and thereby derogate from all vertue and feruour of prayer and deuotion
we encourage men to prayer by affirming that god hath made our prayer a meane by which he will and without which he will not dispose many of his benefits to vs and that therefore he will haue vs pray that by our prayer we may obtaine

they take from man all feare care and labour for his saluation

by their assurance that only fayth iustifyeth and saueth that sayth once had cannot be lost and make him idle carelesse and presumptuous of himselfe by their securing him by speciall fayth of his iustification saluation
we do teach him by our doctrine with holy scripture not to be secure of the

propitiation of his sinne but with feare and trembling to worke his saluation by good workes to make his vocation sure and therfore to liue piously to walke warily to watch diligently and to preuent carefully sathan and his craft
in all which they robbe man and leaue him so bare of all benefits either of nature or grace that they leaue him neither liberty of will nor ability or concurrence to do good nor infused grace and guifts to assist him in good to arme him against sinne to giue due honour to god to deserue reward with god to adopt him the child of god or to giue him any encouragement in walking the way of god in treading the path of vertue auoiding the allurements to sinne and the snare of sathan
all which are contrary in vs and in our catholike doctrine

ninthly for sinne they and their priuate spirit make not only all actions sinnes but all sinnes mortall and so all actions mortall sinnes

and all as well good as bad deseruing damnation and therby in a sort disswade as much from good as from bad actions and make men desperate of doing good and prone to doe all bad
wee make of works some good and some bad and of bad some mortall sins depriuing of grace and glory some veniall not depriuing of grace and yet diminishing the feruour of grace and thereby doe perswade men in due sort to auoid all sinne chiefly mortall sinne and encourage them to do good and animate them to increase in grace goodnesse and perfection
they make the auoiding of bad or the doing of good works the keeping of gods commandements

or the performing his will to be impossible and therby disharten men from attempting either to keepe his precepts or to obey his will or to please him in any worke or action
we belieue his yoake to be sweet and his burthen easy and the obeying of his commandements auoiding of sinne by grace to be possible facile and therby encourage all to labour that they may obey his precepts and performe his holy will and pleasure

they make no bad works to be imputed to the elect and no good works to escape punishment in the reprobate and therby make the one fearlesse carelesse of any bad and the other hopelesse and

desperate to do any good
we make good works in all to be good and in the good to be meritorious and bad works in al to be bad and to deserue punishment and depriue men of gods fauour till by repentance they be washed and pardoned and therby inuite all to do good and to auoid bad and repent them of bad
they hould that no sinne in the faithfull can depriue him of faith which once had can by no sinne be lost and therby lull men in a security of saluation and allure them to a liberty of sinne which they belieue cannot depriue them of gods fauour
we hould that grace once had may be lost and is lost by mortall sinne and therby warne men carefully to keep gods grace diligently to preuent sinne before it be committed and presently to report after it be co~mitted

tenthly for good works they their priuate spirit hould that no good works are good iust perfect

or meritorious yea that none are necessary or possible but that al are sinfull and therby make it bootlesse and needlesse to striue to do them
we hould that good works are not only good but may be perfect meritorious of an eternal reward wherby we animate all to the working of them
they hould that co~tinency virginity is no vertue but a suggestion of sathan wicked diabolicall and a rebellion against god in religious persons and that matrimony is a state more noble perfect spirituall then it and therby induce all to marry
we hould that single life chastity and continency is a vertue more perfect noble and holy then marriage and therfore is preferred by god as more spirituall before marriage and more to be esteemed by men is more honourable
they hold that fasting and punishing the body by mortification watching discipline is no vertue is needlesse and no part of pennance or satisfaction but a killing of ones selfe wherby they withdraw men from austerity strictnesse of life
we hould that it being vsed discreetly and in measure is good and pious as commended in the old and new testament and practised by all saints and holy persons therby animate all to it
they hould that the forsaking the world liuing in a retired religious life is a meere human tradition and an vnprofitable

of god
we hould that it is a meane of perfection an imitation of an apostolicall life and therfore co~mendable in them who can vndertake it
they hould that vowes of perfection are a curiosity presumption pride contrary to god not to be vsed by christians
we hould that to vow obedience pouerty and chastity are gratefull to god great helps and meanes to perfection as counsailed in holy scripture and laudable in all the professours of them
in all which as they take from all sinne all punishment due to it all offence to god inseparable from it and all malice annexed to it as they take away all difference by which one sin is damnable rather then another all feare which may bridle any from committing sinne in which they make men fearlesse of sinne and carelesse to commit it so they take from good works in generall all goodnesse and participation of good al iustice and vprightnesse before god all valew and dignity by grace all benefit and grace of merit all hope or comfort of pleasing god all necessity of doing them and all possibility of doing them without offence of god
and from good works in particuler they take away also from all vowes their obligation to be performed from chastity all possibility to be obserued from fasting pennance and mortification all necessity to be vsed from prayer and deuotion all meanes to obteine that they aske and from charity all efficacy to iustify before god and from all and euery one in their proper kind all power and necessity to do them all courage and alacrity to do them hopefully
al which is contrary in vs our catholicke doctrine

eleauenthly from the glory of heauen the ioyes of it they and their priuate spirit do derogate in affirming

that neither any reward is iustly giuen in heauen for any good done vpon earth nor any crowne of iustice in that life for suffering of iniustice in this nor any lawrell of martyrs confessours or virgins there for the confessing the name of christ

that in heauen are no differences of mansions or diuersity of degres of glory

and that all are like and al equall in glory and beatitude euen to the apostles and the mother of god wherby they remoue a strong motiue to draw men

to labour for perfection in this life that they may attaine to a higher place of glory in the next
we and our catholicke doctrine doe belieue
that god doth iustly reward in heauen all our good deedes done on earth and doth giue crownes of glory for our sufferings for him and bestow variety of glorious lawrels by gifts of accidentall beatitude for our glorifying him in any eminent manner of perfection

that as starres

so saints do differ in clarity hauing their seuerall mansions places and glory according to their degrees of grace and merit wherby al are encouraged to aime at perfection in hope of so high a remuneration

for hell and the place and paines of it they and their priuate spirit take from it
the difference of places as limbus patrum puerorum purgatory

the materiall and reall fier of hell denying as many do

all true fier

and admitting only a metaphoricall and imaginary fier
the suffering of soules in it before the day of iudgment

the corporall place or prison of hell admitting only a torment of co~science before the day of iudgment



the lawfulnesse to auoid sinne for feare of hell which they make a sinne and vnlawfull by all which they make the paines and torments of hell to be lesse feared and sinnes for the feare of them lesse auoided
we and our catholicke doctrine do hould
the difference of places according to different estates and deserts as the limbus puetoru for children dying without baptisme the limbus patrum for the faithfull dying before christ and purgatory for faithful dying without full satisfaction

the locall place and the materiall fier and the reall suffering of the present paines of hell by the soules of the damned and withall that it is a worke good though not the best to auoid sinne for feare of hell
in all which we extoll the iustice of

god mixt with mercy in punishing al sorts according to their deserts and deterre men from liberty of sinne for feare of punishment in hell

and thus we haue in this second part confuted this priuat spirit which in the former part we proued to be the sole and whole ground of the protestant faith and saluation
by authorities of holy scripture

by testimony of auncient fathers

by reasons drawne from the difficulty of discerning spirits

by reasons drawne from a right interpreter of holy scripture

by reasons drawne from an infallible iudge of controuersies of fayth

by reasons drawne from the nature and certainty of fayth

by circular absurdities to which this spirit leadeth

by doctrinall absurdities which follow vpon it and the doctrine of it against fayth and the creed against hope and the pater noster and against good life morall vertues the ten commandements and all laws of god· church or
in which also we haue made plaine how this their doctrine grou~ded vpon this their priuate spirit doth derogate from god and the blessed trinity whome it makes the authour of all sinne a sinner lyer dissembler and tyrant the only sinner and a greater sinner then either the diuell or man doth derogate from iesus christ and his birth life passion and resurrection whome it dishonours in making him neither phisitia lawyer iudge priest or perfect redeemer or sauiour but one ignorant impotent sinnefull and damned doth derogate from the church of god triumphant in heauen which it dishonours in taking from it knowledge charity in saints and angels and honour and reuerence to them and from the church militant on earth which it dishonours in taking from it all authority visibility vniuersality perpetuity or extancy and being vpon earth so many ages
how it derogates from fayth which it dishonours in taking from it all groundes whereon it is to be builded all meanes wherby it is to be attained and in making it contradictory rash presumptuous sinnefull and preiudicious to all hope and charity
how it derogates from man whome it disables depriues of all of all inherent grace of all good

life and workes of all possibility to obey gods commandements to abstaine from sinne to merit any reward
how it derogates from all morall vertues and good life from which by many principles it doth withdraw withall doth draw to all vice and wickednesse doth giue the reines to all epicurean liberty and loosenesse
in all which the spirit of our catholike church and the doctrine of it is shewed to be contrary and to giue honour to god to christ to his saints angels church to fayth sacraments and the rest
and to be a meanes to encourage all christians to the practise of all vertue and perfection and to auoid all sinne and wickednes
all this we haue carefully painefully laboured to performe in this second part of the treatise of that

the protestants obiections and proofes taken out of scripture for the defence of their priuate spirits authority to inrerpret scripture and iudge of controuersies proposed and answered
chap
of certaine obseruations profitable for the solution of obiections
sect

hitherto we haue battered that hope sufficiently the maine fabricke of this imaginary edifice of the protestant priuate spirit
it remaines only for this second part that we raze demolish the foundation vpon which this their conceit of their priuate spirits authority is built and erected that is that we solue the reasons or rather obiections taken out of

holy scripture vpon which they ground their conceit· for which we may note

that as our catholike doctrine doth not deny either the being or permanency of the spirit of god in euery faythfull both person and doctour for all faythfull by the spirit of god haue faith or the effect and operation of the same in assisting the in the finding out of the true sense of holy scripture for neither are the faithful prohibited from all reading nor the learned debarred from all interpreting of holy scripture so there is a great difference betweene the effect and operation of this spirit in the protestant and catholicke as well simple as learned as both do chalenge it and rely vpon it
for as for better illustration we may obserue in a naturall body and the spirit or soule of man

in which comparison we imitate
paul the soule or spirit doth giue information or operation to the whole body and euery part thereof yet· so that euery member hath not euery operation all members haue not one action but the head one as to iudge

the handes another as to worke the feet another as to walke and the mouth is to receaue the belly to containe

the stomake to disgest the meat and so it is proper to the eye to see to the eare to heare and to neither to discourse and reason which belongs only to the braine so in the spirituall body of the church and the faythfull members of it the spirit of god doth assist all and euery one in particuler

as well the meanest as the greatest as well the most simple as the most learned vvho are many but one body in christ yet so that as euery member is different one from another so the operation of euery one is different and not the same but as some are lay some ecclesiasticall persons some secular some religious some simple some learned

some common people some pastours and prelates so to euery one of vs is giuen grace according to the measure of the donation of christ according to the measure of fayth and to euery one for his profit that hauing all gifts according to the grace which is giuen to vs

euery one may remaine in the vocation in which he is called wherupon all are not prophets all are not doctours all are not euangelists all are not iudges of faith and interpreters of holy scripture

though all haue the spirit but god diuiding to euery one as he will

giues to some the spirit to heare and obey to others to direct and command to some the spirit to labour and worke by practicall offices to others to contemplate and study by speculatiue functions

yet to all so and in that manner that as euery member hath need of another for the eye cannot say to the hand stand in no need of thy helpe so euery one member hath his gift and the vse and operation of it for the benefite of the whole body with and subordination to the whole and according to the order and proportion of the whole that as the necessity and conueniency of the whole body doth require so the operation and function of the part is accommodated and applied and so all the parts and members of the church being by one spirit combined and vnited togeather as members of one body and in vnity of one hody do euery one belieue as they are directed by the head and do proceed in all with subordination to the head and worke in all for the vse and benefit of the whole suffer for the defence of the whole and so by a communion both with themselues and with the whole do all labour for the whole conserue the whole and keep still an vnion and communion with the whole and are directed according to the faith the rule the reason and the iudgment or direction of the whole body or church of christ
as long therfore as euery member and his spirit hath this direction subordination and vnion with the whole body of the church and the spirit of it so long doth it prooced in order and vnity and so farre it is agreable to the spirit of god directing his holy spouse the church but when this spirit doth beginne to be singular of it selfe to deuise a new doctrine to teach otherwise then the rule of faith hath prescribed or to assume the authority of a new maister when it deuides it selfe from the spirit of gods church and doth oppose it selfe against it or extoll it selfe aboue it when it will not be subiect and subordinate to it but doth erect a cathedra of authority of its own or an opinion of doctrine of its owne against it then it is an euident signe that it is not a spirit of vnity and concord but of dissention and diuision so not an inspiration of god to be imbraced but a suggestion of sathan to be reiected

out of which rule may be obserued the difference betweene a catholicke and a protestant spirit in expounding of scripture and withall

the weaknesse or rather impertinency of the protestant obiections for their manner of interpretation of scripture by this their spirit
for first we distinguish betweene them who without offence lawfully may expound and who by authority haue warrant infallibly to expound holy scripture
of the former sorts are all faythfull christians who hauing vnderstanding sufficient and a pious intention do with humility beginne and according to the rule of fayth proceed in seeking out the right sense of scripture and so none who are thus able and thus proceed are barred from either reading or expounding to their own co~fort the holy scripture as our aduersaries do falsely calumniate vs of the later sort are the pastours and prelates of the church who hauing lawfull ordination and succession

and continuing in vnity and subordination do either deliuer the sense of scripture as it is taught by holy church or els confirme and explicate any doctrine of fayth when they are collected in a generall councell
and these thus vsing the lawfull meanes and obseruing the vsuall rule of fayth haue authenticall warrant by the infallible assistance of the holy ghost that they cannot erre in deliuering any sense of scripture as a ground of fayth and beliefe
the protestants doe giue not only liberty but also authority to all not only pastours and prelates but also artificers and common people as well vnlearned as learned to frame to themselues such a firme assent to this or that seeming to them infallibly true sense of holy scripture euery one according to his owne preiudicate conceit or priuate spirit that thereupon they dare aduenture the certainty of their fayth and the hope of their saluation

secondly we make a difference betweene a sense of scripture produced in the schooles

to proue or confirme a schoole question a sense declared ex cathedra to ground an article of faith or betweene a preachers conceit deliuered in the pulpit to exhort to good life and manners and a doctrine proposed by the church as reuealed by god necessary to

be belieued
in which for the former we giue a liberty to any preacher to frame out of his own co~ceit any sense which not being opposit to true fayth may moue the auditory to piety good life but for the later we confine the ranging liberty of the wit

and inuention euen of the doctours pastours in gods church prescribe as fayth vincentius lyrin that· they teach that which is deliuered to them not which is inuented by them that which they receaued not that which they deuised that which is of publike tradition not of priuate vsurpation that of which they are not authours but keepers not beginners but followers not leaders but lead
in which cunningly caruing faythfully placing wisely adorning like another beezeler the pretious pearles of diuine fayth by adding splendour grace and beauty they are to illustrate more clearely that which was belieued more obscurely and to deliuer to posterity more fully explicated that which by their forefathers being not vnderstood was with reuerence belieued
alwayes so teaching that which they learned

that they teach after a new ma~ner but not a new doctrine
that is as afterward he sayth that they interprete the diuine canon according to the tradition of the whole church and the rules of catholike fayth that is vniuersality antiquity and consent and if any part do rebell against the whole or nouelty oppose antiquity or if dissent of a few controule the consent of all or the most then they preferre the integrity of the whole before the corruption of a part the veneration of antiquity before prophanation of nouelty and the generality of a councell before the temerity of a few

the protestants giue a liberty by the priuiledge of their spirit to euery not only preacher but priuate person to expound the most difficult and important places of scripture namely of the apocalyps pauls epistles not only for the schooles in scholasticall questions or in pulpit for exhortations to good life but in deepest articles greatest controuersies of fayth euery one as his spirit shall suggest and thereupon they direct them to ground their fayth the saluation of their owne soule and of many others who rely vpon them

whereby as sayth vincentius lyrinensis they make it a solemne practise to delight in prophane nouelties and to loath all decrees of antiquity and by making ostentation of a false opinion of knowledge do make shipwracke of all fayth

thirdly the spirit of a catholike will not presume to expound any text of scripture contrary to that sense which either the rule of fayth or the practise of the church

or the decree of a councell or the consent of fathers hath receaued as true and authenticall but in al will receaue follow that which is determined and decreed in the
the protesta~t spirit will censure reiect and condemne any sense though neuer so generally receaued or strongly confirmed by all authority of any church tradition councell or fathers and deuise a new one of his owne inuention and therby wil build a new fayth and religion which it perswades the followers to be the only way to truth and life

fourthly the spirit of euery catholike will deliuer his owne interpretation only as probable

and submit himselfe to the censure and iudgment of the spirit of the catholike church captiuating with paul his vnderstanding to obedience of fayth
the protestants spirit will auouch their interpretation as certaine infallible and of fayth and all with that obstinacy that no reason or authority shall remoue them from it or alter their opinion in it

fifthly the spirit of a catholike being setled grou~ded in a certainty of catholike and apostolike fayth

will expound scripture according to the rule of the same for the illustration or confirmation of the same fayth as it is generally receaued but will not ground himselfe and his beliefe in his owne exposition nor perswade and introduce a new beliefe vpon the same
the protestant spirit will ground it selfe and his first beliefe vpon his owne exposition and by the same perswade others to forsake their old fayth and to follow a new and so change the ancient religion for a nouell opinion grounded vpon a new exposition of any text of scripture framed according to the fantasy of the priuate spirits conceit
and thus though catholike doctours and pastours haue the spirit of god to expound holy scripture as much and more then the protestants haue yet they vse apply it either to and manners only or as probable and credible only or if to doctrine of fayth they apply it either to illustrate and confirme their fayth or if to

ground and settle it they square it according to the rule of fayth the practise of the ancient church the decrees of councells and the consent of fathers
all which the protestant doctour in the setling and resolution of his fayth reiects and relies his fayth vpon an exposition of scripture grounded only vpon his owne proper and priuate conceit

the obiections answered
sect ii

the obiections which the protestants luther melancthon

brentius magdeburgenses musculus whitaker other protestants do vsually make for the power and authority of this their priuate spirit to expound scripture are drawne some from those places which affirme the interpretation of scripture to be a guift that gratis and freely bestowed others from those places which require reading prayer or meditation in euery one for the obtaining of this gift
of the first sort are these and such like

first they obiect those places where the guift of

prophecy or interpretation of speaches is attributed to the operation of one and the same spirit which deuides to euery one as it will
where also prophecy that is interpretation of scripture preaching is giuen to the faythfull if all doe prophecy
euery

one hath a psalme hath a reuelation hath a tongue hath an interpretation
let prophets two or three speake and the rest iudge
you may all one by one prophecy that all may learne and all may be exhorted
therefore euery one who hath the spirit and grace of god hath the gift to interprete scripture
to which is answered
that in all those places paul speakes of guifts extraordinary

and gratis giuen for the tyme such as are the guift of languages the curing of diseases foretelling thinges to come and interpreting of obscure reuelations or mysteries which were bestowed only for a tyme and as personall vpon the apostles and first belieuers with whome they decayed and ceased not of any guifts ordinary and generall which are to be permanent in the church and common to all faythfull
therfore

these places can make nothing for euery faythfull persons power and ability to expound scripture

that so certainly that vpon it he may build his fayth and saluation

these guifts are not giuen any one of them to all persons nor yet all of them to any one person and that for all ends vses for the guifts are giuen according to the measure of fayth

according to the measure of the donation of christ according to the rule of fayth
therefore all these guifts are not alike giuen to euery one

but so distributed that some are apostles some prophets some euangelists others pastours and doctours

and not all apostles not all prophets not all doctours not all workers of miracles speakers with tongues or interpreters of speaches

therfore all and euery faythfull person hath not the guift of interpreting and expounding scripture but those vpon whome by speciall guift or function it is bestowed

they who haue this guift and the spirit of it haue it as subordinate and a part or parcell of the spirit of gods church by which it is to be directed not as opposite singular or independent of the same or of any one but themselues for so was the spirit of the prophets subiect to the prophets
that is

as chrysostome expounds it that both the prophet and his guift was subiect to the colledge or company of the prophets which is the whole church and the spirit of euery member is applyed to the vse and benefit of the whole body
what spirit therefore is priuate and proper as of it selfe and either diuided from the head or not subordinate to the whole body of the catholike church and applyed to the vse and benefit of the same that spirit is not the spirit of vnity and peace

but of diuision and dissention and so not the spirit of god who is not the god of dissention but of peace but of sathan

whose kingdome thus by spirits deuided will be made desolate and such is the spirit of all protestants as is before fully declared

according to which groundes are answered and explicated in particular all places which are obiected for this spirits authority
as first

that one and the same spirit doth work all these deuiding to euery one as it will is spoken first of reuelations and guifts extraordinary called gratis giuen not ordinary and permanent in the church of god such as is this

guift of interpretation of scripture

also it is spoken of persons priuate the vulgar sort vpon whome this extraordinary guift is sometymes bestowed not of the councels and prelats to whose function as proper to it this guift or promise is annexed
and if any priuate persons haue had this extraordinary guift as amos a sheepheard debora a woman who in the old testament were prophets and origen who not yet a priest was a doctour and interpreter of scripture they were priuiledges extraordinary and a few only which make not a generall rule for all and what they taught they taught not as maisters who did either arrogate to themselues any proper authority or did teach any new doctrine or did refuse any subordination to superiour authority but did it either to the consolation of themselues or to the instruction and confirmation of others and all according to the rule of fayth and common receaued doctrine
in which manner any though not yet called and hauing a talent sufficient may as before presume to interprete holy scripture and deliuer the sense of it to others though he haue not yet the grace of holy orders nor pastorall or episcopall function

secondly that of rom
hauing gifts according to grace which is giuen to vs differe~t whether prophecy according to the reason of faith or ministery in administring is not so meant that euery one according to the proportion of his faith hath the gift of prophecy or interpetation of scripture but that euery one who hath these gifts should exercise them according to the talent and guifts bestowed on them not presuming to be wiser then he ought but to be wise vnto sobriety and according to the measure of the donation of christ and not to intermedle in anothers office and function as to instance in the apostles example he who hath the ministery proper to deacons and inferior orders which was to distribute almes and to take care of the poore is not to medle in the function of bishops which is to preach and instruct in doctrine of faith to conferre orders but euery one according to the reason or measure of faith that is not of his infused and supernaturall faith by which he is disposed to grace but of his gift of vnderstanding of scripture and of high mysteries of beliefe is to proceed in

his function to vse that talent bestowed vpon them to the profit of the whole body
which gift also

as it is not a property inseparably annexed to grace for many who are in state of grace are destitut of this guift others who are not so holy but for life wicked often haue the benefit of it so it is not vsually bestowed vpon the vulgar and common sort of people but is proper to ecclesiasticall persons of whose function are two sorts that is episcopall

to preach and explicate holy scripture and diaconicall to minister in externall function of giuing almes seruing the poore and the rest

as is by the apostle heere expressed in which euery one remaining in his vocation in which he is called is to exercise his owne office and function
for as saith hierome it is not for euery one to try gold and expound holy scriptures to tast wine and vnderstand the prophets and apostles
and as saith paul all are not prophets nor apostles nor doctours but some prophets some apostles some euangelists some doctours till the consummatio of the world
and so some to whom by their function it belongs not all faithfull of what sort soeuer haue this gift of interpretation of scripture bestowed on them

thirdly those places of
cor
are vnderstood as the whole chapter is neither of any ordinary and infallible interpretation of holy scripture nor yet of any solemne and publicke office sacrifice or benediction of the masse

much lesse of any guift ordinary common to al euery faithfull person either for vnderstanding of scripture or for hearing the solemne seruice of the church as all expositours both ancient and moderne do confesse the very words of the text do conuince but of priuate praiers and praisings of god in hymnes canticles and spirituall songes and of priuate guifts of speaking with tongues and prophecying

or interpreting of holy scripture and exhorting for mutuall consolation and instruction one another
all which as they were guifts gratis giuen rare extraordinary singular

yea and miraculously bestowed vpon seuerall persons of sundry sorts in the particuler congregations and assemblies of the faithfull in those times and only for that present time and not to continue in the church so an order and methode is here prescribed in the

vse and exercise of these guifts by the apostle that al may be done honestly and according to order

without confusion and to edification specially of infidels not yet conuerted to whom co~ming to heare the exercises of the christians these were signes and testimonies of the spirit of god among christians
whereupon it is called undefined span alphabet

that is thy proper and priuate benediction and the prophets did speake somtimes in languages which neither themselues nor the auditours vnderstood as
and
is expressed where the speakers are willed to pray that they themselues may vnderstand and the prophecying or interpreting of high misteries is preferred before the vnknowne not vnderstood languages
for which we may note out of the auncient writers iustine martyr and tertullian who liued in the age of the apostles

that the times then so requiring it at the first begining of the church this order was obserued in the meetings of christia~s which were then for the place priuate as in time of persecution that is
the psalmes were sung
the prophecies and scripture was read


the sermon was made by the bishop

the sacrifice which consisted in the oblation consecration communion canon some short prayers was offered

the communion was giuen to all

some did sing hymnes and psalmes of praise and thankesgiuing others did prophecy speake of high mysteries and shew their guift of languages

others more spirituall did as they were inspired by speciall guifts interpret and expound scripture which was vsed euen by women
and lastly they concluded all with an agape or banquet of charity and hymnes of praising god so brak vp the assembly
which practise as it was only for that time and in time when these extraordinary and miraculous guifts were bestowed for it was not obserued in the future setled times of the church so with the cessation or ending of those guifts the order and manner partly ceased partly was changed into a set order forme for succeding times which conformably is obserued by our present church in practise as may be seene in cornelius vpon the
cor
nothing therfore in this chapter is intended or spoken of the generall and ordinary power and authority of all the common

people and euery persons spirit to interprete scripture and iudge of controuersies of faith


it is answered that the prophecy heere spoken of is not an interpretation of scriptures but of languages by which that which was spoken in strange languages to the admiration of infidels for whose conuersion the guift of tongues was giue was interpreted by this guift of prophecy in others for the instruction of the faithfull for whom this prophecy was giuen for languages are a signe to infidels but prophecy to the faithfull


when therfore the guift of tongues ceased this guift of prophecy also ceased as being giuen only for the interpreting of tongues


the matter and subiect both spoken by tongue and interpreted by prophecy was not doctrine or mysteries of faith but either exhortation to piety for edification and consolation

or of things secret as future euents or vnknowne faults or facts done by which the secrets of the heart of the infidell or idiot was made knowne and he conuinced and iudged of all

therfore it makes nothing for doctrine of faith and interpretation of scripture


this manner of prophecy howsoeuer and of whatsoeuer it was it was not independent and of it selfe free to interprete what and how it will but so that the rest doe iudge

that the spirits of prophets be subiect to the prophets


and so euery priuate spirit must be subiect to the iudgment of the church and the churches spirit

fourthly they obiect those places where it is said that all thy childre are taught of our lord

al shalbe docible of god

your selues haue learned of god

will giue my law in their bowels and will write it in their heart

all shall know me from the least to the greatest

if any will do his will who sent me he shall vnderstand of the doctrine whether it be of god

my sheepe do heare my voice do follow me

yow haue no need that any do teach you but as his vnction teacheth you of all things


all these places say do not either ioyntly altogether or particularly any one mention any priuiledge that euery one hath by the instinct of his owne priuate spirit to interprete holy scripture to decide deep mysteries of faith and to iudge of all controuersies

of diuinity which is the point auerred by the protestants denied by vs

and in controuersy betweene both

in them is affirmed only that god will giue his inward guift of grace to all sort of persons so sufficiently that they may know him his truth and the true way to saluation and by the same may obserue his commandements and come to be saued in which yet is neither excluded but rather supposed as precedent and an exteriour proponent cause the ordinary meanes of preaching by pastours and of instruction by them and subordination to them but yet is not giuen to any one any power or priuiledge to preferre his owne spirit before the spirit of the whole church or to censure the doctrine which is once adiudged by the same which among the rest this protestant priuate spirit doth assume to it selfe

for which we may note that it is one thing to haue faith sufficient for saluation another to haue the guift of infallible interpretatio of scripture
the former is a guift general to all the faythful though they be as yet

little ones who only sucke milke though they be as yet

carnal not spiritual thogh they be

ignorant of many things and haue many

thinges wanting to the perfection of their faith yet they be sealed with

the spirit of the promise

the pledge of our inheritance

haue the spirit of god dwelling in them and so haue the literall verity of all the former places verifyed in them
the later is a guift peculiar and proper only to them who by place and function are

spirituall and perfect haue their

senses exercised to the discerning of good and euill
and haue the guift of

discerning of spirits and interpreting of speaches
and these are they who as tryers and discerners of fayth interpreters of scripture and haue the guift and power infallible to direct others in the doctrine of fayth who are ex officio the pastours and prelates of gods church and are

as bishops to rule

to feed the flocke of christ

to exhort and reproue with all authority to

controule rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the fayth and

to denounce to certaine not to teach otherwise
and all by that power which god hath giuen them to

edification and to reuenge all disobedience and to bring into captiuity al vnderstanding to the obedience of christ
this

is the office of the prelates and bishops of gods church


this inward guift of grace or vnction of the holy ghost is only an efficient internall and cooperant cause and so necessary to mooue the vnderstanding and will to assent to that which as certaine is proposed but this iudge or interpreter must be an exteriour proponent cause which must deliuer to vs this sense as certaine which being proposed grace doth enable vs to belieue
now all these and such like places are meant of the interiour guift of grace which is necessary but not ordinarily sufficient without a precedent exteriour and proponent cause which is this infallible interpreter of holy scripture in pastours of the church

fifthly to those places where it is commanded not to belieue euery spirit but to proue the spirits if they be of god

and to proue all thinges and hould that which is good

is answered

that all and euery person of the body of the holy church is not directed to make this tryall but only the chiefe

that is the pastours and prelates as when a man is willed to discerne and see not euery member and part of the body is directed so to do but the chiefe members as the head which is to iudge and the eye to see to whose function it is proper and belonges or as when an vniuersity is directed to examine and iudge of such a booke and doctrine not euery student but the chiefe doctours of that faculty are so directed and willed so that not euery person and vnlearned party in the church is to make this tryall of spirits but only pastours and prelates to whose function it is peculiar and proper to iudge and decide all such like questions and doubts

this tryall and iudgment is to be made not of questions doctrine already decided and determined by the authority of the church but of such as are yet doubtfull and vndecided
for that which is once determined by the generall consent of the church or councell is not againe to be examined and iudged by any priuate mans spirit for so the decrees of cou~cells were both vaine endlesse that therfore is to be tryed which is not before both tryed and iudged and that by those who haue both ability and authority to do it which makes

nothing for this priuate spirit which will both try what is before by any councell iudged and will by euery simple vnlearned person try and iudge it

sixthly to that of
cor
the spirituall man iudgeth all thinges and himselfe is iudged of none it is answered that paul to confound the corinthians who standing vpon their humane worldly wisedome

contemned his vnlearned manner of instruction affirmes that they being men sensuall can iudge only of sensuall thinges but he being spirituall and perfect in diuine wisedome can iudge both of things sensuall and spirituall and so a spirituall man iudges of all thinges in generall that is both of spirituall thinges which are diuine and mysticall and also of humane thinges which are terrene and sensuall but a sensuall man iudges only of temporall thinges of the world and not of spirituall which are of god
the reason therfore is de generibus singulorum that a spirituall man iudges of all sortes of thinges both diuine humane but not de singulis generunt that he can iudge in particuler of all kindes or spirituall thinges as when a man is sayd to eat of all thinges it is meant that he eates of all kinds of meat both flesh and fish not of euery particuler peece of both


euery spirituall man doth iudge spirituall thinges but according to such rules and directions as euery thing is to be iudged that is thinges manifest and certaine he iudges according as they are iudged already and determined thinges vncertaine and obscure according to the rule of fayth and the authority and testimony of councels fathers tradition and church as before is explicated not according to his owne spirit and conceit in which his spirit is still subordinate to the spirit of gods church and directed by it


because euery faithfull christian is not alwayes spirituall that is perfect hauing his senses exercised in the discerning of good and euill for some haue need of milke and not of strong meat and euery one that is partaker of milke it vnskilful of the word of iustice for he is a child


therfore this iudgment especially of misteries of faith is not for al imperfect though

faithfull christians but only for persons spirituall that is perfect and vnderstanding in spiritual learning wisdome

and so it makes nothing for the priuate spirits iudgment in euery faithfull christian
and because spirituall persons haue not euery one a spirit for all spirituall things for to one certes by the spirit is giuen the word of wisdome and to another the word of knowledge according to the same spirit and to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits all which one and the same spirit worketh
and

all are not apostles prophets or doctours nor worke miracles do cures or speake with tongues

and because some me~bers are more some lesse honourable or base some more weake some lesse and some haue offices functions some more honourable some lesse some to see and direct others to walke and be directed

euery one according to his nature function though one and the same spirit worke all these therefore all persons who are spirituall haue not all spirituall offices guifts but some the guifts of prayer and contemplation some of mortification and humiliation some of obedience patience others of discerning of spirits and others to who by their office it belongs of iudging of faith and scripture as before
and therefore though spirituall men iudge all things spirituall and temporall yet euery spirituall man doth not infallibly iudge and discerne euery spirituall thing no more then euery faculty of the soule as sensitiue vegitatiue or rationall doth performe all and euery function of feeling growing and reasoning but euery one his proper function
and as the function of the eye is only to see and of the ha~ds to worke and the feet to walke so they who will giue the function of seeing and iudging of the sense of scripture and misteries of faith to euery person in the body of the church do as much as if one should attribut the function of seeing to the handes and feet for as in a body naturall so in the body mysticall which is pauls comparison some are principal members some inferiour so euery one hath his proper function in the church as the bishops are eyes to discerne truth the princes are armes to defend the body and the people are the rest of the parts of the body to be directed
the function therfore of one is not to be attributed to another but euery

one in his place and degree is to exercise his owne function in his proper office and worke
by which is apparent that those and such like places of scripture do make nothing for the authority and power of this priuate spirit in euery one to discerne and iudge of all places of scripture and misteries of faith except the protestants as they attribut to euery spirit power to do euery thing so they will out of euery place of scripture inferre any thing so ex quolibet proue quodlibet as their spirit doth direct and teach them
and thus much of the first manner of arguments or obiections drawne from the guift of the spirit of god and grace impertinently applied to proue this their priuate spirits authority

other obiections answered sect
iii

the second manner of obiections are drawne from the meanes which are prescribed in scripture for the due right vnderstanding of holy scripture which are prayer meditation and diligent seeking enquiring out the true sense of scripture out of scripture and such like by which the protestants seeme to backe much their spirits proceeding

for so doth caluin professe to imbrace that sense of scripture which by meditation annexed the spirit of god doth suggest by vertue of which spirit he contemns all what any humane wisdone can oppose
for which they obiect that dauid did meditat day night in the law of god
that timothy did from his childhood learne the scripture which might instruct him


that peter did will them to attend and looke into the propheticall word as to a candell shining in a darke place


that paul affirmes that faith faithful persons are built vpon the foundation of the prophets and apostles


that they of beroea did search the scriptures if the things were so

as paul did teach
and that christ did will the iewes to

search the scriptures

for all which we are to obserue
that these meanes are good and profitable but not sufficient of themselues for a certaine and infallible exposition of scripture for besides them is required the infallible assistance of the holy ghost for an infallible sense of scripture to be relied vpo

that these meanes are to be vsed by those who haue power and authority to expound scripture to whom though they be necessary yet are they not of themselues either sufficient or infallible either to euery priuate person or to others without other helpes and assistances of the holy ghost


that priuate persons when they vse apply duely these meanes may giue a probable exposition of scripture either for their owne consolation and confirmation in faith or for the edification and aduise of others but cannot rely vpon it either as a sole and solid foundation of their beliefe

or as a generall rule for the true and certaine exposition of all the difficult and abstruse places of scripture
for as augustine saith such is the profundity of holy scriptures that though his wit was better his leasure more and his diligence greater yet he might from his his old age profit in the vnderstanding of them not for that so much of them as is necessary to saluation is so hardly to be atteined but for that when once ones faith is grounded vpon them so many and manifold misteries remaine for the more intelligent proficients inuolued in the words and the that the aged witty and industrious may say when he is become perfect then he begins
for which elswhere he professes that he is ignorant of more things in scripture then he knowes
therfore only prayer meditation and study will not surfice for euery one to find out the true and certaine sense of euery place of scripture which for euery one to as+sume to himselfe would not be a certainty of faith but presumption of pride
and the same which is sayd of prayer

meditation

and study may be sayd of skill of tongues conference of originall texts and other places and of consideration of antecedents and consequents of phrases and the like
of which see stapleton
which supposed the answere to all the former obiections is facile

first dauid did read and study the scripture but he did it for his priuate consolation and meditation

not for his foundation in fayth in which he was before grounded

timothy did read and study them from his childhood but to learne the sense and meaning of them of his maisters and teachers not to be iudge and censurer of them and that for his instruction in manners not for his doctrine of fayth which he receaued from his ancestours not from his owne reading of scripture


peter did will them to attend to the propheticall doctrine but not to interprete it according to euery ones priuate spirit and proper interpretation which he forbids saying no

prophesy of scripture is made by priuate interpretation much lesse with a neglect of the rules and grounds of fayth or with a contempt of the pastours and superiours of the church of god preferring its owne before their exposition

paul affirmes that we must be built vpon the foundation of the prophets and apostles

that is not only vpon the written word of the apostles or prophets for many had fayth and were cittizens of saints and domesticals of god before any scripture or writing of the apostles was extant and many built their fayth vpon the apostles who writ nothing at all but vpon the doctrine and fayth reueiled to the apostles and by them left by preaching or writing to posterity

and as such by the church proposed to vs out of which nothing can be inferred for making the scripture much lesse the priuate spirit interpreting it the sole or sufficient ground of fayth
againe taking the foundation either for the doctrine or writinges of the apostles and they who are built vpon it or for principall partes or for the body of the church we may consider first the foundation of doctrine either in it selfe and so as being the truth reuealed it is the ground of fayth or in respect of vs as by vs it is accepted and so it relyes vpon the pastours and prelates of the

church by whome it is proposed to vs as reuealed and for whose authority we receaue it as reuealed

secondly we may consider the church either as it is the whole body of all faythfull in all tymes especially after the apostles and so it is built vpon the doctrine preached and written or as it signifies the first heads and directours of it to wit the apostles and so it is built immediatly vpon christ and the holy ghost reuealing to them that doctrin and scripture which they haue left to posterity and which they preach and propose to vs and in this sense the church that is the apostles and first pastours were before the doctrine was either preached or written by them so were the foundation of their doctrine and preaching of it to vs though to the rest of the faythfull the doctrine preached and written by them is the foundation vpo which their fayth is built
which answere doth not only cleare the scripture for hauing any priuate spirit as iudge ouer it but also declares how the church is built vpon the doctrine of the apostles or prophets taking the prophets eyther for the writings of the prophets in the old testament or for the interpreters of the apostles writing in the new and also how the church in the sense before declared is the ground of the apostolical and propheticall doctrine reuealed to the church and the first pastours of it and by them left to vs who receaue it from them and their authority and so from the church

they of beörea did search the scriptures whether those thinges were so as paul declared

that is not so

that by searching the scripture they did make themselues and their spirit iudge of the apostolicall doctrine preached out of scripture but so that either being nor yet fully conuerted and satisfyed they would with diligence and in humility enquire further of the doctrine preached which is alwayes permitted and aduised to all for otherwise he that giueth credit quickly is light

of hart or that being satisfyed they would as catholicke doctours do search out conferre and vnderstand those places of scripture which paul did alleadge and thereby the more strongly confirme themselues and better satisfy others in fayth
in which as they did proceed prudently and piously

and we permit and aduise euery learned catholike to do the like so they did no more make either their spirit or the scripture interpreted by their spirit iudge of the apostles doctrine then if one for searching the testimonyes of augustine which are cyted by bellarmine should therby be sayd to make himselfe iudge of bellarmine his doctrine or as one searching the places cited by caluin to see if they be as they are by him cited should thereby make himselfe iudge of caluin and his doctrine
which to inferre out of their actions as it is absurd so is it to inferre that the beröeans made themselues iudges of pauls doctrine out of the beröeans seeking out the places which paul alleadged

our sauiour willed the iewes to search the scripture it is true but which iewes to wit

those who were learned and how not so that he would make them and their priuate spirits iudges of scriptures

or the truth found in them but that he would haue them being yet incredulous studiously to informe themselues of him being the true messias out of those scriptures which they belieued already to be true and to beare true witnesse of the true messias which is no more then to persuade any protestant to read scriptures fathers and catholike authours and out of them to informe himselfe of the verity of catholike religion which is to search out the truth and not to make himselfe and his priuate spirit iudge of the grounds of truth or of the truth which is to be found in the
and this is all that can be inferred out of these places this may suffice for the solution of all such argumnets or obiections as are made out of scripture by the protestants for the establishing of this priuate spirits power and authority to interprete scripture and to iudge of al controuersies of fayth

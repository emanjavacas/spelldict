¶A moste necessary treatise of free wil, not onlye against the Papistes, but also against the Anabaptistes, which in these our daies, go about to renue the detestable heresies of Pelagius, and of the Luciferians, whiche say and affirm, that we be able by our own natural strength to fulfil the law and commaundementes of God.
¶Made dialoge wyse by Ihon Veron, in a manner word by woorde, as he did set it forth in his lectures at Paules.
¶To the righte honorable Lorde, my Lorde Robert Dudly, master of the horses, and knight of the most honorable order of the Garter.
Ihon Veron wisheth grace, peace of conscience, with encrease of honor, from God the father, through his son Iesus christ our Lord.
FOr, as much, as haue all ready set fourthe, the doctrine of predestination, and of the deuine prouidence of God, wherein haue strongly proued by manifest textes of the scriptures, and sufficient authorities of the aunciente wryters of the primitiue church, that God hath from the beginninge, ordayned and appoynted some, for to be felow heyres with his sonne Iesus Christ, of his heauenly kingdome, and some again to be euerlastinglye dampned in hell fire: and that whome he hath ordeined before, to
enioy and possesse euerlasting life, them he hathe chosen in hys sonne Iesu Christ, afore the foundacions of the worlde were laide, whiche thynge he dyd of hys free mercye and goodnesse, and withoute anye respecte at all of their owne deseruinges or merits, for to setforthe ye glory of his grace, to declare hys mercy throughe oute al the whole world: but whome he hath apoynted to be the vessels of hys wrathe, them he hathe accordinge to hys ryghteous and vnserchable iudgemente styrred vp for to be the examples of hys iustice, and for to be glorifyed by their dampnatyon, wherin he dothe them no manner of wrong, sithe that he rewardeth them, accordinge to theyr naturall corruption, whiche they haue of their parent Adam, wherbi we are all in generall, subiecte to euerlasting damnation, so yt if he shoulde damne vs all, he shoulde do vs but right, and no iuste occasyon at all,
could we haue, to complain of him or of his most righteous iudgeme~t haue thought it good and expedient, for to adde vnto it, the mooste necessarye doctrine of free wyll.
Whiche as it dothe altogether depend of the other, and is most surelye grounded in it, so it can not be substantially vnderstanded, wythout some sight and knowledge of the same, as it doth euidentlye appeare by those, which plainely affyrme that, onlesse we haue free wyl, vertue shall not be rewarded, nor the workes of the saints crowned: which if they would consyder from what beginning, the doctrin of Predestination dothe fetche the glorye of the saintes, they shoulde sone espy out theyr owne erroure.
Whome (sayeth the Apostle) God hathe chosen, them did he cal, who~ he hathe called, them did he iustifye, and whome he hathe iustified, them did he glorify.
because forsothe, that by the fre mercye of God, and not by theyr owne industry, they be both chose~, called and iustified.
Heare doe we learne, in these fewe words, that all the hole glory of our saluation, ought only to be geuen and attributed vnto the free election of God, whereof doth proceade, come and sprynge, bothe the will and power, that we haue, to do any thing, that is good and acceptable before the maiestye of our heauenly father.
Yea before we be renewed by the holy ghost, and made newe creatures in oure sauioure Iesu Christe, we are the seruauntes of synne.
What fredome then canne we iustlye boaste or bragge of? Vbi spiritus domini, sayeth saynte Paule, ibi libertas: where the spirite of the Lorde is, there is libertye and fredome.
Againe: Si vos filius liberauerit, vere liberi eritis, that is to say:
If the sonne doth delyuer you, ye shall be free in deede.
These sayinges, do sufficiently declare, that as long as we are voide of the spirit of God and are not yet set at liberty by the sonne, we are nought els but the bond slaues of Sathan the dyuell of syn of deathe.
Many other places of ye scriptures, might heare aleadge, which do teache that of oure selues, we be not able to think a good thought.
But lest, should be tedious vnto your honorable Lordship, wyll omytte them, and shew brieflye, what the Concil of Myluente did most godlye and catholikely decree and determyne touching this matter:
If any man (saye the holye fathers gathered in that Concyll) dothe affyrme,
that we canne by the vertue and strength of oure owne nature thinke or chuse, as it is expedyente, anye good thynge that pertayneth to oure saluation, or agree and consent to the wholesome
preachinge of the gospell, without the illuminating, and inspiration of the holye ghost, who geueth vs a pleasure or swetnesse in consentinge, and the truthe in beleuinge, he is deceaued with an heretical spirit, not vnderstanding the voyce of God, sayinge in the gospell: without me, ye can do nothinge,
where he sayeth: Not that we be able to thinke any thinge of oure selues, as of our selues, But our suffiencye or ablenesse is of God.
Again: If any man doth contentiouslye maintaine, that God doth tarye for oure wyll, that we maye be purged from synne, and doth not confesse, that by the infusion and working of the holy ghost it is wrought in vs, that we be willing to be purged, he doth resiste withstand the holy ghost him self, sayinge by Salomon: The wil, is prepared of the lord.
that worketh in vs both the wyll, and the worke, according to his good wil. Wher the Apostell doth sufficientlye shewe, that the wil it selfe, is made good in vs, by the workinge of God.
For, if we shuld aske, whether the good wil, is a gift of god, or not, maruail, if any man dirst say nay.
Moreouer (say the fathers afore reherced) If any man dothe saye, that the grace of God, can be geuen by humaine inuocation, or mans calling vpon god, not that the grace it selfe dothe worke or bringe to passe, that God is called vppon of vs, he dothe gaynesaye Esaye the prophet, or the Apostell speaking the same: am founde of them, that soughte me not, and dyd appeare playnely vnto them, that dyd not aske of me.
What canne be spoken more playnelye of the vnablenesse of manne afore hee be regenerated or borne of newe by the spyryte of God?
All men maye easely see by these sayinges, whiche are moste surely grounded in the worde of the lyuinge God, what wyl and strengthe we haue of oure selues, to doe any thinge, that pertaineth eyther to the glory of God, or to our own saluation.
Therefore, can not but maruaile at our pope pelagians and at the viperous broode of the fre wyll men whych do styll to the greate iniurye of the gratuite and free grace of God,
so set oute boast and aduaunce the free wyll and strength of man, whyche (as sainte Augustyne sayeth) is verye sore hurte and wounded, whych is all to shaken, and lost, hauinge more nede of a true confession tha~ of a false defence.
Against the~ now at this present, beinge forced thervnto by the great loue vehement zeale that beare vnto the truth, haue taken vppon me for to wryte, that so maye somewhat releue and helpe the poore simple
and ignoraunte, whome by theyr pestiferous doctrine they cause for to leaue the sure stai,
that we haue in the free mercy and grace of god and to leane vpon the broken rede of theyr free will.
Whyche is the next way, that Sathan the deuell, the enemy of our saluation can deuise, for to throw them headlonge into the bottomlesse pit of eternall dampnation.
Theyr argumentes, which they do so gaily paynt out, wyth wrasted textes of the scryptures, haue diligently confuted, not sticking, as occasion did serue, to borowe of other, whiche haue foughte agaynst that monstruous heresye before me, those thynges, whych iudged mete for my purpose.
For, when we haue an enemy to ouercom, it maketh no matter whether we ouercome hym, wyth newe weapon, that was neuer occupyed before, or wyth a weapon that hath bene all readye occupyed of other.
warres, what dothe it skill, whether we beate downe the common ennemy, with our owne weapon, or with our felowes weapon? So that he be beate~ down ouercom, it is all one thinge.
We al oughte to seeke the glorye of God, and to fyght agaynste the common ennemy of it, let vs not therfore enuye one at an other, but let vs faithfully helpe, aide, chearishe and comforte one an other in this pearyllous fyght.
As for my parte, am ready at all times, in thys so iust a warre against the ennemies of the grace of God, to retch forthe myne helpyng hande vnto all my faythfull brethren, trustinge that they wyll doe the like vnto me.
Howe muche, haue farthered nowe the cause of the truthe, lette the godlye iudge.
Onlye this shall be to desire your honorable Lordshyppe to accept this my rude labor, whiche withall due submiffion offer vnto youre honoure, as vnto the
Mecenas and patron of all godlye learninge and true religion, beseching almighty God the authoure of al goodnesse, to prosper al your godlye enterprises to his honoure and glorye, and to the common wealth of this floryshynge realme.
IN this disputatyon or dyscourse of free wyll, we doe fyrste speake of it, as it was in man at hys fyrst creation, and afore his fall, where it is shewed, that the place that is aleadged out of the .xv. chapiter of Ecclesiasticus, for the defence of free will, oughte to be vnderstanded of manne being in the estate of innocencye.
For, then as S. Augustine dothe declare, hadde he free wyll, but by transgressing the lawe of God, he dyd lose it.
Whereby he did bothe bryng hym self, and all hys posterity into a miserable bondage, and thraldome.
In the whiche we doe still remaine vntyll the sonne of God, by his holye spiritte hathe made vs free.
For tyll then we are so pressed downe with the seruytude of sinne, and with the corruptyon
of oure owne fleshe, that we cannot as much as thincke a good thoughte, ye we runne headlonge into all kindes of sinnes, beynge mooste prompte and readye to doe what so euer the fleshe and the deuil do moue, and tempte vs vnto.
But after that we be once by the drawinge of the father, come vnto oure sauioure Iesu Christe, and haue fellowshyp wyth hym, then do we by and throughe him, recouer that, which we lost in Adam, but yet not so, that we be alwayes able to do the good, that we wold.
do not the good thing, which wold, but the euel that woulde not, that do I.
To be shorte, after longe disputation, and many obiections made by the aduersaries, and substantially answered by Gods word, and authorities of the auncient fathers, it is in fine concluded that all the good that we do, commeth nether of our
fre wyl nor of our owne strength, but of the mercy and grace of god, who worcketh the same in vs by his holy spirite, and that all the euill that is in vs cometh of the deuil and of our selues.
Laste of all, mention is made of the lawe, and of the fulfilling of the same.
Wher it is plainlye proued, that no man is able to fulfil the law with such a perfection as God dothe requyre of vs, and yet that no vnrighteousnesse can be laid to god, although, he commaundeth thinges, that be impossible for vs to do.
By ye way the righte vse of the lawe, and the vtility and profit of it, is diligently setforthe, and by what meanes we are delyuered from the curse of the same.

Ye may order vs, as it pleaseth you, and specially, syth that ye be so ready alwayes to geue place vnto the truthe.
And therfore, let vs hear what those thynges be, that do yet trouble your conscyence, that we may, as we haue done here to fore, mynister vnto you, the salue of Gods worde.

geuinge thee moste hartye thankes for these thy benefyttes, wherewith thou hast so graciouslie refreshed vs, we do humbly beseche thee, to sende thy holy spyrit in to oure heartes, that we may in this our communycation and talke, setfourth thy glorye onely, to the vtter confusion and ouerthrowe of al the shamefull enemyes of thy free mercye and grace.
For, there be manye in the worlde, which are suche enemyes
that whosoeuer doth accordinge to the scriptures, affyrme or say, that we are saued only by his free mercye and grace, they are most ready to persecute them wyth fyer and swerde, as most pernicious and abhominable heretykes, and as vtter enemies of all truth.
Ye shall not onely fynde of them amonge the papystes, but also amonge them, that wyll be coumpted most perfect christians, most earnest fauourers of the gospel.
Where so euer they he found, my faythfull guydes dyd tel me, that we haue fre wil: whiche thing ye do all denye.
Therefore: would fayne hear, what ye can say, concerning that matter.
What doe they vnderstand by fre wyll? For, they are wonte to speake of it many and sondry wayes.
Some do by it vnderstand one thyng, and some an other.
that by free wyll they do vnderstande a certaine facultye or power, beynge in seperably in the will of manne, wherby he mighte do or leaue vndone any maner of thinge, as wit and reason dyd thinke or iudge it expediente.
For, saye they, manne by hys wit and reason dothe consyder, weyghe, and ponder a thynge, and dothe examyne and trye whether it be good or not: and then by the vertue of hys free wyll, eyther he dothe it, or leaueth it vndone, euen as it pleaseth hym.
As it appeareth both by that difynition, and also by other talke, that they hadde afterwardes, their meaninge was, that we are masters of oure owne wyll and iudgement, and that therfore, we canne by oure owne strengthe turne oure selues whiche waye we lyste, that is to say, that we be able
what blasphemye is this against God and his worde? If ye do well marke this defynition, ye shall easely perceiue, that it is rather the difynition of prophane and heathenyshe Philosophers than of Christen doctours.
Ye maye well vnderstande, that if this definition wer true, we shuld not neede to pray vnto God for his helpe assistaunce, nor to call vpo~ him for his holy spirit.
We shoulde haue no nede to saye: if it pleaseth God we wil do this thing or that thing.
Do thei not the~ bi their definitio~ place ma~ in the stede roume of god? PH.
If these faithful guids of yours, had any zeale to setforthe the grace of God, his free mercy goodnesse, they wold haue geue~ an other definitio~ vnto free wil. AL.
They wold at least haue geuen the definition that s. Augustine doth vse.
Which is this: Liberum arbitrium, est facultas rationis et voluntatis, qua bonum eligitur gratia adsistente, malum vero ea desistente.
That is to saye: free wyll is a vertue or power of the reasonne and wyll, whereby the good is chosen, when the grace of God dothe adsiste, and the euill when it is awaye or is wythdrawen.
that by free wyll, if we haue the adsistaunce and healpe of the grace of God, we are able to chuse that, whiche is good, but if the grace of God be awaye, or be withdrawen, we can no more but embrace that, whiche is euyll, and hurtefull to oure owne soules.
[Que&stion And is there none other definition of fre wyll? PHILALETHES.
For, the master of Sentences, dothe wryte, that it is not sayed, that man hathe free wyll, because that he is as able to thinke and doo good, as he is to thinke do euyll, but because that
that the euyl, which man doth, he doth it frely, and wythout compulsion.
And therefore, the schole men saye, that this fredome and libertye is not letted, thoughe we be wicked, and seruauntes of sinne, and can no more but synne stil and offend.
But truely this ca~not be vnderstanded of a man, that is regenerated or borne of newe.
For, the holy ghost, that is in him dothe wythstande the euil, that he would do.
And likewise by this definition or determinatyon of the master of sentences, it myghte be said, that a man, which is regenerated or borne of newe hathe free will,
because that the same lyttle good that he doth, he doth it frely, and frankly.
a place out of Ecclesiasticus, otherwyse called Iesus the sonne of Sirach, wher it is thus written: God made man from the beginning and lefte him in the hande of his counsaill.
If thou wylt obserue the commaundementes and kepe acceptable faythfulnesse for euer, they shall preserue the.
He hath set fyer and water before thee, reache oute thine hande vnto whiche thou wilte.
Before manne is life and death, good and euyll, loke what him liketh, shalbe geuen him.
They did also aleadge many doctours, as Ierome against the Pelagians, where he sayeth thus: In this doo we dyffer from brute beastes, that we haue bene created with free will.
Which all do affirme that man hath suche free wyll, as they did declare vnto me afore.
that they aleadged out of Ecclesiasticus, maketh nothinge for them.
it oughte to be vnderstanded of man being in the fyrst estate of his creation, and beynge in his originall innocency and righteousnesse.
And because that it shall not bee thoughte, that bringe any thing of mine owne heade, ye shall heare what Saynte Augustine sayethe, whose wordes, are these: free wyll before the fall was an vprighte free wyll,
before whiche, fyer and water was layed of God, and the fyrste manne dyd reatche hys hande to whyche he woulde, hee dyd choyse fier, and forsoke water.
See the ryghteous iudge, the same, whiche manne beinge free dyd choyse, he dyd receaue, he woulde haue euyll, and the same did folowe him.
And in an other place, these be also hys woordes: saye that fre wyl was in that man, which
For, he was so made, that nothinge coulde withstande hys wyll, if he would haue kepte Goddes commaundementes but after that hee hadde synned throughe free wyll, hee dyd cast vs all that come of hys stocke, into necessitye.
that manne vsinge not well free wyll, did bothe lose it him self.
Againe: It is true (sayeth he) that manne when he was made did receaue greate strength of free wyll, but he did lose it through synne.
These autorityes of Sainte Augustine doo sufficientely declare, how the place that they aleaged oute of Ecclesiasticus oughte to be vnderstanded.
For, there doubtelesse, the wise manne dothe speake of man, as he was first created in the estate of innocency and righteousnes, and not
whereby as Saynte Augustine saithe, all menne haue loste theyr naturall possibilitye, or ablenesse, and theyr naturall or originall innocencye.
And so ought the doctoures, that they dyd bryng in, for them selues, to be vnderstanded, for they do all speake of manne as he was afore his fall.
Whyche thynge appeareth to be moste true by the saying of Saint Hierome,
who wrytinge vppon Ieremy saithe plainly these wordes: And therefore, the heretykes be wonte to promyse felicity, and to open vnto sinners the kingdom of heauen, saying: Thou maist folowe the maiestye of God, and be without synne, syth that thou hast receyued the power or strength of free wyll, and the vnderstandyng of the lawe, whereby thou arte able to obtayne what so euer thou wylte.
And so the saide Heretykes do deceyue the poore, symple, and
ignoraunt personnes, and specially women, whyche beynge loden with sinnes, are ledde to and froe with euerye winde of doctrine, deceiuynge by theyr flattery al them that geue eares vnto them.
Heare ye see that saint Ierome dothe call them all Heretikes, that saye, that menne be able by theyr free wyll, to do bothe good and euyll.
Wheruppon we maye well conclude, that in his Epistle ad
he dothe speake of the fyrste estate of manne, that he was in afore hys transgressyon and fall.
And as for Chrisostome, although he dothe exceade in extollynge the naturall strengthe of manne,
yet dothe he confesse plainelye, that euerye manne, is not onely of hys owne nature a synner, but also that he is synne altogether.
Whereby he doth ouerthrow, what so euer, he dothe wryte or saye in anye other place, in the commendacyon of free wyll, and
For, if accordynge to his owne sayinge, we be not only sinners of our owne nature, but also synne all together, where is oure gaye payncted free wyll become?
Dothe not the truthe hym selfe saye, that euery man that sinneth, is a seruaunte of synne? Againe, is it not wrytten that of whome so euer a manne is ouercome,
vnto the same he is in boundage? It appeareth then by thys, that we are verye farre from that liberty and fredome, that they doe so muche boaste of.
Wherefore did then these ancient fathers and wryters of the Catholike churche extoll so muche the free will and naturall strengthe of manne?
For, Chrisostome, hath alwaies in his mouth: Let vs bring that, whiche is oure own, God wyl supply the residue.
Where vnto Ierome doth agree, saying: Nostrum est incipere, dei autem perficere: Nostrum est, offerre quod possumus, illius implere quod non possumus.
That is to saye: It is our part for to begin, and it is Gods parte for to performe.
It is our parte, to offer that, whiche we can, and it is his part to supply or fulfyll that, that we can not.
that they did it to thys end, that they might driue awaye all slouggishnesse from menne.
And therefore, they did attribute so muche to the free will and naturall strength of man, that the fre mercy and grace of God was in a manner vtterlye forgotten.
Howe can it be proued, that they did tt onlye for that purpose? PHILALETHES.
meane as they write, they shoulde directly be against the plain scriptures and worde of God, and also against them selues.
Fyrst and foremost, the LORD him selfe saieth: wyll hencefourth curse the earth no more for mans sake.
For, the ymagination of mannes heart is euyll, euen from the very youth of him.
how vnable we be of oure selues to vnderstande heauenlye thinges, doth saye plainlye these wordes: Ye haue seene all that the Lorde did before youre eyes in the lande of Egipte, vnto Pharao and vnto and all his seruaunts.
And yet vnto this day, hath not the Lorde geuen you a harte, that vnderstandeth, eies that see eares that heare.
What could he saye more, excepte he shuld call vs blocks and stones? And in Ezechiel the Lorde sayeth: new heart,
As for that stony hearte, wyll take it oute of youre bodye, and geue you a fleshy hart.
will geue you my spirit amonge you, and cause you to walke in my commaundements, to kepe my lawes and to fulfyll them.
This place onely doth sufficientely teache vs, that excepte oure stony heartes be taken away from vs, and flesshy, that is to saye, obediente hartes geuen vs in stede of them, yea and a newe spirit put in to vs (whiche shoulde worke in vs an obedience towards the Lordes commaundementes) we are able to do nothing we can in no wyse kepe the lawes of God, nor yet fulfyll them.
For, by them we do learne, that all that we haue of oure owne, must either be renewed, or taken away, afore that we canne do any thinge, that pertaine to oure saluation.
any man may easlye perceaue, that the liberty and freedome that we haue to do well, is very small, or rather nothing at all.
Be not these the wordes of Iohn zacharyes sonne: man can receaue nothinge, except it be geuen him from aboue? Wher doubtlesse he speaketh, not of the comon giftes of nature, but of the speciall gyfte of the holye ghost.
For, there dothe he complain; that his disciples were neuer the better for all hys preachinges, wherein he had set fourthe Christ vnto the~.
As if he shoulde haue sayed: do see and perceaue, that woordes are nothinge auaileable for to teach and instructe menne in heauenlye thynges, excepte the holye ghost, woorkynge inwardelye dothe geue the vnderstanding.
when hee sayethe: No manne canne come vnto me, excepte it be geuen him
For this cause, when Peter hadde sayed: Thou arte Christe the sonne of the lyuinge God.
This aunswere dyd oure sauioure Iesus Christ make vnto him agayne: blessed art thou Simon the sonne of Ionas: For, fleshe and bloude hath not opened that vnto thee,
And in an other place: whosoeuer (sayeth he) dothe heare and learne of the father, cometh vnto me.
But the blessed Apostell doth most strongely heate downe the vayne pride of oure free wyll men, wher he writeth on this manner: The naturall man perceaueth nothing of the spirit of God.
Whereby he doth vnderstande, that the naturall man, which is not renewed in Christ, can not perceiue the things that be of ye spirit of god.
And in his second Epistel to ye Corinthians, these be also his words:
Such trust haue we through christ to God ward, not that we are sufficient of our selues to thincke any thing, as it were of our selues, but our ablenesse commeth of God.
Nowe if we be not able to thynke a good thought, except God dothe put it in vs: howe muche more vnable be we, ether to wil or to do any thing that good is, or acceptable in the sight of God? But let vs graunt vnto you by way of disputation and reasoninge, yt we haue no such thing in the boke of God: what shall they winne by it? For, am able to bring nowe, foure of the most principal doctors against theyr two.
who is a most aunciente doctor, hathe lefte thys golden sentence vnto vs by wryting: De nullo nobis gloriandum est, quia nihil nostrum est, nisi vt
homo apud se prorsus exinanitus, a deo totus pendere discat.
That is to say: we oughte to boste of nothinge: For, nothing is our owne, sauing only that man being of no reputation with hym selfe, muste learne to hange all to gether of God.
As farre, as doe remember, Saint Augustyne dothe many times rehearse the same saying of Cyprian.
For, he maketh mention of it in hys booke of the Predestination of saintes, and in manye other places besydes.
But he hym self doth wryte much after the same manner, when he sayeth.
de suo Sathanas est: id vnde beatus est, a deo tantum habet.
Quid N. de tuo habes nisi peccatum? Tolle tibi peccatum quod tuum est.
Let no man flatter him felfe: for, of hys owne he is a very Sathan he hath that of God only, wherby he is blessed.
For, what haste thou of thyne owne but sinne? Take awaye synne from thee, whiche is thine owne: For, righteousnesse is of God.
Ye see howe well he dothe setforthe manne in hys owne coloures.
Sciunt sancti viri (sayeth he) se post primi parentis lapsum, de corruptibili stirpe editos, et non virtute propria, sed preueniente gratia superna, ad meliora se vel vota, vel opera commutatos, et quicquid sibi mali inesse cognoscunt de mortali propagine sentiunt meritum.
Quicquid vero boni in se inspiciunt, immortalis gratiae cognoscunt donum.
That is to say: holy men do know that after the fall of the fyrste father, they be borne of a corruptible stocke, and that they be not by
theyr owne vertue, but by the supernall grace, that dothe preuent them, turned vnto better desyres or woorkes: and what euyl so euer they knowe to be in them selues, they feale that it is deserued and come of theyr mortall kynde.
But what good so euer they see to be in them selues, they acknowledge to be the gyft of the immortal grace.
And for this gyfte that they haue receyued, they be debtoures vnto hym, whych by preuentyng them, dyd geue vnto theym, that they shoulde wyll that good thynge, whyche they woulde not, and by followinge did graunte that they shuld be able to do that good thing that they would.
woulde haue alwayes this sayinge of Gregorye before their eies.
For, they learne thereby, that they that be sanctifyed by ye holi gost, as thei do acknowledge that after the fal of the fyrste man,
they are bothe conceiued and born in sinne, so do they vnfainedly confesse, that all the good mynde and will, that they haue to doe those woorkes, that God dothe requyre of vs, commeth not of them selues, nor of theyr owne naturall vertue and stre~gth, but of the mere grace and goodnesse of God, wherewith he dothe preuent them, that they maye haue suche a good wyll and mynde to do good, and wherwyth he, as followinge, he dothe healpe and adsist them, that they maye be able to fulfill and perfourme that good thinge, that he hathe moued them to will.
Againe, the euil that they feele to be in them selues, they doe not abscribe it vnto their creation, nor yet to theyr creatoure and maker, but to theyr mortall generatyon, and corrupted nature: but all the goodnesse that they perceiue to be in the~ selues, they attribute it not vnto their natural vertue stre~gth
but vnto the grace and goodnesse of God, withoute whiche we can not as muche, as thincke a good thoughte.
And therefore, Bernarde doth write verye well when he sayeth on this maner: Quid igitur? Hoc ergo totum liberi arbitrii opus,
Non quidem quod velcon fensus, in quo omne meritum con sistit, ab ipso sit: cum nec cogitare, (quod minus est quam conse~tire) a liquid a nobis, quasi ex nobis sufficientes simus.
Verba sunt non mea, sed Apostoli, qui omne, quod bonum esse potest, id est cogitare, et velle perficere, pro bona voluntate, attribuit deo, no~ suo arbitrio.
That is to say: what then? Is this therfore ye whole work of fre wyll? Is this the only merit of it, that it dothe consente, and agree? Truly it is.
Not that the consent, wherin all the merit doth consist, doth come or is of it: syth that we
be not of our selues, as of our selues able to thinke any thing, whiche is lesse than to consent or agre.
Theese be not my wordes, but the wordes of the Apostle, which doth attribute vnto God, and not vnto hys free wyll, all that be good, that is to saye: to thyncke, and to wyll, and to perfourme accordyng to his good wyll and pleasure.
Here do we learne that Bernard doth adscribe al thynges vnto god, and nothing to fre wil: wherin he doth agree with S. Augustin,
sayinge: God dothe so woorke in the hartes of men, and in the fre wyll it self, that euerye good thoughte, godly counsel, and al good motion of the wil or minde is of God.
[Obiectio~ My faithfull guydes did tel me, that these be S. Augustines wordes: who of vs all wyll say that throughe the sinne of the fyrst manne, fre wyll is pearyshed from mankinde? It appeareth by thys, that notwithstandynge the
fall of the fyrst man, we haue free wil stil.
Yea doe remember, that these woordes are also aledged out of S. Augustin: Let no man be slack and slouthful to serue God, nor trust so vppon grace,
as though God shuld not require the workes of his fre will: yea rather, let him shonne euill and do good.
No man can deny but that theese be S. Augustines wordes.
Wherby he doth plainly declare, ye God doth require the workes of our fre wil.
Which thing, he wold not do, except we had it.
It is a wonder to se howe craftye the deuil is, [Aun&swer both in wrasting of the scriptures, also in peruerting of thancient fathers.
In the firste sentence, that oure brother Albion dyd aleage,
For, al that doth declare most plainelye the righte meanynge of Saint Augustin, the same do they mooste craftely leaue of.
And because no man shal thincke, that goe about to sclander them, ye shall heare al the hole sentence of that auncient doctour,
which is this: who of vs wil say, yt through the sinne of the first man, fre wyll is pearished from mankind? Truely, the fredome is pearished throughe sinne: but the same that was in Paradise, to haue ful or perfect righteousnesse with immortality: Therefore mannes nature hathe neade of the grace of God, as oure sauioure Iesus Christe doth testify, saying: If the sonne of god doth deliuer you, then are ye free in deede, to liue wel and iustly.
For, free wyll is not so pearyshed vnto sinners, but that they sinne throughe it, specially al those, that sinne wyth pleasure, and throughe the loue that they haue vnto synne, whyche they do desire, and whiche pleaseth them.
Fyrst, he saithe that the same fredome is pearyshed gon,
whiche was in paradise, to haue perfecte righteousnesse with immortality: meaninge therby, that wheras man had in Paradise free liberty to purchase vnto hym self, a full and perfecte righteousnesse with immortality, ye same is now pearished and lofte, throughe hys disobedience and fall.
Secondlye, he sayth, that free wil is not so perished vnto sinners, but that they synne through it, specially al those that sinne with pleasure, whereby he doth vnderstand, that for to doe frely and frankly the thynge that is good, we haue nead of the grace of God, and that the same manne which hath not the holy goste, and which is not truelye regenerated, doth frely, and wythout compulsion serue vnto sinne, in so muche that he seemeth not to be the seruaunt of sinne, because that the euel that he doth, he dothe it voluntarily, freelye and francklye.
speaketh nothinge of suche a free wyll, as your faithful guides do most shamefully goe aboute to maintaine and vphold.
And therefore in an other place, he wryteth on this manner: whye dare miserable and wretched men be proud,
or boaste theym selues either of fre wyll, afore that they be deliuered, or of theyr owne strengthe, if they be already deliuered? And doe not marcke that in the verye name of free will, libertye or fredome is signifyed.
But where the spiryte of the LORDE is, there is freedome and libertye: Therefore, if they be seruauntes of sinne: whye do they boaste theym selues of free wyll? For, of whome so euer anye manne is ouercome, to hym is hee delyuered to bee hys bounde manne.
And if they be delyuered, whye doe they boaste theym selues as of theyr owne woorke? Are they so
free, that they refuse to be the seruauntes of him: that saythe:
withoute me ye canne doe nothynge? And in his booke, whyche he dyd wryte of grace and free wyl, these be hys woordes: Oure wyll is alwayes free,
For, eyther it is free from righteousnesse, when it serueth vnto synne, and then it is euyl, or it is free from synne, when it serueth vnto righteousnesse, and then it is good.
Whyche sentence he doth both repeate, and also expound in hys other woorkes, sayinge playnely,
that manne is made free from ryghteousnesse, by hys owne free wyll, but that he canne not bee made free from synne, sauyng onlye by the grace of oure Sauyoure.
Is not thys, praye you, to deryde and laughe to scorne, the vayne Tytle and name of Free wil? DYDIMVS.
Yet, in the sayinge that haue aledged, [Obiectio~ he dothe affyrme, and say, that God dothe requyre the workes of our free wyll, whych can not be vnderstanded of synne.
Whereby maye conclude, that oure wyll is free to doe good woorkes, els God woulde not requyre the workes of our fre wyll.
When haue rehearsed vnto you the hole sentence, [Aun&swer as it lyeth wrytten in S. Augustin, then iudge ye your self, whether they do not followe the steppes of theyr greate graundfather the deuell, in peruerting both the scryptures, and also the auncyent fathers.
And that ye maye be the surer of it, ye shall haue it fyrst in Latin, and then afterwardes in Englyshe.
The Latin is this: Nemo sit remissus et segnis ad sermendum deo, nec sic de gratia confidat, tanque deus liberi arbitrit ei{us}, quod per morte~ filii sui reparauit,
et sibi preparauit, opera non requirat, imo declinet a malo et fa ciat bonum.
That is to say: Lette no man be slacke and slouthfull to serue God, nor truste so vppon grace, as though God shoulde not requyre the woorckes of that free wyll, whych he hath both restored and prepared vnto hym self by the death of his sonne.
Yea rather: let hym flye from euyll and do good.
Any child may easely perceiue and vnderstand of what fre wil Saint Augustine doth speake there: euen of that same free will whiche God hath alreadye restored agayne and prepared vnto him self, by ye death of hys sonne Iesu Christ, who onlye is able to deliuer vs from the seruitude and bondage of synne, and by his holye spirit to make vs to do frely those woorkes, whyche GOD hathe prepared for vs, to walcke in.
Therefore in an other place, he saith plainlye these wordes.
faythfully on these and other lyke thinges, let vs not consent or agree vnto them,
which extollinge free wyll vnto pride, do rather go aboute, to cast it downe than to set it vp.
But let vs consyder with all humilitye and lowlynesse the sayinge of the Apostell, where he sayeth: It is God that worketh in vs both to wyl and also to worke: and so geue thankes vnto oure Lorde and sauioure, whych withoute any merytes goynge before, dyd heale vs beynge wounded, and dyd reconsyle vs beynge enemyes, dyd delyuer vs from captyuitye, dyd bryng vs from darkenesse vnto lyghte, and from death dyd call vs vnto life againe:
And confessyng humbly our infirmitye and weakenesse, let vs call vpon his mercy, that syth he hath preuented vs (accordinge to the Psalmistes saying) with his grace he vouchaf not only to kepe in vs, but also to augmente and encrease
his gyftes or rather his benefites, whiche he dyd vouchaf to geue vs. These words ar so plain, that any childe is able to vnderstand them.
They did yet aledge an other place oute of his treatise, vpon the first epistel of Iohn.
The wordes are these: And euery man that hath this hope in him, pourgeth him selfe, euen as he is pure.
Se how he hath not take~ away fre wyll, in so much that he did say: he purgeth him selfe.
The same fraude and deceate shal ye fynde in the aleaging of this place, that ye haue founde alredy in ye aboue reherced autoryties.
For, it foloweth immediatly after who doth purge vs but god? But God dothe not pourge thee agaynste thy wyll.
Therefore because that thou doste ioygne thy good wyll vnto god, thou purgest thy selfe.
Thou purgest thy selfe, not of thy selfe, but of hym that cometh to dwell in thee.
yet because that thou doste there somewhat willinglye, therfore is some thinge attributed vnto thee: that thou maist saye, as it is wrytten in the xxvi.
If thou sayest: thou arte my healper, thou dost somwhat, for if thou dost nothing, how dothe he helpe thee.
Fyrst, and foremost we may easely perceiue by the texte that he goeth vpon,
that he dothe speake of hym that is already renewed in Christ: els how coulde he haue anye hope of life euerlastinge? And for thys cause he sayth by and by: who doth purge vs but God? But it is not vnknowen vnto you, that GOD doth only pourge vs through faith in our sauiour Iesu Christ, which faith, is the mother of hope.
Therfore, er we can haue this hoope of lyfe euerlastinge, whiche the blessed Euangelist Saint Ihon dothe speake of there, we muste be purged throughe faythe.
then, that ther he speaketh of him, that is already made a newe creature in Christe, by whose spirite, which commeth to dwel in vs, we are purged and made cleane, and not of our selues.
What meaneth he then, when he saythe: [Que&stion that GOD purgeth no manne agaynste hys wyll? where vppon he dothe conclude, that we do pourge oure selues, because that we ioygne oure good will vnto God.
And a lyttle after it followeth: if thou sayste, thou art my helper, then thou dost somewhat: For, if thou doste nothing howe canne he healpe thee? Here do we learne, as far as can gather by his wordes.
Firste, that we must bryng our good wyll vnto God: for, he wil saue no man against his will.
Secondly, that except we do somewhat, we can not say truelye, that God is oure helper.
wel marcked of you, brother Albion, thought self to haue made the same obiection, excepte ye had preuented me.
[Aun&swer do not deny but that we muste brynge oure good will vnto God.
But of whom haue we this good wil? haue we it of oure selues, thincke ye? Heare what S. Paule saythe: It is God, that worketh in you,
both the wil, and also the dede, euen of his own good will.
Where (as Saint Austine doth wryte) he doth sufficiently declare,
that it is God that worketh in vs, the good wil.
For, if we should aske, whether the good wil be a gyfte of GOD or not, it is maruayle if any man dareth say naye.
Where vnto Fulgentius dothe agree, sayinge: Euerye good work then, whyche we doe woorke in god, the same dothe god woorke in vs.
Both oure good wyll then, and also oure good workes be of hym.
Whyche thynge, the doctour of the gentyles dothe affyrm with these wordes.
It is God that woorketh in vs, bothe the wyll and the deede, euen of hys good wyll and pleasure.
Ye see then of whome we haue thys good wil, that we must brynge vnto God, euen of hym selfe and not of vs.
For, it is he and none other that dothe worke it in vs, by hys holye spirit.
And therefore, where he sayeth: that GOD saueth or purgeth no manne agaynste hys wil, the same is mooste true:
but as Gregorye wryteth, he dothe preuente vs, wyth his grace that we maye be willinge, and with his healpynge hand he dothe followe vs, least we shuld will in vaine.
the churche prayeth sayinge: Et nostras rebelles ad te compelle voluntates.
That is to say: And compell or dryue oure rebellious wyls vnto thee.
Beholde (sayeth he) excepte oure rebellious wyll be dryuen vnto God, it is not healed.
So saith our sauiour: No man is able to come vnto me, excepte my father doth drawe him.
We are drawen against our wils, but we are lead willinglye or with our wils.
that of vnwillinge persons, we must, by the inwarde drawing of our heauenly father, be made wylling: els oure wils ca~not be healed fro~ their natural rebelliousnesse, which we haue of oure fyrste parents Adam and Eue.
Thus then we maye righte well say, that God saueth no man against his wyll: For, why? He maketh them all wyllinge afore, whome he dothe saue.
And whom he made wyllinge, them dothe he also healpe, aide, and adsist, that
they maye doo the thinge, that he hathe made them wyllinge to do.
And so maye we affyrme boldely, that God is oure healper. because that beinge throughlye regenerated or renewed in Christe, we do through the assistaunce and helpe of his holy spirit, worke with his grace.
what truth and faithfulnesse, youre spirituall gentyll men do vse, in aleadginge the olde writers of the auncient Catholyke churche.
And that all that they go aboute, is by hooke and by crooke, to bringe men, from the true and right vnderstandinge of of Goddes worde: and to plucke them from the trust, that they oughte to haue in the meare mercye and goodnesse of God, and in his gratuite and free grace, in to a vayne confidence of their own natural vertu stre~gth.
woulde wyshe, that at the least they woulde alwayes haue before
theyr eies, this goodly sayinge of Eucherius bishop of Lions: Christ saith he, is the tre of life, who so euer doth retch forth his hand vnto him, shal liue: but free will, is the tre of knowledge of good and euil: whosoeuer forsaking the grace of God, wyll taste of it, shall dye the death.
Nowe knowe, Lorde, that it is not in mannes power, to order hys own wayes, or to rule hys owne steppes and goinges? PHILA.
For, your communication was of heauenlye and spyrituall thinges, that is to saye, of the knowledge of God, and of his blessed will, and whether we can rule oure selues accordynge vnto it.
Whiche to doe, it lyeth not in the power or fre wil of man.
Ieremye dothe speake of earthlye thinges, and which do pertain vnto this present life.
In deede, God hath yet left in man a certaine natural light, wherby he may know what is good for this presente lyfe of the bodye and for the gouernement of his house,
but yet nothing can be bring to passe, wythout the ayde and healpe of God.
So muste the saying of the wyse manne be vnderstanded, where he saythe: man deuiseth in hys hart, but the Lord ordreth hys goynges.
Wher vnto the common Prouerbe dothe agre, that is to say: Man doth purpose, but God dothe dispose.
How be it, woulde fayne knowe, what aunswere, they made vnto you.
They dyd aunswere me, that in deede manne was not able manye tymes to bringe that thynge to passe, that he woulde withoute the grace of God: that it lyeth not in the power of man
to walke vprightly in the waye of righteousnesse without thassista~ce and healpe of the holy ghoste.
And for the probation of it, they dyd bryng in certayne places, whiche ye haue aleadged alreadi, as these: man can receaue nothing at all,
we are not able of our selues to thinke a good thought, but all our ablenesse commeth of God.
where he sayeth: Euery good gift and euery perfect gifte is from aboue, and cometh downe from the father of light.
chaunced once to reason with a great doctor of diuinity who did affirme, that it dyd lye in our power to receyue the grace of God when it is offred vnto vs, making a great bragge, that he was able to proue it by manifest textes of the scripture.
Then dyd aske the gentle manne whether it was not a good gift to receiue the grace
of God, when it is offred? whyche thinge he did graunte by and by.
Then did make mine argument after this manner: Euerye good gift is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of lyghte.
But to receiue the grace of GOD when it is offred, is a good gyfte, ergo it commeth of God, that we do receyue hys grace, and not of our selues.
What answer he made me? warrante you, a doctor lyke aunswer.
For, by and by he tooke hys gloues from vnder his girdle, and did cast them vnto me, saying: Loe, geue you these gloues, bee they not yours, when haue geue~ you them? can it be said, that they be mine stil? PHILA.
But go on stil brother Albion, praye you dyd they aleadge any more? ALBION.
For, they dyd aleadge Gregory, who wrytinge vpon these woordes of the Psalmist:
My soule thyrsteth for thee in a barren and dry lande, where no water is: saith plainly these wordes: Sith that fre wyll hathe bene corrupted in our fyrste father, we are not able to wyl a good thyng, excepte we be healped wyth the grace of God.
knew ryghte well, that youre faythfull guydes, shoulde be fayn at length to crye peccaui, and to recante their dyuelyshe and erroneous opinyon.
For, if ye marcke well the definition, that they gaue vnto free wyll: ye shall fynde, that they dyd attrybute nothynge at all vnto the grace of God, yea no mention at all, was made of it.
Ye se nowe that they saye agaynst theyr own selues: wherein, they doe shewe
They hadde spoken so largelye wythoute the boke, that they wer fayne to goe backe, and to vnsaye agayne that whych they had sayde afore.
But vppon this texte of Ieremy myghte make myne argumente after thys manner: If man canne not wythoute the healpe of God,
brynge earthlye thynges to passe: howe muche lesse shall he be able wythoute the grace of God, to come to the knowledge of heauenly thinges? EVTRAPE.
Herein may we see the beastishnesse of these bragging marchauntes of the cleargy.
For, they do assone aleadge that, whyche maketh agaynste theym, as that whyche seemeth to make for theym.
For, if all thinges be well consydered and marcked, the laste authorities of the scripture, which they dyd aledge wyth the sayinge of Gregory, doe make for vs all together.
Howe be it, they alwayes harped vpon this stringe, that manne hath free wil, and that such sentences and sayinges do not take awai fre wil from vs. PHILA.
know well ynoughe, that such sayinges can not take away free wil from vs.
And howe coulde that thynge be, taken awaye from vs, that we haue not? How so euer the matter goeth, suche sentences do plainly declare, that man hath not such fre wil, as they do mooste lyingly affyrme.
Therefore, asked them, whye oure sauioure Iesus Christ did saye: No man commeth vnto me,
For, it appeareth by theese wordes, that man hathe no fre wyl at al to do wel. PHILA.
The Manicheans did go aboute to proue by this place, that we are able to do nothinge of oure owne selues: But they do not vnderstande it well.
For, by this sayinge free wyll is not abolyshed and put downe, but it is shewed and declared, that it hath alwayes neede of the healpe of God, and that God draweth no man against his wyll, but such, as do, to the vttermost of their power endeuour them selues to come vnto him.
that God compelleth no manne to come vnto him against his wyll: but that he doth drawe them, that be wyllinge or that retche theyr handes vnto hym, for to be drawen of him.
For, do graunt that God shall neuer saue them, that be obstinate in their wyckednesse,
or that do obstinately perseuer and continue in their vnbelief.
To be shorte, do confesse, that God wyll saue no man, excepte he doth consente and agree first, and haue a wyll to be saued.
But in this doth lye all the matter, whether we haue thys wyll of oure selues or not.
But we haue alredye sufficientlye proued bothe by the scriptures, and also by many autorities of the auncient fathers, that it is God onely that worketh in vs bothe the wyll,
We must then vnderstand, that God saueth no man that is vnwyllinge to be saued, or that doth withstand and resist alwaies his blessed wyll and pleasure: but afore that he saueth any man, he maketh that same manne by his grace, to consente and agree vnto his blessed wyll and pleasure: yea, he doth reatch fourth his hand vnto him, for so plucke him vp. ALBION.
They did saye vnto me in dede, that by the same drawinge,
we must vnderstande the grace of God whiche dothe preuent vs: or his inwarde admonytion and callinge, wherby we are moued to do good, and to be obediente vnto the lawe and co~maundementes of God.
knewe righte well that they shoulde be fayne at length maugry their smothe shaue~ faces to attribute al vnto the grace of God, wherby he doth moue, styr vp, and wake out of slepe the wil of man, geuinge it strength to rise vp, and to come vnto him, whereby also he dothe reuele and open vnto him, the miserye and wretchednesse, that he was in, and whyche was hydden from hym, and whereby he dothe strengthen hym to walke in hys lawes and commaundementes, and to doe the thynge that is acceptable before hym.
did also, as occasion gaue me, aleadge vnto them this sayinge of Paule: knowe that in me (that is to saye,
To wyl is presente wyth me but to perfourme that, which is good, find not.
For, the good that wyll, do not, but the euyll, whiche wyll not that do I. PHI.
who expounding this place, doth say that by these wordes the Apostell doth not take awaye free wyll, nor yet bring in any necessity or conpulsion.
For els in stede that he did say, nolo, wil not, he shuld haue sayed cogor, am constreygned.
If the exposition of Chrisostome wer true, then must we confesse, that.
S. Paul did voluntarely of his free wyl ye thing that was
euil, and that he did willinglye, of a sette minde forsake the good that he mighte haue done.
But to say so, were to blaspheme, not onlye the Apostle, but also the holye ghost, that was in hym.
For, who would say, that after Saint Paule was once conuerted and renewed in Christ, he did sinne voluntarelye, or that he did for the nonce, and of a set mind, forsake the good thyng, that he myghte haue done? aske you: if ye shoulde doe that thyng, which ye wold not do, wer it not by compulsion, that ye shuld do it.
that thys is a glosse of Orleans, whiche destroyeth the text.
For, Chrisostome maketh there no dyfference, betwyxt the carnal manne, and the manne that is renewed in Christe.
Where as Saynte Paule dothe speake there of the manne that is
regenerated or borne of new, whiche thing he doth vnder hys owne person, that we might be the surer that it is so.
For, ye shal vndersta~d that as the carnal and fleshly men do geue them selues frely to be the bounde seruauntes of synne, so in them that be renewed in Christe,
and made newe creatures by hys holy spirit, there is alwayes a continuall batayle betwixt the spirite and the fleshe, so that the euil that they do, they do it, being ouercom by the flesh, which dothe alwayes lust against the spirite: And if they leaue anye good thinge vndone, whych they wolde do, it is because that the rebelliousnes of the fleshe wyll not let them, nor yet suffer them to do it.
to what purpose, Sainte Paule dyd speake that, wayghinge the wordes that go before, and the wordes that come after, shoulde fynde,
that Saint Paul doth speke there of the sensuality of man, which is alwaies repugnant vnto reason, because of oure corrupted nature, and not of fre wyl.
For, he saythe by and by after: It is not that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me.
Althoughe this be the distinccion of a Philosopher, going about to defend mans strength, and to proue that reason is perfect in hym, meane, in ma~, yet if ye wil marke diligentlye the woordes and sayinges of youre faythfull guydes, ye shal find that there was a certayne repugnance in Saynt Paule.
It followeth then, that there was in hym no suche Free wyll, as they doe boaste of.
For, it was not the wyll of Saynte Paule, that dyd the same euyll, but hys sensuality.
Therefore, the wyll oughte to haue resysted this sensualitye, if it be so stronge, that it is able to doe
what soeuer it wil. Neuerthelesse S. Paule, afore he spake thus, had sayd: we know that the law is spirituall, but am carnall, sold vnder synne.
Ego, I. Whereby he dothe vnderstand all that was in hym of hys corrupted nature, as is both mans reason and wyll: he saythe not my sensuality is sold vnder sin, but he saith: am carnal sold vnder sin.
And afterwardes he called all hys corrupted nature, synne, sayinge: It is not that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me: vnderstanding by sinne, the natural corruption that was in him.
The holye scrypture doth put no difference betwixt sensuality and reason,
makinge reaso~ more perfect than the sensuality is in heauenlye thinges, or in thynges that pertayne to saluation.
For, man hym self beynge not yet renewed, is altogether fleshly and carnall, he is nothinge els, saye, but sensuality.
Albion, beware of such doctours, as your bragging faithfull guides be, whiche haue lieuer to followe heathenish philosophers, than the spirit of God.
For, such doctoures do all that they can to caste manne headlong into hell, being like vnto the serpent, whyche sayde vnto Eue: ye shall be as God,
For, to sette man vppon his fre wyl, is to sette man vppon a reede, and vpon vanishing smoke.
What if should reson thus with you? [Obiectio~ Eyther synne is of necessity, or it lieth in the wil and power of man: If it be of necessity: that is to saye, if a man by necessitye is dryuen to it, whye should he be punished for it.
Again if it lieth in the wyl and power of man, then can it be shonned and auoyded, that is to say, a man maye chuse, whether he will sin or not.
Where vpon may conclude that eyther God is vnrighteous in punishing
menne for the thynge, that they be dryuen vnto dy necessitye, or that we haue free wyll to do what we list.
Which thynge semeth to be moste true, by the wordes, that God dothe speake vnto Cain,
saying: if thou dost euyl, thy synne lyeth open in the doore.
Let it be subdued vnto thee, and rule thou it.
[Aun&swer Thys obiection, were the Pelagians wont to make against Sainte Augustyne.
Howe be it, wyll not burden them wyth such abhomynable heresyes, til we haue fully discussed the hole matter.
Fyrste and foremost saye, that synne oughte neuerthelesse to bee imputed, thoughe it be of necessytye.
For, if anye manne woulde dyspute wyth GOD, or woulde vnder thys pretence escape hys iudgement, because that he coulde do none otherwyse, he hathe thys answer ready.
For, whence commeth this vnablenesse or necessitye, that manne goeth about to excuse hym selfe by, but of the corruption of hys nature? And whence commeth thys corruptyon, but that manne dyd rebell againste God hys creatour? If all men be giltye of thys disobedience and rebellyon, lette them not thyncke, that they shalbe excused by necessity, wherein they haue a most euident cause of theyr damnation.
whe~ he saythe: do boldlye affyrme, that free wyl was in that manne, that was created fyrst, for he was so made, that nothing could wythstand his wil, if he wold haue kept the commaundements.
But after that he hath synned throughe hys fre wyll, he dyd cast vs all that be come of hys stocke into necessitye.
This necessity then, that we be in, commeth of the disobedience and rebellion of our fyrst pare~t Adam.
Therfore no vnrighteousnesse can be imputed vnto God, thoughe he punisheth vs for those synnes that we be dryuen vnto by the same necessitye, that we haue of the originall corruption of oure owne nature.
Secondlye where they saye, that if sinne lieth in the wyll of man, it may be shonned and auoyded,
We may chuse whether we sin or not, that same were moste true, if man were master of hys own wyl.
But we haue alreadye proued, that the wyll of man, afore he be renued in Christ, and restored againe by his holye spirit, ss in the thraldome and bondage of sinne, and can in no wyse be deliuered from it, till the sonne of God hath made it fre by his holye spirite.
while it is free from righteousnesse, and seruaunt vnto syn,
it can do no more but sinne stil, accordinge to his corrupted nature.
whiche were rehearsed euen now, what strife and battail there is in the wyll of manne, being already renewed in Christ, so that many times he cannot do the good thing that he would, and the euel that he woulde not, the same is he fayne to do, so violente is the remnaunte of sinne, that contynueth in manne alwayes vnto hys lyues end.
But what say ye to the place, [Obiectio~ which was aledged oute of Genesis, where the Lord saithe these wordes vnto Caine: if thou doste euill,
Lette it be subdued vnto thee, and rule thou it? do not these wordes declare plainly that sinne lieth in the power of manne, and that he maye rule it, as it pleaseth hym? PHI.
this place hath bene euyll translated out of the Hebrewe.
For, wher they should haue sayed interrogatiuely, and in the masculine gender: Shall he then be subdued vnto thee, and wilt thou rule him? They did put awaye the interrogatiue poynt, did setfourth the se~te~ce wt tharticle of neuter ge~der as though it ought to be referred vnto synne whereof he spake before.
that both Abell and Cain had offred sacrifices vnto the LORDE, Cain of the fruyte of the earthe, and Abell of the fyrstlynges of hys shepe and of the fatte of them, and that the Lord had a respect vnto Abell his offring, but not vnto Cain nor yet to his sacryfice.
Wherfore he was exceadinge wrothe, so that his countenance chaunged.
why Abell and his offring did please God, and why againe God had no pleasure in Cain nor yet in his offringe.
Forsoth because that Abell did offer wyth faythe, and the other wythoute faythe.
For, wythoute faythe it is vnpossyble to please God? what soeuer is not of faythe, is synne.
Therefore, Caine had more iuste occasyon to be angrye wyth hym selfe, and wyth hys vnbelief, than wyth hys brother Abell, who was both innocent, and dyd walcke vprightlye before God, doing al that he dyd wyth a synceare and pure fayth.
That therfore Cain might the better perceyue hys own saut the LORDE doothe playnlye declare vnto hym, that all that he dyd, was synne.
Elsse if he had done well shoulde not he haue ben as well regarded, as hys brother Abell.
But his vnfaithfulnesse, that dyd lie in his hearte, did witnesse that he did not walke vprightly before god.
Which thing he vnderstode, when he saide: if thou doste euyll, doth not thy sinne lie open in the dore? That is to saye: if thou doste the thing that thou dost vnfaithfullye, dothe not thy conscience beare record of the same, and is alwaies readye to condempne thee? What cause haste thou then to be angrye with thy brother,
because that he doth walke vprightly before me, and with a pure and sincere faith: shal he be subiect vnto thee in such thinges, or shall he be ruled by the in thinges that pertaine to the true worshippynge of me?
Some do reade it withoute an interrogatife poynt on this wise: he shall be subiecte vnto thee, and thou shalt rule him.
Wherby they do vnderstande, that when Caine did see that his brother Abell was
in such fauour with God, he was affrayed least he shoulde lose the righte of the first borne, and that Abell should be his Lord and master.
And for this cause he did conceiue a deadly hatred against him, seekinge all maner of meanes to rydde him oute of the waye.
The Lord therfore, for to put him out of that foolyshe feare, that he was in, did certifye him, that notwithstandinge the fauoure that he dyd beare vnto Abel, he shuld not lose one iote of his dignity and honour but that Abell shoulde accordinge to the ryght and order of his byrth be subiecte and obedient vnto hym styll.
Whose words but for tediousnesse wold haue here aleadged, as they doe lye in his exposition vpon the first booke of Moses.
If both vertu and vice do not come of the free election of [Obiectio~
the minde: Whye shoulde man be punished for vice, or rewarded for vertue? PHILALETHES.
This argumente did the Pelagians vse also, as Sainte Ierome dothe write rehercinge their very wordes which are these: Quod si gratia dei in nobis agit, illa ergo, non nos qui non laboramus coronabitur.
That is to say: If the grace of God dothe worke in vs, therefore it shall be crowned, and not we that laboure not.
As touchinge punishementes, saye, that we do deseruingly suffer the~,
For, what dothe it skyll whether we synne throughe free wil or other wyse, syth that of our owne nature we be synne altogether, yea and the bounde slaues of fynne? doth not Sainte Paul saye that of oure owne nature we are the chyldren of wrathe?
If we be the children of wrathe, what are we elles but chyldren of damnation,
and fyre brondes of hell? And as touching the rewards of righteousnesse, what absurditye were it to saie that they come of the free mercye of God,
rather than of our owne merytes and deseruinges? Doth not Saint Paule saye, that lyfe euerlastynge is the gyfte of God? How could lyfe euerlasting, whyche is the most sure rewarde of good woorkes, be the gyfte of God, excepte it were freelye geuen? But yf they woulde heare of what begynninge the holye Apostell dothe fetche the glorye of the Saints, they shoulde easely espye out their own errour: Whom (sayeth he) he hathe chosen,
them did he call, whome he hath called, them did he iustifye, and whom he hathe iustifyed them dyd hee gloryfye.
Wherefore then, by the sayinge of the Apostell are the faythfull crowned wyth eternall and euerlastynge glorye?
because forsouth that by the free mercye of God, and not by their owne industrye, they be both chosen, called and iustifyed.
Whye should any man fear then, yt ther shoulde be no more merites if free wyll were ouerthrowen? Or why shoulde any manne flye from that thinge, that the srcipture doth call vs to? What haste thou (sayeth saint Paule) that thou hast not receyued?
And if thou hast receaued, why dost thou boast, as thoughe thou haddest not receiued? Ye see that he dothe therfore take awaye all thynges from free wyll, because that he wold leaue no place vnto merites.
But God as he is rych in doyng good vnto all men, so the gyftes that he geueth vnto vs, maketh them oure owne, and so rewardeth them as oure owne.
And therefore Sainte Augustine sayeth: Nihil es per te. Peccata tua sunt, merita autem dei. Supplicium tibi debetur: et cum premium venerit, sua coronabit non meritae tua: that is to saye: Thou arte nothing by thy selfe.
The sinnes are thyne owne, but the merites are of God.
Punishment is due vnto the and when the reward dothe come, he shall crowne his giftes,
And in an other place these be also his woordes: Si reddetur tibi quod debetur puniendus es. Quid ergo fit? Non tibi reddit deus penam, sed donat gratiam.
Si vis esse alienus a gratia merita tua. Whiche we maye English after this manner: if that be rendred or payed vnto thee, that is due, thou muste bee punyshed.
What is done then? God dothe not render or paye vnto thee the punishment that is due or deserued: but he geueth vnto thee, the grace that is neyther due nor deserued.
If thou wylte be putte from the grace, boste forthe thyne own merites.
But what nede I: to aledge any more sayings of his, syth that all his workes, be full of suche sentences? Whereby it dothe appeare, that he dothe adscribe nothinge at all vnto the merites of men, but all together vnto the free mercy and goodnesse of God.
And therfore the argument that ye did brynge, maye rather be called the argumente of an heathenish philosopher, than the argument of a Christian doctoure.
[Obiectio~ Thys was also one of theyr arguments, wherby they went about to proue that we haue free wyll.
Wherfore, say they, shoulde any exhortations be made vnto the people, or wherfore shoulde they be rebuked for their sinnes, if it lieth not in them to obey, or if it lyeth not in theyr power to shon vice and to embrace vertue? PHILALETHES.
wherfore he was compelled to make a boke de correptione et gratia, that is to say: of rebukynge and of grace.
Wher he doth stoutly confute all the obiections and argumentes that the aduersaryes can make,
which maye be reduced and brought to this short and compendious summe: man, knowe in the commaundeme~t, what thou art bound to do.
In the rebuking, learne that throughe thyne owne faut thou hast it not, and in praier learn whence thou must receiue ye thing yt thou wilt haue.
First, we are not alone in this cause, but Christ al his apostles.
Let them se how they can shift, hauing to do with such aduersaries.
Because ye Christ saith yt we can do nothinge without him,
dothe he lesse rebuke them therefore that withoute him did euil? or dyd he lesse exhorte all men to geue the~ selues vnto good woorkes? Howe sharpelye dothe
Saint Paule inueighe against the Corinthians for the neglecting of christian loue and charity? and yet at lengthe he desireth of God, that he vouchsafe to geue them christian loue and charity.
Wrytinge to the Romaines, he doth testify that it lieth not in the wyl and renning of man, but in the mercye of God: yet afterwardes he dothe not cease to admonishe,
Why doe they not therefore warne the Lord, or geue him counsel, that he do not lose his labour, requiring those thinges of menne which he alone is able to geue? Or rebuking them for those thinges, which only throughe the lacke of hys grace are committed? Why do they not warn Paul to spare them in whose power it lieth not to wil nor to renne, without the mercye of God, wherof they be al together destituted? As thoughe the Lord is not able to shewe a sufficient reason or cause of his doctrin, whiche
in dede doth offer it self vnto them that do godly and reuerently seke for it.
Verely S. Paule dothe well declare and shew how much,
both exhorting, and rebukinge are able by them selues to change the mindes of the hearers, when he wryteth, that neyther he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watreth, but that it is the Lord that geueth the encrease, which only worketh effectuously.
[Que&stion Wherfore then do the exhortations serue? [Aun&swer If they that be of an obstinate hearte doe contemne and despise them, they shall be for a witnesse vnto them, when they come before the iudgemente seat of Christe.
Yea nowe at thys present, they do already beate and smite theyr consciences: For, although they laugh them to scorn, yet they be not able to dysalowe them.
But what shoulde they doe? Sith that the softnesse of the hart, which is necessary vnto obedience is denied vnto theym? yea rather
what are they able to say, sith that they can impute the same hardnes of their own harts, but only to the~ selues? but the chief vtility is to be considered in the faithfull: For, as the Lord doth woorke in them, all thinges by his holy spirit, so dothe he not neglect ye instrument of his word, nor yet occupy it, wythoute efficacy or effect.
Let therefore the truth stand, that is to saye, let all menne be sure of this, that all the hole strengthe and vertue of the godlye dothe lye only in the grace of God.
Whye be they warned of theyr duetye, and not rather permitted all together vnto the guyding or gouernment of the spirit? Why are they stirred and moued with exhortations, sythe that they can make no more haste, than the spirite dothe pricke them forwardes: whye are they rebuked, if they go at any time out of the way: sith that they fall through the weakenesse of theyr fleshe? man what
If by exhortatyon he wyll haue vs to be prepared to receiue the same self grace, where by we are made obedient vnto his word: is there any thing that thou canst iustly reproue in this deuine policye of his? If exhortations and rebukings shuld serue for nothing els amonge the godlye, but for to rebuke synne, they oughte not to be co~pted vnprofitable.
sith that the spirite workynge inwardlye, they doe profyte muche for to kyndle in menne a desyre of goodnesse, to shake of slouggishnesse, to take awaye the pleasure of wyckednesse, and the poysonned sweetenesse of it: and contrarywise for to engender in them a hatred and tediousnesse of vyce, and of this wicked and synnefull world, who dareth saye that they be superflue or vnprofitable? EVTRAPELVS Here in deede S. Augustin doth answer throughly the vain obiections of the Pelagians, so that any reasonable man oughte to contente him selfe wyth his answer.
How be it, me thinke that they were sufficiently answered already in our firste communication, that we haue had this mornyng of the deuine predestinatyon of God.
Thys haue gathered out of the wordes of S. Augustin:
that God doth two manner of waies worke in hys elect and chosen: Inwardly wyth his holye spirit, and outwardly with his word with his spirite he maketh theym new creatures, lightenynge theyr mindes, and kindeling theyr hartes with the loue of righteousnes.
With his woorde, he dothe moue and styrre them to desire the same renewing, to seke for it, and to embrace it.
And to both of them doth he retch forth his hand effectuously,
And when he doth send his word vnto the reprobate, thoughe it be not for theyr amendment, yet it is to thys ende, that they may in this preset world be confounded with the testimony and witnesse of theyr owne conscience, and also be made vnexcusable agaynst the day of iudgement.
But what can ye say to these places of the scripture, [Obiectio~ that they did a leadge vnto me: wyl willinglye offer sacrifice vnto thee.
Agayne: wyll of my free wyll praise and laude thee.
Item: Let thyne hande be readye to saue me: For, haue chosen thy commaundements? Do not these wordes of the prophette Dauid declare plainlye, that the thing, that he did, he did it willingly, frely and frankly? PHILA.
saye, [Aun&swer that they make or put no difference betwyxte the man that is alreadye renewed by the spirite of God, and the manne
For, the man that is not regenerated or borne of newe, wyll speake no such woordes as Dauid dyd.
For, they are the wordes of a manne, that is alreadye made a newe creature by the Spirite of God.
This will then that was in Dauid did not come of hys owne self nor of his fre will that he had of his owne nature: but it did com of the spirit of God, who dyd geue this will vnto Dauid.
For, Iesus Christ him selfe doth say: Verely, verelye saye vnto you:
excepte a manne be borne from aboue, he can not see the kingdome of God.
Where by he dothe meane, that manne is able to doe nothynge that is pleasaunte or acceptable vnto GOD.
Nor yet taste the swetenesse of the heauenly kingdome, excepte it be geuen vnto him.
If (said thei vnto me) we haue no free wil, [Obiectio~ why shoulde
God so manye times call synners vnto repentaunce? were it not labour lost so to do? How manye tymes doth he by his Prophets crye out and say: Turne ye vnto me, al ye endes of the earthe,
and so shall ye be saued? Againe: Tourne vnto me and repent.
If menne haue not fre wil to do these thinges the prophets do labor in vaine.
If ye marke wel the talke and communication of youre faithfull guides, [aun&swer ye shall easelye perceiue, that they be not throughlye exercised in the scryptures.
For, God doth not so speake vnto menne by hys Prophettes, because that synners are able of theyr own selues to turn vnto hi~. DIDyMVS.
in the persons of the Lorde: Tourne ye vnto me, and ye shall be healed: by and by Ieremye dothe crye oute and saye:
Yea, assone, as thou turnest me, shal reforme my self.
Again: the Lorde dothe commaunde, that we shoulde circumcise oure owne heartes:
yet by Moses he dothe declare, that the same circumcision is made with his owne hande.
He doth also require the renewing of our heartes: but in an other place, he doth plainly testify, that it is he him self that geueth it.
Loke therfore, what God doth promise, that do we not by oure free will or nature (as S. Augustine saithe) but GOD dothe it, by his grace.
that he dothe bid vs to marke amonge the rules of Tironius, that is to say, that we shoulde note diligentlye the dyfference that is betwixt the law and the promises or betwixte the commaundementes and the grace.
do exhorte the faythfull to abyde and perseuer in the grace of God.
But Paule in an other place doth shewe, whence, that vertue of constancye and perseueraunce dothe come:
fynally my bretherne (saith he) be strong in the Lorde.
Again: for this cause do bowe my knees vnto the father of oure Lord Iesu Christe, that he woulde graunte you accordinge to the rychesse of his glory, that ye maye be strengthed wyth might, by the spirit of ye inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hartes by faith.
Moreouer he sayeth: Greue not the holye spyrit of God,
But the thynge that he doth requyre there, because that it canne not be perfourmed by menne, he doth desyre God to graunte it vnto the Thessalonians, sayinge:
wherfore, we pray alwayes for you, that your god make you worthy of your callinge, and fulfyll al
good purpose of his goodnesse and the worke of fayth wyth power, that the name of oure Lorde Iesu Christ, maye be glorifyed in you, and ye in hym throughe the grace of our God, and of the Lord Iesu Christ.
These places do sufficiently declare, that what so euer God dothe requyre of vs, the same he must worke in vs by his holye spirite.
For, of our selues we are able to do no maner of thing, ye good is? DIDY.
[Que&stion Why doth God the~ speake after this maner vnto men? PHI.
[Aun&swer God causeth men to be thus admonished and warned, because that it is a meane, that he hathe appoynted and ordayned.
And whiche he dothe vse, for to illuminate and lighten those that be elected and chose vnto life euerlasting and for to make the~ to know their sinnes.
For, god by the preaching of his worde, by the vertue of his holy spirite, doth geue vnto them that be chose~ vnto lyfe euerlasting
And although this doctrin of conuersyon or turning is directed vnto all me~ generally, yet doth it most chieflye pertain vnto the elect and chosen, vnto whom by this meane, God illuminating them, doth geue power and strength to conuert or turn.
God causeth obstynate synners to be thus warned by his Prophets, because that they shuld not pretend ignorance, nor excuse them selues by it in the iudgeme~t of God.
And also for to shewe yt he loueth vertue, rightousnesse, and that he is not author of euil.
Yet we must not say that God did send him in vain.
Thus they said vnto me: [Obiectio~ wherfore do these promises serue: seke after the thing yt is good, and not euill, so shall ye liue:
yea the lord god of hostes shalbe with you accordinge to your owne desires.
Againe: If ye be louinge and obedient, ye shal enioye the best thing that groweth in the lande: but if ye be obstinate and rebellious, ye shal be deuoured with the swerde.
Item: if thou wylt put away thy abhominations oute of my sight thou shalt not be dryuen oute.
If thou shalt harken vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God, to obserue and do all his commaundements,
which commaund the this daye, then shall the Lord thy God set the aboue all nations vpon earth.
And such other lyke: excepte we haue free wyll, or except it lyeth in oure power to fulfyll and perfourme the condytions, that are annexed vnto them? we maye saye in deede that they be goodlye promyses, if the conditions, that be annexed vnto them, canne not be perfourmed by oure owne strengthe and power: and that God dothe playe mocke holy
daye wyth vs, if he promysethe thynges, that it lyeth not in vs to obtayne.
And saye that it is a playne blasphemye, [Aun&swer to affyrme that God doth playe mocke holy daye wyth vs, when he doth prouoke vs to deserue his benefits although he knoweth vs to be vnable to do it.
For, when the promises are offered vnto the faythfull vngodly in lyke,
For, as God dothe by his commaundementes pricke the consciences of the vngodly, lest putting away altogether the reme~braunce of his iudgementes, they shoulde haue to much pleasure in synne: so by his promises he doth testify and declare vnto them, how vnworthy they are of his liberality, goodnesse.
For, who woulde saye that it is not mete and conueniente,
that the Lorde shoulde do good vnto them, that do worship him?
And that againe, he shoulde accordinge to his seueritye and iustyce, take vengaunce of theym that are despisers of his maiesty? Therfore it ca~ not be said, but that God doth iustlye, when in his promises, he dothe prescribe and geue suche a law and condition vnto the vngodlye, whiche be wrapped in sinne, that they shall receiue and enioye hys benefites, if they doe forsake their wickednesse, althoughe hee shoulde do it onlye for thys cause, that they maye vnderstande that they are iustlye and deseruinglye put from those thinges, yt are due vnto ye true worshippers of God.
Again: sith that God, dothe by all meanes prouoke the faithful to cal for his grace, why shuld not he as wel attempte the same by his promisses, as by his law and ce~maundements? being taught the wyl of God by his commaundements, we are warned of our owne miserye, because that of oure own nature,
we do all together dissent and disagre from it: and also we are moued to cal vppon the spirit of god, for to bring vs into the right way.
that it can not be put awaye nor shaken of, by the lawe and commaundements of god: promisses are added, that so by some swetenesse we might be prouoked and allured to the loue of heauenly things.
Now, the more desirous that we are of the true ryghteousnes, the more feruent are we to cal for the grace of God.
These thinges beynge well considered, who would say, that suche promises be vnprofitable, though we be not able to fulfil the conditio~s, that are annered vnto them? EVTRAPELVS.
that hathe anye cromme of godlye vnderstandinge in hys bellye.
For, by them the reprobate vngodlye do learne how vnworthy they are of the bounteous liberality
when they see in the conditions, that be annexed vnto them, their owne misery, weakenesse, infirmitye and vnablenesse, are stirred and moued by the same to cal more earnestly, for the grace of God, and for the assistaunce and help of his holy spirit.
[Obiectio~ The Lord doth laye to the Israelites charge, that it was only longe of them, that they did not receiue all kinde of liberality and goodnesse at hys hande.
As when the Prophet sayth: Amaleck and the Cananites are before you,
with whose swordes ye shall be destroyed, because ye wolde not obey the Lord.
Because haue called you, and ye haue not aunswered nor obeyed: therfore, will do vnto this house, as haue don vn to Silo.
Again: This people hath not harkened vnto the voyce of the Lord theyr God, nor receaued hys doctrine: Therfore, the Lord hath
woulde not be obedient vnto the Lorde: All these plages haue happened vnto you.
Howe coulde the Israelites be cast in the tethe with such thinges, except it had lyen in them to shonne and auoyde those thinges, that be there laied to their charge? For they might haue aunswered by and by: We had a mind to prosperity,
and did fear trouble and aduersity: but that we did not obey the Lorde, nor harcken vnto his voyce, that we might obtayne the one, and eschue the other, it was because that we are vnder ye bondage of synne, and can not doe frely the thinges, that we would.
Those thinges then are not iustly laid to oure charge whiche it lyeth not in our power for to shonne or auoid.
As for the pretence of necessity, [Aun&swer wherby sinners go about to excuse the~ selues,
it hath ben al ready declared, what pore healpe can be had in it, sythe that the cause Originall, and of spring of it, is in our owne selues, by oure naturall corruption, that we haue of our first parent Adam.
Therfore, do aske whether they can proue them selues to be wythout faut or not? For, if there be any faut in them: it is not wythout a cause, that God did caste them in the teethe, that it was throughe their owne wickednesse, that they did not feele the frute of his goodnesse and mercy.
Can they say nay but that theyr wicked and corrupted will is the cause of their rebellyous contumacye and stubburnenesse? If they fynde that the fountayne and well sprynge of theyr owne euyl and miserye is wythin them selues: what do they trauail to finde out outwarde causes, and all because that they wil not seme to be the authoures of theyr owne destruction? If it be true then, that
synners throughe theyr own faut are both depriued of the benefites of God, and also punished and plaged: there is a good cause, whye they shoulde heare suche vpbraydynges and reproches at the mouthe of the Lorde.
That if they doe obstinately perseuer and continue in synne, they may learne in theyr miseries and calamities, to accuse and detest theyr owne wickednes, rather than to lay any vniuste and cruell seueritye vnto God: or if they be not vtterlye geuen ouer, they may, beinge wearye of theyr synnes, wherefore they see theym selues thus extreamelye plaged, come into the way again, acknowledginge the same wyth earnest confession, that the Lord doth laye to their charge.
This effecte haue the chidinges and rebukinges of ye prophets amonge the godly: as it doth appere by the solemne prayer of Daniell,
which is wrytten in ye ninthe chapiter of hys prophecye.
But how such sharpe rebukinges of the prophets of God, take place amonge the obstinate sinners, we haue an example of it in ye Iewes, vnto whome Ieremye was commau~ded to shew the cause of their miseries and calamities,
although it shoulde be none otherwyse than God had appoynted, told before.
Thou shalt, saith the Lord, speke vnto the~ al these wordes, and they shal not hear, thou shalt cal them, and they shal not answer.
[Obiectio~ For what purpose, were those thynges spoken vnto them, that would not hear? PHILALETHES.
[Aun&swer That, wold they, nild they, they should be fain to vnderstande, that the same was true, that was told vnto them, and that it was a plain sacriledge and robbing of the glory of God, to adscribe vnto him the cause of theyr calamities and miseries, whyche was in them selues.
may easely rid him selfe from manye authorities, whiche the ennemyes of the grace of God, are wo~t to heape together for to erect, and sette vppe the Idoll of theyr free wyll.
This is moste sure, that the Lorde dothe speake these woordes by his prophet Oseas: [Obiectio~ wyll go, and retourn to my place,
It were a folish thing (said my gentle men vnto me) if the LORD should tary til Israel shuld tourne and seeke hym, except it dyd lie in theyr power to tourn which waye they listed.
As thoughe the Lorde doth not commo~ly in the prophets make as though he should forsake and caste of, hys people, tyll they amend and tourne vnto hym: but what are oure ennemyes able to gather of suche threatnynges? If they go about to gather by them, that men beinge forsaken of God,
are of their owne selues able to turne againe, then haue they all the scriptures against them: If they saye that they haue neede of the garce of God, that they maye turne again: what neede they to contende or striue with vs? DIDYMVS.
They do not denye but that the grace of God is necessarye: if ye wyll graunte that there is also in manne a certayne strength.
Truely they can not proue it by this place nor by suche like.
For, it is an other thynge to go away from man and to looke, what beyng permitted and lefte vnto hym selfe he is able to do, and an other thynge to healpe hys small strength, as hys imbecilitye and weakenesse dothe requyre.
[Que&stion What doth the lord meane then by suche manner of speakyng.
It is euen as if he shoulde say: [Aun&swer Syth that this rebellious people wyll take no heede to my warnings and exhortations, nor yet to my sharpe rebukinges, wyll for a tyme wythdrawe my self from him, and suffer him to be afflycted, and troubled.
wyll see whether this styfnecked people, wyll at length after theyr greate calamityes, miseries, and troubles, remember me and seke my face.
when the scripture sayeth, that God dothe wythdraw hym self, the meaning of it is, yt God doth take away hys prophecye and worde, wher in he declareth a certain prese~ce of hys.
And to looke what men wyll do, it signifyeth that God wyll holde him selfe styll, and as he were a sleape, suffer them to be manye and sondrye wayes plaged.
And bothe these thynges, is he wont to doo, for to make vs to humble oure selues.
For we should rather by aduersitye be dryuen vnto desperatyon, than vnto anye amendemente of lyfe, except he should by his spirite make vs meete to receiue hys chastisement.
Wherfore, to go about by suche places, for to proue that there is anye such strengthe in vs, or that we haue free wyll to doe what we list, it is a plain madnes.
For, such thinges be spoken in the scriptures for none other purpose, but for to make vs to know oure own infirmity and weakenesse.
dyd aske them, whether they could bryng anye authorities of the scripture,
whereby they myght proue expreslye that a man hath suche free wyll, as they went about to maintaine and vphold.
They dyd then aunswer me that Moses was so sure of it, that he did not doubt to say these wordes vnto the children of Israell.
take heauen and earth this day to record ouer you, that haue layde
Chuse life therefore, that thou mayest lyue thou and thy feede, and that ye maye loue the Lorde your God, and harken vnto his voyce, and cleaue vnto him.
Iosua also did saye vnto the people: Chuse ye this daye, whome ye wyll serue: The God whome youre fathers serued beyonde the water, or the Goddes of ye Amorites in whose lande ye dwell.
Thinke ye that these true seruaunts of God Moses and Iosua, would haue spoken thus vnto the people, except it had lyen in their power to chuse which they would? It is playne then that they had free wyll? elles suche things, hadde bene spoken vnto them in vaine.
Suche sentences and autoryties of the scripture, do not proue that man hath free wyl to do what he lyst, or that he can at his owne pleasure chuse
For, although Moses doth saye vnto the people: do laye before you both life and death: yet it foloweth not, yt they were able of theyr owne selues to chuse lyfe, without the spirit and grace of God.
Whiche thinge he doth sufficientely declare in an other place when he sayeth: Thyne eies haue sene these greate tokens and wonders.
Yet the Lorde hath not geuen. thee a harte to vnderstande, nor eares to heare, nor eies to see.
As then it did profytte the people nothinge to haue seene the greate tokens and wonders, that the Lord did worke in Egipt euen in theyr owne sight, excepte he did geue them a harte to vnderstande, eares to heare and eies to see, that is to saye, except the Lorde did by his holy spirit lyghten their harts vnstop their eares, and cleare the eyes of theyr myndes: euen so, althoughe Moses, Iosua, and all the prophetes of God doe saye a
thousande time: Behold, we laye before you lyfe and death, chuse whiche ye wyll: yet all this, wyll profytte vs nothinge, except God dothe worke inwardely wyth his holy spirit.
Whiche thinge Saint Paule dothe neyther dyssemble nor hydde, when he wryteth on thys manner.
haue planted and Apollo hathe watred, But it is the Lord that geueth the encreace.
But that ye maye the better perceaue the whole matter, ye shall vnderstande that God doth by the preachinge of his prophetes and Apostles:
as when oure sauioure Iesu Christe dyd saye vnto the manne that was sycke of the palsye: aryse, take vp thy bedde, and go home.
It dyd not folowe, that he hadde strengthe to aryse, excepte oure sauyoure Iesus Christe hadde geuen it hym.
He did streyght wyth it, geue him strength to aryse.
Euen so, when God doth by his preachers speake vnto them, whom he hath chosen already; and doth commaund them to aryse oute of the bdde of synne, streyght wyth, hee geueth them strength to do it.
[Obiectio~ maruayle that ye wyll haue no manner of strength to bee lefte vnto vs, in thinges that perteyne to our saluation and lyfe euerlastinge syth that oure sauioure Iesus Crhist him self doth testifye that the manne that went from Ierusalem to Iericho,
by whom he vnderstode al mankinde, was by the theues left halfe deade, and not dead altogether.
Whereby anye man woulde iudge, that there is yet some parcell of lyfe in man, and that he hathe yet some sparkles of righte vnderstandinge and Godlye wyll remayninge in him.
For, wherin els shoulde consist that halfe of his lyfe, that was
lefte vnto him by the theues, that had so sore wounded him? PHILALETHES.
[Aun&swer What if woulde not geue place vnto theyr allegory, what could they say vnto me? Could they lay any heresye vnto me for it? For, it is wythout all doubt, that the fathers haue inuented the same allegory, besydes the right meaning of our sauioure Iesu Christ.
For, ye scope or marke that our sauior Iesus Christ dothe shute at there, is to teache,
who is oure neighboure, and not to magnifye anye naturall strengthe that was left in man.
Let any manne, that wyll, reade the place, and he shall finde that it is so as saye.
Moreouer allegories ought to goe no farther, than they haue the rule of Gods word for their warrant: It is so farre of, that they shoulde suffise by them selues to grounde any doctrine.
How be it let vs see what they shal gette by their allegory.
meane, of our ennemye Sathan the deuil, by whome we wer striped out of our clothes, wounded and left half dead.
First, we were striped out of our clothes and lefte naked: what is mente by this, but that we were by our enemy spoyled of oure naturall innocency and ryghteousnesse, yea and of all other heauenlye gyftes that we had receyued in our fyrst creacion? And not onlye this, but also we were wounded and lefte halfe dead.
That is to say: we were left a liue vnto oure selues, vnto the world, and vnto sinne, but we wer lefte all together dead vnto God, and vnto heauenly thinges.
Saynt Paul speakyng of our redemption, dothe not saye, that we were healed beyng half a lyue, but that when wee were deade throughe synne, God dyd quycken vs agayne wyth hys sonne Iesu Christ.
when he sayeth: Verely, verely saye vnto you: the houre will come, and is nowe already, that the deade shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of manne, and they that hear it shall lyue.
Who durste sette an allegorye inuented by menne agaynste so many playn textes of the scriptures? ALBION.
In deede when doe consider the circumstaunces of the texte, doe perceiue that their allegory is farre from the meanyng of oure sauioure Iesus Christe.
Againe: we doe plainelye learne by the authorityes that ye aledged euen nowe, that we are all to gether deade vnto GOD, and vnto heauenlye thynges, beynge spoyled of al those excellent giftes that wee hadde receaued in oure fyrste creatyon, as Dauyd dothe testifye sayinge:
Manne when he was in honoure, he dyd not vnderstand
it, and therfore he was made like vnto brute beastes.
How be it there be yet certain places behind, which by your patience, intende now to bring fourth, that maye be deliuered from all doubt.
The one is in the Reuelation of Ihon, where the Lord speaketh on this manner: Behold, stande at the dore and knocke.
If anye man heare my voyce, and open the dore wyll come in vnto him, and wyl suppe wyth him, and he with me.
Thys place they haue alwayes in their mouthes, goinge aboute to proue thereby that we haue free wyll.
Elsse why shoulde the Lorde say that he sta~deth at the dore and knocke, and that if any man heare his voyce and open, he wyll come in vnto him? It were in vaine so to saye, excepte it did lie in man to heare the voyce of the Lord, and to open when so euer he doth knocke at the dore.
foremost: what do they vnderstand by the doore, that the Lorde dothe knocke at? ALBION.
By the dore, they doe vnderstand the harte of man.
And they say that the lord doth knocke at our heartes by his word, when he doth by it cal vs vnto repenta~ce and amendement of life, and that we do ope~ vnto him, whe~ we do receiue his worde, and bryng forthe the frutes therof.
When our sauioure Iesu Christe, [Que&stion did preache in hys owne persone, and dyd knocke at mennes hartes by hys worde, callinge them vnto repentaunce and amendement of life coulde any ma~ open vnto him, that is to say, to receiue his word, and bryng fourthe the frutes of it, excepte it were geuen hym.
For the truthe him self saithe: [Aun&swer No man can come vnto me except it be geuen him of my father.
Euerye manne (saith he) that hath hard learned of my father, commeth vnto me.
Wherby we do learn, that except God doth teach vs inwardly, and geue vs grace to receiue his word, when it is preached vnto vs, all the preaching in the worlde canne profit vs nothing.
Then ye may se, how well ye same text of the reuelatio~ of Ihon, dyth serue for theyr purpose.
It serueth for their purpose, as al other authorityes and textes do, that they do aledge.
For why? in al the canonical bokes of ye scripture, they haue not one expresse woorde, whereby they canne proue that manne hath free will, or that he is able of hys owne strength, to thinke or do any thing that good is.
No? why doth Christe say then, if thou wilte enter into lyfe, kepe the commaundements? PHI.
[Aun&swer For if ye had well marcked, what was sayd before, ye might haue perceiued yt it can not be proued by such places that man hath free wyll, or that he is able of his own strength to fulfyll the lawe and commaundements of God, wyth suche perfection as he dothe requyre.
as Saint Paule dothe testify, saying: If rightousnes commeth by the law, then Christ dyed in vain.
But because that ye shall not thinck, that wil go about the bush with you: ye shal vnderstand, that Christ did attemperat order his answers according to the persons yt he did talke withal.
yong ma~ had asked him, by what meane he might obtain life euerlasting, what good he shuld do for to come by it? This yong person was puft vp with a vain perswasyon of the righteousnesse of the lawe, and
also blineded with a folishe confydence and trust, that he had in hys owne workes.
Againe, he did aske whiche were the deedes of righteousnesse wherby eternall felicity, and saluation myght be obteined? Therfore, he is by good right sent vnto the law, whiche is a perfecte loking glasse or mirroure of ryghteousnesse, and also whiche muste be fulfilled, if we wyll obtayn the rewarde of life euerlastinge.
But who is able to fulfil it? No manne liuing, Christ onlye beinge excepted.
Wherby it followeth that all they, that go aboute to be saued by the works of the law, are farthest of from saluation.
The meaninge then of our sauiour Iesu Christ is that who so euer wyll be saued by workes, he muste obserue keepe the commaundements, wyth such a perfection as God doth requyre, elsse he can not enter into lyfe euer lasting, so that the yong man perceiuing his lacke and vnablenesse,
and how farre of he was from the perfection that he thoughte hym selfe to be in, mighte take an occasyon to seeke for the true and only remeady, that our most mercyfull father hathe appoynted for vs, to be saued by, and for to be delyuered from the malediction curse of the lawe, that al menne,
for lacke of fulfyllynge of the same, are subiecte vnto by theyr owne nature.
Saye what ye wyll, my faythfull guydes dyd tell me, [Obiectio~ that it is a playne heresye, yea and a mooste detestable blasphemye to say that a man is not able to kepe the law and commaundementes, wyth such a perfection as GOD doth requyre.
For, if God shoulde commaund thinges impossible, he shoulde not be righteous.
And by the lawe of nature, whyche by the finger of God, is wrytten in the hartes of men, we be not bounde to thinges yt he impossyble, or that
Saint Augustin dothe also testify, that no man dothe sin in that thing, that he is not able to shonne or auoid.
Again, he wryteth thus: can not thinke, that god did commaund any thing that is impossyble,
or that it is impossible vnto God to help to do that thyng, whiche he hath commaunded.
Moreouer they haue alleadged s. Ierome vnto me, saying we do curse detest the blasphemy of the~ that saye, that God hath commaunded man to do any thing that is impossible, and that the commaundements of god can not be kept.
They did also bring in Chrisosto~, wher he saith: let vs not thinke yt the commaundementes of God be impossyble.
For, truely they be bothe profitable vnto vs and also very easye, if we wyll be dilygente or take good heede.
For, after that Moses had publyshed the law, he dyd
whiche commaund thee this daye, is not hydden from the, neyther to farre, nor yet in heauen: but it is very nygh vnto thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thine harte that thou maist doe it.
Moreouer these be the wordes of the blessed Euangeliste S. Ihon: for, this is the loue of God, that we keepe hys commaundements:
These places do sufficiently declare, that man is able to fulfil the commandements of God.
As touching the fyrste sayinges of your faythfull guydes, [Aun&swer wherein they doe affyrme and saye, that manne is able to fulfyll the lawe and commaundementes of God, we muste vse a distinction, that so we maye
vphold and maintaine the veritye and truth of Goddes word.
For, if they vnderstande it of a man, that is graffed, or that hath fellowshyp with Christ, saye, that the same manne doth obserue and kepe the hole law of God,
not really in him self, but because that he is conducted and led by the spirite of God.
And also we may right well say, yt he doth kepe the hole law of god, by the vertue of the fellowshyppe that he hath with Christ, wherby he is made partaker, or rather put in full possession of the perfect and consummate obedience,
and that oure sauioure Iesus Christe dyd shewe and yelde vnto God hys father:
so that hys fautes shall not be imputed vnto him.
For, Iesus Christ doth supply whatsoeuer is lacking or wa~ting in such a man.
And so it may be true, that a man is able to kepe the lawe of God, in Iesu Christ, and by Iesu Christe, but not of hym self.
Augustine saith: al the commaundements of god be fulfylled, when the synnes and fawtes be not imputed.
But if they wyll saye, that a manne beynge separated from christ, is able to kepe ye law of god they ar in a great eror.
For, christ him selfe sayeth, that a tree canne bringe fourth no good fruyte,
But no man is good of his owne selfe, as it hathe bene declared alredye: Therfore, he can not bring fourth good fruite.
Againe, these be the wordes of our sauiour Iesu Christ Byde in me, and in you.
As the braunche can not beare fruyte of it selfe, excepte it byde in the vine: no more canne ye, excepte ye abide in me, Ye see that oure sauioure Iesu Christe dothe shewe by thys simylitude, that it lyethe not in mannes power, to brynge anye good fruyte of hym selfe, excepte he be graffed in Christe.
hath ben sayd afore of fre wyl, ye shall well perceaue that it is so farre of, that manne of hym selfe, and by his owne strengthe is able to fulfyll the lawe perfectely, that he ca~ not wel vndersta~d, one only poynte of it, as it ought to be vnderstanded.
For, ye must note that the lawe must be throughly obserued and kepte wyth a pure and cleane heart,
as Saint Paule saieth: The lawe is spirituall, but manne of him self is polluted, and carnall, whyche thinge he confesseth of him selfe, sayinge: And am carnall, solde vnder synne.
How canne the lawe then, that is spirituall, and man whiche is carnall and fleshely, agree? Moreouer, the lawe wyll be kepte, euen from the conception of man, vnto the laste daye and houre of of hys lyfe, wythoute anye maner of transgressyon or offence.
he that fawtethe or offendeth in one, is gylty of the whole.
Item, the Lorde hym selfe sayeth, that cursed are all menne,
that do not abyde in al thyngs, that be written in the booke of thys lawe, for to do them.
How is manne able then to kepe ye hole law of God, as it oughte to be kepte, and wyth suche a perfection as God dothe requyre, syth that he is a transgressour of it, afore he come in to thys worlde, and a synner from his conception? dothe not Dauyd wryte thus: My mother hath conceaned me in synne?
saye vnto you, that excepte manne be conceaued of the holye ghoste, he shall neuer be able to kepe the whole lawe of God, as he doth wyl and requyre.
Nowe truly do perceaue in deede, that it is a greate blasphemye agaynst Christ, to saye that man is able to fulfyll the hole lawe of God, of hys owne selfe
and by his owne strengthe, and to do it with such a perfection as god doothe requyre.
For that were to say, that man is conceyued of the holye ghost.
But pray you, now tell me, [Que&stion whether God be vnryghteous or not in commaundynge man to do that thing, whiche he is not able to do, and fulfil? PHILALETHES.
[Aun&swer What error or blasphemy were it to saye so? aske you,
if a man wer bound vnto you in a hundreth pounde, and dyd owe you them in dede: though the same manne were not able to pai you, shuld ye do vniustly to ask him your C. pounde? ALBION.
No manne, trowe, would say, that did him wronge in asking him my duety.
When the kyng did aske of his seruaunte the ten thousand talentes,
that he dyd owe vnto him, did he vniustlye or wrongfullye? ALBION.
Know ye then, that all the hole law of God, is nothing els but a commaundement, wherby we are commaunded and bidde~ to pay that vnto god, that we owe vnto hym.
For man is bounde of duetye to loue God wyth all hys hart, wyth all hys soule, and with all his strength: and his neighbor as hys owne self.
Shall we saye then that God is vnryghteous, or that he doth vniustly, asking that thing of vs, that we do owe vnto hym of bound duety? It is so farre of, that he should do vniustly in askynge vs of his duety,
that rather he doth most iustly, godly, and ryghteously to demaund such thynges of vs for the causes that wyll now rehearse and aledge.
Fyrste and foremoste, he doth it for to declare vnto men hys ryghteousnesse,
For, in this that God doth commaund vs nothing in his lawe but that, whych is iuste and good, he dothe declare therby that he him self is righteous, holye and good.
Secondly, least men shoulde seke and go aboute to excuse them selues by ignoraunce, before the iudgemente seate of God, sayinge that they knewe not hys wyll and pleasure, therfore dyd he setforthe hys law and commaundementes, for to declare vnto men, what he wyll haue them to do, and what he wyll haue them to leaue vndone.
For, we are such, yt we wold styll plaid ignoraunce before God except we were conuicted by hys playne and manifest lawe and expresse commaundementes, that he hathe lefte vnto vs. Thirdlye, the law was geuen because of transgression,
to the intent that they, that wold not for the fear of God, and loue of heauenly thynges, refraine
from doinge of euill, should at least for fear of the punyshment of the lawe, be dryuen to keepe a good order, and to lyue quietlye among them selues.
Els they wold haue kylled one an other, no man hadde bene able to haue kepte hys owne, but all should haue gone to hauock.
Forthly, God did setforth his law, that by it man shoulde be brought into the knowledge of his owne self.
the law was geuen and setforthe to thys end, yt it might be a lokinge glasse or mirrour, wherein man shoulde behold hys owne weakenesse, imbecilitye and vnablenesse to fulfil and perfourme the thynges that God dothe require of him, that so he may haue an occasio~ to humble and submit hym self.
For, if it were not for the law, that doothe dyscouer, open and shewe, yea and set before our eies our owne filthynesse abhomination, we wold neuer acknowledge
oure selues to bee sinners, nor yet thyncke, that we haue nead of the grace and mercy of God.
God therfore, least men should swel against hym, dothe demaunde and ask the same of them, that they owe vnto him of duety.
man, thou seest howe muche bound thou art vnto me,
and how that thou art not able to paye the tenth part of that, which thou dost owe vnto me, therfore, submit thy selfe and acknowledge thine own imbecillity and weakenesse, and so flye vnto my mercy, whyche is alwaies prepared for them, that beinge of no reputation wyth them selues, do hang al together of me.
whye the lawe was geuen: which is, that it myghte serue vs for a schole mayster, for to brynge vs vnto Christe,
who is the end or perfourming of the law, for to iustify
For, when we haue once learned by the Doctryne of the lawe, that of oure selues wee bee not able to escape the da~pnation, that we do deserue by the breakyng of the commaundementes of God, then are we fayne to put awaye all vayne confydence and truste, that we had in our own strength, and in our owne merytes, and to flye vnto Christe, who was made accursed for vs, that is to say, was punyshed and slayne moste oppropryouslye for oure sakes, that wee myght be delyuered from the curse of the law, and so receyue the blessynge of Abraham, and the promyse of the spirit through faithe.
as a good scholemaster is wonte to doe, when he hath a scholer, that for a lytle learning that he hathe, thincketh hym self to know as much, as hys master doth.
Nowe, when the master seeth that, he geueth vnto the same scholer, som difficult and hard lesson, wherin he vnderstandeth nothing, or wherein he is as blinde as a beatell, and thys dothe he, that the scholer maye acknowledge the ignoraunce that is hydden in him, vnder such vain arrogancy and pryde.
For, excepte God, shoulde geue hym Commaundementes, whyche he is not hable to fulfyll, he would compte hym selfe as holye and as perfecte as God is: yea, he woulde saye playnelye, that he hadde no neade of God, nor of hys healpe.
But God, for to stop all mennes mouthes, he geueth them a lesson, wherein they be as blinde as beatles, that so they maye be dryuen to knowe them selues, and to acknowledge theyr owne infirmity and weakenesse.
Saint Augustine speaketh of thys matter very godly, saying: Iubet lex vt iussa facere conati, et in nostra infirmitate sub lege fatigati, adiutorium gratiae poscere nouerimus: that is to say: The lawe dothe commaund, that goyng aboute to keepe those thinges that be commaunded and beinge wearied vnder the law in oure infirmity and weakenesse, we may learne to call for the help of grace.
And wryting vnto Asellius, he saithe plainelye these wordes: Vtilitas legis est, vt hominem de sua infirmitate conuincat, et gratiae medicinam, quae in Christo est implorare compellat.
This is (saith he) ye vtility and profit of the lawe, that it may make man to know his infirmity, or co~uict him of his weaknesse, and so compell hym to seeke for the salue and medicin of grace, whyche is in Christe.
And in an other place he saythe: Iubet deus, quae non possumus, vt nouerimus quid ab illo petere debeamus.
God dothe co~maund those thinges that we be not able to do, that we maye learne, what we oughte to aske of him.
to condempn you, and that beyng condempned, ye should feat and that beynge afrayde, ye shuld craue for mercy, hauinge no truste in your owne strength.
and two and twenty sermon he wryteth thus: The lawe was geuen for this purpose, that it should make thee of a high minded persone, lowlye and humble, and that it should shew vnto thee, that thou hast not of thyne owne, strength vnto righteousnesse: that so being poore, bare, naked thou shouldest flye vnto grace.
And then turning him self vnto god, he saith So do, Lord, so do, mercyful Lord, commaund that thinge that can not be fulfilled: yea commau~d that thinge, that can not be fulfylled but throughe thy grace, that
when men shall not be able to fulfyl it by theyr owne strengthe, all mouthes maye be stopped, and no man should seme vnto hym selfe to be high.
Let all men be litle ones, humble and lowli: let al the world be subiect vnto God.
Manye other places might aledge oute of the same doctoure, but these shal now suffise.
is by the doctrine of the lawe, eyther to dryue menne vnto desperation, or elsse to pufte them vppe with a vayn confidence and trust of their owne strength and merites.
And am ashamed that dyd geue so sone creadyte vnto them.
tell me, how the same sentence of saint Augustine oughte to be vnderstanded, [Que&stion where he sayeth: No man doth synne in that thing, that he is not able to shunne or auoyde.
For, some might gather by the same sayinge, that if it were impossible for me~ to kepe the lawe they should not offend nor yet syn in doynge againste the lawe, nor in being disobedient vnto god, sith that they could do non otherwyse.
Ye shall vnderstand that there Saint Augustine dothe speake of those thinges, [Aun&swer
that man is naturally subiect vnto from his own byrth, as is: colde, heate, hunger, thirst, slepe with such other like, which we maye well call humayne infirmyties.
His meaning then is, that man dothe not syn in doinge those thingss for the sustynaunce and preseruation of hys life, whyche he is not able to forbeare.
As, if a manne doth warm hym selfe, when hee is a colde,
or doth eate when he is a hungred and so fourth.
If a man then doth, eat, drink, warm him self slepe, when neede dothe require, he sinneth not.
Who dothe also procede go farther, vnderstandinge the same of Adam before his fal.
For, if it had not lien in hym to wythstand the temptation of the woma~ he shoulde not haue synned.
But syth that he coulde haue resisted, if he hadde would, and dyd not, therfore is he wyth all hys sede, found gylty.
And because that he did not vse well the strengthe, that was geuen hym, therefore, was it iustlye taken awaye from hym, and from all hys posterity.
No manne then ought to say, that Adam and his sede do not synne, in doynge agaynst the lawe of God, sythe that they theyr selues are cause of their vnablenesse.
[Obiectio~ But yet can not perceaue, but that the places of the scripture, whyche they aleaged do make against you altogether: For Moses sayeth: The commaundemente,
which commaunde thee this day, is not hydden from thee, neither far of, nor yet in heauen, but it is nyghe vnto thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thine harte that thou maist doe it.
Christ him selfe who is the true expositoure of the lawe and of Moses saieth also?
And the holye ghost by the blessed Euangeliste S. Ihon, doth plainely speake these words.
This is the loue of God, that we kepe hys commaundementes:
Who woulde not iudge by this that it lyethe in mannes power to kepe the commaundementes of God? DIDYMVS.
brother Albion, thought, that ye wold haue forgotten those places how be it wold not suffred them to be past ouer so lyghtlye.
euen among them that be fauourers, or at lest, wyll seme to be fauourers of the gospell, that haue alwayes these autoryties in theyr mouthes.
That is not vnknowen vnto me, and therfore, [Aun&swer am gladde that they haue bene setfourthe, that by the ryghte expoundinge of them, we maye delyuer those persons from the error, that they be in, or if they wyl not, at least we may warne other, that they fall not in to it.
As for the place of deuteronomi it is most playn,
that Moses doth not speake there of the bare commaundementes, nor yet of any easynesse, that is in the kepynge of them (Some in deede doe vnderstande it of the facillity and easynes that is in the knowing and learning of the~) but
of the couenaunte of mercy, which he had both comprehended and publyshed wyth the lawe.
For, he had taughte a lyttle before, that oure heartes muste be circumcised wyth the hande of God, els we could not loue hym, he doth not then, put the same facility and easinesse, whiche whiche he doth speake of there, in the vertue and strength of man, but in the helpe and ayde of the holye ghost, whiche worketh mightelye his worke, in oure infyrmitye and weakenesse· For if Moses, had spoken there of the bare commaundementes onlye he shoulde haue puft vp the people with a most hurtfull and pernitious confydence, wherby they must nedes to haue caste them selues headlonge in to vtter destruction, if they had attempted to obserue and kepe the lawe, by theyr owne strengthe.
For, when they hadde felt them selues vnable to doo it, woulde they not haue taken to playne desperation: if they hadde knowen
none other waye or meane for to obtayne saluation, and to escape death, but by the perfecte kepinge of the lawe? Sainte Paul then hauing then a perfect vnderstanding of this place, doth applye it altogether vnto the doctrine of fayth.
For, hauinge spoken of the righteousnesse that cometh by the lawe, and how that they that obserue and kepe the commaundementes shal lyue by them, he doth adde immediatelye these wordes: But the righteousnesse that cometh of faith speaketh on this wyse:
Saye not in thy hearte: Who shall ascende in to heauen? For that were to fetch Christ downe: Or who shall go down in to the depe? For that wer to fetch vp Christ from death.
But what sayethe the scripture? The worde is nyghe thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thy hearte.
If thou shalt confesse or knowledge wyth thy mouth that Iesus is the
Lorde: and shalt beleue wyth thy hart, that God raysed him vp from death, thou shalt be safe.
For, the belyef of the heart iustifyeth, and the confession of the mouth maketh man safe.
Who would requyre a more sounde exposition of Moses wordes than this is? ALBION.
This exposition can in no wyse mislyke me, syth that it cometh from the same selfe spirit, that Moses did writ by.
Nowe, therefore, come to the sayinges of Christ, and of Iohn the euangelist.
Such sayinges are moste true, as it dothe appeare by that,
For, the co~maundements of god, of them selues are easy, and if there be any dyfficultye or hardnesse in them: it cometh not of the nature and propertye of the commaundementes of God, but of the corruption of manne.
Heare, what Saint Paule sayethe: what so euer the lawe coulde not fulfyll,
as much as it was weake because of the flesh, that same did God perfourme, sendinge his sonne in the similitude of synneful flesh, and by synne damned sinne.
Two things do we learne in thys saying of the Apostle: Fyrste, that it commeth not of the law, that menne are not able to fulfil it, but of the imbecility and weaknesse of the flesh.
The lawe then, and the commaundementes be easy, and if ther be any difficultye or hardnesse in the fulfilling of them, it commeth of our naughty and corrupted nature.
Secondly we do learn, that God dothe by his sonne Iesu Christe, supply the same, that by reason of the weakenesse of our flesh, we be not able to fulfyl.
Again: the commaundements of god are easy and lyght vnto hym, that is graffed in Christ, and that hathe fellowshyp wyth him.
For, those thyngs that afore were harde vnto manne, are made easy vnto him bi faith, wher
by he is graffed in Christ, as saint Paule doth testify, saying: am able to do all thinges through him, that doth comforte me.
And so the saying of S. Augustin shalbe true where he sayth: can not thincke, that God hath commaunded anye thing that is impossible.
Elsse S. Augustine doth graunte in many other places, that God hathe commaunded thinges, that it is impossible for man to fulfyll, as in the boke of the spirit, and of the letter, and in his thyrde treatyse vppon Ihon.
that they aleadge, bothe oute of Chrisostome, of Ierome, that is to saye, that the commaundementes of God, were easye to kepe.
For, the faithful man is perswaded dothe beleue, that whatsoeuer is wanting or lackynge in him, the same is supplied by christ with whome he hath felowshyppe through faith.
commaundements of god to be easy vnto the inner man, whyche is borne of newe, or which is renued by the holy ghost, God hauynge a chief respect vnto the wyll and desire, that such a man hath to kepe them actually, if it dyd lye in hys power, and wherby he doth endeuor him self daily to fulfill them.
For, it is the duety of him that is renued,
to study daily and hourly to kepe the commaundementes of god, though he be not able by him self, and of hys owne strength, to attain to the perfect keping of the~.
For we must not, because that we are not able to kepe the law of god as it ought to be kept, be slack therfore to do that, whiche lieth in vs, beinge sure that oure obedience, though it be vnperfect, shalbe accepted before God, as longe as we be true members of hys sonne Iesu Christe.
For thys cause did the auncyent doctours speake as they dyd, that so they myght take away
from men, the vaine excuses, whiche they be wont to make because of the impossibility of the law.
was once in a place where hard a stout champion of the Romish church say, that there haue bene, not one nor two, but many, that dyd besydes Christ, fulfyll the law of God, wyth a moste consummate perfection, as Iosua, and zacharie Ihons father, saying that this is wrytten of Iosua: As the Lorde commaunded hys seruaunte Moses, and as Moses commaunded Iosua,
euen so did Iosua so that there was nothing vndone at al of those things that god commaunded Moses.
aske you: whether was Iosua a man, that was conceiued after the common sort of other men or not? DIDyMVS.
beleue that he was a man, and that he was conceiued betwixt man and woman as other men are.
We muste then confesse and graunt that Iosua did go a stray from the law of God, that he was a lyer, and that he was filled wyth manye myseryes.
that be borne of man and woman, that they haue all gone oute of the waye, that they be also al lyers:
howe dare then youre bragginge marchauntes, be so bold to affirm, that Iosua hath kept the hole law of God.
For, these be two contrary things: to be a lyer, and to haue kept the law of God perfectlye.
Againe: woulde fayne knowe of you, whether Ihon Baptyste, or Ihon the Euangelist, was not as perfect as Iosua? Or whether Iosua was more perfecte, than anye of those two, that named euen now? DYDIMVS.
beleue, that Iosua was not more perfecte, than they were.
Heare then, what Ihon Baptist did say vnto our sauiour Iesu Christe, when he came vnto him for to be baptised: haue nead to be baptised of thee, doste thou come vnto me? Sythe then, that S. Ihon doth confesse that he had neade to be baptised, it was a token, that he was infected wyth synne.
And wherof doth come the same infection of synne, but of the transgression of the law? We can not deny then, but that Ihon was a transgressor of the law, and that therfore (if theyr opinion be true) Iosua was more perfecte than he.
cannot beleue that Iosua was more perfect than Iho~ Baptist.
For, it is said of him, that amonge all those,
that be borne of a woman, there arose no greater than he was.
Ye muste then confesse that Iosua was a sinner: if he was a sinner, then did he offend against the lawe.
Heare also what the blessed Euangelist saint Ihon doth say: if we saye,
that we haue no sinne, we deceaue our selues, and the truthe is not in vs.
am sure that Iosua, was not more perfect than the blessed Eua~gelist Sainte Ihon was, who, as ye see, doth put hym selfe in the number of synners.
would fain learn, howe the same that is wrytten of Iosua, muste bee vnderstanded.
For, it is sayde plainelye, that he lefte none of those thynges vndone, that Moses commaunded him.
that the same place muste bee vnderstanded of the Commaundementes, that Moses dyd geue vnto Iosua, touchynge the
gouernment of the people, and also touchinge the brynginge of the children of Israell into the land of Canaam, and not of ye moral law, that is wrytten in the two tables of stone.
For, the same lawe was not geuen particularlye vnto Iosua, but vnto all the people in general.
That same place the~, must be vnderstanded of the commaundementes, that Moses did geue vnto Iosua, concerning the gouernement and guidinge of the people, whyche he dyd fulfyl to the vttermoste.
And what saye ye of zacharie the father of Ihon Baptist,
and of hys mother? For, it is wrytten of them, that they were both ryghteous before God, that they walked in all the commaundements and statutes of the Lord, vnreprouable.
What say ye, neighbor Dydimus, was not zacharie a priest, which did execute his offyce
before God, when his curse came, accordynge to the custome of the priesthode? DIDyMVS.
Then was he a synner, and was fayne to offer sacrifyce fyrste for hys owne synnes,
For, thus it is wrytten: It became vs to haue suche an hie priest, as is holy, innocent, vndefiled, separated from synners, made higher then heauen, whiche neadeth not daily, as yonder high priestes, to offer vp sacrifyce, fyrste for hys owne sinnes, and then for the synnes of the people.
For that did he once for all, when he offered vp hym selfe.
Here haue we a notable difference betwixt Christ our souerain priest, and the hyghe priestes of the law.
Fyrst and fore most the high priestes of the lawe, were fain to offer sacrifyces often because that ye sacrifices that they offered continually euerye yeare,
Again, the highe priestes of the law, were fayne to offer sacryfices.
Fyrst for theyr own sinnes, and then for the synnes of the people.
goe vnto the aultare, and offer thy synne offrynge, and thy burnt offrynge, and make an attonement for thee, and for ye people.
Then offer the peoples offringe, and reconcile them also, as the Lord hath commaunded.
But our sauiour Iesus Christe, who is oure soueraigne and euerlastynge priest, is holye, innocente, vndefyled, separated from sinners, andmade higher then heauen, so that he neaded not to offer for his own sinnes, as the priestes of the olde law did.
For, why? he neuer committed sinne, nor gile was founde in his mouthe: am sure that ye
will not saye, that Zachary Ihon Baptistes father, was such a one.
Againe: All men haue synned, and lacke the praise that is of valewe before God.
Moreouer, we do rede that zachari was punished, because that he doubted of the promyse of God,
Ye maye perceyue then that he was called righteous not because that he hadde fulfylled the lawe wyth suche a perfectyon as GOD dothe requyre of vs,
but because that by the meare mercye and goodnesse of almightye GOD, taken holde vppon by faythe, hys synnes were not imputed vnto hym, but was compted ryghteous before GOD,
as Abraham was, vnto whome hys faythe was imputed for ryghteousnesse.
And of this faithe did it come, that both he and his wife Elizabeth did endeuour them selues to walke so vprightly in the commaundeme~ts and statutes of the Lorde, that no manne shoulde be able to reproue them, or to lay any thing to theyr charge.
In the meane whyle, they cried bothe vnto God, and sayde: Enter not into iudgemente wyth thy seruauntes,
Lorde, for in thy syghte no manne shall be iustifyed.
Hee dyd also brynge in the example of Iosias, of whome it is wrytten after thys manner: There was no kynge before, lyke vnto hym whych so conuerted vnto the Lord wythall hys harte, wythall hys soule, and with all his strength: according to all ye law of Moses.
wyll haue none other but the words that ye haue aleadged for to proue that Iosias was a transgressoure of the lawe?
For, it is writen of him, that there was no kynge before, which so conuerted or tourned him selfe vnto the Lord, as he did.
But how coulde he conuert or returne vnto the Lord, except he had gon away from hym? And we go awaye from God throughe or by synne, whiche is a playne transgression or breakinge of the lawe: Therefore Iosias was a transgressour of the law.
Yet it is written of him, that there was not hys lyke that did so conuert vnto the Lorde wyth all his harte, accordynge to all the lawe.
It foloweth not therfore, because it is sayed that Iosias obserued and kept the law more diligentely than al the other kings that he did kepe it perfectlye.
It is to be thoughte that Iosyas hathe bene a greater zelatoure of the lawe of God than all the other
were, yet it foloweth not therefore, that he kepte the lawe wyth such a perfection, as God dothe requyre.
What say ye, to these wordes of Dauid: [Obiectio~ haue walked in all thy commaundementes, and haue hated all wicked wayes.
Again: In thy testemonyes is my delyght, they are my counseyllers? Myght not a man gether, by suche sayings, that the holy prophet Dauid kept the lawe, and the commaundementes of God moste perfectelye? PHILALETHSE.
[Aun&swer If any man should so do, he shoulde greatlye be deceaued.
For, by such words, Dauid doth only declare the great zele and good affection,
that hee dyd beare vnto the law and commaundements of God, and the good estimation, that he hadde of them.
For, if he shoulde saye and boaste, that he hadde kepte the lawe and commaundements of God perfectlye:
For, it testifyeth and witnesseth of hym, that he was bothe an aduouterer and a murtherer.
But to saye that an aduouterer or murtherer hathe kept the lawe of God wyth suche a perfection,
as God doth requyre that wer a blasphemye against God and against his lawe.
Moreouer, after that he hadde committed suche detestable and enorme crymes, and hadde obtayned forgeuenesse and pardone for the same, dyd he not synne agayne moste greauouslye agaynst God,
when he did rekynne his people? Ye see then, how Dauyd did manye and sondrye tymes offende against the lawe.
dothe he crye oute sayinge: If thou, Lorde, wylte be extreame to marke what is done amysse, oh Lorde, who maye abide it? DI.
wyll brynge fourth all the sayings of that most valyaunte champyon of the Romishe churche, syth that they serue so well for our purpose.
For, through the occasion of them, many goodly matters are discussed whiche (as ye sayed before) serue verye well for this oure communication, that we haue now in hand.
He did in his greate heate affyrme most stoutely that a man was able to fulfyll these two co~maundements:
Thou shalt loue the Lorde thy god, with all thyne hearte, wyth al thy soule, and with all thy strength.
If ye wyll marke diligentely all, that hath bene sayed afore,
ye shall soone perceaue, that it is impossible for any manne to do it.
Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God wyth all thine harte, wyth all thy soule, and wythall thy strengthe, doth require a moste pure cleane hart, whiche shoulde be wythoute spot or blemish.
But who in al the hole world can truely saye: haue a cleane hart? DIDyMVS.
do wel vnderstand all thys hole matter, God be praysed, and thanked for it.
But wyl only reherse vnto you, the communication and talcke of thys noble and valiaunte knighte of the Romish beast.
praye you, brother Philalethes, that ye wyll geue me leaue to aunswer a while, that so ye may haue some brething tyme.
Nowe then, neyghboure Dydimus, let vs hear all the wyse talcke and communication
of this noble knighte, and valiaunt champion of the Romish church.
(Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God withall thine harte, with all thy soule, and wyth all thy strengthe) is not required an actual loue or motion of the hart towards God, but that it is inough, if it be not interrupted by some deadlye sinne: so that, he is compted to keepe thys commaundement, whyche preferreth nothing before God, nor wold for all the goodes and rychesse in the worlde, breake one of hys comcommaundements.
Truelye this is a very substantiall diuinity, and worthye of suche an excellente deuine, as he thinketh him self to be.
How could it be, praye you, that a man shoulde kepe him selfe from offending God, excepte he shoulde loue him actually, that is to say, in
If the hart of man then, be voyde of the loue of God, what good can he do? saye vnto you, that all the sinnes that a man committeth, do come of this, that he loueth not God actually.
Consider marke, what the Lorde hym selfe saythe, speakinge of his lawe.
And thys shall be a signe vnto thee in thyne hande, and a token to thincke vppon before thine eies,
howe that the Lord brought vs out of Egipt wyth a mighty hande.
And when the true and faythfull seruaunt of God Moses, had said:
Thou shalte loue the Lorde thy God wyth all thine heart.
He did adde by and by: These woordes, whych commaunde thee thys daye, shalt thou laye vppe in thine hart, thou shalt rehearse theym vnto thy Chyldren, and shalt talcke of theym, when thou sittest in thyne house?
when thou walckest by the waye, when thou lyest downe, and when thou rysest vppe.
And in an other place, he wryteth on this manner: Take heede to thy selfe nowe,
and kepe well thy soule, that thou forget not the thynges, whych thyne eyes haue seene, and that they departe not out of thine heart, al the dayes of thy life.
Ye see that God dothe require bothe an actuall remembraunce of hys wonderous workes, and also an actuall loue towardes hym.
Iesus Christe also sayeth: if ye loue me kepe my commaundeme~ts.
Again: This is the loue of God (saithe the blessed Euangelist s. Iho~) that we keepe his commaundementes.
It followeth then that we muste haue fyrste, an actual loue of God in our hartes, if we wil keepe his lawe, or keepe our selues from falling into sinne.
Now do perceiue, yt the opinion of this master doctor is abhomynable, and diuelyshe.
Therfore, do vtterlye forsake it, as most erroneous and heretical.
But now, tel me, pray you, how this commaundement: Thou shalt not couet, ought to be vnderstanded.
For, this galant doctoure dyd say, that God dothe not forbyd the concupiscence, but that he doth only forbid condemne the agreinge vnto it, affirming stifly,
that concupiscence is no sinne, excepte we do consent and agree vnto it.
For saithe he, the concupiscences and lustes of the flesh, after baptisme, be left vnto vs for an exercyse of vertue, and for an occasion to merit and deserue, that after we haue manfully foughten in this world, we maye in the other receyue the crown of glory, of righteousnes.
EV. By what authorityes of the scripture did he proue his saying? DYDIMVS.
By the saying of S. Augustine, wher he wryteth, that concupiscence is no synne in them that bee regenerated or borne of
new, excepte we consente vnto the same wicked naughtye workes.
This galant doctor of yours, doth great wrong to s. Augustin.
For, he saith not only, that concupiscence is no sin, but that it is no sinne in them, that are born of new, as ye your self do wel perceiue by his woordes that ye haue aleadged.
For, god saith not: thou shalt not go after thy concupiscences: Thou shalt not bring them to effect, nor consent vnto them: but he saithe plainlye: Thou shalt not couet.
And that concupiscence in them, that are born of new, is co~pted for no sinne, it commeth not of the concupiscence, but of the newe byrthe or regeneration, whiche bryngeth to passe that God dothe not vnto hym that is borne of new impute hys concupyscence for sin.
For, it is wrytten: he that is born of God,
sinneth not, that is to say: his sin is not imputed vnto him.
not: because that he suffereth not synne to raigne in him.
Moreouer wyll proue by liuelye reasons, that concupiscence, that is to saye, all euyll motions of the harte are synne.
Fyrst and foremoste aske of you: wherof commeth concupiscence? of the fleshe or of the spirite? DyDIMVS.
For, the flesh in it selfe is nothyng elsse but sinne, euer repugnynge againste the spirit, as it is wrytten: The flesh coueteth agaynste the spirit.
The workes of the fleshe are manifest, which are whoredo~e, enuy, Idolatry. &c.
aske this of you: he that geueth occasion of synne, is not he partaker of the sinne? He that biddeth to steale, and he that stealeth, be they not both theues? Now, it is so, that euery euel motion of the hart, doth stir vp man for to sinne, and if ma~ doth not assent nor agre vnto it, ye faut and lacke, is not in the concupiscence, that dothe all that in it doth lie to cast man headlong into sinne, but it is the holy ghoste that dothe mortifye the same concupiscence in them, that be regenerated or borne of newe.
Seing then that all sinnes do come and proceade of the concupiscence, and euil motio~s of the hart, we muste neades confesse that suche concupiscence and euil motions of the hart, are euell.
If they be euill, then are they forbidden of God.
For, God doth not only commaunde to auoide sinne, but also the occasion of sinne.
Sith then that we do retein and kepe in vs, such euil motions of the harte,
(Thou shalt not couet) dothe condemne and forbid al euil concupiscence and naughty motions of the hart, and not onlye the frutes that spring therof.
That is to saye: because that God wyll haue all oure whole soule to be filled and possessed with the affectyon of loue and charity, hys wyll and pleasure is, that we should banish and cast out of our harts al manner of things, that be contrary vnto charity and brotherly loue, so that no thought shoulde rise in oure mindes, for to kindle our harts wyth any concupiscence, that might be hurtfull noysome vnto our neighbor.
For, it is the concupiscence, that prycketh and tickeleth the hart, for to in tice him to sinne.
It may be that man shall not consent to it.
If man should consent vnto it, then the same consent, shoulde no
And truely, it is no meruel that God dothe requyre such a perfection,
For, who wyll saye the contrarye, but that it is moste ryghte, that all the powers of the soule oughte to be applyed and geuen to charity? And if anye part of the soule dothe shrincke or swarue from it, mean, from the loue, that we owe vnto God, and our neighboure, al men must nead confesse that it is fauty nought.
For, wherof dothe it come, that any desire to hurt our neyghboure, entreth into our hart, but only because that despisinge other, we do only seke our owne profit? For, if our whole hart wer fully possessed with charity and brotherlye loue, no such imaginations shuld haue entraunce into it.
Therefore, we muste conclude, that the harte is void of charitye, for as muche as it doth conceiue such concupiscence.
But me thyncketh, that it is not meete and conuenyent, that such vayne fantasyes, as do come into a mannes brayn, and afterwards do vanish away, shuld be taken and condemned for concupiscences, which properly haue their of spring in the hart.
Thou shalt not couet, forbiddeth not only those imaginations, that rise in mans harte, but also, al vain thoughtes, yt may by anye meane moue stir vp the hart vnto concupiscence.
For, we can neuer so sone lust or desire any thing in our mind, but that ye hart is straightwais therwith touched and enflamed, whether it be lyttle or much.
But the lord doth require of vs a most perfect charity, which should be farthest from all fleshlye concupiscence.
Sithens that thys matter, hathe bene suffycyentlye debated, thyncke it good, that heare we make an end,
praying most earnestly vnto oure heauenly father, to send his holye spirit into our harts, and to endue vs abou~dantly with the same, that our corrupted and poysened flesh, being through it, tamed and mortified, we may wholly geue our selues to serue him, in holynesse and righteousnesse, al the daies of oure liues.

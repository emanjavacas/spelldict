most prodigious tidings from the north or a most true relation of an angell appearing to doctor james wise parson of the town of greenway in the west ridings in the county of york to whom an angel appeared on the
of march last and an account of the several visions that appeared to him
the land of england hath for these many years been accounted the land of wonders
errors and divisions prevailing the angels of the churches have been dumb but will you now hear the strange

visions and the tidings which an angel who is a ministring spirit hath for future times for the better settlement of many discontented spirits in this kingdom
master james wise minister of greenway in the county of york seven miles from the city thereof walking some few miles to visit a friend of his not far from greenway where his parsonage was did méet in the way with another minister to whom having communicated his mind and being both full of pensive thoughts mr greenway having taken his leave of him beheld where before his face there appeared many strange visions which might have amazed any other spirit but his alone who was throughly exercised in all works of devotion and humility yet he could not be so much master of himself but at the sight of the first vision which appeared to him with a cross in his hand he trembled down upon his knées and hearing a voice that by this you shall overcome he sell prostrate on his face and ignorantly worshipped that which before he too profanely didneglect
in this great distresse both of body and of mind he continued for some certain hours and another vision which carrying a great splendor with it appearing he lay on the ground dank as if then was for the space of an hour till some honest men who knew him passing by him from the ground and desired to know the reason of that his so melancholly distemper
he then looking up as from a trance acknowledged that he had séene many strange visions during the time of that trance and they desiring him to return to his own house because he looked so extreamly ill he beséeched them to let him alone for he did believe that by a peculiar appointment he came forth a selected man to observe those events which would be of great concernment to this kingdom

some there were by who hereupon did urge him with more perswasions to go home and buy some warme meats to strengthen and refresh his weak and misguided thoughts to whom he said he was never better in all his life and if they but knew the least of that with which he was

then possessed with and could but apprehend and behold what he saw and beheld they would not part with the least portion of that spiritual felicity for all the endowments which the world should give them
his friends standing in admiration of him and the evening drawing on they parted from one another and mr wiseman having taken his leave of them and thanked them for their courtesie returned towards his own parsonage of greenway
he had not gone above the length of halfe an acre but an angel as dazeling to behold as impossible to express did encounter him on the way and touching him with a white wand said unto him be of courage and fear not beloved and defended by the powers above
thou hast séen many things unrevealed to other men and it will be thy happiness to sée a great part of them fulfilled

dost not thou see so many crawling and obrious things that are returning to curle themselves in their own beds again they are the many seditions factions and heresies which having béen permitted to come out of the monstrous wombs

of ignorance rebellion and confusion are now returning to their own center they left hell empty to people this nation and to speak truth there was more order in hell without them then there was lately in your nation with them
who it was that called them into this land and did awaken them from their old beds to disease and disrest them this is not a fit place nor time to reveale we have a catalogue of their names above in heaven and they hang in files on the infernal rolls
the world was made in order and it is order only that will preserve it
there must bee a superiority and a power superintendant our all the rest look but on your owe hand and you will confess that it were a very unfit instrument if the fingers were all of an equall length

mr wiseman hearing as well the voice as observing the admirable splendor of the angel remained as a thing lost betwixt amazements and fears when by and by the angel departing from him giving him a gentle brush with his silver wings at his departure mr vviseman did séem

to be more incouraged thereby and looking round about him and resolving to go home with all the spéed that a body so old as his would permit he sound his hope to be intreached upon by despair for to his appearance the sun it being then but four in the afternoon began to lose his light as if it had béen but a short day the beginning of january his absence was attended with many thick clouds of darknesse and to make his words and his fears the greater these clouds séemed to be of several complexions
sometimes they séemed to be of a duskish pale colour as is the colour of the earth sometimes again of a dark gréen and blew such as is the colour of the sea sometimes azure as is the colour of the elements and sometimes of an angry red as is the colour of the fire
the clouds that were of a duskish colour represented several forms and dull conditions of many persons with their arms folded up as if they would be content with any government provided they could but kéep their gold and the dul treasures of the earth with them
there were also many men and creatures to be séen in the dark gréen and blue colour and there were swarms of bats flying like independants in the ayre too wise to own earth and too weak of wing to fly aloft to heaven
that which did most him were many choice and gallant bodies of azure colour and some of perfect white all differing in their stature but resembling one another in their degrées as well in their honour as in their innocence
and it is to be observed that as they were all distinct from one another as wel by their voices as complexions so there was no where any true harmony to be found but in these only
the last creatures in the clouds were some of a scarlet and some of a purple complexion some of them in long coats from their shoulders down to their féet were walking up and down the stréets and whispering treason and because they had not their own order they would admit of no order
a wretched gene+ration of men they looked most of them like citizens and knew neither how to govern nor to be governed
but those in scarlet were most of them on foot and armed either with pike or musquet and looked very superciliously as if they would give laws to those men who of themselves would observe no laws but their own
the sight of so many persons so strange in their tempers as in their complexions and habits did wondefully perplex mr wiseman but a voice was heard the lord is thy guide which voyce did give a new incouragement unto him when behold a battle in the ayre eagles sought against griffins and bears against boars tygers against lions and wolves against leopards the number on both sides séem'd to be infinite and would have amazed the sight but behold in lesse then an hours space they vanished and men sought against men both on and foot they all fought like lions but they who carried their lions passant in their designes were undoubtedly the conquerors

after this there was to be séen a city all on fire a great city and although of innumerable buildings yet hardly able to containe her people
and after that a

cloud of dismall smoake which for a while waving up and down there appeared at the last a finger of fire which pointing to mr wiseman he drew néere unto it and heard a voice which commanded him to go home and declare unto the world this ensuing prophesie
the prophesie
one thousand six hundred sixty and one a great dispute will be and presbyterians must all vaile to those of the hierarchy
at this much murmur will arise and they would all destroy both train men and auxiliaries that say vive le roy
but they shall all be quel'd although their numbers are so many vvhom providence hath armed now shall nere be quel'd by any
three fruitful years of corn will be

of cattel fruit and hay and three dear years after you'l see to eat these clean away
old women this year will dyc a pace middle age with feavours strives in deaths path young babes take their race at seas men lose their lives
the greatest fight at sea will be never the like known before all nations thick us woods of trees the seas a purple gore
a many people will run mad and men will kill their wives the son to wrong his father is glad and untimely lose their lives
for sin great plagues on cities insue the bellconstantly toles to bury two thousand a week will be true lord receive their sculs
a mighty earthquake by gods power in severall places tot'h land send
which will shake stately towns and towers and thus make an end

the great and grievous punishment which by the most just judgement of almighty god fell upon dorothy matley widow of the parish of ashover within fifteen miles of the tamous derby who the ground opening was swallowed up within it for her grievous sin of imprecation
we read in the holy scripture that the ground opening swallowed up the rebellious corah dathan and abiram this was a fearful judgment at which all the whole tribes of israel were amazed and silenced
the like we read in many histories and the sad punishment in the like nature which befell this woman in derby shire is most memorable
her name was dorothy matley a woman noted for pilfering and defrauding her neighbours but above all her most grievous sin of imprecation for when she had wronged any of her neighbours which she would do often and was reproved by them for it she would presently fall a ranting and cursing bitterly and wish that the ground might open and swallow her alive if she had done any such thing

it so fell out that on saturday on the
of march last she had purloyned from a poor boy two single pence the boy missing of his money complained to his mother and told her that dorothy matley had got it from him his mother coming to her found her washing and purging of from the rubbish with which it was digged up and demanded the two single pence of her but she most wretchedly denyed it and wished that the ground might open and that she might sink alive into it if she had it when behold the just judgement of god for immediately at that very instant the ground did open and swallowed her· who perceiving whether she was a going made a

dismal cry and noise but it was in vain for the ground gaping swallowed her self and the tub in which she was washing did suddenly close again
the neighbours and some that knew did dig for her body and found it a great way in the earth but as for the tub in which she washed they could not find it although they digged deep for it
this was a dreadful judgement and may serve for an example to all the god dammers of our times and to all other that are guilty of the like imprecations therefore let them consider of this and repent least they be torn in pieces as the prophet daved hath it and there be none to deliver them
finis

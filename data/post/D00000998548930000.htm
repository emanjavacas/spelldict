[Figure: TREATISE CONCERNYNGE generall councilles, the Byshoppes of Rome, and the Clergy.
THE AVCTORItie and power of general counsayles, ne the tyme whan they beganne, in the time of the new testame~t, ne yet the maner howe they shulde be gathered, or by whome, can not playnely be sette forthe to the reder, onlesse the powers of kynges and pryncis be fyrste knowen and vnderstande: shall therfore in the begynnynge of this lyttell treatyse, recyte certayne textes of scrypture, concernynge the power of kynges and prynces, howe they haue theyr power immedyately of god: and then shal somwhat touche, what mynystrations the~ clergy haue by the lawe of god, andÂ· what by the lawe of man: and that yet many of the lay people haue beleuid, that the clergy hath had power to vse them by the lawe of god.
And then wol touche some powers and auctoryties, that the clergy hath taken vppon them, whiche they had neyther power to haue done by the lawe of god, ne by the lawe of man: ne yet that any custom or prescription can co~firme them, or make them lauful: but that the lenger they contynue, the greater is the offence.
And then after those thynges intende somwhat to touche, by what auctorytie catholike generall counsailes fyrst began and what power they haue: then shall speake of such counsayles, as haue benne gathered in tyme passe, by the power of the byshoppes of Rome, whiche haue ben called general counsayles: and specially of the general counsayle that the byshoppe of Rome hath nowe of late sommoned.
And then shal some what touche ferther, vnder what maner, suche generall catholyke councilles, as be appoynted by scripture, ought to be gathered: and then woll recyte some lawes and decrees made by byshoppes of Rome, and the clergie in tyme past, whiche be agaynst scripture: and so wyl make an ende of this tretise.
GOD tourneth not his yen from a ryghtewyse man, kinges he settith in theyr seates for euer.
And nowe, ye kynges, vnderstande ye, be ye lerned that iudge the worlde.
By me kynges reygne, and makers of lawes dyscerne ryghtewyse thynges.
Here ye therfore ye kinges and vn+derstande, lerne ye that be iudges of all parties of the worlde, leye to your eares ye that rule the multytude and order the people: for power is gyuen to you of god, vertue fro the holy ghoste.
Warne them, that they be subiects to princis and powers, to obey their commaundementes, to euery good worke to be redy.
Be ye subiecte to euerye creature for god, eyther to the kynge as precellynge, or to Dukes, as men sent by hym to the correction of euill doers, and laude of good doers.
Samuel sayde to kynge Saul, whan thou were lytel in thyn own syght, were thou not made heed in the trybes of Israell? and our lorde annointed the king vpon Israel.
&c All the people of Israell sayde to Dauid? thy lorde god sayde to the: Thou shalte fede my people of Israell.
Be euery soule subiect to the high powers, forsothe there is no power but of god: veryly all thynges that be, be ordeyned of god, and he that resysteth power, resysteth the ordynaunce of god: forsoth they that resyste, get dampnation to them selfe, for prynces be not to the dredde of a good werke, but of an euell. wylte thou not drede power? do good, and thou shalte haue laude therof.
he is forsothe the mynyster of god to the into goodnesse.
If thou doo euyll, drede. forsothely he beareth not a swerde without cause: he is the minyster of god, reuenger in to wrathe to hym that dothe euyll, and therfore be ye subiecte to necessytie, not only for wrath but for conscience.
Kynge Dauid sayd to all the people, Our lorde god of Israell chase me before al the house of my father, that shulde be kynge vpon Israell for euer.
Salomon accordynge to the constitution of Dauid his father, instituted thoffyces of pryestes in theyr ministrations, and leuytes in theyr order, that they shuld laude and minystre before the pryestes, after the customes of euery day, and porters in their deuysio~s by gate and gate.
So commaunded Dauid the man of god, and they breke nothynge of the commandementes of the kyngneyther the priestes nor the leuites, in all thynges that the kynge commaunded.
Kynge Iosaphat ordeyned iuges in al the cities of Iuda, and in Hierusalem he ordeined leuites and pri+stes, and prynces of familyes, that they shuld iudge the iugement and cause of our lord to al the dwellers therof.
And ferther he added therto, sayinge: Amary, your prieste and byshop, shal be chiefe in suche thinges as perteyne to god.
In the. xviii. yere of Iosias king of Iuda, the kynge sente Saphan the scrybe of the temple to Elchias the hygheprieste, that al the money that was gatherid of the people for the temple, shoulde be molten and deliuered to smithes to be bestowed vpon the temple: and Elchias dyd as the kynge commaunded, and also sente hym by Saphan, a boke of the lawe that he had founde in the house of god.
And when Saphan had redde it to the kynge, he cut his clothes, and commaunded Elchias the hyghe prieste, that he shuld cou~cell our lorde vppon the wordes of that boke, for he sayd, the wrathe of god was kendellyd agaynste them.
And soo it appereth, that the kinge commanded the high pryste, concernynge the reparation of the temple, and also concerninge the sayde boke, and he obeyed.
Also the kynge Iosias commaunded Elchias the bysshoppe, and the pristes of the seconde order, and the porters, that they shuld caste out of the house of god all vesselles that were made to Baal, and they obeied.
And these textes proue, that kynges haue theyr power immediately of god.
And that they iudge the worlde: that al that be within their dominions are theyr subiectes, and owe to obeye them, and neyther byshop or priste is not excepted in any of these textes.
Of dyuers powers that the clergye hath by the law of god The. ii. chapit.
THE power of preachynge is by the lawe of god: where it is sayd: Preche ye the gospell to euerye creature.
And that might euery priste haue doone in the begynnynge of the churche, as soone as he was pryste, and noone myghte page duplicate] page duplicate] haue prohibite him therof: but after by lawes of the bysshops of Rome ordinaries myght make prohibitions in suche cases, and that hindred trewe preachynge very moche.
And ouer that, the power that the clergy hath, to co~secrate the body of our lord, to assoile, to make deacons, prystes, and bysshoppes, is by the law of god.
And they may also baptise without ceremonyes or exorcysmes, by the lawe of god, and so may euery lay ma~: but none may vse the ceremonies or exorcysmes but prystes: and that is by lawes of the byshops of Rome.
and so like wise the ceremonyes in other ministrations be by lawes of bishoppes of Rome, or by custome.
Also the mynistration of extreme vnction none may exercise but onely priestes. and as for the puttyng away of synne, no prist maye doo it, neyther by the lawe of god, ne by the lawe of man, for god onely of his mercye, throughe contricion, which is the very trewe penaunce, putteth awaye synne, and none but he.
And euerye man that hath offended, muste vse this mynystration of penaunce and of contrytion in hym selfe, and in his owne harte, if he wyll haue forgyuenes: And none other but he may vse this mynistration for hym.
Of dyuers mynystrations, whiche the clergye hath vsed by custome and by lawes of man, and yet many of the lay people haue thought, that they haue vsed theym by the lawe of god.
MATRIMONY was ordeyned by god: as is sayde before and it hath. ii. greate prerogatyues before any other mynistration, that is to say, by reason of the place and of the tyme: of the place, for it was instituted by god in paradise: of the tyme, for it was fyrste ordeyned before all other mynystrations.
And trouth it is, that prestes by custome haue had alway the ministration the solempnysyng therof, and none but they, as to the ceremonies, so it is right co~uenient that they haue stil: but yet it is expedient, that it be knowe~, by what authorite they haue it: and that it may with a cause be ta+ken fro them by the hyghe powers, as it may in dede.
Also confyrmation is by the lawe of man, and was ordeined by the bishoppes of Rome and the clergie, throughe the example of thappostles in the prymitiue churche, whiche by touchynge of theyr handes, gaue the holy gooste in a vysyble sygne, but that gyfte went not to theyr successoures: how be it theyr successours haue ordeyned, that they shall lyke wyse confirme them that be baptised, by tow chynge of theyr handes, and if they that do it be in grace, it maye doo good, and elles it wil do lytel good.
Also auriculer confessyon is by the lawe of man, and it may sometime do good, and be occasyon to bringe in contrition.
Neuer the lesse many of the clergye affyrme, and all the peple in maner beleue, that it is by the lawe of god.
Also satisfactyon, if it be taken as a parte of penance, gyuen by iniunction of the confessour, in suche maner as hath benne vsed in tyme past after confessions, is by the lawe of man: And if it be taken as good deedes of prayour, fastynge, and almes deede, done of deuotion, then it is commanded to euery man by the lawe of god. but yet whiche way so euer it be taken, it neuer putteth away synne, but it maye throughe grace, and through the free gyfte of god, whether it be frely done, or by waye of iniunction and penaunce, encrease his merite and rewarde in heuen.
Also benedictions and hallowynges, as they be commonlye vsed, be by the lawe of man: and if the minister be in state of grace, his benedyctyons and halowynges may do good: but if he be out of grace, then as of them selfe, they do rather hurt then good.
And neuerthelesse many of the people thynke, that the euyll lyfe of the mynyster, hurteth not suche hallowynges or benedyctions, noo more than it dothe hurte theyr consecrations and absolutions, or suche other mynystrations as they haue by the lawe of god.
Also bysshops haue power to examyne encumbentes, that be presented to benefyces, but that is in this realme onely by custome, and by the fauour and sufferaunce of the king and his lawes, and not by the lawe of god. for it can not be proued by the lawe of god, that one prist hath that power ouer an other priste, ne none shoulde be made pristes, but such as were able to take a cure.
Also all holydays, excepte the seuenth daye, and also the precyse fastynge dayes, matyns, euensonge, the ceremomies at masse, and other like, be by the law of ma~: and so is the power of iurisdiction, that the clergye hathe vsed in tyme paste, as to kepe courtes and councilles, to do corrections, and suche other: And yet many thynke, that suche thynges haue ben by the lawe of god.
Trouthe it is, that many of the prayours that be sayde at masse, matyns, euensonge, and diriges be taken out of scripture, and be scripture in dede: but to this intente that they shall be sayd in one place of the seruice, rather then in an other, or in this tyme of the yere, more than in this, or to this intente one time, and to this an other: they are but ceremonyes, for they be ordeyned to be saide in that ordre by the onely lawe of man.
And therfore it were righte expediente, that it were openly declared and knowen, what thynges be vsed by the law of god, and what by custome and by the lawe of man.
And vndoubtedly there is no lawe of god, that commaundeth settynge vp of ymages, but whether the settynge vp of them be prohybited by the lawe of god, that is to say by the xx. Chapyter of exodie or not, is a great doubte to many men: and as it semeth, if the sayde texte were indyfferently loked vpon, it wold appere, that the settyng vp of them is therby clearly prohibite: howe be it, if the clergy be iudges in that matter, it is verye lyke, that many of them wyl mainteyne, that theyr predecessours began.
Also all the inferiour orders vnder deacon, and also these names, Pope, patriarke, Cardinall, and dyuers other, haue ben inuented and broughte vppe by the power of the bysshoppes of Rome and the clergye, and not by the lawe of god.
Of dyuers thynges that the byshops of Rome and other byshops and prystes haue claimed vnder the color of the law of god, whiche it gyueth them not, ne that theyr protence therin can not be affyrmed by custome, ne yet by assente of the people.
FYRSTE bysshoppes of Rome haue pretcded to be supreme hed of the buyuersall churche of Christ, and they haue pretended also, thae they haue bothe powers spitytuall and temporal: howe be it they agre, that they haue gyuen the execution of the temporall power to kynges pryncis, but the power of tight they haue pretcded to haue holly in them selfe: and therfore they haue sayde, that they haue power to depose kinges and pryncis, and that some of theyr predecessours haue donÃ© so in dede.
And ferthermore they haue pre+tended, that by theyr sayde supremitie, they haue power to somon a generall councill, and to commaunde kynges and princis to assiste theym therin.
And that byshoppes pristes and other of the clergye, aughte to haue the voices in suche councilles, and none but they.
Also that they haue power to make bysshops, and none but they: to gyue all benefices and spirituall dignities through all christendome: to be the vnyuersall byshoppe throughe al dyocises, and to bisite in all places seculer and reguler whan they wyll: to haue first fruites of all bysshoprickes, and of all other spirytuall dygnities.
Also that they and the clergye make the churche, and that such a churche as may not erre: and that they haue auctoritie to expounde and declare the doubtes of scrypture: and that all men are bounde to stand to that declaration.
And that they haue auctoritie by the lawe of god to make excommunications: and they except therin neyther treasons, murders, ne felonyes, ne yet kynge ne prince.
They pretende also, that they maye make lawes: and that all temporal lawes muste gyue place to them: also they haue pretended, that they maye graunte full pardone a pena culpa, and archeby shoppes and cardinals haue pretended, yt they might graunte an.
C. dayes of pardone: and euery byshop. xl. dayes, And al bysshops haue pretended, that they may make absolutions in many cases, where other prystes maye not.
And al priestes haue made pretence, that they maye put away synne: and that they maye determyne by power of the keys, who is worthy to be admytted into the kyngdome of heuen and who not.
And all these pretences, and many mo here omitted, whi+che the people haue bene instructed in tyme paste to be trewe, be not only vntrewe, but also many of theym be heresye, and be directly agaynste scripture, and none of them can be affermed ne made perfite by custom prescription vse ne by acceptance of the people: for they be vntrewe doctrines: and an vntrue doctrine can not be reformed, tyl it be clerely broken and put away, wherfore the len ger they contynue, the greatter is the offence in them that maynteyne them.
And amongest other thynges the greatest hynderaunce of the true doctryne of the gospell, and of the perfection of all christen religion, the increasynge of heresies and vntrue doctrines, haue growen by reson of these pretences folowynge: That is to saye, that the bysshop of Rome shuld be heed of the vnyuersall churche: and that he shuld haue power to sommon general councilles: and that byshoppes and pristes shuld only haue the voices in them: haue power to expounde the doutes of scripture.
And entend now bryfely as canne, to touche some thynge of generall councylles: and fyrste wyll speke of suche catholyke generall counsayles as be appoynted to be kepte by the lawe of god: and then of suche councylles as haue ben kepte in tyme paste, by the power of the byshops of Rome.
By what auctorite the catholyke generall councilles fyrste began, and what power they haue.
VVHEN a man maketh a testament, he hath a desyre to haue it performed, and he wyl therfore in the beste maner that he can, deuyse suche wayes, as may moste helpe to the perfourmance therof: whervppon it foloweth, that sythe our maister Chrysle, whiche was and is of moste hyghe wysedome, power, and goodnesse, made a testament, which he wolde shulde contynue to thende of the worlde: that he wold prouide howe that testamente shulde be perfourmed: and bycause it was expediente, that there shulde be alwaye certaine powers in his churche, that shulde se the execution therof, he assygned certayne powers therto, in such maner as shal touche herafter: and those powers he appoynted according to the times then to come in his churche, to the ende of the worlde: wherof the fyrste was the tyme that folowed immediately after his passyon, whan the churche was in the begynnynge, and in maner as in her infancye, to the tyme that kynges and prynces were conuerted: whiche by thauctoritie that they had receyued of god ouer his people, myght take rule and gouernaunce therof: The other tyme was from the sayd time that kynges and prynces were conuerted, to the ende of the worlde.
And for the good order and direction of his testamente in the firste of the sayde tymes, he gaue power to his apostles and disciples, by this texte.
When he sayd to Peter in the name of all the appostles, and of all the hole churche, tyll kynges and pryncis shulde be conuerted to the say the.
What soo euerye bynde vpon the erthe, shall be bounde~ in heuens: for there were none other thenne, that coulde and wolde take the gouernaunce vppon them, but onely they: and therfore the appostles and dyscyples onely without assystaunce of kynges and prynces, or any other of the people, by auctoritie of the sayd texte, in the name of the hole church, for the time appoynted Mathie in the place of Iudas: And they also for thencreasynge of the more loue and honour in the hartes of ye peple to the name of Iesu, altered the forme of baptime, instituted by Christ, and commanded that all men shulde be baptised in the name of Iesu.
And they also chase the. vii. deacons, to mynistre to the tables: that they them selfe myght attende to prayour and preching.
And they appointed also, that the goodes of them that were conuerted in the begynnynge of the churche, if the owners had deuocyon so to do, shulde be broughte and leyed at the appostles fete to the comon vse of the multytude of the Christen people then newly conuerted.
And those directions they made in their owne names, bycause there were then no other men conuerted, that myght conueniently be ioyned with them in councilles: but after, whanne other were conuerted, that myght be conueniently ioyned with them in Councilles, then they toke the seniours of the peple with them in councylles, in the name of the hole churche, as appereth Acto. xv. and. xxi. and that they dyd also by auctoritie of the said text.
Mat. xvi. for there were no kynges then conuerted, that myghte take that power vpon them, as is sayde before.
And al this tyme the Apostels were the hyghe rulers in all the sayd concylles, tils, but when kynges and pryncis were conuerted to the faythe, then the power, to see the saide testament of Christe to be duely executed, was deuolute to kynges and princis, as heedes and rulers ouer the people, and that was by the texte, What so euer ye bynde vppon erthe, shall be bounden in heuen: for tho wordes Christ speke to the disciples, and to all the people there beinge presente in the name of the vniuersal church and that texte is the verye grounde and warrante of the kepynge of all catholyke generall councilles, that haue ben or shall be to thende of the world.
And here it is to be notid, that when Kynges and prynces were infidels, they had theyr power of god ouer the people: and when they became chrystened, they loste none of that power, but had it, and to this daye haue it in moche more gratyous and excellent maner, than they had before.
And vnder this maner beganne the auctoritie of the catholike general councilles in the churche of god: and then to speke somewhat of the power of the catholyke generall councils, that haue spoken of before, thynke veryly, that the power of them standeth mooste principally to declare the trewe catholyke fayth, accordynge to the rules and groundes of scripture: and to declare also, what is to be iuged to be agaynste scripture, and what not: and to expounde the doubtes therof: and also to determine, what bokes are to be obeide and taken as bookes of scripture, and what not.
For all chrysten people muste agree in one faythe and in one god.
Howe be it the correctio~ of them that wold breke or dysobey the sayd declaration of the generall councille, belongeth by the lawe of god to kynges and pryncis.
For it is sayd Eccle. v. the kynge commaundeth the hoole countrey, as his subiette: and therfore, if any man shulde punysshe in the realme of an other prynce, any of his subiectes, withoute his commaundement, it shulde be againste the foresayde texte.
Wherfore the sayde texte, Math. xviii. which was spoken to the vniuersall churche, as is sayde before, is to be vnderstand thus, what so euer ye bynde vppon erthe, not offendynge scripture, ne the power that is gyuen to kynges by the lawe of god, shal be bounden in heuen.
For certayne it is, that the intent of Christ was, neuer to speke any thynge againste scripture, neither of the olde testamente, ne of the new.
For he said, com not to breke the lawe, but to fulfyll it.
And also it is to be noted, that to declare the faithe, or to do any of the thynges, that haue sayd before, do pertayn to the generall councille: is not agaynste scripture, ne agaynste the power of kinges and princes.
For they neuer had those powers, but to correcte offenders, and to appoynte thorder of correction, in what degre of offence so euer it be, without their assent, is against the power of kinges and princis; Ro. xiii. where it is sayde, that princis be punyshers of euery thynge that is euyllc.
And ouer that, if a christen kynge lyued agaynste scripture, to the hurte of his owne soule, and to the yuell example also of all his subiectes, the general councill might declare, that he lyued againste scripture, and against the lawe of god: but correction they myght none do, ne his subiectes might nothing do therin: but only pray to almightye god for his amendement.
Also yf the generall councille decreed, that the youngest sonne shuld enherite in this realm: or that all entayles made of landes, shulde be voide: Or that the clergie shuld haue a iurisdiction, and make proces of exco~munication againste euery man, that breke any of their decrees, all were in vayne: for it were agaynste the prerogatyue of kingis and princis in euery realme: and also against scripture, whereby kynges haue their power, as is said before.
Lyke wyse, if any lawe be vsed agaynste scripture, the generall councill may declare, that it is so: but the correction and refourmation in that behalfe, they muste commytte to kynges in euery countreye, and to theyr lawes.
And thoughe the apostels seniours, Act. xv. by auctoritie of the said texte, Matth. xvi, Quodcun{que} ligaueris. &c. decreed, that the peple shuld abstayne, a suffocatis sanguine, whiche pertayned not meerelye to the faythe, for the meate was laufulle: and neuerthelesse the chrysten people were than bounden to obey the decree: Yet yf the kynges, vnder whom the christen people were tha~ subiectes, vpon a reasonable cause had commaunded them to haue eaten suche meate, they ought in conscience to haue obeyed his comma~dement.
For the eatinge shulde not haue ben against the faith, and that decree was not made, but onely for a frendly communyon and companienge togither of the gentyles and iewes in the beginning of the churche.
But for as moch as the cause of that lawe is nowe determined, the lawe also is determyned: so that no man at this day is bounden to it.
Farthermore, by that haue saide before, appereth, that the generalle councille, laufully gathered according to scripture, may declare, what is heresie, and whatte not.
And thinke also, that by these wordes, Dic ecclesie. si ecclesiam non audierit, sit tibi sicut ethnicus publicanus, They may put a man to aunswere before them vpon the heresie: and so may not euery byshop, ne yet all the clergie togyther.
Howe be it the generall councill maye not thervpon do correction.
For al the correction per taineth to kynges and princis, as haue sayd before, ne they maye not alter the wordes of scripture in any article, as the apostels dydde in the fourme of baptysme, for the cause why the appostels dyd it, is determyned, that is to saye, to cause the name of Iesu to be had in the more loue and honour amonge the people, as is said before, whiche nowe, thanked be our lorde, is vniuersally fulfylled amonge al christen people: and so the sayd example is determined.
Farthermore by that that haue sayde before, appereth, that the orderynge of all ceremonies, of fastynge dayes and holy dayes, excepte the. vii. day onely, of sensyngesÂ· and of all the ceremonies, apparell at masse, matyns, and euen songes, and of al other lyke: be vnder the power of kynges and prynces, according to their lawes, and not of the generall councilles.
For they be not commaunded by scripture, ne pertayne not merely to the faithe: but haue ben brought vppe for the beautifieng of the ministrations vsed amonge the people, and to stire them the rather to deuotion. wherfore dyuers countreyes maye vse dyuers ceremonies to the sayde, intentes, in suche maner as shall be thought most expedient for the people in euery countrey, without any offence to the law of god. but in one fay the and in one hoole and full assente vpon scripture, and vpon the expositions therof, all christen people muste of necessitie agree, as haue sayd before: and to that intent onely it shulde seme that Christ ordeyned generall councilles.
Of such councils as haue ben kept in tyme past by the power of the bishops of Rome, and of the clergie, and haue ben called general councils.
IF MAN wylle saye, and abydingly stand in it, that the byshop of Rome is heed of the vniuersalle Churche of Christe: it is not onely vntrewe, but it is also heresye, and is directely agaynste scripture, Ecclesiastes. v. Where it is sayde: Vniuerse terre rex imperat seruienti, that is, The kynge commaundeth the hole countrey as his subiect.
Whervpon it foloweth, that the emperour, whi+che is kynge in Italye, maye commaunde the byshoppe of Rome as his subiecte.
And if the byshoppe of Rome shulde be heed of the vniuersall churche: then he shulde be heed ouer the Emperour.
For he vndoutedly is one of the church: and than he might commaunde hym as a superiour to hym, and that is directly against the said texte ecclesiastes. v. and if the bysshoppe of Rome came in to the realme of any other kyng, he shulde for the tyme be subiecte to that kynge, and ought to be obediente to his lawes and commaundementes.
And also it is sayd, Sa. vi. Here ye kynges and vnderstande: lerne ye that be iudges of all partes of the worde.
And if kinges be Iuges of al partes of the worlde, what part of the world is left to the iugement of the bishoppe of Rome? And if the bysshoppe of Rome were supreme heed of the vniuersall churche, then he might iudge vniuersally in al realmes: and that were directely ageynst the sayde textes.
It is heresie therfore, to saye that the byshoppe of Rome is heed of the vniuersall churche.
Also to say, that the byshoppe of Rome and the clergie maye make lawes to bynde kinges and princis and their subiectes, is also against scripture, psal.
where it is saide, kynges vnderstande ye, be ye lerned that iuge the world.
For yf the bysshoppe of Rome and the clergie shoulde haue power to make lawes, to bynde kynges and their people: then myght not kynges iudge the world: for they might not iudge vppon tho lawes, ne reforme tho lawes.
For he that maye make a lawe, hath power to interprete and to reforme the lawe, and none but he: and so shulde kynges be bounden by tho lawes: myght not of their owne power iudge the worlde, as the sayde texte, Psal.
Also seyncte Paule, Ro. xui. sayth of euery prynce thus: He is the reuenger in to wrathe to hym that dothe euylle.
And sayncte Paule in the sayd wordes excepteth no maner of euylle.
It is heresye to say, that the byshop of Rome may iudge or reuenge any maner of euyll, by his owne power.
And neuertheles not withstandyng the sayde textes, and dyuers other, whiche proue sufficientely, that the high power of the worlde is in kinges and princis, wherof haue recited parte in the firste chapyter of this treatise: yet the bysshoppes of Rome haue in tyme past, as heedes of the vniuersall churche, taken vpon them, to summon and appoynt generall councils, as they haue called them, and to commande kinges and princis to obey that sommons, and to assiste theym therein.
but yet when kynges princes haue done soo: they, ne any other by their appoyntemente, ne yet any lay manne shulde haue in the sayde councilles any voyces, but bysshoppes, priestes, and religious, and other of the clergie onely.
For they haue pretended, that they make the vniuersall churche, and that such a churche as may not erre.
And surely to say, that byshops and pristes, make the vniuersall churche, is a great erroure: for the vniuersall church is the congregation of all faithefull people, and not onely of the bysshops and priestes.
And of that churche saint Paule speke, Ephes. v. whanne he sayde, that for his churche Christe gaue hym selfe: and no man wylle say, that Christ gaue hym selfe only for the clergie.
Also saint Paule spe kynge of the particular churche of the Corinthians saith thus, Despondiuos vni uiro uirginem castam exhibere Christo, That is, haue espoused you, to gyue your selfe a chaste virgin to one manne, that is Christe.
And by those wordes, a chaste vyrgine, he vnderstandeth the vniuersal churche of the Corinthians, and not onely of the clergie there.
Howe be it the byshops of this realme are clere fro that errour: for they right well and catholikely haue confessed in their boke, called the Institution of a christen man, in the title of matrimonie, that the congregation of al faithfull people maketh the vniuersall churche.
And by reasone of the said pretences, that the byshops of Rome shulde be supreme heedes of the vniuersall churche, and that they might summon a general cou~cill, as they haue callid it, to reforme the churche, as they haue pretended in capite membris, in fide moribus, that is to say in heed and membres, in faith maners, vndersta~dyng by that worde heed, the byshoppe of Rome: and by that worde membres kynges and princes, and theyr people: they haue brought in many gret perillous errours and abusions, as well to the hurte of theyr owne soules, as of all the people.
And ouer that, for mayntenance of theyr own honour, power, riches, libertie, and suche other, haue made lawes directely agaynst scripture, agaynst the power of kynges and princes and theyr lawes, and also agaynste all trouthe and charitie, and whereof they hadde noo power to make any lawes and canons, but onely that they toke vpon them to do it by the vsurped powers before rehersed.
And nowe lette euery manne in his owne conscience iuge, whether it be an indifferent waye of Justice, that the byshoppe of Rome and the clergie shulde be in these mattiers iudges, to redresse the sayde abusions, heresyes, and vntrewe doctrynes, brought in by them selfe, by their predecessoures, and whyther they wolde be dilygente to abbate their accustomed vsurped honor, power, riches, libertie, and suche other, as in this worlde be thinges ryght delectable and plesant, specially if the councill be kepte, where they haue worldly power: doubte not, but that there be som of the clergie, that wolde put therto right greatte diligence: but to fynde many of them, thinke it wold be very hard.
And yet the byshop of Rome hath nowe of late summoned a councyll to be holden after the old fashion: And it he shuld shew him self out wardly to do it for a reformation, in wardly intende to maynteyne forthe the old abusyons, it shoulde be in hym to great a faute enormitie to be suffred.
And therfore it is to think, that he knowith many of the clergy, that wyll helpe forthe his good purpose therin.
Howe be it thoughe his intent be neuer soo good in this matter, yet if ignorance do not excuse, thinke verily, that he, and all that haue moued hym to su~mon it, haue fallen therby into a ryght great heresie, for the causes before rehersed.
And it wyll be very harde to proue, that ignoraunce of the lawe of god shulde excuse any manne, specially them that are moste bounde to haue knowledge of it. wherfore wyll say thus farre, concerninge the said councill, that as many kynges and princis, as knowe the said text, Ecclesiastes. v. and other textes lyke, wherby it appereth euidentely, that the high power, and the high commandement of the worlde, restith in kinges and princes, and that none hath auctoritie vnder god to commaunde theym: and neuer the lesse wyl appere at the sayd councill, that they agree, that the bysshoppe of Rome is heade of the vnyuersalle Churche, and so assente to the saide herysye, and be maynteyners and partteakers of it: and that they also renounce and forsake therby the power, that they haue receyued of god ouer his people, and that they disable them selfe therby to reforme the abusions, errours, and heresies, which through the craftes sleightes of the fende, haue ben brought into the worlde, againste the trewe doctrine of Christe and of his gosspel, and also againste then samples of holy faders in the primitiue chur+che, and wherof there is no truste of refourmation, oncles kynges and princis shortly put to their handes.
THERE was no auctoritie giuen by Christe to oone apostle aboue an other, though peraduenture some reasons myghte be made to proue, that Peter oughte to haue some certayne preemynence before the other apostelles: but entende not at this tyme, to speake of that preemynence.
For what soo euer it were, it can not be proued by Scripture, ne by any other sufficient auctorite, wherby any man shulde be bounden to beleue it, who was his successoure, ne whoo is nowe his successour: so that none may claime any preemynence by hym ouer any other.
Ne it is not redde in Scripture, that whan the power of generall councils in the begynnynge of the churche stode in the appostelles and seniours, as haue said before, that any of the apostels commaunded an other to come to any council.
Wherfore it is very lyke, whan any doute rose, that nedid to haue councill, that the apostels, and seniours, and other of the churche, whose presence was necessary, of their charitie came to it, without any comman+dement: but haply by a charitable and a louynge monition and desyre of one to an nother: ne there is not any mention made in scripture, that there was any excommunication or interdiction made againste theym that came not: for all the mencion that is made, Act. xv. for the gatherynge of the council at Hierusalem, whan the question rose, whether circuncisy on shulde be necessary in the newe lawe, is, that the Apostelles, and seniours gathered them selfe to gether, to here the matter.
And in the latter ende of the same chapiter it appereth, that the apostles and seniours, by assente of the hole churche, wrote a letter to the brethern of the gentylles conuerted at Antioch, Sirie, and Cilyce, in whiche countreys the said question fyrst sprang.
And amonge other thynges, they wrote thus vnto them: For as moch as we haue harde, that some of vs haue come to you, and troubled you with wordes tournynge your myndes, to whom we gaue no co~mandement so to do: It hath pleased vs, gathered to gether in one, to chose then, and to sende to you with oure mooste dere beloued Barnabe and Paule, which shal shewe you, what we thynke. &c.
And it appereth not, that any commaundement was giuen for that gatherynge to gether: but that charitie was the very commaundement therin to euery man, none other but that.
Also Act. xxi. when the iewes murmured against saynte Paule, by cause that as they sayde, he taughte the Iewes in the begynnynge of the churche, that they shuld not circumcise their children: The bretherne at Hierusalem said vnto hym, that vopin that matter it behoued to gather the multitude, and so it was.
But it appereth not, that any commandement was gyuen for the gatherynge.
And haue not harde of any other scripture, that warranteth any suche co~maundement.
And yet syth the feyned power of Rome beganne, it is pretended, that suche thynges as at to be doone in the Churche of God, muste be done by the commaundement of the by shoppe of Rome: and that he muste commaunde all men, as well kynges and pryncis, as other, none excepte, spiritual ne temporall, and that they muste obey his commaundement, and that vppon no lesse peyne then of excommunication or interdiction.
And that it is he also, that is sette to iudge al men, and that vpon his welth vnder god, the helthe of all the people dothe depende, as it is sayd Distinc. xl. Si papa.
And surely these thinges can not be deryuied oute of the mekenesse of Christe, whyche, as he wytnesse the hym selfe, was meke and mylde in harte.
And thinke therfore, that if it shuld happen hereafter, any infydels to be conuerted to the feithe of Christe, that they shuld be meruailously astonied, whan they heryng of Christis mekenes, shulde see suche pride in his mynysters, whyche neuertheles pretend the highest per+fection in Christis Churche.
suppose therfore, that it were euen now a thynge moste pleasant to god, and the most redy way to encourage infidels to be conuerted, and mekely to receyue the faith of Christe, that euery kynge and prince in their realmes and dominions before anye other thinge, reforme that pride.
And as for the gatheringe of suche a free catholyque generall councill, to be gathered by kynges and princis, as haue saide before, it is not page duplicate] page duplicate] to be douted, but that euery christen prince by the generall bonde of charitie, to the honour of god, and to the helthe as well of his owne soule as of the soules of all his subiectes, wherof he hath taken moste special cure and charge before any other: and for the mayntenance also of the vnitie of faithe in Christis churche: wyll fro tyme to tyme, as nede shall require, charitably agree, that suche catholyke generalle councilles, as be before rehersed, shulde be gathered, and to see that suche personnes haue the voyces therin, as shall be thought mooste indifferente.
And if there were a generall councill thus gathered, by auctoritie of kynges and princis, thinke it wolde doo more good at one syttyng, then many of the generall councylles that haue ben kept in tyme paste by auctoritie of bysshops of Rome, and of the clergie, haue done in many yeres.
For the more pitie is, they vnder the colour of reformation, haue maynteyned right great abusions, and vntrewe doctrines, whiche of lykelyhode they of them selfe wyll neuer reforme: but our lorde of his goodnes may reforme them, whan it pleaseth hym.
Of dyuers lawes and decrees made by the byshops of Rome, and the clergie, whiche be not onely vntrewe, but be also agaynste scripture.
IT IS sayde amonge other thynges, Distin. xl. Si papa, that the pope is sette to iudge al men, and that no mortall man may reproue hym: for whose perpetuall estate (as he saith) all faythefull people soo moche the more instantly prayeth, as they perceyue, that of his welthe nexte vnto god their helthe doth depende.
And these sayinges be not onely vntrue, but also agaynste all the textes of scripture, that speake of the power of kynges and princes, and also agaynste the texte of fraternal correction, Matth. xviii, for he sayth in the fayde distinction, that no man may correcte hym.
Si imperator, amonge other thynges, hit is sayde thus: God wolde, that suche thynges shoulde be disposed by priestes, as perteyne to the churche: and not by seculer powers, and that christen Emperours ought to submyt theyr executions to ecclesiasticall byshoppes, and not preferre them.
Nunquam de episcopis, it is sayde, princis be wont to submyt theyr heddes to byshops: and not to iudge vpon theyr hedes.
And howe farre these sayinges be agaynste the trouthe, and howe directely agaynste the power of kynges and princes, to theym gyuen by scripture, It wyll appere to theym that wylle rede the textes recyted in the fyrste chapiter of this treatyse.
Omni timore, heuenly rewarde is promysed without doubte to all theym that dye for the trouthe of the faithe, for saluation of the cou~trey, and for defence of christen people: and yet it is no doubte, but that a man maye dye in deedly synne without repentance in all those cases: and if he do soo, he shall not be saued.
And that sayinge also is dyrectly agaynst diuers scriptures, that speake of penaunce, and of tournynge of our hartes to god: for the very true penaunce is contricion of harte, with a full purpose neuer after to offend, and none but that.
Also Distinct. xix. Enim uero, the byshop of Rome saithe thus: For as moche as the churche of Rome, in the whiche Christe wyl we haue the rule, is sette as a glasse and an example to other: euery thynge that it commaundeth, is alway without denieng, of euery man to be obserued.
And soo it apperethe, that as Christe byddeth precisely, that his commaundementes be kepte, that soo lykewyse the byshoppe of Rome say the as precysely withoute exception, that the commaundementes of the churche of Rome are to be obserued.
And vndoubtedlye that sayenge is vntrue, and was grounded vpon a greate presumption: for the byshoppes of Rome haue made many lawes that may not be obserued, as before appereth.
And there is a lawe of lyke effecte in the same xix. distinction, Nulli fas est, as to the reder wyll appere.
Quando necessitas, the byshoppe of Rome say the to all prelates thus: whan the necessitie of discipline in good maners co~pelleth you to speke sore wordes, so that ye thynke ye haue exceded: yet it is not asked of you, that ye shall aske forgyuenes of your subiecte, leste haply the auctoritie of gouernaunce, by she wynge ouer moche mekenes, might be broken in them, that shulde be subiectes: but yet he agreeth, that in suche case, forgiuenes muste be asked of god: And it is to be meruayled, what gouernaunce prelates shulde haue, that shuld be broken with mekenes.
For Christe hadde no gouernaunce, but that it agreed well and stode hole with mekenes: and therfore he said, am meke and mylde in harte.
Fynally this distinction is directely agaynst the gospell, where our maister Christe commaundeth a reconsiliation to our broder, before we make our offerynge. for this distinction excepteth prelates therof, whe~ they excede in wordes: and yet they be not excepted in the sayde gospell.
Also. xxvi. q. i. Sunt quidam: the bishoppe of Rome sayth amonge dyuers other thynges, that suche thin+ges as the Euangelistes and prophetes speke not of, he maye make newe lawes: and he neyther excepteth lyfe, londes, nor goodes, and that pretence is so vntrewe, that thynke verelye, there is not one of the clergy at this day, that wyl pretende, that the clergye maye make lawes of suche thynges: thoughe peraduenture somme wolde thinke, that they maye make lawes of suche thynges, as they calle spiritualle.
But the truthe is, that they maye not make anye lawes of the one ne of the other.
And yf they did, they shoulde doo directely againste dyuers textes of scrypture, whiche gyue power in that behalfe to kynges and princis, whereof parte be recited before.
And ouer that, yf all the lawes made by bysshoppes of Rome, and other bishoppes and the clergie in tyme paste, were throughly serched, there wolde appere, besyde the lawes before remembred, ryght many decrees and canons agaynste scripture, and againste the power of kynges and princis: and that also gyue more occasio~ to pride than to mekenesse, and that be like wyse righte harde and greuous, as welle to many of the clergye, as to the hole multitude of the people.
And yet it is to be doubted, that yf these matters, and other lyke, shuld be commytted to the bysshoppe of Rome, and to the clergie, to be reformed in suche councils as haue bene vsed in tyme paste, and wherin bysshops and pristes haue only had the voices, that right small refourmation shuld folowe thervpon.
Wherfore kinges and princis now in this daungerous tyme are bounden in conscie~ce, to loke the more diligently vppon suche matters.
And this treatyse intendeth not, that all ministrations and ceremonies, whiche haue ben vsed in tyme paste by custome and by the lawe of man, shulde be auoyded and clerely set asyde, ne yet that defaute shulde be found in the bishop of Rome and in the clergie, and to reste there and go no ferther, but rather that suche abusyons superstitions, as haue risen by occasion of some of the said ministrations and ceremonies, of the bishops of Rome the clergye, shuld be reformed, brought to the true trade of Christes doctrine.
And that it shuld also be openly shewed and declared to the worlde, by what auctorytie the mynystrations and ceremonies nowe vsed amonge the people, and also the power of the bishoppes of Rome and of the clergy fyrst began.
For if true and playne declaration were made in that behalfe, it wolde vndoutedly appere, that the bysshops of Rome and the clergy, haue vnder the colour of the law of god, claymed many mo thin ges, thenne it gyueth vnto theym: and whiche hathe venne in theym a right greatte offence, and hath ben also one of the greattest occasyons, wherby the charitie, peace, and quietnes amonge the people haue ben broken, and the puritie of Christes doctrine, in maner broughte into a hole ceremoniall fashion of lyuing, after the deuyce and doctrine of the clergie.
And if suche thynges were reformed, it is very like, that trouth whiche is God hym selfe, and his trewe doctrines wolde shortly after appiere in the worlde, and boldelye shewe theyr faces throughe all christen realmes.

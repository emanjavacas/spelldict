davids teares psal

preface
who so is restrained or straitned of that he wold next is that he striue and bend himselfe to that he can
so zealous hezekias not being able quite to diuert the iudgement against iudah once decreed yet in this was comforted that in his dayes there should be truth and peace

so dauid louing

the people of the lord as himselfe was beloued of the lord wheras he could not withhold from israel the scourge which on them himselfe had drawne yet chuseth that it may be inflicted rather by the hand of god then man

so moses truly moses

halled vp by the hand of god from amidst the waters of selfeloue and worldly lusts into the pure and feruent ayre of the creators loue supposing his creators glorie in the peoples preseruation together with his owne names remaining in yt booke of gods writing could not stand though both desired yet according to diuine precept beyond

humane obedience seekes of his maker the greater which concerned him though with condition of losing the lesse which did concerne himselfe

so rehoboam hauing nobly attempted but of gods counsell not allowed to bring againe all israel in subiection to the house of dauid strengthens himselfe and his kingdome with cities of defence and captaines and conuenient prouision hauing iuda and beniamin on his side
thus paul the chosen vessell

desiring to depart and to be with christ which is farre better neuerthelesse is content to know that he shall abide in the flesh which is

more needfull for the churches for their furtherance and ioy of faith
thus finally once againe to name that captaine of the holy people the singer of israel the annointed of the god of iacob dauid being prohibited that which in his heart he had conceiued

to build an house vnto the name of the lord his god yet that he doth which was allowed preparing for it in abundance giues encouragement with aduice for that which warre on euery side permitted him not in person to accomplish
this euen this

right honourable right worshipfull and all

right religious in and about london by whose fauour or boun tie my ministerie there hath bene countenanced or any way furthered

yet in another cause is dauids case and at this time mine for he while as without permission yet without intermission too he longeth to satiate his soule with the waters of the fountaine of life

which is with god incomparably more the with ye of the wel at bethlehe~s gate

yet being deferred not denied more greedily but no whit vici+ously feeds on the bread of teares which his spirituall pouertie then his royall demaines

ministred vnto him more abundantly and hauing had in mine heart some while a purpose and in part also laboured not without some of your earnest and instant requests to build vnto the lord a spirituall temple a domesticke church of such materials as you either saw or heard had of my poore abilitie congested for this end being hitherto letted as are the inconueniences of this life from accomplishing the worke do tender vnto your most pious worthy respects an entire excuse in this bundle of myrrhe the drops of the churches dew or teares of gods bottell meane while our intended

building ariseth to his height but as at this time dauid is mine example so that his cause may adde some grace to mine rather that both you and so many as shall vouchsafe to reade these lines may be the diuine gift partake of this his grace of godly teares with leaue we will assume his words to moue and order our affections
induction of the diuision
who hauing told how fro the heate either of inward poyson by deuoured serpents or outward chasing and chasing of the dogges he pants and brayes the fresh refreshing welsprings to obtaine adding declares his paines

and practise while as he seekes and runnes saying my teares haue bene my meate day and night while they say vnto me all the day where is thy god for the hart they say who are wont to hunt sheds teares some thing like being pursued and not able to escape

this griefe of his he amplifies by declaration of the cause and manifestation of the effect
the effect in nature last but first in sense first in order of these words is considerable subdiui&sion in his name teares and property mine and vse bread and reference to me and time day and night

of these shortly each in particular according

to their present standing briefly and after of teares more largely which chiefly are intended and last of the common and weightiest cause in the latter part of the verse

ob&seruatio and first by the effect of teares we are admonished the saints in those that are called delights haue no delight whe god is dishonoured or themselues though vniustly are afflicted but to prayers and teares they giue the~selues
for as touching pleasures dauid might haue said that which his sonne confirmation
what can the man that cometh after the king

hauing so faire occasions and alluring prouocations yet in this case he

chooseth to say with the church my confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face hath couered me for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason of the enemie and auenger and with paul to tell euen with weeping of the enemies of the crosse of christ

as hezekiah also his sonne no lesse in faith then in the flesh to rent his clothes and couer himselfe with sackcloth and to go vnto the house of the lord relating the speeches and reading the blasphemies of senacherib and rabshakeh rather then after ye guise of godlesse men to kill oxen and slay sheepe enioying the pleasures of sin for a season when

the lord by trouble calleth to weeping and mourning

rea&son
for on the one side gods reproch they account their owne whose voice is the reproches of them that reproched thee are fallen vppon me

on the other side gods corrections are their instructions

and his scourges the arguments of their transgressions
hence ephraim after that was instructed smote vpon my thigh was ashamed yea euen co~founded because did beare the reproch of my youth

application
wherefore want of sense in such distresse is too plaine a testimony of much impietie
for whether we speake of not sorrowing for gods dishonour so often

he threatning them that are not extremely wicked with exposing of his owne honour to ignominie

for their extreme punishment

it shewes they are out of hope

that are not at all therewith affected

whereby well may be guessed of what stampe they are who in theaters and such like meetings not onely with patience but with content yea with delight heare blasphemie and behold vncleannesse to whom the lord saith ye which reioyce at a thing of nought of whom the apostle saith who knowing the iudgement of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not onely do the

same but haue pleasure in them that do them
or if we speake of impenitencie vnder the rod of god such hardnesse himselfe in the prophets condemneth as a note of desperate impenitencie in vaine saith he haue smitten your children they receiued no correction
and in another after enumeration of diuerse chastisements yet prouing fruitlesse this conclusion he infers the virgine of israel is fallen she shall no more rise
this in the same prophet is likened to horses running vpon a rocke

where first they breake their hoofes then their neckes
whose crime esay thus declares

denouncing withall

a iudgement proportionall to their offence for the people turneth not vnto him that smiteth them neither do they seeke the lord of hoasts therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and taile branch and roote in one day
this is the disposition of them whom when god fatherly calleth by correction to repentance contemning the smiter in his rod drowne the voice both of his iudgments and their owne sinne with wine and wantonnesse merrie companions and such like auocations against whom it shall suffice to adde ieremiahs complaint request to god against them lord are not thine eyes vpon

the truth thou hast striken them but they haue not grieued thou hast consumed them they haue refused to receiue correction they haue made their faces harder then a rocke they haue refused to returne
wherfore by mine award haraclitus shall be a better christian then them both who wept vpon euery meeting of man remembring the common calamitie of their kind

wherefore herein let vs not be fashioned like vnto this world

but imitate rather either wrathfull reuenging moses

or humbly mourning hezekias

we

if either the friends of god like faithful abraham

or sonnes of god

as christ the lord

let vs not heare with patience either his reproch by others or anger against our selues
vrias while the arke and israel iuda abide in tents whilest his lord ioah and seruants of his lord encampe in the open field is neither intreated nor perswaded nor by what euer importunity moued to go into his house to eate or drinke or to lie with his wife
and behold a greater then the arke and israel and iuda and ioab and the seruants here and exposed to greater iniurie not of elementary aire but of blasphemous breath and blacke choler issuing our of hearts that boile on the infernall fire
meroz bitterly

by angels voice is cursed for not helping the lord against the mightie and shall we looke to be blessed laughing with those that sight against him

ob&seruatio
yet further dauid full of spirit instructeth vs the weapons of the faithfull how valorous soeuer are their teares to god
confirmation
for when at the graue of abner he laments the losse of such a prince in israel

he can no otherwise deprecate the crime of murther committed by his seruant then by the protestation of his teares
so he or what other holy penman of the psalme expresseth the people of god reuenging their enemies

reproaches by weeping

this was also iobs refuge my friends scorne me but mine eye powreth out teares to god
thus at length to mentio no more the tribes of israel once and againe before a yonger scandalous brother beniamin

put to the worst in weeping with fasting confession of sin at length obtained that victory which multitude might and counsell and weapons of warre could not effect
amplificatio
for in this sort hath god shewed he will be sought and found intreated and perswaded therefore also now saith the lord turne ye euen to me with all your heart and with fasting and

with weeping and with mourning

application
but these vnto our scythians both men and amazonian damsels seeme too too childish betweene whom what difference that scorne to weepe and witches of whom they report they cannot weepe sure the enemy when he hath slopt the wels and stayed the water courses of the towne hath good hope thereby to ouercome with such holophernes practise its most like that satan hath captiuated these bethulians
men why do you not perceiue this hath euer bene the custome of philistines israels aduersaries to stop the springs but

heare whosoeuer thou art what valour of thine is this which while it fetters thee with the chaine of pride makes thee the slaue of vile affections is there more strength in thy bodie or courage in thy breast then with him who being but a stripling slue the lion and the beare who yet scarce a man destroyed the giant that defied the armies of the liuing god who finally in riper yeares being high marshall of the lord his hoast most valiantly most happily fought his battels

me thinks not vntruly saul may be accounted better then these who in acknowledgement of his offence wept with lifting

vp his voice but these their eyes are no moyster then a flint because they haue made their faces harder then a rocke refusing to returne to whom the infusion of many hogsheads of wine is more easie

then the distilling of one teare who may well say as in the poet our kinred by kind is drie eyed

wherefore leauing vnto these their valour as fabius sometime vnto tarentum her armed gods imitate we our dauid and esay ieremiah and paul and peter with timothie also and iesus especially the lord of heauen and earth whose teares are the ioy of the world and let the ancient

prouerbe stand mournfull men are good men
poure we out our heart before him saying god is arefuge for vs and how much soeuer among vs any is more then other inclined to religious weeping let him be esteemed so much the better as in comparison of two religious dauid and ionathan the holy scripture hath implyed
these are the childrens weapons to whom by our father we are likened who hath also bid vs on this to leane vengeance is mine will repay saith the lord onely let these teares be sanctified vnfained teares
therefore dauid thus addes to teares my teares

ob&seruatio
for not euery teares are dauids dainties the drinke offerings of transgressors he will not offer

neither suppose will he set on the lords board the bread of deceitfull men

for that you may vnderstand teares are not of one kind

as weepers are not of one mind
there are saith saint augustine teares commendable

and teares culpable to which adde neutrall that are middle betweene both the other

or yet that you may haue a more commodious diuision

teares are some of a cause materiall to wit of a swifter motion of the body specially against a sharper wind or in the colder

ayre or else of some humide affection of the body chiefly of the eye which therefore are neither iustly commended nor condemned

others are from a cause intellectuall that is of an affection or motion of the mind and these diuerse some from a weaknesse of spirit or too tender affection often vndiscreet

and therefore not allowed rather as much laughter to be blamed

others of a naturall pietie such were they of lazarus his sisters

and of the iewes that mourned with them
these proceeding from pure nature none suppose except zeno his

disciples can discommend which are approued not onely by the example of those deuout that buried stephen and of many of the saints

but of our lord iesus also the author of vncorrupted nature and sanctifying grace

moreouer too many teares are occasioned by temporall losses

plainly to be reproued as also the sorrow from which they flow
for the iust man bewaileth truly those that weep most part vainly

such are they that howle vpon their beds whe they assemble themselues for corne and wine and yet they rebell against me saith the lord
of these is the greater number who while

they weepe for such they cannot seek the lord
like they are to those that in ezekiel mourne for tammuz their idoll at the north that is the cold gate of the lords house being frozen in fleshly lusts and worldly cares they sit deuoide of the southerne that is the celestial warmth of gods loue

there are yet other forced and fained teares lying waters which are said chiefly to be womens weapons of the which being demanded which waters were deepest and most deceitfull one answered on this wise some limpide streame disclosing ground

but depth concealing deceitfull proues much more more often womans teares of wise foole makes him that loues
such as in the dipnosophist was the strumpet phryne

for this cause named undefined span alphabet as if you would say because commonly she did both together hauing in the midst of laughter teares at command
as he also spake of them which of them had too much experience their teares at will for to distill they teach their eyne
as the comedian also speakes of the yong man which goeth after her as a foole to the correction of the stockes

howeuer vpon contempt

he hath sworne no more to come at her which hath despised himself preferred his corriual chusing death before such disdain

yet some one teare which painfully rubbing of her eyes she hardly hath brought forth will make voide those words so that he shall accuse himselfe
and this no longer to insist in forreine speech sampsons example doth too truly teach

and indeed no lesse the prophets admonition doth imply chargeing keepe the doores of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy bosome

meane while neither will charge that whole sexe herewith that may not seeme to condemne

the rest for the fault of most nor it alone for such were xerxes teares reported to haue bene

which wept for the fall of those whom shortly by the sword of others he meant to slay and which is most worthy to be wailed in most places many may be seene who in holy assemblies haue weeping for a complement of hearing
as of the brasilians also is reported

whose facilitie is such that teares are for a present salutation and as soone gone as if they had said how do you such our hearers saint bernard liuely thus describeth behold some weeping but if those teares proceeded from the

heart then should they not so lightly be turned into laughter but now whereas wanton and scurrilous speeches are vitered more abundantly the teares before thinke not those teares are such as diuine comfort is promised vnto whereas after them so vile and earthly consolation so easily is admitted

saint ierome reports of nepotian he sacrificed his teares to god and not to man but they in this behalfe haue postposed god to man

now with no more cruell minde shew you the sixt

but most cruell kind by name the crocodile his teares who they write hauing deuoured a man weepes ouer the scull when

nothing is left not repenting of his deed but because on that bone there remaines no flesh to eate
which hieroglyphicke it is said sigismund gonzaga a cardinall vsed of leo the tenth repenting that by his meanes he was aduanced to the popedome adding this embleme crocodili lachrymae
such were the fained teares of bassian the emperour who wept vpon euery hearing the name or seeing the picture of geta his brother whom he had caused secretly to be slaine
such were the teares of demoneta the stepmother for cnemon her sonne whom neuerthelesse by subornations she laboured

to destroy
to these of this age you may annumber many doubtful friends yea such as when they purpose to insnare couer all with the mantle of religió whom ishmael the sonne of nethaniah in the slaughter of the shechemites and shilumtines and samaritan votaries

in ieremiah egregiously resembled for he hearing of their coming with shauen beards and clothes rent hauing cut themselues with incense in their hand to bring to the house of the lord went out from mizpeh where he had slaine him that began to gouerne in the feare of god weeping all along as he went and as if he would

haue ioyned his supplications with theirs or rather in religion haue preuented them intreated them to come with him to gedaliah the gouernour but when he had brought them whither he would into the midst of the citie then slue them and cast them into a pit like in resemblance to that which iob saith

his friends digged for him sparing onely those that had in the fields treasures to disclose vnto him

to perfection of number was wanting but the seuenth kind of teares in vain altogether or most part employed here behold the backsliding daughter of rome shewes her foolish

forwardnesse presenting as vaine if not so wicked a sort as any of the rest of her owne inuention namely of those which are shed not willingly but by compulsio wherewith they are tasked who for plenary satisfaction for their sinnes to god are adiudged to an outward and forced lamentation for some part or the whole residue of their life within monasteries or abroad of which teares well speakes father isac in iohn of cassia

saying by their straining they more abase and drowne the soule of him that prayeth pulling it downe from that heauenly height wherein the suppliants mind should vnremoueably

be fixed and so compell him losing the prime intention of deuotion to be sicke in seeking fruitlesse and constrained drops of teares
where we reade the valley of mulberrie trees

saint ierome renders ex aduerso flentium

ouer against them that weepe whereon he thus commenteth saying the philistins had an idol whereto they sacrificed with mens teares
betweene which idoll and our god would know what difference they put that for diuine and spiritual worship vrge teares and like exercise of constraint as though in them for themselues he were pleased

the eight and onely at

all times laudable kind of teares are those of sincere religion contrition compassion and heauenly desire whereof we haue next to speake
for onely these we obserued before dauid calls his owne teares my teares ob&seruatio
and that not onely in kind but also in number not onely that they were his that is godly such as he vsed but also they were those which onely himselfe did shed

for not indifferently the teares of any but of our selues must make request to god for vs so of the church it is said her teares are on her cheekes
and our lord to the daughters of ierusalem weepe for your

selues and for your children
so the lord to hezekiah the king giues testimonie haue heard thy prayer haue seene thy teares

application
which against them is to be noted who if they commend themselues to the prayers of some deuout persons if happily they build some hospitals for those that in age solitarinesse and sicknesse shall lament meane while themselues be resolued into all lasciuiousnesse are fully perswaded god is with them well appeased which if it be righteousnesse know not wherein simon magus attempting to buy the holy ghost with mony

hath at all offended

such other offence is that when in the morning vnblest going to mingle strong drinke

to vse the prophets words or else about vngodly mercha~dise they hire with a little mony some shaueling to say their prayers in certain aues and paters and credoes by a rate
it was easie for israel to say to samuel pray for thy seruants vnto the lord thy god that we die not while as themselues ate the calues out of the stall and chanted to the sound of the viole
it was easie for simon of whom we spake to intreate the apostles pray yee to the lord for me that none of these things which yee haue spoken come vpon me

but no heart he had to ioyne his owne voice with them
it is like dauid who wept and chastened his soule with fasting

was not ignorant of the gentiles prouerbe weeping becometh not a king

yet being a king he counteth it no shame to sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes

caution
yet say not it is vnlawfull to request or vnprofitable to haue the prayers of the lord his seruants
the aduenturous hester putting her life in her hand for her peoples cause

bids mordecai gather together all the iewes that were present in shushan and fast yee saith she for me
and amos preacheth they shal call the

husbandman to mourning and such as are skilfull of lamentation to wailing
and in ieremie thus saith the lord of hosts consider yee and call for the mourning women that they may come and send for cunning women that they may come and let them make haste and take vp a wailing for vs
but most agreeing is his precept by the prophet ioel let the priests the ministers of the lord weepe betweene the porch and the altar and let them say spare thy people lord and giue not thy heritage to reproch that the heathen should not rule ouer them
and hezekiah to conclude by messengers saith to esay lift vp thy prayer for the remnant

that are left
in all which places we may perceiue the holy people allowed accustomed to vse the prayers of others with their owne yet so as alwayes appeares the concurrence of their owne with others

ob&seruatio
in this wise as many as here sow in teares hope for increase whereof they shal not be deceiued

the which their future expectation euen in their teares procures a present consolation
this is that vse of teares which dauid implies whereas he saith they haue bin my bread for teares oft times both feed and ease the minde

weeping saith one cooles the stomacke and solaceth the troubled spirit
in weeping

holy affections haue their proper pleasure and so most part surcharging melancholy is expelled
therefore the prophet requests turne away from me that may weepe bitterly
now we know delight is presupposed to follow whe the desire is obtained
so the people in babylon remembring ierusale in bitternesse find no sweeter leniment then this upon the riuers of babylon there sate we downe yea we wept when we remembred sion
wherefore else doth ieremie wish so earnestly that my head were waters mine eyes a fountain of teares it was leisure for such emploiment that iob of his

friends so earnestly required hold your peace let me alone that may speake and let come on me what will
therefore it is the prophet elsewhere eates ashes like bread and mingles his drinke with weeping

amplificatio
hereof may reason be conceiued from the obiect or from the subiect or from the circumstance of time
from the obiect in that whatsoeuer is done or suffered for that which is beloued is delightfull as laecobs suffering cold and labour and sweat

for the loue he bare vnto his desired rahel
moreouer if this the louer know that his deeds or sufferings are pleasing to his beloued so

much the more are his ioys increased

hence marie magdalen her presenting our lord with teares amidst a feast because she knew they should haue better acceptance then the pharisees costly cheare

from the subiect which either is ioyfull in it selfe for not onely sorrow but also abundant solace sometimes makes men to weep

as ioseph wept ouer his yongest brother for gladnesse of their bodily meeting and againe

ouer all the elder for recouerie of their soules in conuersion

for it is naturall to man to weepe as really though not so frequently in mirth as mourning
and as often

as the bowels are bound with excessiue motion of heauinesse or of gladnesse straight waters gush out of the eyes
or if they proceed from sorrow it selfe then conuenient gesture addes delight to euery action

and no gesture is more sutable to sorrow then sighs and teares which nature hath annexed thereunto

the circumstance also of time supports with a double foundation this position

for in regard of time present

as hindes by caluing so men by weeping

cast out their sorrowes
as waters by powring so sorrow in lamenting issueth out
for as saint basil saith when they are emptied

the braine is lightned like as the element is cleared after raine
therefore the philosopher aduiseth

not lightly to still children from crying
and in respect of time to come the hope of great reward changeth no lesse the bitternesse of these waters then the tree shewed by god

those of marah while beleeuing we remember him that said blessed are ye that weep now

for ye shall laugh
and gaine they that sow in teares shall reape in ioy

application
much therefore they are mistaken that esteeme the saints miserable when they

are in lamentation whose prouerbe they become

whe sackcloth is their garment
selfewild are these and ignorant that out of the eater comes forth meate and out of the strong sweetnesse comes
when contrariwise euen experience hath taught

by apoplexies and palsies and sudden deaths how vnhelpful yea hurtful it hath bene for many violently to refraine from teares being beset of remedilesse euils
for euen the flame inclosed is choked of his smoke which hauing no vent it selfe reflects and smothers the fire that bred it no otherwise in the liuing creature that facultie which doth dispense the

vitall actions decayes and dies by the cagernesse of immoderate griefe hauing no outward expiratio
and on the other side the issuing of matter from an vlcer easeth the smart which tumour bred
wherefore as it is wicked so it is vain to account mourning miserable which god hath pronounced happie
it is more reasonable to esteem those teares euen in the present ioyfull which procure gods presence delight the angels are a terrour to diuels support the feeble and solace all stronger christians
whereof for this time onely this list to adde this worthy is of most abundant teares

that teares amongst christians are so rare
if carnall men lament that the new wine is cut off from their mouth if the priests are iustly charged to mourne betweene the porch and the altar that the drinke offering is withholden from the house of god which notwithstanding is but the bud of an earthly grape how much more cause haue to bewaile the drinesse of my soule who will say with the prophet shall giue water to my head and teares vnto mine eyes yet not altogether or onely for the selfe same reason he for the breaking of his people for the emptinesse and barrennesse of

my soule
for so husbandmen

are wont specially in the hotter regions in time of drought by deriuing riuerets from wels or ponds to water their thirsty lands lest else hauing by too much drought lost all strength they faile to multiply the seeds of increase
ah my god for the wickednesse

of the inhabitants the field of my heart hast thou turned to barrennesse
for therein dwell thine enemies indeed yet not my friends ambition anger auarice wantonnesse headinesse slothfull sleepe and dulnesse many more of whom more easily any one doth leade me captiue then am able

to recount them all
my soule thy strength my strength is dried like a potsheard


wherefore consider with me my brethren what all israel did in such distresse and vnderstand by that they did what they wailed what they would for being somtime themselues forced at mizpeh

to force from their eyes some teares and yet that neither this they could for it was not easie to do this good how e're they declined their former euill in testimony of their inward emptinesse they drew vp other waters and powred before the lord
here we need not rabhi vziel his authority to teach that the

soule without teares is as the thirsty land

whereas the holy scripture so speakes

tran&sition
it was somewhat strange to perswade a carnall man that to the spirituall his teares are a pleasure but this being granted a thrifty man will soone beleeue they are also profitable
ob&seruatio
for he beleeues without profit a wise man hath no pleasure
wherfore obserue we next the proper vse yt dauid had of them in this also that dauid saith they haue bene my bread where with in another psalme he saith confirmation


that great housholder doth furnish his childrens table thou feedest them with the bread of teares and giuest

them teares to drinke in great measure
like may this be to that that iob

affirmes my sighing cometh before eate and againe haue laid vp the words of his mouth before my necessarie food so hanna

the mother of that sonne of vowes she wept and did not eate that is weeping to her was in stead of eating
for that other meate the saints especially in times of trouble they loath
ate saith one no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did annoint my selfe at all till three whole weekes were fulfilled
and of another

vpon lesse occasion it is said that he did eate no bread

amplificatio for spirituall graces are their cates and iunckets and most desired meates which when they faile with this though courser bread they do more freely fill themselues
and yet besides bread strengtheneth the heart of man

so do saith one

the promises that are made to teares
for those that are patient in tribulation according to saint paul reioyce in hope
so much the more as they are more clearly called thereunto by example of his preceeding teares and succeeding ioyes of whom it is written who in the dayes of his flesh when he had offered vp prayers and supplications with strong crying

and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death and was heard in that he feared

application
saint bernard hath obserued seauen sorts of bread whereon they of the kings house do feed
one is of hearing the words of god another is of obedience or doing the workes of god athird is meditation on them both a fourth is repentance in case of negligence in either of those or both
the fifth is of sociable vnanimity
a sixt the holy eucharist the formers pledge and seale of the couenant betwixt our lord and his elect
the last is this we are yet a kneading of praying teares or weeping prayers
the condition of

which is such not that he who feeds on one or more should therefore loath the rest but contrariwise the eating of any one or some whets the stomacke for the rest whereby we gather how few are satisfied with this how many perish in spirituall famine vnawares
who is he that will giue to me this bread to eate whom if haue it in these dayes shall call to such repast which of them that daily feast will vouchsafe to be my guest but to vse our bread in a larger that is the scriptures sence for all manner of victuals the most filling the~selues with sundry sorts of leauened cakes poore wretches

wretchedly refuse these bitter hearbes

which neuerthelesse as cates were to be ioyned with the vnleauened bread of a sincere and christian conuersation if so be we desired without hypocrisie to be partakers of our lords feast
but this diet what vse it hath for health or strength the world knoweth not therefore neither doth desire it
who bewailes the want of an vnknowne good

cast a and one accustomed to the light together into the darknesse of a dungeon the ones experience makes him to lament the other without losse laughs in ignorance so right so here it is the

country swaine will disdaine to stoope to ground for that which is precious in his lords esteeme bruit beasts deuoyd of reason and therefore vncapable of miserie bred by nature to exhale their breath in pleasure of their senses soone as they see the ayre the originall of their life expresse each of them some kind of wantonnesse the horse pranceth the oxe casts dust into the ayre the sowe delighteth in digging turfes out of the earth the whelpes do play the calues leap and briefly all the rest each one by a certain signe shewes that his mindlesse nature propends to pleasure but man thats borne

to knowledge beginnes to weepe before he hath leaue to eate that he may so learne that which was the first should be the frequentsts action of his life so mirth is theirs and mourning ours
now of those beasts very few and seldome times in seeming sorrow are seene a straying from their kind and if any yet those for men as we haue heard of horses and dogges that with their teares haue celebrated their maisters funerals but of men how many to brutish lusts haue quite giuen euer themselues ignorant or vnmindfull of their owne condition or their end for where is the

end of their pleasant springs but in saltnesse of the seas for the riuers haue sweet waters and the sea bitter as pleasure also ends in loathsomenesse and to say with salomon the end of mirth is heauinesse
howeuer

vncessantly the appetite comes and goes increaseth and decreaseth and riuerlike followes the trace of her inclination vntill her desire be satisfied and in her crooked courses following each first declining path of pleasure passeth as by a certaine race from place to place after steepe downe fall into the vallyes scarce euer reasce~ds vnto the lofty mountaines which neither the water

can nor appetite is wont yet still it runnes and ouerrunnes and againe returnes vnto the first whence the preacher saith vnto the place from whence the riuers come thither they returne againe
for from fleshly appetite so many flouds proceed so many and so endlesse lusts arise
the place fro whence these streames gush out is the well of naturall necessitie in which they end the ditch of vnnaturall satietie the way by which they passe is the quagmire of voluptuousnesse by which it returnes and runnes amaine the parching path of concupiscence
and as all decursion of waters is by visible

channels on this furface of the earth but returnes by vnderground and inuisible so lust by visible action and satisfying the desire eft soone is expelled but by secret operatio of the vegetable faculty reflects so repaires her restlesse motion

how miserable pray and how lamentable euer to whirle about neuer to get out this eddie now sinking then fleeting but neuer intermitting how to be desired rather to be detested are those oblectations of our desires which both are gendred of defect and turned into loathing wherefore as we can let vs gainestand and rid vs as we are able be we not so

carried of the sweete streames as to end our voyage in the saltest waues
here rather let vs admixe yea preferre some bitternesse admixe because when god bestowed all good without any composition of euill to be vsed and forbad to taste of the bitter fruite yet we ingorged our selues with euill strict iustice required that euill alone our portion after should haue bene yet hath the creators exceeding clemency euen hitherto vouchsafed vs some portion of that despised sweet but so that for memories sake and thankfulnesse he requires some of our myrrbe and aloes to

be mingled
this is surely that sweet sowre most toothsome and wholesome for the present time
let vs preferre it that is foretaste it eating our teares before our daily bread vnlesse this also we take to be the subiect of our prayer when we request giue vs this day our daily bread deserue not to dine not hauing wept before nor to sit at supper before haue wet my cheekes which as vnmeet so how vnsafe lazarus and the gluttons

storie doth declare and reason proues
for being there is a twofold world and in them either twofold both ioy and sorrow is considered and that without all doubt

both contraries must be tasted for god hath set the one ouer against the other

blessed sure is he who in things truly good treasures vp his portion of pleasure for the future life but swallowes before death his portion of the bitter cup so the wise man

orders them saying first a time to weepe then after a time to laugh
therefore weepe in time that both more surely and more abundantly we may triumph in all eternitie

ob&seruatio
whence elegantly father augustine gathers

it is that thirsting for the well of life he tearmes his teares not drinke

which more greedily is desired and easily

deuoured but bread that is harder and more difficult that is harsher and not so pleasant
remember indeed he said sometimes god gaue him teares to drinke and elsewhere that he himselfe mingled his drink with weeping but neuer that euer he vsed them for his drinke lest for themselues he should seeme to desire them as that well for what pleasure he hath in them is for necessitie of the end nor for themselues

amplificatio therefore neither he saith that alwaies he did eate that bread but when it is said vnto him where is thy god for else as saint basil

notes there remained no

time for that ioy vnspeakable and glorious of the elect and iustified allowed him of god no place for the apostles precept reioyce in the lord alway
for if sorrow be simply good then euer to be desired and so neuer shall be obtained that wherewith he doth exalt vs to the fellowship of angels perpetuall gladnesse who are accounted worthy to stand by the tribunall of the almightie
and

besides too much sadnesse becomes a cause of sinne in so much as sorrow ouerwhelmes the mind and by want of aduice occasions giddinesse by forgetfulnesse begets vnthankfulnesse
this fitteth

that which the hebrewes say the holy spirit in them that are euer sad makes no residence and experience too plainly proueth it in excessiue griefe

application
suppose therefore saint augustine

and saint basil

and his brother of nyssa would not commend but reprehend not onely the anabaptisticall sect which romanists themselues condemne as supposing the godhead is appeased by rude screeches or vgly howlings but also those selfesame romanists in some of their esteemed religious orders and such other like perhaps amongst our selues not vnlike as writes that learned father

vnto the tender worthlesse trees in which the wormes most easily are bred whom god also himselfe by esay

sharply reproues and plainly conuinceth as ignorant of the godhead

wherefore we are instructed that as they whose eyes are weake fearing to dazell them with continuall sight of the lightest bodies at times refresh them with more tollerable colours of flowers and hearbs so must the mind not alwaies be giuen to sorrow and sadnesse but turne her eyes to the speculation of better things

and exercise of good workes which pietie is much to be preferred

if separation of these were allowed before the bodily exercise of votiue teares which we in the persons of the women that embalmed our sauiour and of the apostles which bare his markes

and labouring in his vineyard rendered him the fruites in their seasons
the golden rauennas

elegantly compares in this wise woman the cause of euill the author of sinne the way of death the graues gate the inscription of hell the whole necessitie of lamenting for which they are borne in teares are subject to sorrow addicted to sighing and are so strong in teares as they are voyd of strength and so much as they are more vnfit

for labour so much the readier to lament therefore with their teares they vanquish weapons sway whole kingdomes with their weeping and by bewailing breake all the courage of the nobler sexe
its no wonder therefore if women be more earnest then apostles at teares at funerals at sepulchers at bodily obsequies about our lord his corps where woman first runnes to teares that first ran to ruine she is first at the graue which was first in death becomes the messenger of resurrection that was deaths herald and she that brought to man newes of so great destruction euen she to men presents the tidings of so great saluation that by

the hearing of faith she may repay what by counsell of misbeliefe she had taken away
this order is not preposterous but mysticall apostles are not postposed to women but reserued for workes of more honour and greater moment
women vndertake the handling of christ his bodie the apostles his sufferings they carry spices but these stripes they enter the tombe these the prison they take hold of graue clothes these of chains they powre in oile these out their bloud they are amazed at death these vndergo deaths and not to mention many things they sit at home these in fronts of battels stand that deuout like souldiers they may in dangers proue their

faithfulnesse strength in labours in wrongs patience in perils death suffering in wounds in paines deuotion constancie in renting of their bowels
to christ therefore the women are portitors of teares the apostles subduing satan and all other enemies report with victorie both triumphs and trophees vnto christ
like iudgement therefore must be held of them that by profession and emploiment succeed the women and apostles
for as the worke so is the reward and whose is the one to him by right redounds the other both in this present time and in the world to come

which euen here from

ob&seruatio
dauid may be gathered who saith my teares haue bene my bread or bread for me
confirmation this is that reference whereof we spake implying how euer the saints lament in holinesse the fruite is theirs
as in another place humbled my soule with fasting and my prayer returned into mine owne bosom
and yt wc the lord said to rahel that is to israel in ieremie doth confirm it saying refraine thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from teares for thy worke shall be rewarded
for the lord vpholdeth all that fall and raiseth vp all those that are bowed downe that is refresheth euery one and rewardeth that is afflicted for his

name that as the sufferings of christ abound in them so their consolations may abound by christ
v&se
this is the difference of those teares which are shed for god or godly teares and those of our hearts inuention yea and such as are of gods precept yet without their right intention as the answer of god to his people in babylon by zachary declares
their question is should weepe in the fifth moneth separating my selfe as haue done these so many yeares his answer is when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth which was their institution and seuenth moneth which was immediatly commanded euen those

seuentie yeares did ye at all fast to me euen to me and as if they had said then wherein haue we missed it is added should ye not heare the words which the lord hath cried by the former prophets and as if yet further it were demanded which are those words for the one fasting and weeping is enioyned and the other not forbidden it is replied a little after thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying execute true iugement and shew mercie and compassions euery man to his brother and oppresse not the widow nor fatherlesse the stranger nor the poore and let none of you imagine against his brother in your

heart
as if he had shortly said the purpose of mourning as well as sacrificing is mercie and the knowledge of god

for esay proues the one

as hosea doth the other
these are the teares that god vouchsafeth to see

these are they that are contained in his bottle and written in his booke

that my portion then may be with them to who it is said uerily verily say vnto you that ye shall weepe and lament but the world shall reioyce and ye shall be sorrowfull but your sorrow shall be turned into ioy so shall not feare to stand with them from whose eyes god shall wipe all teares
peter at first in semblance of

a carnall man said thou shalt neuer wash my feet but after seeing the danger representing the inordinately zealous and il aduised professor saith lord not my feete onely but also my hands and my head
he offended in the last but the greater danger was in the first
will wish therefore as touching teares may keepe the meane neither wanting nor yet superfluously shedding them yet rather then for want should heare thou hast no part in me pray they may so wash my soles that by so glorious a father and a tender mother they may be wiped from mine eyes
but we poore sinners how

should we be conceiued to exceed whereas the righteous dauid surceasseth neither day nor night

ob&seruatio
by which both day and night of many things we are taught
for first if night and day be taken for all time which by them is measured it shewes the saints powre out their spirits not lightly or for an houre and so haue done but constantly and seriously so long as cause remaines
so baruch in ieremie faints in his sighing and findes no rest
so that same prophet in his booke of wailings counsels the daughter of his people saying wall of the daughter of sion let teares run downe

like a riuer day and night

giue thy selfe no rest let not the apple of thine eye ceasse
the same is iobs assertion are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in their prouocation

amplificatio neither will they or can they otherwise chuse or do whom god himself commands and compels thereunto they will not because of his charge who thus hath charged the prophet thou shalt say this word vnto them let mine eyes runne downe with teares night and day and let them not ceasse
they cannot because of the smart of his rod

who say day and night thy hand was heauy vpon me

a wonderfull drinesse of the grape ensued the pressing of that heauie hand my moisture is turned into the drought of sommer
like to this is that of another why is my paine perpetuall and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed wilt thou speaking to god be altogether vnto me as a lier and as waters that faile

application
much differing in nature is their weeping in the temple which by they are gone ouer the threshold profuse laughter followeth after which by day to men do mourne not by night to god as do his holy ones saying with my soule haue desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will

seeke thee early but these like are their teares to northerne showers in sommers drought which moisten the boughes blade but neuer nourish the root of trees or herbes so it neuer fructifies

but to the purpose let vs remember the sable and silent night affoording conuenient solitude of all is tears best fitting nurse
the certain conuenience of solitarinesse ieremie a man next to dauid delighted in this exercise declares by his example my soule saith he shall weepe in secret places for your pride
and briefly for the night most deuout dauid witnesseth himselfe all the night long

make my bed to swimme water my couch with my teares of whom saith augustine this meate which is called bread men eate by day and sleepe by night but this so sauourie is and he so pious that no time he ceasseth

moreouer the same father well obserues

that if you take the day for the prosperity of this life and night for the worlds aduersity the conclusion will be the same for saith dauid whether in prosperitie of the world shed the teares of my desires the longing of my desires leaue not off
and how euer the world be well am still ill vntill appeare before my god
amplificatio
for no lesse if not so much more

the prosperitie of this world is to be lamented then aduersity for that more corrupts vs that this more easily may breake vs fallen they haue often in prosperity that haue not started in aduersity

application
yea and if we will consider whence are the adulterous fashions of this age from aduersity from trouble and danger nay for it gaue martyrs a race most generous most acceptable to god their father but these our times of peace and plenty a broode of vipers a seede of sinners a generation of wantons men effeminated women against nature in mens habite each leauing themselues

emulating either nothing but the others vices
prosperity flowing and failing temporall and mortall fleeing and falling hauing euer more deceit then delight
so much to be feared and worthy to be lamented as thou art able to entice and ready to kill the intangled as cunning to do the one as the spirit

that seduced ahab and willing to execute the other as the ghost that met brutus in the battell at philippi

a third collection seemes hence for to arise

that namely the saints lamenting for sinne surpasses the vngodlies wantonnesse therein for he weepes both day and night but their

blasphemie which did occasion it is after said in action but to endure by day
esau had shortly resolued to slay his brother iacob but rebekah his mother supposeth his fury after a few dayes will turne away

and though perhaps the euill intention was not changed long after nor euer repented of yet the scripture saith whe esaw saw that isaac had blessed iacob sent him away to padan aram to take him a wife from thence he also diuerted the streame of his thoughts from murther to another marriage but after a little we heare of iacob though not watching yet troubled by

dreames in the

night and fearefull awaking out of sleepe
yea many yeares after returning

to his country the feare of his brothers rage distressed him and not onely by presents and perswasions in the day time labours to mitigate himselfe but all the night vntill the break of day wrestles with god that he may preuaile with man

so abraham deuides himselfe he and his seruants by night pursuing them that by day had taken away his brothers sonne

so moses often whole dayes and nights and weekes yea almost moneths fasts and prays to god for remission of those sinnes which israel committed

at once
so in resemblance dauid in much distresse is following to recouer what vniustly is taken away while amalecke triumphing in their euill are eating and drinking and dancing because of the spoile that they haue taken so he expresseth that while his enemies reproach him all the day he watcheth which is more conuenient for night then day and is as a sparrow alone vpon the house top and in the person

of our lord he thus expresses my god cry in the day time but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silent
which we know how by our lord himselfe it was fulfilled oft times in the

garden

in the mount

and in the desert
so that howsoeuer the pharisees sometime by night conspire against him yet could they not be so watchfull to the euill as he for good

so paul and sylas

at midnight in prison pray and sing prayses vnto god while they that imprisoned them are asleepe
so do those many deuout in the house of marie the mother of iohn during the churches persecution and peters imprisonment for whom prayer was made of the church vnto god
so the religious ruler nehemie with fasting prayes both day and night for the euill that

had happened vnto ierusalem and iuda being already done and ended

so darius howeuer a heathen king yet partaking with afflictions of daniel seruant of the most high god when as the trecherous presidents hauing accomplished their diligent search

and hauing performed as they supposed the mischeuous deuices which they had imagined now sleep their sleepe

went to his palace and passed the night fasting nei+ther were instruments of musicke according to his vsuall manner brought before him and his sleepe went from him
yea and the king arose very early in the morning went in haste vnto the

den of lions and when he came to the den cryed with a lamentable voyce vnto daniel
so powerfull is the affection that hath but affinitie with religion much more true religion where it is by all indeuour striues to outstrippe naughtinesse
for them after their malignant counsels and cruell accomplishments pleasures drowne and sleep enterres but these silly lambes and mourning doues feare and care still solicites especially because they much disdaine to see good ouercome of euill
let bloudy persecutors this also vnderstand that if to feed on others flesh be their delight they may haue their pleasure also

in the night for herein its not amisse to imitate the noble spirit of that most religious lawrence

who on his bid the persecutor turne his carkasse and eate that which was alreadie roasted

but as for vs remember we by day to conflict with the works of iniquitie and by night imploring the heauens helpe get new prouision for each dayes fight according to the examples of our lord now related and of paul seruing the lord with all humility of mind and with many teares and temptations which befell him by the lying in wait of the iewes ceassed not from those teares

night nor day for three yeares while he was in asia that according to ours and their figure in israel and ægyptians the more by them we are afflicted the more our seed may multiply

and grow not onely by number of the faithfull as hath euer fared in the hottest persecutions

but also that each of vs our selues

being so by them excited become more feruent in euery good word and worke as of the holy apostles it is written that after many threatnings and beatings and imprisonments daily in the temple in euery house they ceassed not to teach and preach iesus christ for teaching and preaching of

whom they were so persecuted
so shall satans persecutions vnto the grace of christ proue but as water cast on burning oyle
so shall our religion by the fruites approue it selfe being both feruent and frequent which things by termes of night and day in meditation of gods law

in fasts and prayers to god

his most immediate seruices are vsually commended

so doing we may with ioy expect that day without all night which shall once clothe vs with the garment of perpetual gladnesse when they also that now abuse the vseful cha~ge of night and day shall be

oppressed with an euerlasting night
for this is the difference of this present and the change that is looked for now during the time of patience the visible course of night and day is common to the elect and reprobate but then all night shall be the ones and constant day the others lot
euen that day whereof the prophet speakes and it shall be one day which shall be knowne to the lord
that day whereof in one the whole church may say when shall arise and the night be gone and am full of tossings to and fro vntil the dawning of the day
that whose dawning the psalmist looketh for saying

the vpright shall haue dominion ouer them in the morning

that in difference whereof dauid may seeme now to say his teares are his meate day and night
for when he shall come vnto the place of which it is said there shall be no night there he shall no more eate the bread of teares but drinke without let without loathing without ending of that pure lifespringing well so earnestly so vncessantly here desired

from the particular maner and determined measure of whose desires and diet of teares as they are bounded in these words at length we come to more

ample and absolute consideration of that grace for the good as we are able of as many as hauing or seeking this gift of religious teares indeed account them gracious
for which intendment these heads seeme profitable to be handled first the nature

then the necessitie after the vse next the efficacie fifth the lets sixth the helpes seuenth the matter occasions or diuision of godly teares and last of their dignitie by way of conclusion to the rest

as for the nature

thus briefly may they be defined teares are in man a humour of thicke vapours by force of some strong affectio

gathered first about the heart then from it being straitned sent vp into the braine there by the coldnesse thereof resolued into water thence distilling into spongious glanduls of the eyes out of which at length they are wrung by the straining of those arteries which are deriued from the heart and head
now a little of each of these parts in particular

explication
and first we say they are in man or something to man belonging because the knowledge of the obiect is required for expressing of this outward signe
now amongst the bodily liuing creatures man alone is capable of knowledge

for whereas there are in man two passions principall to wit ioy and heauinesse arising both from knowledge of the cause to either of which all other may be referred the mighty god hath assigned to either in man a signe expressiue of it selfe namely teares and laughter
so that those teares mentioned of crocodiles and pallas his horse and certain dogs and birds happening to some of them ordinarily are to be accounted teares not properly but analogicall that is like vnto teares or if out of order then to so be taken as balaams asse her speaking

that they are a humour

sense seeing them distill witnesseth her selfe the which most rightly is therunto by god applied for the flowing of that liquid thing betokens the inward melting of the soule whereto suppose well may be referred that which dauid saith my sore ranne in the night

which cannot be a bodily sore because the originall expresseth it in the hands name

the matter of this humour seemes most to be those vapours in that it is neither bloud nor flegme choler nor melancholy nor yet appeares to be any of those which physitians call secundary humours though one hath said they are the

soules sweate
truth it is sweate like vnto teares is salt but not so cleare nor in such sort passing through the inward parts
neither is it easie to perceiue how excrements of the third concoction which is wrought in the outward parts of the bodie should be the nearest messengers of inward affections
as for that of nyssen to this purpose saying

that teares are drops of bloud· gushing out of the hearts wounds take to be more rhetorically then materially spoken

for fourthly that they are a corporeall effect of a mentall affection no man doubteth of fained teares

speake not which are but equiuocally so called therfore according to change of affection they are stird stilled raised and layed

now if you aske what affection they betoke the answer of some wil be that properly they witnesse sorrow but ioy by accident namely as ioy is accompanied with remembrance of sorrow but in mine opinion howeuer esteeme all the affections so to remaine commixed in the mind of mortall man as all the elements in that compound bodie wherein one onely is predominant yet should not that slight memorie of euill be in ioy so forcible as to produce

mourning teares
for sure it is that as either of two contraries preuailes the other in power is abated
wherefore the weaker remembrance of sorrow in the midst of ioy should not so effectually moue tears as that remembrance which in a middle estate is stronger because then lesse resisted neither doth experience at all times when most reioycingly we weep witnesse any thing lesse then that we remember sadnesse yea so much the more abundantly as we reioyce in singing the praises of our redeemer so much more without restraint without obseruance these waters spring out of their

fountaines wherefore we must acknowledge with the orator nature hath giuen teares messengers of the mind which burst out in grief and in mirth more pleasantly proceed
while as the one pressing straines them out the other dilating opens the passages that they may flow more freely both stirre the inwards with a stronger motion as also do desire of reuenge and affection of pitifulnes
whereby also may be perceiued why in the definition we required a strong affection
for neither a slow affection sufficeth to moue those vapours and the ouerviolent ouerwhelms or else ratifying dries them vp that infants

womanly creatures of either sexe

are lightly moued to weepe is caused either by the mind in that through defect of iudgement things oft times of little moment they repute the greatest or else proceeds from a qualitie of their bodies to wit the abundance of vapours in those whose constitution is of cold and moist

meane while those vapours gathering from each part vpon some great and vnaccustomed agitation of the mind about the seate of life for defence thereof compassing on all sides about do straiten it binding more hardly in sorrow and are therfore more strongly

repelled in ioy more gently compassing and therefore are more easily dispatcht vnto the braine
for betweene the heart and head there is a mutuall and rare compassion euen as betweene vnderstanding and affection
so that as the braine vpon knowledge of the matter giues notice and stirres vp the heart so the heart moued by the affections sends for her selfe her messengers circumfluous vapours to seeke the redresse of euill or increase of good

the braine then either by his coldnesse condenses those vapours into fluide humours as the middle and coldest region of the aire

those that breath out of the earth and water or those hote halations being in abundance vpward against the solide cauities of the braine by their repercussion and concourse are thickned as the drops hanging vpon the lower side of the couer of a boyling pot may by example teach

wherefore it is no wonder if what way they can readiest they fall into those spunges obserued by the eyes for in those that are humide at the same time they weepe you shall obserue that humour falling into their nostrils hauing found no receptacle in the soliditie of the head

like as it hapneth in those stils which they call retorts

finally it were not well prouided for the eyes if the waters receiued into those spunges were not thence wrong out which easily the head and heart by ministerie of their arteryes effect but in the eyes principally and lastly they appeare because the eyes first and chiefly harbour sinne and of the eyes of mankind especially of the womans that before man was in the transgression

thus of the nature of teares

followeth their necessitie which is either from the present consistence of our nature or fro

the institution of gods commandement or finally from condition of the end

from the consistence said of our nature not of nature vniuersally though plutarch being reproued

for weeping for his childs death not vnaptly answered thus nature flowes
againe of our present consistence not of our primary constitution for made we were without them and without sorrow the frequentsts cause thereof but now are borne of sinne in sorrow vnto labour

of sin that is of seed infected both with the guilt of the first sin and with corruption of originall errour

for who can bring a cleane thing out of an vncleane

and dauid acknowledgeth behold was shapen in iniquity and in sinne did my mother conceiue me
no lesse the himselfe hath taught inioyning the chastest and holiest mothers purification and sacrifice vpon their conceiuing and bearing children

in sorrow we are borne in respect of causes both procuring and effecting the procuring causes are either the losse of good things or the hold that euill hath taken on vs
the first good we haue lost is our owne integritie both of essence and ability of essence whereby at first by

connaturall and vncounterfaited righteousnesse we were confusion to the apostate angels but now by dolefull alteration we are a shame vnto our selues not with rebellious spirits onely but with the vilest insensitiue creatures being compared
ah how do those malicious supplanters insult and triumph ouer adams fall wherefore if thamar vnwillingly and therefore innocently

hauing lost virginity yet wept so bitterly and others rather then they would lose it haue depriued themselues of life most iust reason haue we that of originall glory our selues haue stript so wilfully

the losse of that other integrity which we call existence or ability is that totall corruption of our most pure and perfect nature so that of those things wherewith before it was both beautified strengthened and delighted almost nothing doth remaine but all contraryes in their places are come
let thine imagination propose vnto thee some body now faire and cleare and strong and nimble and by exactest symmetry of parts and colours lineaments proportioned anon exanguished some part blew with stripes other with wasting agues waxen pale a third through corrupted humors

ouerspread with vermine alcouered with vlcers with issues of matter loathsome to the eye and intollerable to smell through stinch not able to lift vp it selfe not to be approached for helpe of any other creature cast out forsaken and abhorred which sometime was in high esteeme amongst the best and honored
this euen this in respect of that which was is our present case

and yet a greater good we all by ods haue lost the king of heauen his fauour for how should the holy admit vncleane societie for thou art not a god that hath pleasure in wickednesse neither shall euill dwell

with thee the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity


none we iustly count more wretched then those who sometime haue bene kings delights but after euen to scullions are in derision whom ere while all men saluted all men coueting their presence bowed before them blessed them but now as knowne enemies of the common good they hate abhorre despise and execrate
vasthi thrust out of the kings bed hauing no place no not in the kitchin for making and adorning whose couch before all the precious things of the prouinces scarce sufficed yet those of late

her waiting mades allowe her not admittance into their presence
consider also haman

euen now the man without compare honored of the king and with the king alone admitted to the banquet of the queene yet by a sodaine turning of the wheele hoist on his gallowes of fiftie cubites prepared for his proposed enemie
these indeed scarce euer could enough be lamented by the subiects of these changes or their friends yet were not there condigue repentance to be remembred at the mention of those teares our fall deserued there a queene and here a courtier are cast out the fauour of a king but

whose breath was in his nostrels

but who himselfe within a moment might as another more powerfull after him be cast not onely out the kingdome but euen from all societie of men

into the place and forme and company of beasts but we by our demerit are expelled from the place and presence fellowship sonship of the euerlasting father the almighty god the vncorruptible vnchangeable king of kings and lord of lords

hereto adde of what priuiledges and benefits both bodily and ghostly our whole kindred is disfranchised for so when any is found in

obnoxious to princes is depriued not onely of fauour before enioyed but also of euery right and benefit euen to fire and water as the prouerbe is
and as touching our bodies whose foode before all but one the trees of eden were the fowles of heauen and beasts of earth and fish in the sea for seruice and whatsoeuer else the elements haue for holy sport and sinlesse recreation not one the least of these now they vse but for price or else by stealth
the lords his ransomed by price and that no lesse then the bloud of god the rest without right abuse them by iniurious robberie and shall

when the iudge sits receiue the recompence of their fellonie
as for the soule while the body vsed the creature the creator himselfe was her possession whose habitation from the beginning by the coeternall wisedome was with the sonnes of men
but now he is turned to be their enemie and doth fight against them
losse beyond all losse mischiefe likened by no dammage how many shall you heare relating vpon euery meeting their losse of some ship or goods a part or whole but of losing god no more then if they neuer had had interest in him of those losses so they speake as they that

seeme somewhat to themselues and would to others that sometimes they had such things to lose but this that as from themselues without all hope of once recouering for euer god as losse they do not once record
micaiah could bewaile the losse of idols how much more meet were it to lament the deniall of the true and onely god carelesse esau wept aloud with a great and exceeding bitter crie not quite for losing but for missing the chiefest place in his fathers blessing but we alas haue lost our father himselfe who can refraine from teares he for failing of a worldly preheminence

but we depriued of heauen and our father the maker of heauens yea and that other esteemes absurd to be demanded what he ailed the gods which saith himselfe he made being by violence taken

from him but how much more absurd is the wilfull abdication of god the former of all things not bewailed

finally with god against our will we haue left our natiue soile because against our selues we haue forsaken god therefore against our minds we depart our habitation
hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods saith the lord but my people haue

changed their glory for that which doth not profit
for the elected because beloued nation hath forsaken the true cleauing to them that are not
therefore their land cast them out because they had denied their god and vs all guiltie of like offence had paradise now for euer spued out because we had prouoked god if the clemency of the selfesame god had not succoured
it indeed mercifully relieues giuing hope of some returne yet we poore exiles iustly mourne in miserie during this our absence
our selues which haue the first fruits of the spirit euen we our selues groane within our selues waiting for

the adoption the redemption of our bodies

æneas and others long since expelled their countrie might carry with them their supposed gods whom they had not offended but we to whom was knowne and to worship granted the onely god omnipotent do sigh knowing our selues but strangers here and voide of god were it not for christ whom we haue prouoked
pleasant soile and fruitfull season and delightfull ayre of natiue paradise by fault of ours not thine from thee we sonnes of adam banisht are garden of god plantation of the highest with what teares shall bewaile not thy desolation

for thou art blessed not layd waste by the reiection of the corrupted sinner and sinne corrupting as also was the mother earth by washing off infecting flesh therefrom but sorrow for the vnhappie case of our whole race expelled from thy felicitie herefore the holy prophets esay and ieremie wash iazer sibma heshbon and elealeh with their teares
men of god who shall to me impart some part of your abundant wailing for the forraine moabitish land you all bewatered a country full of naughtines that you might so purge it but first that land most holy before my

comming by me defiled most pure by me polluted next mine owne fall deserued but most distressed casting thence that it might be cleansed
some

will haue vs to vnderstand from a certaine and much reuerenced translation that which is not vnlike that adam after his fall cast out of eden was placed ouer against in the sight thereof that by often beholding the sorrow of his sin might be increased
and no lesse surely suppose from the originall may be said of cain



the manqueller hated of the lord that there he not without gods ordination being separated from the face that is the

fauour of the almightie tooke vp his residence in the land of nod
woe is me that my habitation

also is prolonged in the land of nod whilest that for violating the highest maiestie expelled behold may but not enioy those pleasures once possessed
hardnesse of heart and emptinesse of head and drinesse of mine eyes who for all this hardly shed some teares remember that worthlesse multitude most like my selfe come out of ægypt a forreine and to them vnfriendly land

to haue wept most bitterly within few dayes after departure remembring the melonsz and onions cucumers leekes

and wheron they had fedde before though without all loue yea with extreame hatred of the inhabitants and wearisome labour brought low but absent now hundreds and thousands of yeares from that most naturall fruitfull and delightfull and friendly country seldome and slightly sigh for it
call not to my iudgment the inhabitants of

ziklag who wept for the supposed losse of their wiues children till they could no more they had lost their stuffe but their land remained their wiues were gone and their children taken but without difficultie they might contract new

marriages with women of their owne families by which their decayed expectatio of posterity might be yet repaired but to vs both house and land gold and siluer and most precious iewels and most familiar fellowship of the holy angels neuer on earth as before to be recouered was lost in a moment
againe thinke of this same dauid at that time almost stoned as the cause thereof at another time constrained to leaue ierusalem for a season yet with hope of safe returne couering his head vncouering his feete though guarded with an armie of valiant men weeping as he went vp by the

ascent of the mount of oliues

and grieue that neuer enough reproue mine own stupiditie and sloth and dulnesse
let vs all set before our selues as one of the ancients

well aduiseth that adam thrust out the garden

kept out by cherubim and edge of flaming sword which turneth euery way to keepe the tree of life
obserue our wretched father with eue the mother of her husbands miserie sent out looking backe desiring but not daring to returne somewhile comming trembling wise soone by the lookes of the awfull angell terrified departing then accusing his wife imputing to her alone

the losse of all the plenty pleasure and ease of paradise her in silence that had abused her tongue with teares and sorrow alone her selfe condemning and him againe looking home reflecting rebukes vpon himselfe at lenght but late acknowledging his follie in too much facilitie to a woman
finally both at length farre remoued that now they may not breathe into that ayre wherein erewhile they had all hearts desire yet in sight confined within some territorie fro whence they may as from afarre looking be moued to thinke what land what lord what libertie what honours what friends and

riches by their owne vnrighteousnes they had lost and this esteeme in present to be the case of each of vs

thus farre now of the good things lost yet not of the euill ensued of the gifts whereof we are despoiled not of our punishments inflicted
which if could as easily as may truly and wofully expresse a day would not suffice briefly to relate them
in the soule for knowledge hath ignorance taken place for wisedome follie for righteousnesse iniquitie impiety for holinesse and in the bodie for foundnesse rottennesse for health sicknesse for strength feeblenesse

for swiftnesse stifnesse a liuing death for constant life a death beginning at our entry into the world passing along amidst the manifold changes of our few and euill dayes

perfected at length when we go off the stage but neuer ended except to them that are in christ
so that we are at first loathsome seed in the middle brittle clay at last wormes meate
cherish the flash neuer so much flesh it is and if you consider diligently what issues by the mouth and nose and other passages of the bodie you will confesse as a deuout

man said a viler dunghill you neuer saw
if you could relate in order all its miseries how

with sinnes it is laded wrapt in vices itching with concupiscence possessed of passions polluted with illusions euer prone to euill inclined to all naughtinesse you should discerne it full of confusion and all shamefulnesse
what is more worthy of teares if you consider the best condition of these present things and if you will foresee what after the grape once pressed affords no further liquor but with perpetuall drinesse as salt vnsaunrie after is condemned like so the flesh by deaths presse for euer is dried from all delight neither euer againe recouers strength or stomacke for former wantonnesse
heretruly me thinkes may assume

the prophets words the precious sonnes of sion comparable to fine gold how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers the worke of the hands of the potter and a little after her nazarites were purer then snow they were whiter then milke they were more ruddy in body then rubies their polishing was of saphir but what change their eir visage is blacker then a cole they are not knowne in the streets their skinne cleaueth to their bones it is withered it is become like a sticke

as for the princes fauour which once we had now to the tyranny of hellish fiends our kind is subiect
can the mind of man

with patience behold the seed of
adam miserably serue their lusts ægyptian bondage is a shaddow compared with this for they in bricke and stone in clay chaffe and stubble but those materiall but earthly and therefore either measurable and so tollerable or as that stoike

said extreame and so in short cutting the thred of life ending paine and doing disgrace away yet god so soone as his people came into the promised land commanded they should be circumcised doing the shame away that still remained saying this day haue rolled away the reproach of æygpt from off you wherefore

the name of the place is called gilgal rolling vnto this day
whereby may be coniectured what shame from satan they haue got who are taken captiue by him at his will


doth any of you with vnwatered cheekes behold his sonne or brother nephewe or neere friend caught out of your company fettered with chaines bound to the gallies wanting bread cruelly beaten by turkish vngodlinesse detained abused but if we could looke about vs and behold much more basely slauishly cruelly our brethren at the pleasure of vncleane spirits now as it were with cudgels beaten driuen vp the

dangerous hill of pride anon compelled ouer steepe rockes to cast themselues vpon sharpe pikes of many offences sometime them of high descent filling and emptying swine troughes with the prodigall in drunkennesse and gluttonie others with sampson in stead of horse or asses grinding in the mill of the fleshes vncleanenesse which all and thousands such slauish conditions this present age affords in filling of mens lusts then should we sure acknowledge necessity of teares
what is here not base laborious bitter shamefull and lamentable yet these things daily without

teares wish without laughter without puffing vp

as at the incestuous corinthian without reioycing in such things of nought we daily see

certainely if nothing else yet this it selfe to extort some teares from the eyes of a reasonable minde were
will not here record what sorrowes are come in place of the ioyes of paradise a cursed earth for the blessed garden thornes and brambles for the tree of life wearinesse for strength to labour poison in steed of foode rebellion of beasts against the obedience of all the creatures

will omit banishment in place of dwelling for

plenty scarcity and torments present to come which already partly on other occasions we haue touched and partly shall in better season speake after on better occasion
at this time this onely will say nature hath excellently instructed vs necessity of weeping bringeth forth into the light all mankind with lamentation

one zoroastres the babylonian natures a duersarie and witchcrafts author alone excepted whose laughing at his birth imported wickednesse of life surpassing all that man had yet inuented



the effecting causes of sorrow in our birth are the

renting of our mothers whom before we had burthened so farre nature witnessing our vipereous generation

because of sinne which we bring into the world
and the crushing of him that is borne to shew how iesus for our sinnes must needes be pressed as a cart which sheaues


finally to conclude the necessity of nature as man is borne of sinne in sorrow so vnto labour as the sparkes flie vpwards sore trauell hath god giuen to the best of the sonnes of men to be exercised therewith



the necessity from corruption of our nature another followes by vertue of

commandement to wit of god whom as our maker to obey is the first necessitie whose commandement on euery creature hath imposed ineuitable necessity of being and abiding according to most absolute decree

neither shall man be able to frustrate what he hath said

for either here we shall weepe willingly obeying his precept or after late indeed but yet the longer being compelled by execution of that word on vs either here we must in the inward light of the liuing or after in the vtter darkenesse of the dead
now gods commandement is contained both in the old testament and the new of

the old both in the lavv and the prophets in the law it is enioyned by feast appointed the tenth day of the seuenth moneth for afflicting of their soules

by a statute for euer according to the letter of the law

during the lawes continuance and according to equity of the matter when the law is abolished and this vnder penalty of the offenders cutting off from among the people
againe

it is implyed in the bondwoman

her iniunction to bewaile her father and her mother a full moneth that so she may be an israelite his wife that is that we who were strangers and sinners of the gentiles

might be presented

a chaste virgin vnto christ

so he hath commanded in the prophets ieremie

and ioel

for themselues and others

whose testimonies before mentioned we need not reade againe
he hath commanded in the gospell by himselfe and his apostles by himselfe

first to his owne disciples when he had before herein set himselfe for their example for what as necessary he doth commend

its all one as though it were commanded
next his counsell is vnto the daughters of ierusalem

for themselues to weepe and for their children
by the apostles

in iames he hath charged each one to weepe

and howle for his owne miseries

and in saint paul for others

last is necessity of the end and that twofold both escaping euill and obtaining good
the euill we shunne is double of sinne and punishment of sinne in present for as saith saint chrysostome compunction of the heart alone consumes and wasts all errour of the minde for our speech is not of fruitlesse teares and what euils soeuer it findes therein wipes out and blots them all away findes it there the flame of concupiscence as an ouerflowing riuer straight it kills and quenches them if it see a company of cares and worldly perturbations as with a whip

it driues them out and forbids them accesse to the chambers of the soule and as the dust standes not before the wind so no euill thought dwels in the mind where it abides

the other euil to be escaped by teares is sorrow and paine for sinne signified by teares themselues because where it is it causeth them by teares say to be wiped away but as bernard saith how shall they be wiped from those that haue them not

the good by teares to be obtained is of grace or glorie
the good of grace that is to say good works can no more without teares or somewhat answerable thereunto be had then

fruites without the waters
for all the iust are trees who being planted in the midst of the prese~t church shold bring forth those fruits that may remaine

but these grow not in vnwatered mountaines
there are as one saith well three sorts of waters that make or keepe vs fruitful first inciteme~ts of the scripture which by threats and promises stir vp good will in man then gifts of grace which of a naturall make a spirituall man teaching him for himselfe commendable care and prouidence and leading into all truth minister the fruitfulnes of good works last the showers of teares which moistening with their dew the veines of right intention

renew the roote that the tree may neuer die

the other good bestowed on them alone that weepe is that which for vnequalitie of our vulgar language with the original the learned interpreters in our lords words haue rendred comforted

which as the learned clemens of alexandria doth obserue

containes entirely a twofold benefit of consolation here where we are and intercession aboue where we would be
that consolatio dauid plainly in his owne person shewes vs to be the fruite of teares saying depart from me all ye workers of iniquitie

for the lord hath heard the voice of my

weeping that is hearing my prayers ioyned with teares he hath taken away my sin therefore depart from me ye sinners of whom once was but now know that fro your number am exempted because for my sins god hath giuen me teares which of him neuer are reiected
teares giue great confidence of our sinnes remission and likewise of christs intercession for vs whereto that of iohn may happily in another sense be drawne without offence if any man sinne we haue an aduocate with the father iesus christ the righteous
if any man sinne and who sinneth not but if any so sinne that is by teares before

the lord powring out his heart as sometime the bloud of beasts before the altar because of sinne he sacrifice himselfe then sure it is he hath an aduocate with the father iesus christ the righteous the sole oblation of whose bodie

doth expiate both his and sinnes of all the elect but who so in this wise sinneth not that is knowledgeth not himselfe to be a sinner or knowledging doth not as the apostle bids by the mercies of god thus present his bodie a liuing sacrifice holy acceptable vnto god the same hath no part in christs intercession
now to conclude necessitie with the nature most

conueniently

the lord of nature and god the giuer yea and rewarder of religious teares hath himselfe ordained that we in teares should come and liue and depart this world

necessitie indeed doth greatly of it selfe commend the subiect

yet profit and pleasure are the things whereby we are most perswaded
the pleasure or delight of teares

haue in fit place before declared as could the healthfull and manifold vse thereof shall therfore now succeed
for whether we respect our ghostly aduersaries

euen those that make the handwriting of gods or dinances to be against vs in figure of the

floud of egypt

they are ouerwhelmed

for thus the lord in esay speakes haue blotted out as a thicke cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sinnes

or if we regard our frie~ds or brethren in distresse fellows in tribulation are the afflicteds co~solatio
this doth the purpose of iobs friends shew how euer the effect answered not for they had made an appointment together to come to mourne with him and to comfort him that is to mourne with him that by others partaking the burden of his griefe his shoulders might be a little eased thereof

next adde we the vse thereof in respect of vs
for

first they are auailable for inward consolation insomuch as ioy fitly cometh after sorow like as after labour rest the hauen after uracke by sea securenesse is acceptable vnto all but most to him that hath liued in feare to all the light is pleasant but more delightfull to him that is come out of darknesse to haue passed from death to life doubles the benefite thereof
finally as more moderately so more healthfully ioyfully after teares we dilate the spleene with diuinely applauded laughter whereof it is written when the lord turned againe the captiuitie of sion we were like them that dreame then was our mouth filled with laughter and our

tongue with singing

another profit we haue by them is for testimonie yet to god meane not to men for whose testimonie good men are not much solicitous
for teares as speakes that pathetick doctor are witnesses of the spouse her loue to whom her beloueds absence is a floud of teares while as she seekes but findes him not she calls but he giues no answer nothing she delights to do but weepe
and for this purpose whatsoeuer is mournfull into her soule she heapes together
finally the allowance of this witnesse is testified by that differe~ce put by the lord himselfe

betwixt the pharisees banquet and the distressed sinners

teares

moreouer no lesse the flouds of teares lift vp the soule from the gulfes of worldly lusts

then the deluge of waters the churches arke
for hanna the religious mother of holy samuel after weeping triumphantly being exalted makes her boast in god saying my heart reioyceth in the lord mine horne is exalted in the lord

in whom also as easily though in figure may be seene that plentie of fruites follow the showers of teares for she before barren hath borne now seuen

and yet this while in letter we heare but one vnlesse that one because of

worth be equalled vnto seuen as by the heathen one plato to a thousand
hereby that theoreme of nature appeares also to hold in grace

that the raine from heauen is more fruitfull then those that fro the lower wels are deuided vnto the lands that is the churches teares are more abundant in good workes then all inferiour ordinances and motiues of earthly commonwealths

after these is still our benefit but in respect of god a most conuenient way of seeking him
for this by the prophet himselfe doth promise shewing the israelites of god

and iewes in spirit

their accesse

in the time of grace in those dayes and at that time saith the lord the children of israel shall come they and the children of iudah together going and weeping they shall go and seeke the lord their god

but what were it to seek if we should not find the next is therefore that by weeping in constant seeking christ with his angels is seene himself which by another example that serious penitent marie magdalen after all other both men and women persisting in seeking him who she found not where she saw him layed as the holy euangelist saint iohn records in these words then

the disciples went againe vnto their owne home but marie namely she that first visited the sepulcher in the morning

and after returned with the apostles stood without at the sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stouped downe and looked into the sepulcher and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head the other at the feete where iesus had layen
and after a little she turned her selfe backe and saw iesus standing
when her soule in mourning was no lesse then her body bowed downe vnto the dust

then sees she him standing that is the conquerer of death who lately euen dead she had beheld laid in dust

the last profit of mourning

and if it be lawfull so to speake the first is gods namely by deliuery of the distressed out of trouble for boldly yet not vntruly faith that father once and often already named thinke you our god shall haue his entire and glorious praise vntill they come who shall in presence of the angels sing make vs glad according to the dayes wherein thou hast afflicted vs and the yeares wherein we haue seene euill from whose praise if they be wanting who may say we went thorough fire and thorough water but thou broughtest vs into a wealthy place
will adde if they be wanting from whose eyes he may wipe all teares the tokens of their former sorrowes

in signe of changing mourning into perpetuall but most gracious mirth when esays words shall be fulfilled of them long expected long since vttered by him in this wise the ransomed of the lord shall returne and come to sion first in the church on earth but more magnificently in heauen with songs and euerlasting ioy vpon their heades they shall obtaine ioy and gladnesse and sorrow and sighing shall fly away

the prouerbe is he is able to accomplish all that mixes profit with his pleasure but our meaning is at this present to ioyne power to profitablenes
to speake therefore

of ye efficacie of teares which was fourth amongst the heads propounded to be treated touching them if you will call them showers or stormes from aboue they hinder the attempts of diuels which besiege the citie of god quenching all their canon shot for teares are th effects of faith whose vertue is to quench the enemies fierie darts

or if you tearine them cataractes or falls of water from the highest mountaines they presse and crush what e're lifts vp it selfe against god

of which perhaps a little after he here complaines

whence is truly said

a stubborne

horse is tamed by the whippe and a rebellious spirit by shedding teares

for riuers and brookes carrying with them what euer lyes in the way at length ouerwhelming the very walls and bays opposed vnto their violence hence that is to them asscribed which is neare vnlawfull to attribute to a creature that by the a man in wrestling preuailed with god
he had power ouer the angell and preuailed but how he wept and made supplication vnto him

or if we say they are pure waters of some siluer streame in which the letters otherwise vnlegible are

perceiued

for if the drooping soule ca~not declare her minde teares shall supply where the tongue is tyed
or if that which is intended by weight of arguments must be enforced teares are the weightiest words wherewith veturia vnarmed coriolanus her sonne now readie to batter the wals of rome
to antipater co~plaining grieuously to alexander of his mother he returned this answer knowest thou not antipater that one teare of a mother will blot an hundred iniurious letters

will you stile them bathes the hardest ice will speedily resolue being cast therein such as they say

was the heart of the first most sinfull and then most mournfull mary magdalen
for in these is a hote resoluing quality issuing from the mines not of blacke sulphure or the like but of the precious and celestiall gold of wisedome inspired by god

are they called noble wines and generous that makes men confident

and they giue great confidence towards god which in one of dauids words euidently appeares where to the almighty he dares to say hold not thy peace at my teares

what is hold not thy peace at my teares know saith he lord thou art a righteous iudge none

know can deliuer out of thine hand know thou wilt iudge the quicke and dead thou wilt strictly iudge the sonnes of men for euery idle word vpon euery secret though lightest thought know thou wilt come and call the nations from east to west to heauens from aboue and to the earth beneath that thou mayst iudge thy people
and to my selfe am conscious of manifold offences yet this also know that thou art mercifull
know that teares and troubled spirit are to thee most acceptable because these thou hast commanded and these are sacrifices wherewith thou art pleased therefore pray do not remember my sinnes and forget my teares for so

should not be able to stand but rather remember these forgetting those
so shall not feare to come into thy presence when the thrones of princes are cast downe and thou art set the ancient of dayes with garment white as snow and haire like vnto the purest wooll vpon thy throne a fierie flame with wheeles as burning fire from which the fierie streames shall issue and come forth from before thy face when thousand thousands shall minister vnto thee and ten thousand times ten thousand shall stand before thee when iudgement is set and the bookes are opened out of the which all dead shall be iudged according to the things written therein
then

shall be discouered the iniquities of vs all and mine amongst the rest but if for them my teares in thy presence shall appeare their accusations shall be void and their guilt vndone
therefore thus confidently request hold not thy peace at my teares

finally if by art you wil perfect nature and ranke them amongst those which stillers skill makes and cals strong waters

able to breake through that which hammers lightly do not burst for weeping hath some preheminence of praying which peter conuerted by his lords lookes taught others by his owne experience breaking forth in teares without request of

words for we see his teares but do not heare his voice we reade his weeping but no mention of his speaking
iustly indeed peter wept in silence because that which is bewailed is not wont to be excused and what cannot be defended yet may be washed away for teares can cleanse the offence which shame forbids vs to confesse so teares are carefull both of credit and saluation not ashamed to seeke and sure to obtaine in asking
teares say are silent and yet effectuall prayers they aske not pardon and yet obtaine it they make no plea but finde mercie
this difference there is the prayers of teares are more auailable then of words for speech in prayer perhaps

doth lie which teares cannot speech oft times doth not vnfold the whole businesse but alwayes teares declare the entire affection
therefore now peter vseth not speech wherewith he had sinned wherewith he had lyed wherewith he had denied the faith lest thereby he be not beleeued in confession which erewhile denying he had abused
therefore had he rather lament then pleade his cause and confesse with teares what he had denied in words
and yet see further what peter hath profited in teares he fell before he wept but after he is confirmed an apostle and he who before his teares proued a transgressor after of gods flocke is

made a pastor and receiues others for instruction that had not before guided well himselfe
the same also in that holy penitent is proued for we reade she wept but not ought she spake we reade not saith one what in words she vttered but what she did
for the kingdome of heauen is not obtained by words but by good workes
a rare miracle is to be seene in her washing with her teares the feete of iesus
for often we obserue the earth watered by the heauens but inuerting natures lawes we neuer heard the earth bewet the heauens and yet that here may be beheld if we conceiue the maker of heauen aboue the heauen

so great a good are teares

and yet how many euill lets thereof hardly shall one seuerally relate but their sources or head fountaines shall here be pointed at too strong each one alone for this same naughtinesse which if in one they do concurre they resist with more forciblenesse
them in this order we will digest first

speaking of the naturall then of those which occasion breeds
amongst those naturall dulnesse hath his place which being of those euils that are bred in man makes senslesse them in whom it rules which vice

by the skilfull in nature they pourtray in that fish

which for this purpose is called slothfulnesse

this creature casts poyson of temper extremely cold which when ouer weeles or lines or angle or speare it hath runne stupifies the strongest armes that holds any of these deluding all their fishing so whatsoeuer affection in man hath need for to be stirred by such heartlesse lazinesse is ouerwhelmed
whence dauid so often intreates of god he would quicken him after his iudgements in his lawes in his righteousnesse
and as one that had deuoured opium or some destroyer of the vitall heate lighten mine eyes lest that sleepe the sleepe of death
this is accompanied with another vice as hurtfull as it selfe namely the neglect of our owne saluation which hath dwelt in man since he cast away himselfe
now where the end is neglected what care is of the meane expected he that cares not for prosperitie what trouble will he vndergo for hauing it he that loathes not filthinesse it selfe will neuer for cleannesse danger his life by washing in the riuer
if any delight in botches and neither smels nor feeles contagious vlcers seldome will he endure for health to be lanced and seared and cut

like to this or the cause

of this is ignorance of god and of our selues
for he that neither knowes himself to be vnrighteous not that god doth hate reuenge iniquitie neither gods mercie nor his owne misery neither how shamefull is his present life nor how fearful estate remaines him in vaine shall you looke from such for teares and lamentation
hence all speech for this effect to most men is ridiculous and vaine
this time as wrote the most famous christian oratour we neither feele in our selues the piercing sorrowes nor admonish others but are like corpes fairely adorned with vestments outwardly but inwardly with

long consumption of grieuous sicknesse wasted or as the franticke who speaking and doing many shamefull things and dangerous are neither ashamed nor frayed awhit but rather glory seeming to them selues scunder and wiser then the best so we against health doing what euer we do not so much as account that health which we want
if the weakest disease stirre the strongest of our bodies strait physickes helpe we seeke and laitish as the prophet speakes gold out of the bag

but for this purpose siluer is too fine to be weighed in the ballance the soule is daily torne and wounded burnt and vtterly endangered and yet no care is had
the cause of all

is that all alike of this sicknes we are possessed
as where all without exception haue some one bodily griefe very want of thought consumes them all while no man ministers the healthful nor forbids the hurtfull things so we all languishing some more some lesse are one and other destitute of sense

obliuion is next and not vnlike
for know a man that himselfe not onely descrues wrath and hatred but also is adiudged to shame and paine yet if by interuention of other things he let the remembrance of those to slip it is all one as though he had neuer knowne
for vnremembrance of euill is falling

of sense out of the soule which lemuels mother intimates bidding giue strong drinke vnto him that is ready to perish and wine vnto those that be of heauie hearts that he may drinke and forget his pouertie and remember his misery no more
and familiar instance doth illustrate it when the eues and robbers arraigned and iudged ouer night to die the morrow by companie of their mates with tobacco and wine become so carelesse as if they were repriued from death for a thousand yeares
this we see and wonder at others forgetfulnesse and say if it were our case we should not

be vnmindfull of so certaine and so present death and yet our selues with like or other delights bewitched scarce euer thinke the like estate is ours
for since once it was in adam said to vs dust thou art and to dust thou shalt returne the sentence is past on euery of vs and with our sentence we are sent to prison shortly after to go to execution onely with this difference that they commonly betweene their doome and death haue from the earthly iudge the assured respite of a night but we from god the iudge of all haue not the certaintie of an houre

from these there springs another euill as hurtfull as

the rest for many pharises not discerning or not remembring their owne wretchednesse remit teares to publicans and harlots as not beseeming them or deserued of themselues let dauid and peter and marye and like trangressors weepe as for vs we are not tainted of any criminous offence

so sing they to their organe

and boasting of the babel which their owne conceites haue built glorying in their riches and increase of goods and neede of nothing not knowing that they are wretched and miserable and poore and blind and naked
such as once fell out of the castell windowes to the bottome of the deepe

though after exalted much higher then before in the house that stands vpon the rocke

they thinke had neede by reason of their former fall still to weepe

as for themselues yet swimming in the waters sometimes taking hold yet neuer entring into the house

that stands amidst the seas

they know no cause of forrowing as long as their head is aloft though suddaine waues may driue them once for euer out of sight

these of many hindrances we haue obserued in nature but if we giue good heed we shall find custome in number or power of euill will not be behind or

sinne cleauing to vs from without giue place to that which is bred within vs
where first much businesse offers it selfe the bane of all godlinesse which not onely possessing but also distracting the soule neuer lets it throughly intend the matter of saluation
this in martha her many things he implyes

who was not so much ignorant as vnexperienced of bodily imployments christ meane he that sweats much exhaling the matter as some thinke of teares leaues the lesse for them

as hurtfull as this is the company of others especially of such as are destitute of ioyfull heauinesse which

peter hath taught by his example

who being scarce gone out of the garden wherein flouds of teares did runne scarce turned his eyes from off the cheekes whereon the furrowes of their impression might be seene and entred amongst the multitude of the high priests houshold but straight fro the eyes of his mind are gone those teares whose salt sweeteneth as yet the worlds bitternesse

hereto be added two extreames contrary to themselues and to that vertue which opposes both namely ouermuch both ioy and heauinesse
for as saith saint gregorie

and experience shewes moderate affliction

produceth teares and excesse withdrawes them because griefe it selfe is voide of griefe which swallowing vp the afflicted mind takes away the sense of paine
this is it the apostle saith he feared in that corinthian

lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed vp with ouermuch sorrow

on the other side call excessiue ioy not by intention of the truth of it selfe but by supposition of the occasions falsehood when men against charitie reioyce in iniquitie

which how little semblance it holds with teares of godlinesse needs not so much as is easie to be shewed
they haue no

where lesse residence then in one heart together the one are from god the other of the world the one grieued at worldly things the other gladded the one is puffed vp with the possession of things transitory the other is straightened by defect of things eternall
finally it is vnfit the glutton enioy the daintyes of the holy begger neither can suit in any sort that iesabel and elias herod and iohn caiaphas and christ be partners in ioyes celestiall that are so farre fundred in the temporall

lastly he cannot lament his owne misery that striues indeed to resist his owne pernicious way but

yet is weakened by frequent motions of his fleshly desires arise he would but cannot he striues and promises his fealty to the one maister and performes it to the other reacheth to the one his hand to be lift vp meane while the other whispers him in secret the labour of rising and the ease of rest who seeing as he supposeth that rest is good

consents vnto it

the effect and end and summe and consummation of all these is induration hardnesse of heart not onely the let of this but also the bane of all other diuine graces no otherwise haile consumes the vine or blasting corne or

the greene herbe is eaten of the caterpiller then this wild beast makes hauocke of all that toucheth heauen soules health or god himselfe in whomsoeuer any of these beares rule because this leauen is in all those lumpes hardened they are in manner of a flint or as yce congealed of cold

whose hardnesse if possible with god our purpose is for to resolue for which end some helpes proferre respecting minde and memory

and action which together concurring may moue the affection the certaine fountaine of all cleere waters of this kind

to the vnderstanding

this pertaines to know this is the time of weeping and after laughing this of mourning that the time of dancing may succeed as speaks ye preacher present sadnesse is the mother of expected gladnes
besides

the comparison of things lost vnto these present implyes so much

before was neither death nor sicknesse nor these pernicious words mine and thine for as the sunne and tho ayre and which is most the word of god so then the earth and things therein were common but now alasse of property and possession of the basest elements is sprung the most vnsauourie roote of auarice besides the enuie in men of lowe estate with pride

and hatred in the higher and other plagues of mankind in stead of honour then equall to angels in stead of supercelestiall contemplation in stead of confidence to godward and partaking of diuine beatitude vnutterably by the expresse image glistering in the soule is come in place a swarme of wofull euils and perplexing calamities like as waspes
what mischiefe will you first bewaile the shortnesse of life and paine beginning in teares and ending or wretched infancie the dotage of old age the inconstancy of youth the labours of manhood or the burden of wedlocke the solitarinesse of single life in want of children decay of name and memory in hauing them

perplexed care of nursing teaching training vp endowing placing enriching them sometimes the sorrow of losing them the enuie of wealth the paines of pouerty passe by the various kinds of naturall diseases of outward dammages from men from beasts from diuels which euery man hath in possibility hauing them in condition of his nature
leaue we the furie of lustfull loue that stincking puddle with all that madnesse wherewith therefrom mans heart is filled the paine of coughing spitting and other eiections that we may not seeme to inueygh by reason against that life that is employed in making dung
this plainly is most worthy to be

lamented of euery prudent man that when this liuing shadow or shading life is gone then straitens vs the feare of iudgement and flame of fire which shall deuoure the aduersaries of god

it is another helpe to know the difficult entring that gate of heauen
if the multitude of israel so bitterly lamented and wailed so mournefully hearing but a misreport of hard entring their country canaan that lifting vp their voice and crying they wept all night

much more it behooueth vs that are taught both by our lord his sentence and our owne experience how strict that gate is

and the way narrow
this they neuer

feared till they came neare it they feared not because they knew it not but vpon some knowledge the conscience of their sins denying hope of gods presence in a moment fils their heart with feare so many carelesse in this wildernesse while being borne of gods prouidence as on eagles wings their garment is not worne nor the latchet of their shooe waxen old raging like fooles are confident but at deaths approach hearing with who they are to skirmish fearing the entry without true hope of help they begin to feare and murmure that euer they came neare the border of

gods inheritance and then they weepe in vaine who if they had wept in time should haue changed now the voyce of weeping vnto that of triumph
man how wilt thou be able without danger to passe through the ayre the region of contrary powers and principalities who here as in thy proper habitation art not able to one of their least assaults by sinne

as for the memory therein would perswade thee to haue euer three things especially what thou wert what thou art what thou shalt be stinking sperme a vessell of excrements and meate of wormes besides that

thou art borne in sinnes vncleannesse liuest in the filthynesse of vices and diest in the bitternesse of vngodly deedes
who shall giue to mine eyes a fountaine of teares that may bewaile the miserable entring of mans condition the culpable course of mans conuersation the damnable departure of his dissolution therefore with teares will consider whereof man is made what he doth and what shall be done with him formed is he of clay of dust of ashes of that which in a sort is yet more base of loathsome seed conceiued in itching of the flesh in heate of lust and stench of luxurie and which is worse in vncleannesse of iniquitie he is borne to feare to labour to

paine and that which is more miserable to death he doth wicked things wherewith he offends god his neighbour and himselfe shamefull things wherewith he polluteth his fame his person and his conscience vaine things whereby he neglecteth profitable necessarie and comely things
at length becomes the fuell of fire which euer flames and burnes vnquenchably the foode of a worme that euer and eates immortally a masse of rottennesse which euer smels and stinkes most horribly
these ought we with attentiue mind and present memorie alwaies meditate so to good purpose should the vnderstanding

wretched

in sense be more wretched then the ignorant knowing and remembring how to amplifie the causes of lamenting which the other either knowes not or forgets
amongst all these yet are our sinnes the cause of all the rest most worthy to be thought vpon and with their guilt and shame and filthy basenesse euer as a statue to be set before our eyes
would god mine were in secret before my sight as high broad as nebuchadnezers image set vp for worship in the plaine of dura

know not who now liuing hath lesse cause then dauid so to do whose sinne as saith himselfe was euer before

him

the other helpe of memory in this behalfe is the often remembrance of those that mourne in so much as we learne though not most rightly yet most easily by example which when in it selfe it cannot presently be had next is that by remembrance the damage of absence be supplyed
so ieremie by remembrance and considerance of the people of gods affliction prouokes himselfe to weepe what thing shall take to witnesse for thee what thing shall liken vnto thee daughter of ierusalem what shall equall to thee that may comfort thee virgine

daughter of sion for thy breach is great like the sea who can heale thee woe to them therfore that lye vpon their beds of iuorie and stretch themselues vpon their couches swimming in all the other waters of voluptuousnesse
but they are not grieued for the affliction of ioseph
vriah the hittito abhorred to go vnto his house sober or drunke though aduised by the king to eate and to drinke and to lye with his wife while the arke and israel and iuda abode in tents while ioab and the seruants of his earthly lord encamped in the open fields and shall not we proue degenerous israelites

if hearing how the tabernacles of edome and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarens how gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines also with the inhabitants of tyre and ashur ioyned with them haue consulted together with one consent and are confederate against the lord how the kings of the earth set themselues and the rulers take counsell together against the lord and against his anointed against the flocke of his pasture not saying now let vs breake their bands asunder and cast away their cords from vs which long since they haue not feared to do but now taking craftie counsell against his people and consulting against his hidden ones they haue said in whose person no lesse then of those nations the prophet may well seeme to haue spoken come and let vs cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in reme~brance
if we say while god hereby calls vs to weeping and to mourning

be so farre therefrom that we giue our selues to fleshly ioy and earthly gladnesse if when by supreme authority also vnder god in gods stead we are called to fasting a speciall helpe of healthfull contrition then we turne to killing of oxen and slaying sheepe how dwels the spirit of god in vs seeing our brethren stand in neede and yet shutting vp the bowels of our compassion from them
god perswade vs better things not in conceiting of our but by serious practise in vs
but thou god whose is the cause awake to visite all the heathen and be not mercifull to any malicious transgressors
remember this congregation which thou hast purchased of old the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount sion thy christian catholike church wherein thou hast dwelt euen during those dayes wherein christ in her was hid from the eyes of man lift vp thy feete vnto the perpetuall desolations

at least by their intention who say rase it rase it euen to the foundation thereof euen to all that the enemie the man of sinne these thousand yeares hath done wickedly in the sanctuary
remember lord that now long time right rauenously thine enemies haue roared in the midst of thy congregations these westerne churches they haue set vp their ensignes of papall keys and supposed shippe and triple crowne of primacy and vniuersality and many such for the signes of him that is set vp for an ensigne to the nations
a man sometime was famous according as he had lifted vp axes of sound speeches vpon

thicke trees of gentilisme and iudaisme

and diuers heresies

as did paul and barnabas paul and silas irenaeus cyprian arnobius and lactantius clemens and tertullian saint augustine and ierome with hundreds more transporting the goodly cedars and firres and palme trees for the building of the holy temple
but now they break downe the carued worke thereof at once with axes and hammers of prophane disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth they haue cast the fire the contentions of words into they sanctuary they haue defiled by casting downe long since the dwelling place of thy

name to the ground and now they haue said in their hearts let vs destroy them together but now lord awake arise at last

and render vnto our enemies seuenfold into their bosome the reproches wherewith they haue reproched the footsteeps of thine annointed so we thy people and sheepe of thy pasture will giue thee thanks for euer

the furtherers of teares in regard of action it selfe shall be considered in the substance and circumstances thereof of circumstances the manner is first that namely it be orderly either ascending from inferiour things or descending from the higher either from our

owne basenesse or from gods magnificence proceeding in order to the other which both in dauids hymnes it is easie to obserue and we by some resemblance may illustrate in two maries mentioned in the gospell
for mary magdalen began standing to wash iesus his feete with her teares

and after is said to wipe them with the haires of her head and to kisse and annoint them which could not be done without bowing of her selfe but another marie the sister of lazarus and martha we heare first she sate at the feete of iesus and heard his word

most like after arose because of the reuerence she gaue

vnto it for so was the ancient manner of hearing the law

and so long after the fathers sermons witnesse

they vsed in the easterne churches

the place to be chosen for this purpose had need to be most retired lest either the repinings of vngodlinesse hinder the fruit of holinesse or fauour of the religious peruert it to hypocrisie
hence our lord enioynes that those that pray betake them to their chambers and shut their doores praying to their father which is in secret and the effectually religious wishes that had wings like a doue for then would flee away and be at rest loe

then would wander farre off and remaine in the wildernesse
therefore also another prophet saith my soule shall weepe in secret places for your pride

for this purpose also serues the silence of the night when no colour by the eyes nor any noise by the cares or obiect of others sense disperses the intention of the mind
therefore the watches waite for the lord as witnesse the prophets both dauid and esaias if remember thee vpon my bed faith the one and meditate on thee in the night watches
againe preuented the dawning of the morning and cryed hoped in thy word· mine eyes preuent

the night watches that might meditate in thy word

and the other with my soule haue desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will seeke thee early so by another prophet the lord enioyneth the citie which he calleth to repentance arise cry out in the night in the beginning of the watches powre out thine heart like water before the face of the lord
for darknesse by its proper likenesse striking horror into the mind makes a commotion amongst the affections which as in the sea the moouing of the moone· causes an ouerflowing of the waters
therefore not onely watching of the

soule but also of the body is needfull as dauid saith watch

and our lord watch and pray

and paul watch thereunto

that is to prayer for which we require teares and chrysostome saith teares in stead of gemmes were the ornaments of dauids bed

as for the substance of this action whereof we speake for it is required the absence of some and presence of other things
the absence or more properly the omitting of emploiments so far as for this end is needfull
for thus the lord saith himselfe be still and know that am god
to this is that he doth command

not to plow with the

firstling of an oxe nor sheare the firstling of a sheepe which were holy to the lord in figure of our oblation by that kind of first fruites of his creatures

yea truly how contrary is too much of employment how good soeuer to spirituall contrition or reioycing the only springs of this we speake of experience too plainly proues

the things whose presence is required are many of which these are chiefe the author enioyning the cause effecting and the obiect procuring
the author speake of is god whose looking that is whose pitying is the first mouer as of euery other so of this

religious action
so peters teares baptize his sins for then saith rauennas peter

that is euery repenting sinner is wont to weep when the lord lookes vpon him

and the scripture saith the lord turned and looked vpon peter and peter remembred the word of the lord how he said vnto him before the cocke crow thou shalt deny me thrise and peter went out and wept bitterly
bitterly he wept that bitterly had cursed he wept bitterly resoluing the gall of bitternesse by the heate of the two great lights his lords eyes for it is written the king that sitteth in the throne of indgement scattereth away all euill with his

eyes

now the eyes of the lord are vpon the righteous
pray we therefore for that righteousnesse that vprightnesse of heart which the lords eyes may not disdaine to looke vpon especially when we stumble fall for who sinneth not

so may we indeed be cold but neuer so congealed or our fountaine dried but some of these waters from our eyes may slide

the nearest effectuall worker is that spirit that in the beginning moued vpon the waters

and moueth to the end what euer was formed of those waters that is of the vnformed matter so void as yet and yet so capable of any

forme as water
whether not absurdly by certaine maner of expounding that of the psalme is drawne he causeth his wind to blow and the waters flow

for spirit and winde in the noblest languages haue a languages haue a common name

as god enioynes and the spirit moues so fit obiect exceedingly prouokes the mind to mourning and the eye to weeping

it may be fitly compared to musterd or onions or other like which by naturall austeritie and tartnesse stirre the humours whence next to the imploring of gods furtherance and entertaining of the spirits motion we had need to frequent

those outward helpes that find such hardnesse in our selues

that obiect for distinctions sake let vs call presentatiue or subiectiue that subiectiue which may in its owne consisence be set before our outward eyes such as are others sufferings and what else by sight occasions sorow

such as was lazarus his tombe vnto his sisters

and christs to the other women
so the afflictions specially of the saints scarce is credible how easily they cause to weepe so many as with affection do behold them
for mans mind by nature is inclined to mercie vpon the sight of that which is

in miserie
whence rightly iohn chrysostome aduiseth each man to be his owne almner for they who commit vnto their seruants or burden their ministers with the distribution of their goods vnto the poore not onely depriue themselues of the recompence of that ministerie for it is one thing to empaire thy substance

another to officiate saint stephen and the holy deacons their office in distributing but also of the fruite of compassion and grace
for this may affirme of all godly christians ioyfully bearing their maisters crosse which hee spake of the true monks that is the retired solitary ones of that age

they are as lampes of light in quiet hauens in their cottages meane or couches or where euer they lye vnder the hand of god holding out as it were torches and in their owne abasement with blazes of heauenly light directing all those that daine for to approach them that they may not split on the rockes of pride or sinke in the shelfes of fleshly lusts and earthly desires
therefore it is the wise man saith it is better to go to the house of mourning then to go to the house of feasting
and again the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fooles is in the house of mirth
for as we laugh

with wantons so shall we weepe with the that weep hauing put on the bowels of pitie
the most certaine seates of teares saith he are monasteries but to touch this by the way not of begging friers
for euen there he saith they are such as cannot beg
neither were they rich and wealthy persons able to sustaine themselues and others of whom he speakes it is a great work and laudable to visite and consider the poore but of those that laboured with their hands working that which good is as the apostle requires of all christians and all writers of those times can giue witnesse to the ancient monasteries

that they sustained themselues and relieued others

this by the way
next helpe of this kind is that we call for those that skilfull are in mourning of whom we may learne our selues to weepe
for as it is a worke of charitìe to go our selues to those that mourne so it is a cause of spirituall profit to call for them who by their example can teach others this affection
thus god himselfe giues counsell in the prophet for thus saith the lord of hoasts consider ye and call for the mourning women that they may come and seeke for cunning women that they may come and let them make haste and take vp a

wailing for vs that our eyes may runne downe with teares and our gush out with waters
and a little after heare the word of the lord ye women and let your eares receiue the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and euery one her neighbour lamentation
in which words the prophet teacheth both that those women could by example teach to weepe and that others learned by their companie
they saith saint ierome there are wont in weeping with dolefull voice and striking their armes with their hands to prouoke the people to wailing
this custom saith he againe as yet remaines in iudea that the women

with haire about their eyes and maked breasts and voice tuned to that purpose prouoke all to weeping
and this as conceiue is the chiefe if not the only cause why the lord in solemne fasts assembles not onely elders and such as vnderstand but also bids gather the children and those that sucke the breasts yea and otherwhere enioynes the beasts their fast

not that the seruice of such vnsensible or vnreasonable creatures is pleasing vnto god who delighteth onely in our reasonable seruice but because by sight of such

those that are endued with actuall reason are the more themselues affected
now

if you aske who are these so skilful of lamentation as to teach others who else say but those that by the hand of god haue learned themselues those with whom god according to their measure deales after the maner of his onely son who was a man of sorrowes and acquainted with griefe
those who at length by constant exercise haue put on pauls affection saying who is weake and am not weake who is offended and burne not those that can say with dauid all the day long haue bene afflicted and chastened euery morning

the presentatiue obiect of teares is such as cannot in the present with bodily

eyes be seene but presented by the mind vnto her selfe this besides the miserie of our present case whereof before vnder the head of necessitie is of death or day of iudgment
that houre of death now imminent let neuer depart out of the spirits sight remember now man thou hast already attained the eleuenth houre of thy lifes day with what diligence thou hadst neede to bestirre thy selfe that at last thou mayest be found to haue wrought one houre in thy masters vineyard consider now what necessitie doth vrge to steere thy barke by gods direction for time of sayling is at an end tormes arise and tempests

come the winter is at hand and occasion calls hither sluggard shew what thou hast gained thy lord by trading all thy life alas what feare distracts the vnprepared at the time of death what dread the slothfull when body and soule must part to receiue first asunder some part of that they haue earned together what torment then takes hold of him who while time serued neglected the care of life my soule what then will be thy thoughts when nothing thou shalt be able to speake and most strict precept without reuersing delaying or appeale shall bid thee to go out when vertues worthies beholding the sweate of their labours

and fastings and watchings shall leape for ioy because the soule goes to her long desired and expected rest and the body to quiet sleepe in hope of resurrection
then must needes feare affright the carelesse seeing no good but their many euills meeting them and when they shall behold the terrible officers which in the bodies they haue obeyed ready to receiue their soules out of them then shall they fall and rise no more

after this will much auaile often remembrance of the dreadfull day of iudgement wherein the thoughts of all hearts shall be

disclosed

and whatsoeuer is hid shall be reuealed which now most part we do conceale not onely from others but euen from god if it were possible and from our owne hearts for as in the moneth of aprill both wholsome roots and poysonable discouer themselues which in the winter were not seene so then the priuate prayers and almes and fasts of all the elect before god and his angels shall be published to their praise and the secret villantes of all impenitent offenders shall as in the prophet be set on the top of a rocke lest they should bloud or waterlike sinke into the ground
for which purpose shall not be vnwilling

to relate what vppon the same occasion sometime a religious man vttered in his owne person
for comming out a certaine morning at the gates of edessa in syria beholding as he looked vp that cristalline heauen like some resplendent looking glasse with all the starres most glorious shining on the earth thus spoke how shall the saints shine in the glory of their father whose beauty is but figured by these but said he destitute of all commending vertues and adorning graces presenting to my mind the horrible appearance of that awfull iudge with thousands of his saints the splender of whom one alone is

able to dazell all sinfull eyes in body and mind affrighted and vtterly amazed thus admonishd my selfe how shall vniust transgressor appeare in that terrible time and dreadfull day how shall stand before the tribunall of the mighty iudge puffed vp and proud what place shall finde amongst the righteous haue liued a goate how can on the right hand be placed with the sheepe how shall a fruitelesse tree abide amongst the saints whose boughes their fruite sway downeward or when in the court of heauen the saints shall knowledge and take acquintance each of other who shall vonchsafe to speake to me vile wretch who with them heere haue

entertained no fellowship of sutable conuersation the martyrs shall present their wounds and torments and practitioners of religion the ensignes of their vertues what can present but spirituall pride and shame and sinne good were it that each of vs spent many our thoughts that wander we know not whither in this kind of questioning for sure the heart that herewith is exercised while it is so implyed shall neuer be hardened

if such thornes ofte prickedour eyes we should doubtlesse sometime bring forth teares

hereto adde hearty sighes and groanes of spirit which in our lords example

are teares forerunners most agreeable to iob dauids practise who weeping most frequently witnesse of themselues the one my sighing commeth before eate and the other by reason of the voyce of my groaning my bones cleane to my skinne
and experience teacheth that teares by these are stirred euen as the waues of the sea by winds
dauids psalmes also and such other dittyes with conuenient modulation

are able to digge vp wells of such pleasant waters for no outward thing more powerfully moues the affection then harmonye because as the learned say

man in all his parts is formed by exact proportion both heathen histories of hellene and alexander and many other do witnesse the power of moods affecting and inclining the mind according to their temper
and the scripture often exemplifyes it for singing men and singing women prouoke the peo+ple to lamentation ouer king losias most renowned for religion

and elisha will be stirred vp to prophecye by a minstrill

so saint athanasius

and especially saint augustine witnesse in their owne example and the learned fathers haue obserued
the whole body of diuinity is therefore

by the spirit of god written in verse

here is not to be omitted the reading of the scriptures
for if as the lord speaketh

his word he a hammer that breaketh the rocke in peeces then doubtlesse the waters shall gush out as by the rod of moses and as a fire so much more effectually it shall distill them as the power of god excels all chymicall art of man so onely reading be with attention

finally meditation of the workes of god especially of his mercyes that endure for euer

which makes oftentimes the saints with great admiration to exclame what is man that thou

art mindfull of him and the sonne of man that thou visitest him comparing his glory and grace and goodnesse with their own vile estate and vnthankfulnesse this is it that which dauid sings thou lord hast made me glad thorough thy worke will triumph in the workes of thy hands

for right vse of all these very helpfull is iohn chrysostomes aduice to draw backe and keepe backe from outward things euen the outward senses as farre as euer you can that so you may depart farre from the perturbations and fluctuations of all visible things breaking through into that inward silence where nothing interrupts

the search of thoughts we must exclude the images of outward things which into the soule as into a pump the senses carrie meane not quite shutting the senses or depriuing them of vse but turning their intentions vnto supernall things
like as some graue matrone and seuere mistresse being about to make some precious ointment awakes her maides and calls them her selfe and hauing shut her selfe and them within enioynes one to hold the scales that with due weight and measure each spice with other may be mixed knowing the compound will proue vnprofitable wherein due proportion is not kept another she sets to breake and bruise

the seuerall kinds lest any hardnesse or asperity should hinder the mixture she appointes a third which serues to separate the grosse and finer from one another
the fourths employment is to mixe all and make one masse she commands a fift to stand by with some boxe of alabaster or the like and so restraines the rest each one vnto her taske not suffering their senses any whither to stray abroad lest the intended worke should be hindred
thus plainly it behooueth euery one to do that will prepare this precious oyntment and grace of teares
admonition
being straitned here of time hastening to my more proper employment and place do but mention

three other places now coming to mind yet obserued by experience to giue great furtherance
first a containing euen of the body so much as may be in one place this seneca hath commended to his lucilius to be first preparatiue for his morall wisedome and others shall find if serious purpose make vse of it it is as needfull so very helpeful to deuotion
the other is fasting and the third silence so vsefull that he who hath not learned to charge himselfe therewith hath scarce from a farre saluted the most retired inward and spirituall workes of religion
the ancient christians write of these at

large specially of the two last from them if leasure had serued would haue borrowed what should haue found best fitting our present subiect but must for this time remit the learneder to the authors them selues and pray the vnlearned to accept with patience what god hath enabled me to do for the present

diui&sion
now for methods sake shall follow the diuision of teares into their kinds which by diuers authors diuersly are parted
to bernard they are threefold

of repentance of confortation or strengthening when the soule burnes with desire of heauenly things

and of compassions
hugo puts three kinds of them

who walke mournfully and fruitfully before the lord of hoastes

some for remission of sinnes others in the sweetnesse of grace the last in desire of glory
ephrem the syrian comprehending the euill sayes well some are for the losse of present things culpable others of pietie commendable a third sort of impenitencie vnremediable to wit as the scripture speakes in vtter darknesse
others yet part them otherwaies and thus speaking only of the right religious
teares are cither for gods cause or mans for gods cause in respect of others or our

selues
of others namely those by whom he is dishonoured of our selues in that he is not so honoured as he ought and we desire

for who that loues the lord can behold the transgressors and not be grieued because they keepe not his word
is there any drop of christs bloud that heares without offence the reproach thereof and rending of his wounds or is he a member of the spirituall bodie that seeth with patience the whipping by reproaches and tearing by oppressions of the rest the vessell of choyce cannot mention without teares the enemies of the crosse of christ

we know what befell good heli though too indulgent to his sonnes and to his daughter in law the godly wife of a godlesse priest and husband because the glory was departed from israel the arke of god was taken and how often it fares with the religious in heart vpon such occasions

yet haue we no smaller reason from our owne failings in the performance of his seruice vnlesse we will be rather censurers of others workes then dischargers of our owne duty
this makes the apostle with bitter lamentation to bemoane himself wretched man that am who shall deliver

me from this body of death the conscience hereof causes so many confessions and fasts of the peculiar people when god vouchsafed them religious gouernors exciting and going before them in such workes of pietie grieuing most themselues that by themselues their fathers their princes and their priests his name had bene dishonoured among the gentiles for instance whereof are hezekiah iosiah ezrah daniel and nehemiah
and experience witnesseth what sorrow godly men haue in heart when they cannot by the workes of mercy so liberally nor by prayers and

thanks so chearefully magnifie as they would him whom alone they loue saying whom haue in heauen but thee alone and there is none vpon earth that desire besides thee

the cause of shedding teares on mans behalfe is either common to wit the iniquitie and misery of all our kind whereof haue already spoken or speciall and this againe twofold either it is from our selues or others
our owne cause of weeping yet is double namely of sorrow or great ioy which some of the ancients by a figure gather of calebs answer to the suite of his daughter achsah she asked springs of water

and be gaue her the vpper springs and the neather springs
for spirituall teares shed in ioy are for the abundant grace descending from on high but in sorrow for sinnes committed here below

as for the former it is no wonder if for ioy of finding him that was lost the father wept

the sonne that was dead now reuiued be thus affected that wished of late to be accepted as a seruant but is now more entertained then a sonne by the superabounding fauour of a most tender father

thus do all the people of god giuing thanks for the grace of liuing well whence one truly saith by teares good

workes are obtained of god by teares againe they are commended vnto god

teares of griefe are either from the sense of afflicting euill or from the want of good desired euill againe commonly is knowne to be of sinne or punishment sorrow for sin is either for the act or for the guilt that is either from the trouble of present and doubfull combate which we haue therewith or from the conscience of former and knowne offences
who knowes what bitter griefe to be fighting euery houre of life and yet neuer haue the crowne till death to conquer and quell the enemie a thousand times and

yet to feare as strong assaults as euer before so that the wrestler though conquerour being wearied chuseth death rather then life as his cryes imply who prayes deliuer me out of the mire and let me not sinke let me be deliuered from them that hate me and out of the deepe waters let not the water floud ouerflow me
and a little before saue me god for the waters are come in vnto my soule sinke in the deepe mire where there is no standing am come into deepe waters where the flouds ouerflow me
and in another place of the enemy he fighting daily oppresseth me

the other kind of godly

sorrow which is for sinne is that wherein the sinners heart is pierced with the stings of former negligence or euil done whereof he saith when kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long

and again lord heale me for my bones are vexed my soule is also sore vexed

and a little after am weary with my groaning all the night make my bed to water my couch with my teares
and in another psalme there is no soundnesse in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bonet because of my sin for mine iniquities are gone ouer mine head as an heauie burden they are too

heauie for me
so the ladie paula deuout indeed not as almost the best of this age scarce in countenance and words and gesture in continuall prayers ioyning night and day filled as the father writes

that alledged lately of the psalme all the night long
for in her you would haue thought there were wels thereof so she lamented the lightest sins as though she had bene guiltie of the greatest
who being often admonished by them of like purpose that were about her to spare her eyes and saue them for reading of the gospel was wont to say that face is worthy to be fouled which contrary to diuine precept haue often painted

that bodie shall be afflicted which hath bene giuen to much voluptuousnesse long laughter must be equalled with continuall mourning the soft lawnes and precious silkes be changed into rougher cloth of haire haue pleased my husband and the world and now desire to be pleasing vnto christ

as for sinnes we mourne past and present so for punishments present and to come
for feeling the one and fearing the other of euil suffered he complained whose is that prayer intituled of the afflicted when he is ouerwhelmed and powreth out his complaint before the lord as the context thereof doth tell and otherwhere

testifies his weeping on this behalf in these words mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction
whence also ieremie though sanctified in the wombe

complaines wherefore came forth out of the wombe to see labour and sorrow that my dayes should be consumed with shame

from which words another inferres the bitternesse of that other griefe in feare of hell in this maner if he thus spake of himselfe whom god sanctified in the wombe what then shall say of my selfe whom my mother conceiued in sinne woe is me my mother would say why hast thou borne me a sonne of griefe and sorrow why died

not in the wombe come out of the belly why did not perish presently why did the knees preuent me or the breasts affoord me milke that am borne for burning and to feed the fire would had died in the wombe and it had bene my graue for euer so had bene as not bene carried from birth to buriall
from which feare we may vnderstand that deprecation to proceed enter not into iudgement with thy seruant for in thy sight shall no man liuing be iustified
this feare how euer it ought to be by loue expelled yet now and then it solicites euen the best and though of their weaknesse yet by the diuine grace for their good
for

as saith the father the feare that lusts for conuersio breeds contrition
thus hezekiah wept fearing death that time it seemes not assured of a better life

the good desired for want bewailed is either the grace of good workes or glorie of free reward
teares for obtaining or retaining the rule of rightly liuing are those whereof it is written they that sow in teares shall reape in ioy
and those whereof it is said wept and chastened my soule with fastg of this sort is the weeping of all repenting sinners as the lord speakes of the churches gathering they shall come with weeping and with

supplications will leade the
this promise of being led implies those teares were ioyned with supplications that they might be led the right way the way euerlasting as the prophet cals it

in hope and feruent desire of future glorie doubtlesse dauid in this same place especially lamenteth as also father simeon

howeuer patiently bearing the delay yet earnestly desiring the well of life

so paul but our lord especially being about to lay downe his mortall life

this is it that gregorie saith some weepe for feare some in loue that is in griefe for deferring of glorie promised which for this cause most wisely

god deferres that while desiring long we long the more louing and enioying we may the more esteeme

weeping for others is because either of the wicked their destruction or affliction of the godly
of the former kind are dauids teares

for both his aduersaries saul and absolon dead in sinne

our lords ouer ierusalem ready to be lastly ouerthrowne pauls ouer the corinthians

that had sinned but not yet repented and other the enemies of the crosse of christ samuels for sauls abiection

finally after this kinde wept our sauiour ouer the iewes

raising lazarus to

life that had reioyced for the apostles in lazarus his death
what meanes it saith augustine that the lord is said first to be glad in the death of lazarus and after to haue wept in the death of lazarus but obserue we the cause of ioy and the cause of teares he was glad for the disciples he wept for the iewes he was glad for the disciples because by the resurrection of lazarus their faith in christ shold be confirmed he wept for the iewes incredulitie because neither when lazarus was raised they would beleeue in christ the lord
to which purpose may be referred his charge by ieremie weep not for the dead

for the dead in bodie alone neither

bemoane him but weepe for him that goeth away fio the communion of the church which he seemed to haue for he shall returne no more nor see his natiue country the heauenly kingdome whereof the people of god are all citizens

lastly we may ought to weepe for the affliction of gods people as ieremie and many others for iosias dead
elisha foreseeing in spirit the desolation of israel by hazael

and iobs friends astonied at his calamitie
for so shall we make our selues partakers of their ioy partaking in their griefes not being indifferently affected much lesse reioycing or insulting ouer them that are in miserie

as is the miserable maner of some
the eye inflamed

is something pained by the softest medicine and indifferent words may oppresse the mind that with other calamities is already troubled
the daughters of israel by a custome went yearely to lament the daughter of iepthah the gileadite foure dayes in a yeare euen after she was dead for her solitarie life being addicted to perpetuall virginitie by her fathers vow much more ought the saints for with one another in their life who are by spirituall coagmentatio one anothers members
these are last in order which are but ought not

to be least in vse
the heathen man hath truly said nothing dries sooner then a teare especially in anothers calamities

these are the things for which healthfully fruitfully teares are shed

wherefore let vs sow them not in the barren wildernesse but in ground receiuing raine rendring much increase
for the world is wont to weep for the losse of worldly friends as father and mother son and daughter brother and sister kindred or acquaintance after the flesh but weeping for their dead they weep not for themselues they lament the losse of earthly things but neuer a iot bemoane their spirituall damages
is any sicke in body or

dyes out of it his friends mourne
he sinnes damnably liues incestuously calls his brother foole his eyes behold strange women and lusts after them not one bewailes him
vnhappy health blinded sight dead life for those things they mourne that ought not to be moaned and greuously lament that for which a little were enough but those things they do not lament at all which of all most worthy are
yea oftentimes laugh because of such of whom esaias woe vnto them that call euill good and good euill that put darknesse for light and light for darknesse that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter
let vs lament my brethren

moderately the losse of friends but more our want of good workes our want of vertues
let the vnchaste lament the losse of his or her integrity the proud the losse of humility the wrathfull the losse of inward quietnesse the couetous the losse of bountifulnesse the drunkards the losse of sobernesse the dead of heart the losse of spirituall reioycing the enuious the losse of charitie for happie are those that now in repentance weepe for they shall laugh obtaining pardon next being clothed with righteousnesse and last and most receiued into glory
which god graunt vs all by his sonne our lord iesus christ amen

in the eight and last place of our proposall concerning this subject

remaines to speake after our little holding measure something of the dignitie and praise of this grace of teares which euen by the witnesse of them that are without

are precious vnions
for the diuiners haue said that those gems seene in dreames portend the shedding of teares whereto some of the church also do accord specially chrysostome whose elogie is of them what is more beauteous then those eyes which glister with the frequent showers of these celestiall waters no purple dye of iesabels painting

or renting

of the face as god himselfe doth tearme it none of herods pretious stones mixing colours with gold and siluer set about how euer resplendent reflecting the sunne beames

are any way saue by contrary to be compared with these

for those how euer together with his oration they drew from the fickle peoples mouth a word of admiration and commendation as the voyce of god yet could they not preserue him yet aliue from the fretting and eating of wormes and present stench vntollerable
but these most fitly are resembled by the sweet smelling myrrhe dropping from the spouse her fingers

whose vertue is to preserue euen the dead from putrefaction

the penmen of the holy scripture to shew vs their esteeme from teares and weeping haue giuen names to diuers places celebrious in the scriptures as men are wont to call new found landes by the names of their much respected and loued princes of which number are abel mitsraijm

the mourning of the ægyptians

and bochim weepers because of israel the mourning of hadadrimmon in the vally of megiddo

and elsewhere the weeping of iazer and at deborah rebekahs nurse her graue allon bachuth the oke of

weeping

here from the holy scripture not onely commends men but also sometime argues their religion in paul thus writing to his timothie thanke god whom serue from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceassing haue remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindfull of thy teares that may be filled with ioy when call to remembrance the vnfained faith that is in thee
for the honestie of his teares implyed the sincerity of his faith

the excellent esteeme that christ himselfe hath of them is the cause why

he doth compare his spouses eyes vnto the fish pools in heshbon

vnfitly were her eyes compared to pooles if they were not much bewet with teares

so great their glory is that in regard of the sweetnesse of those streames amidst which the church on earth is pla~ted for certaine respect one prefers it before the high pure hill of angels habitation for the ioy that springs from teares or else from which true teares do spring for ioy is either the cause or effect of all religious teares the heauens saith he knew not but by the children of the church

for the angels haue from their beginning and for euer ioy without all experience of

the contrary
the church this while hath them both in practise and shall hereafter esteeme more highly of the one hauing proued the other

how worthy are those of all to be commended which by god so choisly in his bottle are conserued

most noble must needs be that wine which is layd vp in the kings priuie cellar which vnder a speciall key is kept the stopping and straining and drawing whereof if we may say it lawfully the almightie hath vouchsafed no not to any celestiall minister

that my soule were another ezekiels booke written within and without written say with lamentations and mourning and woe
that might be found so forward to weepe as haue bene bold to sinne and such intention as haue had in offending so great deuotion might haue in repenting

teares are that which in her choisest children the church euer most frequently hath vsed whither hold may be referred which in the mysticall writings is obserued those first fathers of the faithfull congregation abraham meane and isaac are euer reported to haue digged wells but philistines to haue stopped them
so speakes the prophet of the

wayfarers that iourney towards heauen who passing through the valley of mulberries make it a well

how but digging by continuall contrition the wells wherout they draw the liuing waters of lasting consolation they dig vp fountaines still that as one well it all appeares but satan and his angels stoppe them with all their might that israel and iudah with all that ioyne vnto them

might for want of water perish in the wildernesse wherethrough they go to fight against incestuous moab
so againe it is recorded by a song not as a matter of an externall letter

that the princes of the

people digged the well they digged it with their staues at the appointment of the lawgiuer
will with israel most gladly say spring vp well euen out of my hearts veines so will cheerefully sing vnto it magnifying him that made it and put water thereinto

euen the lord himselfe of whose laughter in all his dispensation in the flesh we heare not so much as once mention yet at least thrise is reported in the gospell to haue wept

for the cities destinie

for the iewes infidelitie

for the acceptance of his owne prayers with the father

which obseruatio is often know not whether first

in the triumviri of the grecian church of their time
he wept

as augustine preaches that with his teares he might blot out the sinnes of the world that he might abolish the of legall ordinances that was against vs which was contrary vnto vs for saith he if peter could with the shedding of his teares wash off his spots ministerially why should we not beleeue the sinnes of the world are wiped away by christs virtually finally after the lords teares many beleeued at lazarus his resurrection so partly his piety ouercame the iewes infidelitie and the profusion of teares first softened their rebellious hearts

blessed are these water flouds whereby euery wall of sinne is broken through and ouerborne wholsome waters that quench and cast out the poyson of vices a constant lauare which so often is able to cleanse as mans heart hath need of purging
this is beloued the hear be of that heauenly fuller wherewith he daily whites his seruants vestements when they are fouled this is the spirituall niter which being it selfe composed of the dew of diuine grace wipes out the blots of our slippes this the precious lixiuie wherewith the inner man his head is washed
this is the holy teare sweet solace against our daily falls which as it were the vicar of christ

his passion giuing remedie against iniquitie that thereby christ may seeme so often to die in efficacie as the elect of god comes into the deepe
this alone is the health of soules the remission of sinnes a spirituall sacrifice acceptable to god a burnt offering full of marrow
is the sinners heart humbled and bewet with daily teares this saith the father is a goad whereby god is enclined to man the cord whereby he is strongly bound vnto him without which saith he neither baptisme auailes those that in ripe age receiue it and the lords body is taken to condemnation without which there is no fruit of hearing the word no reward of workes

wherefore let none be voide of teares whom the dignitie of the israelitish name commendeth from the action or affection the exercise or desire the shedding or remembring them no good man be destitute at any time at whatsoeuer solemnitie in whatsoeuer mirth if so be he will prolong his gladnesse to perpetuall whereas the word of truth tels

the other ends in heauinesse and without doubt vnpleasant vndelightfull wherefore the author and giuer of all our ioy better prouiding for it not onely appointed a fast of afflicting soules on the tenth day of the seuenth moneth

but also on euery monethly

and yearely feast appointed a goat to be sacrifised for remembrance of sinne

which also that pious penitent seemes not to haue misknowne presenting our redeemer at the pharisie his feast with more welcome dishes of teares then all that cheare the euent also whereof approued the deed when our sauiour indeed by open protestation preferred the

the like whereof againe he exemplified in his owne person for comming in triumph to the towne

in a most celebrious manner accompanied with the multitudes cutting downe branches strawing the wayes spreading their garments

crying haleluiahs and hoshangnahs to the sonne of dauid dauids lord acknowledged in spirit wept ouer them
the third meditation of the chiefe cause of godly teares

thus by occasion of dauids teares haue digested as could the whole subiect of teares next is to consider the matter of dauids teares in the proper cause which in this wise himselfe deciphers while as it was said vnto me daily where is thy god for this is the other part of the verse containing the cause of that sorrow related in the former
this cause is declared in termes first

more generall and then more speciall
this is the generall comprehension while it was said vnto me daily which shewes the iniury in the matter person and time the matter is in this while it was said whose quality on the aduersaries part and manner of expressing by the innocent iniured may be considered

ob&seruatio


the kind of iniury that it is in word not by deed sauing that reproach and vniust accusation is the mouths wicked worke no lesse to be imputed to the heart then that which is acted by the hand do then words grieue godly men yes no lesse the lips then hands words the blows nothing

here we heare of losse in banishment of the feare of death no mention the tongues offence alone causeth all teares while it was said for as speakes one adagger smites the body the soule is pierced by the tongue a deadly dagger is an euill tongue striking three through with one blow when as it smites the conscience of him that heares and wounds the charity of him that is offended at once slayes with it selfe both the other
this tongue verily is a viper poysoning three with one breath a yea a threeedged sword is this tongue
their tong is a sharpe sword

saith the same innocent in another place
bernard

bids on his credit not feare to say that such a tongue is more cruell then the speare that opened our lords side for that may adde something to his reason it being thrust in at a moment water and bloud issued out scarce an houre but this both night and day drawes out of the heart drops dried with cares and feares vnto the soliditie of bread and as he saith this also pierceth christ his side and the member of his member neither pierces it being dead but maketh it dead by piercing
for if he had not preferred the life of this body which now is pricked and pierced to that which there was nailed he would neuer haue giuen that

for this to the paine of death and shame of the crosse

v&se
go to now you that say speech is a light thing words are but wind the tongue of man is but a little and tender and soft flesh what wise man will much regard it true it is speech is light for it runs rather flies lightly but it wounds heauily it passeth lightly but it burnes grienously lightly it enters in vnto the soule but goes not easily out againe it is vttered lightly but it is not so recalled it fires swiftly and therefore suddenly wounds charity
the dead she is a thing contemptible but it causes the oyntment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking sauour
the tongue is soft but it is so

slipperie that hardly it can be held tender and little in substance but great and forceable in vse a little member but if it be not ruled a great mischiefe thinne and broad and long an instrument most fit to empty both the speaker and the hearers heart easily a man slips in his tongue and as easily therewith he slides into anothers soule so that it hath little auailed some to haue bridled their owne while as they haue not shunned others

and yet would god this plague could be so bounded that it hurt but two that the contagion of it did not reach vnto the wounding of the third and innocents and vpright persons

for hereupo not onely dauid in this place but also in other much agrieued prays with all attentio both for taking away reproch contempt now present and also for holding away the like yet feared and that by the weightiest arguments on both sides as could be vsed of his owne obedience and gods clemencie
for the one remoue from me reproch and contempt for haue kept thy testimonies
as if he had said this will esteeme a great reward of all my seruice if thou remouest this reproch
and after turne away my reproch which feare for thy iudgements are good requesting this as a speciall fruite

of the gracious promises to be deliuered from such reproches
this ieremie the prophet with crying out clamour condemnes as violence and spoile that the word of the lord is made vnto him reproch and derision daily
the selfe same thing nehemias the restorer of gods citie and repairer of his fathers sepulchers accounts most worthy of weeping and mourning and fasting and prayer before the god of heauen that a remnant of the captiuity in the prouince were in affliction and reproch being derided of the nations that were about them
finally this with one consent is the whole churches supplication to the lord

remember lord what is come vpon vs and of those things this is first consider and behold our reproch

indeed the account of good esteeme the esteeme of credit hath taken so deepe roote in the nature of men that reproch alone is to darken the mind with clouds
therefore the prophet of the god of israel afflicting with condigne punishment the priests of baal frets them not with vniust calumnies but with reproches most deserued pourtraying out in contraries what is that god in whom they trust and saith the scripture it came to passe at neone that elijah mocked them and said crie

aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a iourney or peraduenture he sleepeth and must be awaked
therefore the holy women rahel and elizabeth

triumphing and reioycing for remouing the reproch of barrennesse

declare that they before lamented not so much for not bearing children as for bearing infamie
herefore are seuen women said vpon most vnequall termes to take hold of one man saying we will eate our owne bread and we will weare our owne apparell onely let vs be called by thy name to take away our reproch namely that same reproch as some suppose

whereat those twaine named

before and a third most vertuous woma hannah so much were troubled

v&se
yet some as a flint haue hardened so their faces that not onely refusing to put on holinesse but daring to put off humanitie feare not to fulfill that of the prophet the vniust knoweth no shame

and that another saith thou hadst a whores forchead thou refusedst to be ashamed
and this last prophet in another place
were they ashamed when they had committed abbomination way they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush whose iudgement follows therefore shal they fall among them that fall
surely it proceeds

from an ingenuous to wardnes that ephraim is ashamed

yea euen confounded because he doth beare the reproch deserued of his youth and iudah the soune of iacob

fearing the shame he had deserued by his whoredome if it had come to light
but it is much more commendable to blush being vniustly blamed
whence in part appeares what difference there is betweene the wicked and the iust of whom the one is not affected with the filthiest and most deserued shame of his owne vngodlinesse the other is tormented with the most vniust suspition though of the lightest crime haue heard

saith he the defaming of many the effect whereof is in him feare on euery side
beware therefore to reproch such persons vnlesse thou wilt be more cruell then they that rage with fire and sword
reckon thou senacherib and rabshakeh amongst the first chiefest because euer an honest minde is more afflicted with words the blowes as solomon in the prouerbes doth confirme a reproofe entreth more into a wise man then an hundred stripes into a foole
and experience proues no lesse in them that are tried with both whither may referre that which saint hierome doth relate he saw

in ægypt a yong man a greeke that could by no abstinence no wearinesse of labour quench the flame of his owne flesh him saith he the father of the monasterie saued by this deuice or did he rather destroy him by a vicious lye and constrained continencie therefore not of gods gift he commands a certain ancient man to pursue the fellow with chidings and reproch and when he had so abused him to be the first complainer witnesses being called spake for him that had done the wrong he on the other side persisted with teares protesting all was vntruth none gaue credit onely that father in subtiltie opposed his defence lest of too much

sorrow that brother should be swallowed vp
what more thus a yeare was spent which being ended the yong man being asked of his wonted concupiscence whether as yet he were troubled therewith wo is me saith he haue not leaue to liue and should lust to commit vncleannesse so to be vniustly condemned was to be depriued of life
and detraction our sauiour witnesseth is confraction that is breaking saying reproch hath broken my heart and am full of heauinesse
which the emulous ammonites of israels honour seeme well enough to vnderstand

chusing once and againe to torment the people of god in their

vengefull spite

rather with reproch then death once desiring to pull out all their right eyes that they may lay it for a reproch on israel another time cutting indeed their garments in the middle to their buttocks and shauing off the one halfe of their beards so sending them away reproching as they supposed israel who had sent their spies which both dauid accordingly repayed no doubt according to the will of god when he brought the people that were in rabbah their chiefe city and cut them with sawes and with harrowes and with axes yea euen so dealt dauid with all the cities of the children of ammon and god reuenged

with punishments of like proportion the prophets so often witnessing the same as the holy storie relates their iniurie
first to ezekiel it is said sonne of man prophesie and say thus saith the lord god concerning the ammonites and concerning their roproach euen say thou the sword the sword is drawne for the slaughter it is furbished to consume because of the glistering and in zephanie he saith haue heard the reproach of moab and the reuilings of the children of ammon whereby they haue reproached my people and magnified themselues aagainst their border therefore as liue saith the lord of hoasts the god of israel

surely moab shall be as sodome the children of ammon as gomorah euen the breeding of nettles and saltpits and a perpetuall desolation the residue of my people shall spoile them and the remnant of my people shall possesse them this shall they haue for their pride because they haue reproached and magnified themselues against the people of the lord of hoasts
which it were good the ishmaelites of our age would take into their knowledge and remembrance if they be not past all care of their owne saluation how they runne into such crimes and recompence

wherefore let all louers of god rather to giue

the strong drinke of any powerfull comfort vnto him that is ready to perish and the wine of cheerefull consolation vnto those that be of heauie hearts
yea euen if they haue deserued shame yet not vnmindfull of the case of men but if vndeserued then much more which diligently the apostle performes by writing to the hebrewes which had bene made a gazing stocke both by reproches and afflictions

and which deserued such comfort in their calamitie they became companions of them that were so vsed
and on the contrary our lord who hath bid vs by all meanes to blesse curses in the name of god him and his wife and seede that remembred not to shew mercy but persecuted the poore and needy man that he might slay the broken in heart

ob&seruatio

meanewhile here shall not be omitted dauids so mild manner of expressing so cruell a calumny when it was said as after whe they said without any particularizing of their persons
for the saints looke not so much vpon the persons inflicting as on the afflictions molesting them their endeauour is to wipe off vniust aspersions not so to traduce their accusers saue when the persons and the causes are so ioyned that they cannot well cleare

the~selues of ye one without discouering the others vncleannes
thus the church speaks thus the harmelesse doue she sighes for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheepe for the slaughter a killing we heare but the authour we know not in a word to speake so often in the psalmes he lays before the lord iniuries vexations persecutions of all sorts yet scarce shall you euer see the actors branded therewith by name which is of singular meekenesse and true rellish of christian equanimitye
sometimes in their inscriptions shall you finde those noted who gaue occasion to the complaints

plaints but vnder correction suppose it may be thought those titles are not the same authors whose is the text though both doubtlesse be inspired of god vnleast we grant it of those inscriptio~s wherin sometimes so farre as manifestation of the occasion did require he puts their names whose crimes he wrote against yet neuer fully or plainly expressing them for vnderstanding of the matter and future ages being forced obscurely he touched their names

but voide of priuate gall for shunning publike offence vseth some tra~sposition in steed of direct intimation as that which is

written muth labben for the death of nabal placing the letters backwards which are to be read forwards and in another by change where cush ben iemini

is put for kish beniamin which kind of writing vsed for feare oft times occurs in heathen writers by the names of ruffus myrmillio causidici cuiusdam crispini belidae eryphilae nomentani pentalabus and the like with some co~cealment when men will spare names and speake of vices
this lenity in two authors of one name most worthy is remarking hieronymus stridonensis hieronymus zanchius though farre distant in time yet thus farre

in spirit agreeing
for that father though angry otherwise and tart enough so as that he speakes of him selfe euen yong in rome he seemed to represent lucillius his seuerity yet when as by sea and land he fought against his enemies

he conceales their names where he may without his preiudice or else vseth other faigned or obscure in their stead as for example when vnder the name of darknesse he contests with melania her name in greeke importing darkenesse the one knowne to the vulgar latines that reade his writings not the other
the like is in that argument of suspected cohabitation and

against an vnchaste deacon against susanna corrupted
so inueighed he against ruffinus and his adherents in faigned names of grunnius luscs lauinius calphurnius lanarius scorpius canis aloinus and others
also this late and learned hierome in that dissertation as he calls it betweene two diuines and in other arguments hath done the like as also caluine and sundry others of late times where conscience and the matter so allowed
this moderation exceedingly beseemes them that are led by the spirit whose fruit is loue ioy peace gentlenesse goodnesse faith meeknesse temperance

all which may be summed in that which the giuer of this same spirit hath bid vs learne of himselfe saying learne of me for am meeke and lowly in heart

this say is christian moderation to complaine before god the iudge of so vniust offence yet without mention of the offender further then declaration of the and imploration of helpe requires
you shall find some that if death be threatned can despise it but to be belied they cannot brooke nor from reuenge containe themselues
but the saints in this as other temptations most are mooued that by their sins they haue caused god to

inflict such things on them thou hast shewed saith he thy people hard things thou hast made vs to drinke the wine of astonishme~t thou hast thou hast not saul hath doeg hath
and againe thou hast caused men to ride ouer our heads

men ride ouer him he blames them not

but makes supplication to his iudge who iustly doubtlesse howsoeuer secretly hath caused them so to do who also is most able and willing vpon request to turne them another way this lesson also god grant vs we learne

ob&seruatio


yet god his righteous seruant doth not so much excell in meekenesse that the sonnes of belial do not

equall or surpasse him in their rage whose name with their crime in absence he shuns to make knowne they no whit contented with their secret machinations breake forth vnto that furie as that openly and in presence they dare twit him in the teeth with false religion counterfeit adoration vaine co~fidence in god
for though we heare not their names yet we haue his person to who such things by them were spoken it was said saith he to me to my selfe euen to my face in my hearing
so sometimes the leuite corah

with the rubenites his complices and two hundred fifty princes of the

assembly making insurrection gathered themselues together against moses and against aaron and said vnto them openly not onely of them in their tents ye take too much vpon you seeing all the congregation are holy euery one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift you vp your selues aboue the congregation of the lord they feare not to obiect vnto the meekest of men with one breath pride ambition and vsurpation of authority
so zedekiah the sonne of chenaanah dares together smite the prophet of god his cheekes with his fists and his conscience with the reproach of a lying prophet

saying what way went the spirit of the lord from me to speake vnto thee the very spirit that long hath rested in the romish his breast
neither was the iewish nation confounded to blaspheme to his face the lord christ is hauing a diuell who often otherwaies by secret plots conspired his death
and they who in presence making faire weather to the prophet ezekiel still talked against him by the walles and in the doores of the houses yet when occasion serued both spake and did reproachfully by ieremie to his face for lift vp by successe and puffed vp with riches through the pride of

their owne countenance not seeking after god what will they feare to cast on the countenance of gods seruants will pashur the sonne of immer being not onely priest but also chiefe gouernour of the house of the lord hearing the prophet preaching things most controling his ambition and ease

feare to smite him and if authoritie serue to put him in the stockes

v&se wherefore account we ourselues dealt with most louingly our afflictions being so much more portable as we are more vnable to beare yet beyond dauid by dement of our iniquitie let vs be thankfull vnto god the author

vnto the king the minister of this our wealth that is our peace whereby we are permitted if we haue grace to leade a quiet peaceable life in all godlinesse and honestie

in this peace let vs gratulate the happinesse of our age long and much before vs desired by the whole church of god and to this day by many and most deseruing of her children which without our knowledge was prepared and without our labour is preserued for vs whereby so happie we are

that though as one obserues we can neuer be free from perils of false brethren yet of the openest and most violent aduersaries to wit pagans or

iewes or heretickes we are little afraid surely a king himselfe both good and great blessed sometime the word of god which promised him peace and truth in his dayes

wherefore next to that word it becometh vs to magnifie and blesse the chiefe instrument vnder god of our tranquilitie peace enriched also with abundance of knowledge which esaias prophesied as the waters couer the sea

meanewhile it is our part as thankfull receiuers of present things so prouident foreseers of things to come to be forewarned of shimei the fauourer of his owne

and sauls house

howeuer he lurkes yet if euer which god forbid time shold serue he would by his curses openly declare himselfe dauids enemie a traitor to him in heart vnder whose shadow he had shrouded himselfe during all the time of peace a hater of those of dauids house with whom in outward appearance he had liued most peaceably wherefore it is wisedome against all occurrences to be armed

if abner and amasah both captaines strong and valourous

of israel the one the other of iudahs hoast had not bene too credulous to ioabs friendly prete~ded neuer had either so

valiant in warre and honourable in peace fallen so suddenly and shamefully
if those fourescore from shechem from shile and from samaria hauing their beards shauen and their cloathes rent and hauing cut themselues though in superstition directly forbidden in the law with offerings and incense in their hands to bring them to the house of the lord had not so simply consented to deceitfull ishmael

they had neuer so miserably perished by his trecherie for sure they neuer ceasse off intending if at any time of plotting against the iusts death what kind of calamities they are able

which also the princely prophet by the circumstance of time implies

ob&seruatio


for saith he it is said vnto me all the day or euery day so long as the time lasteth so ofte as that space returnes which men call the day so long so often mine enemies reproach me

as in another place he expoundes himselfe mine enemies reproach me all the day and in another mine enemies would daily swallow me vp

for that they cease at all by night is not from any asswaging of their cruelty but from necessity of nature which requires sometime rest or of their vicious disposition which buries them in sleepe and

wine
wearied they may be in sinne as babylon in the greatnesse of her way

but not of it for saith the apostle they cannot cease from sinne
saul surely so long as euer he could gaue not ouer of pursuing dauid and pharao so soone as the scourge ceased returned to afflict the beloued nation and the presidents of persia so long persecuted to death the man of delights

till they cast themselues into the snare
amplificatio and to say no more thereto they haue addicted themselues whereunto their naughtenesseis their guide thereunto they are giuen ouer that is their rest and refuge which often by the word of sitting the scripture

signifies

thou sittest speakest against thy brother they that sit in the gate speake against me princes also did sit and speake against me
man eaters are they like vnto the brasilians or canibals as saint paul implyes forbidding criminations vnder the names of biting and deuouring

and consuming one another and iob thus speaking if the men of my tabernacle said not that we had his flesh we cannot be satisfied
and to his friends why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my flesh saith not the holy ghost of these truly they are gredie dogs which can neuer haue enough

what shall the seruant of god do here but beare with courage in the present and as he can shortly rid himselfe therefrom following his lord who vpon the like occasion said for my loue they are my aduersaries but giue my selfe vnto prayer
and againe woe is me that soiourne in meshech that dwell in the tents of kedar my soule hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace
and where is hope for to escape

as ioseph and ieremie shut vp in prison

bound with fetters pricked with reproaches of vnreasonable persons as with goades being innocent themselues what way they could procured their owne

enlargement so shall he withdraw himself chusing the desert before the furious bellowing of the iudgment hall and citie of cain

euer vnquiet with tumult and noise of barking dogs and yelling wolues and roring lions and leaue in end them who by their owne presage tell before their restlesse torment vexing now vncessantly so far as they are able them that are quiet in the land

whose common confession that is and complaint in the words of one he shall send from heauen and saue me from the reproch of him that would swallow me vp
god shall send forth his mercie and his truth
my soule is among

lions and lie euen among them that are set on fire euen the sonnes of men whose teeth are speares and arrowes and their tongue a sharpe sword
the speare was sharpe that pierced our sauiours side

but sharper was that iron which entred into iosephs soule

and yet a sharper sword is this tongue by intentio separating the soule from the life thereof
the life of the body is the soule the soule liues by god the life of the body is more inward then the bodie and the soule is without the life thereof
so deep he smites that strikes at god
other wounds though in the soule dauid might perhaps haue borne but that which

takes away the life of his life is vnsupportable
the word of god is quicke and powerful and sharper then any two edged sword piercing euen to the diuiding asunder of the soule and spirit but of a created spirit
the words of man as though he more mightie then god would separate from the soule of man the spirit vncreated for this is the particular cause of dauids teares that it is said vnto him where is thy god fierce is this anger and this wrath most cruell not onely in the kind but also by occasion
the kind is robbing god

not by subtractiou of tithe but by denying his prouidence to his

owne and to himselfe his godhead
but of the occasion first a little

ob&seruatio


for that euill the vngodly now do aggrauate wherewith the godly man before was grieued
he had said before when shall come and appeare before god they aske him where is thy god not as the daughters of ierusalem in the canticle humbly beleeuing that which clearly they did not vnderstand in desire to learne thus enquire whither is thy beloued gone thou fairest among women whither is thy beloued turned aside that we may seeke him with thee nor as god in the beginning louingly teaching man that whereof

himselfe could not be ignorant asked adam where art thou

but maliciously because reprochfully and blasphemously because vnfaithfully where is thy god as though they had said thou hast no god god will not regard thee

this is the little fire than hath kindled so great a matter that set on fire the course of nature being it selfe set on fire of hell
this is that dram but of deadly poison

that quite defaceth so faire a bodie of religion an vnruly euill that so tramples on him that is alreadie throwne downe
in this are iobs pretended friends

and dauids professed foes more force then the euening wolues

which when they haue deuoured the flesh they gnaw not the bones till the morrow

but these not onely which if there were no worse would seem extremely impious destroy soules to get dishonest gaine

but with or without the hope of gaine slay so far as is in them the onely hope of the afflicted soule not remembring to shew mercie to him that is already in misery but persecute the poore and needie man that they may euen slay the broken in heart
so reaching or rather outreaching the highest branch of the his naughtinesse who persecuted euen to death him whose life was almost spent in

calling him and such others vnto life like the wolfe which did deuoure the sheepe whose milke had fed him whilest he could not himselfe seeke his food
the recompence of crueltie is shewed to all in that one that neither mercie shold be extended to him nor fauor to his childre nor the iniquitie of his father nor his mothers sinne be blotted out

that blessing should be farre from him and cursing neare

so shall euery one haue iudgment without mercie that hath shewed no mercie how much more they that exercise the greatest crueltie on them that are in miserie
one man beareth hatred against another and

doth he seeke pardon from the lord he sheweth no mercie to a man which is like himself and doth he aske forgiuenes of his owne sinnes if he that is but flesh nourish hatred who wil intreate for pardon of his sinnes

application
yet thus will they deale with good men in their aduersitie that haue forsaken god in their owne prosperitie
the occasion of this insulting ouer them is that they haue waited for all my familiars watched for my halting peraduenture he will be enticed and we shall preuaile against him and we shall take our reuenge on him
and againe the wicked haue waited for me to destroy me
this hope deferred maketh

their heart sicke but when their desire cometh they desire no other tree of life
the occasion of exercising their crueltie long desired once obtained they will sure employ to the best improuement of their malice
for this is the time think they wherein if euer they shall preuaile
when a reed is bruised then shall it eafily be broken
an euill disease say they cleaueth fast vnto him and now that he lieth he shal rise no more
the tender mercies of the wicked are cruell
they persecute him whom god hath smitten and talke to the griefe of those whom he hath wounded

therefore shall he adde iniquitie vnto their iniquitie

and not let them come into his righteousnesse
all such shall be blotted out of the booke of the liuing and not be written with the righteous

thus far their sinne and gods iustice our prudence should be next considering their forwardnesse in ad+ding one sorrow to another neither to acquaint them with the weaknesses of gods elect nor to disclose the sores of their punishments to tell neither of them in gath nor publish them in the streetes of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines reioyce lest the daughters of the vncircumcised triumph
this was the care of a right religious king to conceale the

shameful fall of another vnreligious or at least wise for ionathans sake faithfull in life and to his well deseruing friend in life and to his father though very vnnaturall in death
as much in micah god commands commending to the people priuate mourning for their sinnes declare ye it not at gath weepe ye not at all namely there for else it followes in the house of aphrah roule thy selfe in the dust in the house of aphrah that is in the house of dust roule thy selfe in dust in the house of the dust of thy secret humiliation thine owne returne to dust roule thy selfe by frequent meditation

in the dust of repentance according to him that hath bid when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy doore pray vnto thy father which is in secret against whom euen whom onely to speake properly thou hast sinned and done euill in his sight that he alone may be iustified in his sayings that euery mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god who alone is the and therfore against him alone dauid faith he sinned
this is the commendation of ioseph who though deceiued as a man supposing that to be of sinne which was of the holy ghost

yet as aiust

man not willing to make that then vnknowne vessell of our lords flesh a publike example was minded to put her away priuily
it was the prudence in his owne be halfe

of the patriarch iudah though his charitie toward his daughter thamar was not equall to shun the publicke shame of the sinne which not knowne

had not giuen publicke offence by letting his pledges go rather then by enquity to shame himselfe and send forth into the church the stinking sauour of his foule offence when he might smother it within the reach of his owne and one others sense fro whom it could not be hid
speake

it the rather for reproofe of them who not content first by secret sin to grieue the spirit of god do afterwards either in deepe hypocrifie as many are proud of going meanely by publication of their sinne vnder pretence of quieting their consciences and for sooth of honoring god in shaming themselues without warrant or example of god or any of his saints dishonour his name in foaming out their owne shame

or else perhaps now in weakenesse of iudgement to discerne betweene good and euill as before for want of strength to resist the euill minister matter of obloquy to others gaining

no comfort to themselues while others enlarge their shame themselues lessen neuer aiote their sin giuing more occasion to the aduersary to speake reproachfully

then yeelding obedience to him that friendly counselleth debate thy cause with thy neighbour himselfe and discouer not a secret to another lest he that heareth it put thee to shame and thine infamie turne not away so incurring the censure of a for reuealing secrets

and iustly deseruing the iudgement of hating and deceitfull persons whose wickednesse shall be shewed before the whole congregation

but to make vse as we

beganne of the vngodly their aggrauating the euill that happens to godly men let vs learne as we may not our selues iudge the that are without

so neither we expose them that are for ought we know within vnto the censure or reproach of them without and that so much the rather because the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him that we may not seeme to further his wicked deuice or open their mouth who when our foote slippeth magnifie themselues against vs

who blaspheme not magnifie the name of god through the infirmities of his children

to which sense saint augustine

speaketh wisely what haue to do with men that they should heare my confessions as though they could heale my diseases who are a curious kind to know the life of others but carelesse to amend their owne why do they enquire of me who am that refuse to heare of thee god what they are themselues or do they know when they heare of me by my selfe whether tell the truth whereas no man knoweth what is in man
dauid and paul when as the repentance of their knowne sinnes is approued of the whole church of god commend both their fals and risings to future ages

because for this cause they

obtained mercy that in them first or chiefly iesus christ might shew forth all long suffering for a patterne to them which should hereafter beleeue on him to life euerlasting
knowing that their owne raising was set by god for exhortation and encouragement to all who should happen after them to fall not to lye still despairing of strengh to rise and stand againe which dauids words witnesse as plainely as those of paul before alledged saying will teach transgressors thy waies and sinners shall be conuerted vnto thee
for dauid by his publication as chrysostome comments becomes to offenders after as one

knowne to be throughly cured of a dangerous disease by the experience of long and constant health comming to visite another sicke of the same infirmity without hope of recouery who hath expended all his substance and vsed all possible diligence but in vaine this visiter comming and relating both how extremely he had bene afflicted with the same euill and withall by what meanes he recouered both present ease and perpetuall health at an instant cheares the patient with hope and soone after perfectly restores him by application of the medicine so hath dauid that he may do the like pen+ned for posterity his owne excesse his distresse and redresse

by the grace of god so saint austen aged hauing by a long laborious life not onely blamelesse but euen almost miraculous gained both admiration of the church of god and also a good report of them that are without

wrote for this same purpose in thirteene bookes both the wanderings of his whole life as a sheepe straying from the flocke

and also the most watchfull prouiuidence of the heauenly shepheard ouer him guiding him with his eye euen amongst the pits of destruction

comforting him with the rodde and staffe of his louing chastisements and prop of faith when his

soule fainted in the wildernesse of vnrighteousnesse and finally carrying him on his shoulders to the fold out of the which the wolfe neuer deuoured any from which none that euer were of it shall stray from it without returne
all this while reproue not that confession which vpon inward remorse seekes of some skilfull soules phisition or faithfull pastor comfort against present griefe and counsell against like sicknesse in time to come

tran&sition
in the occasion of the calumnie we haue seene much cruelty and the kind is not without impietie for without impietie neither

can it be said of the creator diui&sion where is he where is god nor to the reasonable and religious creature where is thy god the latter of these expressed in the text includes the former as the whole sumine part of it selfe
wherefore we first enquire what this meanes where is god next the purpose of the other where is thy god

ob&seruatio
where the question as we haue obserued before of vnbeliefe is prefixed to both for he that asketh where is either ignorant or professeth flat deniall
so the vngodly know not or beleeue not god the father almighty maker of heauen earth they deny the first article

of the christian faith what faith haue they of the rest for this question touching god is cither the voice of faith victoriously though laboriously fighting and ouercoming the obstacles which for greater glory of conquest are left in the way to wrestle with as that of elisha asking where is the lord god of elijah hauing smitten the waters with his mantle and of isaiah strong in faith when the people as forsaken almost quite distrust where is he that brought the vp out of the sea with the sheepheard of his flocke where is he that put his holy spirit within him or else it is the murmure

of vnbeliefe and fury of heathen blasphemie so often bewraied in the prophets to be this in summe where is their god

or where is the lord thy god

meaning

he is not at all

or else not a god being not able to saue wherefore of himselfe it is written am a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afarre off neare to the iust farre from the wicked for god as is in the greeke prouerbe runnes to his temple

in so much as none but pure can be the habitation of god most pure
and saul confesseth god is departed from him

and caine knoweth he shall be hid from the face of god
the oppressours that

seeke after the soule of the righteous they haue not set god before them which is all one as to denie him in workes

whose voice can be no lesse effectuall then that of words
the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seeke after god god is not in all his thoughts
and pharaoh speaketh plainly who is the lord that should obey his voice to let israel go amplificatio the holy ghost yeelds sufficient reason of this truth saying he that loueth not knowes not god
for how can a man know good and not loue it or not loue knowing it to be good certainly he that knowes hony to be good that is finds the

goodnesse therof in agreement with his owne taste knowing it loues it but as the saying is vnknowne vndesired
now as the apostle argues his ignorance of god by want of loue so the prophet his contempt of god by the excesse of his deeds the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart there is no feare of god before his eyes for his words passe through mine eares as really his deeds by mine eyes his workes speake within me that which his thoughts haue spoken within himselfe his thoughts that he may sinne without the feare of god haue said to himselfe there is no god but his words

say not so to others because he that hath forsaken the feare of the almightie

cannot put away the feare of men yea sure it is these two feares dwell not together whither soeuer the one comes

it casts out the other therefore the transgression of the wicked witnesseth that he beleeues not god that he denies him
before his eyes is the feare of men therefore he professeth not his iniquitie lest he should be condemned or reprooued before his eyes the feare of god is not therefore within

where he thinkes no eye seeth he purposeth he mediates iniquitie
christ saith saint hierome is

wisedome righteousnesse truth holinesse wisedome is denied by folly righteousnesse by iniquitie by falsehood truth holinesse by dishonestie by cowardise courage and as often saith he as we are vanquished by vices we deny god

there be more atheists then we are aware of the word is not in the heart of all in whose mouth it is they do not all beleeue that do confesse the lord iesus

they seeme to speake with iudgment that say as antichristianisme decreaseth atheisme preuailes that is sathans last stratageme so much more vnresistable then the former as it is more secret not auowing

it selfe as the other but as the camelion is changed by euery approaching colour so it fitts it selfe to euery occasion in euery place not beleeuing stedfastly that god is in any place
for which of them that beleeue god is in euery place beholding all actions trying the thoughts of all hearts will admit into his mind a wicked thought or act or vngodly deed but then men fall to the commission of vnrighteousnesse when they suppose that either he sees not or regards not the things that are done below the old way which wicked men haue troden who were cut downe out of time whose foundation was ouerflowen with a floud as

fashions long since vsed for want of new inuention are taken vp againe for new may be obserued now renewed as in the day when noah entred into the arke
if any could vnderstand the voyce of mens workes even of those that do not quite denye a godhead he might with an intellectuall eare heare their hearts discourse in these or like words how doth god know can he iudge through the darke clouds thicke clouds are a couering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of heauen
doth any that heare elias mocking the seruice and seruants of baal

beleeue that baal is god in his

esteeme why then should they be thought to account lehouah god whose sport is in deriding the seruice and seruants of iesus reason perswades that sennacherib and rabsakeh esteemed not them gods whose land against their wills they haue wasted of whom he saith where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharuaim hena and iuah haue they deliuered samaria out of mine hand when he obiecteth to the god of israel both vntruth of promise

and vnabilitie to deliuer iudah out of his hand doth he not denye that he is god so they that magnifie their owne

might and insult ouer his people not fearing his threates nor beleeuing his promises do indeed denye him
the scripture saith who is he that ouercometh the world but he that beleeueth that iesus is the sonne of god and yet a great part of the world beleeues it
do not euen the diuells beleeue and tremble but saith bernard do you thinke he accounts iesus to be the sonne of god who euer is the man who neither is affrighted at his threates nor allured by his promises neither obeys his precepts nor resteth in his counsels as little reason we haue to beleeue he beleeues in god that hating to be reformed casts his

words behind him
yea if we search with a little diligence we shall obserue them among vs of whom the scripture plainely speakes as denying god
for it witnesseth that they who spend their dayes in wealth spending it on their lusts say to god
depart from vs for we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes

it saith he that doth catch the poore drawing him into his net hath said in his heart god hath forgotten he hideth his face he will neuer see
when the priests say of euery one that euill is he is good in the sight of the lord he delighteth in them it is all one as if he said where is the god of

iudgement when the people keepe from his messengers his tythes and offerings

they not onely refuse to know him but also robbe him
finally to whom his iudgements are farre aboue out of their sight his saluation also is farre from them

ob&seruatio


for in this wise god that is neare to all men is farre from wicked men

god that is not farre from euery one of vs

is neere onely to them that call vpon him in truth

a ioy to them that behold his light

but a consuming fire to the wicked the same fire

as elias of candie speaketh hath burning heat and cheerefull light so doth god deuide his workes betweene

the good and bad
the absence of god is that which vnawares these mockers testifie to be the extreamest miserie and the saints confesse it so much lamenting euen the vniust esteeme thereof
when the apostle will aggrauate the great disparity of the ephesians being before gentiles and now christians he summes vp all their former miserie in this being without god in the world

at their reproch thereof baals priests spare not to cut and launce themselues

not onely the church prayes most earnestly against the appearance of gods forsaking and dauid grieues that they say there is no

helpe for him in god and iob with all his might armes himselfe against that temptation of his friends saying am as one mocked of his neighbour who calleth vpon god he answereth him
but euen cain and saul

sorrow as admitting no comfort vpon experience thereof

though they had no grace to feare it before it came

amplificatio
for euen nature her selfe in the worst abhorres to be depriued of her maker and to be without god is to be without life

in knowledge of whom it doth consist he is not onely the author of that eternall life proper to his owne seruants

but also of the naturall giuing to all life and

breath and all things
and they who but beleeue there is a spirit know that to be farre from god is to be possessed of sathan
thus farre euen godlesse men are grieued much more the godly are moued thereby to mourne not receiuing comfort

for haue they riches without god it is but pouerty haue they friends and kinred in the world yet in comparison with god

they know no father
he it is that when father and mother forsake them takes them vp

god alone is he to whom they are betrothed

to whom they are ioyned not in one flesh but in one spirit therefore vpon any desertion though but in

appearance

they lament like a virgine girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth whom say they haue we in heauen but thee alone and there is none vpon earth that we desire besides thee
and againe thou art my portion lord and againe in god is my saluation and my glory the rocke of my strength and my refuge is in god which all if in god you take from them what haue you lest wherein they may be co~forted for when in the day of his trouble he sought the lord

and found him not his soule refused to be comforted and no wonder if he do so whe as he cannot find his heauenly father whereas rahel

in the prophet likewise so refused

because her children whom she sought were not to be found on earth though they had changed it with heauen
in the earth there is no losse besides this which may not in some sort be repaired is the house burned money and mens labour will build another
hath the extortioner pilled or the robber spoyled thy substance by labor and leisure thou shalt recouer thy selfe againe
is thy wife dead another may be had or thy children thou mayst beget or else adopt others in their stead
sicknesse may be driuen from the body by helpe of physicke sadnesse

from the spirit by some conuenient delight if god alone be gone none can bring him againe nor supply his roome

application
by this we may consider in compassion ouer others that know not themselues what their condition is who still remaine such as we sometimes were carried away vnto dumbe idols euen as we were led as the gentils that know not god

meane not onely them that haue no knowledge of gods iudgements

but also and especially them yt knowing them haue turned them into hemlocke more then the nations that are without the church of whom the apostle saith whosoeuer

transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god
to whom god in the prophet thine owne wickednesse shall correct thee and thy back slidings shall reproue thee know therefore and see that it is an euill thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god and that my feare is not in thee saith the lord god of hoasts
euill it is in the present how intollerable and vnremediably euill will the end proue that which is so bitter in the bud increasing to bitternesse how bitter will the ripe fruite proue hereby may be gessed though not plainly vnderstood how painfull is that punishment of the

damned which they call the paine of losse so grieuous to the saints in the present is the ouershadowing of gods countenance that notwithstanding their stedfast hope of seeing him againe they are disquieted as though he were quite departed when the almightie saith iob was yet with me

and dauid will the lord cast off for euer and will he be fauourable no more

what sorrow to see the king in royall maiestie accompanied with all his princes seruants and loyall subiects riding in chariots of triumph because all their aduersaries are once so vanquished as they shall neuer arise againe but

himselfe to be debarred of beholding much more of partaking of that honour of all his saints to see the lord iesus with the thou sands of his saints as light cloudes carried vp aboue the starry skie with angelicke tru~pets royall voice meane while himselfe is perpetually confined below neuer againe to see that king of glory

nor haue accesse to any of his companye so that it may well be questioned whether be more lamentable depart from me ye cursed

or that which followeth into euerlasting fire
the poëts make tantalus his extreame torment to be in this that standing in water

to the chinne still liuing he can neuer drinke of it to quench his thirst wherefore their worme of griefe gnawes as painfully as their fire burnes who must euer remember

how they that followed christ in his temptations sit in the kingdom appointed vnto them eating drinking spiritually celestially vnspeakably without filling without lothing at his table in his kingdome sitting on thrones iudging the tribes yea all those that come fro the east and west and south north sitting with abraham and isaac and iacob in the kingdome of god but themselues shut out

not admitted to see the king in his

beautie
there must needs be weeping without comfort and gnashing of teeth without end
diues may know but not taste of lazarus his felicitie
would god therefore they could seeke him in time and find him as it is said seeke the lord while he may be found and that after the due order

that so they might not suffer breaches in stead of a blessing
for if dauid failed of finding for failing in a ceremony when he sought with an honest heart what hope that they shall finde him who either seeke not at all or altogether vnregularly moses finds him

in the desert in the burning bush amongst thornes his

reputed father and mother

in the flesh sought him sorrowing marie magdalen and peter weeping

the happie theefe suffering on the crosse
oh that they did not deceiue themselues supposing to find him where or as the church could not in the bed amongst roses of pleasures or in the streetes of concourse and busie imployments of this life but passing from thence a little

that is leauing these things as but a little viewed in the way for the vanitie vnder the sunne may be soone left behind vs hasten to those hid and large and magnificent things eternall

as for the children of

god what griefe they haue in their fathers absence may be gathered by that they feele vpon their parting from one another
the heathen tooke notice and aduantage thereof that were wont in times of persecution to adde affliction to their bonds by relegating and confining them to iles and mines

where they could not haue accesse one to another
and their owne and the churches affaires causing them to part thogh willingly yet hath at times much troubled them as saint chrysostome shewes in his owne case

and basils of seleucia and the penman of the bookes called samuels

in the persons and

partings of dauid and ionathan and saint luke in pauls departing from miletum

where both the inhabitants of that place and elders of ephesus they all wept sore and fell vpon pauls necke and kissed him sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more
neither is it to be wondered whereas louers in the flesh are so hardly sundred
with much ado rebekahs kindred fend her away

though to her husband with more the leuite is dismissed of his concubines father

and naomi of her daughter in law

but the spirituall bond where euer it is bindes no slacker then

the withes of flesh and bloud which often are burnt or cut asunder
the bond is loue

which the more feruent it is it is the more impatient of absence
marie magdalen

of whom it is written she loued much shewes her loue by seeking first our lord that seemed to be lost in death and continued longest of all the disciples in seeking therefore she is vouchsafed the first sight of the reuiued phenix whom also

when she findes him she holds fastest by his feete being vouchsafed to kisse them that had late trod vpon the lion and adder and trampled on the dragon
peter

of whom his maister knew

that he loued him would be with him in life and death and the rest of that colledge vpon mount oliuet follow him in the clouds with hearts eyes when they cannot in body vntill they are demanded will not say checked for satisfying so much the outward sense in point of religion ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing vp into heauen by this also may we proue our owne loue to god
for orpah though she striue a while

yet at length is perswaded to leaue naomi as the scribe desired to follow iesus but hearing the sonne of man hath not where to lay his head

returnes as he came if not

worse but ruth shewed true loue not hearkning to her that seemed to desire her absence
those that so hardly leaue the seruants companie desire much more the maisters and those whose hearts are filled with sorrow for subtraction of his bodily presence

more painfully brooke appearance of losing his fauour
hence those complaints am cut off from before thine eyes and that why hidest thou thy face from me

from this motiue is so often seeking of his face my heart said vnto thee thy face lord will seek
make thy face to shine vpon thy seruant
cast me not away fro thy presence
draw

nigh vnto my soule
make thy face to shine vpon thy seruant

and many such

which imply the vehemencie of affectio in desire of the coniunction which mind if it be in vs let vs shunne the things that might cause him to leaue his house our heart

and by honest life and vpright conuersation seeke we the lord and his strength seeke we his face euermore

ob&seruatio


let vs seeke him and when we haue him hold him fast as the church sayes would not let him go
for not onely himselfe willingly leaues those that forsake him or hold him loosely and delights in them who wrestle in holding

him but also this all the troups of vngodlinesse aime at to cast downe the castle of confidence we haue in god
this is the meaning of their saying to our soule flie as a bird to your mountaine and of that in the psalme they onely consult to cast him down from his excellencie
for who besides the lord is the excellencie of iacob there are but two kindes of temptation that he can vse either to presumption that god may forsake vs or else to despaire whereby we forsake him
by either we are alike depriued of god
this is the thing he doth here this is the wall he vndermines with this engine

where is thy god not where thine honours thy health thy wealth but thy god in whom is all who therefore being lost nothing remaines
thus he hunts for the precious life

this is the last of his temptations because the end of all worship we which is leaue god and leane to me
a skilfull fencer is he who strikes at the legs and armes and feete and sides that the more we are exercised in defending any of them he may the easier and deeper wound our head christ and god
he strikes at iobs flockes

and heards and house and children but you heare him tell god

from whom he cannot

conceale it all is that iob may curse god and so be forsaken

v&se
therefore

being not ignorant of his wiles

let vs be sober and watch against our aduersaric that goeth about espying where he may get aduantage
we ought to imitate here the serpents wisedome who when he cannot get away first of all secures his head as he can and we should fence that best which he assaultsmost the hope of god though the rest that is riches and esteeme and the like be wounded or maimed that life may remaine in the heart and spirit in the head
our sauiours answers to his seuerall temptations

ministers to vs a singular instruction concerning all the sorts of his sleights for in those three are the kinds of all for in what euer words with what euer colours to what euer pretence the enemie propounds them our defender referres them to the iniurie of god man shall liue by euery word that cometh out of the mouth of god
thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
thou shalt worship the lord thy god
this obseruation is most worthy of our imitation in all the enemies assaults

ob&seruatio


for answer to the question of these inquisitors if they will learne or that others may that will

we are first to tell them their questions about god which they make to vs are shapen by the patterne of the first that the old serpent made needlesse questions

that they may turne vs to nothing as they did our mother but it is good for vs for answer to take heed vnto the word which she neglected
wherefore out of it as paul vnto the superstitious thessalonians the god

not whom ye ignorantly worship but of whom vnfaithfully ye aske him declare we vnto you not what he is

which none can do but where he is which you demand though we could more easily if you had asked where are all other

things haue answered they are in god that word which is our wisedome answers the lord is in his holy temple

euen in that whereof the apostle speaketh the temple of god is holy which ye are
therefore as this temple is euery where the earth is filled with his glorie

so that all the people see his glorie
and the lords throne is in heauen

for the heauens of heauens are the lords
and briefly if you will beleeue himselfe he filleth heauen and earth
or if you beleeue not the testimonie of god concerning himself

though it be greater then mans yet receiue it from men and of men like vnto your selues

pythagoras will answer the one god is whole in the whole circle orpheus your ancientest diuine will giue his verdict that ioue is first and ioue is last he meant iehouah or iah before and after the ages of the world
ioue the highest point and in the lowest plant he is for euer in one and yet in euery place
and maro prince of the latine poets saying

that god his walke is through sea and land and highest heauens from whom the beasts and birds the creeping things and man the lord of all take life and motion breath and being
or briefly as the emblame reports which naturall men haue giuen god is an eye vpon a staffe

a staffe vpholding all things an eye beholding a staffe in the clementarie region an eye in the celestiall

for god loketh downe from heauen beholding all the sonnes of men from the place of his habitation he looketh vpon all the inhabitants of the earth

the heauen is his throne and the earth is his footstoole
therefore an eye vpon a staffe because his glory is most seene aboue as his helpe is most required here in things subiect to continuall change for else behold the heauen and heauen of heauens cannot containe him
he is higher then the heauens as the king whom he set ouer his people from

his shoulders and vpward so that the vpper surface of those spheres is the lowest base of his palace and yet he searcheth deeper then the lowest earth wherefore in vaine you thinke you can by searching finde out god can you finde out the almighty to perfection if he be as high as heauen what can you do if deeper then hell what can you know if his measure be longer then the earth and broader then the sea to whom then will you liken god or what likenesse will you compare vnto him where is the house that you build vnto him what is the place which you assigne him for his bound hath he not measured the waters in the

hollow of his hand and meated out the heauen with a spanne

it is he that sitteth vpon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grashoppers
and yet though he be so high he humbleth himselfe to behold the things that are in heauen and in the earth he dwelleth in his church and walketh amongest the golden candlesticks

year not onely so but in euery of his saints it is said god is in you of a truth
yea what speake we of his saints from none of you he is absent and yet with none of you he is present he is absent by his grace but is present by his power

who is euery where and yet no where being

both comprehensible and scarce comprehensible and altogether vncomprehensible
comprehensible

because this notion of god is most certaine that nothing can be spoken equall to him incomprehensible by the same reason because as saith nazianzene

this onely can be comprehended of god that he is infinite scarce comprehensible in his effects or workes comprehensible in respect of the creatures apprehension incomprehensible in his vncreated nature scarce comprehensible in respect of the things he hath created
the infinitnesse of gods greatnesse is this that we conceiue him within all things but not inlosed without

all things but not excluded and therefore within that he may maintaine all therefore without that he may containe them all
in that therefore he is without it is cuident he is the creator by that that he is within appeares that he gouernes all
for conclusion let vs adde the argutest and accuratest thinke it may be said without offence of men after the apostles in contemplation and dispu+tation together his meditation and embleme giuing great light vnto this subiect placed before me saith he to god the whole created frame and made in imagination one great masse distinguished into certaine kinds yet finit but thee lord

conceiued at euery part compassing passing through it but euery way infinite as a sea diffused through all and infinite space hauing within it a spronge exceeding great yet finite full euery where and yet compassed euery where of that sea so thought thy sinite creature was full of thee her infinite creator and said behold god and see the things which god hath created marke how he compasseth and fils them all
so the knowledge of god also which may be had of the creature is rightly resembled in that pit in the edge of the sea shewed as they report it to thomas of aquine which emptie it and carry away the water as

often as they will it is filled with other search know of god as much as you can as many new questions will offer themselues to enquirie so that we may say as well of that knowledge of god whereby we know him as of that whereby he knoweth vs the depth of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of god

and it is not good to eate much hony

euen of the know+ledge of this wisedome which is so to the soule as bony to the taste which though we find it

we must eate of it but that which is sufficient for vs lest we be filled therewith and vomite it

for the knowledge which in measure is delightfull and profitable

being too much enquired after prooues not onely vnprofitable but also vnsauorie and vnsafe

ob&seruation
but it may be this question is made not indiffere~tly not vniuersally of god but of
dauids god where is thy god for there are as paul writes gods many and lords many though to vs there is but one god and one lord
of those indeed it may be asked and shewed where they are

in this are the true god and idols differenced

for aske the heathen for his god

and he points to a stocke or a stone if you reproue his confidence therein he shewes you the sunne or moone of some other or all the hoast of heauen

or yet if you vrge god is a spirit

and ouer all then he saith in those are the parts of the highest and common god

rome also representing god in the likenesse of an aged man and professing christs corporeall presence in her masse and assigning or allowing palpable patrons to each place and towne and house doore and closet

and couch so setting vp her remembrance behind or ouer the doores or postes as when ierusalem the faithfull citie became an harlot comes nothing behind them in a visible demonstration of the godhead
but if she say she doth not knowledge them

for gods

but as patrones deputed by the great and onely god and her owne intercessors to him againe then doth antichristian rome but iustifie rome professed heathen
the daughters voice is so like the mothers that he who heares the one by symmachus and the grammarian maximus and longinianus and the other by the common plea of papists now adayes shall hardly discerne the one from the other
for saith the one of them writing to saint augustine who is so mad or besides himselfe as to denie it is most certaine that there is one and highest god without beginning without posteritie as the

great and magnificent father of nature his powers diffused through the frame of the world we call vpon by diuers words because we are ali ignorant of his proper name
and for farewel in the end of his letter the gods keepe you by whom a thousand wayes in an agreeing discord we all that are mortal on earth worship and adore the common father of them and of all mortall men
forbeare to wearie the reader with more allegations not purposing here for to dispute

there is yet a third sort which being demanded where is thy god can outwardly visibly point at him namely they who

euer worship these brittle and outward called goods whether the couetous idolater

or the ambitious sacrificer or the adorer of thais and such other faces or he that doth homage to his belly

now to leaue the first of these three with whom we haue nothing to do the heathen meane the second and the third shewe too plainly a paritie of their causes with the first shielding themselues vnder the safeguard of the same arguments
for what other warra~t brings rome present for her adoring of god in visible obiects the the patron of paganisme for her mother shall relate his words that it may

be cleare vse no fraud now saith he if long time make religions of authoritie we should be true to so many ages and to follow our pare~ts who did happily follow thesrs
neither my present purpose nor taske is to answer the ancient or moderne romes obiection for which iremit the reader to saint am brose and prudentius who purposely and pithily haue done it but to shew how the worshippers of materiall and visible gods stil do symbolize that they may also haue the argument of such vnitie as they boast that is agreement in vntruth
for not only the superstrious in doctrine but also the prophane of conuersation

haue laid hold on their predecessors arms
that which he said of victorie they say of wealth and honour and pleasure and power and all such sensible but senslesse gods
all men honour this power with their vowes she deserues to be worshipped whom he professeth to be worthy the seeking for
and after we must ioyne profite which most procures the gods credit with men
for whereas all reason is hid whence shall the knowledge of those that should be worshipped be better had then from the momorie and instructions of prosperous affaires finally after other couetous and ambitious talke thus rome vaunts

this sernice of god made the world subiect to my hests these rites droue hannibal from the walls and the senons from the capitoll
and on the other side publicke famine and thinne haruest are imputed to the leauing of that religion which seemed to cause all plentie
euen so they spake of old and still do

that sacrifice to the queen of heauen saying that whé they sacrifice vnto her they haue plentie of victuals but when they leaue off to burne incense to their owne yarne that then they want all things
so to this day they speake of poperie and the reparation of true religion that impietie may appeare in all ages like vnto

if selfe
so euery of these if you aske them where is thy god points with his finger at some thing which he worships because he worships the creature in stead of the creator

but the creator cannot be seene therfore neither shewed to these eyes
therefore it is said to israel ye saw no maner of similitude on the day that the lord spake vnto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire
and to vs no man hath seene god at any time the onely begotten son which is in the bosome of the father he hath declared him
for all things whatsoeuer he hath heard of the father he hath shewed vs
all things which were lawfull to be vttered

vnto vs

which were expedient for vs onely in the sonne for euer the father may be seene
philip hauing seene the sonne requests not wifely shew vs the father as though that would suffice him which was and is vnpossible for him
for no man hath seene god nor cansee he dwelleth in light which no man can approach vnto
and solemon saith he dwelleth in the thicke darknesse

so that if a man can passe through the darknesse he shall be blinded by the obstacle and sple~dent veile of the great light and it is not easie to pierce as nazianzene speakes through a double battlement for god that filleth all and dwelleth ouer all

though he lighten the mind yet shes before the beames thereof and still leauing it as it is able in sight to follow him drawes it by degrees to higher things yet interposeth between it his inco~prehensible essence as many veiles as were ouer the tabernacle
therefore moses himselfe though knowne to god by name much desiring to know the way of his maker

receiues this answer thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and liue

for yt iacob is said to haue seene god at peniel face to face and his life was preserued is not spoken properly

but because of the godhead dwelling bodily in christ

moses therefore can see but gods

that is his workes and that too being put by the grace of the same god whose glory passeth by him in a clift of the rocke whereon we are built that rocke is christ in the clifts of which rocke alonely

the church herselfe is lou ly

christ alone is that propitiatory or mercie feate whereby approach to god

figurally made by the hand of moses and spiritually interpreted by the apostles paul and iohn

yet it was couered with chetubins of gold

and the seraphins the~selues with two wings

couer their eyes from beholding god

and with other

two their feete

from being beheld of men
so the things of god themselues are inuisible

how much more god himselfe

that is vnbounded by any kind of limit of place of time of forme of colour of qua~tity of figure of fashio of distance or any other without body and supersubstantiall is that nature which commandeth all things

let neuer therefore the minde go out of the body to learne ought of god for that which is conceiued beyond and aboue all not onely bodily but also spirituall substance can neither be circumscribed by place nor subiect to the shapes of formed

things whose way is in the sea and his pathes in the great waters and his footsteps are not knowne
the more presumptuous are they that dare enquire for the sight of his person who alone himselse beholdeth all things but is not seene of any mortall flesh for what flesh can see the heane~ly true and vncorruptible not being able to stand against and gaze in the beames of the materiall sunne as the heathen sybil spake before paul was taught the same from heauen

this note we for our instruction and comfort

in the wrastlings of god wherewith we wrastle with those our sisters yt exceed in multitude

namely romanists the congregations of carnall men
let vs walk

as the true church of god by faith and not by sight beleeuing on him the voice of whose words we haue heard but haue seene no similitude
we haue heard the voice of his word not the immediate voice whereof the creature is not capable
for if the sound of the heauens motion be therefore not perceiued of man because his sense is not sufficient to receiue it as men of nature write then much lesse shall any creature heare the creators voice
so the word himselfe testifies ye haue neither heard his voice at any time nor seene

his shape neither hath any man seene the father saue he which is of god he hath seene the father

in whose light the father in the sonne in that manner which is meere
blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god in that they shall see him in whom they are pure being conformed to him that is the perfecter of their purenesse

for now we are the sonnes of god and it doth not yet appeare what we shall be but we know that when he shall appeare we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is as he is immortall immutable

eternall partaking of that which now we

hope for not seeing it but with patience waiting for it
waiting for to see it and enioy it but in such maner as it may be seene and had spirituall celestiall supernaturall

ob&seruation

meane while it may be said these doubt not of god where he is but denie dauid any refuge in god therefore they say where is thy god and himselfe confesseth many there be which say of my soule there is no helpe for him in god
their conceit seemes to be that god for his wickednesse though he trusted in him had forsaken him as his owne speech to saul implyes if the lord hath stirred thee vp against me let

him accept an offering and theirs of him saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliner him
so it is no new thing that the saints be accompted of the vngodly as they themselues truly are without god especially if any trouble take them
such was shimei his iudgment of him

flying from absalom and the barbarians of paul when the viper fastened on his hand

v&se no wonder if the same happen to vs which befell these

yea often to our lord iesus

children of themselues let gold fall

and lye but if any offer to take it from them they

hold it the faster so god suffereth wickednesse to snatch at himselfe in our handes that we may hold him the faster but neuer to catch him away

application
onely as those that heare how others lands are wrongfully wrong from them labour to know their owne title the better so let vs know our right in god

that we may haue wherewith to answer him that reproacheth vs trusting in his word
the canaanites beyond iordan armed themselues hearing how it fared with og and sihon the children of this generation their wisedome is thus farre imitable

neither receiue we the

report of such against any specially them that feare god
know not any who a harlot will sooner brand with her owne name then the chastest matron
beware of that a wicked doer giueth heed to false lips and a lier giueth eare to a naughtie tongue

no speech of men how many so euer say they it is well say they it is ill make the body sicker or better much lesse the soule higher or lower in gods fauour

ob&seruation


to conclude most worthy here is for obseruation most vsefull for co~solation dauids foes intending to discourage him condemue themselues and acknowledge his right in god for

in that they say thy god

it is not ours but thine as darius to daniel thy god whom thou seruest continually
so the scripture notes the rulers reuiled him that had recouered his sight of body and mind together thou art his disciple

thus wickednesse is condemned of her selfe
out of his owne mouth the vnprofitable serhant is iudged
scribes and pharises are witnesses to themselues that they are the children of them which killed the prophets

and as for vs their rocke is not as our rocke euen our enemies themselues being iudges
indeed they lie not

the lord is not the god of all but theirs properly who by sincere loue are

ioyned to him for he will be called the god of abraham of isaac of iacob and of their seed for euer
therefore also they feare not to engrosse this title to themselues god thou art my god
iacob said to ioseph the armes of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mightie god of iacob
and thomas beleeuing the resurrection which he had mistrusted said with all affection my lord and my god

application
wherefore meekly we may aske and iustly what you haue to do with the god whom you so deny as that ye acknowledge him to be ours
may we not say to you as zorobabell with the fathers of israel to

those that said they sought and sacrificed to the god of israel you haue nothing to do with vs to build an house vnto our god
or if you boast of a common and outward calling shewing no fruits of electio then heare god to her that was nothing behind you what hath my beloued to do in mine house seeing she hath wrought leudnesse with many

heare ye heauens and witnesse thou earth come all christians truly religious dearely beloued in god our portion let vs take possession of that which is freely left vs they haue chosen the world god is ours aske we him no more art thou for vs or

for our aduersaries they haue bequeathed him answer we their demand where is thy god with our sauiour thou hast said
as hauing bought her husbands companie with her sonnes mandrakes went out to meete him saying thou must come in vnto me for surely haue hired thee so go we forth and meete lay hold and keepe our god our husband left to vs as we from the wombe are cast on him
on him
we are thine lord thou neuer barest rule ouer them they were not called by thy name
to thee dear iesus

who to sanctifie vs thy people with thine owne blond sufferedst without the gate we come forth without the

campe bearing thy reproach hauing here no continuing citie but seeking one to come whose builder and maker is god wherein bring vs to raigne of thine abundant grace with thee thy father spirit of consolation in the fellowship of elect angels and glorious saints world without end amen

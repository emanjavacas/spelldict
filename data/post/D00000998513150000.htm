Published by Leonarde Digges Gentleman, in the yere of our Lorde.
[Figure: Imprynted at London by Thomas Gemini, dwellynge within the Blacke Friers: who is there ready exactly to make all the Instrumentes apperteynynge to this Booke.
ALthoughe (gentle Reader) many excellente in Geometry, vppon infallible groundes haue put forth diuerse most certayne and sufficient rules, touchyng the measuring of al maner Superficiecis: yet in that the arte of numbring hath ben required (yea, chiefely those rules hyd, and as it were locked vp in straunge toungues) they do profite, or haue furdered verye lyttle the moste parte: certes nothing at al, the Landemeater, Carpenter, or Mason, wantyng the aforesayde: for theyr sakes am here prouoked not to hide, but to open, and so encrease the talent which haue receyued: yea, to publishe in this our tongue very shortly (if God geue life) a volume conteynynge the flow+ers of the Sciences Mathematical, largely applyed to our outwarde practise, most profitably pleasaunte to all maner men of this realme.
In the meane time shall desire the Artificers aboue named to be contented with this lyttle booke (a taste of my good wyll towardes them) which wyshe euen so to farder the readers, as knowe it suffycient for the true measurynge and readye accompte of all maner Lande, Timber, Stoone, Borde, Glasse, Pauemeut. &c. Here mine aduise shall be to those Artificers that will profite in this, or any of my bokes, nowe publyshed, or that hereafter shall be, first confusely to reade them thorow, then with more iudgement, and at the third reading wittely to practise.
Note, oft diligent reding, ioyned with ingenious practise, causeth profitable laboure.
Thus most hartely farewell (louinge Reader) to whom wishe my selfe present to further thy desire and practise in these.
OTher Bokes tofore put forth in our englishe tongue conteyned onely the bare measuring of Lande, Timber, and Borde: howe agreable in all places to the rules of Geometry, let the learned iudge.
Here (gentle Reader) thou shalt plainely perceiue through diligent readynge, howe to measure truely and very spedely all maner Land, Timber, Stone, Steaples, Pillers, Globes, Borde, Glasse, Pauemente. &c. without trouble, not payned with many rules, or obscure termes.
Nor yet with the multitude of tables, as here before hath ben: in whiche not a fewe errours were commytted: for that cause no iust accompte might any way be had.
Further ye shall by this booke vnderstande the whole makinge and comely handelynge of the Carpenters Ruler, with the true measures.
And his vse appoynted to the ready measuringe of all kynde of Tymber, Stone, Borde. &c.
Also the leauelinge of groundes, takinge of Heightes, is pleasauntly and diuersely practised by the ruler.
Ye haue here not the commune but the rare vse of the Squire applied to Heightes, Lengthes. &c. and to the fyndinge of the iuste houre of the daye diuerse waies: throughe the ayde of pleasaunt tables, newely adioyned to my generall Prognostication, by the which the proporcion of thynges direct or squirewise standing, are by theyr shadowes knowen.
To conclude, in the ende of this boke is added a treatise shewyng the makynge and vse of an Instrument, by whiche ye shall get Lengthes, Heightes, Breadthes, widenesses, where, or howe so euer they stande.
Other necessary thinges are conteyned in this lyttle volume, whiche commytte to the diligente Readers.
AS there are few craftesmen, whiche haue all the kyndes of Arithmetike readely: so doo suppose none so ignorant but that they do, or maye easelye perceyue the simple significations of these Caracters or figures.
and also theyr strength, in the firste, seconde, and thirde roumes placed.
Besides that, they must be familiar with these and suche like Fractions.
The firste leftwarde betokeneth one seco~d parte of an whole, be it Pearche, Inche, or any other measure: the nexte, one thyrde, then one seuenth parte: the other ensuyng, one sixtenth.
The last is nine tenthes of an Inch: that is nine partes of an Inch, diuided into ten porcions.
These doo intend to put in my ensamples, and in my tables, and margines folowinge, to represente partes of Pearches or Inches.
As, if woulde write halfe an Inche after this maner. ½.
¶It is requisite also here to open what a Pearche, a Dayworke, a Roode, and an Acre is.
Althoughe there are diuers opinions engendred throughe longe custome in many places, of the length of a Pearch (vpon whiche our chiefe matter dependethe) yet there is but one true Pearch, by Statute apoynted to measure by.
Loe here the Acre expressed with his length and breadthe.
must not omit here to tel you what thing is metest to measure land with.
They vse commonly in the country, two peales, eyther of them the length of a pearch.
pearches in length, well seared with waxe rosyn, knotted or marked at the ende of euery pearche, is more mete readier.
But in my fantasy, the Instrument Geometrical, which is put forthe in thende of this boke, passeth all them other, for the exacte truth, quickest spede.
This instrument is so general auaylable to so sundry thinges, that it alone requireth a large boke, if it shoulde be sufficiently set forthe.
Also woulde not haue you ignorant what pece of lande is called a Triangle, which often shall hereafter be named.
It is suche a fashioned piece as hath, or is imagined to [Figure: haue thre sydes, and thre angels onelye: whether the sydes be equal or otherwyse as this figure sheweth.
Againe, note that a lyne is sayde to fall squirewise, when it cutteth any thinge, or any syde of a Triangle full crosse, lyke vnto a Squyre: As the hanginge pricked line, a. b. in .c. d. the base line of the Triangle.
Loe, it cutteth the syde squyrewise, or full crosse, in the point b. and not as the other lyne a. e. dooeth.
The Base of any tryangle is here called that syde, whiche is cut squyrewise of the hanging lyne.
Concerninge a Circle, knowe that the compasse of any circle, is named his circumference: the myddle point in him his Centre: the ryght lyne h. i. that goeth ouerthwart that [Figure: Centre, touchinge the circumference on bothe sydes, is his Diametre: the halfe of that line, the Semidiametre.
Also an arcke is a pece of the circumference cut away, as ye se the arcke aboue the lyne f. g. Also f. g. and .i. in this circle are named Parallels: for that they differ equally in al places, the one from the other.
Nowe because practyse and experience sheweth me, that there is almooste no lande, but it maye easelye be broughte by imagination, to a Triangle or Triangles, and so mooste truelye measured: therfore to be shorte, this order shalbe taken.
wyll fyrste fygure and set afore your eyes Triangled Lande, and other whiche by imagination shalbe brought into triangles.
Then shall teache the true measuring of them: meane how to finde a length breadth, with whiche ye shall enter the Table of accompt folowinge, where the acres, and odde pearches, if there be any, shall appeare.
As these fygures are measured, so all tryangled land, and other, brought into triangles, of what fashion soeuer they be, shalbe measured, And because it is requisite for true measuring of all triangles, to finde a streigth hanging line, shall shewe firste howe that Lyne is to be founde, imagined, or drawen.
Howe the right hanging line in Triangles is drawen THE II.
THis streygth hanging lyne in all Triangles, is euer drawen or imagined from any Angle, cuttinge some one syde of that triangle squirewyse: as ye may perceyue the pricked lynes in the triangles folowing.
By the helpe of this lyne, all landes of Triangle fashion, are brought to be mesured as ensueth.
IF thou be an Arithmetrician multiylie this streigth ha~ginge lyne, drawen as aboue as shewed, in halfe the nu~ber of pearches of that syde which it cutteth squirewise.
For want of that knowledge, take the aforenamed pear ches (I meane of the hanginge lyne, and halfe the syde which he cutteth) and with that Length and breadthe enter youre table of accompt, as there is set forth.
So shall ye perceaue the nu~ber of Acres, Roodes, Dayworkes. &c. Ensample.

Here note, your Table must euer be entred with al the pearches of the hanging Lyne, and with halfe the side that he cutteth squirewyse: Or with the halfe hanging lyne, and the whole syde cut.
[Figure: THis fygure e. f. g. h. is but two Triangles: and therefore measured as aboue in two partes: Or thus.
So shall ye fynde, Acres, Dayeworkes and, Pearches, the true contente of this fygrue, e, f, g, h, An other ensample.
Because it is no maner Triangle, it must be brought by imagination, as haue saied, into a Triangle or triangles.
Which imagination is here signified [Figure: by the lyne dashed.
Then as aboue is declared, it ought to be measured (accordinge to the rule of Triangles) in two partes, because there are two triangles in that lande.
So by profe ye shal finde in the vpper. i. m. l. one Acre
Thus gather the whole content of that lande to be

Then drawe a right hanginge lyne from the centre or myddes of that fygure, to the middes of some one syde.
And with that lengthe and the other enter your Table.
Note that the Triangle of all sydes like, and the Quadrate fygure, are also measured by this rule.

Ye sshal enter your Table wyth halfe ye nu~ber of Pearcches of the whole Circumference or compasse, and wyth the number of half the Diametre or breadth.
FOr perfecte knowledge and vse of this Table folowinge, when partes of Pearches are adioyned, note wel this other example that ensueth, also what is sayd of the declaration annexed vnto the [Figure: Table, when partes of pearches are in the length, breadth, or in bothe.
f. g. h. to be a rounde pece of lande: finde by measure the whole compasse
leauinge out .½. and .¾. whyche were but parts of pearches.
For those parts of pearches omitted at your first entring the table, worke thus.
The halfe pearch, quarter, or other parts of a pearch in the length, must be reckened by them selues in the whole breadth: and those of the breadth co~trariwise in the length.
If there be suche odde partes in bothe, then recken them of the length in the whole breadth, and them of the breadth in the whole length: ioining to the other aforegotten, remembring the product of the one fraction multiplied in thother, to be pulled from the encrease.
To make this matter playne, wyll take this laste ensample before.
The one number wherwyth should haue entred my Table, was

What must be done whe~ ye nu~bres wherwith ye shold enter excede your table, cou~sel ye declaration of your table there adioyned.

Roodes, and .¾. of a pearch, founde by the rule of Triangles) to the Acres pearches before searched.
This subtracted or pulled from the number conteyned in the whole Circle, the remayne is the pearches included in the smal pece beneath the Triangle.
Thinke none nowe will doubt how these two fygures folowinge are measured, because they are made of porcions or partes of Circles, whose measure is before sufficiently opened: the one consistinge of two halfe circles and a Quadrangle: the other beinge the porcion of the Circle, m. o. doubled.
[Figure: If any euyll fashioned lande chaunce to be measure, whiche requireth to be brought in many triangles, to saue labour, ye may adde some porcion vnto that, and make it square or otherwyse.
So let it then be measured: and after fro~ the product pul away that ye added: the remayne is the content.
To fynde the content superficiall, of Steples, Columnes, Globes, and theyr partes.
For picked Steples, multiplye the whole syde in halfe the Circumference of the base, addynge the playne of that base.
For Pillers augmente the Circumference of the base in the height, puttinge to the playne of both Bases.
For Globes, the Diametre in the Circumference multiplied: euen so of Fragmentes or Partes.
Let them that be voyde of Arithmetike, enter my Table of accompte folowinge, with suche numbers as now wylled the Arithmetician to multiplye, not forgetinge what haue before written: So serue theyr turne.
Or thus, by the rule of proportion, the partes of a Globe are founde.

So shall ye do of the Ascenses, that is, the goinge vp from the foote to the toppe: ioyninge the measure of the longer and shorter in one.
Nowe take the halfe of the circuites added, and the halfe parte of the Ascenses ioyned and enter your Table.

AS in the Mountayne ye measured the circuite or compasse of the base or foote: so here contrary, ye shall meete rounde about the circuite, or compasse of the height of the Ualley.
And as ye gott the measure, or compasse of the toppe of the Mountayne: so measure the circuite of the deapth of ye Ualley.
In like maner as ye measured the ascense, that is, the goynge vp from the foote to the toppe: so measure the descense, or goynge downe of the Hyll to the depth of the Ualley.
The rest all worke, as haue shewed in measuringe the mountayne.

Thus any maner Length and Breadthe, is reduced to this Table folowyng, which suffiseth.
THus with fewe woordes is ended the certayne measurynge of all maner Lande, towchynge theyr superficiall contentes.
Wherfore nowe shall folowe the trewe measuring of tymbre, Stone, Steples, Pyllers, Globes, accordyng to theyr Crassitude.
IT cometh communely to passe that Carpenters, Masons, and such like Artificers are put eyther to measure Timber euery waye square, or squared logs, broader on thone, thi~ on thother syde, yea many tymes mutilate or vnperfecte stuffe: some tymes.
or, square in the heade and so throughe, oftentymes rounde stone or tymber, with hollowed. &c. Afore shewe vnto them what muste be done with suche peces of Tymber or stone to gette theyr true measure, my desire shall be, that suche Craftesmen will leaue to be heady or self willed, yea so gredily to sticke to theyr olde corrupted rules that vtterly they refuse to be taught.
Both learninge experience declareth vnto me, that ye groundes whiche the best of them haue are false.
To open howe and where, it nedeth not: neyther doeth it apperteine to instruction.
Only it maye suffice hym that liketh the true way, here to receyue it appointed to him.
Yet to satisfie and content him whiche wil not beleue any such errours or false groundes to be: say (and truelye) that the Ruler of tymber measure, which the more parte of them hath, is not made by right arte.
Besydes that theyr craft in seekinge the square of some tymber, is very false.
They vse in measuring to lay the broader and narrower sydes together in a summe: and to take the halfe of that number for the square.
Then they seke this vntrue square vpon the false ruler: and so measuringe the tymber, they conclude of it vntruly.
As this is corrupted, so are other groundes which they take to be infallible.
Now to the purpose, touchinge the correction of those errours with other not mencioned, wherby true measuringe may ensue this way shall be taken.
After haue opened how ye must handle all such fashioned tymber (as afore is spoken of) there shall folowe a table, in whiche ye may fynde (as will declare) the square of any stone, or tymber.
That knowen, it is requisite to haue an other table immediatly folowinge, whiche may appoint to all true squares, from.
inches, the iust lengthe to make a Foote euery waye square.
With that length agreable to your square, your logge must be measured.
And as oft as ye finde it from the one ende to thother of your tymber, so oft ye may conclude the foote square to be conteyned in that tymber logge, or stone: that is, so many square sete there to be included.
This Table of tymber measure standeth in the place of a good Ruler, well docked with true measures.
By this ye maye make or correct rulers at pleasure, as after appeareth.
Nowe orderly foloweth the true measuringe of all fashioned Tymber or Stone afore named.
Howe tymber or stone, foure square euery way, or broader on the one then on the other syde, is measured.
IF a pece of Timber, or Stone be ether equally square, or broader on the one syde then on the other, ye shall take the iuste measure, meane howe many Inches the broader syde conteyneth: euen so of ye narrower.
This done ye must seke in the table of squares folowing, the measure of the broader syde of the tymber or stone, in the vpper margyne of that table.
Then looke for the number of Inches of the equall or narrower syde, in the right part hanginge margyne.
At the commune metinge, where the one number answereth directlye to the other, there your true square shall appeare.
This square so founde shall be referred to your table of tymber measure: in ye which ye may playnely see (yf you runne downe by the left margine, vntyll your Inches square appeare) howe many fete or Inches of your ruler belongeth to a foote square.
As ofte~ as that measure there founde is conteyned in the tymber or stone, so often and as many fete square ye may conclude (without doubt) that pece of timber or stone to haue.
S&Vppo&se this squared Tymber or Stone, a. b. c. d. were to be measured, the broader syde, a. b,
must be founde in the right syde and hanginge margine.
This true square muste be searched for in the Table of tymber measure.
Somedele lesse of your ruler then and .¼. layed out vpon the Tymber, maketh a fote square.
And that measure so discretely handeled, is conteined in the lengthe of your tymber sixetymes.
Wherefore affirme sixe fote there to be, besyde that is left parte of a foote.
Note because the squares, at al tymes (as in this ensample) ryse not to euen Inches, but sometyme to odde partes: Therfore accordinge to your discrecion, adde or take away some part more or lesse in setting forth the fote square, as aboue is parformed.
It were intollerable tediousnes, yea impossible, to sette forth ye true quantities of tymber measure, to allodde quantities of squares.
The discrete handlinge of these, the wyttie shall bringe to a sufficient exactnesse.
WHen Tymber hathe diuerse equall squares in the heade and so through: fyrst measure all the square sydes round about the heade or ende of the Timber.
Then take halfe the number of the whole measure for thone Breadthe.
Then measure from the Centre (which is the middle of the heade, or ende of the Tymber) to the myddes of one square syde, betwene the two angles: and take the measure of that distance for the other Breadth.
Nowe resorte wyth the measures of these two breadthes (as tofore) to the Table of squares: seking the bigger number or breadth in the vpper margyne, and the other lesse in the syde margine.
With the square there founde, haue recourse to the table of tymber measure: and do as haue instructed.
e. f. .g. h. shoulde be measured, euery syde being
Then the line .e. f. which goeth from the Centre or mid+des of the square to the middle of one syde, is
muste be sought (as afore) in the table of squares folowing.
Then se howe oftentymes that measure (so with discretion handled) is from the one ende of your tymber to the other: and affirme so many tymes a foote square there to be, as that measure is founde in the lengthe of your logge.
Howe rounde and hollowed Tymber, Steples, Pillers, Globes .&c. are to be measured.
FIr&st gyrde the logge rounde about with some lyne: then diuide the lyne, whiche compassed that tymber, in two equal partes, kepe the one part for the bygger Breadthe: After ye shall diuide againe that whole length (the twenty and two parte cast away) in thre partes, and take the halfe of one of them for the other narrower Breadth.
With the measures of these two breadthes, haste to your table, performing all thing as afore is opened.
[Figure: SUppose this little piece of Tymber .i. k. l. m. were to be measured, the compasse or gyrdinge

IF it chaunce that hollowed Tymber be to be measured: measure the whole logge as though it were not hollowe, as aboue is declareth.
Then measure the narrower and broader syde of the hollowe: and see what is conteyned in that, as though it were massy Tymber.
Nowe pulle out the content of it, from the whole aboue measured: the remayne of force muste shewe what tymber is included in that hollowed body.
Am vnable in few woordes to expresse to the vnlearned, by what meane Pyramidal, or picked regular Steples of all fashions are measured.
Also how Pyllers: how the content of Globes or Bowles are searched: vnlesse the arte of numbringe were tasted.
MUltiply the playne of the Base in the third part of ye height: so ye haue the Crassitude.
Or multiply the content superficiall (founde as haue instructed) in the height of the Steple, takinge for your purpose the thyrde parte of that product.
Increase the base playne in his altitude or height: so haue ye your desyre.
THe content superfycial founde (as haue opened) must be multiplyed in the syxte parte of the Diametre: the product is that ye requyre.
Or the thyrde parte of the Superficiall contente in half the Diametre.
Or multiple the plaine of the Circle in the whole Diametre: then take two thyrde partes, which added make the crassitude.
HIs superficial content multiplied (as is sayd) bringeth the magnitude of him.

It had not bene nedefull to haue put the partes of the square so precisely as they are here: neyther is it requisite so curiously to take them.
The table of Tymber measure, with the declaration and use of it.
[Figure: THis Table (as ye see) is deuyded into twoo columes or rowes: the one very shorte, the other longer.
In the headde of the Fyrste haue put this woord Fote in the Seconde rowe Inches and partes: to signifie feete, inches, and partes of inches.
The summes in the margyne and lefte parte of the fyrste and seconde colume, declare the quantitie of the square of timber or stone, from to

hath a prycke by hym, it betokeneth some small quantitie lesse then of an ynche.
If it hadde twoo pryckes or poyntes thus: it shoulde signyfie some lyttel quantitie more.
Neither maketh it matter, whether ye obserue this prickynge or noo, the quantitie is so lyttel to be added or pulled awaye.
Note what hathe ben spoken of Tymber, the same also is to be vnderstande of stone, lyke wyse to be measured.
¶Thus is finyshed the measuryng of timber, nowe ensueth of Bourde. &c. Howe Tables, Bordes, Glasse, or any such like are measured, accordinge to theyr length and breadth onely to the foote square.
THis thing is performed by ye helpe of a large table folowing, diuided in sixe smal tables, and as many margines The fyrst and left marigne be ginneth at .¼. whiche is one quarter of an ynch, and extendeth to
Inches, as ye may playnely perceyue yf ye runne downe by that margyne.
This hath his Table on the ryghte syde adioyninge vnto him.
Of this that is sayd, you may gather that euery margine hath his Table on his ryght syde.
Also you muste knowe that in the top and beneth haue put (as in the table of Tymber measure) these words, fote, ynche, and partes, to sygnify fete, ynches, and partes of an ynch.
Whensoeuer ye lyste to measure, Borde, Glasse, or any other suche, with the breadth of it enter this Table: and seeke that breadth in his proper margine.
There ye shall fynde in right order how many fete, ynches, or partes, of an Inche belonge to a foote square.
So often as the measure is in your stuffe, iust as many fete haue ye in that borde or suche lyke.
If the breadth excede this Table: than diuide ye breadth in partes and worke as is and shall be declared.
So the ingenious applyeth this Table for all maner breadthes moste exactly.
SUypose haue a pane of Glasse, or a borde, whose breadthe were
So much of my ruler (wanting some small quantity) maketh a foote.

HE that desyreth to measure Chamber floores, Pauimentes, or such lyke: let him onely multiply the Breadth with ye lengthe: so the producte sheweth the contente.
must nedes conclude (by multiplicacio~ of that le~gth in the breadth) there to be conteyned.
Or thus without Arithmetike when the breadthe exceadeth the Table.
DIuide the breadthe in partes (as is opened in the declaration of the Table of accompt) and worke as haue before instructed.
So for Pauementes all maner wayes it serueth youre turne.
Of this matter to put for the tables, were superfluous tediousnes and follye.

[Figure: BEcause the effect of this Ruler is aboue declared by Tables, an Instrument also wel knowen and commune amonge good Artifycers: will not spende many woordes, in opening it.
Beholde the fygures, and learne by them howe ye ought to make, and commonly to decke youre Ruler, bothe with Tymber and bourde measure.
ADmit the ruler to be. a. b. c. d. wel playned, twelue Inches longe, a quarter of an Inche thicke, and two Inches yn breadth.

The commune vse of the Carpenters Ruler, touching the face afore put forthe.

Therefore laye out that measure vpon your Tymbre, and recken howe many tymes ye maye fynde it, from the one to the other of youre logge: for so many foote of Tymber is there.
Seke the breadth vpon your Ruler, in the roume or place of borde measure, and immediatly before your eyes there remayneth what is to be layed out to make a iuste foote of borde.

IT behoueth you to loke thorow your sightes. q. r. placed in the thicknes or lyne. k. m. a fyne threde and plummet fallinge at libertie out of the centre. n.
If this plummet and threde chaunce precisely on the lyne of Leauel (whiche is. n. o.) whatsoeuer ye se thorow the syghtes, is leauell with your eye: yf otherwyse, the thinge that ye looke vnto is not leuell, eyther more or lesse then the height or leuel of your eye: More yf the plummet fall to youwarde: Lesse, if contrary.
Howe by the lyne of Leuell to forsee whether the water of any springe or head is possible to be brought to a place apointed, and also to iudge the holesomnes of it.
YE shall go to the head or spring, and set your Ruler to your eye (being in height equall with the water) so ye the fyne corde and plummet fal precisely on the line of Leauell.
Nowe yf thorow the syghtes, ye may se aboue the place, knowe and iudge the water possible to be brought, yf your syght fall vnder, impossible.
It cometh communely to passe when the place to the whiche ye woulde haue water conueyed, is of any great distaunce from the heade, then hylles, valleyes, and suche lyke impedimentes lette the lyne vysuall to haue his free course: wherefore this remedy is prouided.
At the heade of the springe, ye shall loke thorow the syghtes (as before) and note a marke in the next hyll towarde the place, then go to ye marke: in lyke maner obserue there an other in some hyll: so forthe vntyl by any of them ye may perceyue the place desyred.
If then your syght running through the pinnes of your ruler, (the threde euer fallinge on the lyne. n. o.) excede that place, the co~ueinge of your water is possible otherwise not.
Nowe by the waye brieflie ye shall be enstructed howe ye maye knowe the holesomnes of water.
TAke a cleane pot and put water in it: so set it on the fyre: after a little boiling, poure it owte: if the~ no filthie remaine in the bottome of the potte, it maye be iudged the houlsomer.
Let fall droppes vpon metel, or rather on glasse (any of them beinge polished) and suffer that to drye by it selfe: if after there remayne no spot or sygne, it is a good token.
Moreouer, if your water be swete, pure, clere, light, or of littel weight, it followeth ye water to be holesome for the vse of man.
WHen so euer the threde and plommet do chau~ce iustly on the heigt which is n, p: the altitude or height that ye see is euen with the dista~ce from the Middle of your fote to ye nether parte directly vnder the toppe equal with your standinge, addinge the heigt of your eye downewarde, Know that ye must euer stande vpright with body and necke, your fete iuste to gether, the one eye closed.
IUdge also any thing plumbe vpright when the thickenes of your Ruler. i. l. is closely theron, the plummet then at libertie, fallynge on. q. n, named the line of Heightes vpright.
To searche out heightes by the Scale, with the ayde of two places.
LEt the threade and plummet fal in the one, on the
of the right shadowe: double the dista~ce betwene the two places, the summitie appeareth from that part of ye thing measured, which is equall in hight with your eye.
of the contrary shadowe, then the space betwene bothe ye stacions is equall with that ye measure, euer vnderstandinge from your eye vpwarde.
Euen that same cometh to passe, if in the one the threde be founde vpon the
of the co~trary: In all thes the Spaces are equall with the altitudes.
So then in measurynge the distaunce betwene the two places, ye haue the heyght, from your eye vpwarde, puttyng to it the length from your syght downewarde, the whole Altitude appeareth: the base beynge equall wyth your standinge.
Woulde not haue you ignorant here howe to knowe lengthes which be in height not easy to come vnto.
Fyrste (as before) get the height of the toppe, the altitude of the base or longest parte of your lengthe.
Subduct the lesse heighte out of the more, of force your desyred lengthe remayneth.
Or thus: Let the plummet and threde fall in the
marke your place: go in towarde the thinge (the threde as it was) vntyll ye see the base of that lengthe: the distaunce betwene the two standinges, is vndoubtedly the lengthe.

Certes the trueth euen here maketh mee confesse the same: yea, that there is no instrument so generall and profitably pleasaunt.

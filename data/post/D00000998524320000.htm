The solace OF THE SOVLE AGAYNST the bytter stormes of sycknes and deathe, greatly encouragynge the faythfull, paciently to suffer the good pleasure of God in all kynde of aduer+site, newly set forth in Englysshe by Thomas Becon.
Refuse not the chastenynge of God, nether grudge thou, when he correcteeh the.
VERE notable is thys saiyng of our LORD and sauiour Iesu Christ he that continueth vnto the ende, shalbe safe, for it declareth vnto vs, that thoughe the most and greatest parte of oure lyfe semeth to be spente bothe faythfully, and godly, yet yf we perseuer not in fayth and godlynes euen vnto the last breath, but let slyppe our holde, that we haue hadde heretofore of fayth and godly conuersatyon in Christ Iesu, all the laboures, paynes and trauayles, that we haue susteyned in the former parte of our lyfe, are frustrate and vayne.
For noman that putteth hys hande to the Ploughe and loketh backe, is mete vnto the kyngdome of God.
And it is wrytten in the Reuelatio~ of saint Iohn.
Be faithful vnto the aud shal gyue the crown of lyfe, the crowne of lyfe is
But to whome? verely to those that be faythfull euen vnto deathe, as saynte Paule sayth.
Noman is crowned excepte he stryueth laufully, to stryue laufully, is not to play the cowarde in the battell of Christ our captaine, to giue place to our aduersaryes, but at all tymes valeauntly to fyghte agaynt them with the stronge and myghty shylde of faith, and so to contynue euen vnto the ende.
And albeit thys conflycte betwene the faythfull Christyanes and ther enemyes be at all tymes ieoperdous and full of peryl, yet in in the tyme of syckenes, and when deathe begynneth to drawe nyghe, it is most daungerous.
In healthe and prosperite Satans assaultes seme to be but tryfles and thynges of daliauns, but in aduersite, trouble, sycknes and death, they appere moost vehement, greuous, terrible and not able to be resysted, at whych tyme, yf we gyue place, we are vndone, yf we manfully resist, the victory is oures.
We muste therefore (godly reder) agaynst thys so perillous tyme of sycknes and death, so furnyshe our selfes vnto thys battayll, that we be not put to flyghte, euer remembrynge that oure stryfe and fyghting, is not against bloud and fleshe, but agaynste Rulers, agaynst powers, against the lordes of the worlde, the Gouernours of the darkenes of thys worlde, agaynst spiretuall subtilities or wylynesses in heue~ly thynges, meane Satan with all his infernall army and deuellysh warryours.
And forasmuche as our pryncipal conflycte and chefe battel is in tyme of syck+nes paynes of death, and seyng we haue then most nede of consolation and comforte, that we be not ouercome nor subdued of our enemyes, but know how we shal both take the crosse of Christ, appere it to fleshe neuer so painful, put our aduersa+ries to flight so continue faithful to the ende: haue tra~slated this ly+tel treatise folowing, wherin finde most swet prese~t co~fort both for thy selfe other, an armoures or wepens to defende thy selfe agaynst all thyn enemies, that not they ouer the, but thou ouer them mayst full gloriously triumphe, get the victori through Iesus christ our captayne, this lytyl worke to be in the ha~des of al the faithful at all tymes, but specially in ye time of ther sycknes, thei might vnfainedly to reioyse in tribulatio~ and valea~tly to striue agaynste enemies, the slesh, the world, hell, syn, death and desperatio~.
wishe al the faithful in the of ther sicknes might haue this red vnto the~, ether of ther or of some other faithful christians: so shuld thei wtout al doubt exceding great co~forte, paciently thankfully beare the crosse that god laieth vpo~ the~, with glad hartes wyshe wyth S. Paule to be losoned fro~ this wretched body and to be with Christ in glory.
Farewel good Reder, pray that the Gospel of our health, whych is the myghty power of god vnto saluatio~ for eue+ry one that beleueth, may haue free passage emonge vs vnto the vtter subuersio~ of Antichrist his kingdom.
Pray also, that we may so lede our lyfes in al thinges co~formable to the wyl of god, that through our godly maners Christen co~uersation we may garnyshe beautifye the doctrine of our sauiour Lord Iesu Christ, to whome wyth the father and the holy ghost be al glory prayse and honour, worldes wythout ende.
THOV SHALTE Euer be at this pointe (o thou Christiane) which art sycke and dyseased, faithfulli to beleue that thy punyshement trouble cometh not vnto the by chauns or fortune, but by the appoyntmente, councell and sufferauns of God.
What syckenes, calamyte or myscry chaunchethe to the godly, all that come to passe at the appoyntmente, wyll pleasure of God.
For in hym we lyue, moue, and haue our beyng.
Nether shalte thou doubte, but that of a ryghte good and very fatherly mynde he sendeth the what so euer dysease thou hast, not to destroy the, but to call the vnto repe~tauns, and to exercyse, proue, trye, and store vp thy fayth.
For afflyctions are the sure sygnes vndoubted toke~s of Gods high mercy, and syngulare good wyll.
He scourgeth euery sonne, that he receyueth: that thy moste tender heauenly father, whyche so derely loueth the, accordi~g to his singulare good appointme~te, of an ernest bent good wyll towarde the, wyth thys thy aduersyte euen as it were wyth bondes doth plucke backe, refrayne, and mortifye thy olde man, that mayst crucyfye wyth Christe the gladlier more cherfully thi bo+dy offer it as a sacryfice: thys thy therfore, wherwith thou art vexed, is a fatherly chastysemente layde vpon the, not that thou shuldest be distroied, but that thou shul+dest be amended, quickened made a new man.
Paraduenture God the the father seeth, that thy olde Adam is fearse, stobborne, froward vnruly take his pleasure, liueth more licenciously the~ becometh him foloweth hys awn carnal affectes, can kepe hym selfe in no good order, therfore doth he cast thys as an halter vpon hym, snarle hym wyth thys fetters and chenes, spearethe hym in thys prison dengden, ouercometh hym with thys punyshment, that he may brydle him, knocke him downe and kepe him vnder awe, that he cast in to perell put in extreme ieoperdye thy most noble and precious soule: fleshe and bloude reygne and beare more rule in the, tha~ the spirit: here is god present with thy spirit, helpeth her stryuing against the fearse and rebellious flesh, that she maye ouercome, subdue and treade vnder foote the fleshe.
Yf that were in good health and in bodely prosperite now, paraduenture, the fleshe (as it is alway naturally disposed, and bent vnto deuyl) shuld deceyue the and cast the into many and greuous synnes agaynste God wherwyth God beynge dyspleased thou shuldest be in daunger of cursyng and dampnatio~: that thy heauenly father preuentyng this inco~modite and perell, and prouidynge for the and thy healthe, bryngethe vnder and kepethe downe thy fleshe, whych wyth all mayne and ferse waxeth woode against the spirit, and is euermore contrary to it, that it be not waloued forth into most stynkynge and fylthy pudle of synne, but be subiecte and obedyent to the spyrite: forasmuch than as this is the pleasure of thy mooste louinge Father, agayne seynge that all thyngesturne vnto thy co~modite wealthe, take hede dylygenlye (O brother) that thou doste not stryue agaynst the good wyl of God but, suffer pray the wyl of thy father may be done in the, that he may ha~dle the as he thinketh best, and that thou mayst not wysshe couet or desyre any thynge, but that he shall thynke good, that all thynges may turne to the glory and praise of god and that he maye assyste the wyth his grace, that thou mayst paciently and thankefully beare the crosse that is layde vpon the: for pacience bryngethe experyence, experyence bryngeth hope, and hope maketh not ashamed.
Here hast thou an occasyon to exercyse and lerne pacie~ce in al thi troubles.
Fyrst thou lernest that God of a fatherly minde punisheth the, and thys dost thou learne by experyence, for excepte thou dedyst proue in very dede, how health full it were to gyue ouer thy selfe wholly to God, to obeye hys wyll, (as Dauid saythe, it is hyghly for my profyt, that hast punished me) thou couldest not co~ceiue a certe~ and sure hope of hym, hauyng no experye~ce before that a mynde so fatherlye and wo~derfully desyrous of the hyghe hydde vnder thys crosse and rodde.
But seyng thou hast lerned that before by experience, and haste now some taste of that thynge, thou doste not despayre in any trouble, but thy hope encreaseth streyghtewayes, seyng thou hast before ofte~tymes prouedÂ· the helpe of God
And althoughe he wynketh at the matter, and sometyme suffreth the for a certen space to styke stand faste in the myre, yet at the laste he retcheth forthe hys helping ha~des, delyuereth saueth the: he suffreth the to swymme for a certayn space, yea to be ouerwhelmed wyth waters, but he sufferethe the not to be drowned.
Hereof mayste thou gather a sure hope, that he wyl neuer leaue the nor cast awai, seynge he hath preserued the beyng so ofte in ieoperdye: in aflyctyons and trubles therfore dost thou lerne to conceyue and nouryshe a good and vndoubted hope of God, that euen in the moost greuous afflyctions of al, wher no helpe at all appereth, thou mayste truste vnto hym, beynge now thorouly taughte hys custome in deliuerynge and sauing hys people, thou haste lerned that afflictio~s be sent not of dyspleasure but of a Fatherly loue.
Whyche thyng thou beleuyng and hauynge experyence therof, doste pacyently abyde hys helpe, neyther dispayrest thou, but trustest stedfastly, that he at the laste wyll helpe the, although he delayeth it neuer so lo~ge, hydeth and kepethe hym selfe secrete.
And thus at the last dost thou know and vnderstand that thi disease or trouble is not se~t vnto the for this purpose that shuldest be destroied, that the glory of God maye be sette abrode, that al thinges may turne vnto thi health saluatio~: he can giue him selfe ouer wholly co~myt him selfe to god on this maner, and put al his trust in his pro+mises, truly that man neuer dyeth: whych thyng Christ him selfe euen wyth an ooth, because we shuld not doubt, affyrminge the same, sayeth, Uerely, verely, yf any man kepe my worde, he shall neuer se death.
am the waye, the truth, and the lyfe: he that beleueth in me, shall lyue, although he be dead.
And he that lyueth, and beleueth in me, shal neuer dye: these wordes of christ (o brother) loke that thou depely repose the~ wyth al diligence kepe them in thi minde, and wha~ soeuer perceiuest minde wauer or is vnderprope lyft it vp wyth this swete and comfortable sayinges: he that beleuethe in Chryste, shall not taste deathe: he that beleueth in me, hath euerlastyng lyfe, sayth Christ: this is euer lastyng lyfe, to knowe the euen the true God, and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ.
Euerlastynge lyfe is begunne in this worlde: for he that hath Christe, hath the true lyfe, for Chryst is lyfe: he is also the truth therfore wil not he mocke vs, butal the {pro}mises of god ar in hi~, ye ar in him Ime~.
And that shuldest doubt nothyng, but that God wyll abyde by hys promises, he hath bonde him selfe vnto the wyth a certen peculiar couenaunte and sygne put vnto thy body.
For when he being gratly desyrous of thy health sente hys sonne in to the worlde to offer hym selfe vnto the deathe for thy sake, he ded make and stryke vp a barge~ of grace before christ, in who~ he hath promysed, yf thou wylte beleue and be Baptysed, that he wyll gyue the euerlastynge lyfe frelye, and neuer forsake the, yea that he wyll be thy father, and crowne the wyth grace and mercy: thy baptysme is a sygne of thys couenaunte.
Now is it necessari for the, that thou cleuest with tothe and nayle to the promyses, whych are added to thys sygne.
For God hathe gyuen thys sygue, that thou shuldest nothyng doubt of the grace or fauoure that he hath promysed, nor yet of hys fayth concernynge the faythfull perfyrmans of the same: thou arte baptysed to dye wyth Christe, as Paule saythe, that hys death shulde be thy death, and that he shulde puryfye all thynges for thy sake, yea thou hast put hym on in babtisme, that thou shuldeste be whole in hym, and he in the.
Baptysme therfore is a couenau~te, whych lyfteth vp, chereth and maketh quyet thy conscie~ce before god (as Peter testifieth) that he wyl neuer dampne the for thy synnes.
For thou beynge iustified by fayth, hast peace wyth God: a quyet, clere, and pacifyed conscie~ce is the true peace Thou hast perceyued a moost sure sygne as a certen seale of thys iustification and remission of sinnes, Baptysme, that thou shouldest beleue for a certente, that God for Chrystes sake wyll haue pytye on the, preserue and delyuer the.
Nowe seynge than that God the, and wyll be thy father and neuer forsake the, seynge also that thou haste an vndeceauable sygne and of this thing, loke that thou dost commyt and wholly giue ouer to hym bothe thy selfe and all that euer perteine vnto thou must also obeye hys wyll, and pacientlye suffer hys hande, whether he wyll that thou lyue or dye, that his wyll, whyche is euer best, maye be done vnto the glory prayse of hym, althoughe it be impossible, that shuldest be dampned, yf thou doste faithfully trust on the mercy which he hath promysed for Christes sake and consecrate thy selfe wholly to him, obeynge his moste godly wyll in al partes.
For he hath promysed, that he wyll be thy father, and forasmuche as he is true, when thou knoweledgest hym to be thy father, and dost hope and loke for all good thinges of hym, he can none otherwhyse but be thy father and saue the, although he ha~dle the for a certen tyme neuer so hardly.
Seynge tha~ that he hath promysed to be thy father, and thou dost truste on hys {pro}mises, wythout doubt he wyl care both for the and thyne at all tymes: wherfore thou shalt co~mend to him not only thy body, but also thy wife and chyldren, thy kynnesmen and frendes, to be shorte, all that euer thou haste, and doubte not but that wyll be a true Father, a true husbande, a true kynnesman and fre~de: for he hath hytherto vsed the in these thynges only as a stuward and dyspensatoure: But now seyng he is mynded that thou shouldeste leaue of the functio~ and vse of thys offyce, he wyll appoynte another in thy roome, whyche lyke a good stuwarde shall both faythfully and dilygently loke vpon them.
Yf thou hopest thys thynge of hym, and lokest for it wyth a ful trust of harte, it is no doubte, but he wyll do that haue spoken: wherfore put out of thy mynde, all sorowfull care of worldly thynges, and commende it to God.
Rather take thoughte for thy selfe, how thou mayste prouide for thy soule, and sende that vnto God.
And seynge that God hathe forgyuen the all thy synnes frely for Christes sake, he requireth nothing at all of the, for thys exceding great and in estimable benefyte, but that thou shuldest agayne forgyue euen from the very harte them that haue done the wronge: for he promysethe that he wyll forgyne vs our offe~ces yf we forgiue men ther offe~ces, therfore when thou haste forgyuen all offences euen from the very harte, yea and that so, that thou neuer remembreste them afterwarde, praye also for them that haue hurte the ac+cordyng to the doctrine and of Christe, yea and yf euer thou recouerest, helpe so muche as lygheth in thy powre them that haue nede of thy helpe.
Yf that thou hast a mind voyd, of dissimulation, preuy dyspleasure, enuy, malice, yll wyll and wrathe, thou haste also a sygne and earnest token that God hath forgyuen the thy synnes: for fayth wherwyth thy harte is puryfyed, stretchynge out her selfe, and bryngynge her fruites for the infynite benefites of God can none otherwyse then forgyue agayne and to do well to her neyghboure.
Thys fruyte of charite beareth the witnes and maketh the sure, that thy fayth is true and lyuishe, seyng it bryngeth forth true and good fruytes: Thys meaneth Peter, wher he commaundethe that we shulde make our vocation and election fyrme sure with good workes, for he signifieth and plainly meaneth, thys workes ar testimonies and sygnes that thou arte electe of God, and purchased to be hys sonne vnto the ioyes of euerlasting lyfe.
Nether is ther any cause (o brother) that god shulde forgyue the thy sinnes, for the greuousnes of thy dysease crosse: for ther is none other satisfaction, none other reco~pense for thy synnes, than the onely deth of Christ.
God beholdeth none other thynge in this cause he accepteth none other thing here than his only begotte~ son: he is la~be of god whyche taketh awaye the synnes of the world: He is the sacrifice oblation sufficient, absolute and perfect for the synnts of the whole worlde: thy disease paynes ca~ not satisfye before God for the lest syn that thou hast co~mytted, muche les are they able to deserue health euerlasting saluatio~, as Paule testifieth, saying do not thynke that the of this lyfe are worthy of the glory which shalbe shewed vpon vs.
No creature nether in heuen nor erth, no a~gel was able to apease, mytigate swage the wrath of the father, much les shal this thy disease short trou+ble pacyfye it.
For he that shulde aswage that wrath and reco~cile God to man, he muste nedes be both god and man, seynge he muste be an intercessor and aduocate betwen god being angry and man condemned.
Therefore was it conuentente for the sonne of god to become ma~, that he apease the wrathe of God the father by sufferynge paynes in hys awne body, and so preserue vs from it, as the Prophet testyfiethe, sayinge: He hath taken vpon hym our dyseases, and borne awaye our sorowes.
God hath layde vnrighteousnes of vs all on hym: For the wickednes of my people haue stri+ken hym.
Aud Peter saythe: By hys strypes were we made whole: therfore for thys Christ thy Lord are thy synnes forgyuen the, and for none other thynge neyther in heauen nor in earthe, not for thy good workes, nor for any afflyction, although neuer so harde and bytter, Christe is our only ryhhteousnes, healthe, redemption satisfaction: God made hym syn for vs, whych knew no syn that we myght be made righteous: wherfore yf thou beleuest, thou arte the sonne of God al redy: yf thou be the sonne of God than art thou also the heyre of God, and fellowe enheritoure wyth Christ: yf euerlasting lyfe be enheritaunce and the gyfte of God, as Paule calleth it, certes then shalte thou not deserue it wyth the sorowes of thy dysease: but God wolde haue the punyshed with this sicknes, that thou myghtest represse breake, restrayne and mortyfye thy olde man, that it maye ones cease to synne, that shall come to passe at the laste by the deathe of the body.
And for this cause must we dye, that our soule may departe hence vnto euerlastyng saluation: for thys death is a gate and entrauns vnto eternall lyfe, ther at the laste are we delyuered from al wretchednesses, miseris carefulnes, dysquietnes, from al erroures and iuglynge castes of the dyuill, neyther shall we any more be defyled wyth the moost stynkynge fylthynes of synne, neyther shal we be seduced and led awaye into heresys or erroures, nor yet be throwne hedlonge into desperation.
For an ende of all euylles, aduersities and inco~modities is then come, yea the~ shal we rest in the Lord and enioye eternall lyfe and pleasure wythout ende.
Death therfore is not to be ab+horred nor feared, yea it is rather most feruently to be desyred, seynge by that we passe hence vnto eternal ioyes.
Uery true is whych Paule sayth, to the godly all thynges worke for the beste: Death in the syghte of the worlde is a thyng of all thinges moost odyous, mooste hatefull, most lothsome and moste horryble, yet to the faythfull it is most swet, most acceptable and most pleasau~t.
And although it be so, that our Adam tre~bleth at it, excheweth and abhorreth it, yet the inward man redy and wylling to suffer it, for asmuche as he perceyueth knoweth that by it he is delyuered frome all fylthines of syn, vice, wretchednes and departethe vnto euerlastynge ioyes.
Â¶How they are to be comforted, whyche are in parell of death.
THE best God and thy most louing father hauyng pytie on the (o Brother) calleth the from thys most wretched miserable lyfe, wyllyng to remoue the vnto him, and to cary the into perpetual ioyes of the heaue~ly life.
Ther+fore yelde, gyue ouer co~mende to hym wholly thy selfe, all that euer thou hast, what so euer hys wyl is lette thy wyll be thesame, and saye, lette thy wyl be done father God, and not myne: cry vnto Christ with the thefe fastened to the crosse, reme~ ber me, Lorde, when thou comeste into thy Kyngdome: erye wyth the Publican, Lorde be mercifull to wretched synner cry instanstly with that earneste woman the Cananite, sonne of Dauid haue mercy on me.
Yf thou cryest thus, Chryste wyll heare the, doubte not, he wyll haue mercy on the, he wyll forgyue the thy synnes, yea thou shalte be wyth hym in paradyse: therfore lay hande on thys Christe, cleue to him wyth tothe and nayle, commyt thy soule vnto him: cry wyth this christ crucifyde vnto God the comon father, Lorde my truste is in the, let me neuer be putte to confusion, but rydde me, and delyuer me thorowe thy ryghteousnes: Bowe downe thyne eare vnto me, make haste to delyuer me.
Be thou my God and stronge holde (wherunto may alwaye fle) that thou mayst helpe me, for thou arte my strenght and refuge: thou art my defender: Into thy handes co~mende my spirite: crye also wyth Dauid: Lorde thou art my strenghte, my sure holde, my refuge and my delyuerer.
my God thou art my helper, my defe~der, and the horne of my health and my protection.
Unto the Lord, lyfte vp my soule: my God my truste is in the, let me not be dryuen to shame: dyrecte me in thy truth, thou art the God my sauionre, Reme~ber, Lord thy tender mercies, and thy pyteful compassions, whiche thou hast euer vsed: Remember not the trespasses of my yonghe: Accordynge to thy mercye remember me for thy goodnes sake: for thy names sake (o lord) forgyue my synne, for it is muche: loke on me, and haue pytye on me, deliuer me from my necessities: forgyue me all my offenses kepe my soule, and delyuer me: Lette me not be put to co~fusion for my hole trust is in the.
Yf on thys maner thou wylte call for the helpe of God with and hole hart, god wyl surely the in tyme conuenient, and he wyll say vnto the that, whyche is in the Psalme.
Forasmuch as he hath put his trust in me, wyl delyuer him: wyll defe~de hym because he hath knowen my name: He hathe cryed vnto me, wyll fauorably heare hym.
am wyth hym in hys tribulatio~: wyll delyuer him glorifie hym.
Wherfore (o thou Christiane) fyght here a good fyght, stryue valeau~tly with a good corrage, as it becometh a true christea~ man: take hede, geuest not ouer, take hede, thou turnest not thy backe: ther is no daunger thou stryueste not here alone, but Iesus Christ the kyng is thy guyde in thys agony, thys thy guyde captaine shal be thyn auen ger, in this battel he shal defende and delyuer the fro~ all the enemyes of thy soule, fro~ all perell from all misery and wretchednes: folow this captayn goyng before the in this co~+flicte and battell: he is a kynge not like to other but of an exceding and infinite powre: he hath alredy ouercome and throwne vnder the foote for thy sake: death, Satan and hell death is swallowed vp into victory Christ dyed for the: Therfore euerlastyng death hath no power in the Christ went down for the vnto hel, that he myght deliuer the from this euerlasting darknesses therfore be on a lustye and mynde, and wyth a valeau~te courage brast into the army.
Put awaye all feare, ther is no daunger in thys behalfe: ther is no cause why thou shuldest feare the fearce and streyghte iudgement of God.
Christe Iesus is a mediatour before God, the same is an aduocate, yea and thy Patrone, defender, Byshoppe and Preeste: He hathe reconcyled the to God, and hathe restored to the hys fafatherly mynde, whych before was estraunged from the for thy sinnes, God for Christes sake is nowe thy father, he taketh charge of the, he entierly loueth the as his most tender sonne.
Nowe seynge that so noble a kyng sta~deth on thy syde, who shall putte the to any busynes, who shall be bolde to assayle the or ones fyght agaynst the? who pray the, shal do the any wronge? what dau~ger ca~ ther be? heare Paule: Yf god be on our syde, sayth he, who can be agaynst vs? whyche spared not hys awne son, but gaue hym for vs all, how is it possible, that wyth him he shoulde not gyue vs all thynges? who shal lay any thyng to the charge of Gods electe? It is God that iustifieth, who is he that ca~ condem+ne? it is Christ that dyed, yea whych rose agayne, whyche also is at the right hande of god, and maketh intercession for vs: Who shall vs from the law of? God am sure that neyther death, nor lyfe, nor nor depenes, nor any other creature can seperate vs from tha law of God, whych is in Christ Iesu oure Lorde.
Therfore seynge that Christ is gyuen, to the wyth all that euer he hathe, so folowethe it that hys ryghteousnes, innocency, health and euerlastynge lyfe is gyuen to the, as Paule wytnesse the, sayinge.
Christe is made of God oure wysdome, ryghteousnes, sanctification and redemptio~.
Therfore putte all thy hope, truste and confidence in thys Christe, whyche is the heade cornerstone.
Thys stone is a valeaunte, stronge, stedfaste and sure fou~dation, wherunto thou mayste safely truste and commytte thy selfe.
No tempest although neuer so blacke and horryble, no showers, no stormes ca~ shake and topple euer thys foundation: In thys Christe, saye, let all thy hope and confydence be sette.
Caste thy selfe wholly on hym, yelde thy selfe altogyther to hym, cleue to hym wyth stronge fayth, let no trouble or te~ptation plucke the fro~ him, although all thynges seme neuer somuche to the go to hauocke, althoughe and bloude yell the neuer so muche the contrary, and reason thynkethe farre otherwyse, yea althoughe th
Deuyll sometyme whysper in thy mynde that thou arte vtterlye vndone, that God is an extreme enemy vnto the, and that thou haste deserued the punishment of hel fyre, and therfore thou must nedes be da~pnedÂ· For faith is a sure confidence and lokynge for of thys thynges that are to be hoped, that is to saye, promysed, and a and euyden knowelege of those thynges doo not appeare wyth that holy Patriarche Abraham thou must beleue vnder hope agaynste hope: thy faythe and hope muste nedes resyste and set them selfes agaynste all those thynges, whych euer blinde reason dothe Imagyne, or that mooste sutle, and craftye enemye doo brynge to remembauns and worke agaynste the: wherfore thou muste thoroulye learne what cutme, God dothe kepe in sauynge hys: whome he wyll lyfte vp into heauen, hym he bryngethe downe fyrste vnto Hell: Whome he wyll hym dothe he fyrste kyll, vpon whome he wyll exercyse hys excedynge Mercye, hym wyll he fyrst trye, and make asthoughe he woulde dampne hym.

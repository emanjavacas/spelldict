a brief description of the true prophets and the false and how false prophets and may be known by a letter to priest hill

priest hill

thou who professes thy self to be a minister of christ thou art found to be an antichrist and a false prophet and art a a raging wave of the sea foaming out thy own shame as those spoken of in jude
and thy fruits also maketh thee manifest and thy folly and ignorance were abundantly discovered and made manifest at the meeting at twycrosse on the second day of the week and the
day of the
month and could give no account at all of any thing of the working of god by inward experience for when propounded a question to thee and asked thee concerning passing from death unto life thou could tell nothing of it at all and because it is said that death reigned from adam untill moses over all those that sinned not after the similitude of adams transgression and the law and the prophets are till iohn and iohn he came and doth come burning and shining amongst those that were born of women was not a greater than iohn yet he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he as it is written then asked thee how thou couldst give account of those ministrations in the inward man and thy passage in the inward ministration through death and withall asked thee what death had reigned over in thee and thou could not tell also asked thee how it was with thee in deaths reign and how thou came thorough the ministration of condemnation and to know the law and the prophets fulfilled in thee and to what and how thou came to iohns ministration to know the fallow ground ript up in thee and the ax laid to the root of the tree what the

tree and the ax and the fallow ground was and how the burnings and the shinings came and how that ministration ceased and what succeeded and exceeded but thou could give no account of them and the devill in thee raged thou being in union with him fret and fumed and were like one of the buls of bashan that is spoken scripture and told thee thou ought to give me account with meeknesse and fear because it was required of thee so to do for the minister of christ saith sanctifie the lord god in your hearts and be ready alway to give an answer to every one that asketh with meeknesse and fear pet

but hou shewed thou knew not the fear of the lord that were so with rage fury mnesse mischief and wickednesse lying and false accusing of the just and could prove none of those things wherein thou so falsely accused the innocent
oh shame upon thee priest hill that art such a man of beliall the light of god in thy conscience will prick thee at thy heart for it and thy contrary acting to the light and that light which sheweth thee sin and evill and checks and reproves thee in secret that light will be thy eternall condemnation who hateth it and acteth contrary to it and the light of god in thy conscience will witnesse for me and the truth against thee and thy deceit in thy condemnation thou wilt know what say oh shame let shame cover thy lips who hateth light and acteth so contrary to it and all that fes god that knoweth thee may cry shame of for ever thou enemy of all righteousnesse and child of the devill who preaches up sin and a continuance in it to uphold the devils kingdome and so perverts the right wayes of the lord as thou dost scripture which thou brought in the acts shall stand for thy elf for when charged thee to prove me to be that which thou accused sme of thou could not but shall prove thee to be a lyar and a false prophet as said and so make it good and prove it both by thy fruits and also by scripture to confirm the same as said
first when asked thee if thou did not preach for hire thou denied it openly and before the people and said thou did not preach for hire then secondly asked if ther were none present there that could witness against thee in that thing to prove thee lyar whereupon in that place witnesse came against thee and proved thee a lyar before thy face and lying is of the devill iohn
and all are for lake read thy reward thou lyar and child of the devill rev

then when thou was proved an open lyar in that thing thou proceeded further to manifest thy lyes and said thou did not preach for hire thou preached for souls and when it was asked thee and priest whetstone both of you what the soul was thou answered positively and said no man living could tell what the soul was whereupon there proved thee a lyar in that thing and withall asked thee and you both what you did minister unto and watch over that knew not the soul therein thou and he both did discover your selves to be no ministers of christ nor

the gospel for the ministers of christ in the new covenant did an doth watch for the souls as they that must give an account unto god hebrews

here hill charge thee and whetstone also in the presence of the living god to be ignorant of god and of christ and to be no ministers of the gospel nor the new covenant but are false prophets of rome and never was sent by the lord that knoweth not what the soul is as thou then said and therein thou lyed again and treebled thy lies that said thou preached not for hire but for souls and upon the examination said positively that thou nor no man living know what the soul was true thou knowest not nor none living in thy nature and deceivablenesse of unrighteousnesse
wo to thee thou lyer thou art of thy father the devill and a deceiver of souls iohn

fulfill the scripture where it is said in the last dayes there shall come scoffers which shall walk after their ungodly lusts pet
here thou wanton priest charge thee the red headed man to be no minister of christ but of and thou art without the fear of the lord as told thee and shewed that thou were yet taught of god and also thou shewed forth thy ignorance of the scriptures and art unfit to be a teacher of others who not the first principles or doctrine of christ for when he sent his disciples into the world he said unto them when ye come in an house salme it and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if the house be not worthy let your peace return to you again and whosoever shall not receive nor hear your words when you depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet for it shall be no more tolerable for sodom and gomorah in the day of judgement than for that city mat
and thou the young wilde priest thou that thou wert never taught of god nor sent of christ for if thou had thou could have received his doctrine and his messenger but thou shewed thy self like one of pharaohs fed and wilde horses without government or any humility or moderation at all and the minister of god exhorted young men to be sober minded and to let their moderation appear to all men but thou houldershaw had no sobriety nor moderation at all nor no solidenesse nor gravity temperance patience nor honesty nor stayednesse at all but were filled with laughter and folly and foolishnesse like a foolish wilde wanton youth without any government as thy deeds made thee manifest and the light of god in thy conscience will witnesse against thee though thy conscience be seared and the earthly part above where the deceit hath its passage like a high way ground where wildernesse and wantonnesse foolishnesse and giddinesse runs up and down and treachery and deceit hath its abode and lodgeth in the seat of darknesse where lust and accesse pride boasting lying scorn and disdain is the light that is within thy conscience will awaken thee and rip thee up one day and be a swift witnesse against thee and be thy eternall condemnation that hateth it and acteth contrary to it and contrary to the scriptures also which saith put away jesting with foolish talking eph but thou taketh delight in that which the scriptures forbids and acteth contrary to the light in thy conscience willingly and wilfully and rejoiceth in thy iniquity and in thy foolishnesse here charge thee again in the presence of the lord to be no minister of christ but of antichrist and thou art a servant of the devill and the light of god in thy conscience which checks and reproves thee in secret for sin and evil will witnesse against thee and greater will thy condemnation be thou lyer and wanton one thou scoffer and boaster proud foolish and prophane one thou servant of sin and enemy of righteousnesse thou serpent and viper how shalt thou escape the damnation of hell call not thou this railing for it is scripture language to the seed thou art of and to that nature thou art in and the light of god in thy conscience will witnesse the same as the book of conscience is opened and the scriptures beares witnesse against thee and all in that nature as thy fruits maketh thee manifest rom

do they not say that they are ministers of christ and do they not say that christ hath sent them
but they have no authority from christ neither are they approved of by him who do neither abide in his doctrine nor follow him for their example therefore are they false prophets that say and doe not they say that they are sent of christ but they do not abide in his doctrine neither do they follow him for their example and he that saith he is in christ ought himself also to walk even as he walked as it is written and witnessed iohn
but priest houldershaw and priest bennet and all the priests of the world and ministers of man walk contrary to christ and do no not abide in his doctrine as their fruits maketh them manfest
for christ was never proud neither

had he any mans person in admiration because of advantage but the priests of the world or ministers of man they respect rich men for their riches and disrespect poor men for their poverty and have great mens person in admiration because of advantage that they also may be great in the earth and be called masters and bear rule over poor people by their means as the false priests and false prophets did and they are exceeding proud therefore do they not keep the commands of christ nor walk as he walked but transgresseth and abideth not in his doctrine and so not god as it is written iohn and they say men should not be proud but they do not deny it themselves and so they are evill examples for they say and do not therefore are they false prophets mat to the end
the true christ was never covetous nor given to pleasures but the priests are both pruod covetous and men that followes pleasures and worldly vanities therefore are they not of christ and do not follow him for their example nor walk as he walked and they say men should should not be covetous but they do not deny it but love it themselves and so say and do not therefore are they false prophets and known by their fruits and they are vain and light and wanton and given to pleasures and so nourish their hearts as in a day of slaughter and kills and slayes the holy one and the just iames and the
hosea
the

but the true christ was a man of sorrowes despised and rejected of men isa
and so is he despised and rejected now by them and the priests that are as they are proud and covetous and light and wanton and vain as the two priests at thy house were therefore do they not follow the example of christ but they make the people light and vain as the false prophets did and as they do and as their fruits maketh them manifest and as may be red in ier
and the
and the people looking at them the priests or ministers of man for their examples and seeing them having mens persons in admiration because of advantage and seeing them proud and covetous and wanton and vain and given to sports and pleasures and seeing them sue and at strife and envy and hate and hearing them revile and speak evill of the wayes of godlinesse and seeing them given to disdain and laughter and vanity foolishnesse and folly
and they that are without the true fear of the lord are ready to look at them to walk after and they that fear the lord are despised by them

the people are ready to say within themselves if it was not right they would not do it professing themselves to be men of god and ministers of christ and say they know his minde and will as the priests say they do
therefore saith the people in their hearts if the priests or their ministers as they call them can do so as to be proud and covetous and sue and go to law and envy and hate and be at strife and variance and laugh and scoffe and sport and play and follow pleasures why may not we do so we do but as they do that are our leaders and if it was not right they surely would not do it for they know more than we do and if they do it we may do it
therefore are they evil examples and ignorant people are seduced and led into errour and wickednesse by them and taketh encouragement from them to do evill as they do and so the scriptures cometh to be fulfilled the leaders of the people

causeth them to erre as it is written isa
and again there is like priest like people as it is written and witnessed both by their fruits and by scripture hos and if the blinde lead the blinde shall not both fall into the mat
and if your understandings were enlightned you would see all the priests of the world to be out of the light and out of the truth as their actions declares and their fruits maketh them manifest and the scriptures beares witnesse against them and their deceiveablenesse with the light which changeth not are they and their pernicious wayes seen and comprehended and the light are they and all deceivers seducers false christs and false prophets and workers of iniquities from god and from christ to be condemned as it is written and witnessed and we to the wicked for it shall go ill with them isa

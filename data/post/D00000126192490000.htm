reader

there are many interests in this active age contended for the soveraign interest the kings prerogative the state interest the priviledges of parliament the popular interest the subjects liberty there is one above all these to be heeded the interest of the church as more excellent those civil this spiritual those the interests of men as men in their severall stations this the interest of the saints as saints those making for a politicall this for a spirituall those for a momentany this for eternall happinesse this the interest of christ himselfe who is head of his church aswell according to her visible and ministeriall as her invisible and saving state and therfore he alone it is who appoints her officers administrations lawes priviledges liberties in the grand charter of his word none of wch may the highest upon earth without crimen laesae majestatis attempt against the crown of christ to violate

neither is this onely excellent above the rest but most advantageous to them it is not onely the piety but the true policy of kings parliaments and people to give due heed to the setling of this which setled truly settles all theirs surely and beautifully
be wise now therefore ye kings be instructed yee judges of the earth kisse the son
nay the obtaining of the kingdome of christ in the world in all its claims shall renew the face of the whole creation and make a new heaven and a new earth
it hath been my endeavour in the integrity of my heart so far as have obtained mercy to discern that deceitful piece to enquire into the true state and order of the visible church of christ and if may to bring something if but a little goats haire towards the setting up of the sanctuary one thing have labour'd hope not unuseful to bring down the enquiry particularly to our condition in this nation that we might distinctly consider what after so many engagements to the lord by his great works for us by our solemn covenant with him lies upon us to practise
no more only have if thou beest faithfull thy prayers if ingenuous thine indulgence where thou shalt finde slips
thine in the service of the gospel ric resbury
the heads of this ensuing discourse are these eight propositions or instructions following
the true matter of the visible church is visible saints onely
ii
discipline is an ordinance of christ for ordering the visible church in her several congregations
iii
to the people of the church it belongs by divine right to chuse their officers
iv
christ hath committed the power of discipline not to the officers alone but to the church that is to the officers with the brotherhood

there is a formally distinct from the civil
vi
that bishops in office above presbyters are no church officers of divine institution it is pleaded by jerome from scripture and the highest
vii
to a particular congregation of visible saints

furnished with officers it belongs to exercise all parts of discipline within it selfe
viii
to a congregation of visible saints not yet possest of officers it belongs to possesse themselves of them

the first instruction
the true matter of the visible church is visible saints onely
by visible saints we understand with bucer those in whose conversation the necessary signes of regeneration appear
for clearing this
we do not mean that the regeneration of the person can be certainly concluded from such a conversation as we here require because the heart within may not be answerable therefore an hypocrite not discerned may be the true matter of the visible church

but our meaning is that the conversation must be such as if the heart be answerable it is certaine the person is regenerate
to cleare this further by instance
not only such as are commonly granted scandalous are here shut out in whose conversation as sin reignes so in their heart for ought that may appeare at the least but such also as we commonly call meerly civill honest men because though their hearts be answerable to their conversation yer are they strangers to regeneration the proposition thus cleared we come to arguments to confirme it


to be visibly of the church is to be visibly abrahams seed to be visibly abrahams seed is to be visibly of his faith and to be visibly christ's gal

abrahams flesh was to the jewes the visible bond of the covenant but to the proselytes and to the gentile churches not his flesh but his faith

to be visibly of the church is to be such in the sight of men as they are in the sight of god who shall indeed be saved and therefore visibly beleevers and holy the people of all the promises of all the priviledges of the gospel therefore a justified a sanctified people a people adopted a people of communion with god and christ a people of new obedience a spirituall people
to be the visible church of god is to be visibly his temple visibly an habitation for himselfe by his spirit ephes

but such are only they who are visibly regenerate
the temple was built of old of polisht stones and costly timber it received only the clean the visible church now is his visible temple made up of lively stones into a spirituall house pet
to abide apart from the unclean that the presence of god may fill this temple of his cor

from the end of the visible church which is that god might have an holy people separate from the world enjoying all ordinances performing in severall congregations all solemn worship to him glorifying his name by the light of good works but only such as are visibly regenerate are in any measure fitted for these ends wicked men quite contrarily affected therefore as he is in no wise to be owned for a minister of the church who is no way fitted for the ends of the ministery but is manifestly contrary thereto so neither are they to be owned for members of the church who are qualified contrary to the ends of

from who were they that were received by the baptist and by the apostles such as being wrought upon by the word preacht to an holy profession forsaking false religions confessing their sins professing their faith and repentance desired to be solemnly received and that when the profession of christian religion exposed to great temptations in the world


for the baptist mat
it is a mean conceit at the best

to think such a confession then served the turne as was palpably a prophanation of the name of god as giving no apparant hopes of repentance let us hear the judgement of some the most approved and excellent expositors
calvin upon the place thus
this confession was a testimony of repentance that men may rightly offer themselves to baptisme the confession of sins is required of them otherwise the whole action was nothing else but an idle toying furthermore it is to be observed that who are here spoken of were persons come to years who we know are not to be admitted promiscuously of the church nor by baptisme to be entred into the body of christ till they have first been tryed
the same calvin upon acts
having witnessed of those there spoken of that they did indeed testify that they were throughly affected with the serious fear of god who did of their own accord confesse the crimes of their former life least by their dissembling they should inwardly nourish the wrath of god he addes concerning those who came to johns baptisme that by the confession of their sins they made profession that they were not feignedly entred into repentance
beza upon the same place viz matth

thus they are said by the jewes to confesse their sinnes who acknowledge themselves all manner of wayes to be sinners and seek for pardon from the mercy of god as dan


hence it appeares saith he that john admitted none to his baptisme but such as gave testimony that they seriously embraced the doctrine of the free remission of sinnes and such a like publique confession was required of the catechumens in the ancient church called by the name of exomologesis
piscator in his observations upon matth


speaks thus baptisme is not to be applyed to any of yeares till he have first made confession of his sinnes and of his faith in christ and further promise of an holy life all these did john require saith he of those that came to be baptized of him for the first it is cleare verse
for the second it is manifest out of the words of paul acts
where he saith john baptized with the baptisme of repentance saying to the people that they should beleeve upon him who was to come after john himselfe that is christ jesus
compare acts
for the third it is evident from

verse
of this third of matth which is particularly declared and applyed to divers kinds of life luke

thus we see these excellent men judicious and sincere in their generation gather'd no such shuffing conclusions from the history of johns baptism recorded in scripture as many of ours are wont to gather who plead the numbers recorded by john as an argument that he did and we may receive into church society all comers for further discovery here let us look into another scripture concerning john and those received by him together with the judgements of those excellent and true hearted divines upon the place the text of scripture is matth

and it shewes how they were affected at least apparently who came in so great numbers to be baptized of john compare it with luke
piscator here it shewes the effect of johns doctrine to wit that many embraced that doctrine with great zeale and so took the kingdome of heaven as it were by force
beza
the kingdome of heaven suffereth violence
they break into it as it were by a certaine force for this treasure of our heavenly father lies open as it were to all earnestly by every one to be laid hold upon which he might seeme formerly to have hid as it is unfolded rom
which compared with this text now in hand we are given to understand both how entrance into the kingdome of heaven is offered us to wit by the preaching of the gospel and how offerd it is received by us truly by force made upon our selves for beleeving and by the persevering heat of zeal
take it by force
beza againe they snatch it to themselves or they storme it a metaphor taken from tents or from some castle which is stormed by enemies breaking into it
so that fervent force of the spirit is signified by which the faithfull being transported are carried with earnest desire and endeavour unto eternal life
cabvin

there is no doubt but christ commends the majesty of the gospel upon this ground that it was sought after with the servent desire and endeavour of many for as god had raised up john to be the horald of the kingdome of his son so he put the efficacy of the spirit into his doctrine that it should pierce into the hearts of men and should kindle that their heat

he addes from these words of christ we learne what is the true nature and manner of faith verily that men do not coldly and overly agree to god when he speakes to them but that with an ardent affection they aspire after him and do as it were by a violent endeavour break through
bucer
the violent take it by force that is they who are so enflamed with desire of the kingdome that they cast life and all things behinde their backs so they may be made partakers of the gospel and citizens of the kingdome of heaven then he refers this place to luke
ads this people and these publicans who neglecting all things received with greatest zeale the word of god first by john then by christ and his disciples justifying god that is as well by free confession of their sins as with most earnest nor lesse acceptable embracing of offered grace both acknowledging and proclaiming god just and the justifier are those violent ones which make force upon the kingdome of heaven and by force take it and doth not a man seem to take that by force for which he runs the hazard of life by these we are taught that the treasure of the gospel befals not any but those who have sought it with most desire and even love to hazard and lose al things for it
thus bucer hence we see how in the judgement of these worthy lights in the church johns hearers were affected when by him received


for the apostles and those received by them
acts to the end acts
acts
read the places see calvin likewise upon acts where he thus shewes of how pure a constitution the visible church then was having observed it one fruit of the miracle that unbelievers affrighted with so remarkable a judgement upon ananias and saphira durst not contemne the apostles
he addes though luke ascribes not this onely to the miracles but rather comprehends all things together which might make for the encreasing the dignity of the church for so were all things ordered as that a certaine divine majesty shined among them for they differed no otherwise from others then angels do from men for there is in holy discipline and the sincere observation of godlinesse a secret kinde of majesty which awes even the wicked whether they will or not but we are at this day strangers to it nay by our prophane libertie of living wickedly we

render our selves together with the gospel contemptible
thus much for the fifth argument

from expresse command of the churches separation from the openly wicked cor
with the former verses
object
the wicked here are heathen and profest infidels
answ
the apostle urgeth in his expostulation
such a repugnancy in the churches communion with those wicked ones as betwixt light and darknesse righteousnesse and unrighteousnesse christ and belial that the church then may answer that part of the comparison which belongs to her be those wicked ones who they will she must consist of a righteous people

if the church must separate from them because darknesse unrighteousnesse then from those who are such in life whatsoever in word they professe being as evill in scripture account as such heathen and termed infidels or unbeleeving tit
worse then profest infidels tim

and those who have a forme of godlines and therefore in word professe the true god at the least
but deny the power of it guilty of open wickednesse are to be turned from tim


otherwise manifest prophanation of the name of god with a palpable lye john
should entitle to the great honour of the great priviledges thereto belonging and the visible church should be no temple refusing the unclean but a common inne for all commers a cage of unclean birds a sty for swine

many most abominable hereticks may in word professe the true god to whom yet it is granted generally that is to be denied
adde ishmael esau profest the true god yet they were not of the church


from the doctrine of discipline mat

the visible church is a brotherhood
if thy brother sinne and this brotherhood founded in christ john
but doth christ owne as brethren god as children any but such as are in some degree sanctified apparantly so that they may be apparantly owned

the duties by our saviour required in the exercise of discipline from any church member indefinitely cannot be expected from any other both here admonishing in the three degrees with aime at gaining a brother cor
it is required of the church that they be mourners when

any proves scandalous among them to the church of which the people are a maine part is the power of christ committed for casting out and delivering up to satan
in case of neglect hereof the whole lump is leavened viz the whole congregation is under guilt neglect here is a sin tending to the dischurching of churches rev
with all scandalous of the church familiar society is to be refused by every churchmember
such severity herein is required as cannot be exercised towards all scandalous with whom we must needs have commerce in this world
the scandalous within the church when any prove such are by the church to be judged
and put away
the end of all is to humble shame and recover the fallen sinner
now how can these things be expected from the church if wicked persons shall be allowed the matter of the church can they deliver to satan that are themselves delivered to him have they share in the power of christ who are themselves under the power of satan what is there in a company of wicked persons to humble and shame a wicked person how shall they act in any of their duties depending upon discipline who have no principles for it thes
if he that walks inordinately having been formerly received must be withdrawne from then such a one not yet received is not to be received and generally forasmuch as scandalous when in are to be cast out not in they are to be left out
they who confine all to the officers alone will here take offence that in following this argument we allow a share of that power to the people to that we shall speak more fully and purposely hereafter in due place


from the testimonies given to the churches in most of the epistles especially about the beginning as rom

phil
to
thes to the end
thes to
read the places so of those seven asian churches some very pure as smyrna and philadelphia so as no fault found with them others as ephesus pergamus and thyatira a very faire testimony of them both what they had beene and what in part they were though not a little lapsed but both against them and the other two most corrupt sardis and laodicea their dischurching is severely threatned except they shall

returne to a purer state
object
the apostle gives a faire testimony to the church of corinth yet were there many great enormities among them
answ
his testimony is to the church generally but with exception of such as walke disorderly in the church as appears in that

he requires the church to proceed in way of discipline against such so as in case they persevere in their evill course to cut them off from the communion of saints whence
it appears that in their admission they were not discovered such whence that which may hence be gathered is that a church rightly constitute is not presently upon her degenerating in many of her members to be forsaken but they so degenerating to be cut off
the retaining of such in the church involved the whole church in guilt and threatned wrath cor
and
so rev
whence we may lay down this conclusion such persons are not the true matter of the church the retaining of whom in the church makes evidently for her destruction but such are the openly wicked foul hereticks
however the church of corinth was by her false teachers first staggered out of the way in something of doctrine and thence grew remisse in discipline for a time yet it appears by their speedy and sound repentance cor
that they were generally and habitually a very holy people

from the practise of the primitive churches after the apostles times in two things it appears how choice the matter of the church then was


the all of their catechumens when any formerly heathen wrought upon by the preaching of the gospel professed their embracing of the christian religion renouncing their former folse worship and desired the church to take them into her care for their spirituall state the church accordingly took them into her care for instruction and edifying but did not receive them into her fellowship any further then to heare the word till they gave a good account both of their christian knowledge and christian conversation and that in time of greatest persecution and all the time that they stood thus upon tryal and under instruction rending to prepare them for admission they were called catechumens when after a certaine time of tryall they moved to be admitted into church fellowship they were called

competents or desirers when they were admitted it was by baptisme and then were they compleat members of the church and called the faithfull this was one sort of catechumens another sort there was the children of christian parents who having been in their infancy baptized yet when they were grown to years they were under the churches instruction and tryall just in the same manner as the former and held the place and name of catechumens till they were for knowledge and holinesse of conversation approved experimentally by the church then upon their desires they were received into by solemne imposition of hands and so admitted to the lords supper and brought under discipline and were now compleat members of the church this imposition of hands being grounded upon heb
whence by the corruption of popery it degenerated into that spurious ordinance of confirmation as they called it


their severity towards the lapsed it is well knowne to all acquainted with the manner of the church in those times that as they diligently cast out the scandalous so they stood upon strict termes with them before they would upon their profession of repentance receive them againe this together with the state of those times considered times of great persecution it may be gathered that they received only such into as whom they might conceive so principled· as to prefer the truth and purity of gospel profession to their own lives
let us here sprinkle some few testimonies found in the fathers of those times touching the purity of the church in the matter of it
tertullian in his apologetick
alledgeth pliny an heathen under trajan an heathen emperour about a hundred years after christ giving this testimony to the christians generally that besides their stiffe refusall to sacrifice he found nothing in their religious worship but that they had meetings before day to sing to christ and to god and by mutuall agreement to constrme discipline and that they forbad murder adultery fraud treachery and other wickednesses the same father who himselfe lived a little more then two hundred years after christ he is much in challenging the persecuting powers to make good any of those crimes which they charged upon christians as atheisme incest treason chargeth

them that they warre with the name of christians that an innocent name in innocent men is by them hated and persecuted

in the ohapt of his apologetick thus we are a body made up of the conscience of religion of the unity of discipline of the covenant of hope then speaking of their worship in the publique assembly he addes for discipline there likewise are exhortations castigations and divine censures for with great weight is judgement past as among those that are certaine that the eye of god is upon them and it is the greatest of the judgement to come if any one shall so offend as that he is cast out from the communication of prayer of assembling and of all holy commerce
he mentions in the same chapter the love of the christians to be such one towards another that the heathen were wont with indignation to say of them behold how they love one another and are ready to die one for another
in the
chapt of his apologetick he shewes how they bore not with any of evill conversation comparing the christians with the philosophers
the philosophers saith he have an apish affectation of the truth and by their affectation corrupt it as hunting after their owne praise
the christians necessarily desire it and performe it intirely as providing for their owne salvation he adds a little after this objection but some of ours depart from the rule of discipline to which he answers they are no longer owned for christians by us and he reproves it in the philosophers that such among them as walk not according to the rules of philosophy are yet called by the name and have still the honour of philosophers
in his book to scapula who was a under the romane emperour and a persecutor he gives this character of the christians besides their unshaken piety towards god refusing the heathen sacrifices against the greatest torments we defraud none we adulterate the mariage of none we handle orphans religiously we relieve the needy to none do we render evill for evill let them who bely our profession look to it that is they who in word professe themselves christians but walk not accordingly whom we our selves refuse
who is there that complaines of us upon any other ground but onely that we are christians for so great innocency for so great honesty for righteousnesse for chastity

for faith for truth for the living god are we burned

in his book of repentance chapt

speaking of the necessity of sound repentance and that on the catechumens part before baptisme deny not saith he the divine benefit that is remission of sinnes to be altogether safe to those that shall go into the water that is that shall be baptized but that thou mayest come to that thou must be diligent for who will afford thee a man of such faithlesse repentance one drop of any water a little after let no man flatter himself that his ranck is yet but among the catechumens as though he might therefore take liberty to sin as soone as thou hast known the lord fear him as soone as thou hast beheld him receive christ one to the baptized another to the hearers or catechumens that laver is the sealing up of faith which faith is both begun and commended from the faith of repentance we are not therefore washed viz baptized that we may cease to sinne but because we have ceased because we are already washed in heart this is the first baptism of the catechumen entire fear
in his book of prescriptions against the hereticks he makes the promiscuous matter of the church the property of the hereticks
will not omit saith he the description of the hereticks conversation how frivolous how earthly how humane it is without gravity without authority without discipline such as agrees with their faith first of all it is uncertaine who is a catechumen and who is one of the faithfull they go together alike they hear alike they pray alike nay if the heathen should come among them in their assemblies they would cast that which is holy to dogs and pearls though no true ones to the swine their prostration of discipline they call simplicity our care of it they call an trimming they receive all promiscuously to the lords supper with them the catechumens go for perfect before they be throughly instructed
he chargeth it upon them that they are more in labouring for number then due matter
no where saith he are more easie termes then in the tents of the rebels where this very thing to be is to deserve
in his book of baptisme cap

he thus speaks
that baptisme is not rashly to be betrusted let them know whose office it is give to every one that askes hath its proper title belonging to almes
that rather is to be heeded give not that which is holy to dogs and do not cast your pearls to swine and lay hands suddenly on no man that thou beest not partaker of other mens sins

where by the way he interprets imposition of hands there to point at solemne admission of thus for some gleanings out of tertullian
the like we might observe from others as in cyprian who will have the church to consist of the ministery and the standing people and against what temptations did they then stand and for their communion they were most impatient of hereticks and all scandalous
in his
epist writing to cornelius then bishop of rome about such as having formerly fallen were now seeking to be againe received into the church thus he speaks for some their crimes are so much against them or the brethren that is the standing people do so firmely and stiffely resist that they can by no means be received with the scandal and danger of very if thou couldst most beloved brother be here with us when those evill and perverse ones returne from their schisme thou shouldst see what a do have to perswade our brethren the people to patience that they would having allayed their grief of mind consent to the receiving and taking care of the wicked for as they rejoyce and are glad when such as are tolerable and lesse faulty returne so on the other hand they murmure and contend earnestly when deplored persons and stubborne and such as are defiled with adulteries or with idols or such as are proud come back but will be no further tedious in quotations of this nature
if any man desire any further satisfaction let him read the last section of the sixt chapter in the three first centuries
magdeburg
concerning the conversation and discipline of christians afterwards in austins time when some would have it that the profession of the christian faith should entitle to baptisme though accompanied with a wicked life he writes a book entitled of faith and works proving such a profession to be as no profession


from the state of new jerusalem rev
from this and the last argument it is manifest that before the mystery of iniquity prevailed farre and after it shall cease the visible churches owne no scandalous sinners of their society the promiscuous state then of the churches in this degeneration is the outward court unmeasured and the holy city trod under foot by the gentiles
that voice then rev
calling the people of god out of babylon cals for the churches separation from

such this confusion now obtaining being one straine of popish corruption with popery beginning and ending
consectary
from this discourse of the matter of the church forasmuch as experience showes that in all nations where the gospell is preached yet the greatest part of men are manifestly wicked it cannot be according to rule that all the people of any nation generally should be accounted of the church though in word they professe the true religion which they know little of and care lesse for but in every nation and congregation or town a distinction ought to be kept betwixt the church and the world and the two sorts of catechumens ought to be some the children of the church and therefore baptized in infancy upon their due tryall when come to years received solemnely to as to the supper discipline others not the children of the church received upon due tryall by baptisme when come to years
this conclusion is further made good from the exercise of discipline cor
if all the nation generally be of the church then are all the scandalous of the nation generally the scandalous of the church but that they are not with all that are scandalous of the church we must refuse familiar society not so much as familiarly eating with them some peculiar relations here reserved and yet abide in the world but with all scandalous in the nation we cannot so refuse except we will go out of the world as the apostle there argues and experience to every impartiall and unblassed spirit abundantly makes it good

ii
discipline is an ordinance of christ for ordering the visible church in her severall congregations
we shall now briefly but yet so as to omit none that seem to have any weight in them endeavour the answer of objections


such as are generall as
that there were so many wicked among the jewes and yet that church was not to be forsaken answ
that ministration was more carnall and therefore a more carnal might then passe heb
as the gospell ministration is more spirituall heb
so that the gospell people may appear to be the people of that ministration they must in appearance be more spirituall

nor otherwhere for that time could be enjoyed god having confined it to that nation to that priesthood and that temple and therefore though their priests and people generally proved as great idolaters and persecutors as the church of rome this day yet the faithfull among them must there remaine to offer sacrifice and worship god but in the times of the gospel where any church turnes idolatrous and persecutors of the truth there is liberty otherwhere to settle purely

that people were holy in their admission

in abrahams family gen

in their nationall planting judg
hence that testimony given of them that they were planted a noble vine wholly a right seed jer

it was by rule provided for among them that none externally wicked should enjoy the mixture that was beside the rule and therefore no plea at all

none were circumcised but such as were externally holy their infants by descent from abraham being borne within the ministration of the covenant the flesh of abraham entitling that nation to the covenant and there was their claim to circumcision that they were that seed of abraham whatever their immediate parents were and they in their infancy had done nothing to make void that claime
the proselites that they might be circumcised must give evidence of abrahams faith and walk in his steps and then they being abrahams adopted seed their children had the same title to circumcision as the children of the jews
in the gospel churches there must be a visible descent from abraham according to the faith for right unto baptisme whether for our selves or seed baptisme being the seale of that covenant which blesseth all the nations of the earth in the seed of abraham by faith

thus they were holy in their circumcision

for other peculiar ordinances there was a threefold barre to such as were openly wicked

ceremoniall divers cases of ceremoniall uncleannes which debarred communion in the peculiar ordinances and they that were most carelesse of the holy things of god would oftenest be taken in these ceremoniall snares

judiciall the same covenant that entitled them to the church entitled them likewise to that land whence divers sorts of wicked persons were to be cut off from life not only blasphemers but idolaters nor only murthers but adulterers nor only traitors but disobedient to parents hence the whole nation enjoyned as in asa's time to swear a solemne covenant for seeking the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and all their soule and to performe it under penalty of death whether great or small whether man or woman chron

now had the judiciall law been executed according to divine rule partly so many wicked ones had been coct off and partly the rest had been so formidably warned that here had been a great prevention of that mixture in their

ecclesiastical ezek
difference to be made by ecclesiastical power as well betwixt the holy and prophane and those are morall termes as betwixt the clean and unclean which are ceremoniall termes a generall rule for this understood by the learned of ecclesiasticall cutting off numb
the stranger there the proselyte of the covenant further testimony to this rule that the openly wicked were ecclesiastically to be cut off is the ordinance of excommunication among them in the three degrees of it niddui cherem and
a thorow discourse about this for further satisfaction see in gillaspies aarons rod blossoming
thus much for this objection which is wont much to be stood upon but how sandy a foundation it is fit for so rotten a building as many endeavour to set upon it hope by this time appears
obiect

the parable of the tares matth
to the
and to the verse
answ
the field is the world
the good seed are

the children of the kingdome the tares are the children of the wicked one ibid these make the visible church in the world according to the minde of the parable both these are to grow together untill the harvest
what will hence follow that persons apparantly wicked must be received into and retained in the visible church this puts the parable upon the rack and forceth it to speak what it intends not

it warrants not the receiving wicked persons into the church


the husbandmmen were not so watchfull as they should have been when the enemy sowed these tares and it is the enemy not the lord of the field that sowes them

nor the retaining them then should our saviour here be against himselfe otherwhere where he hath appointed the ordinance of church censure for casting out such and that under so great a penalty as formerly we have seene matth

corinth

revel


if then the gathering up these tares desired by the servants
and forbidden by the master
be meant of ecclesiastical casting out these cares must not be the openly wicked but close hypocrites yet by some of the servants of more piercing judgements then others discerned the reason given may seem to favour this
they were such as were so hardly discerned from the wheat that there was danger of rooting up the wheat if these tares should be gathered up to this purpose jerome witnesseth that in those countryes there are certain tares so like to wheat in their first springing as hardly to be discerned from it thus cyprian understands it taxing the insolency of novatian who would not receive the lapsed againe into the church though they exprest never so much repentance how great arrogance is this saith he that he should think he can do that which our saviour granted not to the apostles that he should discerne the tares from the he will make himselfe the searcher and the judge of the heart and reins cypr
epist

but in casting out the openly wicked there is no danger of this


some think it not to be meant of ecclesiasticall casting out and therfore let the tares be granted for the openly wicked this parable gives them no place in the visible church

this gathering up the tares is their rooting up for that expression concludes

no lesse lest ye root up also the wheat with them
and therefore the final destruction of these wicked persons but church censure is not for destruction except of the flesh but for salvation of the person

this gathering up desired here by the servants and by the master for the present denied is that which shall be at the end of the world the finall destruction of the wicked
they shall not then for the present gather them up that is not knowing of what spirit they are call for fire from heaven against them
the like interpretation is made of the drawnet and the separation of the good from the bad gathered together by it
object

judas received the supper at least the passeover which was a sacrament and the sacraments belong only to those of the church
answ
if we shall hence conclude that the openly wicked have right to the sacraments and so are the true matter of the visible church

we must deny any such ordinance as discipline

by the same reason we must affirme that a minister of the church openly knowne to be such an one as hath his heart set to overthrow the gospel and betray the lord for money is to be retained in the ministery nay that such an one so knowne is to be chosen into the ministery for all this christ knew of judas therefore
judas his wickednesse was knowne to christ as god but not as man but for casting out of the church the offence must be knowne to the church in a church way that is by experience and proof
object

the apostles received such as offered themselves suddenly among the rest simon magus
answ
but yet upon such evidence as amounted in the judgement of rationall charity to the evidence of regeneration for this
consider upon what ground they offered themselves the word powerfully preached and mightily by miracles declared the word of god

what was the state of those times

they were times wherein according to former prophecies the spirit was plentifully powred out by the ministery of the apostles

they were times of great persecution of the christian faith nothing of outward advantage to move but all to the contrary to preach the gospel then among the jewes was as it would be now to preach the truth among the papists to

preach it then in the other nations was as it would be now to preach it among the turks
if upon the powerfull preaching the truth in the maine points of religion contrary to the maine popishand turkish tenets whereof they are most zealous such and such in the midst of the popish and turkish dominions should against manifest and great temptations openly embrace and professe the truth such a profession would amount to another kinde of evidence then is generally pleaded for from those examples among us

god for vindicating his name against scandalous profession put forth his revenging judgements against the deceitfull and hollow as in ananias and saphira's case whence many were much deterred from joyning with the church acts
thus for the state of those times
then thirdly consider what a faire profession simon magus made and for some time continued in which argues seemingly no small change acts
it is said he beleeved he continued with philip he was taken with admiration so ananias and saphira made a faire profession to sell their possession for reliefe of the church

when simon discovers his rottennesse then not till then peter perceived the wickednesse of his heart
and when he perceives it he professeth he hath no lot among them because his heart is not right
yet was not peter without hope but he might repent and something hopefull still doth simon appeare
and now the answer to this instance may cleare all other of the like nature
there is a fifth object

the scandalous mentioned in some of the epistles as in the church of corinth but this hath been answered before in the eighth argument and these are all the objections know that have any colour in them or at the least in the answers to these the grounds are laid for answering the rest
we come now
to peculiar objections respecting the generality of our people in this kingdome
object

we are all of the church by baptisme already
answ
from the beginning it was not so that all should be so promiscuously received therefore it behoves us to returne to the first patterne what right have they to baptisme for their

seed themselves having been baptized who had none for themselves were they unbaptized
ishmael and esau were circumcised yet afterward unchurched so were the shechemites circumcised many heathens in america baptized by the spaniard yet none of these ever of the church

to receive to baptisme for themselves or seed grosse ignorants who understand not the ground nature and end of that ordinance is
to make the service of god in so maine an ordinance an unreasonable service

to make up the visible church in her several congregations by an implicit faith

to admit the scandalous in like manner for themselves or seed is not to set the seale to the covenant but to passe it against the covenant

the reformed churches receive not to the lords supper and other priviledges of such as were baptized in their infancy but upon tryall of their knowledge and christian conversation which when approved they solemnely admit them understanding imposition of hands heb to point at the solemne admission of such
so calvin upon the place pleading thence for
reply
but children may have right by former ancestors
answ
visible administration must have visible grounds it must therefore upon particular evidence appeare to the church that such ancestors they had in whose name they may have right

how farre may we go back and where must we stop
offer such reasoning to thy prince will it passe for currant if thou shouldest claime the armes and honour of some noble family meerly upon this supposition that it may be some of thine ancestors were possessed thereof
such as could not finde their register for the line of the priesthood were as polluted put from their office ezra

this will prevent the distinction betwixt the church and the world and keep off for ever the baptisme of growne men

as for the children of wicked parents circumcised among the jewes this stone hath been removed before they had by abraham visible right under whom they fell
object

but all sorts among us have likewise received the supper
answ
but the greatest part besides the rule as is evident upon the same grounds now pleaded against promiscuous

baptisme

in the reformed churches when any member of one congregation transplants to another notwithstanding he hath received the supper formerly in the church whence he came yet doth the church to which he is come examine and approve him for knowledge and conversation before they receive him to the supper

how or by what right have the sacraments been ordinarily administred in diverse of our congregations where the word hath not been ordinarily preached from the doctrine of the matter of the church we may lay downe some further practicall conclusions

the saints are to separate from the wicked into

otherwise the church cannot be made up only of its due matter god cannot have his temple

the command is expresse for it as we have seen in the sixth argument the saints as expressely called to this as abraham out of caldea as the people of god out of babylon

to this separate communion belongs far greater blessings then to beleevers in promiscuous standing cor
generally whatever blessings belong to the visible church may be clearlyest expected and are most fully bestowed upon the church when most truly and purely setled in her congregations the presence of christ rev
his protection and defence and comforts isa
the power of christ cor
when we have spoken to the discipline we shall have further evidences of this conclusion

no person habitually scandalous is to be received to the sacrament though he humbles himselfe before the church till some time of tryall
he is not true matter of the church who is not habitually in the churches eye righteous
but the sacraments are peculiar
object
he that hears not the church is to be refused but he that hears her is to be received now he that humbles himself before the church upon her admonition hears her
answ
that rule if he hear not the church is concerning a brother one within matth

cor
but no person habitually scandalous is a brother as the doctrine of the matter of the church hath evinced


for a brother fallen into some scandalous sinne and humbling himselfe it follows not that he is not to be cast out therefore he is suddenly to be received he is neither to be suddenly cast out nor suddenly received to the sacrament but to stand under further tryall otherwise
will be turned into a meer mockery execution of censure against the most impudent for ever prevented who will quickly in appearance humble themselves if that may serve the turne such a course of discipline will in stead of humbling harden like the papists absolution upon their formal auricular confession and indulgences

for him in such a case to desire sudden receiving is scandalous an evidence that he is not humbled which if he were he himselfe would not venture so soone upon his own heart
object
matth

with luk
answ
it is a precept against revenge it is personal not ecclesiastical forgivenesse here commanded forgivenesse of the heart not of the court of an injury against me not of a sinne against god and even betwixt man and man this forbids not but a man may prosecute the law against the trespasser in diverse cases and yet from the heart forgive him and pray for him

conclus
hence the vanity of that argument used by some who refuse to joyne apart from the scandalous in a true way of and discipline to the pure all things are pure therefore the wickednesse of others defiles not me receiving the sacrament with them
answ
thy sin defiles thee and it is thy sin to keep off from the true way of the visible church
suppose in a setled church a person justly excommunicate thou shouldst defile thy selfe if thou shouldest receive with him because thou violatest the order of the gospel so here

the second instruction
discipline is an ordinance of christ for ordering the visible church in her severall congregations
mat
cor
thes
rev
tim

these scriptures perused shew us both that there is a discipline and what it is
for the nature and use of discipline together with the obligation lying upon christians in their places for indeavouring it shall gather something out of dr ames that excellent divine
medull


holy discipline is the personall application of the will of god by censures either for preventing scandals or for removing them out of the church of god

in the preaching of the word the will of god is propounded and really applyed for begetting and increasing of faith and obedience
in the administration of the sacraments the will of god is personally applyed by seals for confirming faith and obedience
in the exercise of discipline the will of god is personally applyed by censures for removing of sins which fight against true faith and obedience

this discipline is instituted by christ mat
and mat
and is therefore plainely of divine right neither may it by men at pleasure be taken away diminished or changed

nay he sins against christ the author and ordainer whosoever doth not what in him lies to settle and promote this discipline in the churches of god


the persons about whom it ought to be exercised are the members of the visible institute churches without any exception matth

cor
and no others verse
to all and onely those it belongs to whom it belongs to receive the sacraments
an institute church is a particular congregation of visible beleevers joyned together by special bond expresse

or implicite for exercising the communion of saints constantly among themselves cap


in those persons it hath respect to sinnes and scandals for it is an healing medicine for the wounds and diseases to which the sheep of christ are subject cor

because it doth effectually urge obedience to christ therefore not without singular reason a great part of the kingdome of christ as he doth visibly rule his church is by the best divines placed in this discipline
hence likewise the keyes and one of them is the key of discipline are called the keyes of the kingdome and the operations of this key binding loosing opening and shutting the kingdome of heaven have upon them the stamp of christs kingly authority

and this is the true reason why in so few churches the discipline of christ together with the doctrine is throughly setled and exercised because very many of those who will seeme to know christ and to hope in him do yet refuse to receive the whole kingdome of christ and to give up themselves altogether unto him

and as it is part of the kingdome of christ so by the same reason it is part of the gospel for it is an holy manner of promoting the gospel appointed in the gospel it selfe therefore they do neither receive the whole kingdome of christ nor the whole gospel who reject discipline

but because every part of the kingdome of christ is in its place necessary and that part especially which doth effectually represse sinne therefore we may not safely enough rest in those churches which want discipline except that publique want be made up by private care and mutuall watching


the parts of this discipline are two brotherly admonition
excommunication

which in case of repentance approved to the church is succeeded by absolution


brotherly admonition is to be exercised in case of any sin for which discipline is appointed as a medicine but after a diverse manner according to the difference of secret and open sins
in secret sins those three degrees are to be observed which christ prescribed in order matth
but in publike

sins those degrees are not necessary tim


full excommunication is not to be exercised except stubbornnesse be added to the sin matth

for the sinner duly admonished must needs either appeare penitent or stubborne the penitent is not to be excommunicate therefore onely the stubborn

when the matter may sufferdelay it is agreeable to scripture and reason that excommunication be begun by suspending from the lords supper and such like priviledges of the church which is commonly called the lesse excommunication

but in this degree we must not rest but repentance is by this meanes and in this space to be urged of which if there be no hopes we must then go on to a compleat separation from the communion of the faithful which is commonly called the greater excommunication

but because the stubborne sinner cannot be separated from the faithful except the faithful also be separated from him and this makes for the wholsome shaming of the sinner thess

therefore they who are justly excommunicate are to be shunned by all communicants not as to duties simply morall or otherwise necessary but as to those parts of conversation which are wont to accompany approbation and inward familiarity

from the bond of excommunication no impenitent person is to be loosed neither ought absolution to be denied to any penitent but it is not sufficient repentance for a man to say repent me will do no more except he otherwise make proof of true repentance but such tokens of true repentance ought to appeare that the church may be bound to rest in them otherwise hypocrisie is nourished and both the church and christ himselfe are mocked
from this discourse of discipline besides the nature of it appears


the weight of it binding to wrath or loosing from it retaining or remitting sins opening the kingdome of heaven to the penitent or shutting it against the impenitent casting out of the commonion of the faithfull cutting off from the body of christ delivering over to satan or readmission into the communion of the faithfull reimplanting into the body of christ rescue from their subjection to satan and so as all this done

here upon earth where rightly administred is confirmed in heaven

the necessity of it
standing upon so cleare a precept and institution of christ therefore being a gospel ordinance unchangeable
being so maine a part of the visible kingdome of christ as mediator

from the ends of it for reclaiming and gaining of offending brethren from deterring others from the like offences for purging out that old leaven which might infect the whole lump for vindicating the honour of christ and the holy profession of the gospel and for preventing the wrath of god which might justly fall upon the church if they should suffer his covenant and the seale thereof to be prophaned by notorious and obstinate offenders
chap
iv
the third instruction
to the people of the church it belongs by divine right to chuse their officers
that christ hath appointed officers in his church for the administration of the word sacraments and discipline we need not prove the confirmation of this proposition that the choyce of officers is the peoples right makes not a little for the due setling the church
for this shall do three things
point to the scriptures teaching this truth

adde some reasons according to scripture

give in the testimonies first of the primitive then of the reformed churches


for the scriptures acts
with
the disciples go as farre as is possible for man to have an hand in chusing an apostle who must have his commission immediately from god they appoint two and give forth lots acts
the whole multitude chuse their deacons and present them to the apostles for ordination acts
it is said of paul and barnabas when they had ordained elders to the churches the word translated ordained signifies solemnely to appoint to office upon the

peoples vote or choyce or suffrage so stephen in his treasure of the greek tongue renders it to make or create by suffrage
see calvin and beza afterwards

for reasons
the officers are given for the good of the church ephes

therefore she may in a certaine and ordinary way procure them which yet in many cases she cannot do if she have not right to chuse them

they are given to the church cor
therefore she hath a right to call them to her selfe if she depended upon either magistrate or patron or any other for a right to call her officers they were then rather given to them on whom she should so depend then to her

otherwise the church sc the company of beseevers should be in a worse condition then any society as to the setling of her selfe in her best state no people without rulers over them and officers for their good but may settle such among themselves as the experience of all shews
in this choyce of the faithfull is laid the foundation of greater love betwixt the people and their officers and so the ministry of the officers becomes more fruitfull

the faithful are to hear the true teachers to shun the false to try the spirits which imports
morall ability for chusing
a right of chusing or applying themselves to the true ministers add to these christian practise and experience what faithfull soule makes any scruple of leaving a faithlesse and unedifying minister at home to go abroad for enjoying a faithfull and edifying ministry which yet might not be allowed if christians had not a right to chuse their own officers

for testimonies
of the ancient church cyprian who lived a great light of the church about yeares more or lesse after christ is plentifull herein
as in the scripture testimonies it appears so in those times according to the scriptures and so in the reformed churches ordination of officers succeeded their election
hence cyprian to the presbyters deacons and all the people in the ordination of ministers most dear brethren we are alwayes wont to advise with you and to weigh the manners and merits of every one by common counsel epist

according to pamelius edition at the beginning
cyprian to the people to avoid the faction of felicissimus

and five presbyters siding with him speaking of them epist

they mindfull of their conspiracy my episcopacy episcopacy distinct from presbytery had then place in the church though of a far purer stamp then our prelacy· nay against your suffrage or election by vote and the judgement of god renew their old opposition he justifies his own standing by the peoples choice of him to the same purpose upon the occasion he speaks epist

cyprian to antonianus a brother about cornelius chosen bishop of rome by the people and the ministery
and novatian seeking to make himselfe bishop cornelius is thus justified that he was made bishop by the judgement of god and christ by the testimony of almost all the ministery by the vote or suffrage of the people then present here was the ministers testimony but the choice the peoples
epist

the same cornelius he justifies against novatian and that with the concurrent judgement of a councel assembled upon the same ground the suffrage of the ministry and people
epist
cyprian to the ministry of spaine
cyprian with his assembled praiseth the ministry and people of spaine that they had by lawful election placed sabinus and felix in stead of basilides and martial lapsed bishops we have here most pregnant testimonies and proofes of the peoples right in chusing

they when they had met together read letters out of spaine desiring their advice where in answer cyprian with the rest of the bishops first urging of how great it is that the minister or bishop be holy he thus speaks further wherefore it behoves that with full diligence and sincere tryall they be chosen to the ministery who are such as god may heare their prayers
neither let the people flatter themselves as though they might be free from guilt communicating with a sinful minister or bishop and affording their consent to the unjust and unlawfull episcopacy or ministery of him that is set over them
a little after therefore the people obeying the lords commandments and fearing god ought to separate themselves from a sinful church ruler neither mixe themselves at the sacrifices of a sacrilegious priest forasmuch as they have the greatest power

either of chusing the worthy priests that was the language of those times for bishops or ministers or refusing the unworthy which thing we see also to descend from divine authority that the bishop or minister be chosen the people being present in the sight of all and be approved worthy and fit by publicke judgement and testimony as in numb
adde levit

god commands the priest to be before the whole assembly that is he teacheth and sheweth that ordination of priests ought not to be but with the joynt knowledge of the people assisting the people being present either that the crimes of the evil may be discovered or that the merits of the good may be declared and it may be a just and lawfull ordination which hath been examined by the suffrage and judgement of all he still goes on which thing afterwards is observed according to divine precepts in the acts of the apostles when peter speaks to the people about ordaining a bishop in the place of judas acts
cyprian he understands those one hundred and twenty names the people of the church and makes use of this place for the peoples election he addes and we take notice the apostles observed this that not only in the ordination of priests that is bishops or ministers but of deacons also acts
which verily was therefore so diligently and warily done the whole people being called together lest some unworthy should have crept in he addes that it is most diligently to be kept from divine tradition and apostolicall observation which among them and almost throughout all the provinces is observed that for the right celebrating ordinations all the next bishops of the same province meet with that people to whom the ruler is to be ordained and the bishop being chosen the people being present we find observed by you saith he in the ordination of sabinus that the office of a bishop was conferred upon him by the suffrage of the whole brotherhood and the bishops who were present epist

this testimony is cleare and full for many things worthy our observation

that ordination was after election

that the people have right of chusing the highest officers in the church

that they have the greatest power of chusing or refusing

that they have right and it is their duty to separate themselves from such as having

been placed over them prove wicked

that all this is by divine authority

that they have the same right to chuse all

that this is the way to keep out the unworthy whence we may conclude the people owned for true matter of the church then were an understanding and holy people
pamelius in his annotations upon the place though no great friend to the peoples power here yet proves the presence and suffrage of the people for some ages after in africa augustines successors so chosen the same practice in greece in chrysostomes times in spaine in france in rome and this custome to have continued till gregorie the first nay till the times of charles and lewis emperours the like testimony from the first times of all immediately succeeding the apostles clemens romanus the same who is mentioned phil

writing an epistle to the corinthians and taxing a great schisme among them casting off some of their faithfull ministers he tels them it is an unjust thing to remove them from their publick ministry who had been placed by the apostles or after them by excellent men the whole church consenting or it seeming good to the whole church


for the testimonies of our reformers it is well known to be the doctrine of the reformed churches generally shal give an instance or two
calvin upon that word undefined span alphabet acts
they two saith he viz paul and barnabas created the elders but the whole multitude as it was the custome of the grecians in their elections declared with their hands lifted up whom they would have
so the romane historians speak many times the consuls who held the assemblies created new magistrates for no other reason but because they received the votes and moderated the people in their choice
institu

sect
againe paul and barnabas are said to chuse the elders do they this as a duty proper to them nay rather they permit the matter to the votes of all therefore in ordaining pastors the choice of the people was free but least any thing should be done tumultuously paul and barnabas have the leading plaes or rule them as moderatours and so ought the decree of the councell of laodicea to be understood which forbids the choyce to be left to the people
calv in acts
beza upon the same place this word translated ordained

but signifying as formerly we heard to chuse by hands lifted up ariseth saith he from the custome of the grecians who gave in their votes and suffrages with their hands stretched out and the force of this word is to be observed he still goes on that we may know paul and barnabas did nothing of their owne pleasure nor exercised any tyranny in the church
then maintaining his owne calling and the calling of the rest of the reformers to their ministry first he denies that ordination or consecration by imposition of hands to be lawfull which is used among the papists upon a double ground

because there was no lawfull choyce before it

because the ordainers among them deserve excommunication and in these two cases ordination is void by the canons they boast of
secondly he layes down the certaine notes of their call his owne with the other ministers of the reformation that they were approved of both for life and doctrine by the lawfull testimony of their churches that they were by them chosen and lastly with calling upon the name of god confirmed in their ministery
bucer
the holy ghost requires that they who are ordained to the holy ministery be first tryed and proved and so farre as is possible approved to all in the church and this he argues from the unfruitfulnes of the ministry wisely and not according to humane wisedome only but divine did leo bishop of rome write that no reason would admit that he that should take care of the church should not be both proved desired by that very paul considering viz how much it made for the fruit of his ministry labours so earnestly to preserve his love and esteem among the corinthians and to restore the same among the galatians
bucer of the lawful ordination of ministers
furthermore great care is to be had of this that those ministers may be given to the churches whom they may love esteem and honour and that this may be brought to passe no man at all is to be admitted to the sacred ministeries of the church who is not before religiously tryed and approved to the whole church where he ought to administer


in this tryall of those that are presented to the services of the church not only is this to be required who are made fit for

those ministeries by god but likewise that they may be acknowledged received and accounted such by the churches their tryall is so to be ordered and carryed thorough that it may be knowne and throughly beheld by the whole church to which any one is to serve who are to be received by them as given and sent of the lord unto them who are to be refused by them as not given and sent by the lord unto them and then he brings in that of cyprian formerly mentioned
epist

let these suffice for instance
object
but the people are ignorant irreligious and many wayes unfit
answ
for their abilities in learning for their judgement in the highest and mysterious most points and the like who are to be chosen they are by learned ministers where it may be to be tryed

there is a great use of the guidance and direction of able and approved ministers for ordering the proceeding in the choice that it be done with due care and peaceablenesse

the people of the church are not to be supposed ignorant irreligious they that are so are no true matter of the church nor to be owned as formerly this hath been proved this very right and duty of the people addes a further proof because it belongs to them to chuse their officers therefore they must not be such a people and in all these testimonies we find them supposed of another stampe

suppose that assistance of ministers cannot be had as in case god should enlighten with his truth a company of people in the midst of rome might not they by divine charter settle among themselves a ministery in other cases when the helpe of ministers cannot be had the reasons formerly given especially the first second third and fifth will conclude the peoples right without them
otherwise this would further ensue after a generall apostacy as that of the papacy though god should enlighten never so many people except withall he should enlighten some of their priests there must be an impossibility of

though such a concurrence of ministers where it may be had is for the help of the church as in the respects above named yet may they not devest her of this native right to put upon her any but whom she shall chuse and approve

it is true to a wicked people no true matter of the church

a minister may be sent to preach the gospel though they hate him so farre from chusing him but it is one thing to be a preacher to a people another to be their pastor and ruling elder in way of discipline only the saints visible combined are capable of pastorall and disciplinary interest
quest
how is this right of the people preserved to be judged by officers of their own chusing in the ordinary way of the classis when the sentence shall be carried against an whole congregation by officers of other congregations never chosen by them how was it not fairlier preserved in the way of primitive episcopacy all the people chusing the bishop and all the ministers

the fourth instruction
christ hath committed the power of discipline not to the officers alone but to the church that is to the officers and the brotherhood

there is in the church of christ a twofold power of order
office
the power of order ariseth from and belongs to the brethren so joyned together
the power of office ariseth from commission for rule and belongeth to officers set over the brethren

the power of order is to be exercised by the brotherhood whilest yet without officers and it is the power of chusing their officers formerly spoken to

to be exercised by the brotherhood together with the officers and it is the power of discipline in binding by admonition
withdrawing
excommunication
loosing or absolution
the power of order is here taken in a sense very different from that school use where it is distingushed from jurisdiction or rather against it
admonition in case a brother sinne scandalously withdrawing in case he hear not the admonition excommunication in case of stubborne persisting in his sinne against the admonition of the church

excommunication exprest by judging
cor
putting away
cor
taking away
cor
purging out
cor
delivering to satan
cor
stating among the heathen
matth


loosing or absolution in the churches forgiving
upon repentance cor
comforting
upon repentance cor
confirming her love
upon repentance cor

this power of discipline is one of the keyes of the kingdome of heaven the key is twofold of doctrine discipline

luk and here the opening and shutting of the key is the same with binding and loosing formerly
matth

with matth


the power of discipline thus briefly declared we now come to confirme the instruction that not to the officers alone but to the church it is committed that is the brotherhood with the officers

it belongs to the church matth

but the church never signifies the officers alone throughout the new testament frequently the officers and brethren together as in the inscriptions of the epistles to the church at corinth sometimes the people distinct from their officers when they were possessed of officers acts
the church there distinct from the officers whether apostles or elders and this church the brethren
so rev
the starres are the ministers and the candlesticks are the churches before they were possessed of officers acts
there is the church as the candlestick before the candle be put into it
if any man shall say that in matth

the church signifies the officers alone in stead of proving he begs the question


the apostle enjoyning the exercise of this power for binding cor
loosing
cor

ascribes it to the brotherhood together with the officers
first for binding cor
he writes to the whole church

to the same here to whom he inscribes the epistle but he inscribes it to all the saints in corinth with all in every place as comprehended in his salutation and concerned in the institutions of this epistle though particularly sent to the church at corinth

the same who were puffed up when they should have mourned
are to be gathered together in the name and with the power of christ pauls spirit joyning with them though he was absent in body to deliver such an one to satan
the same whose glorying is rebuked the whole lump leavened
are to purge out that leaven
whence the apostle digresseth from publick leaven the scandalous sinner to personall leaven malice and wickednesse
the same to whom he gives direction for avoiding familiar society with a scandalous brother interpreting the meaning of a former epistle
they are to judge of those within
and put away from among themselves that wicked person

secondly for loosing cor
the same whom he had formerly made heavy
by rebuking in the former epistle that from their obedience and repentance he might have much joy of them when he should come to them
whom in part he clears
they are the many by whom the incestuous person was rebuked
and they are to forgive and comfort him
the same to whom the apostle wrote to make proof of their obedience
with whom as he formerly joyned in binding so now in loosing they are stil the same whom formerly he had made heavy and in whom now he rejoyced cap

to the end
he that can now cast such a mist as shall darken so faire and cleare a context and make us meet with the officers only in all this missing the people shall allow him this testimony he hath profited very well in the school of darknesse
some footstep of the peoples power here we had in the ruines of discipline by the prelates in that the absolved party was wont to aske the congregation forgivenesse

every brother hath a power and his duty it is to admonish first singly then jointly before a witnesse or two the case so requiring and there is waight in that admonition for gaining a brother mat
how comes it to passe that after the offence is brought to the officers there is no waight in the publick admonition and consequently censure of the whole brotherhood
the end of the censure is to shame and humble the sinner and is there no waight in the solemne judgement of any nor all the brotherhood but only of the officers for this end
if this judgement belong only to the officers then christ hath so instituted this ordinance as many times it cannot obtaine its end without the sin of the church this is cleare thus in case the church or brotherhood apprehend the sentence unrighteous they cannot without sin withdraw from him the party sentenced suppose by officers proceeding as wickedly as sometimes our prelates and their creatures were wont to do passing sentence of excommunication for refusing impious ceremonies or the like if they shal not withdraw the end is not obtained the sentence not obeyed but to say that christ hath so instituted this or any other ordinance is to taxe his wisedome and holinesse
quest
suppose some few apprehend the sentence unrighteous what shall they do answ
modestly declare their dissent and for their parts forbeare to act it

that the church or brotherhood hath some share in the power of the keyes appears by her honourable relation to christ the elders are stewards but the church is his wife
object
that is the universall church
ans
every particular church or company of combined saints hath the whole nature of the universall church and the same relation to christ that all the saints together have cor
object
then women and children should share in the power of the keyes for they are of the church of beleevers
answ
this is a most trifling objection
it is granted by many who make this objection that the brethren have right to chuse their officers who yet deny women and children any share therein
a power may belong to such an order yet not to all in that order the lords supper belongs to the order of beleevers not to officers only the children of beleevers are in beleevers yet the supper belongs not to them
will adde that honour which belongs to such an order reflects upon them in that order who are yet debarred personal application the honour of circumcision sealing up the jews into gods family had reflection upon their women they were of the circumcision in opposition to the gentiles who were the uncircumcision though they could not be circumcised it is a priviledge and honour of our nobility in england that they make one house of parliament and who can deny that the wives and children of nobles are concerned in this honour though it belongs not to them to sit in the house let us now adde the testimonies first of the primitive and then of the reformed churches in some of their choicest divines

for the primitive times cyprian to the presbyters and deacons

as for that which my fellow presbyters donatus and fortunatus novatus and gordius wrote about could write nothing in answer forasmuch as have determined from the beginning of my episcopacy to do nothing of mine owne mind or by

mine own sentence without your counsell and the consent of my people
but when shall come to you he was now in exile by the grace of god we will then deale about those things in common which either are done or are to be done as mutuall honour requires epist

at the end
the like to this in the
epistle about the demand of some of the lapsed that is those who had fallen in time of persecution desiring to be restored having for that end obtained the confessors letters the confessors were such as were imprisoned for the truth
this thing saith he since it belongs to the counsell and sentence of us all would not judge it beforehand neither dare challenge to my selfe alone a common businesse
when some presbyters had received some of the lapsed to the lords supper he tels them they must make account to plead their cause before himselfe the rest of the ministers the confessors and the whole people

we come now to some few testimonies out of some of the choycest divines of the reformed churches
calvin let us observe that this temper is to be held in excommunication that this discipline be exercised by the common councell of the elders and with the consent of the people and this is the remedy whereby tyranny is prevented in cor
that is the warrantable proceeding in excommunication which paul shews if not only the elders do it apart but with the knowledge and approbation of the church viz in that manner that the multitude of the people do not rule the action but observe it as a witnesse and keeper that nothing be done by a few at their pleasure

if the offending brother heare not the second admonition let his stubbornnesse be declared to the church that he may be the third time admonished by the whole congregation of those amongst whom he is or whereof he is a part and if he heare not the church being admonished by her let him be accounted as an heathen and publicane
againe of the power of binding and loosing that is of shutting out or receiving into the church whether at the beginning or after wickednesse committed have spoken before mat
but here it is clearly set forth that this power that is the keyes of the kingdome of heaven is in the hands of all those who meet together in the name of christ that is in faith because theirs is the spirit of the lord and his word for such only meet in the name of christ that is trusting upon christ and grow together many members into one body
then interpreting the
two of you shal agre together to ask any thing he thus speaks of private admonition and absolution in the hands of the brethren the lord speaks here especially of praying for pardon on their behalfe who had offended
hence therefore we may learne the fruit of private admonition and absolution for if two shall agree together to beg the pardon of a sin that sin must be known to them both and acknowledged as a sin here therefore the private admonition or confession of that sin must have had place
now forasmuch as true prayer shuts out doubting of obtaining it must needs be that a brother may confirme a brother that pardon is granted and by applying it to him may render him secure in the lord hence the brethren in private according to christs institution exercise in part the power of the keyes and thence their right of publick exercise of them it being of the same kind wil evidently follow as he there speaks
it is true saith he the lord hath uttered this promise concerning a few that he might teach how he approves and embraceth us agreeing and consenting together in himselfe though we be never so small a number but we shall please him more if many amongst our selves shall agree together in him and we shall be able to doe things innumerable in his name

this chapter shall be taken up with certaine conclusions depending upon the former about discipline

as the prelates stripping both the people and the elders of the power of discipline violate the in two maine degrees we may adde a third in that they take it into their owne hands who have nothing to do with it so they that will have the presbyterian government so exercised as all power shall be confined to the elders excluding the people violate the in one maine degree at the least


forasmuch as the people of the church have a power of for the exercise of discipline both privately and publickly hence we may now clearly see of what necessity it is that the matter of the church be only visible saints according to the doctrine and explication of the matter of the church formerly laid downe
many there are who loosing this peg in the tabernacle of the peoples power for discipline they then loose another concerning their qualification for the due matter of the church and thence a third their right of chusing officers and a fourth the due limits for the sacraments and so the whole frame growes ruinous much admire the wisedome of our king and lawgiver of his church who hath so ordered all

as where his patterne is observed there must be a beautifull temple to instance in this particular because the people have their share in the power of the keyes and the exercise of it therefore they must be a knowing and a holy people without which they have no principles for such duties

had this been observed prelacy had never got footing in the churches

much lesse primacy over all that which the man of sinne claims to his pretended chaire the slacking of this joint made way for the mystery of iniquity in the world and the infirming of it must make for the destruction thereof

in setling a disciplinary congregation there is the substance of a whether in word exprest or not
what is the substance of a the mutuall consent of the faithful for walking together in one congregation according to the rules of the gospel for faith obedience communion in worship and discipline in setling the church in her congregations here is the substance of this these things are visibly done what objection then can there be of weight against the solemne profession of it by word
the scripture seemes to hold it forth as isa
so israel of old was taken into covenant and how often the covenant renewed with them even upon singular reformations

in the primitive times the catechumens when received into church fellowship gave up themselves by solemne profession openly exprest unto the church

when members are admitted in the reformed churches they professe their purpose for religions walking in and for subjection to the discipline

in this as in other cases by open profession and covenanting we lay a stricter tye upon our selves for all duties of

we do more expressely witnesse our high esteeme of gods institution for and priviledges this confederacy according to the order of the gospel seems to give immediate right to the sealing ordinances as visible interest in the covenant of grace gives the first right

it was not interest in the covenant of grace alone that gave immediate right to circumcision and the passeover of old but there must be a profest joyning with the church of the jews in her discipline and policie therefore job for instance was not to be circumcised because not so adjoyn'd


where there is full communion in there must be the exercise of discipline for keeping that communion pure under paine of highest displeasure from the lord cor
throughout but where there is communion in the sealing ordinances there is full communion in church priviledges therefore there must be this reall confederacy for discipline

if the sealing ordinances may at least ordinarily be administred to such as refuse confederacy for discipline then may the ordinance of discipline for ever be refused by the churches but this may not be as hath more largely been proved

to me saith grave and learned bucer the church without the most frequent use of mutual admonition

seems the same with a kingdome that is without judgement without the use of laws and as a city brought indeed under the power of the prince but as yet not so orderd and setled by him as that it should have the forme of a city and of a magistracy being put upon it and laws setled thus he and what authentick right can there be of publick administring the peculiar priviledges of the to the free borne subjects in a city so unsetled so for the church undisciplined

when the time or the place was not for particular churches the first right alone sufficient as before the temple or tabernacle sacrifices not confined to place

conclusion
for setling discipline in this kingdome person unfit for are to be left out
this question whether for the true method of setling of christ the churches aright in this kingdome persons unfit are to be left out or cast out well cleared will make much for true reformation among us
to this we say two things

supposing all such are to be cast out they must first be left out that they may be cast out leaving them out orderly making way for their casting out


that they may be cast out discipline must be setled for

it is by discipline that they must be cast out that discipline may be setled officers must be chosen by the people of the church but persons unfit for
are not the people of the church

they are morally unfit to chuse officers

they are a party engaged as if malefactors should chuse their judge therefore they may not chuse officers

the discipline for casting out is to be exercised as by the officers by an so by the people by a power of order but persons fit to be cast out may not have this power and the exercise of it this would prevent discipline for ever except we shall think that they will cast out themselves

as in a church where discipline is setled such as are formally suspended or to be suspended are left out as to vote or consent before they be cast out so in a church to be setled such as are materially suspended or to be suspended as are all to whom we refuse or should refuse the sacraments are to be left out before they be cast out

if christians in name but scandalous in life have not lost their disciplinary interest till they be cast out then neither have the scandalous ministers lost their ministeriall interest for discipline till they be cast out if so then these ministers with those christians may joyning together set up the prelatical discipline ecclesiastically valid
whether now shall these be withdrawne from or not that the true discipline may be set up if not they will carry the false by number of votes if they may the question is granted there must be leaving out before casting out

they are to be left out not cast out


they onely are to be cast out by discipline in case of scandalous sinning who have beene by voluntary confederacy under it and accepted as fit matter of the church but such were not our scandalous sinners they were never yet under the discipline which we contend for neither can they in true account be owned as fit matter of the church

that only they who are true matter of the church are objects of discipline it is cleare because discipine is for them within not for them without

only them who have by voluntary confederacy come under it

no man or society of men hath over another without his consent first had as the reverend assembly speaks

in answer to the dissenting brethren the mutual assent and agreement of the people among whom and over whom discipline is to be exercised is the next foundation of the exercise thereof

discipline being among the weapons of spirituall warfare and having to do onely with the conscience it hath place only upon those who conscientiously in appearance at least have owned this discipline as an ordinance therupon of free accord voluntarily engaged in it
object
the preaching the word is to deal only with the conscience shall it therefore be preached onely to such as voluntarily submit to hearing ans
the preaching of the word is an ordinance first proving it selfe and then all other ordinances as sacraments censures therefore so far as it hath first convinced others take place
the people of the church are a willing people

the discipline had no place with the catechumens of old notwithstanding their personall profession till upon their voluntary giving up themselves to the church and by the church approved they were received into full church fellowship

the like method is used by the reformed churches none are under discipline who have not first been approved and by voluntary tender of themselves received to the supper

the church is so to be made up of her members in her severall congregations as that the smaller number is ever to be supposed to be cast out of the greater
forasmuch as the people have their vote in casting out
forasmuch as the presence and censure of those who are to cast out make for the humbling and shameing of those who are to be cast out but if all the scandalous are to be cast out it cannot be supposed that they will be the smaller number in severall congregations

casting out supposeth publique but personall admonition if he hear not the church and particularly proofe of the fault for which the sinner is to be cast out but how this is possible in our nation shall only appeal to experience and common sense


if all scandalous sinners amongst us be to be cast out then are they all the scandalous of the church what have to do to judge them that are without but they are not all the scandalous of the church with none of the scandalous of the church must we familiarly keep company and yet may we abide

in the world but of the scandalous in the nation we must upon diverse occasions keep familiar company except we will go out of the world and it is the same case in all nations of the world
cor
with experience
hence the true way of reformation amongst us in this that persons fit matter of the church joyne together in church fellowship chuse officers with cautions formerly said down and so forme congregations into a disciplinary state exercising discipline among themselves leaving out the rest
from congregationall churches thus setled combinations of churches for mutuall help will arise but here is now our scruple about the civill magistrate what warrant christians and ministers have thus to proceed except he by publick authority take order
in answer to this lay down chap
vii
the sifth instruction
there is a formally distinct from the civill
one conclusion will here be of use before we insist upon the proofe of this instruction and it is this the authority and relation of magistracy is one and the same whether the person of the magistrate be christian or not as the authority and relation of a father is one and the same in both cases it belongs to the office of magistracy to preserve authoritatively both tables of the law of god to take order that the subjects may live in godlinesse and honesty though onely the christian magistrate hath principles for exercising this power in a christian way
this premised we come to the proofe


from the ensignes of these powers the sword of the civill the keyes of the ecclesiasticall these as of different

name and nature so they represent that power whereof they are the ensignes different

from the nature of these powers compared
in their object of the one the of the other the church

in their laws of the one such as humane wisedome findes necessary or expedient for the society of mankind of the other only the word of god

their authority of the one imperiall commanding in their own names as lawgivers to the subjects of the other ministerial commanding only in the name of christ the only lawgiver of his church

in their punishments rewards of the one such as concern the outward man as for punishments fines imprisonment banishment death
for rewards revenues honours
of the other such as concerne the inward man binding or loosing the weapons of this warfare are spirituall retaining or remitting sins

from the institution of these powers the institution of magistracy is divine in generall
the powers that be are ordained of god
the constitution in particular is humane in diverse nations diverse in some the governement by the king in others by the state in others by the people be subject to every humane creation pet

the institution of is divine both generally that there be officers in the church and particularly that these be they and no other cor
the civill magistrate is nowhere in the list or roll of

from the conveyance of these powers

the civill magistrate to instance in the supreme person may be by succession must be by election the civill magistrate to instance in the supreme court may be by election of the people of the as such whether duly qualified for or not must be by election of the people of the church as such and they must be qualified according to that they may rightly be chosen

from the exercise of these powers both these powers were exercised in their full height for the first three hundred years after christ when yet neither was any a civill magistrate neither did any civill magistrate pretend to be a


from the dissolution of these powers excommunication dissolves all in the hand of a when rightly administred against him it neither dissolves nor weakens civill power in the hand of the magistrate when rightly administred against him

from the farre distance of these powers a woman may be a civill magistrate as deborah in israel queen elizabeth in england but a woman may not be a a person may by good right be a magistrate yet by no right a much lesse a

adde to these the concurrent judgement of all churches who have ever avouched both in doctrine and practice these powers distinct
hence a consectary
to the church as the church it belongs to exercise all whether the civill magistrate take order for it or not whether he allow it or oppose it
we shall here premise two conclusions to prevent mistake

the civill magistrate is not to allow any exercise of churchpower in his dominions which either is or by him is conceived to be contrary to the rule of scripture and so displeasing to god

in case the church proceed according to and is by the civill magistrate opposed or persecuted she must not defend her selfe by armes but suffer in a way of welldoing
this premised now to the proof of the consectary

the church as the church is entrusted with the power of discipline a great in the exercise whereof consists a great part of the administration of the mediators kingdome as we have seen in the second instruction formerly and this power intrinsecally in her independently upon the civil magistrate therefore it behoves her as she would be found faithfull in that great trust committed to her to exercise it

to the church of beleevers not yet furnishedwith officers

in any congregation it belongs to chuse and settle officers taking in what due help of the neighbour ministers congreg ations may be had
to the church ministeriall in her congregations furnished with officers it belongs to exercise discipline as occasion shall bee
the same right that believers have to joyne together in congregations for duties of solemne worship the same right have they for the duties of discipline the same right that they have to chuse elders for labouring in the word and doctrine the same have they for chusing elders that shall rule them the same commission that enjoynes the pastors and teachers to preach and administer the sacraments enjoynes them likewise to dispense discipline but according to the method of the gospel

the church when in her purest state for the first years durst no more neglect that ordinance of discipline then any other though cruelly persecuted by the civill powers here that conclusion is of use the relation and authority of magistracy is one
if that may be laid aside the sacraments must because partaking in them are acts of highest and the lord allowes not under severe penalty upon the whole congregation the retaining of scandalous sinners in who yet cannot be cast out but by the exercise of discipline

the civill magistrate must not be allowed power to abridge christ of the compleat administration of his visible kingdome but if the church so depend upon him for the exercise of discipline as without his allowance she hath no right thereto then is this power allowed the magistrate

the civill magistrate hath a power cumulative for the churches good therefore he is promised her as a blessing kings shall be thy nursing fathers not privative of her good then should he be no blessing to her but if in his power it be to deprive her of the power of discipline and the exercise of it he hath a power privative of her greatest good her purity that which all the peace she can have by his meanes can never recompence nay this must needs deprive her of her peace too as making way for all wickednesse in a short time to overgrow her and so exposing her to the wrath of god

there is yet another scruple sticks with some and that is episcopacy
they who account that government to be according to scripture know not how to indeavour reformation any other way
to remove this
supposing such an episcopacy as we finde to have had place in the church about two hundred years suppose sooner after christ to be according to scripture

yet the frame of our prelacy made up of civill lawyers and their retinue downwards hath no countenance therefrom but must owne the papacy as the root whence it sprang


their administration was intolerably wicked

highly sacrilegious taking out of the hands both of ministers and christians that power which christ hath given to them and commanded them to use in the exercise of discipline

notoriously prophane besides their whole course abetting prophanenesse and strengthening the hands of the wicked every where a memorable monument hereof we have in the book of liberty of their procuring and enjoyning for the most abominable and ridiculous not without palpable straines of paganisme prophanation of the lords day another the many most scandalous and vile of the sons of men by them ordained ministers and highly preferred

grossely superstitious witnesse the ceremonies new and old so zealously by them contended for as if all religion had been in that

plainly idolatrous memorable here their

egregiously persecuting the voice of bloud speaks here aloud from gaoles from pillories even the bloud of the sincere and godly party generally up and down this kingdome ministers and christians continually under the lash of these taskemasters
memorable here the many precious servants of god now in new england forced by their tyranny into those remote wildernesses

openly rebellious shaking with both hands all true foundations of civill governement under pretence of prerogative lawlesse ones endeavouring the same boundlesse tyranny in the state civill that they themselves exercised in the church
memorable here that proclamation of their procuring and enjoyning so highly abetting and stirring up to rebellion set forth against the scots raised up by the hand of heaven

to stand for the right of civill governement as became true patriots and free subjects

suitable to their frame and administration was their admission so farre from comming in at the true doore by christ appointed for entrance into church office and accordingly by the primitive bishops made use of to wit the peoples election that they scorned to owne this door but other did they not so much come in as break in at stiffely avouching this disorder of theirs
it is the right and duty of the church to separate from sinful as formerly we have seen both from scripture and antiquity how great a necessity was there then of separating from this whole tribe whose foundation frame administration was so apocryphall and supposing then episcopacy distinct from presbytery to be according to rule yet was our prelacy so little of kinred to the ancient episcopacy and so contrary to the rule as either it must not stand or the churches must not stand that we may then come to that we must first leave this
come to it in the true way which is the free choyce of the people and ministers
that this may be done the people fit matter of the church must first be form'd into congregations
as for that which would here further be required upon this supposition imposition of hands by bishops in this case of so great apostacy as hath prevail'd the necessity would sufficiently plead excuse as suppose a people cald out of babylon if imposition of hands by popish bishops might be had for ordaining some among them to be their ministers it were not worth the having but withall it being impossible to be had the call and confirmation of the church is sufficient as beza pleads for the first reformers in acts
but further for clearing this scruple we lay down chap
viii
the sixth instruction
that bishops in office above presbyters are no of divine institution it is pleaded by jerome from scripture and the highest
there is a divine bishop one and the same with a presbyter or a pastor or teacher of a congregation and elder labouring in the word and doctrine there is an humane bishop one that pleads his office to be above the presbyters or pastors office and two things he challengeth above the presbyter

power of ordination

power of jurisdiction
jerome a learned father famous about yeeres after christ in his epistle to evagrius and in his commentary upon the epistle to titus speaks clearly to this question both from scripture and from the first gospel antiquity have therefore thought fit to translate that epistle and thence to observe his arguments from scripture as likewise what he produceth from antiquity that we might at once give double light to this question knowing well that where antiquity is used against the scripture it is nothing worth but whereit stands fair with the scripture it may be a secondary confirmation of the true meaning of scripture to the impartial enquiter after truth and an argument fully in force against the adversary pretending antiquity for his error
this epistle is directed against a certaine person who would have a deacon to be above a presbyter against whom thus jerome

we read in isaiah the fool will speak folly hear of one who hath broken forth into so great folly that he would prefer deacons before presbyters that is before bishops
for when the apostle teacheth clearly that presbyters are the same with bishops who may endure that the servant of tables and widowes should lift up himselfe swollen above them by whose prayers the body and blood of christ is consecrate seekest thou authority heare the testimony paul and timothy

the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons

wilt thou another example in the acts of the apostles thus paul writes to the

ministers sacerdotes of one church take heed to your selves and to the whole flock over which the holy ghost hath made you bishops for it is the same word here that every otherwhere is translated bishops that yee might rule the church of the lord so he reads it which he hath purchased with his owne blood
and that no man may contentiously wrangle that there were many bishops in one church hear yet another testimony by which it is most manifestly proved

that a bishop and presbyter are one and the same
for this end left thee in creet that thou mightest redresse the things that were wanting that thou mighest appoint presbyters in every city as have also commanded thee if any man be without blame the husband of one wife have faithful children

not accused of riot or disobedient for it behooves a bishop to be without blame as the steward of god
and to timothy neglect not the grace which is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of hands of the presbytery
but peter likewise in his first epistle saith the elders or presbyters which are among you intreat who am your and a witnesse of the suffrings of christ and also a partaker of glory to come which is to be revealed that yee rule the flock of christ and oversee it not of necessity but willingly according to god which in the greek is more significantly exprest undefined span alphabet bishoping that is overseeing them from whence the name of bishop is drawne
do the testimonies of these so great men seem small to thee let the sound the son of thunder whom jesus loved so much who drunk the flowing streams of doctrine out of his saviours breast the presbyter to the elect lady and to her children whom love in the truth
and in another epistle the presbyter to the caius whom love in the truth
hitherto ierome

here we have both clearly affirmed and strongly confirmed that a bishop in office above a presbyter is no where to be found in scripture but bishop and presbyter are two names of one and the same office so that whatsoever belongs to any bishop by vertue of his office the same belongs to every presbyter as he is a presbyter
for clearing both his affirmation and confirmation we must observe that in his time the custome of the church had obtained that some were single presbyters others

so presbyters as withall bishops challenging above single presbyters the power of ordination at the least themselves likewise ordained not by single presbyters as they called them but by bishops and it is pleaded by the advocates of episcopacy at this day that the apostles before their death ordained severall bishops in office above presbyters as formerly we laid down over the churches in severall cities and these bishops in continuall succession ordained others neither can a bishop be ordained by presbyters nor a presbyter without a bishop at least ordinarily
against this jerome pleads taxing the great errour of them that would preferre a deacon to a presbyter that it is all one to preferre him to a bishop for according to scripture the one is neither greater nor lesse then the other neither is there any such distinction of single presbyter from the bishop but they are one and the same and this he saith the apostle teacheth clearly and having affirmed this he proves it by many arguments

from the granted operation belonging to the presbyters office as such and therefore to every presbyter which is to consecrate the body and bloud of christ
where is the highest officiall operation there is the highest office but in the hands of every presbyter is the highest officiall operation for we may not thinke that either imposition of hands in ordination or passing sentence in excommunication are acts of higher nature then consecrating the elements in the supper and this belongs to every presbyter by vertue of his office therefore in the hands of every presbyter is the highest office
the like argument we have
tim

those acts which are most worthy of honour are the highest but such is labouring in the word and doctrine belonging to every minister of the word compared with ruling challenged by the bishop

argument from the two first testimonies phil

and acts
of bishops above presbyters there is but one belongs to a city
but here are many to one city to philippi to ephesus and these were one and the same with presbyters
the denyall of the proposition he accounts contentious wrangling whence this discourse proceeds clear


argument from the same testimonies the name of bishop is equally given to all the elders phil

all the ministers saluted by that name for what reason can be imagined supposing bishops

and elders distinct why he should salute only the bishops and deacons and leave out all the other ministers acts
the same who are called elders
are bishops
the same argument tit
with the seventh

argument from the last testimonie where the names are used indifferently one for another and the selfe same qualifications for office subjoyned to each name there the selfe same office is set out under each name
but so it is here
the apostle enjoyning titus to appoint elders any be blamelesse he gives the reason
for a bishop must be blamelesse
if bishop and presbyter be not one and the same the apostle had not reasoned at all might it not be replyed it is true a bishop must be blamelesse but every presbyter is not a bishop here we may take notice of the miserable shifts of the jesuits and with them our prelates
the names say they were then common but the office distinct
answ
because the names were common and that perpetually therefore the father here according to all reason in the world argues the office one and the same

not only the names are common but the qualifications for office are here one and the same under those names
the selfe same office is set forth their glosse here doth yet further betray the nakednes of their evasion
a presbyter say they is comprehened in a bishop for every bishop is a presbyter though withal he bemore as every captaine is a souldier and therefore the names are common
answ
where persons different in peculiar calling or commission do yet agree in one common denomination it cannot be said they are one and the same no man faith though every captaine be a souldier that a captaine and a souldier are one and the same but here jerome expresseth according to the scripture that bishop and presbyter are one and the same

in such a difference of persons the lesse may be affirmed indefinitely or universally of the greater but not the greater of the lesse it is true every captain is a souldier but it is not true that every souldier is a captaine but here the bishop is affirmed of the elder acts
with
and tit
with
their second shift is as miserable for this hold is so weak they are forced to quit it that in the apostles times the office of bishop and presbyter was distinct but both at

one time conferred upon the same persons
answ
this is to be wise above what is written no such thing any where hinted

the highest operations are ascribed to the elders as such to feed to labour in the word and doctrine therefore the bishops office could not be above theirs

how miserably then had jerome argued what folly is this saith he that any man should preferre deacons before presbyters speaking of the presbyters of his time when the custome of the church had obtained that bishops were above presbyters that is before bishops and thence carries on his dispute that according to divine institution there is no difference
now if this jesuitical allegation was true the answer was ready they had in the apostles time the office of presbyter and bishop both though distinct yet in one person as now they are distinct in several persons therefore presbyters now are not by divine institution equall to them the truth is it is one office which was then in one person undivided is now divided and so shared into severall persons

argument
from tim

if that which is challenged peculiarly to bishops belong to the presbyters as such then their office is not distinct but so it is that which is challenged nothing more peculiarly challenged then ordination yet is that here by jerome pleaded for the presbyters in this very question wherin he is pleading the equality of or identity rather of bishops and presbyters
the same we may argue from act


the separating of barnabas and saul to their ministery among the gentiles by imposition of hands cannot well be conceived belonging to any other then to those to whom it belongs to set a part by like imposition of hands the ordinary ministers of the word at least not to any inferiour to those but paul and barnabas were separate to their ministery not by bishops above presbyters but by prophets and teachers who were presbyters
object
the greater cannot be ordained by the lesse paul ordained timothy
answ
this imposition of hands is of like nature with ordination at the least the presbyters concurred with paul


argument from pet

the greek word saith he undefined span alphabet or taking the is more significant whence the name of a bishop is drawn the argument

is thus
whatsoever operations belong to the bishop by his office the same belong to the presbyter by his therefore they are not distinct officers but one and the same
the former part is proved thus all that belongs to the bishops office is comprehended in the word undefined span alphabet which signifies to performe the part of a bishop from whence the very name of bishop is derived but whatsoever is comprehended in the word undefined span alphabet belongs to the presbyters by expresse testimony here they must act the part of bishops which were they not the same with bishops would be to usurpe
therefore if not onely ordination but jurisdiction belongs to bishops the same by as authentique commission belongs to presbyters or pastors and teachers of severall congregations
hence as formerly for ordination so for jurisdiction we may observe that it is to be performed without bishops distinct from and above presbyters cor
per totum there were then no bishops in corinth

the word undefined span alphabet rendred punishment signifies rebuke

the apostles judgement was a judgement of doctrinall determination appointing them what to do in case publike rebuke or admonition should not reclaime him not of juridicall execution
the church was to be gathered in the name and with the power of christ to deliver
had not this church the same power with those churches rev but they were to proceed by the apostles direction blamed that they had suffered such and such as the nicolatians jezabel
the apostle himselfe not formally executing tim

all church rule is distributed among the elders or presbyters therefore to the elders as the elders it belongs and elders and bishops are one and the same
adde here what is observed the word undefined span alphabet or bishop is never mentioned in the new testament as belonging to a perpetuall church officer but the actions therein required belong to any teaching presbyter are not those peculiar actions challenged to the bishops


argument from this last testimony and john

john
there is no perpetual office in the church above that which the apostles hold in common with the perpetual officers labouring in the word and doctrine and according to which they stile themselves but that is the office of presbyters as is cleare in these testimonies
all these arguments we have here in ierome's discourse and thus by him made use of let us adde the
argument
the office of pastor or teacher is an office of the highest denomination after the apostles and evangelists have ceased
ephes


to feed and to teach are higher acts then to rule in way of discipline tim


these are the only ministers of the word given of christ to the church in all ages for perfecting the saints for the work of the ministry for edifying the body of christ verse
but every minister of the word is by his office a pastor or teacher
object
but bishops above presbyters may be pastors above pastors and teachers above teachers
answ
those acts and the power for them whereby they challenge superiority cannot make them above because they are of inferiour nature to the acts of feeding and teaching belonging to every minister of the word

all officers of one denomination whether above them or below them are equall in power and office the apostles and evangelists above them equall among themselves the deacons below them equall among themselves and what hint is there that these middle officers should among themselves be divided into extremes

thus from scripture
jerome now goes on to shew the equality of bishops and presbyters as to their office by divine institution partly by preventing an objection partly by a famous instance in the church of alexandria the objection he prevents in these words but that afterwards one was chosen who should be preferred before the rest it was done for the remedy of schisme least every one drawing the church of christ to himselfe should break it in pieces
the summe is this in the apostles times there was no difference the scripture holds them forth equall this difference was made afterwards occasioned by schisme for the healing whereof the church thought it expedient to take this course but no ground in scripture for this inequality

and this he expresseth yet more clearly in his commentary upon tit
comparing the fifth and seventh together thus he speaks
let us diligently attend the apostles words saying that thou mayest appoint presbyters in every city as had appointed thee who shewing what kind of presbyter ought to be ordained in his following discourse thus he inferrs for it behoves a bishop to be blamelesse as the steward of god a presbyter then is the very same with a bishop saith he and before that by the instinct of the devill divisions were made in religion and they said among the people am of paul am of apollo but am of cephas the churches were governed by the common councell of the presbyters these presbyters not joyned to the bishop as one above them as it is here plaine but all the presbyters equall among themselves joyning in this the father goes on but after that every one thought those whom he baptized his owne not christs it was decreed in the whole world that one chosen from among the presbyters should be set above the rest to whom all the care of the church should belong and the seeds of schisme should be taken away

here we see that this custome came in long after the apostles times generally
object
nay the apostle ordered it thus in his time for it is said here when one said am of paul another am of apollo
then was this course taken but it was in the church of corinth in the apostles time that so they said
answ
that forme of words jerome here useth aptly to expresse the manner of schisme but doth not point at that time as if the apostle had then taken this course as is manifest
when he had proved the equality of bishops and presbyters from epistles written after the epistle to the corinthians he yet saith afterwards this course was taken

he doth not say when the corinthians said thus but when they said thus among the people it was decreed not in corinth but in the whole world

and as it was after the apostles times so that it had no ground in their writings he goes on to shew by some of the same scriptures formerly used in this epistle to evagrius which scriptures he further in this place insists upon
some man may think saith he that this is not the sentence of the scripture

but my owne that a bishop and a presbyter are one and that one is the name of age the other of office or duty let him read the words of the apostle phil

philippi is of macedonia and certainly in one city there could not be many bishops as they are called but because they called the same bishops at that time whom they called also presbyters therefore the apostle spake indifferently of bishops as of presbyters
yet this may seeme doubtfull to some men except it be confirmed by another testimony acts
mark this diligently saith he how he calling the presbyters of one city of ephesus afterwards cals the same bishops
if any man will receive that epistle which is written to the hebrews in pauls name there also the care of the church is equally divided among many forasmuch as he writes to the people
obey them that rule over you heb
and peter who from the firmenesse of his faith received his his epistle speaks saying the elders that are among you who am likewise your fellow elder pe
these things have therefore spoken that we might shew that amongst the ancient bishops and presbyters were the same but by little and little that the miseries of dissention may be plucked up all the care was laid upon one
therefore as the presbyters know that they are by the custome of the church subject to him that is set over them so let the bishops know that they rather by custome then the truth of the lords order are greater then presbyters and that they ought to governe the church in commune imitating moses who when he had it in his power alone to rule the people of israel chose seventy with whom he would judge the people
hitherto jerome upon tit
whose discourse is so plain and cleare that the very reading it over answers all cavils started to obscure his doctrine touching the equality of bishops and presbyters by divine institution and whereas in the close of all he seems to parallel the bishop and his presbyters with moses and his seventy judges that this in parallel is according to the custome of the church not according to scripture rule is evident by the words immediatly foregoing
chap
ix
we returne now to his epistle to evagrius and come to the instance of the church at alexandria further confirming the equality of presbyters and bishops when he had said as formerly we quoted in prevention of an objection but that afterwards one was chosen who should be set before the rest it was done for the remedy of schisme least every one drawing the church of christ to himselfe should break it in pieces he addes for at alexandria also from mark the evangelist untill the time of heraclas and dionysius bishops the presbyters alwayes named one the bishop who was chosen out of themselves and placed in an higher degree as if an army should make a generall or the deacons should from among themselves chuse one whom they knew industrious and call him for what doth a bishop ordination excepted that a presbyter may not do the summe of these words is as at ephesus and philippi in the apostles time the bishops and presbyters were one and the same so after their time till about two hundred and sixty years more or lesse after christ they remained equall in office at alexandria what change soever was made sooner in some other churches occasioned by schismes amongst them only for more orderly proceeding one of the presbyters was chosen by the rest to be in degree above the rest but not in office or distinct power as having no peculiar ordination and this man they called the bishop that this is the true meaning of the words it appears upon distinct consideration of them here we must remember that his prevention of the objection follows immediately his scripture testimonie and the instance of alexandria immediately follows that prevention

the conjunction also or and joyns this example of alexandria to the former of ephesus and philippi for at alexandria also

he makes a difference betwixt heraclas and dionysius bishops and those before them from mark the evangelist whom they called bishops


he shews what the difference was that whereas heraclas and dionysius were by peculiar ordination made bishops as in office and power above presbyters as the like custome had obtained earlier in other churches as appears in cyprians epistles they that were before were only chosen by the presbyters placed in an higher degree and called bishops but had no peculiar ordination and therefore no peculiar office
that they had no peculiar ordination is manifest

by the persons by whom they were set in an higher degree they were only the other presbyters
but
presbyters alone say the advocates of episcopacy may not ordaine a presbyter much lesse a bishop

if they might ordaine a bishop much more might they ordaine a presbyter and then what place for the office of a bishop in the church above the presbyter ordination being one maine peculiar challenged to the bishop
had it then been peculiar ordination that had advanced these above the rest and so invested them with a peculiar office it must have been bishops not presbyters by whose hands they were lifted up

by the explication subjoyned in two comparisons

as if an army should make a generall
here the army chusing the generall answers to the presbyters chusing the bishop so called as jerome speaks he that is generall only upon those termes hath no peculiar commission it belongs to the prince or state to give that neither had he that was bishop any peculiar ordination according to the mind of this comparison which the next comparison holds forth more clearly suppose the deacons should agree among themselves to chuse out one whom they would call here neither is nor could be any peculiar office or ordination conferred upon this
hence jerome concludes having no distinct ordination they had no distinct power or office and that is the true meaning of those words for what doth a bishop ordination excepted that a presbyter may not do this is usually otherwise interpreted
viz that a presbyter may do all that a bishop may do only the act of ordination excepted he may not ordain
and
they that are for the divine right of episcopacy will have the exception to be by divine institution but this is clearely to interpret this clause contrary to ieroms whole discourse both the scope and arguments of it
pleading the equality

of bishops and presbyters or their identity rather instanced in imposition of hands by the presbytery

this interpretation overthrows his discourse in this very instance of the church of alexandria whence it is inferred as we have seen by the naturall explication of this discourse
but
they that are against episcopacy understand ierome to speak of the practice of the church in his time as if he should say there was no difference formerly now there is only this and that not by divine institution but by the custome of the church
a bishop ordains which a presbyter may not do
this interpretation may stand with his former discourse and with the truth and this passing there is nothing for episcopacy by divine right therefore to grant this looseth nothing of the cause in hand but the truly naturall interpretation following upon the former discourse which hath concluded what is here inferred seems to be that formerly given ordinarion excepted signifying without ordination conferred ordination here passively not actively taken
summe up the discourse in this instance of alexandria every distinct church officer hath a distinct ordination but these bishops so called in the church of alexandria till heraclas and dionysius had no distinct ordination from that of presbyters therefore they were no distinct from them
hence we have light discovering the truth against the three pretences from antiquity pleading the divine right of episcopacy

it is alledged that such and such apostles and evangelists were ordained bishops of such and such churches among the rest mark the evangelist bishop of alexandria that they ordained their successors and so episcopacy hath run downe in a constant course from the apostles times
answ
this story overthrows it selfe as is observed by the learned

what place is there for ordaining apostles and evangelists bishops over such and such churches who as apostles and evangelists had already in every church what power soever a bishop can claime in any church to which he is ordained
ordination is from the lesse to the greater if an apostle or evangelist first be afterwards ordained a bishop then is the office of an apostle or evangelist inferiour to that of a bishop
answ
that there was no such succession of bishops ordaining bishops distinct from and above presbyters is manifest in this instance of the church of alexandria where till heraclas and dionysius a bishop was no other but one of the presbyters by the choice and consent of the rest set in an higher degree

another pretence from antiquity is the catalogues of bishops succeeding each other in such and such churches
answ
how doth it appeare that these bishops had peculiar ordination and above presbyters there is as formall a catalogue given in of the bishops of alexandria as of any other church succeeding mark the evangelist in this order
anianus

abilius

cerdo

primus

justus

eumenes

marcus

celadion

agrippas or agrippinus

julianus

demetrius

heraclas

dionysius
whereas yet we have it cleare from ierome that heraclas was the first who had distinct ordination and office above a presbyter

pretence from antiquity such testimonies as are given to the honour and power of bishops by the ancients and here above all ignatius helps at every turne
answ
forasmuch as five of his epistles are granted by diverse advocates of episcopacy to be such as do evidently betray no little forgery who shall assure us that those seven by them avouched in all things genuine are so indeed what more unlikely then that they should escape tampering by the same hands


those seven most stood upon are by very learned men amongst others salmasius judged in the very testimonies very spurious and that not from blasse but upon good grounds

the arrogance of some of them take that for one in his epistle to the trallians what is the bishop but he that is strongly possest of all principality and authority beyond all as much as is possible for men to be possest being made an imitatour according to power of christ who is god
he that can find here an apostolicall spirit breathing surely hath little acquaintance with the apostles writings saith salmasius and indeed how unlike to that of the apostle is it cor
who then is paul and

who is apollo but ministers by whom you beleeved
this was pauls way to take up schisme how contrary to this ignatius here for the prevention of it of the falsenesse of some that in the same epistle reverence the bishop as christ as the blessed apostles commanded you
where is this command that in his epistle to the smyrnians let that be accounted a firme eucharist which is by the bishop administred or by him to whom he shall have committed it it is not lawfull without the bishop either to baptize or to offer hath not the holy ghost committed preaching and baptisme and administration of the supper joyntly to every presbyter this sounds ill in every care except of papist or prelate the church of alexandria had no true baptisme for about two hundred and sixty years if this be true doctrine as for the reformed churches they are in the same case

the idolatrous strayne of some take that in the same epistle in the church is nothing greater then the bishop consecrate to god for the salvation of the whole world

the impertinencie of some take that in his epistle to the philadelphians let the princes obey the emperour the souldiers the princes the deacons the presbyters those the presbyters and the deacons and the rest of the clergy and who are they wonder and what part of the clergy is the deacon with all the people and the souldiers and the princes and the emperour let them obey the bishop
setting aside other flawes what impertinencie is here to enjoyne the princes and the emperour to obey the bishop when there were not at this time nor many years after any emperour or princes christian these are some few gleanings more of the like stamp there to be found that not without reason it is by the learned conjectured that about the beginning or middle of the second century was this forged author surreptitiously brought into the church about which time this kinde of episcopacy soaring above presbytery began


how little our prelates and their party regard his writings only they plead them to serve their own turne is manifest that we hear so little from them of subjection to the presbyters and deacons which ignatius urgeth so much in his epistle to the trallians it is necessary that ye do nothing without the bishop but that ye be in subjection likewise to the

presbytery as to the apostles of jesus christ
and ye ought by all means to please the deacons being of the mysteries of jesus the presbyters are the great councell of god and the chain of the apostles of jesus christ
in his epistle to those in tarsus let the presbyter be subject to the bishop the deacons to the presbyters the people to the presbyters and the deacons they that keep this good order my soul for theirs
much more to the same purpose up and down in him where salmasius conjectures this spurious author was about the midst or towards the beginning of the second century whilst the presbytery yet retaind much of its authority
now what do our prelates and their party here for presbyters they allow them no rule by way of jurisdiction for deacons they have first changed their office and then ordered it so as it is never long standing being only a degree to presbytery
and indeed here this ignatius seemes to ascribe that office and power to deacons which the scripture takes no notice of which hath appointed them to the service of tables not to preach and rule in the church as jerome argues and this furthers discovers that this is no true ignatius

conclude from jerome that before schisme fell out in the churches and that long after the apostles times the church was governed only by presbyters that the bishop above the presbyters was brought into some churches sooner into others later according as schisme gave the occasion that it was about years ere this change was made in the church of alexandria that wheresoever it was made it stands not upon divine authority but upon church custome and this by scripture strongly proved therefore these testimonies of ignatius or whatsoever the like so farre as they plead for episcopacy above presbytery cannot stand either with the truth of the scripture or the practice of the first and purest churches

we returne to jerome his epistle to evagrius that which next follows concernes not the matter in hand but is against the superiority of the bishop of rome and against a perverse custome in rome that a presbyter was ordained upon the testimony of a deacon that which concernes the present

question followes in these words presbyter and bishop one is the name of age the other of dignity whence to titus and timothy the apostle speaks of the ordination of the bishop and deacon concerning the presbyters he is altogether silent because in the bishop the presbyter also is contained he that is ordained from the lesse to the greater he is advanced therefore either let the deacon be ordained from the presbyter that is let him that is first a presbyter be afterwards ordained a deacon that the presbyter may be proved lesse then the deacon into whom he encreaseth from a little one or if the presbyter be ordained from the deacon let him know that he is lesse in gaines greater in ministery
and that we may know that the apostolicall traditions were taken out of the old testament what aaron and his sonnes and the levites were in the temple that let the bishops and presbyters and deacons challenge in the church
here we have two things confirming the equality of bishops and presbyters in the third place an objection is to be answered seeming to favour their inequality
the first thing confirming their equality that presbyter and bishop are different names of one and the same person in one and the same office as having one and the same ordination and where it is said the presbyter is contained in the bishop the meaning is not as the lesse in the greater but as one with him thus he exprest himselfe in the beginning of this epistle this he hath strongly pleaded all the way thus againe in his commentary upon titus as was formerly quoted in these words
some man may think that this is not the sentence of the scripture but mine owne that a bishop and presbyter are one and that one is the name of age the other of office let him read the words of the apostle phil



the second confirmation of their equality that ordination is from the lesse to the greater and therefore if the deacon be greater then the presbyter he must from a presbyter as a little one grow by ordination into a deacon as a great one this rule destroyes the foundation of hierarchy that the apostles were towards the end of their dayes and so the evangelists ordained bishops of certaine cities every one having his proper see then from an apostle or evangelist as the lesse did he by

ordination increase into a bishop as the greater but this is too absurd that a bishop should be greater then an evangelist nay then an apostle
the objection to be removed follows in the last words and that we may know that the apostolicall traditions where he cals the superiority of bishops over presbyters then obtaining in the church an apostolicall tradition
answ
there was great difference betwixt the episcopacy that then was and the prelacy as we have had it as nothing was done without the bishop so nor without the rest of the ministers and people

his scope was to prove and clearly he hath proved that according to the scriptures in the writings of the apostles there is no inequality at all betwixt bishop and presbyter but they are one and the same

the rise of their inequality he makes the custome of the church to the truth of the lords order

therefore that he cals it an apostolicall tradition it can amount only to this that what the church did here when by schismes occasioned thereto he conceives not contrary to apostolicall precept in generall though particularly the equality or identity rather of the bishop and presbyter be abundantly held forth in their writings but rather that the churches practice here fell under some generall rule as let all things be done to edifying or the like
and here was the difference as is observed by the learned betwixt jerome and aerius they both agreed that according to divine institution there was no inequality
aerius would have this inviolably observed in the church
jerome thought the church had liberty to make a difference and that it was a great expedient against schisme
of the same mind with ierome for equality by divine institution it is pleaded by some choicely learned amongst our writers of sacred controversies ames and salmasius confest by a learned authour among the papists medina that ambrose austin sedulius primasius chrysostome theodoret oecumenius and theophylact were

this instruction then stands good bishops in office above presbyters are no of divine institution according

as it is pleaded by jerome
shall conclude this instruction with one question quest
may the church in any case set up as an expedient an office in the church which is not of divine institution
answ
no in no wise
it was appointed that the man of fin should ascend into his chayre thence the church discerned not the iniquity of those beautifull steps by which he was to ascend what the church took for an expedient to prevent schisme proved an expedient to promote tyranny
his time of falling hath been comming on in this last age is more and more hastening hence this truth making not a little for it passeth clear and current in the reformed churches that in the church no is to be owned but what is of divine institution
an argument or two to confirme it

as among jewes no order of priests or levites but what was expressely appointed of god was to be received so in the no other order of ministeries
all by moses there as a faithfull servant all by christ here as a faithfull sonne

christ is the onely of his church the appointing of office is a maine exercise of the power as in the kingdomes of men so in the kingdome of the mediator

all proper and essentiall meanes of worship must be of divine institution

because worship by other meanes is and is hatefull unto god
because it is god alone who can sanctifie and blesse the meanes of worship man can put no instrumentall efficacy unto meanes therefore cannot he ordaine them but office or ministery in the church is a proper and essentiall meanes of worship therefore it must be of no other then divine institution
as for that worne octjection of timothy and titus
answ
they were evangelists who as the apostles are succeeded by pastors and teachers above whom there is no bishop
object
the angel of the church and
of the revelation is the bishop of each church a pastor of peerlesse power in the church
answ
suppose by the angel is meant a singular person and he an eminent pastor how doth it appear that he had distinct power of ordination and jurisdiction above the rest why

might it not be in those churches as in the church of alexandria from mark the evangelist till heraclas and dionysius one in degree and order not in office and distinct power above the rest to whom the epistle is inscribed
angel in the singular number doth not of necessity infer a singular person it is used in scripture collectively diverse times as psal
the angel of the lord pitcheth his tents that is the angels of the lord pitch their tents round about so the revelation frequently the seven angels that sounded the seven trumpets and the seven angels that powred out the seven vials were not seven singular persons but seven companies or sorts of men performing that service

the angel of the churches rev
and
must be taken collectively or the whole company of the ministers of the church as is evident rev
to you in the plurall number undefined span alphabet writing to the angel as distinguished from the rest of the church
having seen the unwarrantablenesse of the diocesan bishop we shall not need to speak of the true officers for rule in the church for pastors and teachers they are doubted by none but the episcopall party for ruling elders to them adjoyned as it hath been the doctrine and practice of the reformed churches generally so of late there are diverse discourses easie to be met with fairly and clearly pleading their divine right among the rest the way of the church of christ in new england the jus divinum the summe of the survey of discipline by master hooker
shall therefore passe to another instruction about particular congregations
chap

the seventh instruction
to a particular congregation of visible saints furnished with officers it belongs to exercise all parts of discipline within it selfe
in it power of all discipline whether all power of discipline or not

the churches instanced in scripture of corinth ephesus thus far they seem to have been each a particular congregation

all the ordinary officers were chosen by the people as officers in command to the flock in common this appears from the doctrine of the peoples choyce formerly of the church of corinth their ministers were chosen undefined span alphabet it seeming good to the whole church in the time of clemens romanus

in the exercise of discipline the people generally concurred with the officers jointly this from the doctrine of discipline formerly those officers formerly by them in common chosen and thus the churches true liberty was preserved
as for that objection the number of christians and officers were so great they could not ordinarily meet in one place for worship the answer is suppose that to be truth yet might the officers interchangeably administer to them as officers in common to the flock in common as wel for all publick administrations of worship as for discipline joyntly
as for the other maine objection variety of languages therefore their congregations must be many and fixt
answ
there were interpreters of languages that those who in the congregation understood not their language spoken in might by interpretation understand it this argues their congregations were not fixt according to the difference of languages


where there are all sorts of power for discipline there is an entire right for the exercise of it for power is for exercise

but in every congregation there are all sorts of power there is power of order and power of office and for there are both sorts of officers elders labouring in the word and doctrine and others for rule with them and in this they of the presbyterian and congregationall way agree

where our saviours rule may be observed matth

there is entire power of discipline but in every congregation so framed that rule may be observed
admonition first single then before a witnesse or two and lastly by the church

where authoritative suspension may be there may be excommunication but in every such congregation authoritative suspension may be this later is granted the former is thus confirmed
where there is power of there is power of excommunication mat
but where there is power of authoritative suspension there is power of

suspension supposeth such admonition

admonition is a lesse act of power and jurisdiction then suspension is

where there is right to entire in the ordinances of publicke worship and private communion there is right for the exercise of discipline this appears thus a scandalous sinner in such a society retained is leaven leavening the whole lump involving the whole society in guilt cor
therefore it is their duty and in their power to cast him out
but in every congregation so framed there is right for entire
this is not questioned
hence to the church of corinth power is ascribed and she blamed for not casting out the incestuous person not because she had thus and thus many officers but because she was a church entirely framed for discipline having in her all kinde of power for that purpose
chap
xi
the eighth instruction
to a congregation of visible saints not yet possest of officers it belongs to possesse themselves of them

here are two things fall into consideration
election
ordination

for election forasmuch as it is the peoples right as such as hath been proved in the third instruction hence it belongs to any number of them joyned together into a congregation by choyce to call officers to themselves

if they have not this right among themselves whence shall it be derived to them
from other churches but how came they by their officers
from a synod but a synod is made up of the delegates of setled congregations therefore congregations must first be setled
there is the same answer for a classis

from the civill magistrate
this hath been prevented in the fifth instruction

from the combination of diverse ministers
be it granted that the people now about to forme into a disciplinary congregation and to chuse their officers ought to consult and follow the just guidance of able and faithfull ministers proceeding aright in directing them yet ought not those ministers to appoint officers over them whom they shall not upon their directions freely consent to preachers to them not pastors and rulers over them may they with the help of civill authority fix among them
in a setled congregation where by death or removall or censure only one officer is wanting the rest of the officers have not power to impose another upon the congregation without her choyce as is cleare by the third instruction formerly shewing the right of the peoples election but those her owne officers have greater authority over her then any combination of ministers not yet disciplinarily setled in severall congregations
much lesse hath any one minister this power


for ordination
not to dispute whether it be the formall

constitution of an officer or the solemne approbation of him by the peoples election formally constitute
according to and thence the practice both of the primitive and reformed churches it ought to succeed the peoples election this is cleare for a pastor or teacher to a church gathered whatsoever may be said for a teacher by office for gathering a church

be it granted that the people having chosen their officers ought to present them having the opportunity to some approved ministers for imposition of hands it must likewise be granted that those ministers without just exception against that people or their choyce ought not to refuse the officer so presented

supposing such ordination cannot be had whether are the people to remaine without the publike ministery and so without the publike ordinances of worship and discipline or doth their election and approbation alone in this exigency invest with let us indeavour to frame a judgement by instance of a case or two

suppose a company of saints cast upon a remote island not neare any churches or ministers and there they are to fixe their habitations may they not having persons among them fitted settle among themselves a publike ministery
suppose a company of people in the midst of the romane territories savingly enlightned with the truth of the gospel
ought they not having fit persons among them to choose out some for the publick ministeries of the church
ought they in case imposition of hands might be so obtained to present them to the romane prelates for it beza saith no
in case that they either ought not or it could not be obtained might they not without it settle their officers among themselves
in case then that a congregation stands convinced of the true bounds of the matter of the visible church and the true confinement of discipline to them within those bounds hath fit persons for the publike ministry among them but can not obtain imposition of hands upon their choyce from ministers sought unto as differing in judgement about the matter and discipline of the church why hath not this congregation the same liberty in this case that the others had in the former object
here they make themselves judges
answ
so in the former instances

what way soever they are in or what governement soever they are under except they see it with their owne eyes to be according to rule it is but blinde walking and blind obedience and therefore unacceptable
quest
in case they go wrong and the ministery with other christians against them be right what is to be done answ
for them they are to obey their own consciences though we cannot say erring persons have a right to obey their owne consciences yet may we say that it is their duty
an erroneous conscience bindes

for the ministry and orthodox christians against them as the church is to proceed against schismaticks so are they against those in case they themselves be in a state of discipline and judge the offence of that moment
quest
suppose they be right and the ministry and christians against them wrong
answ
for the ministery as formerly on the other part here is their duty though not their right to proceed as the church ought to do against schismaticks

for the congregation it is their duty and their right to proceed as in other cases the true church is to hold on her way though persecuted as schismaticall and hereticall
consectary
with more evidence yet a minister consenting with diverse christians nay diverse ministers so consenting may together with those christians joyning with them settle discipline among themselves in this case here is all intrinsecall power for setling discipline

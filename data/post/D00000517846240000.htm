to sir edwin sadler bt
of in hertfordshire

honoured sir

tho some may accuse me of presumption in offering this collection of letters to your patronage without having the honour of your acquaintance yet considering the merits of the noble authors concern'd in it and your own all impartial judges will acquit me and applaud my choice
since not to know the interest you sir have in the republick of letters and what our country has ow'd to the happy counsels of your great

ancestors is to be equally unacquainted with our history and with all those whom you honour with any intimacy
in the first we shall find what a considerable figure sir ralph sadler your noble progenitor once made in the publick affairs of this nation
among the latter we shall meet with no man more celebrated for the politer studies and that true generosity which compose a fine gentleman and in you sir give us an agreeable proof of the present care providence takes of eminent merit

the reputation of the vivacity and wit of my lord rochester is so establish'd that it is not in the power of those illnatur'd criticks describ'd by himself that

are dully vain of being hard to please

to lessen his esteem
the great success of the first volume has made this evident of which this second hope will be a farther proof

the late duke of buckingham mr savile sir george etheridge bring their own credentials and as for the rest that make up this book shall leave them to their own desert being convinc'd that no apology will ever prepossess a reader to the advantage of whatever wants force enough to recommend it self and all that a man can say is taken like court recommendations for words of course tho might here be allow'd to be impartial

where have nothing of my own to bribe my opinion
but sir as offer the diverting part to your pleasure so must that which may prove otherwise to your generous protection with him who begs leave to subscribe my self

sir your most humble and obedient servant charles gildon

the bookseller to the reader

the extraordinary success of the first volume of my lord rochester letters and the great encouragement of several persons of quality who had seen the original papers to go on with the undertaking have engaged me to present you with this second volume in compliance with the frequent importunities of gentlemen for the speedy edition of it before an excellent collection of fifty more of my lord's and a considerable number of the duke of buckingham and sir george

etheridge came to my hands and which are now transcribing for the press being sufficient to make a volume by themselves and therefore shall mingle none with them unless any gentleman or lady who have any of these incomparable authors by them will send em me to gratifie the publick which has with so much pleasure received those already published
this volume design to get ready in trinity term

if any one should doubt the reality and authentickness of these letters in either of these volumes have yet the originals by me and shall willingly shew em to any gentleman or lady that desires it which must convince all that know my lord's hand

there's a letter by mistake put into this volume which was never intended for it tho not discovered till the sheet was wrought off for which desire the reader pardon

to

madam

so much wit and beauty as you have shou'd think of nothing less than doing miracles and there cannot be a greater than to continue to love me affecting every thing is mean as loving pleasure and being fond where

you find merit but to pick out the wildest and most fantastical odd man alive and to place your kindness there is an act so brave and daring as will shew the greatness of your spirit and distinguish you in love as you are in all things else from womankind
whether have made a good argument for my self leave you to judge and beg you to believe me whenever tell you what mrs is since give you so sincere an account of her humblest servant remember the hour of a strict account when both hearts are to be open and we oblig'd to speak freely as you order'd it yesterday for so must ever call the day saw you last since all time between that and the next visit is no part of my life or at least like a long fit of the wherein am dead to all joy and happiness
here's a damn'd impertinent fool bolted in that hinders me from ending my letter the plague him and any man or woman alive that take my thoughts off of you but in the evening will see you and be happy in spite of all the fools in the world

to

madam

if there be yet alive within you the least memory of me which can hope only because of the life that remains with me is the dear remembrance of you and methinks your kindness as the younger shou'd mine give me leave to assure you will meet it very shortly with such a share on my side as will justifie me to you from all ingratitude tho your favours are to me the greatest bliss this world or womankind which think heaven can bestow but the hopes of it if there can be any addition to one of the highest misfortunes my absence from you has found the way to give it me in not affording me the least occasion of doing you any service since left you it seems till am capable of greater merit you resolve to keep me from the vanity of pretending any at all
pray consider when you give another leave to

serve you more than how much injustice you run the hazard of committing when it will not be in your power to reward that man with half so much happiness as you have thrown away upon my worthless self

your restless servant

to

madam

know not well who has the worst on't you who love but a little or who doat to an extravagance sure to be is as bad as to be halfwitted and madness both in love and reason bears a better character than a moderate state of either
would cou'd bring you to my opinion in this point wou'd then confidently pretend you had too just exceptions either against me or my passion the flesh and the devil mean all the fools of my own sex and that fat with the other lean one of yours whose prudent advice is daily concerning you how dangerous it is to be kind to the man upon earth who loves you best
who still perswade my self by all the arguments can bring that am happy find this none of the least that you are too unlike these people every way to agree with them in any particular
this is writ between sleeping and waking and will not answer for its being sence but dreaming you were

at mrs with five or six fools and the lean lady wak'd in one of your horrours and in amaze fright and confusion send this to beg a kind one from you that may remove my fears and make me as happy as am faithful

to

dear madam

you are stark mad and therefore the fitter for me to love and that is the reason think can never leave to be

your humble

to

madam

to convince you how just must ever be to you have sent this on purpose that you may know you are not a moment out of my thoughts and since so much merit as you have and such convincing charms to me at least need not wish a greater advantage over any to forget you is the only reprieve possible for a man so much your creature and servant as am which am so far from wishing that conjure you by all the assurances of kindness you have ever made me proud and happy with that not two days can pass without some letter from you to me you must leave em be sent to me with speed
and till the blest hour wherein shall see you again may happiness of all kinds be as far from me as do both in love and jealousie pray mankind may be from you

to

madam

there is now no minute of my life that does not afford me some new argument how much love you the little joy take in every thing wherein you are not concern'd the pleasing perplexity of endless thought which fall into you are brought to my remembrance and lastly the continual disquiet am in during your absence convince me sufficiently that do you justice in loving you so as woman was never lov'd before

to

madam

your safe delivery has deliver'd me too from fears for your sake which were i'll promise you as burthensom to me as your cou'd be to you
every thing has fallen out to my wish for you are out of danger and the child is of the soft sex love
shortly my hopes are to see you and in a little while after to look on you with all your beauty about you
pray let no body but your self open the box sent you did not know but that in you might have use of those trifles sick and in bed as am cou'd come at no more of em but if you find em or whatever is in my power of use to your service let me know it

to

madam

this is the first service my hand has done me since my being a cripple and wou'd not imploy it in a lie so soon therefore pray believe me sincere when assure you that you are very dear to me and as long as live will be kind to you

postscript starts here
this is all my hand wou'd write but my heart thinks a great deal more

to

madam

nothing can ever be so dear to me as you are and am so convinc'd of this that dare undertake to love you whilst live believe all say for that is the kindest thing imaginable and when you can devise any way that may make me appear so to you instruct me in it for need a better understanding than my own to shew my love without wrong to it

to

madam

now as love you think have reason to be jealous your neighbour came in last night with all the marks and behaviour of a spy every word and look imply'd that she came to solicite your love or constancy may her endeavours prove as vain as wish my fears
may no man share the blessings enjoy without my curses and if they fall on him alone without touching you am happy tho he deserves em not but shou'd you be concern'd they'll all flie back upon my self for he whom you are kind to is so blest he may safely stand the curses of all the world without repining at least if like me he be sensible of nothing but what comes from

to

madam

you are the most afflicting fair creature in the world and however you wou'd perswade me to the contrary cannot but believe the fault you pretend to excuse is the only one cou'd ever be guilty of to you when you think of receiving an answer with common sence in it you must write letters that give less confusion than your last will wait on you and be reveng'd by continuing to love you when you grow weariest of it

to

madam

yesterday it was impossible to answer your letter which hope for that reason you will forgive me tho indeed you have been pleas'd to express your self so extra ordinarily that know not what have to answer to you
give me some reason upon your own account only to be sorry ever had the happiness to know you since find you repent the kindness you shew'd me and undervalue the humble service had for you and that might be no happier in your favours than you could be in my love you have contriv'd it so well to make them equal to my hatred since that cou'd do no more than these pretend to take away the quiet of my life
tell this not to exempt my self from any service can do you for can never forget how very happy have been but to convince you the love that gives you the torment of repentance on your side and me the trouble of perceiving it in the other is equally unjust and cruel to us both and ought therefore to die

to

madam

you shall not fail saturday and for your wretches as you call em tis usually my custom when wrong such as they to make em amends tho your maid has aggravated that matter more to my prejudice than expected from one who belong'd to you and for your own share if thought you a woman of forms you shou'd receive all the reparations imaginable but it is so unquestionable that am thoroughly your humble servant that all the world must know cannot offend you without being sorry for it

to

madam

tho upon the score of love which is immediately my concern find aptness enough to be jealous yet upon that of your safety which is the only thing in the world weighs more with me than my love apprehend much more
know by woful experience what comes of dealing with knaves such am sure you have at this time to do with therefore look well about you and take it for granted that unless you can deceive them they will certainly cozen you
if am not so wise as they and therefore less fit to advise you am at least more concern'd for you and for that reason the likelier to prove honest and the rather to be trusted
whether you will come to the duke to day or at least let me come to you when the play is done leave to your choice let me know if you please by the bearer

to

madam

might be so happy to receive such proofs of your kindness as my self wou'd choose one of the greatest cou'd think of were that all my actions however they appear'd at first might be interpreted as meant for your service since nothing is so agreeable to my nature as seeking my own satisfaction and since you are the best object of that can find in the world how can you entertain a jealousie or fear you have the strongest security our frail and daily changing frame can give that can live to no end so much as that of pleasing and serving you

to

madam

have not sinn'd so much as to deserve to live two whole days without seeing of you
from your justice and therefore will presume you will give me leave to wait on you at night and for your sake use not that power which you find you have absolute over me so unmercifully as you did last time to divert and keep me off from convincing you by all the reasons imaginable how necessary tis to preserve you faultless and make me happy and also that you believe and use me like the most faithful of all your servants

to

madam

dearest of all that ever was dearest to me if love any thing in the world like you or wish it in my power to do it may ever be as unlucky and as hateful as when saw you last
who have no way to express my kindness to you but letters which cannot speak it half whether shall think my self more unfortunate who cannot tell you how much love or you who can never know how well you are belov'd wou'd fain bring it about if it were possible to wait upon you to day for besides that never am without the passionate desire of being with you at this time have something to tell you that is for your service and will not be unpleasant news but am in chains here and must seek out some device to break em for a quarter of an hour

to

madam

it is impossible for me to neglect what love as it wou'd be impertinent to profess love where had none but take the vanity to assure my self you cannot conclude so severely both of my truth and reason as to suspect me for either of those faults
if there has been a misfortune in the miscarriage of my letters beseech you not to add to it by an uncharitable censure but do me the right to believe the last thing possible in the world is the least omission of either kindness or service to you wish the whole world was as intirely yours as am you wou'd then have no reason to complain of any body at least it wou'd be your own fault if they were not what you pleas'd
those wretches you speak of in your letter are so little valuable that you will easily forget their malice and rather look upon the more considerable part of the world who will ever find it their interest and make it their vanity to serve you
and now to

let you know how soon propose to be out of pain two days hence leave this place in order to my journey towards london and may then be but as happy as your kindness can make me shall have but very little room either for envy or ambition

octob

this morning your messenger came

to

madam

found you in a chiding humour to day and so left you to morrow hope for better luck till when neither you nor any you can employ shall know whether am under or above ground therefore lie still and satisfie your self that your are not nor can be half so kind to am



to

madam

my faults are such as among reasonable people will ever find excuse but to you will make none you are so very full of mystery believe you make your court with good success at least wish it and as the kindest thing can say do assure you you shall never be my pattern either in or friendship for will be after my own rate not yours

your humble servant

to

madam

am far from delighting in the grief have given you by taking away the child and you who made it so absolutely necessary for me to do so must take that excuse from me for all the ill nature of it on the other side pray be assur'd love betty so well that you need not apprehend any neglect from those employ and hope very shortly to restore her to you a finer girl than ever
in the mean time you wou'd do well to think of the advice gave you for how little shew soever my prudence makes in my own affairs in yours it will prove very successful if you please to follow it and since discretion is the thing alone you are like to want pray study to get it

to

madam

came to town late last night tho time enough to receive news from the king very surprizing you being chiefly concern'd in't must beg that may speak with you this morning at ten a clock will not fail to be at your door the affair is unhappy and to me on many scores but on none more than that it has disturb'd the heaven of thought was in to think after so long an absence had liv'd to be again blest with seeing my dearest dear

to

madam

am forc'd at last to own that tis very uneasie to me to live so long without hearing a word of you especially when reflect how the world is to pretty women and what occasion you may have for their service
besides am unsatisfied yet why that inconsiderable service you gave me leave to do you and which left positive orders for when came away was left unperform'd and if the omission reflect upon my servant or my self that might punish the one and clear the other
have often wish'd know not why but think for your sake more than my own that forget me quite but find it wou'd trouble me of all things shou'd she think ill of me or remember me to hate me but she wou'd make me happy if she can yet wish me so let her command some real service and my obedience will prove the best reward my hopes can aim at

to

madam

my visit yesterday was intended to tell you had not din'd in company of women which tho for a certain reason cou'd not very well express with words was however sufficiently made appear since you could not be so very illnatur'd to make severe reflections upon me when was gone
were men without frailties how wou'd you bring it about to make em love you so blindly as they do
cannot yet imagine what fault you could find in my certainly twas full of kindness and duty to you and whilest these two points are kept inviolable tis very hard when you take any thing ill
fear staying at home so much gives you the spleen for am loth to believe tis have therefore sent you the two plays that are acted this afternoon if that diversion cou'd put you into so good a humour as to make you able to endure me again shou'd be very much oblig'd to the stage
however if your anger continue shew your self at the play that may look

upon you and go mad
your revenge is in your own eyes and if must suffer wou'd chuse that way

to

madam

tho not for real kindness sake at least to make your own words good which is a point of honour proper for a woman endeavour to give me some undeniable proofs that you love me
if there be any in my power which have yet neither given nor offer'd you must explain your self am perhaps very dull but withal very sincere could wish for your sake and my own that your faillings were such but be they what they will since must love you allow me the liberty of telling you sometimes unmannerly truths when my zeal for your service causes and your own interest requires it these inconveniences you must bear with from those that love you with greater regard to you than themselves such a one pretend to be and hope if you do not yet believe it you will in time find it

you have said something that has made me fancy to morrow will prove a happy day to me however pray let me see you before you speak with any other man there are reasons for it dearest of all my desires
expect your commands

an hour after left you

to

madam

have a very just quarrel to business upon a thousand faults and will now continue it whilst live since it takes from me some hours of your company
till two in the afternoon cannot come to you pity my and send me word where shall then find you

to

madam

was just beginning to write you word that am the most unlucky creature in the world when your letter came in and made me more certain for you tempt me by desiring me to do the thing upon earth have the most fonaness of at this time that is going with you to windsor but the devil has laid a block in my way and must not for my life stir out of town these ten days
you will scarce believe me in this particular as you shou'd do but will convince you of the truth when wait on you in the mean time to shew the reality of my intentions there is a coach ready hired for to morrow which if not true you may disprove me by making use of it

to

madam

believe me dearest of all pleasures that those can receive from any thing but you are so extreamly dull they hardly deserve the name
if you distrust me and all my professions upon the score of truth and honour at least let em have credit on another upon which my greatest enemies will not deny it me and that is its being notorious that mind nothing but my own satisfaction
you may be sure cannot chuse but love you above the world whatever becomes of the king court or mankind and all their impertinent business
will come to you this afternoon

to

madam

that do not see you is not that wou'd not for that the devil take me if would not do every day of my life but for these reasons you shall know hereafter
in the mean time can give you no account of your business as yet but of my own part which am sure will not be agreeable without others who am confident will give full satisfaction in a very short time to all your desires when tis done will tell you something that perhaps may make you think that am

your humble servant

sunday

to

madam

till have mended my manners am asham'd to look you in the face but seeing you is as necessary to my life as breathing so that must see you or be yours no more for that's the image have of dying
the sight of you then being my life cannot but confess with an humble and sincere repentance that have hitherto liv'd very ill receive my confession and let the promise of my future zeal and devotion obtain my pardon for last night's blasphemy against you my heaven so shall hope hereafter to be made partaker of such joys in your arms as meeting tongues but faintly can express
amen

to

madam

assure you am not half so faulty as unfortunate in serving you will not tell you my endeavours nor excuse my breach of promise but leave it to you to find the cause of my doing so ill to one wish so well to but hope to give you a better account shortly
the complaint you spoke to me concerning miss know nothing of for she is as great a stranger to me as she can be to you
so thou pretty creature farewell

your humble

to

madam

your letter so transports me that know not how to answer it the expressions are so soft and seem to be so sincere that were the unreasonablest creature on earth cou'd but seem to distrust my being the happier and the best contrivance can think of for conveying a letter to me is making a porter bring it my am whether at st james whitehall or home
they are at present pulling down some part of my lodging which will not permit me to see you there but will wait on you at any other place what time you please

to

madam

could say a great deal to you but will conceal it till have merit so these shall be only to beg your pardon for desiring your excuse till munday and then you shall find me an honest man and one of my word
so

your

to

dear madam

my omitting to write to you all this while were an unpardonable errour had been guilty of it thro neglect towards you which value you too much ever to be capable of
but have never been two days in a place since away which ought to have given you notice of and have let you known that her crime was making her court stories of you entertaining her continually with the shame she underwent to be seen in company of so horrid a body as your self in order to the obtaining of employment and lastly that ten times prettier than that nasty was so fond of at london which had by you
this was the grateful acknowledgment she made you for all your favours and this recompence for all the little services which upon your account she receiv'd from

your humble servant

to

madam

anger spleen revenge and shame are not yet so powerful with me as to make me disown this great truth that love you above all things in the world but thank god can distinguish can see very woman in you and from your self am convinc'd have never been in the wrong in the opinion of women tis impossible for me to curse you but give me leave to pity my self which is more than ever you will do for me
you have a character and you maintain it but am sorry you make me an example to prove it it seems as you excel in every thing you scorn to grow less in that noble quality of using your servants very hardly you do well not to forget it and rather practice upon me than lose the habit of being very severe for you that chuse rather to be wise than just or may freely dispose of all things in your power without regard

to one or the other
as admire you wou'd be glad cou'd imitate you it were but manners to endeavour it which since am not able to perform confess you are in the right to call that rude which call kind and so keep me in the wrong for ever which you cannot chuse but take great delight in you need but continue to make it fit for me not to love you and you can never want something to upbraid me with

twere very dull and in me to forget the joy and satisfaction receiv'd in your last kindness and seeming to do it were a fault not pardonable therefore madam forgive this impertinence since there is no way that can tell so much the sence of your favours as this and have had a hope that you wou'd be so goodnatur'd as to have seen me but the same which generally pursues me leaves me not in this concern let me know that you are well and twill make some reparation for the pain suffer in not seeing you and if you think deserve your kindness tis a happiness which shall never be forgot by

your most humble servant price

to mrs roberts

madam

have this morning acquainted the party with the honour you did me last night and as you express your self to me only in general terms cou'd do no more to him find him very sensible of his obligation to you and willing to comply in any thing in his own power reasonable for your service it is an easier task for beauty to get twenty new servants than recover one old one and truly conceive him in a desperate condition he was a little surpriz'd to find me your embassadour but believe took it better from my mouth than he would have done from any other

a letter written by the honourable henry savile
to henry killigrew esq

noble henry

sweet namesake of mine happy humour'd killigrew soul of mirth and all delight the very sight of your letter gave me a kind of joy that thought had been at such a distance with me that she and were never more to meet for since have been at st albans heaven and earth were nearer one another than joy and fermyn for here some half a mile out of town absent from all my friends in the fear of being forgot by em pass my wearisom time in a little melancholly wood as fit for a restless mind to complain of his sad condition

as am unfit to relate my sufferances to one so happy as your blessed humour makes you therefore as freely quit you of hearing what cou'd say on this subject likewise allow me the liberty of not answering in your own stile yet dear harry write still the same way once could drink talk strangely and be as mad as the best of you my boys who knows but that may come to it again comfort me tis well can stay thus long upon the matter after the life have led it is more than did believe was possible for me to do therefore do not abandon me yet try two or three letters more there is great hopes of me and if that does not do the business send me to my wood again and allow me not other correspondent but pert and dull mast a punishment great enough for a greater offender for in this my misery he plays the devil with me surpasses himself by much prithee killigrew allay his tongue with two or three such sharp things as you and us'd to say of you know who for lost mine

letters in prose and verse on several occasions by sir george etheridge knight
to his friend in london

dear sir

my letters from england tell me that this summer my lord chamberlain has won the mony at bowls and my lord devonshire at dice hope neither of em have been lucky at your cost
before you receive this reckon you will be in your winter quarters

where you may have leisure to give me a short account of what pass'd at the campaign at tunbridge
cannot but remember mr tho he seems to have quite forgot me he is a very extraordinary person find he had rather lend a friend a hundred pounds than take the pains to write to him
i'm sensible his many employments afford him little leisure and shou'd pity his mistress but that am perswaded his prudence has made him chuse her in the family
the women here are not generally handsom yet there is a file of young ladies in this town whose arms wou'd glitter were they drawn up against the maids of honour but the devil in't marriage is so much their business that they cannot satifie a lover that has desires more fervent than frank villers
tis a fine thing for a man who has been nourish'd so many years with good substantial flesh and blood to be reduc'd to sighs an wishes and all those airy courses which are served up to feast a belle passion but to comfort my self in my misfortune have learn'd to ogle and languish in publick like any walcup and to content my self in private with a piece of housholdbread

as well as some of my friends
however unkind fortune has been to you don't revenge your self on me force the sullenness of your temper and let me hear from you it is not reasonable should lose a friend because you have lost your money

a letter to a lady that design'd to marry a courtier

what irreligious courses have you run that such hard penance must be undergone have you like harlots made your tail your trade and whor'd you into sustenance and bread have you to hospital some lover sent and for that mischief by this worse repent
at rome one penance for their ills they bear but you will all in this united share
none e're this dangerous sea of mischief past who did not suffer or repent at last
the giddy passions of a youthful mind are oft by wishes sway'd or beauty blind
girls chuse their husbands as they do their cloaths where if without no fault they can disclose they easily espouse the pageant show in hopes the colour will the service do so you on marriage look are more intent upon a fine trimm'd coat than settlement

one who tho destitute of wit and sense is stockt with essence powder and pretence what tho without he seem design'd for show the greatest ass is still the greatest beau and asses always are esteem'd by you
don't tell me that his promises are great who e'r forbore em that design'd to cheat lovers and courtiers you must know by course are much as fickle as your self or worse nor that his page that follows at his tail will e're secure him upon change from jail
there's great uncertainty in human life and he must stick to's place as well as wife and that you'll say is a laborious thing all night to serve his wife all day the king
don't tell me of his gardens and retreat fine wives and horses seldom make men great
except we do em as some hackneys take more for our interest than our pleasure's sake both to recreate by turns when first enjoy'd but by possession of them both we're cloy'd
would you procure a husband for your ease who for his folly not his parts might please

then take a statesman when he's gone to court you may contrive how to promote your sport
in every instant deal for fresh delight and fill his wishes and his arms at night
or if his bus'ness ben't a fit disguise to give admittance to a harmless vice yet his great folly will contribute still to help your wishes and promote your will
under the notion of a country friend you many pretty pleasures may intend
but to reserve your virtue for a fool exceeds the limits of prudential rule
for a dull ass whose passion like his brain rather than pleasure will create your pain
and lover's extasies are ne'r so great as when in sympathetick fire they meet for fools in love with soldiers may compare who stunn'd with clamorous noise of guns and war are silently regardless of command and senseless of your pleasure useless stand
thus they when pulse of passion e're beats high seem quite regardless of the profer'd joy

and ignorant of the symptoms of delight smoak out the day and snore away the night
don't tell me you'r excessively in love your wit will soon that vain pretence disprove
blockheads much labour'd under that of old but none dies now but for their darling gold
great is your love and great the risque you run to be unhappy or at least undone
those pleasures young girls fancy are so good are seldom felt but always understood
tis but the magick spell which nature yields to bring such untry'd lovers to its fields a specious bait fit mankind to enslave and to bereave us of the joys we have
wou'd you be vertuous get a man of juice fertile in wit and of his love profuse for only such are fit for womens use where you in mutual bonds of joy may range and in your kisses may your souls exchange
one with such qualities wou'd a nun invite to quit eternal day for earthly night

such would your lavish wishes all engage

and guard your vertue as secure as age
in joys unknown you then might pass the day till night shall take the sun bright beams away and both in clammy joys and slumber quit the fray



to mr congreve

dear sir

the last fortnight which past in town and the first which past in the country had so much sickness and so much spleen that the greatest kindness could do my friends was to let them know nothing of me
and yet unless had been silent so long should hardly know what to write to you
the excuse for having held my tongue affords me matter to talk of
otherwise could find nothing to say to you unless would send you professions of friendship which hope are wholly needless or entertain you with talk of my self
and am yet more unwilling to do the last than the first for have observ'd that for the most part a man who talks much of himself talks of a subject which he does not at all understand
but you are to be excepted from this general rule and you could oblige me with nothing more grateful

than some news of your self
long to know how you proceed in your tragedy and should be glad to be inform'd how many are making a party for it that is how many are writing plays besides
make no doubt but it will appear at the head of a numerous train yet believe you will have reason to be asham'd of some of your equipage
hear of three or four who have a couple of plays which are to go into the house as vermin entred into the ark by pairs where they are both received and preserved with as much care as the most reasonable and the most noble productions
since providence will have it so we ought to conclude that it is fitting it should be so
and indeed why may not their songs and madrigals and absurd and speechless farces help to constitute the beauty and harmony of the intellectual world as well as owls and stotes and polecats do that of material beings
however these fellows productions are fit to discover one truth to us which we should not have imagin'd without them and that is that there are greater sots than themselves for such are all their applauders

but to leave them for better company give my service to all my friends at will's both to those who shew their wit by their writing and to those who by their silence shew their judgments
that would fain know of them nay and of you too so as what a devil have done to you that you cannot let a man alone in his solitude but that you must disturb the tranquility of his mind mean that little have here
for hither come your idea's at five every day precisely and give me furious desires to be at
am forced to make use of a little piece of philosophy for fancy you quibling there and then am as calm as a matron
for am apt to believe that have better diversion here
am lately you must know grown a great angler perhaps the greatest man in the age for gudgeonfishing tho say it who should not say it
that is pastime which probably you may despise
however as take it it is better than lying upon the catch at will's and laying snares for puns as spiders do for flies
but am about to fall into the vice which

design'd to avoid for am about to talk of my self to you which is a subject of which am sure ought to say nothing since it's needless to assure you that am

newport aug

to mr wycherley

dear sir

tho have enough to alledge in the behalf of my silence to excuse it to any man living but you yet have always profess'd that peculiar esteem for you that to make a sufficient apology for my self when appearances are so much against me had need have an equal share of wit with you
but since come infinitely short of that you would oblige me extreamly if you would instruct me by the next post what thoughts and what words should use to make you forgive me
yet to engage you to that know you expect something at least that is like wit from me
but you may every jot as reasonably expect a lusty letter of credit from me
and who the devil at this conjuncture should expect that the post should bring either wit or money with him when the of the nation is lost in relation to both
yet we have reason to believe since you are resolv'd to turn author again that you may retrieve it in regard to one of them
wish you all the success to which your

merit entitles you and that is another reason to make me wish for a peace
for the men who are able to judge have now no leisure to read they who have the greatest share of wit and spirit being engaged in the armies or in affairs
when apollo inspires a poet he did as when he fed admetus his sheep and the god sings now to cattle
wit certainly never was at so low an ebb of which the is a lamentable example as it is a miserable spectacle
when you and one or two more went out of town the great supports of politeness left it and then the enemy broke in upon us and scarce any thing has appear'd ever since in it unless it be that a gamester
we almost regret those moments of abominable memory when puns flew about as thick as squibs upon a
even quibbles and if they could now be found would be as much valued as vermin are in dearths
but what shall we say

periere ruinae
the very ruines of wit have perish'd

so much of the in general

now for one or two of the noble members in particular
and first have wonders to tell you of lucifer

quod optanti divum promittere nemo auderet volvenda dies en attulit ultro

lucifer is grown the most regular fellow in the universe for he rises still exactly after and goes to bed still precisely before and he and his father mean his spiritual father that is his father phoebus live just as he and his natural father did without ever seeing the face of one another
but he has just sent a message to me from the the rose where as the drawer tells me he has the most earnest business in the world with me
the most earnest business in the world to lucifer is the securing a man to sit up till five with him
however will just go and hear what he says and drink mr wycherley health with him

to dorinda

madam

oh how tedious is absence from the persons we adore and with what killing anguish did receive the doleful news of your departure where a mutual inclination has united two tender hearts a separation is more insupportable than death it self yet if my dorinda left the town without a sigh am more miserable still
you could not sure forget so soon at least all those obliging vows you so fervently made vows whose solemnity and frequency were no inconsiderable part of my felicity
alas tis equally impossible for me to express the horrors now feel or the powerful lustre of those victorious eyes that gave birth to my raging passion
since that fatal minute that ravish'd from me all my joys in your leaving london heaven's my witness and every divinity that conspir'd my ruine nay by your own belov'd self

swear the greatest oath my love can invent that my heart has known no other bliss than the endearing thoughts of you
the pleasing idea your irresistable beauties have imprinted on my faithful breast at present constitutes all the easie moments enjoy and how few they must be under the rated circumstance of being depriv'd of your sight none can know but those that love as well
two are now past and not one line from my dorinda oh what can mean this silence do you then joyn with fate to break a heart that would not vouchsafe to live but to be yours an unusual shivering darts through every vein and my drooping spirits presage some other evil which your unhappy strephon must undergo
were it only want of health and not of love that prevented your writing my grief wou'd be less wounding
you may have a feaver but that you shou'd be false will not as yet believe possible
one proof of your infidelity would terminate all my pain for were utterly unworthy of your affection if mine cou'd support so fatal an assurance
but such suspicions are injurious and wou'd

rather question the testimony of my senses than think you were untrue
oh let me hear from you tho but one word the rigors of absence from your arms and eyes will be less intolerable till then my torments are more than arithmetick can number or rhetorick describe
oh dorinda that were at your feet to give you fresh assurances of the inviolableness of my passion whose greatness was once your wonder and delight

letters and speeches on several subjects by the late duke of buckingham

must needs beg your lordship's excuse for not waiting upon you next sunday at dinner for two reasons the first is because mrs to hear me preach which take to be a kind slur upon so learned a divine as am
the other that sir robert to go into the country upon monday and has desir'd me to stay within to

morrow about signing some papers which must be dispatch'd for the clearing so much of my estate as in spite of my own negligence and the extraordinary perquisits have receiv'd from the court is yet left me
i'm sure your lordship is too much my friend not to give me leave to look after my temporal affairs if you do but consider how little i'm like to get by my spirituality except mrs very much in the wrong pray tell her am resolv'd hereafter never to to swear by any other than jo

my lord your lordship's most humble and most faithful servant buckingham

the duke's speech in a conference

gentlemen of the house of commons am commanded by the house of peers to open to you the matter of this conference which is a task could wish their lordships had been pleas'd to lay upon else both for their own sakes and mine having observ'd in that little experience have made in the world there can be nothing of greater difficulty than to unite men in their opinions whose interests seem to disagree
this gentlemen fear is at present our case but yet hope when we have a little better consider'd of it we shall find that a greater interest does oblige us at this time rather to joyn in the preservation of both our priviledges than to differ about the violation of either

we acknowledge it is our interest to defend the right of the commons for should we suffer them to be opprest it

would not be long before it might come to be our own case and humbly conceive it will also appear to be the interest of the commons to uphold the priviledge of the lords that so we may be in a condition to stand by and support them

all that their lordships desire of you on this occasion is that you will proceed with them as usually friends do when they are in dispute one with another that you will not be impatient of hearing arguments urged against your opinions but examine the weight of what is said and then impartially consider which of us two are likeliest to be in the wrong

if we are in the wrong we and our predecessors have been so for these many hundred of years and not only our predecessors but yours too this being the first time that ever an appeal was made in point of judicature from the lords house to the house of commons
nay those very commons which turn'd the lords out of this house tho they took from them many other of their privileges yet left them the constant practice of this till the very last day of their sitting
and

this will be made appear by several precedents these noble lords will lay before you much better than can pretend to do

since this business has been in agitation their lordships have been a little more curious than ordinary to inform themselves of the true nature of these matters now in question before us which shall endeavour to explain to you as far as my small ability and my aversion to hard words will give me leave
for howsoever the law to make it a mystery and a trade may be wrapt up in terms of art yet it is founded in reason and is obvious to common sence
the power of judicature does naturally descend and not ascend that is no inferiour court can have any power which is not deriv'd to it from some power above it

the king is by the laws of this land supreme judge in all causes ecclesiastical and civil
and so there is no court high or low can act but in subordination to him and tho they do not all issue out their writs in the king name

yet they can issue out none but by vertue of some power they have received from him

now every particular court has such particular power as the king has given it and for that reason has it bounds but the highest court in which the king can possible sit that is his supreme court of lords in parliament has in it all judicial power and consequently no bounds mean no bounds of jurisdiction for the highest court is to govern according to the laws as well as the lowest
suppose none will make a question but that every man and every cause is to be tried according to magna charta that is by peers or according to the laws of the land
and he that is tried by the ecclesiastical courts the court of admiralty or the high court of lords in parliament is tried as much by the laws of the land as he that is tried by the or

when these inferior courts happen to wrangle among themselves which they must often do by reason of their being bound up to particular causes and their

having all equally and earnestly a desire to try all causes themselves then the supreme court is forc'd to hear their complaints because there is no other way of deciding them
and this under favour is an original cause of courts tho not of men

now these original causes of courts must also of necessity induce men for saving of charges and dispatch sake to bring their cause originally before the supreme court
but then the court is not obliged to receive them but proceeds by rules of prudence in either retaining or dismissing them as they think fit
this is under favour the sum of all that your precedents can shew us which is nothing but what we practise every day that is that very often because we would not be molested with hearing too many particular cases we refer them back to other courts
and all the argument you can possibly draw from hence will not in any kind lessen our power but only shew an unwillingness we have to trouble our selves often with matters of this nature

nor will this appear strange if you consider the constitution of our house it being made up partly of such whose employments will not give them leisure to attend the hearing of private causes and entirely of those that can receive no profit by it

and the truth is the dispute at present is not between the house of lords and the house of commons but between us and for as we desire to have few or no causes brought before us because we get nothing by em so they desire to have all causes brought before them for a reason a little of the contrary nature

for this very reason it is their business to invent new ways of drawing causes to their courts which ought not to be pleaded there
as for example this very cause of skinner that is now before us and do not speak this by roat for have the opinion of a reverend judge in the case who informed us of it the other day in the house they have no way of bringing this cause into but by this form the reason

and sence of which leave to you to judge of

the form is this that instead of speaking as we ordinary men do that have no art that mr skinner lost a ship in the to bring this into their courts they must say that mr skinner lost a ship in the in the parish of islington in the county of middlesex
now some of us lords that did not understand the refineness of this stile began to examine what the reason of this should be and so we found that since they ought not by right to try such causes they are resolved to make bold not only with our priviledges but the very sence and language of the whole nation

this thought fit to mention only to let you see that this whole cause as well as many others could not be try'd properly in any place but at our bar except mr skinner would have taken a fancy to try the right of jurisdictions between and the court of admiralty instead of seeking relief for the injuries

he had received in the place only where it was to be given him

one thing hear is much insisted upon which is the trial without juries to which could answer that such trials are allow'd of in the chancery and other courts and that when there is occasion for them we make use of juries too both by directing them in the king bench and having them brought up to our bar
but shall only crave leave to put you in mind that if you do not allow us in some cases to try men without juries you will then absolutely take away the use of impeachments which humbly conceive you will not think proper to have done at this time

the duke's speech in the house of lords

my lords

there is a thing call'd property which whatever some men may think is that the people of england are fondest of it is that they will never part with and it is that his majesty in his speech has promis'd us to take a particular care of
this my lords in my opinion can never be done without giving an indulgence to all

it is certainly a very uneasie kind of life to any man that has either christian charity humanity or to see his daily abus'd divested of their liberty and and miserably thrown out of their possessions and freeholds only because they cannot agree with others in some niceties of religion which their consciences will not give them leave to consent to and which even by the confession of

those who would impose it upon them is no way necessary to salvation

but my lords besides this and all that may be said upon it in order to the improvement of our trade and the increase of the wealth strength and greatness of this nation which under favour shall presume to discourse of at some other time there is methinks in this notion of persecution a very gross mistake both as to the point of government and the point of religion
there is so as to the point of government because it makes every man's safety depend on the wrong place not upon the governour or a man's living well towards the civil government established by law but upon his being transported with zeal for every opinion that is held by those that have power in the church then in fashion
and it is conceive a mistake in religion because it is positively against the express doctrine and example of jesus christ

nay my lords as to our protestant religion there is something in it yet

worse for we protestants maintain that none of those opinions which christians differ about are infallible and therefore in us it is somewhat an inexcusable conception that men ought to be deprived of their inheritance and all the certain conveniences and advantages of life because they will not agree with us in our uncertain opinions of religion

my humble motion therefore to your lordships is that you will give me leave to bring in a bill of indulgence to all
know very well that every peer of the realm has a right to bring into parliament any bill which he conceives to be useful to this nation but thought it more respectful to your lordships to ask your leave for it before cannot think the doing of it will be of any prejudice to the bill because am confident the reason the prudence and the charitableness of it will be able to justifie it self to this house and to the whole world

the duke's speech in the house of lords

my lords

have often troubled your lordships with my discourse in this house but confess never did it with more trouble to my self than do at this time for scarce know where should begin or what have to say to your lordships on the one side am afraid of being thought an unquiet and pragmatical man for in this age every man that cannot bear every thing is called unquiet and he that does but ask questions for which he ought to be concerned is looked upon as a pragmatical
on the other side am more afraid of being thought a dishonest man and of all men am most afraid of being thought so by my self for every one is best judge of the integrity of his own intention and tho it does not always follow that he is pragmatical whom others take to be so yet this never fails to be true that he is most certainly a knave who takes himself to be so
no body is answerable for more understanding than

god almighty had given him and therefore tho should be in the wrong if tell your lordships truly and plainly what am really convic'd of shall behave my self like an honest man for tis my duty as long as have the honour to sit in this house to hide nothing from your lordships which think may concern either his majesty service your lordships interest or the good and quiet of the people of england

the question in my opinion which now lies before your lordships is not what we are to do but whether at this time we can do any thing as a parliament it being very clear to me that the parliament is dissolved and if in this opinion have the misfortune to be mistaken have another misfortune joyned in it desire to maintain the argument with all the judges and lawyers in england and leave it afterwards for your lordships to decide whether am in the right or no

this my lords speak not out of arrogance but in my own justification because if were not thoroughly convinced that what have now to urge were grounded upon the fundamental laws

of england and that the not pressing it at this time might prove to be of a most dangerous consequence both to his majesty and the whole nation should have been loth to start a motion which perhaps may not be very agreeable to some people and yet my lords when consider where am whom now speak to and what was spoken in this place about the time of the last prorogation can hardly believe that what have to say will be distasteful to your lordships
remember very well how your lordships were then disposed with the house of commons and remember too as well what reasons they gave to be so it is not so long since but that suppose your lordships may easily call to mind that after several odd passages between us your lordships were so incensed that a motion was made here for an address to his majesty about the dissolution of this parliament and tho it fail'd of being carried in the affirmative by two or three voices yet this in the debate was remarkable the cit prevail'd much with the major part of your lordships that were here present and were only overpower'd by the proxies of those lords

who never heard the argument
what change there hath been since either in their behaving or in the state of our affairs that should make your lordships change your opinions have not heard and therefore if can make it appear as presume shall that by law the parliament is dissolv'd hope your lordships ought not to be offended at me for it

have often wondred how it should come to pass that this house of commons in which there are so many honest and so many worthy gentlemen should be less respectful to your lordships as certainly they have been than any house of commons that ever were chosen in england and yet if the matter be a little enquir'd into the reason of it will plainly appear for my lords the very nature of the house of commons is changed they do not think now they are an assembly that are to return to their houses and become as private
men again as by the laws of the land and the ancient constitution of parliament they ought to do but they look upon themselves as a standing senate and as a company of men pick'd out to be legislators for the rest of their whole lives and if that be the cause my

lords they have reason to believe themselves our equals
but my lords it is a dangerous thing to try new experiments in government
men do not foresee the ill consequences that must happen when they go about to alter those essential parts of it upon which the whole frame of the government depends as now in our fall the customs and constitutions of parliaments for all governments are artificial things and every part of them has a dependance one upon another
as in clocks and watches if you should put great wheels in the room of little ones and little ones in the place of great ones all the fabrick would stand still so you cannot alter any one part of the government without prejudicing the motions of the whole
if this my lords were well considered people would be more cautious how they went out of the old english way and method of proceedings
but it is not my business to find fault and therefore if your lordships will give me leave shall go on to shew you why in my opinion we are at this time no parliament

the ground of this opinion of mine is taken from the ancient and unquestionable

state of this realm and give me leave to tell your lordships by the way that statutes are not like women for they are not one jot the worse for being old

the first statute that shall take notice of is that in the fourth year of edward the third cap

and it is thus set down in the printed book item it is accorded that a parliament shall be holden every year once and more often if need be
now these words be as plain as a pikestaff and that no man living that is not a scholar could possibly mistake the meaning of them
it is the grammarians of those days did make a shift to explain that the words if need be did relate as well to the words every year once as to the words more often
and so by this grammatical whimsey of theirs had made this statute to signifie just nothing at all
for this reason my lords in the year of the same king reign a new act of parliament was made in which those unfortunate words if need be are left out and that act of parliament is printed thus relating to magna charta and other statutes made for the

publick good item for maintainance of these articles and statutes and the redress of divers mischiefs and grievances which daily happen a parliament shall be holden every year as at other time was ordained by another
here now my lords there is not left the least colour or shadow for any further mistake for it is plainly declared that the king of england must call a parliament once within a year and the reasons why they are bound to do so are as plainly set down namely for the maintenance of magna charta and other statutes of the same importance and for the preventing the mischiefs and grievances which daily happen

the question then remains whether these statutes have been since repealed by any other statutes or no the only statutes ever heard mention'd for that are the two triennial bills the one made in the last king the other made in this king reign
the triennial bill in the last king reign was made for the confirmation of the two statutes of edward the third for parliaments having been omitted every year according to these statutes a statute

was made in the last king reign to this purpose that if the king should fail of calling a parliament according to these statutes of edward the third then the third year the people should meet of themselves without any writs at all and choose their of themselves
this being thought disrespectful to the king a statute was made by this last parliament which repealed the triennial bill but after the repealing clause which took notice only of the triennial bill made in the last king reign there was then in this statute a paragraph to this purpose that because the ancient statutes of the realm made in edward the third's reign parliaments were to be holden very often it should be enacted that within three years after the determination of that present parliament parliaments should not be discontinued above three years at most and should be holden oftner if need required
these have been several false kind of arguments drawn out of these triennial bills against the statutes of edward the third which confess could never remember nor indeed those that urged them to me ever durst

own for they always laid their faults upon else like ugly aufish children which because of their deformity and want of wit the parents are ashamed of and so turn them out to the parish
but my lords let the argument be what it will will have this short answer to all that can be wrested out of the triennial bills that the first triennial bill was repeal'd before the matter now disputed of was in question and the last triennial bill will not be of force till the question be decided that is till the parliament be dissolved
the whole matter therefore my lords is reduced to this short dilemma either the kings of england are bound by the acts mentioned of edward the third or else the whole government of england by parliament and by law is absolutely at an end for if the kings of england have power by an order of theirs to invalidate an act made for the maintenance of magna charta they have also a power by an order of theirs to invalidate magna charta it self and if they have power by an order of theirs to invalidate an act made for the maintenance of the statute de talligio non concedendo they have

also a power when they please by an order of theirs to invalidate the statute it self and they may not only without the help of parliament raise what money they please but also take away any man's estate when they please and deprive one of his liberty and life if they please
this my lords is a power think that no judge or lawyer will pretend the kings of england have and yet this power must be allowed them or else we that are met here this day cannot act as a parliament for we are not met by vertue of the last prorogation then prorogation is an order of the king and a contrary to the two acts of edward the third for the acts say that a parliament shall be holden within a year
and the prorogation says that parliaments shall not be held within a year but some months after
this conceive is a plain contradiction and consequently that the prorogation is void

now if we cannot act as a parliament by vertue of the last prorogation beseech your lordships by vertue of what else can we act shall we act by vertue of the king proclamation pray my

lords how so is a proclamation of more force than a prorogation or if any thing that has been ordered a first time be not valued does the ordering it a second time make it good in law have heard indeed that two negatives make an affirmative but never heard before that two nothings ever made
well but how then do we meet is it by our own adjournment hope that has the confidence to say so
which way then is it we do meet here by an accident that think may be granted
but an accidental meeting can no more make a parliament than an accidental clapping of a crown on a man's head can make a king
there is a great deal of ceremony required to give a matter of that moment a legal sanction
the laws have repos'd so great trust and power in the hands of the parliament that every circumstance relating to the manner of their electing meeting and proceeding is lookt after with the most circumspection imaginable
for this reason the king writs about the summons of parliament are to be issued out verbatim according to the form prescribed

by the laws or else the parliament is void and nulled
for the same reason that a parliament is summoned by the king writs does not meet at the very same day it's summoned to meet at that parliament is void and nulled and by the same reason if a parliament be not legally adjourned de die in diem these parliaments must also be void and nulled
but some say there is nothing in the two acts of edward the third to take away the king power in prorogation therefore prorogation is good

my lords under favour it is a very gross mistake for pray examine the words of the acts and the acts say parliaments shall be holden once a year
now to whom can these words be directed but to them that are to call a parliament and who are they but the kings of england it is very true this does not take away the king power of proroguing parliaments but it most certainly limits it to be within a year
well then it is said again if the proroguing be null and void then things are just as they were before and therefore the parliament is still in being

my lords confess there would be some weight in this but for one thing which is that not one word is true for if when the king had prorogued we had taken no notice of his prorogation but had gone on like a parliament and had adjourn'd our selves the die in diem then confess things had been just as they were before but since upon the prorogation we went away and took no care our selves for our meeting again if we cannot meet and act again by virtue of the prorogations here is an impossibility of our meeting and acting any other way and one may as probably say that a man who is killed by assault is still alive because the assault was unlawful

the next arguments that those are reduced to who would maintain to be yet a parliament is that the parliament is prorogued sine die and therefore a king may call them by proclamation

to the first part of the proposition shall not only agree with them but also do them the favour to prove that it is so in the eye of the law which have never heard they have yet done for the statutes say a parliament shall be had once within a year
and that prorogation

having put them off till a day without the year and consequently excepted against by the law that day in the eye of the law is no day at all that is sine die and the prorogation might as well have put them off till so many days after doomsday and then think would have doubted but that had been a very sufficient dissolution
besides my lords shall desire your lordships to take notice that in former time the usual way of dissolving parliament was to dismiss them sine die for the king when he used to dissolve them said no more but desired them to go home till he sent for them again which is a dismission sine die
now if there were forty ways of dissolving parliament if can prove this parliament has been dissolved by any one of them suppose there is no great need of the other thirty nine

another thing which they most insist upon is that they have found a precedent in elizabeth time when the parliament was once prorogued three days beyond a year in which cannot chuse but observe that it is a very great confirmation of the value and esteem all people have had of the forementioned

acts of edward the third since from that time to this there can be but one precedent found for the prorogation of a parliament above a year and that was but three days neither
besides my lords this precedent is of a very odd kind of nature for it was in the time of a very great plague when every one of a sudden was forc'd to run away one from another and so being in hast had not leisure to calculate well the time of the prorogation tho the appointing of it to be within three days after a year is an argument to me that their design was to keep within the bounds of the acts of parliament and if the mistake had been taken notice of in elizabeth time make no question but she would have given a lawful remedy to it

now beseech your lordships what more can be drawn from the producing this precedent but only because once upon a time a thing was done illegally therefore your lordships should do so again now my lords under favour this of ours is a very different case from theirs for as to this precedent the question was never made and all lawyers will tell you that precedent that passes

sub silentio is of no validity at all and will never be admitted in any judicial court where it is pleaded nay judge vaughan saith in his reports that in cases which depend upon fundamental principles from which demonstrations may be drawn millions of precedents are to no purpose
but say they you must think prudentially of the inconvenience that will follow it for if this be allowed all these acts which are made in that session of parliament will be then void whether that be so or no shall not now examine

but this will pretend to say that no man ought to pass for a prudential person who only takes notice of the inconveniences on one side it is the part of a wise man to examine the inconveniences on both to weigh which are the greatest and to be sure to avoid them and my lords to this kind of due examination willingly submit this cause for presume it will be easie to your lordships to judge which of these two will be of most dangerous consequence to the nation either to allow that the statutes made in that particular sessions in queen elizabeth time are void

which may easily be confirm'd at any time by a lawful parliament as to lay down for a maxim that the kings of england by a titular order of theirs have power to break all the laws of england when they please and my lords with all the duty we owe to his majesty it is no disrespect to him to say that his majesty is bound by the laws of england for the great king of heaven and earth god almighty himself is bound by his own decrees and what is an act of parliament but a decree of the king made in the most solemn manner it is possible for him to make it that is with the consent of the lords and commons

it is plain then in my opinion that we are no more a parliament and humbly conceive your lordships ought to give god thanks for it since it has pleased him thus by his providence to take you out of a condition wherein you must have been intirely useless to his majesty to your selves and the whole nation

for beseech your lordships if nothing of this have urged were true what honourable excuse could be found for acting again with this house of commons except we would pretend to such

an exquisite act of forgetfulness as to avoid calling to mind all that passed last sessions and unless we could also have a faculty of teaching the same art to the whole nation what opinion would they have of us if it should happen that the very same men that were so earnest the last sessions for having this house of commons dissolv'd when there was no question of their lawful sitting should now be willing to joyn with them again when without question they are dissolved

nothing can be more dangerous to a king or people than the laws should be made by an assembly of which there can be doubt whether they have a power to make laws or no and it would be in us so much the more inexcusable if we should overlook this danger since there is for it so easie a remedy a remedy which the law requires and which all the nation longs for the calling a new parliament

it is that can only put his majesty into a possibility of receiving supplies that can secure your lordships the honour of sitting in this house of peers and of being serviceable to the king and country and

that can restore to all the people of england their undoubted rights of choosing men frequently to represent their grievances in parliament without this all we can do is in vain the nation might languish a while but must perish at last we should become a burthen to our selves and a prey to our neighbours

my motion to your lordships therefore shall be that we humbly address our selves to his majesty and beg of him for his own sake as well as for all the people's sake to give us speedily a new parliament that so we may unanimously before it is too late use our utmost endeavours for his majesty service and for the safety welfare and glory of the english nation

the emperor of morocco's letter to charles the second

when these our letters shall be so happy as to come to your majesty sight wish the spirit of the righteous god may so direct your mind that you may joyfully embrace the message send
the regal power allotted to us makes us first common servants to our creator then of those people whom we govern so that observing the duties we owe to god we deliver blessings to the world
in providing for the publick good of our estates we magnifie the honour of god like the celestial bodies which tho they have much veneration

yet serve only to the benefit of the world
it is the excellency of our office to be instruments whereby happiness is delivered to nations

pardon me sir this is not to instruct for know speak to one of a more clear and quick sight than my self but speak this because god hath pleased to grant me a happy victory over some part of those rebellious pyrates that so long have molested the peaceable trade of europe and hath presented further occasion to root out the generation of those who have been so pernicious to the good of our nations mean since it hath pleased god to be so auspicious to our beginnings in the conquest of sallee that we might joyn and proceed in hope of like success in the wars of tunis algiers and other places dens and receptacles of the inhumane villanies of those who abhor rule and government
herein whilst we interrupt the corruption of malignant spirits of the world we shall glorifie the great god and perform a duty that will shine as glorious as the sun and moon which all the earth may see and reverence a work that shall

ascend as sweet as the perfume of the most precious odour in the nostrils of the lord a work grateful and happy to men a work whose memory shall be reverenced so long as there shall be any remaining amongst men that love and honour the piety and vertue of noble minds
this action here willingly present to you whose piety and vertues equal the greatness of your power that we who are to the great and mighty god may triumph in the glory which the action presents unto us

now because the islands which you govern have been ever famous for the unconquered strength of their shipping have sent this my trusty servant and ambassadour to know whether in your princely wisdom you shall think fit to assist me with such forces by sea as shall be answerable to those provide by land which if you please to grant doubt not but the lord of hosts will protect and assist those that fight in so glorious a cause
nor ought you to think this strange that who so much reverence the peace and accord of nations

should exhort to a war your great prophet christ jesus was the lion of the tribe of judah as well as the lord and giver of peace which may signifie unto you that he which is a lover and maintainer of peace must always appear with the terror of his sword and wading thro seas of blood must arrive to tranquillity
this made james your of glorious memory so happily renown'd amongst all nations
it was the noble fame of your princely vertues which resounds to the utmost corners of the earth that persuaded me to invite you to partake of that blessing wherein boast my self most happy
wish god may heap the riches of his blessings on you encrease your happiness with your days and hereafter perpetuate the greatness of your name in all ages

to mr bulstrode at

sir

the turks breaking their truce and besieging vienna is very deplorable but might reasonably enough have been foreseen and is therefore the more strange the emperor should be so unprovided
from the princes of the empire surely no great matters are to be expected for they have their various interest and such confederate armies seldom do great things and should they call in the french to their assistance the end of that may easily be discerned for in all kind of probability it must make that king the universal emperor and perhaps they may then bring amongst themselves as dangerous an enemy as him they now fear the old saying is a truth for himself and god for us all and therefore confess think it better for these parts of the world the turks should have that part of germany than the french for that

almighty neighbour should he acquire the empire will be a perpetual plague to the northern countries and in time to the warmer climates too for· he has already made one step into italy by casal and more than two strides into spain by his other conquests tho he had solemnly protested at the holy altar religiously to observe the peace of the pyrenaeans but we see these protestations are no tye upon this most christian king for when ever that he calls the advancement of his own glory comes in competition with his justice to his neighbour the latter is sure to be the sufferer

dear sir politick

to prepare my self for writing to you wish could conjure up the spirit of nick machiavel for how can be able to make good my promise to you who are the great anima mundi politici have naturally a strange unhappy honesty which makes me not the best qualified for politicks
suppose you have heard over and over of the action in hungary where we have been as honourably beaten as a man could well desire
the business of our coin which under the new dispensation has been more then mosaically circumcised begins now to make a very handsome appearance there being great store of new money
to tell you my poor opinion the nation has suffer'd the fate of a man that has got the pox who yet very wisely rejects all the quacks and relies upon the known approv'd method of fluxing she throws off all the unsound part the bad money and in its room gets up a fresh stock of vigour
you very well know how matters

have gone with the bank their abatements are not so great as they have been and it is hoped it will be again in a flourishing condition
you and have private reasons to wish well besides this publick one that the bank is one of the pulses of our government and as it beats high or low a man may make his inferences and thus much for state affairs for really sir have but a mean opinion of that sort of study
politicks in italy may be refin'd understanding in france a genteeler sort of villany in holland interest coarse spun but in england are certainly flatus hypocondriaci
if this be not an effectual plea for my carelesness you ought to consider am out of the road of government and of an age when men generally mind other things people under seven and twenty tho they live about town either are for none or else for a lower species of politicks such as which in the present war of pleasure shall get the better king thomas or the confederacy of players

iesteem tho cou'd not merit your salute and while return you mine in exchange acknowledge you a loser by the friendly venture you have made yet let not one loss deter you from a farther correspondence the amorous or rather wanton widow bears her loss like a christian her grief proceeds more from your absence than his death
have the secret but am not beholding either to him that is dead or her that is living for it
am sorry to hear you made no greater progress in that affair but do not wonder the spirit moves not your fancy so little since you make all your courtship to the ladies those more substantial mistresses the muses are but thin airy phantoms and know you have more of the real than the platonick lover in you
when you come to my years perhaps you'll be more inclin'd to court the latter yet must confess when we come to be fumblers in love we are but bunglers

in poetry the muses as well as the ladies are for the brisk young and gay know not how well the ladies you mention were pleas'd with hearing my plays read if they were delighted i'll assure you twas more with the reader than the writer
children have oft been kiss'd for their handsome nurses sakes twas you they liked and not the plays the pleasure was in your company and not in their wit and merit
you please to say the ladies often wish'd my company that indeed wou'd have given em diversion for then they'd have laugh'd at me too or if they did heartily wish it suppose you did not tell em was an author of fifty which now you may and so preserve all their kind thoughts for your self but had they their wish should ne'er have had mine they wou'd wish me gone from em and shou'd wish to stay with em shou'd admire them and they would admire at the folly of wishing
the sighs the fair one sent in the paper are not come to hand but if know by what messenger you sent the letter wou'd go and enquire what is become of em the fragrancy of their breath is wanting too but that

may be blown away by the wind since the paper pass'd the region of thirty five miles at least for so take it from mayfield to london or at least the wind turning drove back their sighs and breath to you
every thing favours the youthful lover but give my humble service to the fair ladies for as youth is pleas'd with real favours age is not displeas'd with being handsomly flatter'd
as a farther token of your friendship sir pray kiss these ladies hands for me your kisses will be felt tho these send be
have kiss'd it twenty times pray make just payment for think am indebted so many to em at least
sir hope this last commission will make amends for the errors of this epistle

was as apprehensive of the tediousness of my journey as the effects of my arrival for the persecution of my thoughts each step trod seem'd like a journey from the land of the living am certain if had spoke to me they could not look upon me in my wits and perhaps you'll say so too for degenerating into so unmanly a condition
at the same time madam i'll be judg'd by your conscience won't say your self for womens modesty like false glasses discommend em only for flattery whether or no am not a martyr to a true cause or not
may well say i've made a sacrifice of my heart to you for ever since saw you victims on their altars ne'r burnt with greater heat and ardor
i'm as solitary as the place reside in methinks cou'd wish we might converse in thoughts or that our souls might meet sometimes in sighs but

thoughts and sighs are airy substances and barren food for womens souls such fond platonicks as my self may languish under them in a burrough where innocence rusticity and ignorance agree but here waste my time and wishes in vain my writing to you is like my keeping of you company in this that the hearing from you and ceasing to write to you seems equally perplexing and at the same time equally unavoidable for the idea have of you has so transfix'd my mind that even my breath and sighs can scarce forbear to speak the of

my charming tyrant

tho you forbid me to repeat suns rocks mountains which are as essential to a letter of this kind as yet you forgot to except against sighs prayers vows tears and the many other little reliefs the unhappy fly to however i'll now conceal the trouble of my own breast rather than disturb your patience have found by experience that neither despair nor any other perturbation of mind can kill me since have born a fortnight's absence from you and am yet alive tis true life is more supportable this morning than yesterday for if hamlet had not been murther'd at the last night had been worse than dead to day
tell me dear madam how long must live on the plenty of my last

night's feast must quickly again be happy or linger out a tedious life under your displeasure let me know my sentence in one line speak truth and say you hate me because love you
tis a pleasure to be out of pain and when one's going to be executed the greatest cruelty is the greatest mercy
once more let me beg a short letter from you tho it be to chide me for troubling you with so long a one as this swear to hear only you were well i'd give my eyes nor wou'd the loss be considerable because they are of no manner of use to me in your absence unless to read those letters which hope heaven will dispose you to write to

hope is like the heart and as it is the first thing that lives so tis the first thing that dies in us otherwise cou'd despair of seeing you any more but methinks tis impossible for one to have the beauty and brightness of heaven in her eyes without gentle compassion in her heart reflect upon your angel's frame consider madam how that tongue that was fashion'd by nature to pronounce nothing but blessings to your adorers will be when you curse so much as to forbid me seeing you
i'm not so vain as to expect any return to my passion only suffer it and am happy call it by no less familiar name than love
let it be adoration and even that the gods will allow of they refuse not our sacrifices nor are they angry at our anthems and if they their blessings they plead predestination for their excuse

never cou'd the author of don quixot more handsomly ridicule the mad and airy gallantries of romantick heroes than you did in your last your most unfortunate humble servant
your letter has had so good effect upon me that have not executed my resolution tho this scribble will seem to signifie that the lead has entred my skull already truly madam have so much occasion for brains especially when write to a lady of your apprehension that can as little part with any as a member do with his priviledges but it is possible madam that a pistol can do more to your admirer than the conclusion of your letter
you tell me there must not hope to see you more you may from thence imagine that no other attempt can be equally fatal to a man of errantry
have only the satisfaction left to know that cannot be more miserable for he that's

drown'd needs no more fear rain than the withered flowers does the hot sunshine
now madam to free you from the pain of reading any more which suppose you'll take care to do your self by not calling for them i'll only ask leave to tell you that cruelty becomes the nymphs as little as an effeminacy does the swains nor can study any revenge half so terrible to you as your acting against your self which is in designing to marry
hope before you leap down the precipice you'll once more take leave of

better late than never is an old proverb madam and hope a true one at least rely so much upon it that venture to write to you after six months neglect
not that think you care much for my letters neither don't mistake
but perhaps you may be apt to say people need not be so sparing of em unless they were of greater value and perhaps you'd say right but that does not hinder people from being as lazy as ever nor from continuing to be so impudent to expect pardon without being able to urge one tolerable excuse for what's bred in the bone you know will never out at the flesh
so there's another proverb for you half a dozen more would stand me in great stead to make out my letter for know my you an account of all material things intrigues and new petticoats
as for politicks you'd clap them under and well if they far'd no worse
in short know nothing but religion you care a

farthing for and that the town's so bare of at present cou'd as soon send you money
prays but the court and perhaps they had as good let it alone at least sees by the effects what they pray for tis thought a general excise
but heaven who knows our wants better seems to be of opinion a general peace will do as well
they say the bully of france is leaving all in the lurch for which he has both the blessings and curses of many a poor dog about this town
for as to matters of wealth and plenty you must know the impartiality of our men of business has been such they have brought williamite and jacobite to much about the same pitch
but now we are all going to flourish again so hope we shall see your ladiship in town against the peace is proclaim'd that upon the your billet may burn too

can tell you one thing you ought to appear in your own defence for the first time shew'd my self since came to town upon that theatre of truth and good nature the was immediately regal'd with the old story tho from another hand that

now you were gone for certain
but that worthy mr that mirrour of chivalry for all wrong'd ladies drew his tongue in your defence and madam had the honour to be his sancho pancho in your justification
but how long we shall be able to stand our ground can't tell unless you'll come and lug out too and then don't doubt but we shall make our party good
now you must know madam one good turn deserves another there's a proverb again stand as much in need of your weapon as you can do of mine
here's a scoundrel play come out lately by which the author has been pleas'd to bring all the reverend ladies of the town upon his back with my the head of em for saying an old bawd was good for nothing
but that is not all his misfortune there's a younger knot who having grimac'd themselves into the faction of piety say tis a wicked play and a blasphemous play and a beastly filthy bawdy play and so never go to it but in a mask
dear mrs come to town again quickly and don't put your upon us any longer for here's a world of mischief in your absence the is

now things mend my lord and an italian abbot makes a good pimp his only fault is he's damn'd hard of hearing a shout in another man's ear is but a whisper in his a vile quality for a bawd
however he's a person of business and one of his belles dames is a better sophister than you are for you pretend but to argue fornication no sin whilst she proves it a vertue and all the sake of religion
her case is this she's a sister of the string tickles a guitar to a miracle and that she gets her living by her beauty her modesty her wit and her youth would help her to a better livelihood if her conscience would give her leave to lay about her like the rest of her sex but her inclinations being upwards and having a sower contempt of this vile earth she desires to give her

self to her good god and saunter out her days in a nunnery but she wants five hundred pistoles to introduce her and that she's willing
she computes about a run may satisfie any reasonable gentleman and that he'll then give her leave to quit that same filthy business for a swing of spiritual

so if your lordship knows ever a whose purse is as lavish as will the relief of distressed vertue pray tell him this pitiful story which is a truth by

the french say you'll be altogether by the ears about six weeks hence and that they are to go over and take possession of some houses and parks that belong to des bougres d'anglois qui vont a leur ordinaire se soulever contre leur prince naturel
god send this invasion say twill at least have one good effect twill legitimate adultery here which have been seeking arguments for in vain for if they enter our houses lex talionis we whip into their wives

rapes will be lawful too by the same morality
so pray my lord come over for here's like to be work for a mine

my lord got a nauseous mistress here a beauty a slatternly sow founder'd of both her feet in short hate her and so do everybodies but my own and her like so well believe shall have my bones broke about her before have done there being some impertinent people akin to her who won't let quiet
my lord the soup's upon the table you'll excuse me for there are four tall germans about it who will swallow it down scalding hot in less time than an man can say grace
may heaven preserve you still fifty years more and kill your father betwixt this and christmas

harry

i'm afraid thou'rt turn'd a meer adamite that is hast forfeited thy health and happiness to purchase more knowledge or else thou art plaguily bely'd
oh that pleasure harry is a hellish pleasure
how sweet in the enjoyment and how sower in the event well suppose thou'rt throughly convinc'd there's no such thing as heaven upon earth as a great many vain fellows imagine since our pleasures are not only bounded in one particular thing but the greatest variety of enjoyments finish in the uneasie desire of their continuance or the more torturing experience of its impossibility or at least their punishment by a prodigious fluxing
the most permanent of all our habits is that part of em which are vicious or that which we are taught to believe so
a good thought is as easily spoil'd in devotion as tis in study
the obscenest

in one moment will ruine the strongest efforts of a pious preparation
oh this nature of ours tho it be the most prevailing rhetorick is yet a compound of extreams the minute that gives birth to the most endear'd of our entertainments gives such an assurance of their conclusion that palls them in the possession our entertainment is very often uneafie to us from the care we take to be regular and we are seldom guilty of so great solecism as when we endeavour to avoid all for silence which is a peculiar remedy against em is at the same time the greatest solecism in conversation
why this moment was thinking to treat you as one of my familiars and in my very design of being so my deficiency has carried me to a quite opposite matter and am unawares an unskilful moralist or an unbiting satyr
hope you will pardon my impertinence and accept this small epistle from him who is your affectionate

humble servant

to

madam

cou'd no more hope to see you considering the time of your letter's coming to my hands than could have any peace without it
not all the objects in the world could divert my melancholy but your letter which had done it effectually but that it gave me the sensible mortification of despairing to find you
lord madam how insensible of passion are you to see and reject such evidence of my love am sorry you give me so great a shew of your levity and so much apprehension of my ill fortune
if my condition be not answerable to your beauty this can tell my passion is the most exalted in nature
wish nature would afford me some signal method to convince you of it that might at least hope a reciprocal one from you
in my own brain feel both all the pain and love which poets feign romantick heroes to have done

and am scarce less mad to let you know how much wou'd be thought to be your humble servant

damon

to sir john in imitation of a letter in the histoires facetieuses

dear knight

this comes to inform you that am in the land of the living and that's all
but as for the pleasures of this transitory world which the hypocrites that use them and the rakehells that are past them call vanities am no more the better for them than a laplander is for the sun of italy or to come nearer home than is for the wealth of the bank at amsterdam
a curse on that unlucky night when you and got so drunk at the together for do but observe what were the effects on't
drunkenness sir john drew fornication after it and these two sins in wicked conjunction begot a most undutiful child the lord knows between em who before he was a fortnight old depos'd both his father and

mother
thus being disabled from whoring and out of respect to my own carcass not daring to drink am grown as grave and as contemplative and as virtuous a person as you cou'd desire to stick your knife in
like the rest of the world too when they turn saints find the devil and all of ill nature has come upon me with my virtue
am as splenatick and peevish as a poor dog of an author that has been bilked in a dedication
neither man woman nor child can escape my censures
roar against sin louder than a fellow that is paid to do it in publick tho at the same time wishes it no mischief in his heart
rail at whether know them or no and in some of my moody fits don't care a farthing if half the men in the kingdom were hang'd and all the women sent to old clovenfoot

once more a curse on that unlucky night when this disaster befel me
dear sir john for heavens sake help me to pelt it with some vigorous some emphatical some gigantick curses may it hereafter know no mirth nor pleasure

not even that of signs and rubbing out of no balls nor serenades no jollity of drunkards nor enjoyment of lovers
may it hear of nothing but execrations of losing gamesters fires burglaries and slaughtered watchmen
magistrates of the night surrendring up their pious souls in kennels and the withered bullies that did it dying and blaspheming by their side
murders hideous enough to fright an italian and unnatural rapes that would make even a pamper'd cardinal tremble
but a pox on't don't curse worth a straw
one scotch pedlar heartily warm'd wou'd half a dozen such puny fellows as am
therefore dear sir john come to my assistance and help me out at a pinch
curse that unlucky night or curse the wine or curse the master tis all one in the original hebrew so you do but curse
but especially pour a double vial of your wrathful spirit upon the discourteous damosel that brought me to this
may providence everlastingly toss her from the chirurgeon hands to the bayliff's and so back again in soecula soeculorum or may her ill fate force her in her old

age to scotland where may the kirk condemn her to be roasted alive for a sorceress and may she be as long a burning as the universe will be at the conflagration

to

dear madam

never any mortal laboured under such a perplexity of fortune or variety of confusions should certainly put a period to this being of mine but that am still willing to submit to you the triumph as you have had it so indisputably over my heart even so take it over my life since it offends you and affords me no comfort
how can you imagine that one bereft of his soul can survive its absence no more can you the possibility of mine and at the same time be convinc'd of the reality of my passion
these twelve months at least have been endeavouring to cast off my chains and to quit a cause which cou'd no more hope to triumph in than had to be happy without it but find as impossible as to abandon my breath and retain my vital motion
conjure you madam by all the ties of nature pity me and the mischievous circumstances of my ill fortune that has plac'd me in a

sphere which can no more entitle me to your esteem than encourage my presumption
but pardon me madam if wish fortune had been less benevolent to you that might have given you a more ample evidence of my passion and my self a greater prospect of success and believe assuredly twou'd be the greatest inhumanity in the world in ceasing to kill or ceasing to make me the happiest of your humble servants

adieu

to a gentleman in cambridge

honest sam

since you are so stout i'll be so too and pick your pocket of two pence a thing hope excusable in a friend
but perhaps you'll say some people have a plaguy deal of impudence to call themselves so since you give em no encouragement by your letters but at the same time that does not suppress this impudence for what's bred in the bone will never out of the flesh and so there's a proverb for you
why i'll promise thee sam wish thoud'st pick my pocket after such a friendly manner
but see absent acquaintance are as little thought of as past iniquities and the devil of forgetfulness reigns as much in cambridgeshire as that of poverty does in london
however heartily wish thee void of both for these devils are bloody things to be dispossess'd when they have once got a footing as an instance of which there's a good honest fellow has sent his wife to the other world under

the same predicament
your brother and are consulting now to make you penniless for we're plaguily afraid that you eat so much of the divine banquet that you can afford none of your absent friends so much as a refreshment and so honest sam good night to thee

tis strange that what e're noddle akes some friend or other still partakes whoever wrote have always sought some one for gossip to their thought
after hunting long in vain to vent th incumbrance of my brain like spurious
race of humble whore resolve to lay it at your dore
and just as other writers use shall plead prescription for excuse for custom that does still dispense with universal influence and makes things right or wrong appear just as they do her liv'ry wear can justifie impertinence and stamp it into sterling sence
therefore care not what write for tho scribble you endite treat you at your own expence and furnish words but you the sence

and therefore fear not to miscarry

since am but your secretary for as our eyes but passive are as learned philosophers aver and only convey to the mind idea's which first there we find yet are themselves but helps to see as other be so in these lines what ever's meant only am your instrument and nothing have at my command but the meer motion of my hand for all the sence you must expect springs from your proper intellect
the learned st book that e're was wrot to him that understands it not no other prospect e're affords then a meer anarchy of words for books like all things else are good or bad but as they're understood and when men quote em they mistake they did not find it so but make so whatsoe're from them we smatter is but the sense of commentator for words indeed altho sown thick like cyphers in arithmetick when all cast up to nothing come the figure only make the sum

so readers must to books supply

what feeble characters deny
and hence it is that all things sound just as their fancies do expound and if they take em in a wrong sence all authors have been serv'd so long since
did they not make old homer prate of boots and shooes and god knows what made him on philosophy and vertues of sage tea and coffee and jests too up and down to scatter where he thought nothing of the matter made they not virgil strange things write and prophesie by the means of our salvation and all this by their inspiration make they not him mens fortunes tell of which he ne're thought syllable pronounce the fate of men in battle and of invaders of strange cattle detect by in his verse thieves and conjurers and surer tell who drives that game on than or mean time perhaps there's but one leaf betwixt the justice and the thief his worship wou'd a little later have found it quite another matter

and had been to his sole jeopardy

suspended for meer being tardy or acted at the rump of cart with spartan patience his part
make they not horace a stark ass reduc'd to ballad class strip him of all that's gay and witty to fit him up to doleful ditty tagg'd forth with miserable rhimes from bulks and in the streets he chimes
with rosamond now lydia vies and fills the maudlin eyes while hopkins is forgot and sternhold so often chanted forth in barn old
was not sage terence at adventure by oily shadwell turn'd to banter and taught for duller sence of's own the brisk gay nonsense of the town and his insipid tale improv'd by what the town and lov'd whose whole stock is a bully a wench a usurer a cully
from whence with little pains straightway or wit he oft does launch a play as cits with blue secure from staining a heroe fit on days of training

more modern methods of gallanting and sempstress the most recent arts of captivating stragling hearts and exercise the wit of youth on snails and truth
nor him that late in sparkish prose appear'd to edifie the beaus who with soft lines and softer looks expertly baits his amorous hooks and brings with elegant epistle each melting damsel to his whistle and makes her stoop to him as sure as hungry hawk does to his lure who lately drew in vindication of all the beauties in the nation and boldly tilted with his pen gainst all that durst oppose him then which some apology some satyr both equidistant from the matter for surely no design was in't but barely to appear in print
which he as kindly since has done gallants for your instruction where the grand secrets he imparts for battering obdurate hearts how you to or coach may make a regular approach

he shews you how you shall prevail

with lines as fenceless as a flail for letters missive weapons are which lovers combat with from far shews how to take em by surprize or use the artillery of eyes but if necessity oblige to methods of a closer siege he shews such means as might improve the greatest engineer in love to bribe the sentinel her maid or storm her with a serenade and if by these she be not won bombard with sonnet or lampoon if these attempts she still defies to blow her up with mines of sighs for sighs indeed altho no lowder are the discharge of love's and therefore tis they seldom fail to blow up petticoats full well but if so fortify'd she prove to baffle all the assaults of love and on strict scrutiny you are oblig'd in honour to despair he's deepest read in all those laws that relate nearest to your cause can tell you whether soon as known twere properer to hang or drown

instruct you too what streams or boughs

it were convenient you shou'd chuse what art is requisite what care to plunge or swing with moving air what rules are order'd by romance and which are a la mode de france for these things must be nicely done or else the glory of em's gone by one mistake more honour's lost than being beaten from your post
pass by for doggrel celebrated names with authors of substantial prose that dress like wits and write like beaux
but to return to application that is to from citing of great name that oft fill every mouth of fame render'd by her so necessary to grocer cook apothecary in doing which my sole intent was meerly to shew precedent and prove that fine things may be writ with very little or no wit for wit some authors do maintain is but a fungus of the brain the of superfluous thought by too luxuriant fancy wrought

a hasty and abortive birth

like that of earth which doth to thousand figures vary and therefore not held salutary and tho for wanton palates drest counted uneasie to digest and then too must be taken young before its venom grow too strong so wit anomalous and rude of ill digestion and crude till after needful preparation with wholesom picle of discretion and where it is of constant use does surfeits in the mind produce breeds strange diseases in the purse and is its own admirer's curse they therefore pardon surely merit who in their writings do forbear it and rather chuse to feed in quiet on homelier but more whole some diet from whence if peccant vapours breed or turgid flatulence proceed the only symptoms they produce and danger's but a crepitus which as we do in authors read springs from the bowels not the head and tho receiv'd with publick scorn expires as soon as it is born

so writings which no sence affords

are but a crepitus of words and tho with windy lines they swell ye rise from a vacuum in the belly in which no meaning's to be found or any scope beside the sound
but sir have almost forgot what intended to have wrote and my first subject worse neglect than modern pulpiteer his text who take the freedom to digress and vary subjects as they please while with rhetorical harangue and voice tun'd to religious twang he treats all those that come to hear it with choicest gifts of purest spirit where pious folks convene drawn thither by th help of stiff erected leather with dresses faces mien and air screw'd up to piety and pray'r where holy man in all he saith lays salt of grace on tails of faith where saints are sous'd in by moderns styl'd a conventicle

letters of love and gallantry
to eugenia

madam

tho it be not a full week since received the honour of my dear eugenia letter yet it has been long enough for me to wish a thousand times were since by an unlucky sprain in my i've been forced to omit the duty these three posts
my building is near finish'd and when it is so hope my dear eugenia will be so kind to her constant slave to furnish my new house with an engaging new mistress if not for my sake at least for her own since vow shall

come a most fierce design on love and matrimony and love you know is a spirit that when once a woman has conjur'd up she must find it some employment or else twill tear the charming sorceress her self to pieces
therefore fair widow beware

if my hand were not still in great pain i'd give you a thousand thanks for your dear letter and perhaps pick as many quarrels with you about it but heaven forgive you your want of charity when you think could write the same things to my do to eugenia when my conscience can't reproach me with thinking the youngest of your sex charming enough to extort one of this kind from me excepting your self
nor is it madam the easiest thing in the world to feign a passion say things of that force and tenderness or act an absent lover for so many years together as have been eugenia votary
i'm sure the whole legend of love can't furnish you with one example of so constant an hypocrite as have been if must needs be so
therefore

if can't convince you of my sincerity and by that plead a merit to your love yet let the novelty of the thing at least move your pity when you think what pains i've taken since all that comes not naturally is so to say so many kind tender and passionate things of one have no concern for
think whether it be not almost equally difficult to write passionately to one am not really in love with and to paint a sound
who can act hunger without an appetite or long scene of fury and anger without being pefectly heated

but if you are so severe to think that my first pretences were all fiction yet madam pray consider that liars often tell stories of their own invention so long till at last they themselves believe em true and as the roman in martial counterfeited the gout till he had it in earnest so supposing my vows at first but feign'd they must by this time be ripen'd into truth by your influence like the dew drops of heaven into precious stones by the heat of the eastern sun and so become sacred as all things addressed to you must be madam

but if lov'd not eugenia with the greatest and most sincere passion that ever man lov'd a woman know not what reason what interest or what design cou'd have to pretend it since i'm not so vain to expect any other benefit of it than her laughter and in that my trouble
however madam have this satisfaction in my own mind that love the best and finest of her sex tho a mother who like a taper has not suffer'd the least diminution of her own lustre by the lighting others into the world but still preserves her original light so firmly as to enslave all that behold her as well as madam

your eternal slave lysander

by the same

madam

no desperate wretch guilty of the most execrable murders had ever that trouble that agony of mind that have endur'd since the receipt of your last in which you discovered so severe and cruel a resentment of a crime was not guilty of
if have ever offended you ask your ladiship ten thousand thousand pardons
ah madam if my love were not as lasting as my life and so were as inseparable as soul and body nay were there any prospect any possibility of my ever loving you less shou'd not need to be thus troublesom to your ladiship to beg you not to use the extent of your power over me to punish me for a crime was never guilty of yet whether i'm guilty or not so much so extravagantly love you that if you yet convict me shall stand condemned even in my own opinion
nay if you madam will positively accuse me of all the the ills in the world i'll own em for it

shall never be said that for the sake of my own happiness interest or honour ever contradicted the assertion of her profess'd the greatest and most generous passion for that ever unhappy man experienc'd
but madam had been guilty of any little error consider it as coming from a man almost distracted madam for the love of you for i'm sure appear so to all that visit me yet tho most guess the cause the person is only known to the wounded heart of

madam your constant slave lysander
postscript starts here ah madam don't use a passion so tender as mine with so much tyranny since the power you have is but what give and it is not generous enough for eugenia to turn against its original tho he's incapable of it

by the same

madam

how can the unfortunate lysander ever hope for his divine eugenia pardon thus daily to torment her with his impertinence if she were not the best and most generous woman living
as for the character of a beau which you're pleas'd to honour me with pretty well guess whence you had it a very honest lady as lives mean mrs who din'd with me once at my lodging where night nor day you were not forgot
need not tell you that mrs as good a woman as lives since all that you recommend must be so
whenever she's a mind to oblige me most and render her house most agreeable she tells me many think her like eugenia but cou'd she make me believe so too she had done her business for as told her that was the way to make her house my prison for had eugenia been mistress of it cou'd with pleasure have been confin'd to it for ever
if you would do an act of charity as widows you know

are good for nothing else you would come up to town and help marry me to some old rich woman that would be sure to die quickly in order to the marrying a young one at least you wou'd speak a good word for me to my whom if ever was to marry my lord give her as you should me

hope fair widow after this long silence your pen will venture on some other subject besides business
if your letters were sometimes dash'd with love twere but a venial sin and what weekly pardon to some young women in the mal of your acquaintance from whom by my soul i've as good letters as those celebrated nuns letters
my two mistresses valeria and belinda serve under the name of polydorus but would be ten times more proud and happy to serve your ladiship under any title or name whereby might merit the character so long since engraven in the heart of

madam your humble slave lysander

by the same

madam

this day's post made me the happiest man living in receiving the honour of a most obliging letter from my dear eugenia who can never do any thing that is otherwise however did not know your modesty was so extream as to look on the smallest encomiums as flatteries tho your real merit keeps the greatest from being so confess it would be a real trouble to me that one whom so cordially honour shou'd the unfeign'd dictates of my soul for compliments
a devotion so justly grounded on merit can never be judg'd counterfeit for the glory of the sun and the benefits mankind reap'd from his beams were allow'd as sufficient arguments to justifie the persians adoration of him
your generous invitation of me so much to my own advantage that a dying man when he knows there are but two ways to go wou'd sooner refuse

an invitation to heaven
beg you madam make an experiment of your dominion over me in imposing some commands that you judge the most rigorous and that may appear as difficult as this is pleasing
wou'd fain see how you can be as well as give a proof of my pride in obeying you
as for london every thing that is worth a visit there will be gone the very minute you leave it and therefore till your return declare for an abdication of it and will here like another timon of athens live retir'd and in hatred of all mankind for your sexes sake

but now fair widow you must give me my revenge and let me give you advice in return of what have receiv'd from you tho mine promise you shall be more conscionable than yours was for you advise me to marry an old woman bless'd for ought know with a stinking breath rheumatisms coughs catarrhs false teeth and the other damn'd accomplishments which may entitle her to the honourable appellation of venerable but am

madam better natur'd in my choice for your ladiship and recommend to you a young man that prefers the widow to the jointure and leaves all but the treasure of her heart to others one who wou'd be confin'd to a desart if to be in heaven can be a confinement with her where the perpetual business of his life shou'd be immortal love and swear he that would not do all this and ten thousand times more is not worthy of her
such a one madam chuse for you and if that will not please forbear wedlock for ever as will do rather than take up with that reverend piece of antiquity you mention
in the mean time the only alms beg is your pity and pardon for

madam your most sincere oblig'd humble slave lysander

by the same

madam

to express the real sense have of all the noble favours conferr'd on me at your house during the long persecution gave you there were as impossible as to give your ladiship a full and perfect character of the pangs and tortures of mind have been under ever since my departure from the divine eugenia whose idea perpetually swims before my sight in all companies and places
madam i'm sensible have ten thousand pardons to ask for the extravagance of my passion in the presence of the divine eugenia but can appeal to heaven and my own conscience that never any prophane thought enter'd my breast reflecting on the divinity with so unfeign'd a zeal adore since no man living has that sacred opinion of the exalted honour vertue wit and beauty of any woman that have of my too dear and destructive eugenia

your caution madam of the bath might have been necessary to one that lov'd less than do the variety of company that place now affords with its other diverting amusements might have some influence over an amorous friend or common lover but as my passion is proportionable to the object so nothing on earth is diversion or pleasure to me but the thoughts of her love
can be alone ev'n in a crowd and therefore make it my endeavour to avoid so troublesome a solitude
good god madam what is there can do to shew how miserable am for your sake tis true madam my misery derives it self partly from my unworthiness but ah more much more from your not knowing what it is to love for who can have a real sense of another's pain but they who have felt the same how can the unfortunate lysander ever hope for one kind thought from his ador'd eugenia while her heart's not touch'd with his sufferings nay fortify'd against compassion by her being surrounded by none but his enemies some may think it a reflection on their friends to be refus'd if you shou'd honour any other with your favour but

them and others think it impossible that a passion for eugenia shou'd last an age since they never had merit enough to procure an hour's love for themselves
thus madam between the vanity of the old and the ignorance envy and impotent charms of the young may well expect to be sacrific'd but however shall have the satisfaction of being distinguish'd from the rest of your adorers by being at least your martyr

lysander
postscript starts here postscript

lysander madam can never banish nor lessen that passion you mention for eugenia yet my esteem of friendship is so great that if cou'd present you with a pillow of love to repose your charming head on it shou'd be stuff'd with friendship if with a landskip of love the shadows shou'd be friendship if with an embroidery the ground shou'd be friendship tho in the gardens of venus can never allow friendship to

be more than a which when the delicacies of the summer is over may be comfortable enough to the reverend old couple sitting by a in a long winter night ev'n as good as roasted apples

this day was blest with a letter from eugenia which comes far short of finishing my shroud a ream at least will modestly suffice to keep even death from blushing at himself and then for warmth another ream i'm sure you'll not deny when cold lysander begs

that heat and flame which now your beauty gives can then alone be by your wit supply'd
entomb'd in amber bees may boast their turn and wrapt in flames let pious martyrs burn
stretch'd in your letter death will be my triumph

embalm'd in sense who would not wish to die

and sense that comes from so divine a hand aegyptian mummies perish and decay but shrouds like mine will time it self wear out his scythe and every fleeting sand
one dram of body cannot here be lost but like a laid safely by when spring appears are fit to wear again
so true a resurrection will be rare the body with the soul
who then can doubt but the same passions too the same my love the same my mistress you

madam tho design'd these thoughts in prose yet in the ardor of writing they run into blank verse whether would or no
hope your ladyship receiv'd my last godly letter by which you may perceive can be devilishly devout upon occasion
the truth on't is have often wondred why all the young fellows of the town set up for atheism since they can be so much more conveniently lewd under the masque

of religion
if belinda in the letters i've communicated to your ladiship has behav'd her self in any kind disagreeable to her sex let me know it and i'll engage she shall mend her manners for the future
if you don't think she loves enough she shall grow jealous and never speak well of him her self nor suffer else to speak ill of him the surest sign of love in the world or if you think her too kind to her lover she shall set up for religion be very godly and very rail at profaneness and in a pious christian way enjoy somebody she likes better

your ladiship is pleased to censure my jealousie as incurable but pray madam be pleas'd to consider where men are apt to be jealous out of fondness as they are often jealous without a cause so they're as often satisfy'd without reason
i'm surpriz'd at eugenia's apology for her writing when there's no woman living but what might be proud to copy after her so free so easie so witty are her letters besides were it not so as mr congreve has it there would be more eloquence in your superscription

than in all tully and demosthenes his orations to me madam who am

your most constant and faithful humble servant

madam

ten thousand thanks to the divine eugenia for this morning's blessing of a letter full of the charms of her that sent em full of honour wit and nay more than providence cou'd spare to you without forming a mass of fools at the same time to retrieve the expence

on you the image of himself he stamp'd and every part he most divinely hit your eyes his glory and his power your wit

pardon me madam for this start of poetry for tho have no skill in it have yet a double pretence to the attempt both as lover and fidler
besides your ladiship's poetry the finest as well as the easiest in the world provoked me to return the debt not that presum'd madam that could pay you in the same sterling but in such birmigham coin as can compass
tho'i'm perswaded there's

so much of the poetick fire in yours that more of them would do with me what the hermetick fire does with metals transmute me into true standard gold and make my poetry as engaging as your charms that inspire me with a love as lasting as your slave

madam

how long must write and sigh in vain not one line not one word to the man that loves and adores you next heaven why shou'd grieve for her that hates me or write to her that scorns to answer me that after all her professions of friendship to her lysander forgets him now alphonso in the country as if she measur'd love by the proud weight of the person and not of the passion that after so many years of sincere love after the faithful service of the old patriarch's waiting turns him off for a as if you did it to fulfil what is written in giving the laborer that came the last hour the same wages with him that came the first
for my part madam never knew what it was to compound a debt with a mistress and for love to dwindle into friendship is not so much as to pay in the pound no madam time has not made me such a bankrupt and i've an

honester principle than to break when i'm so well stock'd with love

this is the third letter madam i've sent you since i've heard from you town and country are equally uneasie to me when hear not from eugenia when i'm depriv'd from the fight of her but shall find more frequent opportunity of seeing you designing don quixot like with my sanca panca to travel about in pursuit of adventures that may bring me to eugenia or death

madam

the letter this day's post brought me wou'd have surpriz'd any one but me whom you have so inur'd to injuries that look on my ordinary injustice as an obligation having had the honour to have receiv'd an hundred times more than this from your ladiship
was telling my friend last night that had read several encomiums on the gout feaver plague written by witty men to which thought the praise of women might be annex'd but little expected so home and serious a proof of the reasonableness of my jest
faith madam you have such ill success in the counsels of your allies that wou'd were you for once try my own
you seldom find confederates successful against a single foe who has to consult but his own will and pleasure
we take the field when we will march when we will and do what we will while the

different powers that make up a confederacy draw each a several way and by the slowness of their resolutions lose the opportunity of their fortune
however madam tis not your severity can destroy my passion must and will be yours one way or other no resolutions no unkindness can ever alter me
my love eugenia is like the appearance of a phoenix not to be seen but once in a thousand years my tongue never professes what my heart is not possess'd with
no no madam love is too noble a passion to be fool'd with
your laying addresses elsewhere to my charge is obliging for nothing cou'd please me more than your jealousie yet let me assure the divine eugenia that tis no easie matter for a man bred up in an adoration for twice seven years together to change his devotion and whatever little excursions might make all this time twas but to pray to others for your sake
and thus you see madam how little pains spare to win the empire of the world your love

if only to be happy be to live as all the brave and generous believe you'll in one year within my arms live more than all the tastless years you liv'd before one blast of breath will never then be lost but lip from lip each others soul be tost thus by a new philosophy we'll prove perpetual motion and eternal love

dearest eugenia adieu never again be so cruel to throw away any more fruitless advice about changing my address for tis impossible shou'd ever be other than

your constant slave lysander

to my

richmond march

here am at last madam to shew you the force of my resolution and here positively stay till saturday nay don't know but may stretch it to monday for if once get into town again the lord knows when get out on't and i'm afraid shan't suck so much of this heavenly air in two days as may possibly stand in need of for don't find my legs of half that importance to me they us'd to be
half a mile up hill makes em grumble cursedly
have a scoundrel pair of bellows too that puff and blow and make a damnable splutter
in short the present scituation of my affairs are such can give but a very scurvy account of the pertest part about me

that things may mend is my hope and my comfort madam for were they to hang long thus twere no great loss either to my self or other folks if were hang'd too
possibly your ladiship may

be of my opinion if you are pray toss me a short prayer into your for my
would have begg'd one from a catholick lady in the next room who is puzzling over a long lewd account she's to make up against easter but she's so taken up with her sins and her crucifix she cares not if were damn'd
if am not hope she will for she's so ugly desire may never be in the same place with her again

postscript starts here the madam is to hand this to the and he's just starting so if my letter's too short tis he's the this time not

to

honest dick

have not only heard of but born a part in some of your frolicks yet never observed any so extravagant as gave me reason to apprehend you wou'd ever be so mad as to marry
sure the devil is in thee or her for without fascination this miracle could never be wrought to be very sick of love is no wonder but that can't last long the raging feaver must pass or kill
your fate is soon determin'd a few days bring it to its crisis and is it not better dying quietly in your own sheets than in a whining wife's arms you can never live in charity with her ten days together unless you are a stricter christian than take you or think it possible for one of nineteen to be
experience experience has convinc'd me that the difference between women consists more in our capricious humours and the sense of variety than any intrinsick goodness not very common to their sex
the novelty may please tis true but after the first

week's enjoyment a wife is eternally the same the ruine of your estate and the disquiet of your bed
if she live three years she'll spend more than her fortune in cloaths
if she bring you any children these are so many fresh additions to your misfortunes creating torments if they live and grief if they die
which of thy sins dick has been so black in it self or so heinous in its circumstances so frequently repeated or so long unrepented of as to deserve so heavy so lasting a damnation you that cou'd never like a woman above a week and chang'd your mistresses faster than they did their lodgings how alas do you think it possible not to be miserable under this pagan yoak tho don't pretend to the spirit of prophecy yet dare engage you'd give five times her estate within the year to be at liberty again
alas dick this is not a confinement that ten guinea's will bear you out of but what is the greatest mischief twill last all your life
the knowing that we can't alter our condition believe is the most sensible affliction that can befal us
you know the story of the man that broke his heart with the

thoughts of being forbidden to walk without the walls of a great city tho he had never stirr'd a foot out of it before
besides a husband is the most insipid character of all mankind never pleasing and seldom pleased tormented in his own person and more feelingly in that of his children who are continually whipp'd and beaten to be reveng'd of his unkindness or to provoke his anger
be sober once in thy life and renounce the thoughts of so fatal a consequence
why will you affect drinking out of horn when you have so much plate you had best shew this to you fair charmer and demonstrate the powers of her eyes by resisting so wholsom and seasonable advice
if you think fit do so had rather lose her than not shew my own integrity and wou'd refuse your friendship if might not shew my own

to

lovely object of my solicitous desires

tis impossible for me to resist the charms of your bewitching face and if you are not less cruel than you're fair shall be eternally miserable
heaven knows with what an unusual throbbing my heart was seiz'd when first saw you
and who indeed could behold without a tender concern the beautifullest creature that nature ever made or our eyes at least beheld and from whence cou'd proceed so unaccountable a disorder unless from love it is not superfluous to confess a flame cou'd not possibly avoid
and what needs there more to convince the world of my passion than the assurance had seen you love is so charming in its birth that we readily yield to his softer impulses but so powerful withal that we as vainly oppose them
in your company consists my happiness and am wretched when am forc'd from your feet
could my dear dorinda know with what anguish and horror pass

every tedious hour away while at this distance from her she wou'd doubtless wish my condition less wretched
common gratitude obliges us to pity if we can't redress the miseries we cause
since this is the only happiness can at present enjoy be so indulgent as to permit it for why shou'd you refuse me a felicity that can stand you but in two pence if the declaring my passion you imputed to me as a crime the torments it creates me are a sufficient punishment and you are reveng'd of all my faults in my own despair

a letter of aeneas sylvius who was afterwards pope pius the second to his father about a whom he sent to him
translated from the latin by mr brown
aeu sylv
oper
edit
basil

you sent me word in your last that you could not tell whether you were to rejoyce or grieve at the late present that providence made me of a son
for my part see reason enough for the former but not the least pretence for the latter for tell me what prettier sport is there than for a man to beget his own likeness or what more refreshing sight can there be on this side
heaven than to see one's table well stock'd with olivebranches as for my self without blushing own to you that tis an unspeakable pleasure to me to find that have not bestow'd my pains in a barren soil and daily return my thanks to heaven for

sending me no cloven present no whimpering silly girl but a fine chopping lusty boy who will help to divert you and ray mother with his innocent pratling
now sir if you took any satisfaction at my birth why shou'd not the cockies or your old heart dance upon this occasion or why shou'd you not be as well pleas'd to behold my picture in a but perhaps you'll tell me that your conscience is some what uneasie because the poor child was begotten in sin and out of the pale of matrimony
if the shooe pinches you there must ask you a few civil questions before we part
pray sir what materials was compos'd of as take it am not made of stone or iron or any such unrelenting ingredients
you begot me true flesh and blood and if have committed any crime in making use of my parts i'll e'en place it to your score for i'll swear had all the peccant utensils from you
in the next place do but consider how it was with your self at my years you know well enough without my refreshing your memory for you that you never lay under the scandal of a fumbler
am your own lawful son no blot

to your family hope no eunuch or any thing like it
neither am hypocrite enough to pretend to more sanctity than the rest of my neighbours
frankly own have been a trespasser a vile abominable trespasser in my time but to my great comfort david and solomon went the same road before me and as am modest in my own nature a curse light on me if ever desire to be thought holier than king david or wiser than his son
if tis a sin it can say abundance of shrewd things for it self it can plead antiquity and universality and quotes the lord knows how many texts out of the new and old testament and to deal plainly with you don't believe there's one man between the two poles unless he has a very scurvy confounded body indeed that has not at one time or another been guilty of it in thought or deed
this corruption if it may be call'd a corruption for a man to imploy his natural talent is of all countries and regions but under the rose sir why shou'd copulation be treated with such ill language as generally tis or why shou'd our casuists so furiously condemn it since nature that never does any thing in vain

has interwoven this appetite with our very constitutions and inspired the whole creation with an eternal desire to continue their own species but suppose you'll reply that there are certain limits within which tis lawful and that this action ought never to be done without the church's consent
well for once let us take it for granted that as man ought never to get up and ride without the priests benediction but how does this mend the matter was there never any sin do you think committed within the matrimonial sheets hope old gentleman you'll not advance such false doctrine as that is
there are fix'd rules too for our eating and drinking but what man in a thousand is such a slavish coxcomb as to be confin'd to them some rascals may tell you they were never guilty of sin and demurely wipe their mouths after they have said it but hate all lyars and since carry human infirmities about me scorn to conceal or deny them so much for this point
but because you seem to distrust that other people have had a finger in the pye and wou'd fain be satisfied whether the child really belongs

to me or no pray sir be pleas'd to take this short history of the whole affair
had been envoy at strasburg some two years and as it happen'd had no great business upon my hands when a woman newly arrived from england who had youth and beauty enough to please a nicer palate than mine chanced to come to the same inn where lodged she spoke the italian tongue perfectly well and had a long conversation with her in that language which was so much the more entertaining to me because so little expected to meet one that understood italian in those parts of the world
in short what with her wit and beauty she gain'd an absolute ascendant over my heart so that as often as beheld her cou'd not help thinking on the famous cleopatra who chiefly with the gaiety and charms of her discourse made such a pair of asses of julius coesar and mark antony
thought to my self who can blame such an inconsiderable diminutive fellow as am for doing what the most illustrious heroes of antiquity have justified by their own examples sometimes supported my self by the precedent of moses sometimes of

aristotle and sometimes by famous instances in the christian church
to make short of my story was passionately in love with this belle tramontane and attempted her with all the rhetorick was master of
but she deaf to my vows and passion slighted all my protestations so that for three days an age in the chronicles of love found had made little or no progress in her affections
whether this was the effect of her vertue her fear or discretion won't be positive but am inclin'd to the latter
for as it appear'd she stood in some awe of the house from whom she expected certain kindnesses

the fatal night now approach'd and next morning early she was to pursue her journey
what fears what apprehensions reached my soul least the quarry should escape me threw my self down at her feet embraced her knees and conjur'd her not to bolt her door adding that in the silence of the night wou'd steal to her chamber and give her the last convictions that was her most devoted vassal
she refus'd to comply with my desires stood much upon her virtue and gave me not the least hopes of succeeding

still importun'd her upon the same chapter but she still made me the same answer and insisted upon her vertue
well when all the family was gone to bed said to my self shall see whether the lady has done as desir'd her or no all women are riddles perhaps she has since thought better of the matter and after all tis no great trouble to try the experiment
finding all was hushed groped my way to her chamber in the dark the door was shut but not bolted so in came rush'd into bed and after a little foolish struggling got possession of her body the fruit of which night's work was this hopeful boy
this merry scene befel me about the beginning of february and nine months after my dear lovely bedfellow whose name was betty dropt in two and was deliver'd of the babe
this account had from her own mouth at basil where it was my good fortune to meet with her again
at first thought she had invented this story on purpose to wheedle a sum of money out of me and gave no great heed to it but then considering that the enjoyment of her at strasburg had not cost me a farthing

but only put me to the expence of a few foolish oaths and so forth which are easily coined in a lover's mint began to alter my opinion
she acted before upon a generous principle of love and no indirect mercenary ends therefore why should now suspect her integrity besides the time and all other circumstances agreed so well that could no longer doubt of what she told me especially it being at a juncture when she cou'd expect no great matters from me
these reasons induced me to believe that the child was begot with the sweat of my brows therefore pray sir take him into your family bestow some little greek and latin upon the young rogue breed him up in the fear of his maker and afford him shelter in a garret till he's big enough to find the way to his daddy

farewell

finis

NOTABLE discourse of the happinesse of this our age, and of the ingratitude of men to God for his benefites: Written in Latine by that godly learned man Iohn Riuius, and now newly Englished for the comfort, and commoditie of the vnlearned, by W. W. Student.
This is life euerlasting, that men knowe thee to be the onely verie God, and whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ.
To the Right Honorable M. Doctour Wilson, one of the principall Secretaries to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie and of her Highnesse most honorable priuie Counsell.
W. W. wisheth increase of all godlinesse in this present life, and in the life to come eternall happinesse in heauen.
THE wonderfull varietie, and diuersitie of opinions and iudgements amongst the Philosophers concerning mans summum bonum, or chiefest happinesse in this life, is not vnknowne to your Honour, and other learned men, how that some said it did consist onely in vertue, othersome in beautie, othersome in honour, othersome in wealth, othersome (and that no small summe) in pleasure, and some in a certeine mixture, or medlie of all these.
It were needlesse to reckon vp in this place all their idle fansies, fond dreames about this one point.
Howbeit, would certifie the simpler sort of this thing, how that all of them erred, and wandered in bywayes, how that euerie seuerall sect and familie of Philosophers shot farre wide of the marke.
They became vaine in their thoughtes, and their foolish heart was full of darknesse.
When they professed themselues to be wise, they beecame fooles.
We Christians, that haue bene trained vp in Christes schole, haue learned
a better profession of our Maister, and Sauiour Iesus Christ.
We know, and are taught so to say, that God
We are instructed, and so we stedfastly beleeue, that the onely true felicitie of this our life, and the true happinesse of this our age, standeth in the publishing, and preaching of Christes Gospell, which is to the Iewes a stumbling blocke, to the Graecians foolishnesse, and to the Papistes new learning: but in deede the power of God to the saluation, and the wisedome of God to the instruction of as many as are called both of the Iewes, Graecians, and Papistes.
This glorious Gospell of our God was first preached here on earth by our Redeemer, and Sauiour Christ himselfe: then, after his ascension, it was carried into all partes of the worlde by the Apostles, and their successours, with such successe, that Christes spirituall kingdome was by the scepter of his worde enlarged farre and wide.
Which thing the deadly enimie of mankind Sathan greatly enuying, knowing that the flourishing state of Christes kingdome would be the decaie, and downefall of his, laboured by all meanes possible, to beare downe his scepter, and scepter bearers by force and violence, which thing he after a sorte brought to passe, by raising vp the ten bloudie persecutions against the Christians vnder the ten Tyrantes, or Emperours of Rome.
But the Diuell, seeing that this his former policie would not preuaile, seeing that the Christians the more they were tormented for their faith, the more they grewe, and multiplied, deuised to deale no more by violence, and bloudshed: but chaunging himselfe into an Angel of light, sought meanes how in time of peace he might withdrawe men by little and little from the true Religion of Christ, to the counterfeit and hypocriticall religion of Antichrist.
This craftie counsell, and pestilent practise pleased the subtile Serpent well, which wrought
this effect, that it eclipsed, and diminished the fulnesse, beautifull light of Christes kingdome, which was onely mainteined by the sworde of the spirit, that is to say, by the worde of God.
And because he might the more easily leade the people out of the way of trueth, his purpose was wholy hitherto bent, to ouerwhelme the candle vnder the bushell, to darken the light of the Gospell, which he brought accordingly to passe, by corrupting, and infecting the Priesthood with the glorious pompe,
and vanities of the worlde, with the wanton delightes, and vaine pleasures of this present life.
Then, euen then, he set Antichrist of Rome in his royall seate as his vicar,
and lieftenant generall, there to rule, and reigne as God of this world in the children of vnbeliefe, bewitching them with strong delusions, that they shoulde beleeue lies, that all they might be damned, which beleeued not the trueth, but had pleasure in vnrighteousnesse.
This is that man of sinne (by which is ment not one particular
man, but a succession of men, as by the beare in Daniel is not ment onely one King of the Persians, but a succession of Kinges,) this say is that man of sinne, and that aduersarie that exalteth himselfe aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he doth sit as God in the Temple of God, shewing himselfe that he is God.
This is that wicked man, whose comming is by the effectuall working of Sathan with all power, and signes, and lying woonders, and in all deceiueablenesse of vnrighteousnesse among them that perishe, because they receiued not the loue of the trueth, that they might be saued.
By this meanes Sathan lulled (as it were) the worlde a sleepe, for the space of these seuen hundred yeeres last past.
Now some man will maruell much how the Pope should growe to such an vnbridled authoritie, as he hath gotten.
Surely we can assigne no other cause but this: such was the will of God, and such was the
depth of his secrete iudgement for the contempt of his Gospell Was it not, pray you, reuealed to S. Iohn, that
the purple whoore of Babylon shoulde make all the Kinges and Princes of the earth, and the inhabitantes thereof to drinke of the golden cuppe of wine, full of the abhominations, and filthinesse of her fornication? The verie beginning, and foundation of Antichristes kingdome was laied euen in the Apostles time.
For S. Paule writ to the Thessalonians, that the mysterie of iniquitie
began then to woorke: but it was then hindered by the brightnesse, and puritie of doctrine receiued in the Primatiue Church.
Afterwardes it grewe vp by degrees, and specially by three steppes.
errors of the heretikes in the East Church, which Chrysostome doth call the armies of Antichrist.
Secondly, by the lamentable contention, and emulation amongst the Christian Bishoppes in the Orientall partes.
Thirdly, by the superstitious deuotion (for will not call it liberall donation) of Princes, and Emperours.
For, after that the wicked parricide Phocas, Emperour of Constantinople,
had geuen the Primasie, or name of vniuersall Bishop vnto Boniface the third, the Popes authoritie, or rather tyrannie increased excedingly.
Then they sought not onely to be Lordes within themselues, but also to be aboue all higher powers: yea, aboue the Emperour himselfe.
This kingdome of Antichrist from that time forward grew mightily, specially vnder the Emperours of Constantinople: and namely, vnder the Emperour Constantinus Pogonatus or Barbatus: and vnder the Emperours of Germanie Henries, and Frederikes.
Now in this time of darkenesse it is much to be maruelled, vnto what vile slauerie, and thraldome.
Emperours and Princes were brought by the Bishop of Rome.
them, being resolutely persuaded by the Romish Cleargie, that the Pope was Christes vicar, vicegerent: yea,
One waited at his gate barefoote, and barelegge: another was tied fast with chaines vnder the Popes table, there to picke vp crumbes like a dogge: another suffered him to set his feete vpon his necke: another held his stirrop, when the Popes holinesse vauted vpon his horse: another was thrust into a Monasterie, and made a Monke.
deede the Churche of Rome, the whoore of Babylon, was gloriously in open rule: but the true Churche of Christ was not in any visible gouernment, no more than it was in the time of Elias the Prophet.
And this was, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled and founde true, which say, that there should be an Apostasie, or defection
from the faith, that is, a generall reuolting from true Religion: that iniquitie shoulde haue the vpper hand: that no man should haue the libertie of his life, but he that should take vpon him the character, or mark of the beast.
this day crie with open mouth most impudently, The Catholike church, The Catholike Church, saying, that it hath alwayes bene to be sene at Rome.
They tell vs with shame inough, that the Pope can not erre, that his faith is Catholike, and pure without all blot, or blemish, and that if we beleeue iumpe as he beleeueth, we shall surely be saued.
But we will neuer beleeue Antichrist, nor run to Rome (albeit sometime a faithfull citie) to inquire after our faith, and Religion.
We wote well, that now it is, and hath bene a great while, the sinke of all sinne and iniquitie in the world, the verie seate, and habitation of Antichrist himselfe.
We will not haue that proude Italian Priest to be our Doctour, and generall Scholemaister, a man made of all abhominations, and whoredomes.
of our faith vpon the glorious name of any mortall man whatsoeuer.
We see the end of all Poperie to be ignorance.
We see they derogate, and detract all from Christ and his Passion, and attribute their saluation to Masses, to mens merites, to Saintes prayers, to Pilgrimages, to vowes of virginitie, to their owne good workes, and to a thousand other trifling toyes.
We see they preferre mens traditions, inuentions before the truth of Gods word.
We can shewe, if neede be, at what time, and by which Popes euerie parcell of Papistrie was deuised.
He that will make a true Anatomie of it, and examine it from point to point, shall finde, that it tendeth wholy to gaine, and no whit to godlinesse.
To be short, we knowe by the Scriptures of God, that their Religion which forbiddeth marriage and meates, is a doctrine of Diuels.
ages, in which times notwithstanding God had his Church, though not alwayes subiect to mans senses: in which ages God raised vp euermore some good men, which inueihed bitterly against the Popes intollerable
pride, and tyrannie, as namely Hilarie Bishop of Vienna in Fraunce, Paulus Cretensis, and Iohannes Lampeon, both Bishoppes denied his supremasie, the Church of Rauenna in Italie, would not acknowledge the Pope for her head.
Nilus Archbishop of Thessalonica writ a learned booke against the Popes primasie.
Afterwardes in Italie, yea euen in Rome Arnoldus Brixianus, an eloquent man, oppugned stoutely the Popes primasie, and tyrannie.
Counsels, and Synods condemned the Popes supremasie, after whom God raised vp here in England a valiant, stoute souldier Iohn Wickleffe, and in Bohemia Iohn Hus, Hierome of Prage, with many others, as histories record and witnesse.
But at the length, when it pleased the great goodnesse,
the world then drowned in darknesse, he renewed the heauenlie light of his Gospell, by which Antichrist of Rome should be reuealed, and by little and little vtterly destroyed.
Then he raised vp mightie Capteines to make warre against that spirituall Pharao, whom he appointed like Moses, and Aaron, to safe conduct vs out of the land of Aegypt, out of the house of bondage, out of the sorowfull seruitude of Poperie, in comparison of which, that Aegyptiacall slauerie was great libertie.
To this end and purpose he raised vp in this most happie, and blessed age, sundrie learned Diuines, as namely, Martin Luther,
Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Caluine, Peter Martyr, Bucer, Bullenger, Gualter, Theodore Beza, Chemnisius, Hemingius, Riuius, Zanchius, Daneus, Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, Bradford, M. Iewell, M. Nowell, M. Iohn Foxe, with infinite others both Englishmen, Scots, Frenchmen, Germanes, Italians, Spaniards, and Danes.
Surely this the happie age, which Chrysostome fortold, speaking of the last times: Ad nullam rem fugient, nisi ad Scripturas: alioqui incident in abhominationem desolationis.
Then (saith he) will they flee vnto nothing, but vnto the Scriptures: otherwise they shall fall into the abhomination of desolation.
To whom agreeth S. Hierome, writing vpon the Prophet Nahum.
plainely of our time thus: Ecclesia post eosdem dies, quibus deprimitur, tamen circa finem mundi grandi praedicationis virtute roborabitur: The Church (saith he) after those dayes, wherin she is depressed, and holden downe, shall for all that about the end of the worlde be strengthened with the great power of preaching.
Which thing is come nowe to passe in these dayes, as we may see, how that the preaching of the Gospell hath greatly preuailed against all the raging persecution of the Papistes: the Lordes name be praised for it.
As oft as we thinke vpon this Gospell, we dare auouch, that these latter times
are better times, that this age is a golden age.
For if Aristides the iust was called Graecorum foelicitas, that is, The happinesse of the Graecians, we may more worthily call Christ our felicitie: and if the age, wherein he liued, was called Aureaaetas, that is, golden age, because iustice flourished in it, verelie we may more iustly call this our age a golden age, because the glorious Gospell of God shineth nowe most clearely in the eyes, and soundeth most shrilly in the eares of all Israel.
before the Lorde his louing kindnesse, and his wonderous woorkes before the sonnes of men.
Thus we haue seene the chiefest happinesse of this our age, to be the preaching of the Gospell of God amongest vs.
part also of our happinesse at this day may consist in the
garnishing of good learning, which is come to a wonderfull ripenesse.
And not onely liberall artes, and sciences excell nowe more, than euer they did, by reason of Printing (which as wise men say is of all Gods externall benefites one of the greatest) but also Manuall or Mechanicall trades are come to such a perfection, as the like was neuer heard, or read of before.
But because there is no great doubt of this, which our aduersaries also doe confesse, will stand no longer vpon it.
In the happinesse of this our age, the Lord in his manifold
mercie hath made vs Englishmen most happie of all other nations vnder the Sunne.
For first, whereas before we sate in darknesse, and in the shadow of death, he hath blessed vs with the light of his holy Gospell, so that now we are a people set at libertie, to the end we should
shewe foorth the vertues of him, that hath called vs out of darkenesse into his maruellous light.
Secondly, he hath blessed vs with a gratious, and a religious Prince, a Phoenix amongst women kinde, vnder whom we haue
had the Gospell in great peace these twentie yeares: the Lorde frame our obedience to it in all holinesse, and blesse our Souereigne with a long, prosperous, and zealous reigne ouer vs. Thirdly, the God of all peace hath blessed vs with a straunge, wonderfull, and miraculous peace.
For we sit here quietly, when as all the worlde beside (almost) is in an vprore.
Our Halcionij dies, our calme and peaceable dayes doe farre surpasse and excell the ciuil peace, either of Solomon in Israel, or of Augustus in Rome.
Fourthly, God hath blessed vs with maruellous prosperitie, and plentie of all things, such as our enimies enuie at.
God graunte that England may bee thankfull for all these spirituall, and temporall blessinges: and that Italie, Spaine, France, Flanders, and other nations, may in his mercie bee partakers of his Gospell, and of our peace with the fulnesse thereof, rather than in his iustice so to punish vs, as to make vs againe companions of their spirituall darkenesse in the last place, and greatest measure.
This most happie state of ours, forreigne nations doe enuie, and specially Papistes, who haue banded them selues together in an holie league (as they tearme it) to roote out Gods Gospell from amongst vs, and to bring in againe Mariana tempora.
bee thanked, their Kalendar doeth fowly faile them: their golden day (or rather bloud red day) in their Rubricke is not yet come: beseech almightie God, who is able to confounde their deuises, and wicked practises against his Churche, that it may neuer come.
Your Honour is not ignorant, howe that there bee some, whose wisest parte in them is their hoarie haires, who so highly aduance, and commend the former ages, that like vnthankfull wretches, they vtterly mislike, and discommend this our age, wherein we liue.
In this consideration thought good to oppose, set this booke
of Riuius against them, entreating of the happinesse of this our Age: whiche Argument, as thought it woulde bee most acceptable and gratefull to your Honour: so now am bold to present it vnto your fauourable protection, as a seale and sure testimonie of my louing duetie towardes your Honour, not doubting but that you will mightily mainteine, and defend the happinesse of this our age, against all malicious Papistes, carnall Gospellers, and wrangling Sycophantes.
This trust you will doe, being enabled (as you are) not onely with great learning, but also with great authoritie, which your Honour hath well deserued.
The Lorde giue vnto you, as he did vnto Solomon, an vnderstanding heart to iudge aright to discerne betwixt good and bad, betwixt happinesse and miserie.
The Lorde keepe and continue your Honour safe, and sounde, that you may be still a stay vnto Religion, a godlie wise Counseller vnto your Prince: finally, a fauourable Patrone, and friendly Maecenas to all good learning, and learned men.
ALbeit (good Christian Reader) this present discourse bee a continuate style, wherein one thing necessarily dependeth vpon an other: and albeit it bee not diuided, and distinguished into Chapters, as the common sorte of bookes published at this day are: notwithstanding trust that those Marginall notes, which haue set to the booke, as certeine Statuae Mercuriales, are able, as a skilfull guide, to direct thee vnto all the particular pointes of this booke, as well as if it had bene parted into Chapters.
haue also added for thy comforte, and commoditie, the places, and sentences of Scripture, which the Author had not quoted at all.
This booke will (I hope) bee a good staffe, and stay to thy faith amongst these strifes, and contentions, about Religion in these dayes.
There is nothing in it but sounde, and sincere doctrine, which wee professe: and a detection of the wandering wayes of the Church of Rome.
Bee alwayes thankfull to our good God for restoring to vs his Gospell, which is, and ought to be, the onely ioy of our dayes.
If thou doest finde thy faith by this excellent treatise any whit encreased, and confirmed, the Author, and the Translatour thinke them selues sufficiently recompensed, and rewarded.
See that thou courteously accept their zealous endeuors, giue all the glorie to God alone, whose name bee blessed for euer, Amen.
please all men in all thinges, not seeking mine owne profite, but the profite of many, that they might bee saued.
To the noble and famous man Iohn Schlenitz, his deare friende, Iohn Riuius sendeth greeting.
haue desired, and besought in prayer of our most gratious, and omnipotent God to come to passe, to witte, that the Papistes might at some time or other, bee so euidently manifested, and disclosed to the whole worlde, and to all mortall men, of what nation soeuer, to this end, and purpose, that the complaintes of our men against them might not seeme any whit vndeserued on their behalfe: that now at the length doe both incredibly reioyce, that haue by the singular benefit of God obteined, also render vnto the immortall God as greate thankes as can for it.
For, when as certeine of the Papistes now of late dayes did painte out old superstitions with such deceiptfull shadowes (as it were) and counterfeite collours, that euen
the very wisest, much more the foolish, and vnwarie multitude, was by that meanes brought into errour, verely feared to what issue the matter would grow vnto at length: yea, and was greatly affraid, lest that they, which haue a good while agoe bene reclaimed from impious superstition, to the godlie, and sincere worship of God, and to the pure religion of Christ, being by little, and little bewitched by the writinges of our aduersaries, woulde againe (like blinde men) rush headlong, and fall backward into their former darknesse of ignorance, errours.
For certeine men haue now begonne with no little care and cunning, to set a faire glasse vpon old superstitions, and with comelie wordes to cloake and couer the faultes, and vices of the Papistes.
But now at this day, seeing that our aduersaries doe shew
they goe aboute, what they looke at, what they ayme at, what they shoote at, and seeing that now wee may almost feele, and groape (as it were) with our handes the fond counselles, and wicked practises of the vngodlie Papistes, doe see there is no greate daunger, and thinke that wee neede not to feare so much any more, lest they can induce, and bring any man hereafter so easily into errour, vnlesse hee bee starke blinde, out of his right wittes.
For who now doth not see, that the aduersaries of sounde and wholesome doctrine, doe endeuour to take quite away, to pluck out of all mens heartes, yea after a sorte to burie wholy, and altogether to ouerwhelme the very sacred, and holy religion of Christe? For thus they teache Ad verbum, Woorde for woorde, will put nothing to of mine owne.
That faith (say they) by which a man doth stedfastly
beleeue, and assuredly trust to haue his sinnes forgiuen him for Christes sake, and to possesse euerlasting saluation, hath no testimonie, or witnesse at all in the Scriptures, yea it is cleane against it.
What else? If any man shall say, that the iustifying faith is nothing else, but a stedfast trust in Gods mercie, pardoning our sinnes for Christes sake: or that, that only confidence is the meane, whereby wee shalbe iustified, let him bee accursed, Item: If any man shall say, that to the obteining
of saluation, it is necessarie for euery man to beleeue assuredly, and without all doubting of his owne infirmitie, that his sinnes are forgiuen him, let him bee accursed.
What, is there any more of this stuffe? Yea: If any man shall say, that a man is absolued from his sinnes, and iustified, for that he doth certeinly beleeue, that hee is absolued, or that no man is truely iustified, but hee that doeth beleeue himselfe to be iustified, and that our absolution, and iustification is fully perfected, and finished onely by this faith, let him bee accursed, tremble, and quake to rehearse such deuilish decrees of vngodlie men.
They will haue faith to bee onely a simple credulitie, and a
bare knowledge of the historie of Christ, and not also a stedfast
trust, and beliefe in Christ, as S. Paul in all his Epistles vnderstandeth it.
They woulde haue vs continually to doubte of the good will of God towardes vs.
They denie that a man is iustified only by trust, and beliefe in the mercie of God, pardoning our sinnes for Christes sake: that is, they denie that a man is iustified, Gratis, freely (as S. Paul saith) euen by the grace of
They denie that faith is necessarie for all men to the obteining of pardon, and remission of their sinnes.
They denie that faith is alwayes necessarie to absolution from our sinnes: that is (to speake more plainly) they denie that wee ought necessarily to beleeue the Gospell.
For, pray you, what other thing is absolution, but the voice
of the Gospell, sounding by the minister of the Church, by which voice that remission of sinnes, promised to the penitent in the Gospell, is priuately, and particularly applied to euery mans conscience.
And seeing that our Sauiour Christ, in the Gospell of S. Marke, flatly commaundeth both, namely to repent,
and to beleeue the Gospell, beholde heere the intollerable boldnesse, or rather impudencie of our aduersaries.
For they very willingly graunt the one, that we ought to repent: but verily they doe so stoutly denie the other: namely, that
wee ought to beleeue the Gospell, that is, the preaching of forgiuenesse of sinnes, that they accurse, and condemne euery one that affirmeth this to bee true.
Christ saith: Credite Euangelio, that is, Beleeue the Gospell: but these men say quite contrary: If any man (say they) shall affirme, that in absolution of sinnes wee must beleeue the Gospell, let him bee accursed.
Now what an absurde thing also is this their Anathema? If any man shall say, that if grace bee lost through sinne, faith also is alwayes together lost with it: or that, that faith, which doth remaine, is not a true faith, although it bee not a liuely faith: or that hee, which hath faith without charitie, is not a Christian: let him bee accursed.
Here, to be briefe, they affirme that adulterers, manquellers, extortioners, and such like, (whome S. Paule denieth euer
to be heires of the kingdome of God) persisting still in their
sinne and wickednesse, may conceiue some hope, and trust of their saluation, and may promise vnto them selues, that God for Christes sake, will be mercifull· and fauorable vnto them: for that is it which we call, To beleeue.
be true, then surely the Apostle S. Paule is in an errour.
But if it bee impietie to graunt that the Apostle erred, then they them selues doe erre, and are deceiued, and doe manifestly teach a falshood.
In the meane while (such is the miserable blindenesse of those mens mindes,) they doe not see, and perceiue how that they speake contraries.
there is any liuely faith in heinous sinners, and wicked offenders, Ergo it necessarily followeth, that their faith is a dead faith, such an one as the Diuels also may haue in them, according as S. Iames witnesseth.
be founde true, which is dead? Here doe beleeue they will coyne, and bring foorth out of their owne braine (as Iupiter brought forth Minerua out of his head) a new definition of faith.
But let vs briefly haue a viewe also of other of their Diuelish decrees.
reteine, and receiue whatsoeuer the chaire of Peter hath giuen out, doeth giue out, and shall giue out concerning faith, and religion.
Hereby you may easily vnderstand, how greate the credite of the Church of Rome, and the authoritie of the Apostolicall seate is amongst them.
fastes, feastes, and abstinence from meates, and many other thinges, doe bind a man in conscience to obserue, and keepe them, Etiam extra casum scandali, yea without the case of offence to any.
But what followeth? Christ (say they) doeth giue, and graunt many thinges
vnto vs here on earth, through the merites, and intercession of Saintes, which otherwise he would not bestowe vppon vs: Wherefore they doe verie holily and religiously, which with a deuoute pietie, and godlinesse doe visite those places, which are
dedicated to them, and which by this meanes seeke for helpe at their handes.
Here you see that they doe allowe prayer to the deade, and Pilgrimages, instituted for religion, and deuotion sake.
What say they else? The vse of images (say they) is
acceptable, and gratefull to God, and we doe well to fall downe flat before them, calling vpon the Saintes whome they represent.
These verely are plaine, and euident inough, neither neede they any larger explication.
(say they) that there is after this life a Purgatorie for soules departed, in which is payed the punishment, as yet due for sinnes.
Notwithstanding they may be succoured, and holpen by the sacrifice of the altar, by prayer, by fasting, by almes deedes, and by other workes of the liuing, as also by indulgencies, that they may the sooner by that meanes be deliuered, and set free from thence.
Now verely that appeareth plainely, which saide in the beginning, what the aduersaries, and enimies of the Gospell goe about: namely to take quite away at once all faith, all godlinesse, all holinesse, all religion, yea the pure and sincere
seruice of God: finally, to burie and ouerwhelme Christ him selfe, the authour of mans saluation: also to thrust vpon vs their owne vaine dreames, the foolish, fantasticall, and doting deuises of men: yea doctrines of Diuels (as the Apostle calleth
them) to the end that we should herafter direct all the actions of our life by the rule, and squire of the Popes will, nothing at all regarding either what God willeth, and commaundeth, or what he prohibiteth, and forbiddeth vs to doe: whome the
Papistes (because they are flat Epicures) doe neither wishe to be mercifull vnto them, nor feare him when he is displeased with them.
But let vs render immortall thankes vnto God, the eternall father of our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ, which hath suffered the follie, and madnesse of the Papistes to be so manifested at this day, that no man now can doubt any more, what opinion, and persuasion all of vs ought to haue of
For they are indeed deceiuers of mens mindes (as S. Paule saith vnto Titus) and men that turne away from the
trueth: yea verely (as the same Apostle saith vnto Timothie) men that resist the trueth, as Iannes, and Iambres withstood Moses.
madnesse of those Magicians was then euident to all: so the madnesse of the Papistes is now reuealed to all men.
For as they are indeed, so they are also accounted of all men, seducers,
and deceiuers, the enimies of the crosse of Christ, Epicures, which haue their bellie for their God, which minde earthly thinges, which bewitch men, that they may not beleeue the trueth.
Wherefore, seeing that this madnesse of the Papistes is now manifested to all men, no man can doubt, but that no Christian ought to haue any societie, and fellowshippe with
And if perhaps any man heretofore hath doubted of it, let him now verely cease to stand in doubt any more, knowing the impietie of their doctrine, by which they labour to ouerthrow quite from the foundation our Christian Common wealth.
Fooles they are, and mad men, which (with the Giants) wage warre with God him selfe, and hope to haue
good successe in the matter, seeing that it is moste truely spoken of the wise man, There is no counsell, nor wisdome against the Lord.
But that may come now at the length vnto that, for which haue spoken these thinges, of the follie, and madnesse
of the Papistes: we ought woorthily all of vs to giue as greate thankes to the immortall God, as wee can either conceiue in minde, or vtter in woordes, for the renewing of Ecclesiasticall doctrine, and for the disclosing of almost innumerable errours, superstitions, and vices, commonly tearmed abuses.
Now, what kinde of errours, and how great haue beene heretofore in the Church, if any man be ignorant of them, he may with a litle labour coniecture what they are, euen out of the bookes, which the enimies of the Gospell haue written, out of which wee haue brought foorth these few for a shew.
They doe not vnderstand at all what faith is, what the Gospell is,
men ought onely to beleeue whatsoeuer the chaire of Rome hath deliuered out in tradition, doth deliuer out, and shall deliuer out.
They will haue men to make choyce of meates (contrarie to the doctrine of the Apostle,) yea without the case of offence,
They doe allowe, and wonderfully commend to all men inuocation vpon dead Saintes, which thing commeth very neere to idolatrie.
to holy places, as to Rome, to Treuirs, to Compostella, and such like.
They doe confidently affirme, and hold, that there is a Purgatorie, from whence indulgencies, and pardons may release, deliuer vs.
And who can rehearse the whole rable of those doctrines, which they teach, all which are full fraught both with impietie, and superstition? Who hereafter will not maruell, and wonder at the blindnesse of the Papistes in this so happie an age, in which after most grosse, mistie darkenesse of errours (wherein we went all astray) there is restored by the great bountifulnesse of God a certeine light vnto the world? Indeede all Gods benefites bestowed vpon vs, ought to excite and stirre vs vp to be thank full vnto him: but yet that principall, and singular benefite of God in instauring the doctrine of the Church (than which there could no greater
gifte be giuen to men on earth) say that onely benefite is it, which of all other wee ought chiefly to maruell at, which we ought moste to celebrate, and for which, before all thinges, wee ought to be thank full.
And the greater the blindnesse of the enimies of the Gospell is, so much the more verely doe they owe vnto the immortall God, whose eyes of the mind God hath opened in this age, to acknowledge and behold the trueth, and veritie.
But in this felicitie, and happinesse of our age, great and incredible is the ingratitude of men to God at
this day, which am constrained to confesse not without great sorrowe, and griefe.
Of which argument, and matter haue within these fewe dayes last past compiled a booke, being
happely moued, and stirred vp thervnto by the absurditie, and impietie of a certeine writing, which the enimies of the Gospell published abroade in Printe: which booke of mine (most deare friend) thought good to consecrate, and dedicate vnto you, though it be vnpolished, and written Extempore: and that for these two causes, both for to declare my good will towardes you, and also for your famous godlinesse towardes God, and singular care of Christian religion: which zeale, and feruent affection doe againe, againe pray from my hearte vnto God, that he woulde daily more, and more augment, and encrease in you.
The sonne of God our Lorde, and Redeemer Iesus Christ, keepe and preserue you with all yours, safe and sounde.
The yeare from the comming of the worde into flesh.
and famous Poet Virgil deemeth husbandmen, of all other men, to be thrise happie, fortunate, if they did knowe their good estate: so doe iudge, that all men which are euerie where liuing in this age, to bee farre moste happie and blessed, if at any time they would acknowledge those good blessinges, which God hath sent them, and with thankfull mindes magnifie and praise him for so heauenlie, and celestiall a benefite.
For, if thou doest endeuour to iudge aright, and to weigh, and estimate the matter, as it is worthie, thou
must needes confesse, without all doubting, that within the compasse of these thousande yeares, or more last past, there neuer happened to any age so great a blessing, as to this our age.
For whether thou doest respect, and regard the knowledge of the tongues, the studies of humanitie, and of all good arts, and liberall sciences: or the instauration of holie religion, of Ecclesiasticall doctrine, of true and right Diuinitie: or whether thou considerest the restitution of all thinges (aswell publike, as priuate) to their former estate, or the bringing of them into a better forme, or the amendment of abuses, and of vicious, and corrupt customes, or finally the reformation both of manners, and orders, thou shalt find that all thinges are in better case now, than they were in many ages before.
to be doubted of at all, concerning the skilfulnesse of the tongues, and the studies of good learning, and Philosophie at this day: and because we know well inough,
and too well, that inueterate barbarousnesse, and rudenesse, which before this time ruled and reigned in all the world, will not entreate any longer of these matters.
minde to speake of the reparation of Ecclesiasticall affaires: and in this discourse will bring forth those thinges, which may be good testimonies, and proofes, that those wordes are most true, which am not affraied to affirme, of the felicitie and happinesse of this our age, against many mens opinions, and iudgmentes.
hath bene the state of former times, what superstitions, what faultes, what abuses haue crept into the Church.
Secondly, will declare what hath bene corrected, and amended in doctrine, and what hath bene either chaunged, and turned to better in Ceremonies, or else what hath benequite taken away.
Lastly, will doe the best can, to confute all those obiections, which may, and are commonly woont to be brought against vs in this case: Wherevnto will adde a fewe wordes of the greate ingratitude, and vnthankefulnesse of men to God for his benefites.
After that haue declared these thinges, as the meanesse and simplenesse of my wit will serue mee, if (peraduenture) there be any that will reade this my booke, will speedily dispatch him, and send him away.
Therefore, wil now beginne to declare vnto you, as breefly as can, in what cloudes of darkenesse we haue dwelled heretofore, and will comprehend the summarie of them (for it were both an infinite, and an vnnecessarie labour to prosecute euerie part) generally, as it were in certeine Chapters and cheefe heades.
Now first of all, in the former ages last past, they
which woulde not onely in woorde, but also in deede, both bee, and seeme to bee of the Christian name, were woont to behaue them selues thus, were woont both throughly to persuade them selues, also to proue vnto all other men, that they were good Christians by this meanes.
For will speake onely of those thinges which are well inough knowne, and which no man can denie, but that they are done at this day in the Popes dominions.
Also, that the three persons of the Deitie, or Godhead, namely, the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghost were of the same essence, and (that may vse the woorde, which the Synod, or Nicaene Councell doth vse) Homousios, that is to say, Consubstantiall, equall in power, wisedome, and goodnesse.
And thus farre verely they did beleue aright, and did agree with the Christians of the right faith: but for all this, they had not that opinion of Christ (of whome they were called Christians) which they ought to haue had.
For, although they did beleeue, that Christ was conceiued by the holie Ghost (as the Christian Creede, commonly called Symbolum Apostolorum, doth teach) borne of the virgin Marie, crucified, dead, buried, the third day roase againe from the dead, ascended afterwardes into heauen, and that the same Christ shoulde come to iudge the quicke, and the dead: although (I say) they did openly, without any doubting, professe all these thinges, notwithstanding, they had no
sound vnderstanding at all, or full persuasion of that pointe, which is chiefe and principall, and vpon which onely our saluation hangeth, and dependeth: to wit, that onely Iesus Christ is the author of mans saluation,
and that no woorke, or merite of man, can claime any parte, or parcell of this praise, and glorie: that forgiuenesse
happen onely to those, which put all their hope, and repose all their trust, and affiance in Iesus Christ: and that that pardon of our sinnes, and righteousnesse doeth chaunce vnto vs, neither for any other man, than for Iesus Christ himselfe, as the onely price payed for our sinnes: nor by any other thing, than by faith in the same Christ.
Moreouer, that Iesus Christ is the onely man, which may reconcile vs to God, as being the only Mediatour betwixt God, and man.
Finally, that he onely is our Aduocate with our heauenly father, the throne of grace, our Bishop, and high Priest, to make intercession daily for vs, the propitiation for the sinnes of the world: to be briefe, our righteousnesse, sanctification,
And that all men may confesse that doe here speake the trueth, we will rehearse in order the errours, by which the puritie, and sinceritie of this doctrine, concerning reposing confidence in Christ alone, hath bene maruellously contaminated, and defiled.
First of all therefore it is plaine, and euident that the
daily sacrifice of the Masse was done to this intent and purpose, and in this opinion: that both the quicke, and the dead might obteine thereby pardon of all their sinnes, and wickednesse.
For all men were thus persuaded, that by such a woorke both the wrath of God was pacified, and also such mens sinnes were released, as prouided them to be said, or soung for them, that soules were raunsomed, and redeemed out of Purgatorie fire, and that faultes, and crimes committed, together with the punishmentes due for them, were wholy abolished.
So verely by that meanes that was attributed to mans
woorke, which is due onely to the sonne of God, who offered vp himselfe a sacrifice, and an oblation vpon the altar of the Crosse for the sinnes of the world, whose bodie was betrayed, and deliuered to death for vs, whose
bloud was shedde for the remission of our sinnes: lastly, whose death it selfe was the true sacrifice for the saluation of mankinde.
Furthermore, when as Christ had alone satisfied for the sinnes of all men, these fellowes shewed vs other meanes, and wayes, whereby we might satisfie God more fully, and amply: as, amongest other thinges, Pilgrimages appointed for deuotion sake, in
which verie many consumed, and spent all the time of their life, whilest they ranne a gadding, and madding almost from the vtmost endes of the earth, sometime
to Rome, or Hierusalem, sometime to Treuirs, or Compostella: whilest they goe to see, and visite Saint Michaels Cathedrall Churche and caue in Gargan, and that most royall and magnificent Temple of Saint Lauretan: namely, all to this end, to satisfie, and appease Gods wrath for their sinnes, by this means to obteine saluation.
pardons, either full absolute for euer, or els but for a thousand yeeres, an hundred yeeres, or fourtie yeeres.
which some men (forsooth) at this day call the Communion of Saintes: and this shewe of godlinesse they pretend to cloake that superstition withall, and they labour to paint out a foolishe and feigned thing wittily with such false deceipts, and as it were to adorne and beautifie it with some counterfeit colours.
Monkes, which certeinely were wont to be more esteemed then Christes propitiatorie sacrifice for the sinnes of the world: yea, the greatest part of men, reiecting in the meane while our Sauiour Christ, nothing doubted to redeeme, and purchase with a great summe of monie the communitie of Monasticall workes, as though the
others the superfluitie of good workes, wherewith they themselues abounded, ouerflowed, if there were any that would laie downe redie monie for them, leauing alwayes enough for the obteining of their owne saluation, they were wont to obtrude, set to sale those their workes which were superfluous.
That these thinges are thus truely reported of them, those obligations, or quittances (which are extant at this day) made for that matter are sufficient testimonies, proofes.
Concedimus (inquiunt) praesentium tenore, omnium Missarum, diuinorum officiorum, orationu~, praedicationu~, studiorum, ieiuniorum, abstinentiarum, vigiliarum, laborum, caeterorum{que} bonorum omnium, quae per fratres, sorores ordinis fiunt communionem, participationem.
Statuimus vt iniungantur pro animabus vestris sacra Missarum solennia, vigiliae, ac caetera suffragiorum praesidia: vt multiplici sacrarum orationum, ac piorum suffragiorum adiuti praesidio: hic diuinae gratiae augmentum, in futuro vitae aeternae praemium faciliùs, ac copiosiùs mereamini adipisci.
We doe graunt (say they) by the tenour of these presentes the
communion, and participation of all Masses, of all diuine duties, of all prayers, preachings, studies, fastes, abstinencies, watchings, labours, all other good things, which are done by the Friers Nonnes of this order.
And againe: We ordeine that for your soules there be inioyned the holy rites, solemnities of Masses, vigils, the other helpes of suffrages: that you being holpen with the manifold aide of holy prayers, may deserue to obteine both here in this life the increase of Gods grace and in the life to come more easily, and plentifully the rewarde of eternall life.
Hitherto wee haue recorded, and related faithfully, and truely, the verie woordes of the Monasticall obligation, and caution, least that there should be found some froward fellowe, which might gainesay vs.
other men so to leane and trust to these trifles (which
are of no value to the obteining of saluation) that amongst other thinges they would cause men that lay at the point of death, to remember how many, and how great good woorkes they had done, by whose abundance and greatnesse, the offences which they in their life time had committed, might be ouerwhelmed: how much merites they had, to which Heauen was due.
Now, as concerning the Popes pardons, many men hertofore ascribed so much vnto them, that they would
not sticke to say, that by them a man might obteine forgiuenesse of sinnes, free releasement, from all villanie and wickednesse: yea, although a man had lien with our Ladie, the virgin, Christes mother, (an abhominable
thing to speake of,) and although he had slaine, killed Christ himselfe.
For with such salt was the speach of the Papistes seasoned, and poudered, if at any time they ment to extrude, and set out to sale their pedlarie packe of pardons, as they had commission, and commandement
Some of them also were not afraid to auouche, that the soule, which was tormented in the fire of Purgatorie, did flee vp into heauen at the verie same instant, and moment, in which a peece of monie cast into the boxe for it, did gingle.
To these may be added this their assertion: that the red
crosse with the Popes armes (which heretofore was wont to be erected in the midst of the Churche) had no lesse force, might in it, to abolishe, put away sinne, than the crosse of our Lorde, and Sauiour Iesus Christ.
Moreouer, that if any man had purchased the Popes pardons, he needed not greatly any repentance for his sinnes: onely these (saide they) were without all doubt sufficient to saluation.
Nay, there haue bene men, euen in our dayes, which would say that they had saued more soules by the Popes
What neede many wordes? All of them stoutly, confidently affirmed, that indulgencies, pardons were of power to forgiue most fully aswell the fault, as the punishment: and that the superfluous merites of Saintes, together with these, might be co~municated, imparted to those, which would pay well, and truely for them.
For euery man knoweth this, how that the Popes bull was woont
to be recited, and read to those, which were at the point of death, in which bull there was promised both a full, and absolute abolition of all crimes, and also that the feare of Purgatorie should be wholy taken away.
These thinges verely are such that our posteritie may thinke them to be but forged fables, which wee notwithstanding know very well not to be feigned, but to haue bene done indeed.
sundrie letters, seales, and monumentes of these matters, there will remaine (if they bee kept still, and reserued,) an euerlasting testimonie of Popish impietie, which without all doubt will be propagated, and continued to all posteritie.
and ordeined onely to pick money out of mens purses: at which time what mortall men soeuer went to see, visite the holy places of the citie of Rome, obteined most full pardon, and remission of all their sinnes
and offences, which they in all their life time had committed, which thing is well knowen to all men.
Boniface, the eight Pope of that name, was the first, which ordeined that this Iubile should be solemnized, and celebrated
euerie hundred yeare: Clemens the sixt brought it to fiftie yeares: at the length Xystus the fourth brought it neerer, and cut it shorter, reducing it to fiue and twentie yeares.
the superstitious worshippe, and inuocation of Saintes? For heretofore almost all men did so runne to them for
succour, and reliefe, did so desire, craue of them their aide, and assistance, as though Iesus Christ had not bene at all our Aduocate, and Attournie with our heauenlie father: yea as though the Saintes alone (keeping Christ
streightlie vnder their tuition, setting him to schole) had taken vppon them the patronage, and protection of men on earth.
All men were persuaded, that both by their merites, and intercession, they should finde God fauourable to them, that they should bee absolued, and loosed from the bandes and fetters of their sinnes, that they should bee deliuered daily from imminent perils and daungers: so much was Christ forgotten, and almost quite out of all mens minds.
That may not adde further, that those Saintes were sundrie times called vpon in prayer, of whome it was not well knowne
Nowe, what a follie is it to attribute Diuinitie to mortall men, and to request aide, and helpe at their handes, whome man him selfe hath numbered amongest Saintes? to make of men that are departed this life, Ethnicall and heathenish Gods? to absteine from certeine kindes of
meates, in the honour and seruice of those Saintes? to keepe holie dayes for their sakes, that so thou maist giue them this worship? to runne (like co~mon Coursitours) into wodds, and hilles? to crouch, and prostrate a mans selfe before the grauen pictures, Churches, and Chappelles of dead men? to adore their images, to worship their ashes, bones? also to build with infinite cost and charges Temples vnto them? to distribute, parte vnto euerie peculiar particular Saint his proper vertue, vnto euerie seuerall Saint his seuerall, singular function, office? to hang vp vpon the pillers walles of Churches anathemaes or gifts offrings, oftentimes to light candels at noone day? to burne sweete franckincense, to pay thy foolish vowes? and who can recount
all those thinges, which men doe for the worshippe of Saintes, contrarie to the first commaundement of the Decalogue, which are not onely full of a certeine superstition, but also of execrable impietie, idolatrie: yea, which come verie neere well nigh to a certeine Paganisme.
Such a prayer inuocation is that which is openly soung of S. Peter in their Churches.
gloriose patrone, Nostrae salutis opifex: Tu es nostrum refugium, Tu robur potentissimum, Tu salus, protectio.
That is, glorious Patrone S. Peter, The woorker of our saluation, Thou art our refuge, Thou art our most mightie strength, Thou art our safetie, and protection.
Here verely we may see, that that, which ought to be attributed onely to the sonne of God him selfe, our Sauiour Christ Iesus, is ascribed to a mortall man, and that contrarie to the whole Scripture of the olde and newe Testament, which is giuen by inspiration
Thus you haue hard how the sinceritie of this doctrine (concerning trust, and confidence in Christ) hath bene heretofore contaminated, corrupted with diuers, and sundrie errours.
be truly, also to seeme to be Christians, did (as saide before) prouide that the sacrifice of the Masse might be offered for them, as well to obteine pardon, as to make an attonement for their sinnes: they made long iorneis, and vndertooke great trauels, perigrinations to holie places, they bought deerely the Popes indulgencies,
pardons, and bulles, they laboured to bee chosen, and elected into the societie, and fellowship of Friers, they gotte for them selues both by suite, and siluer the suffrages of Monkes, and the communion of their good woorkes, they fled as suppliantes for succour, and defence to the Sanctuaries of Saintes.
And they verely supposed (such was their blindnesse) that by these thinges they had prouided excellently well for their saluation.
So greatly did they swarue, erre from the true faith, and beliefe in Christe, in that darknesse of ignorance and errours: and tooke what honour they ought to haue giuen onely, and soly to Christ, namely to haue placed all their affiance, and trust of saluation in him alone, that they transferred to foolish thinges, thinges full of impietie, notably reproching, and dishonouring the sonne of God, crucified for vs, whose death they did beleeue, not to bee of sufficient force, and of strength, to satisfie, and to pacifie God for the sinnes of mankinde.
The same men of that time as often as either they entered
the Church, or went out of it, did lightly sprinkle them selues with holie water in the Church porch, (which was commonly readie at hand there, through the care of the Parish Clerke or Sexton) to wipe, wash away by that meanes the daily blottes of their offences,
and spottes of their mindes: which thing also differeth not much from the superstition of the Ethnikes.
For in olde time, amongst the Gentiles, which were wholy giuen to the worshipping of idols, if any were polluted, and defiled with any heinous wickednesse, they were woont to wash them selues (as Virgil saith) Flumine viuo, that is to say, with a fresh running riuer, to
the ende they might bee both present at the sacrifices, and also that they might the more purely call vppon their Gods.
the Sextons of the Heathen, to purge with holy water all those, which entered into the holy Temple: with which thing the Emperour Valentinian being offended, and
greeued, gaue the Minister of the Church a boxe on the eare with his fist, because hee accompted him selfe to be rather defiled, than purified, by such a sprinkling.
vpon the Sunday into the Church, did by and by sticke vp waxe candels in the place, where the consecrated bread was woont to be reserued.
Moreouer, they lighted candels (which thing was thought very necessarie) to the image of S. Erasmus, praying him to giue them riches: to the image of S. George, praying him to saue them in battell: to the image of S. Barbara, praying her that they might not die before they had receiued the Eucharist, then called howseling: to the image of S. Apolline, that they might not be troubled with the tooth ache.
these Saintes pictures, they fixed their eyes firmely and stedfastly vpon them, they spake with them, they kissed them, they requested what they would of them.
Now, how much this thing doeth differ from idolatrie, let other men iudge.
not worship the pictures them selues, but the persons after whose similitude, likenesse those images are either painted, or grauen, and to whose names they were consecrated, it is no good shift.
For the Gentiles, which were giuen to the worshipping of idols, were in the same minde, that they would say, that they did woorshippe,
pray vnto, and reuerence them, the likenesse of whose countenaunces those images did expresse, and represent vnto vs: which thing also Plato (if be not deceiued)
The same men in those dayes attributed no lesse, yea rather
(if wee will confesse the trueth) more authoritie to those feigned, and forged fables of Saintes, which falsly they call the golden Legend, sith that (as one of their owne Popishe flocke testifieth) it was written Ab homine ferrei oris, plumbei cordis, that is to say, of a fellowe that had an yron face, a leaden hearte: also they gaue no lesse credite to the historie of Lombardus, than they did to the most certeine word of God, and to the Scripture
Yea, they esteemed more the authoritie of mans traditions than of Gods
precepts, of the Decretals than of the Gospell, of custome than of veritie.
The same men at those dayes, if perhappes they had
vowed to any Saint one dayes fast, and hunger, or a Pilgrimage for to recouer their health: finally, if they had bound them selues with the promise of any vow whatsoeuer, they tooke greate care to performe it most deuoutly and holily: But that which they had promised
in their Baptisme to renounce the Diuell, and all his pompes (that may vse the wordes of Arnobius) they neuer thought to performe the faith of such a vow, neither did they heere thinke, that they were greatly bound by any religion to pay such a vow, and promise.
The same men at those dayes, that they might obteine
pardon, and remission of their sinnes, vsed to runne to Rome, there to walke those stations in the citie, which other men did vse in visiting (after the manner) certeine Chappels and Oratories: there they obteined with a greate summe of monie the Popes bull, to the end that they both tarying at home, falling downe before the altars, and images of Saintes at set times, and dayes of the yeare, might be made partakers of such
pardons, as well as if they had bene present in the citie of Rome, to haue walked their Romish stations.
they did pacifie, and satisfie God sufficiently for their sinnes, by fastinges, watchinges, lying vpon the ground, and such like trifles, and follies, which breede in mens mindes nothing but superstition: when as truely, when all is done, there can be no other satisfaction, but the onely death of the sonne of God, who (as S. Iohn saith)
is the one onely propitiation, and reconciliation for our sinnes.
did mislike, dissallow euery chastening of the bodie, if any man labour, or goe about by this meanes, that is, by fasting, by abstinence from meates, by sobrietie, by godlie studies, and good exercises, to represse, to tame, and as it were to bridle the violent rage, and fiercenesse of the flesh, which waxeth too lasciuious, and exulteth too immoderately: (for doe deeme that chiefly to be allowed of, and thinke it to be verie necessarie:) but doe reprehend, and finde faulte with the froward, and peruerse opinion of men, which did beleeue that almost onely such thinges were of vertue, and power, to satisfie for sinnes, and which imagined, that the whole seruice of God, and true godlinesse did consist well nigh in these alone: when as in the meane time, in this hardnesse, streightnesse, and austeritie of life, they beeing touched and girded but with a worde, woulde oftentimes rage furiously like madde men, woulde burne in desire of reuengement, woulde stirre vp tumultes, and Tragoedies in a matter of nothing, that may adde nothing more greeuous.
So little true, and sincere pietie towardes God was there in those trifles, which pretended such an honest, and goodlie shewe.
The same men in those dayes, if they had bene daily
present at the sacrifice of the Masse, if they had bene both at morning and euening prayer, chiefly if they had bene sprinkled with holy water vpon holy dayes in the solemne procession of supplicantes, or if they had tasted at all in the Church (as the fashion is) of consecrated hallowed salt, howsoeuer otherwise they did leade their life they iudged now all to be safe, sure: as men, who hauing all the spottes of their wickednesse, and iniquitie put away (if they were polluted, and defiled with any) were now by such an aspersion of water, or tast of salte, beecome pure on euery part, and holy, as the Canon lawe teacheth.
The same men, if peraduenture they had not so duely
obserued those fastes, which were proclamed at set dayes and times of the yeare, did now thinke that they did offend more greeuously, than if they had violated, and broken the commaundements of God him selfe.
On the contrarie side, if they had kept, and obserued these fastes, they were persuaded that they had now deserued, and merited remission of sinnes, that they honoured God with as greate an honour, as might be, that they had giuen to God a godlie worshippe, and an acceptable duetie.
So greate superstition was there in these thinges, which men had instituted, and ordeined.
The same men, if they had iterated and repeated to a certeine number of beades the Lordes prayer, and the
wordes of the Angel, saluting the virgin Marie, yea and that slouthfully, and as it were doing an other thing, onely to fill vp their number, and to make a sounde without sense, they did beleeue that they had now incredibly delighted Gods eares, that they had pacified, and appeased Gods wrath, that they had truely praised God, that they had duely prayed vnto him.
The same men of that time, if they had continued all
their life long to increase their wealth by any meanes
whatsoeuer, to heape vp goods and riches by right or by wrong, to circumuent and defraud their neighbour, to robbe and spoile the poorer sorte by vsurie, if at the length, when they laie on their death bed, they had either taken order for the image of some Saint to be placed in the Church, or by their last will and Testament had geuen cannot tell what little legacie to the poore, they thought that they did depart out of this life pure, and spotlesse, as though nuw by this one thing all their sinnes had bene purged, and cleane put away.
Yea, moreouer, lying now at the point of death, they commanded their executours to see them buried in a Franciscan
Friers weede: being verely persuaded, that the Diuell had no power at all ouer any man, that was lapt, cloathed with that holy garment, so brought to his graue.
The same men in those dayes, hauing buried their wiues, and being nowe widowers, thought that it was
lawful for them to take vnto them a concubine, the Magistrate wincking at so great wickednesse: and in the meane while, howe many yeeres did they for all that liue in so filthie a life, being touched with no godlie sorrowe, and griefe of their minde for their sinnes, neither abandoning, nor casting off their concubine, neuer purposing to liue chaste afterwades? Onely in a certeine feigned, and hypocriticall repentance, and to satisfie the commandement of the Bishop of Rome, they came once a yeere to the Lordes table: but howe worthily, and howe faithfully, the matter it selfe doeth declare: with what fruite, any man may easily coniecture by Saint Paules commination.
yet in the meane time they seemed to themselues to bee verie faire, and good Christians.
Such was the blindnesse of former times, and such examples tooke the
enough finde faulte with the people, whome they did corrupt by their yll example, nor condemne easily in the Laietie, that which any other man might iustly reprehend in them.
exhorte an other to chastitie, the impenitent to repentance, hee that is defiled with all kinde of wickednesse exhorte an other to holinesse? Or what can his authoritie preuaile, who is deprehended, found faultie in the same vices, which he reprehendeth in other men? which him selfe doth indeede accuse his owne faultes, whilest hee chideth other men not so guiltie as he? But let vs returne againe to our purpose.
to carrie, and beare aboute with them in their bagges a seale of waxe (consecrated by the Bishop of Rome) which of the imprinted image, or figure they did tearme Agnus Dei, that is to say, The lambe of God: being verely persuaded, that that same seale had in it a principall power, and a wonderfull vertue (by reason of the blessing of Christes vicar, by which there was diuinely from heauen inspired into those kinde of seales a certeine secret vertue) against all thunderclappes, lighteninges, and tempestes, and can not tell what other euilles.
Such a vertue they attribute to their Easter waxe candels,
and to those which are consecrated vppon the feast day of the Purification of Marie, also both to blessed salt, and blessed holie water, in which thinges they thinke there is a power, and vertue, to driue away euill Spirits, and Diuelles.
Such a like superstition there was amongst the Iewes, and a vaine credulitie of that
name, which they call Tetragrammaton: which being engrauen in gold, they supposed, that whosoeuer carried that about with them should be safe, and sure, by
the vertue, and efficacie thereof, from greate and many mischiefes.
The like superstition also is that, which one Serenus Samonicus writeth of that ridiculous name Abracadabra: that being written after a certeine manner in a paper, and hanged vpon the necke of him that is sicke of an ague, doth by little and little driue away the disease.
The same men of that time iudged those to be good
woorkes, which there is no man at this day but will confesse they were full of superstition, and idolatrie: as for example these, vowed Pilgrimages, gadding into woddes, and hilles, the redeeming of the Popes bulles, the woorshipping of images and pictures, the adoration of images, the bowing of the necke before Churches, perfuming before the altars of Saintes, the burning of franckincense, and waxe candels, the fulfilling of vowes, giftes hanged vpon the pillers of the Church, the adopting of housholde gods, superstitious fastes, choyce and difference of meates, abstinence from milke, cheese, butter, flesh, egges, thred bare apparell, contemning despising of marriage, often watchinges, lyinges vpon the ground, babbling of prayers which they did not vnderstand, voluntarie vexing tormenting
of their bodies, the offering of an hired wages to the Stationaries that scratch scrape for monie, the election into the couent fellowshippe of Friers, building of Monasteries, founding of Masses, ordeining of altars, memories, anniuersaries, the wearing of an image of waxe consecrated by the Bishop of Rome, inuocation to dead men for helpe, the hanging of the Gospell about their necke, the walking of the stations of Rome, supplication to the couerings, and cushinges of Saintes, the sprinkling of holie water, the tasting of consecrated salt, the bearing about of images in publike processions, the worshipping and kissing of vncerteine relikes,
long tedious songes in the Church, the houres of our Ladie, satisfaction for sinnes, the Euening prayer of the virgine, the censing of hearbes and boughes, the profession of a Monasticall life, voluntarie beggerie: and who can rehearse all the rest of that trash?
these woorkes? What witnesse of Gods worde? Where is there any mention at all of these thinges in the writinges of the Prophets, and Apostles? Finally, what either commandement or example is there extant any where in the holie Scriptures for these? Moreouer, what do they auayle to religion? Of what force are they to obteine saluation? What rewardes are promised, and proposed to them? Who either of the auncient Diuines taught these thinges, or who in the first, and Primatiue Church did euer obserue them? Last of all, what necessitie pray you is there of these, either to the amplifying of Gods glorie, or to the profite and commoditie of others? Thus verely it is plaine, and euident how greate a mist of darkenesse there was spred ouer all mens minds in former times, seeing that of those, which had the charge to teach others, such thinges were inculcated into the eares of the people, indeede shadowed after the shape of sanctitie, and holinesse: but, to say the trueth, onely foolish deuises of men.
Such were in old time amongst the Iewes those thinges, which they had
added, and put to the Lawe, which our Sauiour Christ mentioneth so often in the Gospell: as for example, broade philacteries, long fringes of their garments, often washinges of their handes, and of pottes, babbling of prayers, ambitious fastes, and other such like thinges.
How much better had it bene, to haue inculcated, and beaten those thinges onely into their heades, which come neerer to true godlinesse, and wherein mans saluation consisteth? Such we knowe are those good workes
in deede, both verie acceptable to God, and worthie of a Christian man, which both the Table of the ten commandements
doeth teache, and Christ doth command, and the Apostolicall doctrine doth commend vnto vs: as namely, the feare of God, repentance, trust in God, loue towardes him from the whole heart, the confession, and propagation of the Gospell, calling vpon God in trouble and aduersitie, thankesgeuing in prosperitie, cheerefulnesse in miseries and afflictions, perpetuall praise of God, iustice and vpright dealing towardes thy neighbour, diligence and painefulnesse in thy office duetie, sobrietie, temperance, chastitie, and such like.
And those which are next in place to these, to ouercome
anger, to put away hatred, to represse the desire of reuenge, to refuse glorie, to loue our enimies, to blesse them which curse vs, to doe good to them which hate vs, to pray for them which hurt vs, raile vpon vs, and reuile vs, to recompense an iniurie with a benefite, to giue meate to the hungrie, drinke to the thirstie, almes to the needie, to interteine and receiue straungers into thine house, to couer and cloath the naked, to visite the sicke, to admonishe him that is in an errour, to teache and instruct the ignorant, to helpe the perplexed and doubtfull man with thine aduise and counsell, to make enimies, and those that disagree, friendes againe, to comforte the afflicted, and such like.
What other thing doth the Apostle S. Paule teache, but that we should alwayes
endeuour (not trusting to our owne strength, but chiefly to Gods assistance) and labour to liue godly, iustly, innocently, vprightly, holily, chastely, soberly, temperately, profitably to the Church of God, friendly
for the life of men, agreeably to Christianitie, and in summe, to liue worthie the Gospell of Christ? He willeth
vs to walke in newnesse of life, and not to serue sinne any more, to offer vp our bodies a liuely, holy,
and an acceptable sacrifice to God, to crucifie our flesh, with the affections and desires thereof, to keepe our selues immaculate, and vnspotted of the world.
He warneth, and exhorteth vs, that we be renewed in the spirit of our minde, and that we put on the newe man, which
is created to the image, and similitude of God, in righteousnesse, and true holinesse: that we be followers of
God as deare children, that we walke worthie of God, and as becommeth Saintes, supporting one another through loue, endeuouring to keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace, being courteous, and tender hearted one to another.
He biddeth vs to tame alwayes, and to represse our naturall viciousnesse, and our wicked affections, neither to waxe proud, and loftie in prosperitie, nor to be too much deiected and cast downe in aduersitie: whatsoeuer we doe, to doe all to the glorie of God: no man to regard his owne things, but rather
Moreouer, to be such that no man may be offended at any time with vs, but that we prouoke others by our good example vnto godlinesse, and vertue.
pray without ceasing, that in all things we giue thankes to God, that we alwayes sigh after heauenly things, and despise humane, and earthly thinges.
both this same Apostle, and the rest doe deterre, dehort vs from whoorehunting, from obscenitie, and filthinesse of wordes, from hatred, and heartburninges, from spitefull enuie, from vaineglorie, from ambition, from auarice, from pride, from surfeting and gluttonie, and from all other vice, and wickednesse.
things they doe perpetually inculcate that faith, which looke what an one it is within, such an one doeth loue towardes our neighbour shew it forth, represent it to be without.
Thus you haue heard what be the duties of a Christian man, and the workes which are truely good,
acceptable in deede to God, and which God hath ordeined, that we should walke in them, as S. Paule saith
And these verely are those good workes, which both giue euident testimonie of our faith, declare our minde to be gratefull, mindfull of Gods
benefites towardes vs, commend vnto Infidels our Christian profession, which allure, inuite our neighboures to the studie of godlinesse.
If these thinges had bene in former ages diligently, daily inculcated into the eares, mindes of all men, truely there had not so many superstitions, so many vices, abuses crept into the Church, as there did: of which now we will goe on forward to speake and to intreate of the rest, which remaine behind.
But first let vs say somewhat of the Pope, the God vpon earth, as the Papistes doe call him.
which were persuaded throughly, that the Bishop of Rome was by Gods law head of the catholike Church, the high Priest of Christian religion, the vicar of Christ, and successour of S. Peter, (as it were) a certeine God amongst men, partaker of both natures with Christ, and superiour to an vniuersall Synod, or generall Counsell: to whom it was lawfull to broach a newe doctrine, which was contrarie to the doctrine of the Gospell, to make a new article of our faith in the Creede, to prescribe
vnto all men a new forme and manner of liuing: who lastly might commaund, euen the Angels themselues, as his garde attending his becke, and who might at his pleasure thrust out of Heauen whome he would: yea, those that were guiltlesse, and had neuer deserued it.
omitte, and let passe, howe that he commandeth that all the decrees of the Apostolicall seate shoulde
bee receiued, as if they had bene confirmed, and ratified by the diuine voyce of Peter himselfe: that
he will haue vs to beare the yoke put vpon vs by the holy seate, yea though it be scarse tollerable: that he doth suffer him selfe to be reproued, and rebuked of none, though he doeth leade an innumerable sorte of soules to Hell with him: that he doeth take away in the Supper of the Lord, rites instituted by our Sauiour Christ: that he transferreth to his owne constitutions, that glorie, which is due vnto God alone: that he goeth on still to manteine, and defende doctrines of Diuels (for so doeth the Apostle call them) concerning forbidding of
marriage, concerning the vse, and choyce of meates, and finally, concerning such like thinges: that he glorieth that both the swordes are giuen to him, that he challengeth
vnto him selfe the power both of the celestial, terrestriall Empire, according vnto that saying, Data est mihi omnis potestas in coelo, in terra, that is: All
power is giuen vnto mee in Heauen, and in earth: that he affirmeth himselfe to haue the right of translating the Monarchie which Cesar now obteineth: to be brief, that he compelleth religion to serue his profite, that
hee ruleth, and reigneth like a King, that he encreaseth his dominions by warres, that he possesseth, and holdeth straunge cities by force, by fraud, finally by any pretence whatsoeuer: in summe, that he desireth him selfe to bee set both aboue the Scripture, and the Church, and almost aboue God him selfe: that hee maketh a gaine of Ecclesiasticall matters, and of the holy Ghost: that he reacheth foorth his feete for most noble Princes to kisse: that he canonizeth for Saintes dead men, whom he thinketh will be profitable to him: last of all, that he breaketh leagues, that he breaketh the faith, and religion of an oth, that he giueth leaue for men to doe against the commaundementes of GOD, and that he permitteth subiectes to forsake their allegeance, and to cast off
all obedience and loyaltie to their lawfull Prince: and what one man, pray you, can rehearse all his doings, of whiche there is neither end, nor measure? For let passe
pretermit many thinges, which were to be added: of the negligence of the Pope in caring for the Christian common wealth (for he boasteth that he is set ouer it by God as cheefe President, whose charge is to see that it take no harme) in correcting and amending corrupt doctrine, in abolishing wicked worships, in assembling Synodes, calling Councels, in amending the corrupt manners of all states, finally, in gouerning guiding other matters, affaires perteining to his office, function.
thinges, which all the world (almost) crieth out vpon: namely, that the Pope forbiddeth many thinges, which either are no where prohibited by Gods lawe, or plainly permitted by the same: that he requireth his owne lawe to be of more account, than Gods commaundements, that he prouideth euerie where rather for his owne gaine, than either for Gods, glorie, or the saluation of Christian people: that by his indulgencies, pardons he both augme~teth the libertie, impunitie of sinning, also cutteth away all occasions, causes of amendment of life: finally, that he neither careth to see his own canons obserued, nor endeuoreth to represse that infinit vnmeasurable riotte and excesse of the Cardinals of Rome.
Hitherto you haue heard of the Bishop of Rome whome the Papistes account to bee our supreame Bishop, most holie Lorde.
Some salute him with the title appellation of Prince, Father of mankind, othersome vouchsafe to giue him the name, and honour of a terrene, or earthlie God.
Now let vs come to Baptisme, which sith that it was instituted,
ordeined by Christ him selfe for mans sake: namely, that they which are borne by nature the children
of wrath, may through a certeine new regeneration by the Spirit, beecome the sonnes of grace: and that by Baptisme they might be purged fro~ the spottes of sinne, which they brought with the~ into the world, when they were borne: this vse the Papistes in former ages maruellously defiled.
For they were not afraid to baptise sacring belles, other belles with great ceremonies, yea almost
obseruing the same rites, whiche were vsed in baptising infantes.
For neither exorcisme, nor vnction is left out: they haue godfathers, they haue names giuen them, and all the rest of the thinges, which were woont to be vsed in the true Baptisme, are practised very deuoutly, or rather superstitiously, not without greate reproche, mockage, and despite of the true Baptisme: especially, seeing here, as in baptising of childre~, euerie hedg Priest Curate will not serue, but onely the Bishop of the Diocesse, namely to this end, that there may bee more authoritie in the stage play, whilest that such a christening is full of pompe.
And because Baptisme was ordeined of Christ to be the lauer of regeneration, the washing away of our sinnes: the Papistes were woont to consecrate with
superstitious rites (for they had no commaundement of Christ concerning that matter) water with salt, by which either those that entered into the Church (as said before) or those whiche went out thence might sprinkle them selues, to wash away the spottes, and blottes of their daily sinnes, and those light offences and faultes of theirs: which custome nowe also lasteth in places of Poperie.
Now what great abuse was there heretofore of confirmatio~, as they call it? For wheras in it there ought to be had a diligent inquirie of doctrine, a professio~ of faith as a chefe principal thing to be required in bishoping the Papists leauing neglecting these, send the children away, after that they haue signed them in the foreheads
with the holy Chrisme (to vse Petrus Lombardus wordes) geuen them a boxe on the eare.
So if you respect the true vse of confirmation, it hath no place at all amongst the Papistes: and the thing it selfe being quite taken away, there remaineth onely the name, and a certeine shadowe of an old auncient custome.
confession: as for example, that hard, to scrupulous a reckoning vp of all our sinnes, reseruing of certeine cases, that appendix in absolution of the merites of Saintes, Romish indulgencies, humane satisfaction for sinnes, and if there bee any such like.
In the Supper of the Lorde the cheefest abuse was of
Masses, especially that manifold number, and great varietie of them, as for trauellers wayfaring men, for sailers seafaringme~, for women trauelling in childbed: item the Masse of the crowne of thorne, the Masse of the three nailes, the Masse of Christs vncircumcision: what? were they not woont to flee for reliefe vnto Masses, as many as desired, wished to haue a prosperous ioyfull euent to all things, which they enterprised went about, which sought a remedie for their diseases, which would gladly escape, shun all imminent euils daungers? Yea moreouer, Masses were thought to be profitable to deliuer the dead fro~ the fire of Purgatorie.
For the matter was now come to that passe, that that Sacrament which was instituted and ordeined to excite, stirre vp liue men to the remembrance of Christs death, was almost wholy translated to the dead.
superstitious reseruation of the Lordes bread, and the pompe in which the same is carried about, and shewed both in publike processions, and also in solemne vewinges of the field in the Rogation weeke.
doe furthermore omit let passe that taking away of one parte of the Sacrament from the people, flatte contrarie to the
But let vs come to matters of greater weight and importance,
and first and formost to the promises concerning Christ to come: in the former age no man had any rememberance, or certeine knowledge of that promise, which is the first both in time, order.
Such cloudes of ignorance, errour, did so miserably darken the whole world.
And yet there are some also at this day, which thinke that we doe wrest that place of Genesis (in which
is conteined the first promise) to the vauntage and commoditie of our owne cause: when as in deede the most auncient Doctours of the Christian Church make with vs: as Irenaeus, who not once, or twice, but often testifieth,
that the seede of the woman is that, which Marie brought foorth into the world, to wit our Sauiour.
doth Saint Cyprian vnderstand that place, in his second booke against the Iewes: so doth S. Hierome likewise,
which we haue declared in another place: so doeth the Authour of that Epistle, De viro perfecto, whosoeuer he was that wrote it.
wote well, that to this day it hath bene vsed to be read in their Bibles, Ipsa conteret caput tuum: that is to say, She shall bruse and breake the Serpentes head: as though it ought to be vnderstood of the woman, and not of the seede of the woman.
So Prudentius may seeme to haue read, and vnderstoode it,
when he saith: Author ipse doli coluber Plectitur improbus, vt mulier Colla trilinguia calce terat.
And a little after he saith thus: Hoc erat aspidis atque hominis Digladiabile dissidium, Quòd modò cernua foemineis Vipera proteritur pedibus.
But (as saied before) all this is to be referred to the
seede of the woman, which is the childe of Marie: to wit, our Lorde, and Redeemer Iesus Christ, as Irenaeus interpreteth that place.
Yea, and Saint Cyprian readeth it thus, Ipse conteret caput tuum: He, &c. hauing respect rather vnto the sense, than vnto the woorde.
So likewise the Greekes say, [undefined span alphabet]: that is
to say, He shall bruse thy head, that so [undefined span alphabet] being put in the Masculine gender, may be referred to the sonne of the woman, who is Christ: that is to say, respecting rather the meaning of the place, than the bare woorde.
it must be read so out of the Hebrue text, that it respecteth the seede: to whose iudgement as many as at this day are excellent, and skilfull in the knowledge of the tongues doe condescend, and agree.
And that our aduersaries may the lesse doubt of this (as all our sayinges, and doings are suspected of them) Picus Mirandula, a man most famous in the age wherein
promise to Christ, neither doeth he vnderstand it any otherwise, than we doe at this day.
For amongest other things thus he writeth of the death, and punishment of Christ:
Vidit anguis immolatam Corporis sacri hostiam: Vidit, fellis perusti Mox venenum perdidit, Saucius dolore multo
Quid tibi profane serpens Profuit, rebus nouis Plasma primum perculisse Versipelle astutia? Diluit culpam recepto Forma mortalis Deo,
that the sonne of God, taking vnto him the shape, and bodie of a man, whilest he voluntarily offered him selfe to die, did breake the head of that Serpent, which by his craftinesse, and subtile sleightes had deceiued the first parentes of mankinde, and that by the sacrifice of his owne bodie vppon the Crosse, he made an attonement for the fault, and crime, which our first parentes had committed.
But let vs proceede, and goe on forward to the rest.
nothing at all of the Priesthood, or Bishoppricke of Christ, who hath both instructed vs in wholesome doctrine, and satisfied for the sinnes of mankinde by the sacrifice of his owne bodie, whilest he sacrificeth vp him selfe vppon the altar of the Crosse, and who daily and perpetually prayeth vnto God for our safetie, and saluation.
difference betwixt the newe Testament, and the olde, betwixte the Lawe, and the Gospell, betwixte Moses, and Christ, which thing bringeth a great light to the whole Scripture.
Neither did they thinke aright (which a man might woorthily maruell at) of iustification: because they did beleeue that good woorkes did almost onely auayle to the obteining of forgiuenesse of sinnes, to the satisfaction for crimes committed,
to the obteining of righteousnesse, to the deliuerance from death, and hell fire: briefely, to the obteining of eternall blessednesse.
Therefore, they both trusted to their owne merites, and put their confidence in their good woorkes, and good deedes, and satisfied of themselues sufficiently for their sinnes, and thought that heauen was due vnto them for their honest actions.
would sell their idle and superfluous woorkes of supererogation, if there were any that would redeeme them with monie.
So much some men did attribute to their owne merites, and good woorkes.
almost no difference betwixte that righteousnesse of faith, whereof Saint Paule entreateth to the Romanes, and that politicall righteousnesse, which conteineth the ciuil discipline of vertue, manners: which thing the bookes of our aduersaries doe plainely, and openly testifie.
the abrogation of the lawe: neither could they once vnderstande, or suspect, by what meanes wee are deliuered from the execration, and curse of the lawe, by Christ.
Neither knewe they sufficiently that distinction of a feigned, and deade faith, which Saint Iames testifieth
to bee the faith of diuelles: and of the true and liuely faith, which thou maist call (if thou wilt) both the Euangelicall, and the iustifying faith· and which Augustine termeth the faith of Christ, and the faith of Christian grace.
For, as often as they heard faith named, they dreamed that it was either that naked, bare historicall knowledge of things comprehended in the Scriptures, or else the profession of religion: they were vtterly ignorant
of that assured trust of Gods grace, and of remission of
our sinnes, and of the mercie promised for Christs sake, which one onely faith is in deed the true Christian faith, by which we both call vpon God, and boldly approche, and come vnto him: and finally, haue peace with God
woorkes: yea, they reuerenced as much both the rites founde out by men, and also that childish Paedagogie of ceremonies, as they did the woorkes prescribed by Gods lawes, and those woorkes, which are necessarie to saluation.
Neither knewe they in what point the kingdome of Christ differed from the Popishe common weale, or the true Church from the false Church.
Neither knewe they what difference there was betwixt fasting, and choyce of meates.
outward factes, and that ciuil iustice were required they sawe not, that the whole, and most perfect obedience of the heart towardes God was exacted, and required of vs. So by that meanes they stoode in great admiration at the vaine shadowes, and similitudes of good woorkes, they did not beholde the solide, and expresse image, and picture of true righteousnesse.
It remained now, that we should bring foorth more matter concerning the abuse of ceremonies (of which by the way haue saied somewhat before) concerning the impure single life of Priestes, concerning the superstition, hypocrisie, and tyrannie of the mendicant, or begging Friers, to be briefe, of Pharasaisme in the Frieries and Monasteries, of Epicurisme in the Collegies of Canons, of Iudaisme in Ecclesiasticall rites, of Paganisme in the life and manners of the Christians of the former
age, of so many snares of mens consciences, of the feigned miracles of Saintes, almost sixe hundred such like deuises.
But hope that euerie man will by these few, which we haue spoken of, easily coniecture the rest which remaine, which are very many.
For as suppose, haue shewed sufficiently, what hath bene the state of Christianitie now of late yeares, and many ages past, and haue declared what superstitions, what faultes, what abuses haue crept into the Church.
Iesus Christ, that as he hath restored the light of his Gospell to those, which heretofore were compassed with the thicke cloudes of errours, so he woulde open the eyes of the aduersaries of the Gospell, that they may be conuerted from darkenesse to light, from the power of Sathan to God: finally, from the vaine superstition of their auncestours, and forefathers, to the worshippe of true godlinesse, Amen.
The second parte of this Discourse, Wherein is declared what hath bene amended, and corrected by our men in Ecclesiasticall doctrine.
NOW will we come to the second part of this booke: and we will briefly declare what hath bene nowe at length amended, and reformed,
First therefore it is plaine, and euident to all men at this day, that from the beginning of the worlde, till now, there hath alwayes beene one and the same way to obteine saluation by: namely, by the sole, and onely trust and confidence in Christ, whome the godly did beleeue should come as the Sauiour promised to Adam, and to the old fathers, euen from the originall of the worlde: whom we now beleeue to be come alreadie at a determinate time, and to haue brought saluation vnto mankinde.
For our faith also at this day is the very same with the faith of the Patriarchs, Prophetes: and finally, of the whole people of Israel in
times past, because they expected, and wayted for that to come, which we doe beleeue to be alreadie done.
Now, though we conceiue in our mindes, that the holinesse of the Patriarches was exceeding greate (whiche without all doubte was singular, and most notable)
notwithstanding, they were saued by no other meanes, but by faith in the Redeemer of mankinde, then promised to them, now exhibited to vs, who is the sonne of God, our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ.
holy fathers were not as yet Christians in woorde, but in deede they were Christians, by reason of our common
faith and beliefe in Christ, whome they did hope would come, whome wee doe beleeue to be come long agoe.
Therefore all men must looke for saluation from this one, and onely Christ: neither is there among men any other name giuen (as S. Peter saith)
For to this Christ giue all the Prophetes witnesse, that through his name all that
much at the blindnesse of the Christians both in our memorie, and in former ages, which did attribute that to mans merites, which is due vnto Christ alone.
For that can not bee denied, which we haue before declared more at large, to witte, that mortall men did not heretofore trust so much to the goodnesse, clemencie, bountie, mercie, and grace of GOD alone, nor so much to the satisfaction of Christ onely for our sinnes, as they did to the dignitie, and woorthinesse of their owne woorkes.
so many rites, and formes of woorshipping GOD: found out, and ordeined by men, so many will woorshippes, so many fraternities, so manifold varietie of Masses, moreouer Pilgrimages, Pardons, a Monasticall life, voluntarie beatings, and also whippinges of our owne bodie, hungers, watchinges, lyinges vppon the bare ground, and who can rehearse all? Whereto (say I) doe wee beleeue that all these thinges did tend, but to the obteining of forgiuenesse of sinnes, to the satisfaction for offences, to the deliuerance from eternall death: briefly, to the obteining of saluation, and blessednesse? So now men ascribed their saluation not to the sonne of God our Lord, Redeemer Iesus Christ, who by his owne bloudshed satisfied
for the sinnes of the worlde, and pacified the wrath of God: but to the worthinesse of their owne woorkes, and to their owne merites, and vertues.
of the Iewes in olde time were of that minde, that they thought the Leuiticall ceremonies, and the sacrifices of the lawe were auayleable to the remission of their sinnes, the Prophets in the meane time shewing them a farre other vse of the lawe, and warning them of that future sacrifice of the Messias, which the Leuiticall sacrifices did shadowe: so the men of the former age obserued and kept superstitious rites, for that they were thoroughly persuaded, that God by them was reconciled, that he by them was satisfied for our sinnes: our men at this day condemning this so impious a persuasion, and testifying that all men obteine peace with God, and pardon of their sinnes, and that all receiue saluation only by faith in Christ.
For not mans ceremonies, but that seede of the woman, promised to Adam, doeth
breake, and bruse the heade of that olde Serpent, which (as Iohn saith in the Reuelation) is called the Diuell, and
Sathan: that is, the sonne of God, our Lord, and Sauiour Iesus Christ is he alone, which doeth destroy the workes of the Diuell, to witte, sinne, and death.
Not the Leuiticall sacrifices, but that lambe of God, whom Iohn
Baptist pointeth to with his finger, is he that taketh away the sinnes of the world.
Not by our merites, and desertes, but through Christ is remission of sinnes preached
Not mans satisfaction, but the sonne of God him selfe (as S. Iohn testifieth) is the reconciliation for our sinnes.
We haue obteined reconciliation, not by the intercession of Saintes, but by our Lord Iesus Christ, as S. Paule doeth witnesse.
For this is he alone, which may reconcile vs to God, being the onely Mediatour betwixt God, and men, as the same S. Paule saith.
the Popes bulles, but he that beleeueth in the sonne (as our Sauiour saith in the Gospell of S. Iohn) hath eternall life.
by the grace of God freely through the redemption, which is in Christ Iesus, as saith the Apostle.
is saued by his owne good deedes, but by the grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ are wee saued, as saith S. Peter in
suppose that haue declared sufficiently, how that we ought to repose all our hope, and confidence of obteining saluation in the free mercie of God, and reconciliation with vs for Christes sake (who by his owne bloud satisfied God for the sinnes of all,) not in our merites, and good workes: and how that the whole Church hath alwayes from the beginning of the world bene iustified, and saued by this faith.
Now, as God in Paradise did first rebuke, and reproue
our first father Adam for sinne (when as he being circumuented by the craft and subtiltie of the Serpent, had neglected Gods co~mandement,) then afterwardes did raise him vp (being afflicted) with the promise of
the deliuerer to come, as Moses sheweth in Genesis and as Christ in Lukes Gospell teacheth his Apostles first to
detect reproue sinners, afterwards to comfort them by the Gospell, when as he commaundeth them to preach repentance, and remission of sinnes in his name:
wherevpon S. Paule in the Actes saith, that he had preached both to the Iewes, and to the Graecians the repentance towardes God, and the faith towards our Lorde
And Christ in Marke saith, Repent: by and by, putting no wordes betweene, hee saith, And beleeue the Gospell: so wee also at this day doe, and see that it be done in our Churches.
For first we endeuour, and goe aboute to bring men to the acknowledging of their sinne, which thing is brought to passe by preaching the Lawe, and the ten Commaundements.
them seeke for saluation by faith in Christ, which thing is done by teaching the Gospell.
Now, as hee seeketh not after the Physician, who knoweth not him self to be sicke: (for it is truely saide, Initium sanitatis esse morbi sensum, That the beginning of our health is the sense and feeling of our disease:) so he which neither feeleth his owne sinnes, nor the wrath of God against his sinnes, that man hath no greate care, and regarde of his owne saluation.
For (as a certeine Ethnike writer saith) Initium salutis notitia peccati, that is to say, The beginning of saluation is the knowledge of sinne.
Neither doe wee onely reprehend, and condemne (as they did in former times) those manifest sinnes, and grosse wickednesses, as periurie, theft, rapine, sacrilege, whoredome, adulterie, incest, manslaughter, witchcraft, and such like: but also, yea and much rather, wee labour to vnfold, and to set before the eyes of our mind, that inward vncleannesse
acknowledged of fewe, and that impuritie of the hearte defiled with manifold affections of all sortes, that prauitie, and wickednesse of the minde, and that pronenesse to sinne, sticking fast in the verie bowelles, entrailes of vs, that inbred vitiousnesse, from whence, as from a stocke, and roote, all sinne and wickednesse whatsoeuer doth budde, and spring.
that onely, but also wee declare, that euen our verie good deedes (if there be any) are not pure, sound, and sincere: but that they are alwayes polluted with a certeine mixture of vice: that they are not true, and solide, but as it were shadowed and coloured: that finally, they are not perfect, or absolute in euerie point, but vnperfect, and scarse begonne: and we doe make it plaine, how farre off we are from the excellencie of that righteousnesse, which God requireth of vs, of which our righteousnesse may seeme to bee scarse a certeine image, or a printe lightly stamped, that may not say
a picture, or shadowe of it: and so at the length, wee sette before sinners both the wrath and iudgement of God, and the torments of Hell, wee terrifie the guiltie, wee accuse them, wee conuince them, we condemne them: now they being thus brought almost to desperation, and in an inward trembling for the conscience of their sinnes, fearing seriously that punishment, which they haue deserued, and being amazed, beaten downe with the feare of hell fire (which thing to doe is the chiefe office of the Lawe) by by we comforte
them with a godlie consolation: and in these distresses, and anguishes of minde, in this feeling of the wrath of God, in this tast (as it were) of eternall torments, wee bidde those men, which are so terrified, and which haue bewayled their sinnes, to flee, as humble suppliantes, vnto the exceeding greate mercie of God, through Christ, to aske pardon for their offences, to pray that GOD woulde forgiue them: that thing is done by preaching the Gospell.
truely maruellous harde, though verie necessarie, (which thing in former ages hath bene neglected) so to lay open, those hidden and inwarde sinnes, so to disclose that wickednesse of mans minde and stubbornnesse of mans hearte, which Hypocrites doe not see at all, being couered as it were with certeine vailes of pride, and selfe loue, so to bring to light that malice, throughly fastened in our corrupt nature, that the sinner, acknowledging his disease, may bee carefull to seeke for a remedie, may labour to flee vnto Christ in feruent desire to reconcile Gods will, and may beleeue that this Christ onely hath by his death satisfied for the sinnes of all men.
Neither doe make so many woordes of this matter rashly, and vnaduisedly
For hitherto there haue bene fewe in the Popes kingdome which could either vnderstand
Which thing the matter it selfe doth plainly shewe to be true.
For as they accompted those heinous, and manifest offences, which the lawes did publikely punish, to be sinnes: so they made nothing of that homebred vitiositie, and of that natiue spot, and corruption of ours: neither did they acknowlege their owne deceitfull dealinges, and (to vse S. Paules woordes) the counsels of
their owne heartes, by searching diligently all the inmost turninges, secreat corners of their owne minde: neither did they see sufficiently their owne vaine hypocrisie, or their vices, which deceiued them with a certeine shewe of a feigned vertue.
which woulde soone neglect the commaundements of God, did carefully keepe, and obserue the prescripts of men: and they which were not greatly greeued with the neglect of them, sorrowed sundrie times verie much for the violation, and breach of these.
For what an heinous offence was it accompted, yea almost a matter of
life and death, if a man in the Lent (as they call it) had bene so bold, as to eate egges, and flesh? On the contrarie parte, what a light trifle, and what a small sinne was enuie, debate, hatred, spitefulnesse, auarice, riot, dronkennesse, whoredome, and such like thought to
bee? Which thing thou maist easily coniecture by this, for that these were streight way remitted to him that confessed his faulte by any sacrificing Priest, and for that there were verie light punishments appointed for them: but the other were not forgiuen but by the Bishoppes, or by those onely, which bare the greatest sway in the Church.
So, that which was committed against the Lawe of God, was easily pardoned: but that which was done against the prescripts of men was verie
So the neglect of singing vpon an holie day in the Church,
what a sinne was it reckoned? But forgetfulnes of God in prosperitie, ingratitude towards God, other such like sinnes, how were they nothing accompted of? could bring forth well nigh sixe hundred such, but that thinke that this, which haue rehearsed, is inough for example sake.
Notwithstanding, will yet relate one or two more, that thereby the whole matter may the better appeare.
day omitted his houres of prayer, how great a sinne was that thought to bee, how scarse pardonable? That the same man did keepe a concubine, that the same man did wholy abandon him selfe to bankettes, to wine, to lecherie, in that there was no man, which was greatly offended.
So, if a Monke had not orderly inough finished his
ceremonies, good God what trembling quaking was there? what anguish of minde? finally, what feare, lest hee should fall into hell? But for the same man to beare priuie grudges against his brethren, for to detract from other mens fame, and good name, that was accompted
If any man vpon an holy day had done any woorke in the fielde, the businesse requisite to bee done, what an heinous offence? what an inexpiable crime was it iudged? But hee that, neglecting the Sermon, had spent the same day wholy in feastes, riottous and reueling bankets, in wine, in surfeting, in dansing, in dicing, in pastimes, and sometime in bralles, and fightinges, he verely was thought to haue made a faire dayes woorke, and to haue kept holy day verie well, and deuoutly.
man Minister, though hee were a godly, and a learned man, he accompted it a wicked act, because it is against the canons, and rules of their order, though it be permitted by Gods lawes.
But the same man is nothing at all affraid, to choose into the number of Bishops,
and Prelates, much more into the number of Parish Priestes, doe not say now dronkardes, couetous caytifes, and angrie wretches, but besides their extreme ignorance, incestuous persons, homicides, parricides, Church robbers, dicers, sorcerers, that may adde no woorse, although the holie Ghoste by the mouth of
So greatly doe they swallowe vp a Camel, which straine at a gnatte.
So verely the Iewes thought it a cursed and damnable
deed, to pull an Oxe out of a dich vpon the Sabboth day: but that Christ by speaking the woorde did heale men vpon that day, that verely they obiected vnto him as the greatest crime that coulde bee.
And they that made a religion of it, to enter the Iudgement hall, namely, to the end they might
eate the Passeouer pure, and cleane, without spotte, the same men were nothing affraide to crucifie an innocent, and guiltlesse man, to witte, our Sauiour Christ Iesus.
his sinnes, being moued thereto by repentance, hath sorrowed greatly in mind for them, hath trembled at the anger, iudgment of God against them, sighing from the bottome of his hearte, hath aspired, desired the grace of Christ, wee will him to hope well, and to be of good cheere: we comfort him being sad, sorrowfull, by proposing, setting before him the clemencie, greate goodnesse of God, who is woont easily to graunt pardon to the penitent, to haue respect to the contrite in spirit, and to him that trembleth at his sayinges.
We teach declare, that the saluation of all men, whosoeuer repent truely, from their heart,
dependeth on the only mercie of God through Christ: that Christ hath satisfied GOD by his death for
the sinnes of all men, and that hee by his punishment hath suffered that punishment, which wee did owe to the iustice of God: that Christ came into the
worlde to saue sinners: that Christ gaue him selfe the price of redemption for all: that Christ was wounded for our iniquities, and broken for our wickednesse: that by Christ we were reconciled, when wee were Gods enimies: that by Christ wee are deliuered from the wrath of GOD: that by Christes bloude we are all cleansed from our sinnes: that Christ doth daily make intercession for vs at the right hande of God his father: that by Christ wee are both sanctified, and are the sonnes of God, and haue life euerlasting.
Hitherto tendeth that which our Sauiour saith in Iohn: So GOD loued
the worlde (saith hee) that hee gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shoulde not perish, but haue euerlasting life.
For GOD sent not his sonne into the worlde, that he shoulde condemne the worlde, but that the worlde through him might bee saued.
Hitherto also perteineth that of S. Iohn: Herein the loue of GOD
appeared towardes vs, because GOD sent his onely begotten sonne into this worlde, that wee might liue through him.
Herein is that loue manifest, not that wee loued GOD, but that hee loued vs, and sent his sonne to bee a reconciliation for our sinnes.
Hitherto also belongeth that, which S. Paule writeth to the Ephesians, and to the Colossians: By whome
(saith hee) wee haue redemption through his bloude, euen the forgiuenesse of sinnes, according to the riches of his grace.
And to the Corinthians: For also our Passeouer (saith hee) is offered vp for vs, euen Christ,
And againe: For he which was without sinne, made hee sinne (that is the price of sinne) for vs, that wee might
will not stande any longer in these testimonies of Scripture.
For the summe of all is this, That GOD, through
Christ, is reconciled vnto vs, and that Christ hath satisfied the iustice of God for the sinnes of mankinde.
For the Gospell, setting downe the reconciliation of God through Christ, and the satisfaction of Christ for the sinnes of men, doth shew forth hope of saluation, and an assured confidence to them that repent.
After this sorte, which you haue hearde, doe wee comforte him, which is greeued for his offences, and sorrowfull for his sinnes.
For wee speake not a woorde to him of Romish indulgencies, of Pilgrimages, of Monkes suffragies, and other such like trifles.
We doe againe, and againe inculcate, and beate into his braine, which is repentant for his sinnes, Christ onely,
We declare that it is Christ alone, whome wee ought to vse as our Spoakesman, Attourneie, and Sollicitour, in appeasing God: that Christ is hee alone, who both by the sacrifice of his bodie hath satisfied for the sinnes of mankind, and in whose onely bloud and merites, all mortall men ought to repose the whole trust of their saluation.
And that there may not remaine any little scruple in
the conscience of the sinner, wee exhorte him to repaire to the Minister of the Church, confessing with an humble, and lowlie mind his sinnes, to desire of him sincerely, and from his heart with grones, weeping, sobbing, teares, and with sighes, absolution, (as our men tearme
We shewe what keyes of the kingdome of heauen Christ hath left
vnto his Churche, that the Churche hath committed those to the Ministers of Gods worde: that it so commeth to passe that Christ himselfe by the Minister of the Church doeth restore man to Gods mercie and fauour, by the Minister doeth comfort with the word of God the afflicted conscience, doeth raise it being fallen and cast downe, doeth strengthen it staggering: finally, by the Minister doeth now after absolution send him away with a pacified, and quiet minde.
For hitherto tendeth that which our Sauiour Christ saith in S. Iohns Gospell:
For, we must not thinke that absolution is any other thing, but
the voyce of the Gospell, sounding by the Minister of the Church, by which that forgiuenesse of sinnes, promised in the Gospell to the penitent, is particularly applied to euerie seuerall man.
Therefore wee ought to heare the voyce of the Minister absoluing vs, and to rest with our whole mindes contented with it, no lesse than to hearken either to the voyce of Christ present, who is truely our Bishop, and high Priest (as the authour of the Epistle to the Hebrues saith) or to the voyce of God himselfe speaking from heauen.
Markes Gospell commaundeth vs not onely to repent, but also to beleeue the Gospell, that is, the preaching of remission of sinnes.
pardon of sinnes may be increased with a certeine heape as it were, and that in this weakenesse of our mindes, pronenesse to distrust, it may be by all meanes on euerie side bolstered vp, vnderpropped and strengthened, we will the partie to be present at the Lordes Supper, and to eate (so as Christ instituted, and ordeined it) the bodie of Christ, which was a sacrifice on the altar of the Crosse for the sinnes of men: and to drinke his bloud, which was shead for the purgation, and satisfaction of sinn
For as faith is first conceiued by the worde of the
Gospell, concerning the promise of grace, remission of sinnes, so the same is stirred vp, erected, and confirmed by the Sacrament: as Saint Augustine testifieth verie well: Sacramentum est quasi verbum visibile, Sacrament
is as it were a visible worde: because that as
faith is conceiued, and bredde in vs, by the hearing of the worde, so the same faith is confirmed and ratified by this externall, and visible signe.
appeareth, how great the loue of the eternall father towardes vs is, which doeth not onely by his worde raise vp those that are afflicted, and lie downe, but also hath added to his worde certeine externall signes, and visible tokens of grace, which may stirre vs vp to the remembrance of the promise concerning pardon of sinnes, and which might teache vs, and put vs in minde of the fauourable, and friendlie good will of God towardes vs.
Now, after that the penitent is mindfull of the Lords
death, which death was a satisfaction for the sinnes of the whole worlde, we bidde him both to giue thankes from his heart to Iesus Christ for his exceeding great benefites towardes vs, for that hee offering vp himselfe for vs, hath appeased Gods displeasure, and for that he hath suffered the punishmentes in his owne bloud, which wee by the iustice of God shoulde haue felte (of which thing this mysticall Supper is extant in the Churche as a perpetuall signe, and monument:) and also wee will him to sing merily and ioyfully hymnes, or songs of praise, vnto the same Iesus Christ, with a gratefull minde, both with himselfe at home priuately, and also in the Churche with the assemblie of the faithfull publikely, and to giue him that worshippe and honour, which worthily he oweth vnto him: finally, to liue godly, and holily, and in a certeine
endeuour, and labour, to change as it were, and to
vndoe that, which hath bene done (which is a sure token of a minde truly repentant) to amend his vices with vertues, to put away after a sort by doing well the memorie of his naughtie deedes before God, as it were to blot them out: to be briefe, to walke worthie of the Lord, as the Apostle saith.
faith in Christ, after a true, and earnest repentance for their sinnes, which now verely bringeth with it another kinde of life, which requireth other manners, the obedience of Gods law is then necessarie, to the end they
may now glorifie God with honest actions, and godlie workes, that they may adorne the doctrine of the Gospell, and that they may offer vp spirituall sacrifices acceptable to God, through Iesus Christ.
For that is not the onely office, and proper function of the lawe (which
thing we haue spoken of elsewhere,) to bring men to the acknowledging of their sinne, and to the feeling of the wrath of God, to shewe vnto the regenerate their wicked affections: but also, that it should bee vnto the iustified by faith as it were a certeine glasse, wherein they
may daily view, and beholde themselues, and by which they may knowe, how farre now they haue proceeded, and profited in godlines, how farre they are off from that perfect righteousnesse: and that it should be vnto them as a certeine candle, shining in the darknes of this life, and as it were a guide to tell them the nexte way to saluation, in which way they ought to finishe the course of this life, and to trauell streight to God: least they at any time offend in any thing, or least they straying from the godlie way of liuing, fall, and rush headlong into sinne: that so at the length, they perseuering constantly in the true worshippe of God, may come to blessed immortalitie, and may finally obteine the rewardes prepared in heauen for them.
And surely wicked actions doe not well agree with a
true faith: neither can they which liue wickedly, filthily, and which endeuour not as much as in them lieth to keepe the commaundements of God, promise vnto themselues that God will be fauourable vnto them for Christes sake.
For hitherto perteineth that notable saying of S. Augustine: Fides tua (inquit) iustitia tua: quia vtique sicredis, caues: si autem caues, conaris: conatum tuum nouit Deus, volu~tatem tuam inspicit, luctam cum carne considerat, hortatur vt pugnes, adiuuat vt vincas, certantem spectat, deficientem sublenat, vincentem coronat: that is: Thy faith (saith he) is thy righteousnesse
for verely if thou doest beleeue, thou doest beware: if thou doest take heede, thou doest endeuour the best thou canst, and God knoweth thine endeuour, and he beholdeth thy will, and he considereth thy combat and fight with thy flesh, and he encourageth thee to battell, and helpeth thee to vanquish, and veweth thee striuing, and succoureth thee fainting, and crowneth thee being conquerour, and victour.
of the godly, that is, of those which are iustified by faith, hauing their sinnes forgiuen them for Christes sake, doe now please God, whereas they haue as yet many faultes in them, and are farre from perfection, so that in respect of vs, there is no reward due to them: notwithstanding,
because that which is lacking in them, Christ doth adde and bring of his owne, therefore God doth bountifully giue, and pay that reward, which he promised to euerie mans woorke, and that for Christes sake, and of his free liberalitie, not as the woorkes themselues doe merite, and deserue of themselues, which verely as yet are many wayes faultie, and maruellously polluted: neither as they come from vs, sith that through our faulte they are alwayes (as said before) farre from perfection: but
in respect that they spring from faith in Christ, and are wrought in vs by the holie Ghoste, who is woont to stirre vp in the heartes of the faithfull new affectes and motions, such as are agreeable with the Lawe of God.
For honest actions are flatly Gods gift in vs: whatsoeuer
thing is in them right and good, co~meth wholy from God, and must be claimed, and challenged as due to the goodnesse of God onely.
very truly (whiche saying is growen to a common Prouerb,) Quum Deus remunerat merita nostra, iam ipse coronat dona sua, that is, When God doeth rewarde our merits, then doeth he crowne his owne giftes in vs. So also saith Fulgentius: Quum Deus vitam aeternam donat, opus suum quod inchoauit iustificans impium, perficit glorificans iustum, that is to say: When God giueth vs life euerlasting, that woorke which he hath begonne iustifying the vngodlie, he hath perfected glorifying the iust.
Therefore the woorkes, and good deedes of the godlie haue their rewards in heauen, not those verely which of them selues, and of their owne nature they deserue: for alwayes there are in them some blottes and blemishes: but they haue those rewardes through the grace, mercie, and goodnesse of God that promiseth them, through the merite of Iesus Christ our Mediatour, and Aduocate.
woorkes, thou hast them set foorth in Esaie, who saith, that all our righteousnesse in the sight of God is as the filthie clout, or menstruous cloth of a woman.
Yea and S. Austine affirmeth our righteousnesse to be so great in this life, that it consisteth rather in remission of sinnes,
of woorkes, albeit it bee defiled, hath his reward in heauen: neither hath the lawe it selfe power to condemne
the godlie, and the faithfull, although (as said) they haue not satisfied the Lawe of God so perfectly, and fully, neither haue kept his commaundementes in euery parte, absolutely.
For hitherto belongeth that which S. Paul saith of the abrogation of the Lawe: Christ (saith he) hath redeemed vs from the execration or curse of
the lawe, hee him selfe being made a curse for vs.
And that which the same Paule hath to the Romans: Nowe
(saith hee) there is no condemnation to them which are engraffed in Christ Iesus, which walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Therefore God for his sonnes sake, (as saide before) doeth accept, and take well in woorth our endeuour, and new begonne obedience: by whose
merite whatsoeuer is wanting to the perfection of our woorkes, is forgiuen vs, that acknowledge, and confesse our owne imbecillitie and naughtinesse: and so at the length wee, which in very deede should neuer, yet now surely by diligence doe satisfie God for Christes sake: so that S. Austine hath saide very well: Omnia Dei mandata tunc implentur, quando quicquid not fit, ignoscitur, that is,
Then are all Gods commaundementes fulfilled by vs, when as whatsoeuer is left vndone, is pardoned vs.
The same S. Austine, speaking of all the Saintes of all ages, when as he denieth that they were endewed with perfect vertue, notwithstanding he confirmeth, that whatsoeuer sinne hath by humane infirmitie crept into their liues to bee streightway put away by the godlinesse of faith And a little after: This (sayth hee) is the one, and
onely hope of all the godlie, groning vnder the bur+den of this corruptible flesh, and in the infirmitie of this life, that we haue with the father Iesus Christ, to be our Aduocate, and Mediatour: and the rest whiche followe in Iohn.
Hee doeth verely intimate thus much vnto vs, that Christ doeth fill vp that which lacketh in vs: that is, that whatsoeuer is wan+ting
infirmitie, is pardoned for Christes sake, and that with this onely hope, and consolation, the godlie doe susteine them selues.
true conuersion, and turning to GOD, there hath neede of a certeine newe obedience towardes Gods Lawe, and a desire to woorke well, as shewed before: neither is it conuenient, or comelie for the penitent person, now to serue sinne any more, nor to giue ouer his members weapons of vnrighteousnesse: but (as the Apostle saith) to walke in newnesse of life,
to put off the old man with his deedes, to put on the Lorde Iesus Christ, to cast away the woorkes of darkenesse, not to suffer sinne to reigne in him, to mortifie by the spirit the deedes of the fleshe, to crucifie the flesh with the affections, and desires thereof, denying vngodlinesse, and wordly lustes, to liue soberly,
iustly, and godly in this present worlde, to bring foorth plentifull fruites of righteousnesse to the glorie and praise of God, to care for heauenly thinges, not to regarde terrestriall thinges, to bee mindefull of hospitalitie, not to forget liberalitie towardes the poore, to bee courteous, modest, and meeke, to forgiue others easily after the example of Christ, to pray without
intermission, to giue thankes for all thinges: breefly, to leade a life woorthie of the Gospell, and other thinges, which S. Paule doeth euery where in his Epistles inculcate.
One suffer with an other, loue as brethren, be pitifull, bee affable, not rendering euill for euill, neither rebuke for rebuke, but contrariewise blesse.
And againe: Bee sober (saith hee) and watching in prayer,
Also: Bee ye harborous one to an other, without grudging: let euery man, as hee hath receiued the gift, so
minister the same one to another, as good disposers of the manifold grace of God.
Also: Humble your selfs vnder the mightie hande of God, that he may exalte you in due time, Cast all your care on him: for he careth
Bee sober, and watch: for your aduersarie the Diuell as a roaring Lion walketh about, seeking whome he may deuoure.
Hitherto also perteinerh that saying of S. Iohn: Loue not this worlde, neither the thinges that are in the worlde.
And: God (saith he) hath sent his sonne to bee the propitiation for our sinnes, Beloued, if God
so loued vs, we ought also to loue one an other.
And: If any man say, loue God, and hate his brother, hee is a lier.
religion, and vndefiled before God, euen the Father, is this, to visit the fatherlesse, and widowes, in their affliction, and to keepe him self vnspotted of the world.
Submitte your selues to God: resist the Diuell, and he will flee from you.
Cast downe your selues before the Lorde, and he will lift you vp. Speake not euill one of an other, brethren.
Finally, hitherto tendeth that saying of our Sauiour Christ in the Gospell by Saint
Matthaewe: Let your light so shine before men (saith he) that they may see your good woorkes, and glorifie your father, whiche is in Heauen.
And againe: Resist not euill, but whosoeuer shall smite thee on the right cheeke, turne to him the other also.
Giue to him that asketh, and from him that would borrowe of thee, turne not away.
And: Loue your enimies, blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, pray for them which hurte you, and persecute
you, that you may be the children of your father that is in heauen: who both maketh his sunne
to arise on the euill, the good, and also sendeth raine vpon the iust, and vniust.
And: Looke whatsoeuer yee would that other men should do to you, so doe you likewise
Hitherto also perteine Christes woordes of feeding the hungrie, of refreshing the thirstie with drinke, of enterteining straungers, of couering the naked, of visiting the sicke persons, prisoners, other such like deedes.
Nowe to the ende that he, whome we haue taken in
hande to teach and instruct, may liue godly and holily, and may resist, and withstand first that naughtinesse, and pronenesse to sinne, throughly settled and fixed in our corrupt nature: secondly, the worlde, offering vnto vs daily innumerable occasions, and causes to all vices: lastly the Diuell, who maketh deadlie warre vpon vs, and who intermitteth not the least point of time, wherein he doeth not either assaulte vs with open force, or with priuie vndermining, wee doe exhort him, being priuie to mans infirmitie and weakenesse, to craue daily in godly prayers Gods assistance, and helpe in the matter, setting aside all confidence, and trust of his owne strength.
For all mortall mens endeuours, and labours, without the grace of God is vaine, voyde, to no purpose.
For as S. Cyprian saith: Dei est omne quod possumus,
Therfore we bid him pray the eternall father of our Lorde, Sauiour Iesus Christ, with all confidence, to bestowe vpon him the
holy Spirit, and that he would vouchsafe to powre the same his holy Spirit vppon him plentifully, and abundantly, and (as the Apostle saith) richely, who may nowe by his wholsome inspiration stirre vp in his hearte new motions, and such as are consonant to Gods will,
who may excite him, inflame him to the loue of God, and to charitie towardes men, who may compell, and vnto true, and constant trust towardes God, to inuocation, vnto thankesgiuing, vnto perpetuall praising of God, vnto the confession, and propagation of the Gospell: finally, to all the dueties of godlinesse, vnto patience in afflictions, and calamities, vnto modestie in prosperitie, vnto iust and vpright dealing towards our neighbour, vnto diligence in our duetie and office, vnto temperance of life, vnto sobrietie, vnto chastitie, vnto courteous and milde manners, vnto the studie of peace and concord: breefly, to all vertues beseeming a Christian man, to liue godly, holily, innocently, friendly to the life of men, profitably to the Church of God.
For the holie Ghost is giuen of God (so as Christ hath promised) but to those onely, which pray vnto him for it.
of God, vnlesse he bee assisted with the helpe of the holy Spirit.
For he it is, whiche illuminateth the minde of man, whiche inflameth his will, whiche reneweth the whole hearte, which stirreth it vp, whiche moueth it to the obseruation of Gods lawe, and to doe those thinges alwayes, whiche are gratefull, and acceptable to God.
By the secret instinct of this holy Spirit, wee goe about those thinges, which are right, honest, and good, and at the length by the present helpe of the same Spirit, wee finish, and perfect those things, which wee haue well begonne.
that is carefull of his owne saluation to beware of this, that he doe not resist the holie Spirit, by obeying his wicked Iustes against his conscience, or that hee expell not, or (to vse the Apostles woorde) greeue not the holie Spirit.
And because the holie Spirit doeth not helpe, and aide sluggardes, nor those that pamper their
owne nicenesse, or that loose and slacken the bridle to
their lustes, nor those that rush headlong into voluntarie destruction: but those verely, or rather those onely, whiche labour to tame by all meanes, and to represse their inbred naughtinesse, and their wicked affections: and who take great heede, and are maruellous warie, that they haue not receiued the grace of God in vaine: therefore wee exhorte him continually, to represse, and keepe vnder the flesh, to eschewe surfeting, to liue continently, soberly, chastely: and wee warne him not once, or twice, but very often, by fasting to prepare him selfe to prayer, nowe and then: (for as saint Cyprian saith: Largioribus epulis mens grauata, minus ad preces crationis euigilat, Othat
is, The minde, whiche is ouer charged with large cheere, is the lesse diligent, and watchfull to pray:) and that euer amongst so many deceiptes, sleightes, and assaultes
of the Diuell, the worlde, and the flesh, he would in feruent prayer request the aide, and assistance of God, neither that hee would be fainte, and wearie in praying.
And we shew him, that he ought to be moued, and stirred vp to prayer not onely with priuate miseries, and afflictions, but also with publike calamities, and common miseries.
Therefore we will him to pray, and to make requests daily vnto God for the Church, and Christian Common weale, and wee bid him pray vnto him for the increase of true Religion, for the fall, and destruction of superstition, for the concorde, and amitie of Princes, also for the peace of the Common
weale, and for publike tranquillitie, wee teache him that vnto prayer hee ought to ioyne both fasting, and almes, bountie, and liberalitie towardes the poore, and all kind of dueties towardes his neighbours, whiche thinges verelie are a certeine signe,
and token of a minde, which gladly desireth to please God, and to approue himselfe to God onely, which ought to be the summe of all our prayers.
And we tell him, that so it will come to passe, that God will sooner heare the prayers of the supplicant, according to that of Esai: Breake thy bread vnto the hungrie, and bring
the needie, and the straunger into thine house: when thou seest the naked, see that thou couer him, and despise not thine owne flesh.
Then thou shalt call vppon him, and the Lorde shall heare thee: thou shalt crie, and he
Yea, and the Angel in Tobie saieth: Prayer is good with fasting, and almes deedes.
Hitherto perteineth the example of Cornelius the Centurion, who (as S. Luke writeth in the Actes of the Apostles)
was woont to giue much almes to the people, and to pray vnto God continually.
Therefore he heard of the Angel: Thy prayer is heard, and thine almes are come vp into remembrance before God.
But if this our penitent person offend in any thing,
and fall againe into sinne (as we are all of vs prone to vice, and the Diuell doth alwayes set before vs some prouocations, and allurementes to sinne) we doe with all diligence exhort him by and by to acknowledge his errour, and humblie to aske forgiuenesse of his most mercifull father, not to suffer sinne to reigne and rule in him, nor to goe on in heaping one sinne vpon another: finally, we exhort him to salue, by Gods helpe and assistance, the fault committed, with greater good deedes, and becomming an honest man againe, to amend and refourme his life.
Also we bid him to remember (as S. Iohn saith in the Reuelation) from whence he is fallen,
and to repent, and to doe woorkes worthie of a man that is repentant: finally, to endeuour (in a certeine studie, and desire to reconcile Gods will vnto him) to doe those thinges which are well pleasing, and acceptable to
God: last of all, acknowledging mans imbecillitie, and procliuitie to offend, and chiefly that inward stubbornnesse, and contumacie of the heart against the lawe of God: moreouer, setting before his eyes those thinges, wherein he hath often offended either of ignorance, or negligence, we bid him perseuere in a continuall repentance: yea, and to cast himselfe downe perpetually, as it were at the feete of Iesu, with the sinnefull woman in the
Gospell, not doubting but that grace doth abound aboue sinne as the Apostle saieth: We bid him, being now
wholy displeased with himselfe, to request the mercie of God with an humble voyce, and knocking of his breast with the Publicane in the Gospell: Finally, to purge continually
the old leuen, and to mortifie (that may vse Paules worde) by the Spirit the reliques of sinne, which as yet sticke fast in his fleshe, and to chasten his bodie,
and to bring it into bondage, and to tame, and represse his vicious nature, both with daily prayer, and with daily
repentance, and with the acknowledging of Gods anger against sinne, and with patience in miseries, and
tribulations, and with the memorie and remembrance of the last iudgement, but chiefly with a certeine Christian courage of the minde, and with the inuincible strength of faith, and of the Euangelicall spirit.
Whatsoeuer there are in the Propheticall, and Apostolicall writinges, either testimonies of Gods wrath against sinne, or examples of punishmentes against the wicked, wee doe excite, and stirre vp this our penitent person, to the remembrance of them: we shew him both that God did not spare the Angels which had sinned, and also that by a deluge or generall floud of
waters he extinguished almost all mankinde for impietie, and vngodlinesse, and that he ouerthrewe quite from the foundation the cities of the Sodomites, and
made them an ensample vnto them that afterwardes should liue vngodly, as Saint Peter saith in his second Epistle.
wherewith God plagued Pharao, and the Aegyptians: but also the great calamities of the people of Israel, and their often captiuities vnder barbarous nations: neither doe we omitted either the destruction of the citie of Hierusalem, or other innumerable such like desolations.
from him those punishmentes, which God hath taken oftentimes vppon seuerall persons for their sinnes, as vppon his dearest darling Dauid, vppon Osias, vpon
Manasses: and all this wee doe to this ende, and purpose, that he, being terrified with suche examples, may both temper himselfe from sinne, and wickednesse, and also loue, and embrace vertue and godlinesse.
Moreouer, wee set downe before him certeine places out of the holy Scriptures (worthie to be remembred) which are fitte for this purpose, and amongest other sayinges, that chiefly, whiche is in the Epistle to the Hebrewes: He that despiseth Moses lawe, dieth without
Of howe much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be worthie, which treadeth vnder foote the Sonne of God, and counteth the bloud of the Testament as an vnholie thing, wherewith he was sanctified, and doeth despite the spirit of grace? And that saying out of the second Epistle of Saint Peter: For, if they, after they
haue fledde backe from the filthinesse of the worlde, through the acknowledging of the Lord, and of the Sauiour Iesus Christ, are notwithstanding yet againe entangled therein and ouercome, their latter end is worse with them tha~ their beginning.
them, not to haue knowen the way of righteousnesse, than after they haue knowen it, to turne from the holy commaundement geuen vnto them.
Saint Peter speaketh these wordes of those men, who like as the dogge returneth to his owne vomite (as it is saied in the common Prouerbe) or, as the Sow that was washed, returneth to her wallowing in the mire: so they slide backe againe afreshe into their sinnes, and wickednesse.
Wherefore by these, and such like both examples, and threates of the Scripture, we goe about to terrifie, and call backe the repentant person from sinne.
Before all thinges we exhort him to see well to this,
that not onely he himselfe doe not willingly, against his owne conscience rush headlong into sinne (for so he might loose both faith, and the holy spirit, neither could he be in fauour with God:) or that he doe not pamper too much (as the common sorte of men is woont to doe) the tendernesse of his minde: but also that with all might and maine he resist, and withstand Sathan
mouing him to mischiefe, that he alwayes beware most diligently of the snares, and trappes which the diuell hath laide for him, that he yeelde not to him, that setteth pleasure as an obiect before him, or to him which is desirous to ensnare, and allure him with the inticementes of vices: finally, that he shunne all occasions, and cut off as it were the handles to sinne.
Neither, if he once happily obteine the victorie ouer his enimie, let him not by by hope for truce, peace,
as though he were past all perill, but let him remember that he must alwayes stande in the forefront of the battell: neither, if he bee vanquished and ouercome, let him despaire, nor if he bee victor, let him swell with any secrete pride.
And let him verily enterprise al these things, not trusting
to his owne strength, and power, but hauing his hope, and his whole assurance placed in Gods ayde and assistance, and calling vppon the sonne of God in godlie prayers for helpe.
In the meane space, in our Ecclesiasticall meeting, wee warne him to repaire very often to the Lordes table: to the end that hee, by receiuing Christes body, may both be stirred vp to the remembrance of the promise concerning forgiuenesse of sinnes, and also confirmed concerning Gods good will, and celestiall fauour towardes him.
For the holy Ghost doeth vse this Supper as a meane, and as it were an instrument to raise vp in vs assured confidence in Christ, and loue towardes our neighbour.
Now, as Baptisme is a perpetuall signe of that free remission of sinnes, and of that reconciliation for Christes sake: so the Supper of the Lord doeth testifie, and witnesse vnto vs, that those benefits last and dure for euer at all times in the Church of Christ, and that they are not voyde, and of none effect streightway, no not in very great, and greeuous falles, if so be wee, being touched with repentance, doe flee vnto the exceeding great mercie of God for Christ, if we desire forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and that not without a feruent desire, and studie, to returne againe into fauour, and friendship with God, nor without a most firme purpose to amende our liues, and to keepe, and obserue hereafter Gods Pawe.
of his bodie, and bloude should be a perpetuall monument, and pledge of his loue towards vs: namely, that wee, repenting from our hearte, may (after we haue receiued this pledge) stirre vp our faith, and be persuaded that wee haue our sinnes forgiuen vs for Christes sake, who offered vp him selfe for vs vpon the altar of his Crosse a lambe immaculate, and vnspotted, that wee by this assurance might comfort our selues, and might
raise vp, and holde vp our afflicted conscience, that wee might giue thankes to God for so greate a benefite, that wee might declare this our thankfullnesse towardes God in our whole life, in all our actions, and that wee might (as the Apostle saith) shew foorth the Lordes death perpetually: finally, that wee being put in minde by this pledge, may euery way boldely trust, that wee are now the members of Christ, and that Christes benefites belong vnto vs.
instituted for this cause (as saide before, but must say it oftener) that wee vsing it, might both exercise, and confirme our faith, and also that wee our selues might bee comforted with the remembrance, and memoriall of the Lordes death, which brought saluation to vs: that so at the length wee might giue that thankes to God, and to the sonne of God, which wee doe woorthily owe vnto them.
Very few in the former age knew this vse of the sacrament, called the Eucharist.
If perhaps any calamitie fall vpon him, or if our heauenly
father mercifully chastise him for some deserued offence, wee bid him suffer it stoutly, and with a chearefull minde, and to remember that by that meanes hee is called to repentance, that so God hath giuen him an occasion to exercise his faith, that so hee is pricked forward to prayer, that so that slouthfullnesse, and deade
sleepe (which in prosperitie possesseth mens minds) is shaken off: finally, that so our mindes are stirred vp, and awakened, to acknowledge our sinnes, to amend our life, to despise all humane, and earthlie thinges.
there hath bene almost no other thing woont to be intreated of, than of mens traditions, of forged fables, lying tales, and feigned miracles of Saintes, of vaine visions, and apparitions of shadowes, of vowes, of Pilgrimages, of indulgencies, and pardons, of offering vp a
reward to the Stationarie souldiers, of the caue or Purgatorie of S. Patrike, and of such like trifles: here our Preachers at this day in their Sermons doe teache, and
tell vs of faith in Christ, of charitie towardes our neighbour, of true inuocation, of the crosse or affliction, of repentance, and of the fruites of repentance, of iustification, of those woorkes which may bee truely tearmed good woorkes, of the Supper of the Lorde, of bringing vp children in the feare of the Lorde, of liberalitie towardes the poore, and of such like pointes necessarie to saluation: to bee briefe, they preach those thinges verie much, or rather those thinges onely, which become wholesome doctrine, as S. Paule warneth Titus.
Also in the same Sermous (as likewise priuately, and in secret confessions) both the rude and ignorant are
taught, and instructed, and the vnwarie are admonished, and the slouthfull are rebuked, the forward are incited, the weaklinges are strengthened, the afflicted are raised vp, those that straie, and wander out of the way, are brought in againe: they which are wholy displeased with them selues for the guilte of their sinne are comforted, they which sleepe secure in sinne are terrified, and made affraide with threates: and (not to vse many woordes) all men alike are pricked forward to leade their life after the will, and imitation of God, all men are willed to thinke vpon death, hanging daily ouer our heades by reason of vncerteine chaunces, and to prepare them selues for that day, wherein they must departe this life, neither to loose the time of repentance giuen vnto them by the benefite of God.
not nowe woont to bee alleadged, and cited can not tell what solemne Doctours, there are quoted
none of these subtile, none of these Seraphicall, finally, none of these irrefragable Doctours: as, Albert, Thomas Aquinas, Petrus Lombardus, Rabbanus, Nicolaus de Lira, Dunse, Dorbell, Occam, and other such like, which heretofore were rife in the Papistes mouthes: but now Moses, the Prophets, Christ, the Apostles, and the Euangelistes, are cited, to
proue, and confirme the matter, which they doe there entreate of.
Thus you haue our minde, and meaning: namely, what kinde of man wee at this day woulde haue him to bee, who professeth him selfe to bee a Christian not more in woorde, than in deede.
You haue also a summe of Christian doctrine, comprehended verie briefly in fewe woordes, the verie same, which is taught amongst vs: Whereby you may easily learne, what hath bene amended in Ecclesiasticall doctrine.
Now wee will proceede to declare, what hath bene either chaunged, or quite taken away in Ceremonies: but first we will speake somewhat of the Pope or Bishop of Rome.
Creede, that the Pope was by Gods lawe head of the Church.
But wee after the iudgement of S. Paule doe affirme, that Christe alone is the head of the Church.
For the place out of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and
Wee denie not this, that the Bishop of Rome may, by the generall consent of the other Bishops, bee appointed as it were a certeine
superintendent, or ouerseer of the Churches, and a president of the Christian common weale, that hee may both bee, and also seeme to be, as it were a Censour of mens manners, a maister of Ecclesiasticall discipline,
if so bee hee woulde vse his authoritie graunted not to get any Lordship, or souereigntie ouer others, but to the profit of the Church: not to bring in superstition, but to establish true religion, and if hee woulde throughly doe the duetie belonging to the function taken in hand: finally, if hee woulde bee bounde to certeine lawes of gouernement, neither would permit (as he hath done heretofore) that his owne lust, and licence should stand for a lawe.
onely with the Popes kingdome, and with the Romish ruledome, and with that power, which would aduance it selfe both aboue the Scripture, and the Church, and almost aboue God him selfe: neither seeme they to graunte vnto any mortall man whatsoeuer, as long as they can helpe it, to be able to doe more than the woorde of God, and the Church.
Otherwise knowe full well they will not refuse the authoritie of the Bishop of Rome, if hee will take paines to see that Christian Religon bee instaured, that superstitions bee taken away, that the Churches bee reformed, that the manners of all estates bee corrected, and amended.
And if that authoritie of the Bishop (which at the beginning was graunted for the better preseruation of Christianitie, of consent in doctrine) had not bene turned into domination, or rather tyrannie, our men truely would neuer haue bene persuaded to haue violated, cast off, and to haue banished (as it were) out of the Church, that authoritie.
Therefore, no other man, but the Bishop of Rome him selfe, is the cause, why that Apostolicall seate (as they call it) hath bene so despised: neither can the Bishop accuse any man for that matter more iustly than him selfe.
For who can thinke it tollerable, that hee should call him selfe, The vniuersall and Oicomenicall Bishop, who hath the right to ordeine, and to confirme, to displace,
and remoue from their office all the Bishops, and Pastours in the whole world? that hee doth arrogate vnto him self the authoritie of making lawes concerning the seruice and woorship of God, concerning the chaunging of the Sacraments, concerning Ecclesiasticall doctrine? that hee doth thinke his owne decrees to be equall with Gods lawes, so that all mens consciences are necessarily bounde to the obseruing of them, if they will see to their owne saluation? that hee doth sit in the Temple of God, as God: as S. Paule saith of Antichrist,
and that hee doth take vnto him the right of chaunging the doctrine of Christ, and the woorshippes appointed by God? that hee doth suffer him selfe to bee iudged of no man, and that hee doth preferre his owne authoritie before the iudgement of Councelles, and of the whole Christian Church? that hee doth not suffer Ecclesiasticall controuersies to bee decided rightly, and orderly, and that in Synodes hee doth not suffer any thing to be iudged, and concluded against his sentence? that hee challengeth vnto him selfe the authoritie to translate from one to an other both kingdomes and Empires? that hee sticketh hard to this: how that by Gods lawe hee is Lord of all the kingdomes of the worlde? finally, that hee boasteth how that hee is the Emperours lawfull successour, when the Empire is vacant: and that hee doth confirme this, howe that it is necessarie to saluation to beleeue it? But let vs come now to Ceremonies.
vulgar tongue, than the Latine: because verie few vnderstand this, but all vnderstand the other: that is, both the Godfathers, and Godmothers, which are brought thither, and adhibited as witnesses at the baptisme of the childe, and also the rest of the congregation, if any bee present: and lastly, the Priest him selfe, which doth
necessarie, that all shoulde vnderstand that language, wherein the childe is baptised: namely, to this end, both that the Godfathers may knowe what they doe professe, and promise to God in the childes name: and also that the rest, which stand aboute, may not bee ignorant what matter is in hande, how serious, how diuine, and how full of mysteries it is: finally, that the Prieste may bee occupied in that holie mysterie with greater attention of minde, that he may thereby bee excited to a more exquisite diligence: and that hee may bee forced the better to doe his duetie for shame of all those, which are present, vnderstanding now what is done.
Iustinian the Emperour maketh for vs in his Nouellis Constitutionibus, de capitibus Ecclesiasticorum sumptuum: whose woordes doe omitte, lest should bee longer than needed.
baptising belles, and of hallowing water with salte, brought into the Church by superstitious men, wee thought good in any wise to reteine it no longer.
Concerning Penance, and Confession, if the abuses which haue crept in, bee taken away, wee both thinke and teach verie highly of it.
clearely, and plainely testifie, that there can bee no way any true faith in a man, without repentance: that is, but in him who is truely sorrowfull, and greatly greeued for his sinnes: but in him which repenteth seriously and from his hearte, and which feeleth the wrathe of God against his sinnes: but in him, which purposing now to liue godly, doth call to God for mercie, doth goe vnto the Minister of the Church, and confessing his sinnes doth desire absolution of him.
curious, and scrupulous enumeration, or reckoning vp of their seuerall sinnes, with all the cirumstances perteining to it: as what was done, with what minde, with whome, at what time, howe long, where, howe often, wherefore, howe much, howe farre foorth, with what reason, and other such like: this wee reiect as both full of superstition, and also euerie way vnprofitable, and (as it were) a certeine snare, or rather a butcherie, and crosse of miserable consciences.
For that punishment, which Iesus Christ suffered for vs, and which brought saluation to vs, is the onely satisfaction for all the sinnes of the whole worlde.
And truely they, which are of opinion, that sinne may bee recompensed with fastinges, with Pilgrimages, with indulgencies, and such like toyes, or that Gods wrathe may any other way bee pacified, rather than by the death of the Sonne of God, doe not sufficiently ponder either the weight of sinne it selfe, or the wrathe of GOD against our sinne.
the auncient rites and ceremonies, instituted either for example sake, and for discipline, or perteining to some amendement of life, which smell not of gaine, or couetousnesse.
And wee doe thinke that they, which confesse their faultes, ought againe, and againe, to bee exhorted to bring foorth those fruites which become true repentance.
Yea, wee bid euen them which haue falne againe into sinne to satisfie (as it were) to pacifie God through the sorowe of repentance, through the sighes of humilitie, through the sacrifice of
contrite heart, as Dauid saith: also wee bid them now
chaunge their olde yll manners for better, to reconcile God vnto them by almes deedes, and by liberalitie towardes the poore, which is principally (to vse Tertullians
wordes) Dei misericordiae illex, that is to say, verie prouoker of Gods mercie: finally, wee will them to bee warie, heedie, and diligent, to auoyd those sinnes, into which they haue once fallen, wee bid them take heede by all meanes, and beware, that they offend not either in woorde, or deede: yea, that they commit not any thing in thought, which is either euill to bee done, or wicked to be saide.
Now, wee neither can, nor ought, to allow that necessitie
of certeine woorkes, which was woont to bee put vpon those, which had confessed their sinnes, and that way of satisfying for their sinnes, and of deseruing deliuerance from the punishments of Purgatorie fire, prescribed to the people by the sacrificing Priestes.
thinke: that the true Masse in the Church of God is that common Supper of the Lorde, in which the bodie, and bloud of our Lorde is distributed, to renew the memorie of the most wholesome death of Christ, and of his torments, which hee suffered for the redemption of mankinde.
For the Fathers, and Doctours of the Church in old time, vsed to call the Supper of the Lord,
sacrifice, for that it was instituted, and ordained to this end: to wit, that the same might stirre vs vp to the remembrance of that sacrifice of Christ, who offered vp himselfe to his father vpon the crosse a sacrifice for the sinnes of the world, according to that saying of Christ: Doe this in remembrance of mee.
forgett Christes death, Christ now readie to passe out of this worlde vnto his father, left vnto vs a memoriall
of himselfe: namely, his body in the Eucharist, and mysticall banket.
the true, right vse of the Eucharist, according to the institution of Christ, and according to the obseruation of the primitiue Church: to wit, that it might be the communion of Christian people, to the receiuing, and participation of the bodie, and bloud of our Lorde Iesus Christ, that it might also be a thankesgeuing
whence it taketh his name, of the Greeke worde Eucharistia: and finally, that it might be a godly recordation, and remembrance of that one onely sacrifice of Christ, and of that immolation done vppon on the altar of the Crosse.
of those men, which with this sacrifice worship Saintes, which by it deliuer the dead from the fire of Purgatorie, which thinke they doe obteine for others either pardon of their sinnes, or an happie successe in their affaires.
And we denie not that to be true, which that
instaurer of auncient Diuinitie complaineth of: namely, that heretofore the Masse hath bene either a gaine for filthie Massemonging Priestes, or else a trustie staffe, and staie for all men, that haue ledde an euill life.
For we must needes confesse that, which by no meanes can be denied.
But also as concerning the taking away of the cup fro~ the Laie people, which is contrarie to Gods institution,
wee doe not thinke it to bee in any wise allowable: as likewise neither that reseruation of the Lordes bread, nor that ostentation, and open shewe of it in publike Processions, and Ecclesiasticall pompes.
wholy taken away those ceremonies, which helpe nothing at all to promote, and further godlinesse: yea, which rather hurt, and hinder it: as the consecration, and hallowing of salte, and of herbes, the aspersion, or sprinkling of holie water, the circumgestation, or carrying
about of images, and pictures, the fuming, and burning of Franckincense before the altars of Saintes, the baptising of belles, the yeerely exequies, and solemnities for the dead, the obseruation, and keeping of the houres of our Ladie, other innumerable like to these, which are ioyned with a certeine impietie, and superstition.
The thirde parte of this discourse, wherein the obiections of the Aduersarie are plainely refuted.
NOwe let Us fall to the third part of this book, wherein, as muche as in vs lieth, we will labour to confute those things, which in this cause are woont to be brought against vs.
First of all, many men are offended at this, that our Preachers teach of onely faith in Christ: but truely, if we will iudge aright, they are offended without any weightie, or probable cause at the least, much more without any iust, and necessarie cause.
For when as wee say, that wee are iustified by faith alone,
wee doe not take away good deedes, or honest actions: but wee exclude confidence, and trust in woorkes, and wee shut out mens merites, which ought to haue no place in the matter of iustification.
But all men (almost) were heeretofore fully persuaded, that these merites of men were of abilitie, and power, to remit sinnes, and to satisfie for them: in so much that the Monkes would not freely communicate to others their woorkes of supererogation (which they had lesse neede
of themselues to their owne saluation:) but would set them to sale at a price, if any man would redeeme them with monie.
that all the trust, and assurance of our saluation ought to bee put, and placed in the onely free mercie, and reconciliation of God for Christ, who gaue himselfe an expiatorie sacrifice for mankinde.
verely the condition of dignitie and merite: the same we doe say with the Ecclesiasticall fathers, Sola fide,
by faith alone: least you should thinke the mutation of the wordes to change the thing it selfe.
These things, as suppose, are both so cleare, and euident, that they may be easily vnderstood: also proued by our men with so firme testimonies, that they can by no meanes be refelled.
For in summe, we teach this, that men obteine pardon
of their sinnes, and are iustified by the free fauour, mercie of God onely, promised for Christ our Mediatours sake, if so be they doe place the assured trust of their saluation onely in Christ our propitiator peacemaker, and if so be they doe by faith embrace the merit of Christ, who by his pretious bloud satisfied God for all mens sinnes.
For there is no man which can obteine saluation, but he which doeth by faith receiue, and apprehend free remission of sinnes, offered of God for Christes sake, and which holdeth fast this confidence vnto the end.
Therefore we are iustified not through any dignitie, or worthinesse of our woorkes, neither
through our merites, and desertes: but (as the Apostle saith) by the bloud of Christ: as the same Paule saith, freely, by the grace of God himselfe through the redemption, which is in Christ Iesus, whom God hath set forth a propitiator through faith by the meanes of his bloud, &c. Hitherto tendeth that of S. Peter out of the Actes: By the grace (saieth he) of our Lorde Iesus
To make an end: when as wee say that wee are iustified by faith
onely, wee meane no other thing, but that saluation is geuen vnto vs of Christ onely, and that this saluation is to be receiued, and taken hold on by faith alone, for otherwise it can not be applied vnto vs.
For, faith is (as it were) an instrument, or hande, by
which that saluation, which is offered, is receiued, and apprehended of vs.
They which say that wee exclude repentance, Baptisme, Christes merite, and the grace
of God, when wee make mention of faith alone, are verely vnworthie to whome we should giue any answer.
For wee are not disposed to refell those thinges whiche are manifestly false, nor to reproue so impudent a lye. Onely wee take away trust in our owne merits, and wee signifie vnto all men, that the hope of our saluation
ought to be put in Gods goodnesse, and clemencie promised to vs for Christes sake.
Hitherto perteineth that of S. Ambrose vnto Irinaeus: Nemo (inquit) glorietur in operibus, quia nemo factis suis iustificatur: sed qui iustus est, donatum habet, quia post lauacrum iustificatus est: that is: Let no man glorie in his woorkes, because no man is iustified by his deedes: but he that is iust hath it by gift, because hee is iustified after regeneration.
It is therfore faith alone which deliuereth, and setteth vs free by the bloud of Christ: because that hee is blessed (saith the Psalmist) who hath his sinnes remitted, and whose
Yea, and S. Augustine also in a certeine place witnesseth that the beleeuing are iustified and saued by the onely grace of Christ.
writing against the Pelagians saith thus: Vna fides est, quae omnes saluos facit, qui ex carnali generatione in spiritualem renascendo saluantur, that is, There is but one faith which saueth all men which are saued, by being borne againe from the carnall generation, vnto the spirituall regeneration.
And writing vnto Bonifacius hee saith thus: Quantaelibet fuisse virtutis antiquos praedices iustos, non eos saluos fecit nisi fides Mediatoris, qui in remissionem peccatorum sanguinem fudit, that is: For how great vertues soeuer thou doest praise those iust men of olde time, nothing saued them, but faith in the Mediatour, who shead
his bloud for the remission of sinnes, These thinges saith S. Austine, speaking of the holie fathers of the old Testament.
now renewed, doe obiect vnto vs, that we attribute lesse to good woorkes, than indeed is meete, conuenient: that they, being brought into contempt, are now altogether neglected: yea, and that good woorkes are indeed taken away, and that they are left onely in name.
First and formost, albeit in the matter, and manner of
iustification, wee attribute no parte, or parcell vnto our woorkes: (whiche thing we doe, lest wee shoulde make mens merites the price, and satisfaction for sinne, for eternall death:) notwithstanding otherwise we doe not at all refuse them.
Hence it is, that our Preachers spend so much labour,
trauell in expounding, and making plaine the Decalogue, or ten co~mandements.
Hence it is, that as much as we may, wee exhort men to good woorkes: because they doe ratifie, and testifie, our faith to be a true faith, and because they declare our will to bee gratefull, and thankfull to God for his benefites, and because they doe adorne, and set out the doctrine of the Gospel, lastly for that they inuite, stirre vp others to the studie of
Yet for all this, wee teach that they must be done, not through hope by them to satisfie for our sinnes, or of a trust to obteine righteousnesse by them: but either to the glorie of God, or to the vse, and necessitie of our neighbour.
maimed after a sorte, and vnperfect, if no good deedes or dueties towards our neighbour followe.
For faith (as S. Ambrose saith) is the roote of all vertues: the foun+teine,
and welspring of all good woorkes, as S. Austin saith: the mother of euerie good will, and iust action,
the Author of the booke, De vocatione Gentium, saith: the breeder, and bringer foorth of all right actions, as Chrysostome saith: the same faith is not idle, slouthfull,
but doing working alwayes, S. Paul saith to the Galathians it woorketh effectually by loue.
wee denie that faith can bee, and abitle in that man, which liueth wickedly, and vngodly, and which obeyeth his lustes, and yeeldeth to his concupiscences against his owne conscience.
For we do iudge, that neither manslayers, nor theeues, nor extortioners, nor adulterers, nor couetous misers, nor proude persons, nor dronkardes, and such like fellowes, can (vnles they repent) haue any faith beleefe, that God the Father will be fauourable,
And wee teache (as our aduersaries doe agree with vs) that these things, namely, the habite, purpose, and deliberation of offending, are furthest off from a true faith.
For he that sinneth wittingly, and willingly, that man without doubt contemneth, despiseth, and nothing regardeth God.
Now, such contempt can in no wise agree with a firme faith, and stedfast trust in God.
Iohn witnesseth, the beleeuers doe conquere, and vanquishe the worlde, and sith that they, which perseuere in vice and wickednesse, are thought not to beleeue: truly there can bee no true faith in such, but perhaps a certeine hypocrisie, and a certeine idle, and vaine dreame of faith, howsoeuer otherwise the aduersaries of wholesome doctrine doe cry out against it: who, when as light is nowe restored vnto the worlde, had rather embrace darkenesse, than loue the light.
For our aduersaries doe say commonly, that almost those onely are good woorkes, which wee haue rehearsed before, to witte, Pilgrimages, woorshipping of images, burning of Franckincense,
and such like odours, inuocation of Saintes, and such like ioyned with impietie, and idolatrie, or els full of the greatest follie, and madnesse that may bee, and whiche God did not prepare that wee shoulde walke in them, as Saint Paule saith.
indeed, but yet such as rather perteine to discipline, and to the exercise of the body, than to true godlinesse: as, abstinence from daintie meates, often fastinges, watchinges, lying vppon the bare grounde, the necessitie of liuing according to the prescript of man, and such like: by whiche the flesh is after a sorte bridled, that it may not waxe wanton, and lasciuious, and that it may not exult too immoderately out of all measure.
These woorkes wee very well like, allowe of, albeit wee doe not esteeme, and set so much by them altogether, as the vnskilfull people was woont to doe: but wee doe farre preferre before these workes those, which come neerer to true godlinesse, of which wee will speake hereafter.
And verely the common people, if they see any men leane with hunger, broke with trauell, brought lowe with watching, doe much magnifie them for an opinion of holinesse, by these things they doe esteeme godlinesse.
Neither co~meth it seldome to passe, but very often, that
men swell secretly in pride, and are puffed vp in minde about that externall hypocrisie of good woorkes, which so glorieth, boasteth it selfe in the eyes of the people.
Yea, those same works are now then kept obserued more superstitiously than needed, and well nigh with a Iudaicall mind, as if in these the greatest godlinesse that can bee did consist: wheras indeed they bring small profite with them, vnlesse those true workes be in them to, which Christ inculcateth, beateth into the eares, and
And it may be that hee which pineth his bodie with fasting, which breaketh it with paines taking, which corrupteth it with watching, which of his owne accorde abstaineth for euer from wine and flesh, which goeth in beastly beggerly apparell, which lieth vppon the bare grounde, which beareth heate and colde, it may be, say, that he in the meane time is not farre estranged from ambition, from wrath, from enuie, from priuie grudges, hartburning, from other vices wickednesse, though by this hardnesse, austeritie of life he haue gotten him a great opinion of holinesse among all men, though he wonderfully please him self in these his outward workes: as in fastinges, watchings, lyinges vpon the grounde, and in the obseruation of such like things, as did the whole companie of Monkes and Friers.
Last of all, there are woorkes very good and Euangelicall,
which Christ inculcateth, which the doctrine of the Apostles commendeth, whiche the ten Commaundementes doe conteine.
What they bee wee haue declared before: as, the feare of God, assured trust in God, inuocation or calling vppon God, thankesgiuing
to God, patience in afflictions, all kindes of dueties towardes our neighbour, liberalitie towards the poore, the rest which wee rehearsed before.
These onely are the workes whereby yow may knowe a true Christian man.
For he is not to be thought to liue Christianly, (as the Apostle saith) woorthie of God, whiche doeth the first kinde of workes, which calleth vpon Saintes, which gaddeth
into wooddes, and desertes, which redeemeth and buieth indulge~cies, which sprinkleth him self with holie water, which weareth a waxe candle consecrated by the
Pope: nor if a man busie him selfe aboute the second sort of workes, if he fast, if he watch, if he lie harde vpon the
ground, if he teare, rent his owne bodie with stripes,
if he flee, and auoyde all delicates, and dainties, the obseruation of whiche thinges was woont heeretofore to puffe vp the Monkes, with intollerable pride: but he onely is to bee thought to liue Christianly, which studieth,
and endeuoureth to declare, and manifest his faith to the worlde, by the last kinde of woorkes, that is to say: whiche repenteth perpetually, which feareth GOD truely, whiche loueth him vnfeignedly, whiche
calleth vppon him in trouble, and aduersitie, whiche giueth him thankes in prosperitie, which laudeth, praiseth, and confesseth God at all times, whiche is patient in miseries, and calamities, which is modest in the prosperitie of this life, which is diligent in his duetie, which is temperate in his diet, apparell, which is iust, vpright to his neighbor, which is bountifull to the poore, which tolerateth iniuries, which prayeth for the~ which curse him, which beareth good will to them which owe ill will to him, which deserueth well of them which hurt him, which feedeth the hungrie, which giueth drinke to the thirstie, and the rest which we haue rehearsed, which are truely and indeed good woorkes, and worthily beseeming a Christian man.
Wherefore these woorkes we teach, to these woorkes wee exhorte men, these workes wee vrge continually without end.
This greeueth our aduersaries sore, that both wee flatly reiect the first kind of workes, also that we set not
such store by the second sort of workes, as the ignorant people are woont to doe, lastly, that we inculcate the third kind of works oftner tha~ they can bere, abide it.
Secondly, this also vexeth them, that wee had rather ascribe our saluation to the free fauour, and mercie of
God for Christ, than vnto mens merites, good works, that wee condemne them, which put their trust, and affiance in good deedes, whiche of them selues seeke to satisfie for their owne sinnes, whiche promise vnto
them selues for their woorkes, both deliuerance from eternall punishment, also blessed immortalitie: which thinke that heauen is due to their good deedes: and chiefly them, whiche are accustomed not to communicate with other men freely their ouerflowing merites, but for siluer and gold readie told.
Finally, they take it very greeuously, and in great snuffe, that wee doe teach
(according to that precept of the Apostle: Flee the worshipping of idols) that their manifest superstition, impietie, and idolatrie in worshipping of images, in calling vppon the dead, in the prophanation of the Supper of the Lorde, in the trust of mens traditions, (wherein Monkerie wholy depended) ought to bee shunned, auoyded of all men.
This verely is the cause why they cry out so much that good workes are indeed vtterly taken away, left only in worde name.
Now, as oft as they crie out, complaine, that religion is polluted, defiled, that rites, and ceremonies are violated, broken, that the woorship, seruice of God is neglected: so often they do not speake of the third, last forte of workes, which we doe chiefly vrge, but either of the light toyes, foolish trifles of the first kinde of woorkes, which wee (as saide before) vtterly reiect: or of the labours, and exercises of the seconde sorte of woorkes, apperteining rather to a straite discipline, than to sincere godlinesse, which exercises verely we doe not improue, and disallowe, if so bee there bee no superstition, or other faulte in them, albeit wee accounte them woorthie to bee placed farre vnder the thirde kinde of woorkes, euen as Saint Paule warneth vs to doe.
writeth thus: Exercise thy selfe vnto godlinesse: for bodilie exercise profiteth little: but godlinesse is profitable vnto all thinges.
Now, although perhaps a few fonde fellowes speake not warily, and wisely enough,
of woorkes, the fault and blame of a fewe must not be
For euen in S. Augustines age there wanted not certeine Pastours, and Preachers, which did offend almost in the like manner, and did blab out many things amongst the people vnaduisedly, and rashly, neither to edification (as the Apostle saith) nor to profite.
Concerning which matter passe not muche, if set downe his owne wordes.
Absit (inquit) vt dicamus vobis: Uinite vt vultis, securi estote, Deus neminem perdit, tantùmmodò fidem Christianam tenete.
Non perdit ille quos redemit, non perdet pro quibus sanguinem suum fudit: si spectaculis volueritis oblectare animos vestros, ite. Impleamini cibo, vino: ad hoc enim data est ista creatura, vt perfruamini, &c, that is, God forbid (saith S. Austine) that we should say vnto you: Liue as ye list, be secure carelesse, God destroyeth no man, onely hold fast the Christian faith.
He will not destroy them whom he hath redeemed, he will not destroy them for whom he hath shead his bloud: and if ye be disposed to solace your mindes with shewes and spectacles, goe to them on Gods name.
Fill your bellies with good meates, and wines: for this creature was geuen of God to this end, that ye should enioy it, &c.
this day doe bid all men make an end of their owne saluation with feare and trembling, and to beware that their heartes be not ouerladen with surfeting, and dronkennesse, nor that they ouerwhelme themselues with wine, wherein is excesse: we bid them to watch, and to be sober: to eate meate not for pleasure, but for necessitie to sustaine life: we bid them pray daily, and without intermission, and eftsoones by fasting to prepare themselues to prayer: we declare that the Apostle doth
reckon amongst the woorkes of the flesh both dronkennesse, and riotous banqueting, and that the same Apostle doeth denie that they, which are wholy giuen to
concerning woorkes, it appeareth plainly what notable iniurie they doe vnto vs, which say that we attribute lesse to good woorkes than is meete, and conuenient: and which for that cause call vs haters of all good workes, fighters, and warriours against good woorkes, yea, verie hangmen of good woorkes.
For albeit we doe not inculcate those monasticall, flat superstitious workes,
to wit, filthie attire, hatred of wedlock, choyce of meats, babling of prayers (as Christ calleth it,) vowes, watchinges,
fastes, and such like: notwithstanding we teache men both truely to forsake the world (which thing we haue all professed, promised to doe in our Baptisme) and also to liue godly, holily, and religiously.
And we shew verely that that same may be done, marie,
not if thou thrust and shroude thy selfe into some wildernesse, and hide thy selfe close in a Monasterie, which in old time was a foule fault, and a great errour: not if thou voluntarily seeke, and procure thine owne harme, and cruelly afflict thine owne body: finally, not if thou cast away of thine owne accord, and refuse those goodes, and possessions, which thou hast, nor by any such meanes.
How then pray you? If thou take it well in woorth whatsoeuer God doth vnto thee, and howsoeuer he dealeth with thee: if thou doest vse thy wealth, and all thy riches, with thankesgiuing, when thou hast them, and canst willingly be content to want them, as oft as God taketh them from thee.
If thou doe neither procure voluntarily thine owne vexations, and tormentes, nor refuse calamities and sorrowes sent of God: if thou neither despaire in aduersitie, nor be insolent and proude in prosperitie: if both thou liue contented with thy present state, and also omitte the carking care for thinges to come: if thou neither murmur, and grudge
at the griefe of ill things, nor loath, and mislike the plentie of good things: if thou hast monie, so that thou put no trust in it, that thou spend it in godlie vses, that thou be neither sorie for the losse of it, nor be puffed vp with the abundance of it: not to vse many wordes, if thou alwayes beare and suffer with one, and the same minde, and countenance, (how soeuer it shall seeme good vnto almightie God,) riches, pouertie, scarsitie, plentie, abundance, penurie, glorie, ignominie, honor, dishonor, losse, gaine, health, sicknesse, and such like, whether they bee hard or softe, sharpe and sowre, or pleasant and sweete: and if thou giue thankes to the Lorde alwayes for all thinges, both gladsome, and sorrowfull thinges, howsoeuer matters fall out, ill or well.
This is onely to renounce, and forsake the world truely, this is truely to addict, and consecrate himselfe wholy to God, this is truely to renounce Sathan the prince of the world.
Hitherto also perteine these, to be farre from pride, from auarice, from excesse, from ambition, from vaine glorie, from hatred, from enuie, from desire of reuenge, and from such like affections, which are repugnant, and contrarie to the spirit of Christ.
Also, both to doe, and to speake curteously to all men, to embrace other men with a certeine brotherlie good will and loue, to procure other mens profite, and commoditie, before his owne, to account other mennes miserie his owne, to weepe at others mens calamities: what blessing, gift of God soeuer thou hast, to impart it wholy to the helping of others: briefly, in all thinges which thou thinkest, speakest, doest, not to shoote at any other marke, than at the glorie of God onely, and at the profite, and saluation of thy neighbour: to referre all thy deedes, sayinges, counselles, and deuises, all thy desires, endeuours, trauelles, all thy studies, cogitations, cares, labours,
watchings, carefulnesse, to the amplifying of Gods praise, to the succouring, releeuing of mortall men, in any thing thou canst doe: in the meane time to ascribe, and arrogate nothing to thine owne strength, neither to despise other men as sinners, but both to acknowledge thine owne imbecillitie, and also to trust onely to Gods fauour, and clemencie.
Thus you haue heard what woorkes we doe inculcate, and beate into the eares, and mindes of men.
They finde great fault with vs for this, that we teach, that it is a good woorke to sweepe the pauement, or
floore, to hew downe trees, or to cleaue wood, and such like, sith that the Ethnikes also, and Pagans doe that.
As though it bee not a good woorke, though it seeme a base, and contemptible labour, whatsoeuer a man doth according to Gods commaundement, in his office, and trade of life.
Therefore that seruant, which at his maisters commandement heweth wood, and the drudge, or kitching slaue, which carrieth out of doores all the filth in the house, doeth verely a worke no lesse acceptable to God, than he which preacheth, prayeth, and singeth.
why so? because looke whatsoeuer God him selfe hath commaunded to bee done, he doeth well accept it: as contrarily he refuseth, and reiecteth those thinges, concerning which he neuer gaue commaundement in any place.
Wherefore, this must bee beaten into the eares, and mindes of all men, (which our aduersaries are not ashamed to blame vs for,) that euerie man endeuour to defend duely, to doe rightly, that office function which he beareth.
And wherefore, pray you, should a maide, preparing her maisters dinner, or making beds, lesse please God, than a sacrificing, or Masse Priest, which mumbleth vp his Mattins, or hourlie prayers, seing that
shee doeth obey Gods commaundement, whereas hee only obeyeth mens prescript? Yea, that may vrge them more: If a seruing man, being commaunded of his maister
(who is to ride a soudeine, and a necessarie iournie,) to dresse his horse, and to make him readie, would in the meane season be present either at seruice, or at the Sermon, must hee not be thought to doe yll? For howe could hee well doe it, sith that he ought not to refuse to doe his maisters will in those matters, which are not repugnant to Gods preceptes, as S. Paule in his Epistle
to the Ephesians, Colossians, and to Titus and S. Peter in his former Epistle teacheth? If hee therefore doe amisse, as we must confesse: why shoulde any man contemne those woorkes, whiche our aduersaries affirme that the very Ethnikes doe, hauing but nature for their guide? It appeareth wis how litle or nothing of Christian matters they vnderstand, who dare reiect, make no account of the woorkes of godlie men, whih albeit they are to the shew, vile and abiect, they are notwithstanding commaunded of God.
it is an excellent, and a not able woorke, to be at a Sermon? And yet for all that a baser, and a more abiecte woorke must be preferred before it, to witte, the dressing of an horse, if neede so require.
So the whole reason is altered and changed, that looke what the Ethnikes also doe by natures lore, that same must be preferred before that which Christians onely doe.
How much rather doe you thinke that to be preferred before those ambitious woorkes which are done before mens eyes, and which vaunte, and boaste them selues in mens sight, such as are these, Monasticall feigning
of pouertie, beastlie garmentes, long and superstitious fastes, prayers of Masse Priestes, and songes in the Church, whiche they doe not vnderstand, voluntarie rentinges and manglinges of their bodie, and such like?
Therefore, how foolishly doe they, yea how childishly are they wise, or rather foolish, which prefer rites found out by men, not ceremonies instituted by God, before the dueties of men, which walke (as the Scripture speaketh) in their vocation and calling? Howe much better, pray you, is it, and more agreeable to religion, if euerie man doe his duetie in that kind, trade of life, wherein hee is limited, that in the meane time hee neither preferre him selfe before others, nor despise other mens woorkes, though they bee base, nor thinke that they are lesse to bee set by, and lesse to be esteemed than his?
euerie where abroad, saying, that this renewed doctrine hath bene the cause, and occasion of them.
What then? Were there not both more heresies, more hurtfull
a greate deale in the Apostles times, than there haue bene in our age? Of which rhing wee might bring
foorth Irinaeus, and Epiphanius among the Greekes, and Tertullian, the most auncient Latine Doctour amongst the Ecclesiasticall writers, as substantiall, and sufficient witnesses.
Haue there not bene some at all times, which haue
both oppugned the true doctrine, and also repugned, and resisted godlie teachers? Did not Iannes, and Iambres resist, withstand Moses the man of God in Aegypt, as S. Paule witnesseth to Timothie? Did not Baals
Priestes resist Elias in Palestina? Did not the false Prophets resist Ieremie? Did not the Scribes, Pharisies, and high Priestes afterwardes resist Christ him selfe? Finally, did not both the Iewes, and the false brethren,
and also the idolaters, resist the Apostles? Therefore the blame of so many heresies, must not bee laied vpon the doctrine renewed, but vpon the malice of men, and of the Diuell.
of troubles, and raised at the preaching of the Gospell, concerning which matter wee haue spoken more at large otherwhere, in an other booke.
Last of all, they obiect vnto vs our licentious liuing,
and they thinke that this instauration of Ecclesiasticall doctrine, is the cause of our dissolute life.
The one of these two is truer than would: but the other is flatly
For it is the malice of Satan, that fewe at this day doe tread that pathway of liuing, which our Preachers
painefully, and diligently pointe vnto, out of the precepts of Christ, and out of the doctrine of the Apostles.
possible, to hinder, and stoppe the course of sinne, and wickednesse.
So farre is it, that the renewing of holy doctrine should bee the cause of dissolutenesse, loosenesse of life.
For wee doe exhorte men to repentance perpetually, and to amendement of life, wee will all men to flee from the anger to come, and we bid them
Also wee shewe them certeine souereigne remedies almost against all sinne, as it were against certeine diseases of the minde.

To bee briefe, wee doe without end inculcate that sentence of the Apostle: For wee must all appeare at the barre before the iudgement seate of Christ, that
euerie man may receiue the thinges, which hee hath done in his bodie, whether it bee good, or euill.
Moreouer, we daily make mention of the iudgement to come, of the voyce of the Archangel, and of the trumpet of God: of the Lordes tribunall seate, before which wee must all bee conuented, there to giue accomptes vnto God of our whole life, who will pay vnto euerie man as hee hath deserued, rewardes, or punishments, as both the Euangelicall, and Apostolicall doctrine testifieth.

The wife heareth this saying: Wiues, submit your selues vnto your husbandes, as vnto the Lord: because the husband is the wiues heade.

The rich man heareth this saying: Charge them that are riche in this
worlde, that they bee not high minded, and that they trust not in vncerteine riches, but in the liuing God, (which giueth vs aboundantly all thinges to enioy,) that they doe good, that they bee riche in good woorkes, that they bee readie to distribute, and willing to communicate to others, laying vp in store for them selues a good foundation against the time to come, that they may obteine eternall life.
Publicane, Customer, or Toulner, heareth this saying: Exact, and require no more, than that which is appointed you.
man, accuse no man falsly, but bee content with your wages.
Wherefore, sith. that our Preachers doe daily, perpetually beate into the eares, and mindes of all men, these, other innumerable sentences of holie Scripture,
seeing that they preach the word diligently, seeing that they are instant, and vrge men in season, and out of season, seeing that they improue, rebuke, and exhorte, as S. Paule warneth Timothie, they are falsly accused to haue hitherto pampered, and fostered to much the licentious liuing of the common people.
And yet notwithstanding, that which our aduersaries doe obiect of vice, and wickednesse, which beareth such a sway in this age, is (as saide before) truer than would it were.
the beginning of the Church, which did professe Christianitie rather in name, and title, than in verie deede, of which sorte Hilarie saith thus: They pray, because they feare: they sinne, because it is their will, pleasure: they
call them selues Christians, because they haue a good hope of eternitie: they doe heathenish thinges, because present thinges are flattering thinges: they remaine not altogether impious, because they haue the name of God in some honour: they are not godlie, because they followe such thinges as are farre from godlinesse: notwithstanding, doe beleeue, that all vices did scarse at
any time beare such a sway in any age, as in this our age.
Wee doe all of vs bragge, and boast of our faith, but wee doe not declare, and shewe forth this our

So it comes to passe, that for our sakes, and for our sinnes, and wickednesse, the name of God is
dispraised amongst the heathen, that Christian doctrine is euill spoken of, that religion it selfe is contemned, despised.
For what goodnesse will the Turkes beleeue to bee in that religion, whose woorshippers, and Professours they see to be contaminated, and defiled with all heinous wickednesse? ingratitude woorthie of eternall destruction.

The aduersaries of the Gospell, which will not acknowledge their manifest errours, and receiue the true doctrine, ought not so much to feare this so greeuous, and horrible a commination, as those which euerie where glorie of the Gospell, whome God hath called out of darkenesse into his maruellous light: that may vse the words of S.

children, that ye may walke in loue, euen as Christ hath loued vs, and hath geuen himselfe for vs to bee an offering, and a sacrifice of a sweete smelling sauour to God.
Christ Iesus vnto good woorkes, which God hath prepared, and ordeined that we should walke in them.
Hitherto perteineth that saying of Christ in Saint Matthaewes Gospell: Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good woorkes, and glorifie your father which is in heauen.
doe omitte almost sixe hundred such like places in the Gospell.
Those places of Scripture ought verely to moue vs chiefly, and before all other, which haue the mention of Christes death and punishment ioyned with them.
Such an one is that saying of Saint Peter: Christ (saith he)
his owne selfe bare our sinnes in his bodie on the tree.
For what doeth he adde? That we being dead to sinne, should liue to righteousnesse.
The like place is that to Titus: Christ (saith he) gaue himselfe for vs. What doth he adde? That he might redeeme vs from all iniquitie,
and purge vs to be a peculiar people vnto himselfe, zealous of good woorkes.
But he addeth: That he might deliuer, and take vs out of this present euill worlde.
He addeth: That they which liue should not liue hereafter to themselues, but vnto him, which died, and rose againe for them.
reconciled you in the bodie of his fleshe through death.
He addeth: To make you holie, and vnblameable, and without fault in his sight.
Now, whom the diuell (who, as Iohn saith in the Reuelation,
seduceth the whole worlde) feedeth with an hope of Gods mercie and goodnesse, and whom he by
that meanes reteineth still in their sinnes, and forbiddeth them to feare Gods iustice, let those men againe, and againe see well, what they doe.
The Lorde is mercifull, and gentle, saith Dauid in the Psalme.
But the same man saith, The face of the Lorde is against them
am the Lorde thy God, shewing mercie vpon thousandes, saith God in Exodus.
What is added? To them which loue mee, and keepe my commaundements.

What followeth? But that he turne from his wayes, and liue.

But Christ in the same S. Iohns Gospell saith: They which haue done good, shall come foorth into the
resurrection of life: but they that haue done euill into the resurrection of condemnation.
Iohn Baptist testifieth of Christ, saying: Behold that lambe of God, which
But the same Iohn saith: Repent yee of your former life, and bring foorth fruite worthie amendment of life.
Peter in the Actes saith: We beleeue that wee shall bee saued through the

Christe him selfe in Iohn saith: GOD so loued the worlde, that he gaue his onely begotten sonne, that whosoeuer beleeueth
one that saith vnto mee Lorde, Lorde, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but hee that doeth my fathers will, which is in heauen.
Paule saith vnto Timothie: Christ Iesus came into the worlde to
But the same Paule vnto the Corinthians saith; Bee not deceiued: neither fornicatours,
nor idolatours, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor theeues, nor couetous persons, nor dronkardes, nor railers, nor extortioners shall inherite the kingdome of God.
would to God, woulde to God, that wee would acknowledge in parte, and studie to be thankefull for so notable a benefite of GOD, in restoring this sacred doctrine, and that after so greate ignorance, and blindnesse of men in matters perteining to saluation, and which are chiefly necessarie to bee knowen.
wee, thinking vpon the infelicitie, and olde superstition of former times, and beeing as it were astonied at Gods greate benefites, would breake foorth into the praises of God, into Psalmes, and hymnes, into spirituall songes, singing and making melodie to the Lorde in our heartes, giuing thankes alwayes for all thinges vnto GOD, euen the father, in the name of our Lorde Iesus Christ, as the Apostle
Secondly, if wee woulde labour to promote, and set forward the ministerie of the woorde, to keepe, honour, to defend, and manteine godlie teachers, if we would labour to helpe, and releeue the necessarie studies of the Church.
Last of all, if wee woulde liue godly, and holily towardes God, patiently in afflictions, vprghtly towardes our neighbour, diligently in our duetie, temperately and soberly in our diet, and in our clothing, honorably towardes our parentes, obediently towardes our magistrates masters, louingly curteously with all men, liberally towards the poore needy: to be short, if we would liue innocently, chastely, soberly, friendly to our enimies, profitably to the Church of God, fauorably to the life of men, agreably to Religion, consonantly to Christianitie, conueniently meete for
the Gospell, and as S. Paule saith, Liue worthie of God:
that is, to speake most plainely, if we did both loue God with our whole heart, and from our verie bowelles, and also, if wee did beare as great good will to our neighbour, as we doe to our selues: if we our selues would doe that to no man, which we would not haue done to vs, if we were such towardes others, as we would other men were towardes vs: finally, if we did helpe, and succour alwayes our neighbour, either with our substance, or with our helping hand, or with our good aduise, and counsell, not regarding euerie man his owne thinges, but the thinges of other men: if we did studie to profite all men, yea euen our enimies, to hurt no man, no not if we be prouoked: lastly, if wee would be terrified from sinne and wickednesse rather with the loue of God than for feare, if we would not loose the bridle to our lustes, if we would doe nothing, which ought not to be done.
doe not measure, and ponder, as it is worthie, the greatnesse of Gods benefits, neither doe we sufficiently consider with our selues how great commodities this doctrine, instaured by God, hath brought a good while agoe vnto Christendome.
in? in how great superstitions were wee nusled in? to what passe was Christian pietie come vnto? was it not come to this point, that it was thought a better, and a more excellent thing for a man to be called a Franciscane, than simply a Christian? that wee did attribute much more to mans rites, than to Gods preceptes? that in obteining saluation we did trust rather to ceremonies, than to the fauour, and mercie of God, or to the merite of Christ? that almost altogether excluding Christ, whose death was a pacification of Gods wrath
against sinne, wee did of our selues seeke to satisfie for our owne sinnes? that wee did not onely iudge that heauen was due to our merites, but also that we did sell our good woorkes of supererogation? Finally, that leauing, and refusing God, euerie man did for him selfe woorshippe, reuerence, adore the idol of his owne hearte? doe omitte, and let passe lighter matters, how that we did both feare vaine apparitions, and shadowes of walking spirites, and also how that wee did feigne, deuise Purgatorie fire out of Virgils Aeneades: how that wee
gaue that seruice and honour to mortall men long since departed, which should haue bene giuen to God onely: how that they whiche were deliuered from the plague, gaue thankes to Saint Roch, they whiche returned safe from battell gaue thankes to Saint George, they which
had escaped shipwrack gaue thankes to Saint Nicholas, they which had gotte good store of riches gaue thankes to can not tell what Saint Erasmus, they whiche had a plentifull, and fruitfull vineyarde gaue thankes to S. Vrban, they which were eased from the torment of toothachegaue thankes to Saint Apolline, they whiche had conceiued borne children without any greate paine, gaue thankes to Saint Margaret.
plainely made Ethnikall, and Heathenish Gods: and as the Gentiles in times past were woont to pray vnto Aesculapius,
and Apollo, for the depulsion, and driuing away of diseases, vnto Mars for victorie, vnto Neptune for a prosperous nauigation, vnto Iuno for riches, vnto Bacchus for plentie of wine, vnto Ceres for abundance of corne, vnto Lucina for an happie childbirth: so wee were woont to begge, and craue the like benefites of them whom wee speake of.
Yea, as amongest the Ethnikes in olde time, euerie citie, or region, had their Gods, whom they did peculiarly woorshippe: for (as the
Cecropia serues as God Minerua wise, and Creete Diana dame, Hipsiphile soile adores the blacksmith Vulcane halt, and lame: But Sparta woorshippes Iunoes grace, Micaena honors Pelops stock, The coastes of Menalis serues that Syluan God which Faunus hight, And eke Lauinia lande doth woorshippe Mars that warlik wight.
So at this day Venice hath her S. Marke, in whose tutelship she stands, Millain hath S. Ambrose, Paris hath S.
Denis, Collin hath the three Kings, or the three Magi, Francia hath S. Chilian, Polonia hath S. Hedeuigis: finally, other haue other Saintes to defend them.
Also euerie seuerall companie, and order of craftes men hath adopted their peculiar patrons, and as it were houshold gods to defend them: as for example: the Goldsmithes
haue got them S. Eulogius, the Shoomakers S. Crispin, the Fullers S. Seuerus, the Painters S. Luke, the Physicians S. Cosma S. Damian, the Lawyers S. Fuon, the Students of artes and liberall sciences S. Catharine.
If wee would repeate call to minde these, other superstitions almost innumerable, we should now the more easily measure after a sort in our minde the magnitude, greatnesse of Gods benefite: especially if wee did remember
that as yet there are euerie where verie many countries which are ouerwhelmed in most thicke darknesse of errours ignorance, not differing at all from those nations, which in times past were wholy giuen ouer to the worshipping of idols: as well nigh all those people be at this day, which with so great clamours, outcries, call for that state of religio~ againe, which they vaunt to haue profited so long the Christian common weale: who desire that the ceremonies of their fathers may be worshipped:
which woulde haue the Emperour bring this to passe, that looke what religion they receiued when they were children, the same being old men they should leaue to their posteritie: to be briefe, who had rather embrace obserue the institutions traditions of their Elders, old customes, mens prescriptes, than the rites of the Apostles, than the veritie of the Gospell, than the co~mandements of God: amongst whom the Lombardicall historie is of more authoritie, than the sacred scripture: the Decretals, than the Gospels, the Bishop of Rome, than the sonne of God Christ Iesus.
are we bound to God for instauring the doctrine of the Gospell in this our age? What thanks ought we to giue, render vnto him? How greatly ought we to take heede, bew are that we doe not by chaunce any thing vnwittingly, which might offend the authour of this benefite? What great care ought we to haue alwayes to labour, trauell about those things, which are gratefull, and acceptable to God, who loueth vs so entirely.
But how thankfull to God the common people are for
this benefite, alas, it appeareth too plainly, euidently at this day.
For the greater part of those men, who would be accounted Christians (without enuie be it spoken) is giuen to gluttonie, to surfeting, to all kind of wickednes, the maior part, say, liueth nicely, delicately, riotously, the greater number is carried headlong into all kind of pleasure, intemperancie, they loue, they drinke apace, they runne a whore hunting, they snatch catch, they filch steale, they sweare, forsweare, they cogge and lie, they defraude, and deceiue: in summe, whatsoeuer ought not to be done, that they doe.

Kinges courtes dronkennesse ruleth and reigneth: and now to liue there is naught else, but to vie drinking
In Noble mens gorgious buildings, and goodlie houses, nothing else almost (by their leaues) is done, but daily diceplaying, iollie tossing of beere potts, daunsing to the sound of the Citterne, or Lute.
let passe how that some of these Noble me~ haue turned those possessions, whiche by the liberalitie of their auncestours were left to the Church, into their owne vse, and suffer the miserable Pastours of the Church to dy almost for hunger: so farre are they off from helping and releeuing them as much as in them lieth.
This verely is our gratitude, and thankfulnesse towardes that singular, and notable benefite of God, which he bestowed vpon vs, in taking away from among vs superstitions, and in instauring holie and sacred doctrine.
No man truely can either declare in woorde, or shadowe out in thought, how excellent, and how great this benefite of God is.
For now at the length we haue learned whiche is the holie, Catholike, Apostolicall, orthodox, and true
Christian Church: and what that communion of Saints is, whereunto they must ioyne them selues in faith, in will, in opinion, in prayer, and in confession, whosoeuer will be members of the people of God, and of that mysticall bodie (whereof Christ is the head) in what parte of the world soeuer they liue in.
that thing, whiche almost no man heeretofore knew, namely that all me~ are saued by Christ alone, no man by his owne merites: that all men obteine saluation, and eternall felicitie through the Mediatour the sonne of God, not for the dignitie of their woorkes: by whiche
meanes verely both the Patriarches, and also the Prophetes, the people of Israel, and finally all the godlie, which haue bene from the creation of the world vnto this day, haue bene saued.
come to bee the deliuerer of mankinde, was promised from the beginning.
Wherevppon in the Reuelation there is that mention of the Lambe, whiche was slaine from the originall of the worlde.
or Euangell, that is to say, that forgiuenesse of sinnes reuealed, and promised from heauen, by the free goodnesse of GOD for the deliuerer to come, hath bene alwayes euen from the verie beginning of mankinde, though not yet in name, and in woord, yet in deed, and in truth.
For this redeemer Christ is that seede of the woman promised vnto Adam, which shoulde breake the serpentes heade, that is, which
shoulde destroy the woorkes of the Diuell, to witte, sinne and death.
Hee is the seede of Abraham, in which seede all the nations of the earth shoulde bee
Hee is the sonne of Dauid, who shoulde reigne ouer the house of Iacob foreuer.
This is hee whiche was shadowed by the Leuiticall sacrifices, and foretolde by the oracles of the Prophetes.
Therefore wee haue all the godlie, which haue bene euen from the beginning of the worlde, ioyned with vs in the profession of the same faith.
For looke in whome the Patriarches, the Prophetes, and the people of Israel placed all their confidence, in the Messias promised to them: in the very same Christ nowe exhibited vnto vs, both Apostles, Martyres, Confessours: and finally, wee all put our hope of saluation.
learned out of this doctrine renewed: this is that communion of Saintes, which, being (as saide before) euen from the beginning of the worlde, after the promise concerning the deliuerer to come, was first propagated, and continued in the Patriarches, and Prophetes,
afterwardes in the Apostles, Martyrs, so on continueth, perseuereth vnto this day by diuerse degrees, orders of Christians, professing the same faith, perfourming, shewing obedience to the Ministers of the Church.
The sonne of God our Lord, and Sauiour Iesus Christ doeth, by his woord, and Gospell gouerne,
and by his holy Spirit helpe, and assist this Church, and this communion of Saintes.
thrice happie, and foure times blessed are they, whiche ioyne them selues vnto the societie of this Church, whiche hath the sonne of
GOD for her President, the Angels for her protectours, the holy Ghost for her sanctifier: finally, all the godlie, and electe of all ages, as many as are ordeined to eternall life, for her fellowes, and companions.
In this Church thou shalt finde Adam, Noah, Melchisedech, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Moses, Samuel, Dauid, Esaie, Daniel, to bee short, all the Patriarches, Prophets, Apostles, Martyres, virgins, confessours, and the holy Angels of God mixed among all these.
Who would not exclame, and cry out with the Prophet? howe amiable are thy Tabernacles, Lorde of hostes? My soule
fainteth, and consumeth away, through the desire of thine house.
Blessed are they whiche dwell in thine house, Lord, whiche extoll thee with perpetuall praises.
Blessed is hee, Lorde, whiche putteth his trust in thee.
Howe greately, pray you, doe thinke that other men are moued with these thinges? Doe doate, and am rauished out of measure with the mention of these thinges? Or are other men also throughly touched with the like feeling that am?
Surely my selfe, as often as am conuersant in the cogitation, and remembraunce of these thinges, conceiue in my minde an incredible pleasure, and as the Poet saith, Secreat ioyes doe creepe into my silent breast.
and refresh mee, as that communion of Saintes, and that one, and the same faith, euen from the last originall of the worlde, of all Patriarches, Prophets, and of the people of Israel, and of ours at this day in Christ, promised indeed to them, but now alreadie exhibited, and giuen to vs: and that most blessed companie hereafter, with all the Saintes in the celestiall kingdome, vnto whiche aspire with a feruent desire, whiche nowe also mee thinkes enioy, and receiue well nigh a certeine tast of the future felicitie, and happinesse in Heauen: and also the Capteine him selfe and heade of this Church, our Lorde, and Redeemer Iesus Christ, doeth after a maruellous manner moue mee,
delight me, and well nigh bring mee into a traunce besides my selfe, when thinke vppon him.
For streightway it comes into my mind, that this specified Christ is hee, in whome to come all the Saintes from the beginning haue fixed, and placed all their trust, and confidence: that this is hee, to whome all the Prophetes
giue witnesse, that through his name all that beleeue in him, and put the hope of their saluation in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes: that this is hee who came into the worlde to saue sinners, to seeke,
and to saue that whiche was lost, and like to perish, to giue his soule for the redemption, and raunsome of manie: that this is hee who was sent to preach the Gospell to the poore, to heale the broken hearted, to preache deliueraunce to the captiues,
to comforte them that mourne, to sette at libertie them that are oppressed: that this is he, whome therefore the Father sent, not that hee might condemne the worlde, but that the worlde might
bee saued by him: that this is hee, for whome
the heauenlie father hath forgiuen vs all our trespasses, putting out the obligation, or hand writing, which was
against vs: yea, taking it quite out away, and fastening it vpon his crosse: that this is he who commaundeth all that labour, and are heauie laden, to come vnto him: and which promiseth to ease, and refresh them: that this is he which died for our saluation, who by his bloud satisfied
God for the sinnes of mankind, and who hath by his passion suffered the punishment, which we did owe
vnto the iustice of God: who being persuaded therevnto through exceeding loue towardes vs, gaue himselfe
for vs an oblation, and sacrifice to God of a sweete smelling fauour: that this is he which hath deliuered vs from the Diuell, from sinne, and from eternall death.
Who by his death hath abolished and destroyed him, which had the rule, and imperie ouer death, to witte, the Diuell: who hath redeemed vs from the curse of
the lawe, hee him selfe beeing made a curse for vs: that this is hee, who hath ouercome Satan by his crosse, and hath triumphed ouer the conquered, who hath beseeged and battered downe hell, and hath
made an entrie, and passage into heauen: who ascending vp on high, hath led captiuitie captiue: that this is hee, who sitting at the right hande of GOD the father, doeth perpetually make intercession for vs, who being our Proctour and Aduocate, we may easily obteine at our heauenlie fathers hands, pardon, forgiuenesse of sinnes, that this is he, in whome onely wee haue recouered that whiche wee had lost in our first father Adam, namely, to bee created according to the image, and similitude of GOD: that is, (as Saint Paule interpreteth it) after righteousnesse, and true holinesse:
by whome we are adopted of the heauenlie father into the number of the sonnes of God, to become partakers as of his name, so also of his kingdome,
that he is the Mediatour, Interpreter, and Pacificatour betwixt God, and men, that he is the throne of grace,
our Bishop, and high Priest, to entreate daily for vs, the propitiation for the sinnes of the world, the Lambe of
God, which taketh away the sinnes of the worlde, the Pastour, sheepheard of our soules, our hope, our life, our resurrection, moreouer our wisedome, our righteousnesse,
and our sanctification, and our redemption: that this is he in Esaie, vpon whom the Lorde hath laid the iniquities of vs all, and by whose woundes we are healed: that he is that victour, and conquerour of death and of hell in Oseas: that he is that Lorde our iustifier,
in Ieremie: to be short, and not tedious, that he is that Emmanuel, father of eternall life, Prince of peace, that sonne of righteousnesse, that light, and lampe of the Gentiles: in summe, that this is he whom the old auncient rites, and Leuiticall ceremonies shadowed, prefigured,
to whom the whole lawe of Moses had respect, and regarde, whom the Prophetes, and the vniuersall scripture haue proponed vnto them, as the onely marke to shoote at.
Wherefore the remembrance of all these things being such, and so great, as they are, doth (as said before) incredibly moue me, and doeth maruellously delight me, yea by thinking vppon these thinges doe tast as it were a certeine sense, and feeling of the future felicitie, and happinesse in heauen.
day inculcated, and beaten continually into the eares, minds of all men, surely all men ought to be merrie, and glad, at the mention of these thinges, and all men ought to giue thankes to God for this doctrine instaured, and to declare the thankefulnesse of their mindes not onely by singing of Psalmes, Hymnes, and spirituall songes:
but also by leading a life after the will, and imitation of God: and chiefly they must endeuoure, and trauell, to growe in grace, in the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, as S. Peter warneth vs, and that daily
they profite more more in it, or (as S. Paule speaketh) abounde more euerie day than other in it.
But, the execrable and abhominable negligence of men, in repeating,
and calling to minde Gods benefites, in rendering due, and deserued thankes to so gratious, and bountifull a God.
For wee liue so, that wee differ nothing at all from Epicures, that the name of God is for our sakes contumeliously reproched, and euill spoken of amongst the Turkes: that wee doe alienate all men from religion, vnto which wee ought, by our honest manners, and good conuersation to inuite, and to allure all men.
And in the meane season, whilest we liue so, wee both greeue the holie Spirit, and cause that wicked, and vncleane spirit, to reioyce at vs: and also wee yeeld our selues (whom Christ hath redeemed by his bloud) voluntarily to the bondage, seruitude, and slauerie of Sathan: wee, whom Christ hath deliuered from our sinnes, doe wittingly, willingly rush headlong againe into sinne: wee, whom he hath made heires of the heauenlie kingdome, doe cause our selues through our owne fault to be disinherited.
This verely is all the thankes that wee giue vnto GOD for this doctrine of the Gospell renewed, this is the thankes wee giue vnto Christ for giuing vs saluation, so wee giue our selues to bee ruled, and gouerned by the holie Ghost.
With these deedes wee approche, and drawe neere vnto the Lordes Table.
So doe wee expect, and waite for the comming of Christ, And, for ought that see, death is like to attache vs
so doing, so wee are like to come vnto Gods iudgement seate.
But, that may returne to my purpose, truely my selfe thinking, and musing with my selfe vppon Christ, (whom wee beginne to confesse, and acknowledge truely by this doctrine instaured,) am incredibly moued, and affected: neither is there any thing, whereby
doe receiue either greater comfort, or greater pleasure, than by the remembraunce of Christes benefites, and of the good will of our heauenlie father towardes vs, who hath so loued the worlde, that he hath preferred our saluation before the loue of his onelie sonne.
And falling into this cogitation, can not temper, and refraine my selfe, but must needes exclame, and crie out, sundrie times with Saint Paule: If God be on our side for vs, who can be against vs? Hee that spared
not his owne sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death, howe shall he not with him giue vs all thinges also? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods chosen? It is God that iustifieth, who shall condemne? It is Christ which is dead, yea or rather, which is risen againe, who is also at the right hand of GOD, and maketh request also for vs. yea, and in this cogitation of Christ there is nothing at all, which may dismay
and discomfort a conscience laden with greeuous sinnes, much lesse driue it to desperation.
For if the lawe being broken, and transgressed, doeth woorke a feare, terrour in vs, let vs remember that Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the lawe: if sinne terrifie vs, let vs remember that the bloud of Christ hath cleansed
vs from all sinne: if death daunt vs, let vs remember that Christ is the life, and the resurrection: if the wrath iudgement of God amaze vs, let vs remember
that we are reconciled to God by Christ: if Sathan assault vs, let vs remember that Christ hath triumphed ouer
him, being vanquished, and subdued: if hell fire make vs affraied, let vs remember that Christ, hauing beaten downe hell, hath giuen vs an entrie into heauen.
In such terrours, and in such a tast and feeling of eternall
death, you should in old time haue sought for this consolation in vaine in the Popes kingdome.
For that was nothing but mans satisfaction, Romish indulgencies, and the communion of Monasticall woorkes bought both with suite, and with siluer, the sacrifice of the Masse, Pilgrimages to holie places, and such other like trifles were opposed, and set against sinnes, and against death euerlasting.
The habit, and weede of a Franciscane Frier, and that staffe of reede, that is, that help of their seruice for the dead, that helpe of memories, of anniuersaries, of oblations, of nightwatchers, as were set against Sathan, and hell fire.
this end and purpose, that it may the better be vnderstood, how deepely we are indebted vnto our heauenlie father for this renouation of Ecclesiasticall doctrine, that by this meanes we may be the more excited, and stirred vp, to pay with mindfull hearts deserued thankes to God so bountifull, and so benigne vnto vs.
For vnlesse thou doest often call to minde with thy selfe, what great blindnesse there hath bene heretofore in Christendome, howe grosse darknesse, and thicke cloudes of errours and ignorance: vnlesse thou by diligent cogitation and consideration doest often remember the superstition of the former age, surely thou shalt neuer vnderstand how great commoditie the instauration of holie doctrine hath brought vnto vs.
part of gratitude, or thankfulnesse, to repeate in memorie the euilles passed, from whence thou art deliuered,
that so thou maist the better ponder, and also weigh the greatnesse of the benefite, that so thou maist consider well what good thing thou hast receiued, that so thou maist commend, and praise that same benefite with a gratefull commemoration, and that so thou maist offer alwayes to God through Christ the sacrifice of praise: that is, that so thou maist with thy whole heart giue thankes to Gods goodnesse, and that thou maist pay thy vowes vnto the Lorde before all his people, as the Psalmist saith.
For God requireth of vs this sacrifice called [undefined span alphabet], or a sacrifice of thankesgiuing.
And if the Ethnikes, and Panims in olde time, when any thing had fallen out fortunately, and luckily amongst them, were woont to declare their grateful good will towards the gods, by appointing solemne Processions, and supplications to be said about all the temples, and tabernacles of their gods, or by offering vp sacrifices vnto them: how much rather ought we to see to this, in this renouation of the doctrine of the Church (than which there could no greater benefite haue bene giuen vnto vs) that we be mindfull, and thankefull, and that we declare, and witnesse to the world this our thankfulnesse, by celebrating the praises of God continually, by singing hymnes to God both with our selues at home, and
also in the congregation, and companie of the godlie abroade, by assisting, and succouring the Ministers of the worde, by godlinesse, and holinesse of life, by doing our dueties towardes our neighbour, by suffering aduersitie patiently: finally, by what meanes soeuer wee can.
And surely, in this instauration of the doctrine of the Church, we may almost feele with our verie handes, (that may so speake) the goodnesse of God towardes vs.
The diligent consideration of which thing ought worthily to stirre vs vp (as said before) to giue thankes to God for so great bountie, and benignitie: who hath
called vs againe vnto the way of trueth, when we were wrapped in so many errours, who hath conuerted vs
from vnpure superstition to sincere religion, and pietie, who hath reuealed his mysteries, which lay hid many ages, and who hath disclosed the secretes of his will, who hath brought vs vnto the true knowledge of the sonne of God, in which knowledge mannes saluation consisteth: of whom wee neither had a right opinion, neither did wee knowe what a safegard, and succour wee had in him: who dispelling, and beating away all foggie mistes of ignorance, in which wee were, hath restored vnto vs the light of his Gospell, as the Sunne being taken from the earth: lastly, who hath taught vs to call vppon him truely, to worshippe, and serue him sincerely, and who hath permitted vs, being conuerted vnto him, to see, and behold his glorie (as Dauid saith in the Psalmes) which we could not see before, being blinded with superstition, and with the worship of dead men.
will make an end, after shall haue added one certeine thing.
haue spoken, and entreated hitherto, of the felicitie, or happinesse of this our age, and nowe a great while haue vttered foorth many wordes of this matter.
But some man will say vnto mee: Doe we not see, that after this renouation of celestiall doctrine, God hath afflicted the world with so many, and so great calamities?
As for example sake, with force and rage of tempestes, with casualties by fire, by lighteninges, with scarsitie or dearth of victualles, with penurie of all thinges, with hunger and famine, with the plague, and pestilence, also with diseases so straunge, that their verie names are vnknowen of the Physicians, with destructions and deuastations, with earthquakes, with deluges or floudes of water, with incursions of wilde beastes, with annoyance of locustes, and chiefly with
so many, so long, so cruell, so pestiferous, so miserable, so deadlie, and dolefull warres: yea, and the same most commonly ciuil warres: whereby it comes to
passe, that Germanie doeth destroy her selfe with her owne strength.
both of these, and other euils, to the religion now instaured.
that the cause of the plague, which reigned and raged so long in his time, was the worshipping of Christ, because that Aesculapius; and the rest of their gods, which
would haue succoured them, were neglected: so at this day, these men, what harme or ill soeuer happen publikely, doe attribute it to the doctrine nowe renewed, and reuiued, for that the Masse, and old auncient ceremonies, which might appease Gods ire, and which might turne away all euilles from vs, were refused and reiected.
cause of all common casualties, and mischances, vppon the enuie of the Christians, and they thought, that the Christians were the cause of all publike destructions, and of all discommodities, which befell to the common people, as Tertullian saith: Si Tybris (inquit) ascendit in maenia, si Nilus non ascendit in arua, si coelum stetit, si terra mouit, si fames, si lues, statim, Christianus ad leonem, acclamatur.
Oro vos ante Tiberium, id est, ante Christi aduentum, quantae clades orbem vrbem caeciderunt, &c.
That is to say, If Tyber (saith he) runne and flowe ouer the walles, if Nilus doeth not ouerflowe and water the fieldes, if the heauens haue stoode still, if the earth hath moued, if famine, if pestilence, haue come amongst men, they crie out streightway: Away with the Christians: haue them hence to the Lions.
beseeche you before Tiberius, that is, before the comming of Christ, what great destructions, and calamities, fell vpon both the whole world, and also vpon the citie of Rome it selfe? &c. Wee will heere bring in nothing concerning the causes why God doth afflict the world, with so many, and sundrie calamities: for the tractatition, and handling of that matter, doeth not perteine properly to this argument, which we haue in hand.
are no lette, and impediment, why this our age should bee lesse happie for the renouation of the heauenlie doctrine.
For, if wee will iudge aright, and truely, the benefite which God bestowed vppon vs, in the restitution of the Gospell, it is so great, that looke what calamitie soeuer chaunceth, it is easily ouerwhelmed with the greatnesse of the benefite, and it scarse appeareth, especially amongst them, which haue any care, and regarde of their owne saluation.
For these men, because they knowe assuredly, that this is life euerlasting, that wee acknowledge the true GOD, and Iesus Christ, whom he hath sent, they esteeme
so much this notice, and knowledge of the true God, and of his sonne Iesus Christ, that in comparison of this one thing, they set naught by all humane, and earthlie thinges, whether they be good, or bad.
And seeing that they are throughly persuaded to haue God friendlie, and fauourable vnto them for Christes sake, they doe easily contemne, and despise all other things, they doe easily suffer all aduersitie, miserie: yea, they do not feare, dread no not death it selfe.
They knowe that their sinnes are pardoned, and forgiuen them for Christ, that they are reconciled vnto God, that they are adopted to be the sonnes of God,
that the inheritaunce of eternall life is promised vnto them, they haue learned to call vpon God truely, and vnfeignedly.
These thinges they so much esteeme, and make so greate account of, that whatsoeuer befalles to them, they beare it patiently, and with a quiet minde: yea, though the brused world should slide, and fall, and ruines rush vppon their heades vnwares, as the Poet saith, yet they would not bee affraide or dismaide awhit.
They well remember that they haue no stedfast seate, nor sure dwelling place in earth, but that they are here in exile, and banishment, and that they liue heere as Pilgrims, and straungers.
Therefore they alwayes sigh deepely, and desire feruently, that eternall and celestiall
countrie, and they vse this worlde, as though they vsed it not, as the Apostle teacheth vs to doe.
that death is not the finall end of life, but a beginning of blessed immortalitie, and a passage out of this world vnto the father.
with S. Paule to bee dissolued, and also with Simeon to departe hence in peace.
In the meane space, whatsoeuer happeneth, they suffer it stoutely, and with a good courage.
They put all their hope and trust in Christ alone.
Neither for all that, are the godlie no whit moued, either with publike euilles,
or priuate calamities (for they ca~ not put off the nature of man, and they can not refuse the common sense of nature:) but they doe iudge, that our sinnes haue deserued them, and they reckon that in respect, and consideration of Gods will, all thinges are to be suffered of vs.
They doe beleeue, that by this meanes they are prouoked vnto repentance, that they are pricked forward to prayer, to request Gods ayde and assistance.
Therefore they studie to exercise both ther faith in prayer: and inuocation, and also their patience in tolerating, and suffering
For they are persuaded, that calamities come not vpon men by chance, but that they are sent of God.
doubted, but that these are punishmentes for the sinnes of mankinde.
And our men haue learned out of this renewed doctrine, that both priuate miseries, and afflictions, and also publike calamities, are after
a sorte the voyce of the Lawe, whiche stirreth men vp to the remembraunce of GODS wrath against sinners, and whiche exhorteth them vnto repentance.
For, because the Sermons, whiche are preached in the Church, concerning GODS iudgement, doe not greately moue the obstinate, and stifnecked persons, therefore GOD would that both publike,
and priuate calamities shoulde preache vnto vs of repentaunce, that so wee might studie to acknowledge our sinnes, and lament, and bee sorie for them: For looke what Iohn Baptist in Saint Matthaewes Gospell,
and our Sauiour Christ in Saint Markes Gospell saith, Repent, and amend: the very same doe all kinde of calamities seeme to cry foorth openly, to witte, that wee should repent, to the end wee may not onely shunne, and escape the temporall punishmentes of this life, but also bee deliuered from eternall punishment in hell.
So that, looke what the Lawe of GOD coulde not doe in woordes, that doeth God labour to obteine by sending calamities.
And the greatenesse of GODS wrath against sinne, which no man can expresse, as it is woorthie, by any force of speeche: that calamities are woont to shadowe out after a sorte vnto vs, how greate it is.
Seeing therefore, as haue shewed alreadie, what ill soeuer doeth happen
priuately, or publikely, as warre, famine, plague, that is a signe, and testimonie of Gods greate wrath against our sinnes, and seeing that no man doeth easily
feele the greatnesse of his wrath, such is mans dulnesse, and blockishnesse, vnlesse GOD by this meanes stirre vs vp, and admonish vs: the godlie doe not onely
suffer patiently, and with a ioyfull minde, what aduersities soeuer happen vnto them: but also they giue thankes to their most gratious father so inuiting them to the amendement of their life, they acknowledge and confesse their sinnes, they flee vnto Gods clemencie as humble oratours, and in their oraisons, or prayers, they first aske forgiuenesse, and pardon of their sinnes: secondly, they craue begge of God, that those euilles may bee mitigated, and lenefied.
In the one they bequeath, and committe them selues vnto Gods goodnesse: in the other they permit, and suffer him to deale with them according to his good will, and pleasure, being namely readie prepared both to doe, and to suffer, whatsoeuer shall seeme good vnto God.
They cry out in the sense, and feeling of Gods wrath with Dauid: Lord in thine indignation rebuke vs not, neither chastise
vs in thy heauie displeasure: with Esaie, Lord bee not sore an angred with vs, neither remember our iniquities perpetually: with Ieremie, Chastise vs, Lord, in thy iudgement· not in thy furie, lest thou bring vs to
nothing: with Abaccuch, Lorde in thine anger remember thy mercie.
The manifold calamities whiche befall, doe not hinder (as saide before) why that this our age may not be passing happie.
Yea, the godlie, whome this instaured doctrine of the Church hath excited, and stirred vp, to the true and sincere woorshippe of GOD, whome it hath brought vnto the acknowledging of the sonne of GOD our Lorde, and Sauiour Iesus Christ, driuing away all darkenesse of former times, and vnto whome it hath shewed the right way, not onely of leading a life heere with ioy, but also of departing
hence out of this life with good hope, the godlie say doe set so much by this benefite giuen of God, that the sorrowe, and griefe, whiche calamities doe cause, is easily ouerwhelmed with that ioy, and pleasure,
And as commonly all thinges woorke together for the best, to them whiche loue God, as S. Paule testifieth: so afflictions, miseries, and calamities, doe after a sorte profite the godlie to their saluation, and doe fall out for the
best, to witte, whilest they being stirred vp to the remembrance of their sinnes, and feeling the wrath of God, doe repent, doe humbly aske forgiuenesse, doe request Gods helpe, and assistance, doe exercise their faith by prayer, and their patience by suffering aduersities: whilest by that meanes that greeuous dead sleepe, that faintenesse, and that too much securitie, which in prosperitie possesseth mens mindes, is shaken off, whilest so the sluggish, and slouthfull minde of man is awakened, and quickened with the feare of God, and whilest by that meanes it is inflamed with the loue, and desire of celestiall thinges.
grieued to see them selues afflicted with many miseries, but also they account it a greate benefite, because they are chastened of God wholesomely, and after a fatherlie fashion, and what casualtie soeuer GOD bringeth vpon them, they suffer it manfully, and with a ioyfull minde.
will not heere adde, how that at all times, and in all ages there were certeine fatall (as it were) calamities of mankinde, and certeine punishmentes of the world, left that any man should thinke, that some new thing had happened to this our age, or least that any man should defame these present times (that may vse the woordes of Orosius) as more infested, and annoyed with mischances,
and ill happes, than other times were woont to haue bene, because of this heauenlie doctrine renewed,
because we beleeue in Christ, acknowledge him to be the author of mans saluation, because now God is most truely woorshipped in spirit trueth.
For as in our time, so there haue ben in all ages past, many times, which haue bene either greeuous by reason of warres, or corrupt with diseases, or sorowfull for famine, or terrible for erthquakes, or strange times for innundations greate floudes of waters, or fearefull for breaking out of fire, or cruell for blastinges, thunderboltes, lightninges, for boysterous blowes of hailestones, or else (as the same Orosius saith) miserable times for murders of father and mother, and for all heinous villanies, wickednesse that can bee: which thing the Chronicles, Histories, and monumentes of antiquitie doe testifie.
Christ, who is to bee praised for euer, graunt for his vnmesurable, infinite mercie, and for his maruellous bountie and benignitie towardes mankinde, that wee may both acknowledge the felicitie, and happinesse of this age, and also that wee may bee most thankfully minded for that celestiall benefite, in restoring to vs the doctrine of the Gospell, than the which benefite there could not haue bene giuen a greater to men on earth: that wee may studie to professe openly Iesus Christ, to celebrate him with perpetuall praises, Psalmes, hymnes, to worshippe him, to call vppon him, to adore him, whome wee haue begonne to acknowledge: that wee may expect in a firme faith and stedfast hope, and looke for life, for saluation, for immortalitie, replenished with all good thinges, by the same Christ only: that wee may desire to please him alone, to approue our selues to him by leading our life according to his will, after his imitation, as S. Paule speaketh, by walking woorthie of God, worthie of the Gospell of Christ: that we may yelde
afflictions, that we may beleeue, that this also is some parte of gratitude, or thankfulnesse: to bee briefe, that wee may alwayes goe about those thinges, which perteine chiefly to his glorie, to the saluation of the Church, to the profite and commoditie of the Christian common wealth: moreouer, that wee may all of vs mutually amongst our selues bee of one, and the same minde according to Iesus Christ, that with one accord, with one mouth we may glorifie God, euen the father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that we may all speake the same
thing, that there be not dissentions, and schismes among vs, but that wee bee an whole bodie, being of one mind, of one iudgement, as the Apostle S. Paule warneth vs. These thinges graunt he who is the Author,
founteine of all goodnesse, God most gratious, most mightie, the Father, the Sonne, the holie Ghost, one infinite, eternall, omnipotent God Lorde: whose both vnitie in trinitie, and also trinitie in vnitie we reuerence, worshippe, and adore.
To whom be praise, honour, and glorie, world without end: Amen.
This is the condemnation, that light is come into the worlde, and men loue darkenesse rather than light; because their deedes are euill.
If the Gospell be now hid, it is hid to them that perish, whose mindes the God of this worlde hath blinded, that the light of the glorious Gospell of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine vnto them.

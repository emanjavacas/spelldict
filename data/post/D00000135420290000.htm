the work of god in a dying maid

friends and people to whom these following lines may come these may give you knowledge that being spoken unto by a friend of the state of sickness and wonderful expressions that were uttered by this maid now deceased made me desirous to see her and as a mother fearing god knowing what joy it must be to have a child that had transgressed to turn to the lord with all the heart and to find acceptance with

the almighty as have cause to believe she did for he was with her and felt a living power to opperate in her that neither her youth nor comliness with any other outward expectation that she formerly had or might have of the glory of this world left a place in her to desire any longer life in this world but as she had before came cryed out against her self for loving and going to these vanities and parish places of worship so now in my hearing she was much raised in her spirit in the sense of the joy that she believed she was entring into praying and praising the lord with a pleasant melody and desiring also that her mother might be taken out of this wicked world felt the of god unto her and she was brought near to me the lord shewed me she must dye and being

the only child of her parents and having heard this mother had buried her only son not a quarter of a year before which by relation was an excellent child for his years not being six and an half for wisdom and learning and outward comliness a very beautiful child and one of a great courage yet of a very tender sweet loving nature and more than all in soberness pursuing of the better part so felt and know in these sudden and renewing trials there was judgment and beholding her mother's quiet and patient bearing of it had this brought to my remembrance that they are blessed that can stand in judgment and none but a tender mother can tell what it is to have hopeful children so soon taken from them and fee the lord is righteous in what he doth and that have drunk into

this cup and a more bitter one must confess the lord is righteous in all and his judgments are true but his mercies are over all his works and his love everlasting and who lives therein gives thanks for all things and this appears to me worthy to be known and retained that so young a hopeful and beautiful maid should be taken off from her vanity yet that the mercy of the lord should so freely extend it self unto her that she might testifie against her own and the world's vanities and worships and tho but in the last hour the lord of goodness granted her an entrance into his vineyard and power she received to magnifie his justice and mercy that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings will perfect his own praise and sure am the dealings of the almighty god with her on her was forewarning

some and instruction to others that all might believe and come to the obedience of the life where all may profit and be built up unto eternal life over death and hell in the life of jesus our lord which is the desire of her that through grace is a lover of all your souls called

svsanna whitrow sickned the day of the month
and lay until the day under great judgment and terrors of the lord for sin and iniquity and about four in the afternoon she broke forth in exceeding earnestness crying to the lord for mercy with wonderful words till about three hours then did the lord hear her cries and answered the desire of her soul and when she had obtained

mercy from the lord then did she fall into an exceeding travil in soul and spirit praying mightily to the lord in the behalf of her father and so lay four or five hours crying earnestly to the lord for her father before we writ down any of her words
her natural spirits were almost spent before these words were taken as follow

lord remember not his offences let me bear them lord let it be easie to him lord make the way easie make his friends to be enemies unto him that thou mayst have mercy on him lord his temptations are great lord carry him through let him not perish with the world lord do thou support him over this world should a little silly dirt of this world draw away his mind lord satisfie me whether thou wilt grant me my desires blessed

sarah ellis her testimony concerning susanna whitrow to her mother
a few words which were expressed by this precious child in the time of her illness

not thinking she was so near her end did not bear in memory as many of her words as might have done can truly say

was much refreshed in seeing the great work and power of the lord upon her and hearing the precious words that proceeded out of her mouth when first came to see her she had lain about a weekill she seemed to be in much extremity of pain and crying out to the lord saying lord the enemy has wounded my heart he has wounded my head and he has wounded my hell come lord make room make room my heart is open rip me up and set me in thy bosome as thou didst the last night feel the enemy coming in like a flood lord drive him out

another time went to visit her when she was in great conflict of spirit and body and her mother withdrew from her to seek the lord leaving her father by her in which time she uttered little or nothing but lay

groaning she would hardly suffer her mother to be from her if she could help it after a while her mother came again and she said mother cease not cease not though no one had told her that her mother was a praying to the lord but only as she had a sence of it in her self and when her mother came to her again she was in a sweet still frame of spirit and cryed out ah my dear mother my blessed mother the lord has shewed me my mother shall have a double portion of his spirit yea my mother shall have a double portion
this she spoke several times over with many more precious words that are past out of my mind

another time came to see her a day or two before she dyed and her countenance was changed and she looked very sweetly and lay praising the lord saying oh my

saviour my blessed saviour

another time her mother went out of the room· in to the next room about some business and she called earnestly to her mother and said ah mother had much in my heart to have spoke to thee care not for this world a little will serve us we shall not want the lord will feed his people as he did elisha by the ravens yea the lord will feed us as he did elisha

sarah ellis

concerning that false report that was raised by some envious persons which she formerly kept company with hearing of her change from that vain conversation she had formerly lived in they reported that she was in love and that that was the cause of her distemper
when her father came home and had given me a relation

of what those persons had infused into him although was satisfied to the contrary went to my dear child and examined her concerning it and because would be clear of might happen hereafter concerning it said unto her my dear child thy father and will give our consent freely for thee to marry him and we will do to the uttermost of our power for thee to make thy life comfortable with him all thy days· then she said

my dear mother thank you but that man is no more to me than one never saw with my eyes neither will ever him if he had all the possessions of the earth it's true there was something betwixt us he being very urgent with me upon the account of marriage proffering to settle a considerable estate on me and my father at that time being a little harsh to

me thought would set my self at liberty but upon better consideration told him would do nothing without my father and mother's advice which he was unwilling to in that and some other things was considered if should have him should be ruined so that small affection had to him withdrew and before fell sick this last time did desire never to see him more and now my mother am clear of him and all men living

oh my bowed down and mother what hath been thy sufferings in this family oh how hast thou been oppressed with our iniquities ah bowed down ah how often hast thou told my father the lord would visit him with sore and grievous judgment if he did not repent and

turn from the evil of his ways ah how often hast thou said the lord would plead thy righteous cause with us now the day is come thou hast so long warned us of now the lord is risen now the lord is broke in upon us
oh how great hath been thy care and pains which thou hast taken to bring us into the fear of the lord oh thou blessed of the lord great shall be thy reward the lord will give thee beauty for ashes and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness bleffed be thou my mother

her mother being at that time praising and magnifying the lord then she said my blessed mother now is that vision fulfiled which the lord shewed thee concerning me that my soul should bless thee and thy soul should bless the lord

then she broke forth into sweet melody singing praises unto the lord

blessed are the poor in spirit lord am poor am needy need thy strength continually to withstand the temper
lord stand by me move not from me for if thou go the tempter will come will hold the fast thou art my saviour thou shalt save me from the tempter
my dear mother send for that dear friend meaning that prayed by me the other day she is a precious woman her heart is upright before the lord the lord hath shewed it me love her let her pray by me to the lord against the tempter and send for that faithful servant of the lord
the lord will hear the prayers of the faithful but have been unfaithful
how often have sinned against my saviour the light in my conscience which shewed me the way should walk

in how often hath he knocked at my stony heart saying this is my blessed truth which the quakers preach by which all souls that have made shall be saved in then have said in my heart after such a thing and such a thing is accomplished will leave off my life of vanity and become a new creature
oh was she that trusted in lying vanities thought should have had long life and then did intend to serve the lord in my old age

oh how have been against a woman's speaking in a meeting but now whether it comes from man woman or child it is precious indeed
that could be with my mother the lord is with her that might have a little time longer that my dear mother and might go in the country and walk

in a wood together that we might seek the lord and never lay our eyes till we have found him

witnessed by me ann martin

lord my strength faileth wait upon thee renew my strength my holy lord be pleased to restore me to my former health then will wait diligently upon thee will sit on the ground with my head in the dunghil will never lift up my soul to vanity my heart shall never go after the sight of my eyes
my dear mother pray for me for whatsoever thou askest of the lord it shall be given thee

my dear mother thou often hast told us of the terrible and dreadful day of the lord god that

is at hand it will be a dreadful day to the wicked of all sorts the lord hath shewed it me wo wo wo to the children of scoffers for as it· was in elisha day so shall it be in this the day of the lord's power the bears out of the wood shall devour them

and treambling she said

feel thy terrible power god strike dread terror and astonishment in the hearts of thy enemies in all workers of iniquity who make a mock at sin and a derision of thy people and take pleasure in their abominable ways which thou abhorrest thou wilt make all flesh tremble
my mother have heard god's thundering power rattle rattle rattle upon the heads of his enemies and the lord hath shew'd me he will destroy this place a wo will be to the children of

pride in that day and wo wo will be to the blind guides that wear the long robes the false teachers of this nation did not our blessed lord say if the blind lead the blind both should fall in to the ditch ah lord how should it be otherwise for they hate the light and count it an insufficient thing
did not our blessed saviour say believe in the light that you may be children of the light and bid them all watch and pray lest they enter into the enemies temptations and how could they watch without light for they could not see the tempter when he came in the dark
ah that scripture is fulfilled upon this people that darkness should cover the earth and gross darkness the people and then night should be unto them that they should not have visions and the day shall be

dark that you shall not divine
and this was egypt darkness ah but the children of israel had light in the land of goshen extoled be thy name thou god of power if thou wilt be pleased to restore me to my former strength then will speak of thy wonderful power yea my voice shall be as the sound of a trumpet which shall convert sinners unto thee yea will sit in the dust and cover my head with ashes and put on within and without

then she taking to drink lay still a little time after but immediately broke forth with joy in her heart making sweet melody to the lord and so lay half an hour singing unto lord but not uttering any words then she broke forth into praising and magnifying his great works

that cursed place that house of abominations that that abominable house where they commit their abominable whoredoms god will destroy it
her mother said unto her what house my dear child she answered

that church as they call it in the members thereof are proud persons and covetous and deceitful lyars drunkards and whoremongers ah my blessed saviour said we should know them by their fruits
these were my cursed fruits which brought forth when was a hearer of that church pride and disobedience to my parents how often have adorned my self as fine in their fashions as could make me yet they have looked upon me with scorn and despised my dress and said unto me how like a taudrey you have drest your self you are not at all in the mode

then came home on their sabbath day and gone immediately up into my chamber and locked the door and altered all my laces and so have gone to their worship in the afternoon drest in their mode and then have pleased them
pray my dear mother call my father have something to say to him desire my body may not be laid in that abominable place but among the people of the lord called quakers for now am a true quaker now tremble before the lord and his holiness come ye holy prophets who were quakers and tremblers at the word of the lord come moses jeremiah come holy habakkuk now am one with thee now my belly trembles my lips quiver and my heart drops because of the lord and the greatness of his majesty

my lord yea my lord for so can call thee because thou rulest in me and my soul is subject to thee but they have many lords and many gods they have gods of silver and gods of gold the work of their own hands

lord my strength fails my father my heavenly father wait upon thee renew my strength my holy father be pleased to restore me to my former health then will wait diligently upon thee will sit on the ground with my head in the dunghil my heart shall never go after the sight of my eyes
my dear mother pray for me for whatsoever thou askest of the lord it shall be given thee
the reason why desire to live is because have so greatly dishonoured the lord in my former life and now would live the rest of my time to his praise

for now if live shall be as one raised from the dead to declare his wonders but what shall say tho one should rise from the dead they would not believe

she was exceedingly filled with the indignation of the lord against the priests and spoke very much against their idle practices and their abominable ways which is not taken in writing but these words the writ down as she spoke them she cryed out aloud and said

father father these priests that deceive the people they study all the week what to say when sunday cometh father but the day of the lord is coming that he will confound all their study and all their wisdom and in that day they shall not be heard for their much speaking they are physitians of no value

my dear mother fear shall

not have a place so near the lord as my soul desires for am sensible there are degrees of glory and as the creature acts here for the lord so shall its reward be hereafter have done nothing for the lord but he hath done all for me therefore desire to live that might live a holy and righteous life that my conversation might be in heaven though my body be here on the earth that might invite all as david did to taste and see how good the lord is they have tasted of their perishing life of vanities yea they they have drunk a full cup their measure is running over but they never tasted the joys the unspeakable ravishments of soul that attend the humble holy life of jesus oh if they had ever tasted the least mite thereof they would bid adue to all their dirty life of vanity ah they

would not dare to spend their precious time in adorning themselves like jezabels patching and painting and curling their monstrous heads but the christian life is another thing they must not give themselves the liberty to think their own thoughts much less to act such abominations as these

after she had lain a while praising and magnifying the lord then she spoke very deep and weighty things which are not set down concerning the wise virgins and their lamps burning and exhorted all to keep very diligently upon their watch for said she

the lord will come as a thief in the night and in a day when he is not looked for therefore watch and pray continually here the tempter cannot enter this is the way my saviour spake off when he said you must take up your daily

cross this is that flaming sword which is spoken of you must pass through mark that you must pass through it before you can come to the tree of life this is the cup my saviour asked if you could drink off and this was that baptism he asked if you could be baptized withal come all you that call your selves christians what of the life of holy jesus is in you who was a man of sorrows you light and airy ones you wild and wanton ones you that are lovers of pleasures more than god you workers of iniquity who are always crying lord lord but do not the things that say this shall be your dreadful doom that you are saters but not doers you workers of iniquity that think you can never have enough of the pride of life the lust of the eye which is not of my heavenly

father and so you are of your fathor the devil for his servants you are whom you obey

at another time she said

have heard them say that my mother is so grounded in her religion that it is impossible ever to turn her
my mother is grounded indeed she is established upon the rock that shall never be moved my mother shall never be moved her name is written in heaven yea in the lamb's book of life it is sealed it is sealed the lord hath told me so and bid me tell her there should none be able to pluck her out of his hand

come my blessed mother have something to say to thee thou art mary thou art mary my mother thou hast chosen that good part which shall never be taken from thee thou shalt sit continually at the feet of thy lord ay this is my mother's portion what

portion is like this this is more than to sit in the thrones of princes

be ye holy as the lord your god am holy this they say is impossible
would the holy just and true lord command that which is impossible in this they count the lord a hard master but what can my soul say of thy power when sought thee but could not find thee knocked hard but none would open for my sins stood like mountains that could not come near thee would fain have prayed but could not lay several days and nights prostrate before thee strugling for life but could find none and said there is no mercy for me then said will never leave thee if perish will perish here will never cease crying unto thee then heard a voice say jacob wrestled all night

before he obtained the blessing then thy word was strength to my soul then my stony heart was broken to pieces before the lord and then the spirit of prayer and supplication was poured into my soul and now can sing as david did of mercy and judgment unto thee lord will sing with a rended heart and my mouth in the dust will sing praises unto thee my blessed saviour


for several days she had a very great conflict in soul and spirit concerning the tempter and strong were her cryes to the lord for strength to overcome the enemy she was so deeply engaged in the holy war of the lord against the enemy that she would not suffer her head to be removed from the pillow but said it must be as it were nailed there till she had overcome the

tempter she said would not suffer a thought to wander if move shall be drawn off my watch and then the tempter will prevail then she had a vision and as it were the appearance of an angel giving us the full description thereof which we have forgot only that it was arrayed in white she had also a vision of the tempter which she said stood before her bound in chains then she said it is finished have overcome my saviour hath bound him then she broke forth into blessing and praising and magnifying the lord that it is beyond the tongue of utterance to give a relation thereof for many days and nights together she would hardly suffer her self to slumber but would waken her self to sing praises unto the lord and to declare of his wonderous works that he hath done for her soul

some friends came into the room but she saw them not and after many sweet and precious words she said

don't you feast but fast you are the people that must fast and pray and be you contented with mean things what matter for fine houses or silken apparel remember him that sate on the ground but wore a garment without a seam our blessed holy lord who went up to the mountain to pray that himself into gardens and desolate places of the earth my soul hath fellowship with him
my dear mother if it please our dear and heavenly father to spare me this time we will get us into the country to some little remote place amongst the woods where none can hear us then shall our crys pierce thro the heavens which shall make

the earth to ring and the birds shall hear the eccho thereof there my blessed mother will we sing praises praises praises with rended hearts and our mouthes in the dust to the one holy holy lord
thou glorious one thou hast overcome my heart thou hast ravished my soul thou pure pure holy one what shall say of thee or what shall render to thee for thy to me my heart is overcome with thy love praises be unto thee for thy to me
how shall do to set forth thy goodness for my heart drops before thee

lord if it be thy holy pleasure to take me out of this life then let me have beseech thee one whole day that my tongue may never cease praising thee

and the lord answered her request

all that day she was wonderfully

filled with the sweet solace of the heavenly life singing praises and hallelujahs to the lord and spoke very much concerning the lamb and his followers which had washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb and towards the evening while the power of the lord was upon her there came in two persons to see her and she uttered many precious heavenly words which were not taken in writing at which time these words were spoken by her what matter for fine houses and silken appearel and so went on above half an hour and with a very great weight upon her spirit saying israel what hath thy god done for thee then uttering many deep weighty words she said the daughters of sion are haughty they go with their necks and their wanton eyes uttering many

more deep words then taking up an inward lamentation she said what shall we do for the daughters of jerusalem

after several days lying in the sweet solace and heavenly life of the lord in which time she uttered many heavenly things which were not taken in writing she did express these words

thou beloved of my soul what shall say of thee for thou art too wonderful for me praises be unto thee come all ye holy prophets praise you the lord with me praise the lord my soul upon the instrument ye glorious angels you that excel in glory sing praises to him that sits upon the throne how am overcome ye stones in the street why rise ye not up to praise him that lives forever thou light praise thou the lord and

thou darkness praise and exalt him above all things forever thou son and moon ye stars in the firmament of his power magnifie the lord above all forever all ye fishes in the sea why come ye not forth to praise the lord the mighty god who gives you breath and being will praise thee my holy lord god whilest have any breath praise the lord my soul sing praises to the god of my salvation my holy one my holy one thou hast overcome my heart ah thou hast ravished my soul
my dear mother shall be as a new born babe shall be very simple but bear with me for the lord is with me

my dear mother must lay down this body the lord will not trust me longer in this wicked world happy am my saviour

my soul loves thee dearly thy love is better then wine my saviour my holy one how glorious art thou have seen thy glory am overcome my heart is overcome with thy sweet countenance how lovely art thou am ravished my heart is ravished with thy innocent looks with the sweet smiles of thy glorious countenance come away come away why dost thou stay am ready am ready

then lying some time very still heard her in a heavenly harmony in which frame of spirit she departed without either sigh or groan

joan whitrow her testimony concerning the of the lord

oh lord did ever ask riches or honour of thee but have asked wisdom and understanding for

said in my heart the marchandise of that is better than the marchandise of gold and silver lord thou art that wisdom my soul asked which cometh from above that is first pure and then holy and thou art that understanding my heart sought for more than for hidden treasures and did ever ask silver or gold or houses or lands for my childrens portion but have asked the fear of the lord for know if they had that they had all treasures ah glory glory glory be unto thee for what thou hast given me my soul doth magnifie the lord my spirit doth livingly rejoyce in the god of my salvation who hath had regard to the low estate of his oh what shall render unto thee for all thy mercies towards me but to stand continually upon my and to keep in my wards whole nights that when my lord comes in the second watch or in the third watch he may find me with my loyns girded and my light burning that so may be ready in body soul spirit to enter into the joy of my lord
oh my

soul what hath the lord been to thee here even a place of broad rivers the height and length the depth and breadth of the love of god to my soul in this state oh how hast thou come in and supped with me and caused me to eat of the banket that thou hadst prepared and caused me to drink of the wine of thy kingdom so that my cup hath overflowed as it doth at this time in the remembrance of thy gracious goodness what thou hast been to me in the day of tryal and in the many tribulations how thou didst set my feet upon a rock and didst establish my goings praises be unto thee and yet this was a small thing of thy glorious goodness and bountiful but thou hast also given my children a name amongst the living and crowned them with eternal life oh eternal praises and endless hallelujahs be given unto thee our everlasting father oh did ever think in the day when thou led'st me down into the deep that should have thus beheld thy wonders in this the day of thy mighty power wherein thou hast returned me

the answers of my petitions when said unto thee let my children be thy children otherwise desire none for one child in thy fear lord is more to me than a thousand in the spirit of this world then did thy presence me my soul was sweetly solaced in thy love oh then thou answered'st me and said will be a father to thy children and a husband unto thee
oh thou faithful one who is a god like unto thee keeping covenant with them that fear thee for now thou hast performed thy word unto thy servant glory be to thee forever
oh thou holy one what hast thou done for me no heart can conceive no tongue can express the riches of thy love for thou hast given me my children again in the resurrection of thy most holy life though their tabernacle be gone to its place yet they live with me in the spirit for our communion is with the holy one
and now lord what am or what is my family that thou shouldst shew this great kindness to not unto me lord not unto me but unto thy name be the praise for what am

that should offer up an offering unto the lord for out of the willingness of my heart have offered my children unto the lord although my children were as dear to me as my life and could have laid down my life for theirs if the lord had required it yet durst not ask thier life of the lord although my dear child so much desired it but said unto the lord glorifie thy name let thy will be done in my eath as it is in heaven and now lord by thy hand thou hast brought this to pass and for the exaltation of thy glorious name thou powerful god art striking dread and terror into the hearts of thy enemies and all that will not bow to thee shall be slain before thee for thou god how is the throne of iniquity established and thou dispossssed of thy princely dominion whose right it is to reign in the hearts of the sons and daughters of men but they have robbed thee of thy right and entertained thy enemy in thy room but now thou art come now thy day is come thou so long spake of by the mouth of thy holy prophets that thou wilt dismount

the man of sin out of his throne and set thy son upon thy holy hill yea the mountain of the lords house shall be established on the top of all mountains for thou hast determined to destroy all iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness amen amen saith my soul a llg ry glory and eternal praises be given unto thee thou king of glory

joan whitrow

concerning my dear son jason

need not speak much for most that knew him did know what manner of child he was both in person and parts natural therefore shall only give a small relation of some of the sensible words that came from him before he fell sick for the satisfaction of some that desire it
before he went to the latine school he was in a most sweet heavenly frame of spirit and had such a zeal for truth that if any lightness or airyness did appear in any at that time he was a continual reprover of such the precious words that came from him at that time are past out of mind writ

down some of them but they are lost he delighted exceedingly to hear me rehearse the noble acts of the lord and would be exceedingly broken he would often pray when he was alone he did earnestly desire his father upon his that he would let him go from him to the wall that he might pray to his god he desired much to converse with me concerning god and his kingdom and would ask me deep questions with such heavenly expressions to the astonishment of the hearers that have often said in my heart this is the inspiration of the almighty that gives my child this vnderstanding he loved the lord and his people and would often say when he saw any that he thought were good friends it made his heart glad to see them he would often say if live shall be a good quaker shall go forth and declare the word of the lord shall be a true minister will not preach for hire will proclaim the dreadful day of the lord against the wicked
about three days before he fell sick he said unto me mother the next time go to the tavern

they will bid me preach a sermon to them in latine then will say unto them will preach you a sermon in english and they will bid me say on then will say wo to the proud persons wo to the scoffers wo to the drunkards of england wo unto them that rise early to follow drunkenness and to them that continue until night till the wine doth enflame them you workers of iniquity what will you do in the dreadful day of the lord that is coming upon england for because you have wasted the good creatures upon your lust the lord will bring a famine upon england
mother sometimes have such a trouble in me that am not so good as would be that play so much and do not every thing as you would have me pray to the lord and say lord destroy this wicked one in me and put thy fear into my heart that may never do any thing that shall displease thee yet for all this the devil will come in and take my mind off the lord oh then am so troubled that say lord have mercy upon me
the day before he fell sick he did take me by the hand and said mother shall

dye oh that you might dye with me that we might both go to the lord together then said my dear child why dost thou desire to dye he answered that might be always with my dear lord god and out of this wicked world
when at any time he had seen me retired unto the lord he hath sate down by me and would be mightily broken and hath often said weeping oh that did enjoy that that you enjoy oh that did know what the fear of the lord was that my heart might be made glad as yours is
the lord shewed me when he was three years of age he was his beloved child and he would take him and from that time have expected his death

he departed this life not being six years and a half old

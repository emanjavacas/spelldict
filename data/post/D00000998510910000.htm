Qu. mar ¶TO THE RIGHT Honourable and verteous Lady, the Lady Elizabeth Russell &c. T. A. wisheth increase of honoure, with happy proceedinges, in grace and vertue.
chapiter de magnificentia, among other thinges maketh mention of one Aconitanus, that presented vnto Alphonsus King of Calabria, a Box of Amber, very curiously artificialy wrought, which being opened by the King: had nothing else but a little sflye enclosed within.
Surely (sayd Alphonsus the reward is but smal, notwithstanding a Prince that measureth it not so much by the price, as by the rarenes ther+of, accountes it for a moste precious present.
And hauing so sayde, hee stoode a great while amazed, bethinking himselfe, with what kinde of rewarde hee mighte worthily reco~pence him that gaue a gifte so geason: Madam offer not vnto your honoure an Amber Box with a Fly, as Aconitanus did, nor my cap ful of water as Synctes did, nor mine ha~d+ful of leaues, as another Persian did, and yet the thinge that offer agreeth in one respect to all these three, againe in one point differeth from one of them onelye.
It agreeth with all three in basenes: and it differeth onely from the Amber Box, which preferred a glosing and bewtifull showe to the outward vewe, and yet had nothing with in it but a thinge of noughte: much lyke vnto an house, which outwardlye is verie sumpteously adorned, yelding a port of great maiestie and magnificence to the eie, but when a man is entred in to it, there is nothing to be seene but onely the bare wales.
VVherevnto the thinge that offer is cleane contrary: For it yeldeth no glorious nor glistringe glose nor any coloure of delighte vnto the eye: notwithstanding haue so prouided that the matter therein contained shall suffice to commend it without the helpe of any externall orname~ts.
And hauing at last brought the same to perfection, could not call to reme~beraunce any person of estate, on whome had greater cause to bestowe it, then vpon your honoure.
For considring, your courteous amiable acceptatio~ of those fewe ragged verses, whiche, aboute two yeares paste presumed to tender vnto your discreete iudgement, must needes confesse that, from that time to this present day, haue bene depely indebted vnto your good Ladyship.
And nowe, somewhat what to discharge my selfe of that continuall burthen, and to make satisfaction in part, of the debte which haue so longe owed: haue compiled this little booke of Prayers grounded vpon the deuine promises contained in the sacred Scriptures, which haue aduentured to publish vnder the patronag of your Ladyships name, crauing that as ofte soeuer, as God shall put it in your mynde to withdrawe your selfe into your closet, there to meditate vpon the heauenly promises, of our most mercifull Father, (as your vexteous mynde is very seldome, or neuer at all, otherwise enclined,) that then you woulde vouchsafe to take this booke in hand, and turning to any title may serue your tourne, to apply the prayer folowing vnto your present purpose.
But perchaunce you will say that there are alredy diuers sundry bookes of prayers, which haue bene set fourth by men of greater vndersta~ding riper iudge+ment then I, and therfore it was a needeles and superfluous trauaile to wade any furthar in that matter.
Indede Madame graunt that ther are many praier bokes published, but yet am of this opinion that if there were ten tymes as many, yet there were not to many.
For the common prouerbe is, quo o~munius, eo melius: The more common a good thinge is, the better it is And therefore will hardly be perswaded, that my laboure could anye way haue bene better employed, then in suche causes as concerne the aduauncement of Gods glory, and the propagation of vertue.
VVell such as it is haue presumed to offer vnto your honoures with assured hope, that you will deeme of it, as your noble nature hath ben alwaies enclined to iudge of them that attempt the like enterprises: that you will accept it as a sure toke~ and testimonie of his loyall affection and readie dutie, that would thinke himselfe happie to bee accoumpted but as the least in the number of those that woulde be allwayes at your Ladiships commaundement.
Almighty and moste mercifull Father, who of thine vnspeakeable loue, and pitie, toward the disobediente, and loste children of Adam (when wee were caried awaye thorough sinne, and ignoraunce to damnation, folowing Sathan, after the blind, and vnbrideled lusts of the fleshe) diddest reconcile vs to thee by grace, and adopcion in Christ Iesus, the righteous and immacu+late Lambe, by faith and sure confidence, grounded on the merites of his death whereby we are redeemed from the eternall prison of death and damnation, haue mercy vpon vs, mer+cifull louing Father, so quicken our dul and heauy mindes, by the inspiration of thy holy spirite, that we maye shake of this dead sleepe, continualy watch in thee, abandoning the worckes of darcknes, and walking in the worckes of light, whereby we may be worthy to walk in this holy vocation (where vnto thou haste called vs (and with thine elected sainctes, to sing prayses vnto thee, and at all seasons times, to glorify thy holy name.
And among all other benefites which thou of thy free mercy, doste dayly and hourely, most aboundantly bestow vpon vs, we yeeld thée mortall thankes, for yt thou haste to vs both this night and all the time and dayes of our life, vnder the shadowe and protection of thy winges, keeping our eyes waking in thée, without any idle dreames, or phantasies, that might disturbe our mindes from the meditation of thy grace, and haste safely brought me to the beginning of this daye, from the drousy graue of my bed, which manifestly, resembleth in lying downe my death, and in rysing vp a manifest tipe and figure of my resurrection.
Therfore sith thou of thy mercy haste raysed me vp from this earthly reast, wherein my mortall body, and corrupt nature hath ben partly recreated from the laboures trauayles, which dayly sustayne in this terestrial pilgrimage, also beséech thee, to direct me with thy holy spi+rite, both this day and euer that all my doinges maye tend to thy glory and to the commoditie of my
And graunt most, merciful Father, that the residue of my whole life, fro~ he~ceforth may he gided happly vnder thy tuition, whereby all ma+ner of darkenes, misbeliefe infidelitie, carnall lustes, and affections, may be vtterly chased, driuen out of my hart, and that may be iustified saued, both body and soule, through a right and perfect fayth, in Christ Iesu, and so walke in the light of thy most holy word co~maundements, all the dayes of this my fraile and transitory being.
Arme vs with thy grace, most mercifull father, and strengthe~ vs, by thine assistaunce, to vanquishe the power of the sinfull flesh, and Sathan, yt hauing victory in the end, we may ioyfully triumphe in thy saluation, that art ye God of our strength and might.
Endue our blynde hartes with thy heauenly spirite, that being strong in fayth, although in ye flesh, we may so rule the bridle of our course, both now and euer from henceforth, that we sleepe not in sinne (as ye vnbeleuers doo) which haue no hope of resurrection in Christ Iesu, but folowing the motion of their owne common sence, are so linked and tyed to ye ground, that their grosse capacitie is not of force to loke vp, and to be holde the brightnes of thy diuinitie, which art God from the be+ginning, for euerlasting, world without ende.
To whome with the sonne, the holy Ghost be al honor and glory for euer, euer, Amen.
Almighty and moste mercifull Father, maker of heauen, and earth, with all that is therein, whose works are insercheable, whose mercy is innite, whose power is aboue the Cloudes of heauen, we beséech thee of thy accustomed fatherly piety, and pittie, that thou wilte vouchsafe to be our watche man, this night and euer to gard vs from all our enemies, both bodily or ghostly, that endeuour to disturb the externall rest of our body, or to assalt the infernall Closet of our Conscience, with any sinful suggestions, or deuilish deuises of Sathan our mortall foe, and deadly aduersary.
We acknolege and confesse moste mercifull Father, that of our selues, we are not worthy to lifte vp our eyes towarde heauen, much lesse to presume in presenting oure+selues before thy deuine maiestie, with confidence that thou wilte heare our prayers, or incline to our petitions, if we call to remembraunce the vnworthines of our own merites and desertes, for we are nothing else but a lumpe of sinne, conceaued and borne in iniquity, folowing the right path of our naturall imbecilitie, and weakenes in Adam, euer more prone and apt to folowe the filthy appetite of our own desire, like vnbrideled Colts, and reiecting the holsome discipline, and instructions of thy most holy wil and com+maundements.
Our own consciences accuse vs, and our own sinz beare witnes against vs, that we are nothing else but miserable wretches, subiect to corrup+cion, clothed with iniquity and not of our selues able to thinck as muche as one good thought, so that wée are not able to abide the ex+tremitie of thy straighte iudgement, knowing that by the worckes of the flesh we are condemned to deth yet quickned in the spirite and iustified by grace, in Christ Iesu.
Wee knowe most merciful Father that thou art a righteous Iudge such a one as visiteth the sinz of the Fathers, vpon the Children to the thirde and fourth generation, and doest not Iustify the synners, and them that walk in the waye of iniquitie, but punishest the falts of al such as transgres thy holy lawes and commaundementes.
Notwithstanding most mercifull Father, seing thou hast promised to here vs, whensoeuer we repent vs of our sinz, from the bot+tom of our harte and vnfai+nedly do call vpo~ thy name for help, we haue presumed to appeale to thy Throne of mercy, humbly co~fessing our manifold sinz and offences, and crauing remission of our trespasses, in ye bowels of thy onely begotten sonne Iesus Christ, our intercessor and sauioure.
Haue mercy therefore vpon vs Lord, and forgiue vs our offences, instruct vs with thy holy spirite, to en+ter into examinatio~ of our owne selues by a stedfast fayth in Christ Iesu, with worckes correspondent to the same, we may earnestly and hartely repe~t, from the very bottome of oure hartes, and euer hereafter to thirst after thy law, and statutes, euen as the harte desireth the brookes of water.
And last of all, for as muche as it hath pleased thée of thy heauenly wysedome, to prepare, and ordee the night for man to rest, and refresh himself after his dayly trauayles, grant we beséech thée most mercifull Father, that as our bodies do take a careles sléepe, so contrarily, our soules maye watche in thée, expectting dilligently that happy time when our Lord Iesus shal appear for our deliuerance out of this mortall life into another more and happy life, the ioyes wherof noe mans capacitie is able to conceaue, much les is the tongue able worthily to expresse the happines thereof.
To that life we beséech the to bring vs for Iesus christ his sake.
Almighty and moste mercifull Father the euerlasting fountayne, and well spring of al grace, and goodnesse, whose mercy is incomprehensible, and power infinite, thou the eternall Iehouah, in whose handes are all the corners of the earth, the strength of the hilles is thine also, whose omnipotent power, fashoned the Sea, and prepared the dry land, haue mercy vpon vs, miserable and wretched sinners, and encline thy fatherly eare, vnto the voyce of our prayers.
Increase most heauenly fa+ther in our mindes, the sparckes of true fayth, and Christianitie that, being al+wayes garded with the defence of thy holy worde, we may haue power and force to renounce, and resiste the terrible inuasions, of our mortall enimy Sathan, who continualy rangeth about, like a roaring Lion, séeking whome he may denoure.
And sith wee are chaunced in these perillous tymes, wherein noughte but iniquitie raigneth, and Antechrist aduaunceth himselfe in thy temple exalting him+self aboue all that is called God, infecting thy poore dis+posed ock, with the poysoned of damnable heresy, illuminate we be+séech thée moste merciful fa+ther our blinded eyes, with the true light of thy heauen+ly grace, that being armed with ye shield of thy diuine inspiration, we may therby be the more emboldned to withstand the dayly and innumerable assalts of our ghostly enemie, that continually laboureth by all meanes possible to wreste the worde of trueth and vn+dersta~ding out of our harts page duplicate] page duplicate] and to throwe vs headlong into the bottomlesse lake of euerlasting perdition, and whereas withoute the inspiration of thy heauenlye grace, we are not able so much as to thincke a good thought, and much les able to resist the sinfull allurements of our corrupt flesh, the world and the Deuill, therefore we craue of thée most heauenly Father, that thou wilte vouchsafe to make perfecte that good worcke, which thou hast be gonne in vs, not suffering those fewe sparckes of thy heauenly grace which thy spirite hath planted in our hartes, to be extinguished, or quenched, by meanes of our weakenes and inconstancie, but augmenting in our mindes the zeale of thy word, we may be able to re~der an accou~pt at that dreadfull day, of the hope and fayth which we haue in thée, by the merites of thy sonne Iesus Christe, our Messias and Sauiour, whome thou hast vouchsafed to send into the earth, héere to be incarnate of the pure virgine Mary, and ha+uing receaued the image of our humanitie, to offer him selfe as an acceptable sacrafice, vpon the alter of the most bitter Crosse and by the of his moste precious bloud, to pay the raunsome of our offences vnto thy diuine maiestie, whereby he reconciled vs vnto thée, our heauenly Fa+ther, whereas otherwise we had beene subiect to the thraldome, of euerlastinge damnation.
To thée with the same Iesus Christ, thy sonne, and the holy spirite, covnited al three in Godhead, and di+stinguished in person, be all honor and glory for euer, and euer, Amen.
Eternal God, and euerlasting Father, the author and fountayne of all goodnesse, the multitude of whose benedictio~s, and benefites, farre passe and excéede, the compasse of humayne reason and capacitie, indue our frayle minds with the grace of thy heauenly spirite, that mortifiing our owne desires, and affections, our onely ioy delite may be placed in the perpetuall consideration of thy heauenly promises, and renouncing all care, and regard of worldly businesse, which commonly withdrawes our mindes from the contemplation of thine infinite mercies, we may be wholie addictted to ye seruice of thy diuine ma+iestie, in spirite, and true humulitie of minde, reioycing together in Psalmes, Hymnes, and spirituall Songes, comforting one another in thy promise of that day, wherin thou hast promised to make vs felow of thine heuenly inheritaunce, with Abraham, Isaack, and Iacob, in that celestiall mansion, which thou haste ordeyned for thine elect, since the beginning of the world.
And because by reason of oure naturall corruption, which we haue successiuely receued, since the fall of oure great Grandfather Adam, we are all naturally bente and inclined to goe astray strengthen most mercifull Father our féeble spirites, with inspiration of thy heuenly grace, that being armed against al the assaults of the flesh, the worlde, the Deuill, and Antichriste, that Capitall enimy of thy worde, we may haue oure consciensces cleare, from all maner temtations, and altogether vacante to the Meditation of the promises expressed in the Gospell of thy sonne Iesus Christe, our sauioure.
Endue vs with the diuine influence of thy spirite, that we maye neuer be caried away with the fleshe, but by the operation of thy grace, in our hartes, we maye be able to mortify, subdue our carnal afections and wordly desires whereby our zeale may be the more enflamed to insue the heauenly motions of thy holy spirite, which directeth the mindes of them that feare thée, in the perfect pathway of lighte, and vnderstanding.
Graunte this most mercifull father, for thy Sonne Christe hys sake, to whom with thée the holy Ghost, be al honor and glory, from this time forth for euermore.
prayer for vnity in Religion Euerlasting and moste mercifull Father the fountayne of all grace, and goodnes, which art the God of peace, loue, vnitie and concorde, and the iuste reuenger of disce~tion, debate and confusion, thou séeste, howe miserably thy holy congregation is rent, torn and deuided into diuers sectes, and contrarieties in religion, while the carnall professors of thy name, in cloake of prete~ded holines set forth mainteine such beggerly traditions, as the appetite of theire grosse phantasie leadeth them vn+to, shaking of the sweete yoke of thine vndefiled law wresting the letter thereof to serue the dissolute motion of their carnall cogitations, mainteining in stéede of thy pure sincere word, the fleshly cerimonies of their own deuise, and inuention whereby it commeth to passe that so great dissention raigneth now adayes in the world, and that so many sectes schismes, and heresies are daylye sette a broach in euery place, to the vnspekeable perturbation of the course of thy word, and vtter subuersion of diuers common wealthes, whiche oughte chiefly to be mainteined by the vniform consente and iudgement, touching the worde, and by the perfecte band of Amity, concerning temporall causes.
But now wheras men set aside the ryght rules, and or dinaunces of thy blessed worde, plantinge in steed thereof, orders and tradicions of their own imaginations, howe can it come to passe that christian peace and vnity of spirite, should dwell among vs.
Therefore graunt most mercifull Father, that wee thy pore dispersed shepe which haue so long ben tossed and turmoyled with tempests of this tumultuous times, may at the last by the direction of thine heauenly Spirite, bee reduced into one foulde, acknoweleging thee our moste louing shepehearde, and mercifull Father, thy sonne Iesus Christe, our onely sauiour and Mediatour to thy diuine maiesty, the holy ghost our comforter, whyche by the mouth of thy sonne Iesus Christ, thou didst promise to send vnto vs, which spirite assureth our spirites that we are pertakers, inheritours, and fellow Citizens of that heauenly Ierusalem, whiche thou promysedst to all them, that vnfai+nedly walke in thy statutes and trust onely to be saued by the blood, and passion of thine onely begotten sonne Iesus Christ, our Messias, the onely of all mankinde.
Remoue moste mercifull Father, from our eyes, the darcke shadow and vayle of ignoraunce, that abandoning al the dregges of erronious sectes, heretical schismes, we may be gathered all together into the vnitie of thy word; and confesse that there is but one eternall God, and one heauenly Fa+ther, which thou arte, and one Fayth one which we all professe, that call vpo~ thy name.
Graunt also most merciful father ye we whose minds, opinio~s are noted most repugnant, and contrary in fayth may he altogether covnited into one iugement; opinion in religion, which maye bee grounded onely vppon the foundations of thy and Apostles Iesus Christ, himselfe being the head corner stone.
And sith ther is but one fayth, which directeth vs into the waye of saluation, graunt we beséech thée, that by the opera+tion of thy holy spirite, we may be brought to such an a+gréement, and vniformity in Religion, that we maye glorify thée our heauenly Father, with one onely spi+rite, and generall consente of conscience whereby wee maye be reduced from the captiuitie of eternall ignoraunce, and be made al the shéepe of thee our most mer+cifull and bountifull shéepheard, To whome with.
VVE render vnto thée most mercifull Father, immortall thankes, for that thou hast vochsafed, to send thine onely begotten sonne Iesus Christ, into the world to take our shape, and nature vpo~ him and to submit himselfe to the bitter passion of the Crosse, to redéeme vs wret+ched sinners, which before were thrales and bonde slaues to the horrible sormente of euerlasting damnation.
what condigne thankes are we able to render vnto thée, that in the least respect, may be able to counter payse thy fatherly kindnes and loue, which thou daily vnto vs, most myserable and wretched sinners.
Thou hast sent thy Christ our Sauioure, to redeeme vs from the bondage of sinne, death, and damnation, and that not with Gold nor Siluer, but with his most bloode, once offered vpon the Crosse to paye our generall raunsome The promises which thou diddest make to our 'forefa+thers, in figures and shadows, thou hast openly per+formed to vs in the open sight of the whole worlde, in sending that to take our sins vpon him, to be scourged for our and to beare the burthen of our iniquities· Againe, thou hast manifested to vs the perfect pathwaye of saluation, by the mouth of thine onely begotten son Iesus Christ, and that not in figures, nor shadowes, but in expresse wordes, say+ing (Hoc fac viues) do this and thou shalt liue, which to our forefathers thou declaredst couertly, and in ye darke shadowes of secrete misteries, and that not by thy sonne Iesus Christ but but by thy prophets which were men mortall as we be, and were inferioure to thy sonne, both in diuine power, and also in dignity of person.
For how muche the seruaunt or bondman is inferiour to the heyre, so much are the Prophets in+feriour to thy sonne, and heyre, Christ Iesus, whom our mortal eyes haue séene of late dayes, personally here in the earth, and reasoned with him face to face euen at his owne mouth haue learned what is the will of thée our moste louing Father, and moste mercifull creatoure.
And moreouer because it was thy good pleasure to take a+waye the presence of thy sonne, from mankinde as concerning the fleshe, we yeld thée moste harty thankes that thou wouldest vouchsafe to se~d down thine heauenly spirite, into the hartes of all thy sonnes Apostles, which spirite informing their spirites, of thy diuine will, prouoked them by writing to reuele thy promises of saluation (whereof thy sonne preached) vnto the posterity of all ages, for euermore, both we that now liue, and the remnaunte of all future yeres may lerne to direct their steppes, as with a true line, or rule, into the waye of thy commaundementes.
And sith in recompence of all these thine vnspeakeable benefits, thou requirest no other sacrafice, but thankes giuing with contrition of harte, therefore with vncessaunt prayers wee will magnify thy holy name, re+cordi~g thine innumerable benefites, with Psalmes of thankes geuing in the midest of the congregation for euer, not doubting, but thou of thine infinite goodnes, wilt accept the thanks which we yelde to thy dyuine Maiestie, as procéeding from the very bottom of our vnfained hartes.
To thée most mercifull Father with thy son Iesus Christ and the holy ghoste, be all honour and glory for euer, Amen.
and moste mercifull Father, who by thy diuine wisedome, diddest lay the foundations of heauen, and earth with the Sea and al that is ther+in, haue mercy compassion of thy pore flock, dispersed through the whole erth for the constant profession and testimony of thy heauenly worde, and deliuer them at laste, from the tirrany of Pharao, ye terrible persecutoure of thy poore members.
And because that in all Landes many departe into voluntary exile, whose con+science cannot sustayne to sée thy true worde corrupted with the superstitious traditions of mortal men, we beseech thée moste heauenly Father to inspire the dewe of thy spirite, into the hartes of all Christian Kinges, and Princes, in whose handes consistes the reformatio~ as wel of eccle+siastical as ciuil politike causes: that by the motion of the same spirit they may be the more feruentlye enflamed with the and loue of thy glory and be the more bent to plant the séedes of thy true Religion, through all their dominions, kindle moste (mercifull Father) in their harts a desire, to deface all blinde cerimonies, and supersticious idolatry, which in any respect, maye séeme preiudiciall, or derogatory, to thy glory let them break down their hill alters, hew down their groues, burne their Images with ye no one monument of them be left vpon the earthe, and that when they are sought for, their place may not be founde, so that the name memory of them may decay, and perish with the of their consumed tim+ber.
Let their moltion Images be consumed with fire, and their grauen Shrines be brought to co~fusion.
For thou art a God, agelous God, one that cannot suffer a mate, or pere in thy Dominion.
Thou wilt be worshipped in truth and righteousnesse of hart, and not with blockishe and sencelesse Images, ye work of mens hands, which haue eares and heare not: eyes, and see not: noses, smell not: mouthes, and eate not: handes, and feele not: feete, and goe not: but are caryed hither and thether, vpon mens shoulders, like sencelesse stockes as they are, in no respect, resembling any figure of diuinitie or
And bicause the vse of these phantastical Idols, tendeth especially to ye preiudice and prophanatio~ of thine omnipotent diuine power, (who hast commau~+ded by expresse wordes in thy law, that we should not make to our selues the like+nesse of any thinge in heauen, or earth, or in the waters to bow vnto) Graunt, we besech thée, thy grace, to all princes, and potentates, that beare as wel the spiritual sword, as ye title of tem+poral gouernme~t, that they may be moued with thyne heauenly motion, to purge thy church fro~ all the dregs of superstition, and Idolatrie, wherby thy poore flock yt is now dispersed through the whole worlde, may be brought againe into one vniforme consent of Religion, seruing thee in lowlines and purenesse of hart, abdoning all the rabble of Ro+mayne traditions, and idolatrous ceremonies, cleauing only to the rule of thy holy gospel reuealed by thy sonne, Iesus Christe oure lord Sauiour.
To whom with the Father the holy Ghost, thrée persons one God, be all honour glory world without ende.
WE yelde vnto thée, (most mightie, mer+cifull Father) immortall thanckes, for that it hathe pleased thée of thy méere mercie and fatherly bountye, after the stormes of so many troublesome tymes, to conduct vs into the comfortable port of tra~quilitie, by the hand of thy most gra+cious seruaunt, our déere soueraigne Lady, Elizabeth.
When we were as shéepe, wandring astray in ye wildernes, thou ordainedst hir Maiestie, to be our Shepeheard, to gather vs againe into thy shepefould.
When we had bene long lossed hither thether, with the out+rage and cruel fury of tira~nicall persecution, like a poore weatherbeate~ Bark, that hath bene continually turmoyled tossed, on the perillous of the outragious and swelling seas, findinge no sure roade, nor harber wherein to rest, but continually in daunger, ey+ther to sinck into the or to be ouerwhelmed with waues, or violently to be dashed in peces against the mayne rockes: Euen then (I say) when we dispayred vtterly of sauegarde, standing still in feare of the hazard of euerlasting confusion, thou committedst the helme, to be guyded by hir graces wisedome, who at laste conducted vs into the hauen of this longe desired peace and tranquilitie.
Therefore whereas thou hast placed hir in the regal throne, to be our Dauid, our Iosias, our Samuel, yea to be our Shéepeheard and in the way of true holinesse, and sincere Religion.
Inspire hir mynde with ye manifold blessinges of thy grace, that she may walke all the dayes of hir lyfe, in the path of thy commaundementes, happely discharge hir dutie, in that stewardship, and dispensation, which thou hast co~mit+ted to hir Maiesties hands.
Inflame hir minde more more with the loue of thy holy gospel, ye all hir déedes, thoughtes, practises, may tend to the propagation, planting of thy worde and true Christian religion, in these hir Maiesties Dominions.
the motio~s of hir vertuous disposition, aboue all thinges to seeke thine honor glory, to sow the seedes of the Catholike fayth, abundantly in all pla+ces, to cut of ye broode of superstition and Idolatry, to constitute true Preachers of thy worde, and establish euery wher thine holy gospel, and true religion.
Preserue hir, moste mercifull father, (as hitherto thou haste moste myraculously done) from the deuilish deuises, and practises of hir enimies, that she may haue a longe and happy raigne, among vs, to the aauncement of thy glory, and ioy and comfort of all hir subiectes Let hir naturall disposition to hir terrible, to hir subiectes to hir offe~ders merciful, to the vertuous bountiful, indifferent to al men, and in all respectes, partial in no point, neither in causes ecclesiastical, nor yet in matters concerninge politike gouernement.
Assist hir, mo merciful Father, with the might of thy heauenly Spirit, to quayle the pryde of the triple headed Romish to banishe his beggarly ceremonies, to abridge the of his raigne, and finally to cut of and preuent the séedes, that continually striue to spring vp from abhominable superstition, and Idolatrie.
Grau~t hir grace, most merciful Father, to runne the remnant of hir race, in the right path of thy commau~dements, declining neither to the right hand, nor to the left, but so vsinge all times thy heauenly word, as the rule, and compasse, to direct hir course.
Preserue hir grace, (most mercifull Father) in continuall healthe of body, and quietnesse of mynde, that she may be alwayes able to rule the bridle of hir charge, and to execute right and Iustice, to all sorts and degrees, to the aduaunceme~t of thy glory, and the vniuersall commoditie of hir· Maiesties subiectes.
And finally graunt (O most mercifull father) that when it shall please thée, to end the terme of hir dayes in this worlde, thou wilt make hir partaker of those celestial ioyes, which are prepared for them that feare thée, since the foundation of the world.
Graunt this, most mercifull father, for thy déere sonne our lord Iesus Christ his sake.
To whom with thee the holy Ghost, three persons and one God, be all glory and honor, world without end.

Let them not be mapleasers, or such as for affectio~s sake winck at offences, and reproue not ye sinners of their sinnes, wherby might be reclaymed from theyr wicked wayes, to the embracinge of thy holy commaundements.
Let them not be suche, as flatter, or fawn vpon Princes, for promotions sake, gapinge for worldly dignitie, not regarding the execution of the office wherevnto they are called.

ALmighty and most Father, which art the onely stay, and comfort of all them that are afflicted with the scourge of aduersitie: bowe down thy mercifull eare vnto the voyce of my lamentation, which am nothing else but a lumpe of sinne, euery houre declyninge from thy co~maundements, into the reprobate way of iniquitie, yt must néedes confesse, that myne owne merites, and deseruinges, haue iustly procured this worthy plage, wher+in like a vyle, and wretched am entangled, But thou (O most mercyfull and louinge Father, yu art alwaies ready to shewe mercy, to the repentant sinner, which hast promised to put all my offe~ces, and misdeedes, out of thy remembraunce, whensoeuer repent, from the bottome of my hart: haue mercy vppo~ my miseries, and velease me of this aduersitie, which hath worthely chaunced, by reason of the innumerable multitude of my sinnes.
And if it be thy good will, and pleasure to proue the more with temtations, or any other kinde of afflection, that thou shalt lay on me, then vouchsafe, most mercifull Father, to arme mée wyth the spirite of which it hath pleased thy diuine Maiestie to lay vpon me. that murmure not at thy workes, neyther blaspheme thy name, when am in miserie, but that maye alwaies haue in mynde, that thou art a mercifull iudge, and a reuenger of iniquitie, to whome onely it beelongeth, to throwe downe to hell, to rayse vp to heauen again where, with thy sonne Iesus Christ and the holy Ghost. &c.
Lord Iesus Christ, ye onely defence, and pyller of our estate, the hope confidence of all them, that sleepe in the vaile of this wicked worlde, which by the merites of thy most pre+tious death, passion, didst ouercome death, and triumphest ouer the sting ther+of, in thy heauenly kingedome: geue strength, vnto vs feeble, and impotent sinners, against the Lyon, whiche continually wandreth aboute séekynge whom he may deuoure, alwayes wyth subtill awaitinges strong temtations, to withdrawe our myndes, from the faith which we haue in thee of euerlastinge lyfe, into a reprobate sence, to geue our+selues vp to the and affections of the fleshe, to vncleannes, Idolatriy, innumerable other like abhominatio~s, that are chiefe aduersaries and enemyes to the spirite of truthe and vnderstanding.
Thou therfore that art the iaculate Lambe, ye vanquisher of sinne, death, and hell, geue vnto vs thy little shéep the strength and vertue of thy spirit, that being in our owne selues weake, and feble, and in thée, strong and valiant, we may be able to withstande and subdue all the assaults of the Deuill, yt our ghostly enemie may not triumph ouer vs, but be+ing co~querors through thée, wée maye geue thankes to thy mercy, which neuer lea+ueth them destritute of whose onely confidence, and aiance, is reposed in the sure defence, and sauegerde of thy mercy Thou knowest, Lord, yt we are but earth and ashes, subiect to corrupsion, mortalitie, the flesh euer rebellinge against the spirite, whereby we are alwaies more prone, apt to runne the carles race of ignorance and iniquitie, then to frame our steppes in the narowe and strayte path of vertue, and vnderstanding.
Therfore, illuminate we besech thée, our blinde eyes, with ye light of thy heaue~ly spirit, that abhoring ye workes of darkenes, and preuaylinge against all temptations of the worlde, the flesh, and the Deuill, we may be wholie bent to serue thy diuine Maiestie, in truthe and vnderstanding, sauinge alwayes an assured hope of a gloryous resurrectio~ on thy right hand, wher we may be pertakers of that ioyfull of life, whiche thou wilt pronounce to all them that shall inherite that heauenly kingdome, with thée, our onely redéemer, and Sauiour.
To whom with the Father, and the holy Ghost. &c.
Almighty Lord, most mercifull Father, the fountayne, and welspring of all heauenly gifts, and graces, geue me wisdom to knowe what thy will and pleasure is: for thy seruant and ye sonne of thy ha~d mayde, am a féeble person, engendred, and created of the frayle substaunce of the flesh, enuironed round about wyth the darke shadowe, of ignoraunce, yt by meanes thereof the beames of my mynde are so obscurely eclipsed, that cannot once looke vp vpon the brightnes of thy diuine Maiestie, nor excercyse my selfe at all in contemplation of the misteries of thy heaue~ly word, and promises, whereby might saue my soule from hell.
Inspire therfore (most mercifull Father) my dull and heauy mynde, with the light of the true wisdome, and not with worldly wit, and policy onely, which concerne humayne affayres, but with the true vndersta~ding of thy sacred scripturs wherein thou hast made a faithfull promise of eternal saluation, to all them that vnfaynedly beleue, that Iesus Christ, is the sonne of God, and the onely redéemer of all mankinde.
Thou knowest, Lord, that my dull capacitie is farre to grosse, to attaine to ye know+ledge, and vnderstandinge of thy iudgeme~ts, lawes· for am but meere corruption, and of a most frayle nature.
And thou how can that am but earthe, and ashes, co~ceaue the meaning of thy diuine mistries? surely, by no meanes, except ye motion of thy spirite myne vnconstant, and wauering mynde in the right way of truth, and vndersta~ding, whereby may be alwayes inflamed, to vpon thy promises, con+tained in thy holy Ghospell wherein thou hast promysed euerlastinge lyfe, to all those that with a stedfast fayth beleue, yt by ye meanes of Iesus Christ, his passio~, they haue obtayned frée remission, of their sinnes.
To whom with ye Father, and the holy Ghost, be all honour; and glory, now and euermore.
ALmighty, and most mer+cifull Father, which art the way, the truth, and life, deliuer me from the hands of them that imagine mischieffe, and thinke vpon deceyt all ye daye longe, whose tongues are more sharp the~ a two edged sworde, and ye poyson of Aspes is vnder their lippes.
Beholde, most mercyfull Father, from thy heauenly throne, thy vineyard which the Boare rooteth vp, and neuer suffreth ye tender branches to spring aboue the ground, but as fast as they bud fourth, he spoiles them, not sufferinge the same to attayne to their full maturitie, perfect ripenes.
Aryse Lord and reuenge thyne owne cause, how long shall thy Ie+lozy sléepe, for euer? remember the afflictions of thy seruantes, that are oppressed with the tyranny of Pharao, and ouerladen with the intollerable burthen of the Egiptian taskes.
Thou séest our misery, and thraldome, and how we are euery day, in daunger to be of the enemy.
And for thy sake onely, doe we suffer reproch al ye day long.
ryse therefore Lorde, like a mighty man of warr and as a stout gyant refreshed with wine.
Looke downe, and behould, howe thy stocke is scattered a+broade, by meanes of the outragiousnes of the wolf, who continually séeketh to roote out, and vtterly to extingush the name of Israell.
Take Armes in hand, and strike in owne cause, and confounde thyne enemyes, wyth the fire of thy heauy displeasure.
So shall thy poore dispersed reduc againe at last in+to one fould, and continuall prayses to thee, the author of our libertie, and our auenger.
To whome with the Sonne and the holy Ghost, be all honor and glory.
VVE render vnto thée, (most merciful father) immortall thankes, for the manifould dayly benefits, which thou of thy mercie, without any desert of ours, hast most abou~dantly poured vpon vs, since the time it pleased thée to inspire into vs the breath of lyfe, framinge our corrupt bodyes in forme of thine own likenes, placing vs in thy pleasant Paradise, there to remayne in most happy and fortunate estate, if through the subtill allurementes of Sathan, our ghostly enimie we had not transgressed thy commaundements.
We thanke thée, also, most mercyfull Father, for that whe~ we were condemned by our owne transgression, in our great Grandfather Adam, thou of thy Fatherly loue, and naturall compassion, yt thou haddest on mankinde, didest send down, thy onely begotte~ Sonne Iesus Christ to take our corrupt Nature vpon hym, and to humble himselfe to the shamefull death, of the Crosse, thereby to redeme vs wretched sinners, from the bondage of hell, whether for our disobedience, we were iustly condemned: and to pay the raunsome of our offences, whereby thy wrathe: that was worthyly inflamed against vs, might be appeased, and we lost sheepe at last reco~cyled to thee our pitifull pastoure, most mercifull Father.
We yeld thée also immortall thankes, moste mercifull Father, for that it hathe pleased thee to reueale thy holy Gospell vnto vs, by thy Sonne Iesus Christ, whereby we might obtaine remission of our sinnes, and through faythe, might haue a sure confide~ce that by the merites of Iesus Christ hys passion, we are deliuered from the intolerable cursse of the lawe, and are made partakers of that heauenly kingdome, prepared for vs since the foundation of the world.
For these thy most bountifull gyftes, and all other thy benefites, dayly and hourely powred vpon vs, we hartely thanke thée, most louing and mercifull Father.
Beseching thée that thou wilt geue vs grace, through the operatio~ of thy heauenly spirit in our myndes, so to order our life, and conuersation, that wee walke in true holines, and sincerity of hart, behauing our selues so circumspectly in this wretched world, that at the last day, we may bée found faltles, and be receaued into the number of the~, to whome this ioyfull sentence shalbe pronounced: Come ye blessed of my Father, possesse ye kingedome, whiche was prepared for you, from the beginning of ye worlde.
To which kingdome, we besech thée, most mercyfull Father, for the merites of thine onely so~ne our Sauiour Iesus Christ, to bring vs speedely out of this vale of misery, and sorowe: where with the societie of ye elect, we may singe prayses to thée our moste mercyfull Father, worlde without ende: To whome wt thy Sonne Iesus Christ, our Sauiour, and the holy Ghost, three in vnitie, and one in trinitie bee all honour, glory, power, dominion and might, from thys time fourth for euermore.
Almighty, and moste mercifull God, the Father, eternall, which haste bene from the beginninge, and so shalt remayne world wt out end: Thou that createst all liuing creatures, and last of all man, breathinge the breath of lyfe into them, by a naturall instinct, and disposition, euery thinge to folowe his owne kind, sauing man only aboue al the rest, whome thou hadest formed after thine own image, and indude hym wyth reason, more then naturall, wherby hée might discerne the good from the euill, and learne to eschewe suche thinges as might be hurtfull vnto him: Euen he say aboue all the rest, transgressed the commaundementes of thy Maiestie, inclining to his owne lustes and affections, without any regarde or fee of thée, his onely Lorde maker.
Whereby hee was expelled out of the garden of Eden, that place of pleasure where once thou hadest placed him.
But (Oh) what thankes shall we yeld vnto thée, (most mercifull and louynge Father, that vouchsafe, of thy méere mercy, and Fatherly loue, toward vs, to sende downe thyne onely begotten sonne Iesus Christ, to be our and Sauiour, to deliuer vs out of the mouth of hell, whither our owne deserts had worthely condemned vs? we will singe a Psalme of thankes geuing, and worship toward thy holy temple.
For what other reward are we able to geue vnto thée, that maye in any respect worthely counter vaile the least sparke of thy Fatherly pyttie, and kindenes? surely none.
For of our owne selues, we are not able so much as to thinke a good thought, wythout the motion of thy spirit, much lesse to doe any suche good déede, yt might be aunswerable to the innumerable multitude of thy benefites alwayes vpon vs Accept therefore, (most mer+cifull Father,) our sacrifice of thankes geuing, bowe downeth neeare to our hu~ble that procedeth from vnyned lippes.
And sith it hath pleased thy diuine Maiestie, to giue vp thy onely begotten Sonne Iesus Christ, to the deathe of the Crosse, for our rede~ption, vouchsafe, Lord, so to direct our myndes, in the way of thy co~maundeme~ts that we may partly seeme worthy of the inestimable price of so great a benefite, as the raunsome of our iniquitie hath cost: and kepe ye eyes of our mynds alwaies waking, that we fall not a sléepe in sinne, as they doe, which haue no hope of resur+rection from the dead.
Engender in our hartes the true zeale of thin vndefiled word, and religion, that we maye bee alwaeis meditatinge vpon thy promises, not founde idle, nor vnprouided when the good man of the house shall come: but yt we may be found wakinge in thée, with plenty of oyle in our lampes, as the fyue wise Uirgins had· drawe vs neere vnto thee, by the operation of thy heauenly grace, heare our prayers, forgeue vs our offences, co~fort vs in our forgeue our enemies, as we hope to haue forgeuenes of all our sinns at thy ha~ds, by the of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, let not myne enemies triumph ouer me, nor ye roaring Lyon deuour me, but protect me alwayes most mercifull Father, vnder ye shadow of thy winges that may strongly constantly withstand his inuasions, by ye vndoubted hope, and confidence that haue reposed in thy mercy: And graunt that maye die in thy true fayth, and rest with thee, in thy euerlasting king+dome.
To whome with thy Sonne Iesus Christ, and ye holy Ghoste: be all honour and glory for euer euer.
Most mercifull Iesu, and onely Sauiour of all ma~kynde, whose loue to vs all was so pure, and vnfayned, that thou didest not denie to take our flesh vpon thee, and to submit thy selfe to the death, in offeringe vp thyne owne bodey, as a swéete smelling sacrifize to appease the indignatio~ of thy father, who was worthyly inflamed for the transgression, and breach of his holy co~maundements.
swéete Iesu, the onely author of our saluation, our most louing mediatour to thy Father, haue mercy vpon me, and cast me not away whome thou with thy pressious bloud haste reiect me not, for am the price of thy passion, thou with the effusion of thy most bloud, halfe payd the raunsome of mine iniquitie, and made a full perfect satisfaction for my offences.
then looke downe vpon my miseries, consider my distresse: Behold the hell that torme~teth my conscience, as ofte as call to remembrance, my lyfe so wickedly past, and the innumerable multitude of my sinnes, which are moe in number the~ the heares of my head, or the sandes of the Sea.
Geue me grace, to repent my wicked lyfe, with Mary Magdelen, and to wash thy feete wyth the moysture of my teares and lamentation.
Geue me grace, to be sory for my sins and to wéepe with Peter, to crye with the thefe, that hanged on the right side, at ye time of thy passion.
geue me grace to call my selfe to remembraunce, to examine mine owne conscience, to recount the number of my sinnes, and to cast my selfe flat prostrate at ye féete of thy mercy, bewayllinge my sinfull lyfe, with many a riuer of teares, to acknowledge mine own wickednes vnto thée, to craue remissio~ of my faultes, and by the continuall teares of repentaunce, to recouer thy fauour againe, and to die ther in.
Geue me grace to leade a new lyfe, to put of the person of Adam, and to bée regenarate and new borne in thée, my Lord and Sauiour.
Geue me grace, swéet Iesu to cry Peccaui with Dauid, and vnfaynedly to lament my sinnes.
Geue me grace swéet Iesu to returne againe with the prodigall or lost Sonne, and to crye: Father, haue sinned agaynst heauen and against thée and am no more worthy to be called thy Sonne: make me as one of thy hyred serua~ts, swéete Iesu haue mercy vpo~ me, and forgeue me my sinnes, renew a right spirit within me, wash me wyth Isope, and shalbe made whyter then Snowe: for vnto thée belongeth mercy, and with thée is plentifull redemption.
thinke not vpon ye offences of my youth wherein haue raunged to much at randon, lyke an vnbrideled coult, neglecting the way of vnderstandinge and loathing the path of thy co~maundeme~ts.
acknowledge fréely, yt if thou sholdest deale with me according to iustice, haue deserued euerlasting death, neyther should be able to abide thy sharpe iudgeme~t, but should sinke downe into the botto~les dungeo~ of eternall damnation.
But hauinge a sure and certayue confidence, fixed on the ancer, or hould, of immoueable fayth, vndoubtedly beléeue, that by thy merites, am made par+taker of euerlasting lyfe, being fréely iustified, with absolute remision of all my sinnes, synce the first houre of my Natiuitie.
Which fayth, ground neyther on the merites of any mortall man, neyther vpon any Romish Pardons, or Indulgences, but onely vpo~ thée, my Lord and Sauiour, who with thy most precious blodsheding, hast payde the price of my iniquitie, and suffered thy glorious body to be mangled and torne for my transgressi+on.
Geue me grace, swéete Iesu, so to order the reste of my lyfe, as beco~meth a true Christian to doe, walkyng in the light of thy holy Gospell, eschewing ye workes of darkenes, behauinge my selfe obediently to my superiors, louingely to my felowes, and conrtiousely to myne inferiors, bearinge no grudge in my conscie~ce, offering wronge to no man, but paciently to sufier iniuries without desire of reuenge: forgeueinge euery man, whatsoeuer hée hathe donne against me, as my selfe would desire to be forgeuen of thée my swéet Sauiour, and onely redéemer.
Geue me grace swéete Iesu to perseuer in my faith till ye end, that all myne actions may be donne in the name of Iesu, and all my thoughts vpon Iesu, both at my down lying, and vp rysinge, all the terme of my lyfe, and at the very instant of death, when fetche the laste gaspe, my mynd may be withdrawen with no idle or phantastical cogitations, but continually excercised in the meditation of the sweete and comfortable name of Iesu, Iesu.
To thee, swéete Iesu, with ye Father, and the holy Ghost, be all honor and glory for euermore.
Holy, and blessed spirite, which being true, euer lastinge God, wyth God the Father, and God the Sonne, procéedest from the~ both coequall in deytie and dignitie of person, which art the onely comforter of them yt trauayle in this earthly Pilgrimage, and by thy heauenly wisdome directest them yt right way, to attaine to heauenly vnderstandinge of the will of God.
Quicken, most holy sprite, by thy heauenly breath, the myndes of them yt afore were dead through sinne, make mery the hartes of yt faythfull penite~t bringe into the way of truth all such as haue erred, and wandred astray in the vale of erroure and ignoraunce, comfort the soules of all them that hunger thurst, after righteousenesse, and suffer persecution for the Testimony of the Gospell, inrich the~ plentiousely with heauenly gyfts which praye vnto thée in the name of Iesus Christ, our onely mediatour, redemer.
Purifie our hartes, we besech thée, with the fire of thy loue, that all yt course of our frayle and mortall life, may be directed by thy heauenly motion, as with an infallible rule and compas, that ca~not lightly erre.
Mortifie in vs all worldly care, carnall lustes, concupiscence, couetousenes, wrath, gluttony, pryde, and all other sinfull inclinations, that may wythdrawe vs from the contemplation of thy glorious deitie.
Renue our spirites wythin vs, that we may seeme regenerate, or new borne as infantes, and illuminate our myndes, wyth thy heauenly benefites, and spirituall gifts that our bodies may be made thy temples, wythout spot, or blemishe, at that dreadfull daye when euery man must yeld account of the workes of his body.
Leade vs into the way of truth, and suffer vs not to be caried away, wyth diuers and straunge doctrin, but alwayes to remayne in that doctrine whereof thou art the author: and vouchsafe to strenghten our myndes in the same, that if an Angell of heauen should teache any other doctrine, then that which thou hast already taught, we may not beleue him, but who+soeuer preacheth any doctrin contrary to that we haue receaued, we may houlde him accursed.
Strengthen our soules, against all assaltes, of our ghostely enemy Sathan, and his cheife minister, yt séeketh by all meanes possible, to remoue the foundations of our fayth, and to pull the word of truth out of our hartes and to throwe vs, headlonge, into the dungeon of erroure, and ignoraunce.
Strength vs against ye vaine allurementes of the wicked woeld, and against all vnclea~ lustes of the fleshe, that wée beinge replenished wyth thy holy breath, may bée founde pure and sanctified in thée and doe those thinges onely that may be acceptable in thy sight.

besech thée also, (most blessed Trinitie,) that thou of thy accustomed mercy, and loue, wilt make perfect in me, that good worke, which thou haste begonne, and leade me in all truth, and godlynes, hauing my mynde alwaies fixte vpo~ thée, my moste louinge and mercyfull Father, cause me alwaies to thinke, and speake and to doe those thinges, that may he acceptable to thée, restrayne my tonge, from all idell and vnhonest talke, because, that at yt dreadfull daye of iudgement, am to render an accompte, of euery idell word, that haue spoken during the terme of my former lyfe.
Kepe my hart, and body, my sences, my doinges, my talke, and communication in thy holy lawes, in ye workes of thy co~maundements.
Geue me grace, to leade an vpright lyfe, wythout to my brethren, obedient to myne elders, louing to all sortes, degrées, enuious to no man, but framing my lyfe vprightly and my conuersation orderly, honestly, my doinges circumspectly, vertuously, hauing thy feare before myne eyes, in all my thoughtes, deedes, and words, when Ilie downe, and when ryse vp, at my last and euer more Amen, prayer before the receauing of the communio~.
Swéet Iesu, the Sonne of the euerliuing God, yu gauest thy body, to be cruelly tormented, to the death, to deliuer and redeme me most miserable wretched sinner, yt by ye lawe was dead in iniquitie, subiecte to the misery of eternall damnation: haue mercy vpo~ me, poore miserable wretch, whome the multitud of myne offences doeth, so terrifie, and driue into such méere desperation, that dare not once looke vp vpon the brightnes of thy glory, nor presume to present my selfe before thy deuine Maiestie, in hope to obtayne remission of my sinnes, but depending onely vpo~ a sure faith in thee, my Lord and Sauiour by whose death and passion, am assuredly informed by faith, that am fréely iustified, with absolute remission of all myne offences.
Wherefore most humbly appeale vnto thy Throne of mercy, crying with the Publicanne, Lorde haue mercy vpo~ me, thy mercy pardon my faltes, bynde vp my woundes, and poure in thy sweet oyle, like a good Samaritan, whereby may be purified, and purged, from those naughty tares of sinne, which haue plowed me, euen as a shadowe, foloweth the body, from the verye instant of my Natiuitie.
come as an abiecte wretch, and reprobate to thée yt art the mediator and intercessor, to reconcile me, to thy Father, (from whose sauoure fell for transgression of his co~maundement, in my greate Grandfather Adam:) moste humbly desiring thee, to heale myne infirmitie, and sickenes to washe away my sinne, and filthynes, to illuminate my blyndenes, to conduct me to the right way, that nowe wander in the wide dessert of error, to comfort mee, destitute of all helpe and goodnes.
confesse most swéete Sauiour, that am but earth and ashes, a confused Chaos, and lumpe of sinne and of my selfe not worthy to loke vp toward heauen, much lesse to presume vnto thy holy table, to the communication of that most blessed Sacrement of thy body, whereof whosoeuer eateth worthylie, with a stedfast and inmoueable fayth in thee, hath euerlasting lyfe: but whosoeuer eateth thereof vnworthily, (as Iudas dyd,) eateth his owne dampnation, Therefore although come lyke an vncleane sinner, be polluted both in body yet reposinge my whole fayth, and confidence in the merites of thy passio~ haue presumed to come to thy table, to be made partaker of that vnspeakeable bente of thy death, feedinge outwardly vpon materyall bread, but inwardly by faith vpon thy blessed bodye: the bread representing a perfect figure and remembraunce, of thy bodie, and the wyne, of thy bloud, whiche was shed vpon the Crosse for my redemptio~.
Geue me grace sweete Iesu, to confesse my sinnes wyth the Publicane, and to crye, Lord be mercifull to me a sinner: and yt with Mary Magdeline, may washe thy feete with ye teares of repentaunce, geue me grace, to reconcile my selfe to my brother, while he is in the waye, to examyne mine owne consience, and if in ought haue offended any man, first of all to desire forgeuenesse at the hands of thy deuine Maiestie, and next of him whome haue trespassed: my selfe to forgeue all men, whatsoeuer they haue done, said, or imagined agaynst mée, euen as hope to haue remission at thy Fathers handes, of all myne offences, by the merites of thy pretious deathe and passion.
Geue me grace to serch my conscience so narowly, that if any one doe stycke in my mynde, may humbly confesse it, before the feete of thy mercy, crauing pardon therof, with grace necessary to leaue a newe lyfe.
That with a pe hart, and cleare co~science, confessing my sins from ye bottome of my hart, maye this daye, receaue ye Sacrament of thy precious body and bloud, to my soules health, that thou from henceforth mayst dwell in me, in thee for euer, whereby may obtayne, and attaine to that longe desired marke, whereto the race of all true Christians tendeth, that is euerlasting lyfe, in that heauenly Ierusalem, where all the elect Saintes shall liue for euermore, worlde wythout end.
In the meane vntill it shall seeme good to thy to abridge ye course of my dayes in this lyfe, humbly desire thée, (moste sweete Sauiour,) to admit me to the co~munion of thy Supper, that may be worthy to be accompted a member of thy mysticall bodie here in earth, among ye num+ber of thy chosen Sayntes, in thy congregation.
And after the receit of thy body, bloud, vouchsafe thée, to illuminate the eyes of my hart with the light of thy heauenly spirit, that Satha~ enter not into me, as he did into Iudas, but graunt that the rest of my lyfe may be so ordred, that sinne may be subdued in me, thy glory aduaunced, thy faith embraced, and thy holy commaundementes studiously followed, through the merites of thy passion.
Render moste hartie and infinite thankes, vnto thée, swéete Iesu, for thyne vnspeakable goodnesse, because thou hast fed me this day wt thy most pretious bodie, and bloude, in the wherby am iustified by an inmoueable and constante fayth in thy grace and passion, being made an vndefiled member of thy church.
Temple for the holy Ghost, and a fellow heire or partaker in thy glorious kingdome, in the bosome of Abraham, where the spirites of the elect shall rest for euermore.
Graunt therfore sweet Iesu, that this Sacrame~t which haue receaued, may through the operation of the holy Ghost, be to mee a purgation, and clensing of all my sinnes, a spirituall stre~gthe agaynst my boly frailtie, a preparature, and preseruature against ye te~ptatyons of Sathan, a bridle, mean of restraint against ye vntamed lusts of the flesh a defence against worldly troubles and aduersitie, and finally a perfect medicine of lyfe, and a continuall of thy blessed passion: by meanes wherof stande in assured hope of eternall saluation, with frée iustification, and remission of all my sinnes.
So that it may conduct and guyde me in the way, and when am out of the way, it maye reduce me, whe~ slide it may vpholde me, when fall it may rayse me vp agayne: when liue, it maye bée a salue to my soule: when am weake it maye stre~gthe~ and confirme: when am in darkenes, it may illuminate me, wyth the light of true fayth, and vnderstanding.
Let ye receauing thereof excuse so effectuall an operation in my hart, that neuer ioye in other comfort but in thée, that neuer féele other sweetenes but thee, yt neuer seke other place of refuge but thée, yt my mynd be enamoured vpo~ no other louer but thée, that séeke for no other succoure but at thée, thát trust in none other but in thée, myne onely Lorde and redemer, who didest not denie, to haue thy moste pretious body scourged, and mangled, and thy bloud to be shed most aboun+dantly, for my sake: whereby might be brought from errour, to trueth, from ignoraunce, to vndersta~ding fro~ darkenes, to light, from vanitie, to veritie, from mortalitie, to immortallitie, corruption to incorruption, from damnatio~ to iustification, from eternall death, to the inco~prehensible ioyes of eternall and saluation· To thee swéete Iesus, wyth the Father, the holy Ghost be all honour, glory from thys tyme forthe for euer more, worlde without ende.
prayer to be said whe~ ye take a iourney by lande.
Almighty Lord, most mercifall father, ye wachman of them that sleepe, the Physicion of them that are diseased, the comfort of the~ that are afflicted, the garder and protector of them that are in any daunger, or aduersity, vouchsafe, besech thée, to sende downe thyne heauenly Aungell, to be my guide, conductor, and leader, in the waye where walke that by thy gracious protection, may be defended fro~ all myne enemies, bothe Ghostly and bodily, from all perills, or daungers, yt by any extraordinary meanes may be fall me, if be alone without company, kepe my mynde free, from all maner idle phantasies, and fonde that may withdrawe me from the meditation of thy heauenly word, and let al my thoughts consist in the contemplation of thy comfortable promises, and co~maundementes.
And if it so chaunce that trauayle in the companie of others, beseche thee, so to direct my tonge, that no word of ribaldrie, or vnhonest talke proceede out of my mouth, but that al my communications, thoughts, and déedes, may tend to the aduauncement of thy glorie, and to the edification both of me, and all els that shall heare it.
Send downe, most heauenly Father, thy messenger to conduct me, as thou dydst yong Iobias in his iourney to Rages, whiche moste mercifully defended him from the iawes of the monstrous Fishe, and from the power of the euil spirit.
Thou hast promised, that thou wylt at all tymes be readie both to heare their prayers, and minister present helpe to all them, that vnfaignedly call vppon thy name: encline therefore thine eare vnto me, moste mercifull Father, whiche powre foorth my prayers, before ye throne of thy mercie, and vouchsafe to garde me vnder the shadow of thy winges, that may safely trauaile in trade of my vocation, without daunger of anye ghostly enimie, that may hurt the soule, or anye other humaine chaunce, or casualtie, that may annoye the body.
Direct, most mercyfull Father, the procse of my businesse to a happie and prosperous ende, that may returne with as good and perfect helth, both of bodie and soule, as take my iourney: so will prayse thée, in the congregation of ye righteous, with a Psalme of thankes geuing to thy name, for euer and euer.
prayer to be sayde when ye make a voyage by sea.
Almightie Lorde, and most mercifull Father, maker of al thinges, who by thine insearcheable wysedome dyddest create that mightie globe of the world, the heauens, earth, sea, and all things els therin conteyned: vouchsafe beseeche thée to be mine aide, and defence, in this daungerous viage, whiche haue presumed to take, reposing mine only trust and confidence in thy mercie, to be deliuered and preserued from all maner daungers, and ieopardies, that may happe~ either vpon the sea or on the drye lande.
Thou knowest most mercifull Father, that all those that trauayle by sea, are subiect to the hazarde of diuers calamities, eyther to be tossed at the pleasure of the winde and waues, either to be dashed violently vpon the mayne rockes, or to sticke in ye quicke sandes, or to be dispoyled both of lyfe, and goodes, by the tyrannie of Pyrates.
But yet what crosse or affliction so euer happen vnto me, muste acknowledge fréely, yt it is but a iust punishme~t for mine offences, because from the firste house of my natiuitie, haue been more apt and prone, to folowe the filthy of mine own desires, then to exercise my+self in the way of thine vndefiled lawe.
Notwithstanding, what crosse soeuer thou shalt thinke good to lay vpon me, yea, although were deuoured of ye waues, and swallowed downe into the deapth of the Whales bellie, yet wil not dispaire of thy mercie, for thou art the same God for euer, thy right hand is not shortned, neyther is the greatnesse of thy power diminyshedde, Whe~ lay thrée dayes and thrée nyghtes in the Whales bellie, yet diddest thou at last deliuer him safe and sounde, and sent him to preach thy name to ye great citie of Niniue.
Thou art yet the same God, thou wast at ye time, neither is thy power abridged at all.
Although were neuer so shaken with wyndes, turmoyled with tempestes, tossed with the waues, yea although were vtterlye deuoured of the Whale, yet art thou able to deliuer me from all these daungers, yea, from the very iawes of death.
To thée therfore do make my supplicatio~s, to thée do powre foorth my prayers, for thou onely art the castle of my comfort, my bulwarke, my watchman, my keeper, my defender, the sure rocke and hope of my saluation.
To only it belongeth to direct my course safelye into the haue~, to protect and saue me fro~ the crueltie of ye water, to leade me forth, to bri~g me in, to be my onely stay defence, whether sléepe or wake, liue or die, sincke or swim, vpon the waters, as wel as vpo~ the land, briefly in all places, in al times and seasons.
Thou knowest (most merciful father) that this trade is not of my deuising, nor yet procéeding of any humaine inuention: but thou of thy mere mercy, didst reueale the mysterie therof to thy seruaunt Noe, in commaundyng hym to frame an Arke, that myght fléete vpon the floods, wherin he and his familie onely were saued, when all the worlde els, for the greatnes of iniquitie perished altogether, and were vtterly confounded in the waters.
Graunt therfore most mercyfull Father, that this voyage, whiche haue presumed to take onely vppon a sure fayth, affiaunce in thy mercy, may turne me to no damage, or misfortune, but that may be safely conducted, both foorth and home agayne, by thy merciful protection, and assistance.
So wyl yéelde thee immortal prayses, for thy fatherly benefites, and my tongue shal recorde the workes of thy glory, for euer euer.
Yet, (Father) not my wyll, but thy wyll be fulfilled.
To thée with thy sonne Iesus Christ, and the holy Ghoste, thrée persons and one God, be all honour and glory, for euermore.
Render vnto thée immortall thankes, most mercyfull Father, for the swéete sléepe, and comfortable rest that thou of thy mercy hast geuen me this night to recreate my wery limmes of the continuall labours, and trauayles, whiche was borne to susteyne.
And for as muche, as thou hast commaunded me by thy holye worde, to redeeme the time, and alwayes to be exercised in some good worke, and neuer to spende the tyme in idlenesse, most humbly beseche thee, that thou wylt vouchsafe to looke vpon me, with the eyes of thy mercy, and by the illumination and inspiration of thy heauenly spirite, so to direct all my counsayles, laboures, and studies, that beyng replenished with thy grace, may so spende this day according to thy most blessed wyl and ordinaunce, that may circumspectly shunne, and eschewe all suche wayes as may prouoke, or kyndle thy displeasure agaynst me, or that in anye respect, maye tende to my neyghboures da~mage.
Geue me grace, to remoue the vayle of vanitie out of my hart, that maye alwayes haue thy feare before myne eyes, lyuing honestly, and vprightly in my callyng, aboundyng in all maner good workes, proceding from a sounde and vncorrupt fayth, that my conuersation maye be founde pure before thée, without either spot or blemishe, my liuing maye be temperate, modest, with mediocritie, not sauouring of anye incontinencie, or immoderate superfluitie: whereby all my doinges maye be acceptable before thy diuine maiestie, to the prayse and glorye of thy moste blessed name.
Styrre vp my mind continually, to haue thy promises, and benefites in remembraunce, that all my thoughtes, and cogitations, may be exercised in the consyderation of them, and not fallyng backewarde to my wonted iniquitie, as the dogge vseth to returne againe to his vomite, or the sowe that hath bene cleane washed to wallowe agayne in the myre.
Geue me continuall quietnesse of minde, without anye vexation or sting of conscience, that maye haue some taste, and féeling of thy euerlasting ioyes, that these dregges, chaffe of the worlde maye séeme lothsome, and fylthy vnto me, in comparison of those heauenlye pleasures, that are prepared for the elect since the foundation of the worlde.
To which ioyes we besech thée (most mercyfull father) to bryng vs, for Iesus Christe his sake: To whom, &c.
ALmyghtie moste mercyful Father, whiche at the creatour of all thynges, diddest by thy heaue~ly wisdome ordayne the daye for man to trauayle in, and to exercise him selfe in the laboures parteyning to the trade of his vocation: and the night for vs to re from our dayly laboures, and to refreshe our fraile bodyes, with some sweete and naturall sleepe, whereby we myght be ye better enabled, euery man to laboure in his calling, and profession according to thy holy wil, and commaundements: Uouchsafe we beseeche thée (moste merciful father) that we thy poore pylgrimes, that dayly trauayle in runnyng this our earthly race, in hope to winne the crowne of euerlasting glorie, by ye merites of Christe Iesus, may enioy continuall health of body, soule this night euer, and that we maye be preserued from al temptations of Sathan, who is euer redy, whe~ we be idle, to seduce vs fro~ thée our Sauiour, into the broade way of euerlastyng death and
And whe~soeuer our bodies take their naturall rest, yet our myndes maye be alwayes bent and fixed vpon thée, the eyes of our vnderstanding, may alwaies watch in thee, that art our onely Lord and moste mercyfull defender.
Geue vs grace, whensoeuer we lye downe, euery nyght to examine our conscience, and enter into accompte of those déedes, whiche we haue done the daye before, and all the rest of our lyfe tyme.
And if we finde, that we haue done any good déed, geue vs grace to ascribe the same to thée, that art the only fountayne and author of al goodnesse, and to acknowledge fréely our imperfection, howe that of our selues, we are not able to thinke so muche as one good thought, muche lesse to do any good or godly action, that shoulde seeme to procéede of our owne forwardnesse, or aptnesse thereunto: for we are nothing els but sinne corruption: and then howe shoulde an euyll trée bring foorth good fruite? Agayne, if we finde that we haue sinned agaynst thée, eyther in thought, word, or deede, (as we do seuentie tymes seuen tymes euery day:) geue vs grace, most merciful father, to acknowledge if before thy diuine maiestie, with the teares of earnest vnfaigned repentance, to craue thy mercy with forgeuenes both of that, and all other crimes and offences, which we haue co~mitted againste thée since the tyme of our byrth.
Or els if we finde that we haue by any meanes enda~maged our neyghbour, geue vs grace to reco~cile our selues, and to cleare our conscience, before we lye downe, wherby we may sléepe both swéetly, soundly, in Christ Iesus, without any idle cogitatio~s, or phantasticall dreames, that may disturbe our myndes from the meditatio~ of thy word: and yf we dreame at all, let vs dreame of thée our mercyfull Father: and such godly lessons and precepts that we haue séene sléeping, to folow prosecute the same actually, waking.
Render vnto thée, (moste mercyfull father) immortall thankes for that thou of thy mere mercye and Fatherly bountie hast graunted this night past to be prosperous and healthfull vnto me, without any perturbation eyther of body or soule.
And because thou hast promised by the mouth of thy holye prophetes, that thou wylt heare my voyce, wh~soeuer call vppon thée by faith with humble supplications, and repentance of my sinnes: beseche thée lykewise, that thou wylt so prosper all myne actions, and indeuours this present day, that al thinges that do say or thinke, may redeunde to thy glorie, to the commoditie of my neighbour, to the dammage of no man whatsoeuer, neyther in thought, worde, nor déede: but that all my doinges maye be directed by thy gouernance, to eschewe sinne, to doe that is righteous in thy sight, at all tymes, in all places, and in al respectes, to haue a reuerent feare of thée before mine eies, to walke circum+spectly and so vprightly in my vocation, to put of the person of Adam, and to put on the newe man, to order my conuersation agreable to thy wyll, to serue thée in spirite and trueth, with the sacrifice of thankes geuing, and contritio~ of hart, to lay sure holde on the anker of fayth, with an vndoubted, and stedfast hope of resurrection to eternall life.
myne eyes moste mercyfull Father, with the beames of thy heauenly spirite, that walke not in darknesse, as the children of vnbeliefe do, which haue no hope to arise from the dead.
Geue me grace to abandon all worldly carefulnesse, to tame myne owne lustes, affections, to do ye thing that is right, and diligently to walke in the light of thy co~maundementes: For thou onely art the true light, thou knowest no going downe, thou art God from euerlasting, world without end.
Encrease most merciful father, the gift of faith, that may truely beleue in thée, in thy promises made vnto me, and that neither by my neglige~ce, nor by my infirmitie of the fleshe, nor by greatnes of temptation, neither by the subtill craftes, assaultes of the deuil, may be driuen from faith in the blood of my sauiour Christe Iesus.
Strengthen (moste mercifull Father) my féeble nature against all assaultes of the worlde, the flesh, and ye deuil, that may alwaies haue a sure co~fidence in thy onely mercie, neuer to start away fro~ thy grace to seeke for helpe of man, but continually to cleaue to the multitude of thy mercies, who art able to exalt the humble and meeke, to pull downe the mighty from the throne of their pompe and glorie Geue me grace to haue thee in minde, whatsoeuer doe to honor thee, to feare thee, to cal vpon thy name, when am in trouble, and to repose my whole truste in the greatnesse of thy power and mercy, with an assured hope to be preserued from all perils, both bodily, and ghostly, and at the laste when haue ended my race in this transitorie pylgrimage, to obtaine the crowne of euerlasting ioye, and felicitie, in that celestiall Ierusalem, whiche thou haste prepared for all them that feare thy name, since the creation of the worlde, throuh Iesus Christe our sauiour, Amen.
Almightie most mercifull father, acknowledge and co~fesse, that am not worthy to lift vp mine eyes towarde heauen, much+lesse to presume to prese~t mi+selfe before thy diuine maiestie, being but earth and asshes, a lumpe of sinne and iniquitie, subiect to death corruption, if enter into examination of mine owne desertes: for ye infinite multitude of mine offe~ces beare witnes against me, that by mine owne workes am vnder the dreadfull curse of the lawe, and in extreme danger of euerlasting death and damnation: for in sinne was begotte~, and in sinne hath my mother conceaued me, confesse that there is no goodnesse in me, but ani apt forwarde inclination, to eschewe the good, and to folowe the euill: to raunge after ye lustes of mine owne desires, to wander astraye out of the way of righteousnesse, and my dayly disobedience, to kindle thy wrath, heauie displeasure against me, and contiqually to heape sinne vpon sinne, to runne a madding after the phantasies of mine owne minde, and neuer to harken to the voyce of thy co~maundements.
Yet this one comfort haue I, yt Iesus Christ, by his pretious death and bloodsheddyng, hath payde the raunsome of my iniquitie, made a ful agrement, and perfect attonement betwene God and man, being a continuall intercessor for me, and a moste louing mediator betwixt his father me, to appease his furie, and to receaue me into his fauour againe.
Therfore most merciful father, séeing thou haste not denied to geue vp thine onely begotten sonne, to the shameful death of the crosse, to redéeme me from the bondage of death, hell: Inspire beseche thée my minde with thy heaue~ly spirite, that maye doe suche thinges as please thee, and turne to kill sinne, with all other vngodly lustes concupiscence, that maye be made a sweete smelling sacrifice to thee, and the temple of ye holy ghost for euer, that may liue vprightly and honestly in my calling, without reproofe, ensuing ye right pathe of thy holy commaundementes.
And for as muche as it hath pleased thee to ordaine the night for men to rest in, and the day to labour, graunt beseche thee most merciful Father, that may so take my bodily rest, that my soule may continually watche for that happie and ioyfull tyme, when Iesus Christ shal appeare for my deliueraunce out of the miseries of this transitorie lyse.
And in the meane season that be not ouercome by any pha~tasies, dreames or other temptations, but maye haue my minde, alwaye fixed vppon thee, to loue thee, feare thee, and rest in thee for euer: Moreouer that my sleepe be not excessiue, or ouermuche after the vnsatiable desyres of the fleshe, but so much as maye suffise to content and satisfie my feeble nature, wherby may be the better disposed to lyue in al godlye conuersation, to the glory of thy holy name, and the commoditie of my neyghbour.
To thee with the sonne and the holy ghost, be al honor glory for euer euer.
Almightie most merciful father, haue pitie, and compassion vppon the weakenesse of me thy vnworthy chylde, and be thou prest, and redy (O heauenly father) to helpe me, with thy heauenly spirit to assist my weake spirite, againste all assaultes of the wicked worlde, the fleshe, and the deuyll, whiche striue continually with fayre allurementes and prouocations to drawe my mynde from thy commaundementes, into the hartfull and damnable way of error, and iniquitie: but myne only stay and co~fidence is in the multitude of thy mercies, with a sure and certayne hope, that thou wylt so direct my steppes, both this day, and euer hereafter, that all my thoughtes, words, deedes, may be found acceptable in thy sight, and accordyng to the godly liue and rule of thy vndefiled lawe.
Therefore beseech thee (heauenly father) to shewe thy mercy vpon me, and to prosper me in whatsoeuer goe about in thy name: so that thou geuyng me lyght, may learne to knowe what thinges are acceptable before thee, and by the vertue of thy grace, may haue an earnest yeale, desyre to folow the same in my life, to glory, the commoditie of my neighbour.
That thou being my guide and leader, may walke in the path of vnderstanding, and righteousnesse without stumbling or wandring astray: for in my selfe haue nothing but mistrust, and inabilitie to do any thing, yt maye please thée, sauing only by the motion of thy holy spirit in my mind, which spirit assureth my spirite, that the meane to please thée, is a constant and immoueable fayth in Christe Iesus, with repentaunce of my sinnes, and amendment of lyfe, to ensue the steppes of equitie, and vnderstanding: to cleaue to ye stedfast rocke, of thy heauenly worde, and promises, to loue my neighbour as my selfe, for hereby shall it be knowen that we be thy childre~, if we loue one another: to geue ouer my portion to ye poore, to take vp my crosse, and folowe thée, to abounde in all maner good workes, whiche are the fruites of fayth in Christe Iesu.
Geue me grace, most mercyful father, to kyll the buddes of sinne in my fleshe, to bridle myne owne destres, to kepe my body in subiectio~, wherby maye be sanctified in thee, and made an vndefiled ple for the holy ghost, ful of the spirite of trueth and vnderstanding.
And sith it hath pleased thee of thy fatherly pitie to preserue me from all perils daungers, both of body and soule, this night, and al the rest of my lyfe tyme, tyll this present houre, beseeche thee also most merciful father, to protect me with thy grace, all this daye, euer hereafter, that may safely walke in my vocatio~, with thy feare before myne eyes, in all things that take in hand.
And vouchsafe most mercyfull father, so to direct the re~nant of my course, which haue yet to runne in this lyfe, that at the laste may come to dwell with thée, in thy euerlasting kingdome, and there to haue fruition of eternall ioye and felicitie: through Iesus Christe, our onely mediatour sauiour.
Mercyfull Lorde Iesu, beseche thée to be fauourable to me, a wretched sinner, that all my lyfe tyme, haue folowed the lustes of myne owne minde, and neuer harkened to thy voyce, wherby might liue in thy lawe, that thou hast appointed for me.
Put away beseeche thée, all my sinnes out of thy remembrance, washe me cleane wt thy pretious blood, sanctifie me with thy bitter passion and death, clense me throughly, restore me agayne to the innocencie, whiche thou gauest me in baptisme, that may be truely regenerate, borne a newe in thée my swéet sauiour only redeemer, so yt maye acknowledge thée onely the author of my redemption, and the principal cause of my iustification: to shew my a thankefull Samaritane, for that thou hast vouchsafed, by thy death and bloodshedding, to purge me from the leprosie of sinne, and al kinde of vncleannesse: yeelding thée immortal thanks continually, for that all other gratious benefites, which thou of thy fatherly liberalitie, bountie, vouchsafest dayly to bestow vpon me.
And among all the rest geue me grace, swéet Iesu, to haue alwaies in remembra~ce thy sincere loue, fatherly affection, and gratious charitie towardes me, in that thou hast vouchsafed to take my nature vpon thée, to be made man in all respectes lyke vnto me, (sinne onely excepted) and for my sake to be borne in a stable, and as an infant to be wrapped in clothes, to be swadled, laide in a maunger, there to be fed with the materiall milke of thy blessed mother, the virgin Marie.
For my sake sweet Iesu, thou hast susteyned hunger, colde, pouertie, and many other agonies didst thou susteyne for me, most miserable and wretched sinner.
Thou hast suffered thy selfe to be betrayed, to be apprehended, and taken shamefully, to be bounde vnworthyly, to be beaten cruelly, to be condemned vniustly, and to be brought to that shameful death of the crosse, where for my sake thy pretious bodye was rent, and torne, and thy moste sweete blood aboundauntly shedde, where thou yéeldedst vp the ghost to God the father, and descendedst agayne into the graue, lyke a dead man, but dyddest ryse agayne the thirde daye, and ascendedst into heauen, where thou sittest at ye right hande of God the father, from whence we looke for thy co~ming again, to iudge the quicke and the dead, at what tyme we sta~d in assured hope, to be made ioyntly possessours felowe heyres in thy kingdome, in eternall ioy for euer.
Therfore swéete Iesu, seing thou haste not spared thy owne pretious body, but gauest it vp as a sweete smelling sacrifice on the aulter of the crosse, therby so redeme me from death, and to make a full satisfaction for my offences: direct, besech thee, my so in this lyfe, yt maye be worthy of that wherunto thou hast called me, to haue an especial and regarde of thy commaundementes, and to folowe them as nearely as can, in all trueth singlenesse of hart, to yeelde obedience to my betters, to labour paynefullye, and at tymes conuenient in my trade, and at night when lye downe to recreate my bodye after my daylye labours, geue me grace to co~fesse my sinnes vnto thée, to implore thy mercye, with the teares of vnfaigned repentaunce.
And though my limmes take their naturall rest, yet let my minde continually watche in thee, exspectyng that ioyfull daye, when shalbe made partaker of thy celestiall ioyes, which shall neuer ende, To thee sweete Iesus, with the father, and the holye ghost, be all honor.
Almightie, moste mercyfull father, hartyly beseeche thee, vouchsafe to looke downe, with the eyes of thy mercy vpo~ me, a most vile and miserable sinner, whiche lye here prostrate before the feete of thy mercy, crauing remission of my manifolde sinnes and wickednesse, from the very bottome of my hart, acknowledging freely, that am no more worthy to be called thy sonne, the multitude of myne offences is so great infinite.
Yet for asmuch as thou art the god and Father of all comfort which desirest not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should tourne from his wickednesse and liue: and like a true pitifull Samaritan art sory to sée me+ly thus wounded wyth the sting of sinne and iniquitie, make me pray thée, by infusion of thy comfortable oyle into my wou~ds, to run repentantly with the lost Sonne, and vnfaynedly to bewaile myne offences at ye féete of thy mercy, crying, Father, haue sinned against heauen, and agaynst thee, am no more worthy to bee called thy Sonne, make mee as one of thy hired seruants.
Geue me grace, alwaies to repent my sinnes with a co~+trite hart before thy deuine Maiestie, wythout eyther dissemblinge, or cloking of them, for thou art the god of light, thou séest whatsoeuer is donne in darkenesse, and from thy eyes there can bée nothing co~cealed: haue mercy therefore (most mercifull Father) vppon me, forgeue me my trespasses, as forgeue them that haue trespassed against me: forgeue me my debt, and haue compassio~ vpon myne infirmitie, for thou Lorde art a mercyfull God, full of pitie compassion such a one, as is sory for my afflictions, with thée is aboundaunce of comfort, plentie, of redemption, thou onely art ye god of my health and saluation: besides thee knowlege none other god, neyther in heaue~ aboue, nor the earth beneth, neyther in the water vnder ye earth, tho~ onely art almighty, thou onely from the beginning art euerlasting, world without ende.
bowe downe thine eares (most mercifull Father) to the voyce of my lamentatio~, for against thée onely haue sinned, thée only haue offended, and iustly for my disobedience prouoked thy wrath, and indignotion against mée, yet poore sinner doe accuse my selfe vnto thée, deare Father that haue sore greuousely offended thy goodnesse Maiestie, in committing of diuers manifold haynouse offences against thée, for haue not kepte the least of thy most holy and godly co~maundeme~ntes, but haue wandred astraye from my youth, folowing myne owne vnbrideled affections, declining fro~ ye sacred precepts of thy holie lawe, and starting aside like a broke~ bowe haue not honoured thée lyke my god, haue not thée like my Father, haue not serued thee like my creator, but haue all my life tyme spurned at the waye of righteousnesse, and vnderstanding, offending thy diuine Maiestie euer both in thoughts, words, and dedes, whiche continually co~mit against thée, my merciful God and louing Sauiour, am sory for my sinnes, euen from the bottom of my hart, yea my soule mourneth most mercyfull Father, to the death, for the innumerable multitude of my sins.
The onely hope haue of obtayning thy mercy, is in the merites of thy Sonne Iesus Christ, my Sauiour.
Thou hast diuers and sundry tymes by the mouth of thy holy Prophetes, pronou~ced forgeuenesse of sinnes, if repent from the bottome of my hart, vouchsafe therefore most mercifull Father, to looke vpon my misery, as thou sparest thy plague from the great Citie of Niniue, when they repented: euen so most mercifull father withdrawe thy rod fro~ mée, that lye prostrate at ye feete of thy mercie, bewailinge my sinnes wyth the vnfayned lamentation of hartye repentaunce.
Forgeue mée my offences, most mercifull Father, and renue a right spirit within me, co~duct me by the vertue of thy grace, to run ye rest of this earthly course which yet remaineth that my footesteppes neuer slyde: but that may so spe~d this day, (to the beginning whereof thou haste safely brought me) and the re~nant of my lyfe in thys world yt all my thoughtes, wordes, and works, may tend to thy glory, and to the co~moditie of my neighbour, so that may haue a ioyfull resurrection at what tyme thy Sonne Iesus Christ my sauiour, shall come to iudge both the quicke and ye deade.
To whome with thée and ye holy Ghost be all honor and glory for euer and euer.
prayer for Thursday euening. &c. Lorde, whiche onely art god, true gratious mercyfull, which commaundest them that loue thy name to cast all their feare and care vpon thée, promysing most mercifully, thy selfe to bée their protectour from theyr enemies, their refuge in da~ger, their gouernour in the daye, their watchman in ye night, who kéepest Israell, doest neither slumber nor sléepe, but hast thyne eyes contineuallie bent vpon the~ as the egle on her you~geons protecting them vnder the shadowe of thy power, as the henne gathereth her chickens to geather, couering them vnder the shadowe of her winges: besech thee of thy bountifull goodnesse Lorde, to forgeue me my sinnes wherein haue offe~ded thee this day, and heretofore in my lyfe tyme, and to receaue me vnder thy protection this night and euer, that may rest in perfect quietnesse both of body soule.
Graunt most mercifull Father, that the externall eyes of my bodie maye take their sound and naturall sléepe, but let the inward eyes of my hart and mynde continually watch vnto thée that the weakenesse of the slesh cause me not to offende thy diuine Maiestie.
Let my mynd at all tymes haue an inward feelynge of thy goodnesse towards me, that the memory of thy manyfold benefites neuer slyde out of my remembraunce, but that at all tymes may be styrred vp to prayse thy name, to yeld thee thankes for the innumerable gyftes that thou of thy méere mercy and Fatherly liberalitie, without any desart of mine hast fréely bestowed vpon me, since the first houre of my natiuitie.
Let thy praise sound in my mouth, late earely, at midday and midnight, in all places, at all tymes and seasons.
Plant in my hart most mercyfull Father, a true desire perfect zeale to thanke thee, for all the that haue daylie receaued at thy ha~ds, that may tourne backe wt ye Samaritan, prayse thee, and not to depart as ye other ix. Lepiers did, who feeling themselues clensed of their filthynesse, yet returned not at all to geue God thankes Instruct me besech thée in thy diuine iudgements that when haue safely passed this nighte vnder thy protection, may spend ye next day, all my lyfe folowing in holynesse and puritie of conuersation, crying co~tinually, come Lord Iesu, come, for thyne electes sake, come quickly, Amen.
That at the last maye happilie ariue at the port of that euerlastinge rest, whiche by thy mercy thou hast promised to all the~ that vnfaynedly loue ye name of Iesu: To whom with the Father, and the holy Ghost be all honor and glory for euer.
ALmighty and most mercifull Father, besech thée for thy Sonne Iesus Christe his sake, to graunt me thy heauenly grace that with immoueable zeale may séeke after those things that may please thée, circomspectly shunne all kinde of wayes that maye moue or prouake thy wrathe against me.
And when haue once knowe~ perfectly what thy will pleasure is, geue me grace to séeke the same carefully, to fulfill it perfectly, and to walke in the same vigelantly, to the honor and glory of thy most holy name Order my lyuinge so that may doe those things which thou requirest of me, that with vnfained deuotio~ wyth+out all pharisicall prete~ded holynesse.
Geue me grace that maye know it, haue will and power to doo thereafter, least if knowe my maister his will and due it not, be beaten with many stripes.
Aboue all thinges geue me grace to seeke thy honour and glory, wyth all thinges else which he moste conuenient for my saluatio~ in Christe Iesu. Make my beseche thee moste mercyfull Father, sure and straight before, that if welth abound fall not vnto pride and presumption, or if fall into aduersitie be not driuen into desperation, as to loase ye fayth whiche haue in my Lord and Sauiour, or to blaspheme thy most ho+ly mame with words of reproch as they doo, whose hart Sathan hath possessed, and rooted the séedes of vertue vnderstandinge out of their harts.
Onely geue me a necessary liuinge, sufficient to maintayne my selfe honestly, wyth mediocritie, and without superfluitie or idle excesse.
Geue mée not to much, lest wax proude so forget thée, that art ye author of my welth and mine onely vpholder: neyther to littell lest bée forced to attempt, vnhonest and extraordinary shiftes, without any care or respect eyther thy heauenly lawes and commaundeme~ts, or the decrées of my prince and countrie.
Geue me grace euer to reioyce in thée, and that may neuer be sorowfull for any thinge, but that may drawe me from thy lawe, or wherin haue sinned against thy diuine Maiestie.
Bée thou myne onely comforte aboue all other, to recreate me whe~ am in perplexitie, to protect me both at my down li+inge and vprysinge, let mee not be mery with the ioye that is without thee, neyther let me delite in any thinge but in thee, and the crosse of Christ Iesu: make me to lift vp myne harte continually to thee, when am eyther in prosperitie or fallen into aduersatie.
Make me humble without ipocrisie, mery without lightnesse, sad with+out mistrust, sober without dulnesse, true without dou blenesse, fearinge thee without desperation, trusting in thée wythout presumption, teling my neybour his falts without dissimulation, geuing other a good example of perfect and godly lyuinge, yt they which behold it may be the more enflamed to trend the like trace and to glorifiy god in all his gyftes.
And finallie graunt most mercyfull Father that séeinge (I haue taken sufficient reste this night past, and that the day is come) wherein thou hast appoynted me to doe all suche godly and necessarie businesse, as may be to thy glory, ye profit of my neyghbour and health of my soule: maye so passe the same in thy feare, that be in daunger of no trouble or perturbatio~ of body or minde but euermore constante in fayth by the bloud of Christ Iesus my Sauiour and redeemer.
To whome with thée ye holy ghost be all honor and glory for euer and euer.
Render vnto thée, (moste mercifull Father, all possible thankes and prayses, for that thou of thy méere mercy and Fatherly pitie, hast garded me all this day, and the rest of my life time vnder ye winges of thy heauenly protection: desyringe thée with the teares of my lamentation to put all my wickednes out of thy minde which haue committed agaynst thy diuine Maiestie sith the tyme of my conception Thou haste promysed by the mouth of thy holye Prophet that at what time soeuer a sinner doth repente him of his sinnes from the bottome of his harte, thou wilt put all his wickednesse out of thy remembraunce: forgeue me therefore moste mercyfull Father, and with the eyes of thy mercy looke down vpon me as thou diddest loke vpon Peter thyne Apostle when hée lamented his sinne was sory for his offences, let me be regenerate in spirit, and learne fro~ henceforth to walke in thy lawes all the dayes of my lyfe. Make me to lifte mine hart often tymes vnto thée, and when fall make me to thinke vpon thee and be sory for mine iniquity with stedfast purpose of amendme~t grace of thée, to performe the same.
Graunte me vnderstandinge to knowe thy will to folowe suche conuersation as may please thee, to repose my whole trust and confidence in the multitude of thy mercies, whereby may walke without blame in my calling, doing right to euery man, and iniury to no man, but after the example of thy Son Iesus Christ to suffer wronge patiently without desire of reuenge, to pray for mine enimies, to loue them that persecute my lyfe, Graunte grace in all kynde of humilitie to folowe ye steppes of thy sonne Iesus Christ, that pure and immaculate Lambe.
And when my body hath taken his naturall rest geue me a desire to shake of all slouthfulnesse and drousinesse, that my lims may be stronge to sustayne my laboures, that pertayne to my present, vocation, and that all mine accions maye bee done in thy name, and referred to thy glory, to the commoditie of the co~mon welth.
Almighty Lord moste mercyfull Father, whose power reacheth aboue the cloudes, thy glory through all the world, who onely beholdest the counsels, deuises and workes, yea the very thoughtes of all men, that serchest the inward cogitations, yea the very hart and raynes.
most humbly besech thée, that for as muche as thou hast graciously preserued me this night, may not spend this day after my owne mynde and pleasure whiche is alway euill and wicked, but earnestly looke vpon and diligently folowe thy fatherly will, thy euerlasting counsaile, thy healthfull word pleasure which is alwaies good, perfect and holy, and that may fulfill ye same with all possible care and dylige~ce, that thy diuine name may be alwaies sanctyfied voth nowe and euermore of me miserable siner.
Inspire my mynde with thy heauenly spirite, that my wayes maye be directed accordinge to thy Godly wyll and commaundeme~ts, that my féete slyde not out of the pathes of righteousnesse, yt my mynde imagine not vpon wickednes, yt my tongue speake no blasphemies against thée, but that all my thoughtes, wordes works, maye bée to guided by thy ye grace neuer prouoke thy wrathe nor displeasure against me, as for my sinns and offences of my youth, besech thée to put them out of thy remembraunce for thy great mercyes sake and neuer thinke vpon the~ hereafter.
For confesse and acknowledge that am a miserable and wretched sinner, haue wandred out of the waye of vertue synce my youth, ond haue folowed the brutishe inclination of my corrupt nature, like ye sencelesse beastes of the earthe, whose eyes are still fatsened on the ground, consideringe no further the~ the time present, without any knowlege or fore sight of the time to come.
Thou knowest Lorde that am but haye grasse, that flourisheth this day, and to morowe is cut downe and cast into the fornice: so little hould or staye is there in the lyfe of man, yt he cannot assure himselfe of one houre longer then thy good pleasure shall permitt him.
Ten times happy therfore is he that can spend this little tyme of being, which thou haste graunted him according to the rules and pre+cepts of thy holy commaundements.
Wherefore sith am but mortall, made of earth and ashes, and always prone to fall from thy statutes, illuminate beseche thée, the eclipsed eyes of my grosse vnderstanding, with the lighte of thy heauenly spirite, that maye spende this day, and all the rest of my lyfe hereafter in suche wyse as my doinges may be acceptable in thy sight, and co~modious to the common welthe through our onely Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ.
Mercifull God and heauenly Father, whether sléepe or wake, liue or dye am alwaies thine, wherefore beséech thée hartelie that thou wilt vouchsafe to take care and charge of me, and not to suffer me to perishe in the works of darkenesse, but to kyndle the light of thy countenaunce in my hart, that thy godly konwledge maye daylie encrease in me through a righte and a pure fayth, and that may alwaies be found to liue walke after thy will pleasure, to haue my minde and cogitacions bent vpon thee, whether sléepe or wake or what thing else so euer doo that may stick fast to thée, by a pure vnspotted faith, in my sauiour Christ Iesus.
Be thou (O merciful father) my watch man and my keper, fro~ ye terryble assaults of Sathan, and his wicked ministers, kepe my harte from the imaginations of iniquitie, yt may be pure in thée, and an vnspotted spouse to thy Sonne Christ Iesus.
When laye downe my selfe, to recreat my lims with sléepe, which thou hast appoynted for the satisfactio~ of my trayle bodie, let mee not be troubled or assayled with any vncleane cogitations, but keepe my mynde stil waking in thée, to repose my trust in thy mercy, that ye externall eyes of my hart maye be euermore excercised in meditacio~ of the comfortable promise.
To whom with the Father, the Sonne and the holy ghost be all honor and glory now and euer more.
Almighty god and moste mercifull Father, whom the tables of thy commaundementes, deliuered to the handes of thy seruant Mayses vpon the Mount Sina: among other precepts diddest geue charge vnto thy chosen children of Israell, that in six dayes they shoulde doe all such workes and labours, as they had to doe, and reste from laboure the seuenth day: graunt we besech thée, that since we haue happelie passed ouer this whole weke vnder thy gracious protection, we maye not onely rest this day from our daily trauailes but that we maye abstayne also from the works of sinne and iniquitie, and sanctifie this daye to thée, wt prayers and thankes geuing, abou~ding in all works of loue and charitie, as thou hast in thy holy worde, that we may be fou~d pure without spotte or blemish at that daye when thy Sonne Iesus Christe shall come to iudge the world wt righteousnesse and equitie.
And forasmuch as thou hast ordayned this daye amonge the rest wherin we shoulde méete altogeather with brotherly loue and affection, to yealde thee prayses for the innumerable benefites we haue receaued at thy hande, to acknowledge thy fatherly loue and pittie towardes vs from tyme to tyme, and to geue thee thankes in generall for all and vniuersall thy benifites hitherto bestowed vpon vs, we humbly besech thée to graunte vs thy holie spirite that we maye be the more zelousely inflamed to serue thee in true holynesse and integritie of lyfe: by ye operation of that spirite we may kill all carnall lustes, vnlawfull pleasures, occupiscence, and all other spottes of vncleannesse, wherby we may be made thy childe by adopcion and grace, and our bodies ye temple of the holy ghost, beinge throughly purged and purified from the dregges of iniquitie and abhominotion.
Geue vs grace most mercifull Father, to spend this daye to thy pleasure in all good workes and charitie, proceding from an vndefiled faith in Christ Iesus, that we fall not into no kynde of daunger, but that all our doings may be by thy gouernaunce, to doe alwaies that is righteous in thy sight, through Iesus Christ our Lord.
WE re~der vnto thée euer+lasting prayses (most mercifull Father) for that of thy gracious fauour and loue towardes vs, thou hast vouchsafed to preserue mee all this daye and the rest of my lyfe hetherto, vnder the shadowe of thy most mercifull protection: besechinge thee also to take me to thy tuition this present night euer, that we be not tempted with any suggestion of Sathan, but being throughly armed with ye holy ghost, we may haue power force to resiste hys assaultes by a sure fayth and confidence in ye bloud of thy blessed sonne, our Lord Sauiour Christ Iesus.
Geue vs grace to repent vs of our sinnes vnfainedly, to craue remission of them vncessantly, to embrace thy holy word and co~maundements sincerely, to expresse them in our lyuinge effectually: whereby we maye walke vprightly in our conuersation, with sure and certaine hope of resurrection to eternall life by the merites of Christ Iesus, that we may be founde wakinge and watchinge for his co~ming, when he shall come to iudge the worlde wyth equitie, and to reward euery man according to the works of his bodie.
Graunt vs grace most mercifull father, to behaue our selues so vprightly in this lyfe, that the~ we may be made pertakers of thy kingedome wyth thy elect: there to liue in eternall ioy and filicitie worlde without end.

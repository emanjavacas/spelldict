an account of the proceedings at the of the city of london on saturday september

with the substance of sir thomas player's speech and the lord mayor's answer thereunto
upon saturday september the thirteenth last past several hundreds of the principal citizens of london accompanied sir thomas player to wait upon the lord mayor and the court of aldermen sitting at where sir thomas player in the name of himself and all the inhabitants of this city addressed himself to his lordship to this purpose that it was apparent what advantage and encouragement the duke of york being a papist gave to the rise and progress of this horrid and damnable plot which the parliament had already declared to be one of the greatest encouragements that the papists had for the carrying of it on and that what they have already voted against the duke we all ought to take special notice of for though it came not up quite to a law yet it came very nigh it as being the voice of all the commons of england
and that both houses of parliament had unanimously declared this plot to have been contrived and still carrying on by papists against the life of his sacred majesty the protestant religion and the government of this kingdom

that therefore all protestants are fully satisfied the papists do still design the murder of his majesty but that they should find the english nation would value his majesties life at a higher rate than ever any princes life in europe has been at and that for his part he was not afraid of his own life especially upon so good an account for that he was very well assured that though his enemies should kill him they would but thereby hasten his departure to a greater glory
that there was a popish priest lately come in who had made a further and more clear discovery of the horrid design of murdering his majesty that the whole contrivance was managed at rome and was to have been suddenly executed here an account of which he did not doubt but would be published to the world in a short time that therefore they the citizens of london addressed themselves to his lordship as their head and chief magistrate in the city and did therefore desire his lordship that their guards might be doubled and that instead of two companies four might go out every night they not coming upon duty but once in twelve nights which would be very easie and which charge the citizens were very willing to bear especially since they apprehend that there is as great a necessity to strengthen our hands now as when there went out eight companies in a night their present danger being rather greater
he offered also one politick reason to his lordship which was this that the late long parliament and also the last parliament took so much notice of the great charge care and diligence of the city for the preservation of his majesties person and the protestant interest which had so much influence toward the preserving of the whole kingdom that they were extremely inclined to shew their good affection and kindness to the city by all ways imaginable and that therefore the slackning their care and guards at such a time as this when danger seems as apparent as ever and the fears and jealousies of the people are so very great as the like were hardly ever known might possibly it may in some measure lessen that kindness to the city in the next parliament which was so remarkable in the last since it is no way to be doubted but the popish faction will endeavor by all means imaginable to make the councels and advices of the next parliament ineffectual that it cannot be forgot that thirteen years ago this city was a sad monument of the papists cruelty being brought into a most deplorable condition by their cursed designs being now out of all doubt that it was they that burnt the city and if they had not been disappointed would have cut our throats too at the same time while we were endeavoring to save the small remainder of our goods which the fire had left unconsumed that though men may seem to be regardless of their own lives yet when the lives of their wives children and their estates also are like to be destroyed in the general ruine it calls for pity from the most careless
and that therefore it was high time for us to seek the preservation of the whole by all ways in our power concluding that he would desire his lordship to proceed in this great and necessary affair as god should direct him
with several other excellent expressions to this purpose which we should have been very glad if it had been possible for us to have repeated
at the end hereof the people gave a very great shout and his lordship desired them to withdraw

after a short time the citizens were called in and his lordship gave them an answer to this purpose
that he had considered of their desires and was very willing to gratifie them and thanked them for their care and zeal for the preservation of the kings life and of the protestant religion
and then told them that he could not answer their desires of himself without calling the lieutenancy and therefore he would cause the lieutenancy to meet on thursday next that being the first day that would be at liberty from other business already assigned or else they should have been called sooner for his lordship told them that he would lose no time in it his lordship also further assuring them that as he had both a life and an estate so he should readily and frankly hazard the loss of both in defence of the protestant religion his lordship was also pleased to declare that he was very well satisfied that there was no person who served the city of london in the quality of an alderman but would be ready to spend his blood for the preservation of the protestant cause
his lordship also desired that for the time to come they would not be so numerous in their addresses since they might as well make known their minds by few as by many especially having so worthy a person to speak for them as sir thomas player and therefore desired that sir thomas player with half a dozen of the most eminent citizens would meet the lieutenancy on thursday next for that by so numerous an assembly as was then present they might possibly give some occasion of offence
his lordship also told them that he hoped before thursday next there might something fall out that might very much conduce to take away the cause of their present fears for that he was very well assured the duke of york was making preparations for his departure on tuesday or wednesday next

his lordship having ended his speech sir thomas player spake to this effect
that he did not doubt but that his lordship would take all the care that was possible for the security of this city and the protestant religion and the safety and preservation of the kings life in the first place upon which not only the happiness of this city but of the whole nation depended and that he took the more liberty so to speak because it was very well known though to the grief of all good protestants that there are a certain sort of men who make it their business to lessen the plot and some would make it no plot at all others say that it was a plot made by the protestants and then cast upon the papists others would have it to be altogether a protestant plot and that this sort of persons were the most dangerous and had been deservedly styled protestants in masquerade adding that he had rather have to do with an open profest papist than with one of these disguised protestants for that an open enemy was much more eligible than a false friend but he hoped that in a little time such kind of persons would be taken notice of and receive the reward due to their merits
after this the court adjourn'd into the common hall in order to the choosing a sheriff for the year ensuing where several being nominated the choice seemed to be between mr lewis and mr jenks and because it appeared somewhat doubtful a poll was desired which being made the choice fell upon mr lewis who was chosen accordingly

postscript
it cannot reasonably be expected that the speech of this worthy and deserving knight nor the lord mayor's generous reply thereunto should be published exactly since in so great a concourse it was hardly possible to be taken however least so considerable a transaction should be altogether buried in silence we have endeavoured to give as full an account thereof as could be done by strength of memory which we hope will therefore be kindly accepted instead of a more correct copy
